My wife's sister was visiting from outta town and my wife insisted showing her the amazing cenote. Well my comments are the same the menu remained the same as my last as there were only two things on the menu for vegetarians. If you're vegetarian pleeeease don't go there. Its not so much how much variety you have, but rather what. I mean I felt for a pasta and all the waiter could offer me with it was butter on the pasta..can you imagine? So guess what, I ordered the Lasagna which I had the last time. Even my wife and sister who's not vegetarians were not impressed with the menu and what they ordered. I guess this very expensive restaurant what you're really paying for is the ambience of the cenote\u2026\"thats it\""

            "review": "Amazing. The review beneath is not correct at all. Taxis in Playa del Carmen are the cheapest i have taken anywhere in the world. I never paid more than 3 USD. Perhaps the reviewer wasn't aware that in Latin countries one has to set the price before you get in the cab. One has to learn the customs of the country one is visiting or subject yourself to ridicule. Second, many cultures eat grasshoppers. its not the end of the world. Anyhow, this restaurant is lovely, it is a real cave, yes it is dark but our waitress made sure to shine her flashlight on all our dishes when they arrived and explained what everything on them was before we ate. This is a real cave, so it is a bit damp/humid, however the restaurant has AC and fans going on full blast so that customers don't feel hot. Everything was lovely, the service was attentive but not annoying, the music playing on the speakers was lovely-jazzy slowed down versions of popular pop songs- and then a live musician came out with his guitar (we went on a tuesday night) we made a reservation and good thing we did as the restaurant filled up quickly after 7pm. The food and drinks were expensive yes, however everything was of the highest quality. I never eat at fine dining locations because I'm cheap and not fussy, however it was a birthday occasion so we picked something \"fancy\"; the food and drink were worth the price. I ate the wild pig and it was insanely good, the mashed potatoes with cheese were next level amazing. My friends had the surf and turf and the cowboy steak, huge portions. Spent about 200USD on three people, 3 entrees, two drinks and two deserts+a generous tip. They gave the birthday boy a free desert. This is a complex and there are several areas, a bar, a restaurant, a lounge with a stage. During the week when we were there only the restaurant/bar were open. There are some folks dressed in traditional Mayan gear at the entrance and will take a picture (For money). Verdict: yes its pricey, but its not average food/drink; this is a \"once in a lifetime\" kinda thing, very cool to try/experience, worth the extra money for those that are hesitating due to price. how often can you dine in a legitimate cave?"

The atmosphere was very nice and there is a tour after you eat. The price per meal is high for Playa standards, but comparable to Houston, Texas. I had the Cowboy steak and my wife had the Surf and Turf and with our multiple Mai Tai's and tip our bill only came to $100 USD. Must stop destination in Playa!"

Our waitress was super nice and answered all our questions. The prices are a bit high compared to the restaurants on 5th Ave. My husband and I had been eating for an average of $500 pesos on 5th Ave. Here we had no appetizers, 2 alcoholic drinks, 2 entr\u00e9es (the less expensive about $350, there are some that are $1300 for 2 people), no dessert and it came to $1,144 with the tip which they include. The food was good, but it was not your usual large portion. It was fresh and hot."

I liked the fact that each dining section gets a name. If you r looking for a private dining experience whether in a group or just your date, there r areas to fit the need. I came with a large group so we were seated in an area to fit our group. But I saw a little nook and it was for two. So romantic! There are sofas next to the dining area as well. So if you eat to much, you can take a nap on it lol As for the food, it was ok. I'd come for drinks but not for food."

We would go back to Playa del Carmen just to go to this restaurant again, the ambiance, food and service were all excellent, it was one of the high points of our trip! Low points actually, as it is located in a subterranean cavern, beautifully lit with dramatic lighting, you feel like you are stepping down into another planet. There are various sizes of private \"rooms\" if you want to have a party, or romantic dinner just the two of you. So if you have a special event, or even if you don't, take a taxi to this place, it's not in the tourist district but is well worth the 150 pesos to get there, and they will have a taxi waiting for you when you get out."

My last visit was the worst as everything I asked for they did not have. I am a vegetarian and looking at the menue was my first disappointment. There were maybe two options open to me which was Veg Lazzanga and some other thing, can't remember the name, but was supposed to be a chile stuffed with vegetables which the waitress highly recommended. However, when it was brought to the table, I was left looking for the chili in the dark as what was brought to me looked like an exotic Burrito stuffed with vegetables. In addition, when we sat at the table, a glass of water is yet to be served. After the meal, I asked for decaf coffee and was told \"there wasn't any\", I asked for ice cream and was also told \"there wasn't any\". I mean what restaurant doesn't serve ice cream? By this time, I had enough of the\"there isn't any\" and just wanted to leave. I believe the reason I have been four times, was because I had guest and wanted to show them the undeniable amazing ambience of the place.."

I could not believe that this place was in Playa del Carmen all this time and we never came across it before. My husband and i first discovered the caverns and cenotes in Mexico about 8 years ago. When I saw that this restaurant was in a cavern I knew we had to go.The menu online shows the wild game specialty dinners so I didn't realize they had other dishes. If I had seen the entire menu online I would have booked dinner too. The cavern has many private dining areas, romantic or party- both can be easily accomodated. You will never experience a dining atmosphere like this. I suggest you stop in for a drink, coffee, a meal, or dessert. It was a fabulous experiece. and the dessert was awesome."

It was just really perfect for a romantic dinner for my husband and I. They allow you to go around the whole cavern to explore, and man is it neat. They have private tables setup all over that are so exotic looking with extra large candles. There is a dark cave with candles lit that is almost spooky. So, it's not just a restaurant but a genuine site to explore. The food is excellent too. I got the beef medallions with potatoes and they put an incredible spin on it. I can still taste the buttery potatoes with a hint of tangy pepper, mixed with my rare bite of tender beef. The sauce was super yummy! Keep up the good work guys of making the food delicious. Service was excellent too by our polite English speaking waitress. I would have probably enjoyed hot dog in this atmosphere, but they really do their best to make everything perfect!"

I was planning to propose to her and was doing a lot of research to get ideas of where/when to do it. We always try to go to one very unique restaurant on each vacation and Alux was unlike any place either of us had ever seen. I knew it would be the perfect place to propose. I contacted the restaurant on a Sunday and the public relations manager, Alejandra, got back to me almost immediately, asking what I was looking to do, when I wanted to do it, and the various options for dining areas that were available. I was recommended to rent a private room (very reasonably priced) and to let Alux Restaurant handle to rest. Alejandra told me \"everything would be fine\"; and it was. Actually, the proposal was perfect! We walked into the restaurant and the hostess brought us to the private room, which had been lit with candle light and covered in rose petals. I gave the ring to our waiter and we enjoyed a few drinks and dinner while taking in the amazing atmosphere provided by the restaurant. After dinner, the waiter and busboy cleared the table and brought out the dessert plate. He took off the cover and on one side was the dessert, and the other was the ring. He even took pictures with our phone so we would never forget the proposal. My fiance was SO surprised and we could not have been happier with the outcome. The next day, Alejandra emailed me to ask how everything went and was very happy to hear my response. Thank you, Alux Restaurant for helping to make this happen!"

Trip Advisor has never failed us :)This restaurant is beautiful from the inside. When you first walk to the very front of it, you think, \"What? This can't be it?\" But as soon as you walk in, you're greeted by Aztec warriors (yes, it's just a costume). And then you walk down the stairs into this beautiful place. The food was really good. I wish I could remember the name of the plate I ordered. It had lobster, shrimp, and steak with delicious vegetables and mashed potatoes. The drinks were pretty strong as well.As we waited for the food, we walked into the cavern and explored it. Make sure to bring a camera and take lots of pictures. It was breathtaking to see God's creations. I live in Houston, Texas and if this restaurant existed here, it would cost you at least $100-150 per plate. We paid a total of $85 for myself, my husband, and my son. Please note, my husband and I shared the plate because it was a lot of food. The price was completely worth it. I went in there thinking we were going to spend approximately $300 judging by the looks of this beautiful place, so when we got the check I was like, \"Is that it?\" Totally worth the price and the view :) PS: This place is located on a pretty busy street. Make sure to use google maps to find it. As mentioned before, you won't think you're at the right place when you arrive because it doesn't look this fabulous from the outside. Hope this review helps you. Please feel free to email me if you have further questions. Thanks."

If you like a pause between courses I recommend you request this in advance).The cocktails are very good- I tried the rose petal martini and I recommend it.After dinner we walked around the caverns including the private rooms. It is actually a huge place with lots of potential!The food portions have a nice size but the food could be better. Starters were just ok. Mains.. A bit dissapointed.. The pasta was very overcooked and the chicken was undercooked ( they kindly cooked it further for us). We did not complaint as we went there already knowing from other reviews food was not great. We were there for the experience, not for the food. If the food was better this would be a massive hit in Playa del Carmen for everybody to talk about it!I would go back if I was to show the place to people who has not yet been there but we would probably just have a couple of starters and drinks and go somewhere else for dinner.I would give it a four star as an experience but a two star as a restaurant."

The food was very good and huge portions. They had a specialty drink menu and the wine was also great. We had a chance to explore the cave following dinner. The service was fantastic as well. Overall it was a truly enjoyable experience!"

Our server Enmanual was excellent, informative and spoke perfect English. We had an early seating so the restaurant was not very crowded. They do not allow children after a certain hour, which makes for a very quiet dinner. When we first got there they had just opened for the evening and there was kind of a funky smell, but that went away after a little while. It is very dark, we had to use our cell phones to read the menu. I had accessed their website before going so we pretty much knew what was on the menu. You are can walk around the restaurant and take photos and videos. It is very interesting. If you are looking for a unique dining experience, this is a definite."

This restaurant and bar operates within a natural cavern, making it a unique place for a special dinner.The cavern complex is quite large and beautifully illuminated. Tables are spread between the main dining cavern that features a Xenote, and smaller sitting areas surrounded by stalactites/stalagmites in current formation.Service was excellent and very prompt, despite the fact that there was a large group sitting next to us who ordered at the same time.Food quality and taste were outstanding, and drinks were well prepared.Owner Rolando Calderon was sitting next to us, constantly supervising that everything ran smoothly. He told me about the effort that had gone into setting up the restaurant, and it definitely shows that it is a work of love.Make sure to reserve with time. For a romantic dinner, reserve one of the intimate tables within the cavern complex. We didn't have wine, but the selection within the Cava was excellent. Walk the interesting cavern complex after dinner. Don't be surprised if you see a bat or two - you are a guest in their millennial home.Highly recommended! A definite must if you are in the area! I agree with the ratings showing Alux as one of the top bars in the world."

So we took a Collectivo from the Barcelo Maya into Playa. We arrived on time and entered through the front entry down the stairs. The hostess in the beautiful lounge area walked us over to our table. I tell you, my mouth was wide open as she walked us to our seats. INCREDIBLE is all I can say.This is a truly spectacular venue and so unique. There are different colored lights the light up various coves and grotto\u2019s throughout the cenote. There was also a lovely little waterfall. After we ordered drinks and our meals we were told we could explore \u2013 I recommend anyone going there should take the chance to explore. It seems to go on forever with tons of secret little lounge areas with amazing chandeliers hanging from the cenote ceiling. Our food was amazing. We had the goat cheese peppers to start. My husband had the stuffed chicken and I had the duck. It was all delicious. While we ate there was really funky lounge music playing.If you can only eat at one restaurant in Playa Del Carmen, I suggest this be your selection. One thing to note \u2013 it was very warm so make sure you\u2019re not dressed too warmly. They have fans blowing but it was still pretty steamy!It's on the pricier side - over $100 for the two of us but well worth it."

Lovely presentation of dishes.Chicken was delicious. \"Beef medallions\" very tough -- I think they were flank steak or something similar. Certainly not tenderloin. No wine list -- instead you get a guided tour of the wine cave to select a wine. Interesting cocktail menu, but difficult to select because of unfamiliar ingredients. Did not offer traditional Mexican drinks (at least on drink menu). Recommend:- Don't overdress. We expected to be chilly underground, but instead it was rather warm/ humid. Fans going everywhere. - Ask for a table near a fan and with good lighting - Take a cab (pronounce the name \"Ah-loosh\") for 100 pesos.- Walk all around the cave after your meal."

Tender duck served in a cranberry and strawberry sauce. Nelson had the beef and pawn dish. His steak was cooked perfectly, his prawn was massive! The presentation/plating was also DIVINE!Laura also treated us to an amazing display of fire when serving us our birthday dessert on the house! Flaming ouzo, poured over a lime crumble with starfruit and vanilla ice cream. Absolutely marvalous.Our Waitress also recommended us a fabulous local rose wine after listening to my preferences. (not too dry, sweet as can be) I'll be looking at all my specialty import wine sections at home for this. I'll be quite sad if I can't find it!Laura was the greatest <3 This place is so spectacular just on it's own, but Laura took it up a notch. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!Thank you Laura, and the talented chefs at Alux. I don't know how I'm ever going to top this Birthday surprise for Nelson ever again.

Our food was \"ok\". we ordered the special and unfortunately, were not overwhelmed with the quality. The food was \"warm\" but not hot and the shrimps were extremely overdone and dry. Next time, I think we would choose something other than the special. Other reviews have said the food was amazing and I would definitely give the staff a second chance.

We had the surf and turf platter that included many lobster tails, shrimp, 2 Fila and 2 flank steaks as well as all the fixings.

We found an ad for it in 2014 in a touristic/shopping part of Playa del Carmen, which tends to be located in a close proximity to the beach. Conversely, Alux is on the other side of Carretera 307 and anyone who traveled this road knows that resorts are located on one side of it and cenotes plus caves and underground river parks - on the other. Alux is exactly this - a restaurant within a significant cenote/cave structure and is therefore just great place to be in and to walk around. However, there is no way I would be writing this review had the food also not been absolutely excellent (and inventive). There are many things to try (we had a party of six the first time and a party of eight, when we returned there in 2015 and everyone was quite satisfied with his/her meal). Cocktails are priced very reasonably (especially compared to Playa's 5th Avenue) and Mayan Coffee is a must. This is a very short ride from downtown hotels and Playacar resorts."

To get out of the cab onto this nondescript street and through the gate,,,to where the adventure begins. You walk down, down, down into the earth and find yourself at a hostess station from where you are led through room after room to a table under a crystal chandelier. The food was good, but it really could have been bad and you would still have had a great experience. We had our Thanksgiving meal here, hoping to forget we were doing without the stuffing this year, and couldn't have been happier with the choice. The lighting was subtle colors that pulled you into anti-rooms that were wine cellars, lounge areas and many other dining rooms. Then, just after dinner, the live music started which, with a Drambuie and coffee, was the perfect nightcap. Although a bit pricey, but nothing like the prices at the Caves in Jamaica. And, the staff was super. They accommodated two youngsters who were kind of over trying new foods and wanted just some pasta. Highly recommend to anyone looking for an unusual experience."

All of our main courses were excellent, Beef Medallions, Fresh Catch of the Day, surf & turf and Chile Lindo.We took a tour of the restaurant after dinner, the whole place was incredible!Hopefully they will resolve the issues of the standing water in front of the bar (there are planks set up so you're feet don't get wet) and the warmth and stuffiness of the cave. You would think a cave would be nice and cool, definitely not the case, prepare to be warm. Even with all the fans running, it was quite stuffy. Regardless, I would definitely go back."

Overall, the greeting was somewhat confusing, then there was some sort of run-off causing either a mini-river or spill through the main hallway forcing all guests to either pre-plan to wear their galoshes or constantly be 'walking the plank', literally if they needed to use the washroom. But, you are eating in a freaking cave! And that in itself is very cool. They have the whole thing lit up with various colours and the cave is actually a bunch of separate adjoining cave sections. We had our own private dining area and they had strewn rose petals all about for the celebration of my wife's birthday. We shared the Surf & Turf, which had an odd mix of flavours. The tenderloin was great, where the flank steak left a lot to be desired. All of the seafood left something to be designed because it was all overcooked. The shrimp was at least seasoned, where the lobster tails, while generously portioned lacked flavour.The 'tower of roasted vegetables' from the menu consisted from one slice of plantain and one slice of zucchini.I was surprised how incredibly hot and moist it was in Alux. Had I been warned, I would have dressed down significantly rather than trying to 'dress to impress' as I had.Without the dedicated fan on us, it would have been unbearable.Service was snappy and friendly and the pictures came out great. I would recommend Alux for the experience. Also, I believe that the table we were at had been used to film an episode of The Bachelor so, for fans of the show like my wife, it's a must stop if you're in the neighnorhood."

However, if you're claustrophobic, this is not the right place for yo to dine.You definitely pay for the location since food and drink are both overpriced. The hostess was accommodating, and the service was average. We ordered the two salads on the men, which were small. Followed by the lobster with a butter sauce and a hint of garlic and lime, we finished off with a fat bill with already added tip for a mediocre taste and quality. I recommend a walk through the cave and just a drink if they allow it."

Ask the staff and they will let you tour around the private dining areas and the incredible bar. The steak we had (T-bone) was the best we have had in Mexico. Our server Emmanuel was incredible. The main hostess and Emmanuel made sure fans were placed and even brought out a special dessert once they heard it was our luna de miel (Honeymoon). Even when he was seated with a huge group near us Emmanuel made sure everything was perfect and checked in at just the right frequency . Wonderful job and you must try it. It is not the cheapest place in Playa del Carmen for sure - but for us with drinks and dinner it was $102 U.S. which is very reasonable for a memorable experience. It is humid - so light clothes are best and the staff can redirect a fan if needed."

They were out of lobster when we arrived and since so many of their dishes have lobster, it limited our choices. They had 2 choices of white wine by the glass, I ordered the sauvignon blanc and it was horrible. As an appetizer my husband and I shared the seafood trio which was ok. Since we couldn't get the seafood platters my husband got the duck which was fantastic and I ordered the Mayab Medalion but it was really just steak, didn't have the bacon it described on the menu so either our server gave me the wrong dish or they were out of bacon. Either way, it was ok. For some reason our server didn't think to ask us if we wanted separate bills and gave us one big bill. He apologized and manually calculated what each of us had so we could pay accordingly. From what we saw only tax was added to the bill, not the tip. While our server sorted out the bill we took a walk around the cave and it is simply spectacular.Would we go back? probably not, but we were all glad to have had the experience of eating in a cave :)"

I didn't find it difficult ... they had lots of fans circulating the air but don't go expecting it to be like a perfectly air conditioned building. It's a cave. My husband and I went in the last few days with a group of 6 couples. We were looking forward to dining there after a recommendation from someone in our group who had been there before. The setting is not to be missed - the restaurant is laid out around a cave with larger areas for the main dining and bar areas and smaller coves for more intimate dining. I found the atmosphere to be lovely.When you have such a draw (a restaurant it an cave!) they could be lazy with the food and service and still draw people in. This was not the case. The food was decent and the service excellent and the cost was about 1/2 what we would pay in Canada for a similar dinner. My only disappointment was that we were charged for water even though we all had full dinner with drinks. I have read reviews by people who have complained about the gratuity being included but that's pretty normal for Canada, especially when you go with a large group and all have separate bill.s"

The seafood trio was expensive and bland with a very small portion. The pasta for our lobster ravioli was rubbery, and the cheese sauce was pasty. The bread in the basket was underbaked. The server added his own tip to the bill, more than what is customary for Mexico, and more than what we would have given him...But what are you going to say when he's already added it?Other than the fact that we were eating in a cave - which is amazing - it was a lack lustre experience for a special night out. We don't splurge often, and this experience was disappointing. If you don't factor in the aspect of the cave, I'd give it a 6/10. Go for an expensive cocktail...Have dinner elsewhere. "

What seems like a small cave entrance turns out to be a massive recessed cave that you can walk all through, hear the water dripping, even sit very far in where it's muggy and, well, cave-like. 3. The servers are very friendly. 4. There's a translation section on the menu. 5. They take Visa / MC. 6. The food is upscale compared to other local restaurants. Now, the cons:1. The food, though up-scale for Playa, I'd rate 6/10 max. 2. The bathroom was disgusting. 3. The dinnerware and table settings felt old, and a little cheap. 4. The cocktails were crazy expensive, more than a Canadian/US restaurant. All in all, very unique, very romantic, very worth going to!"

We went on a Saturday night with 24 hour notice and had no problem getting a great table.The one small issue was we ordered a seafood platter for two (Lobster tails, squid, Sea Bass etc...) Our server reccomended a certain oyster dish as an appetizer which we got. It was just ok. Well the seafood dish we ordered (most expensive selection on menu) also had the same portion of the reccomended appetizer. Obviously we would not have ordered the same thing twice.

We had spent the day in Tulum exploring the Cenotes and this was the perfect finish to the day. Having dinner in a beautiful cave? No way! Yes way!! Right from the entrance you are transported to another world. I have been in many caves but never one like this! Beautifully decorated, with various spots for private dinners, parties etc....We chose the Surf and Turf and it was delectable! Tender, mouth watering and the sauce was to die for! Drinks were lovely and our waitress was always checking that everything was as we wanted. I seriously can not find anything to complain about! Service - amazing. Food - amazing. Atmosphere - BEYOND AMAZING! After dinner we walked all around to see all the areas....it was late, almost closing so we stopped at one of the bars to have another drink and then toured around a little longer. I was sad to leave this place! One of the highlights of my trip I must say!!"

Finally, on our fourth trip to Playa, we got smart and started asking the taxi drivers for their recommendations on the best places to dine in Playa and found this unique restaurant that is a welcome break from the new mall development underway on 5th Avenue. The ambiance at Alux is warm and inviting, despite the fact you're in an underground world. Our waiter, Lalo, was extremely attentive and did an exellent job of explaining the specials. Surf and Turf was done to perfection. Pork medallions were tender and delicious. Presentation was classy and priced right. We recommend topping off your meal wth Cafe Maya...it's always fun to see someone play with fire, and the result is a delicious after-dinner drink that packs a great punch! Don't forget to explore the caves...very fun. Oh, did I menttion the margaritas are the best we've experienced so far in Playa del Carmen?"

They brought some bread with no spread or oilnof any kind and the bread itself had a funny taste, like old.The appetizer was cold and poorly made.The main course portion was so small that we left the restaurant hungry.Just to wrap it up, is worth going in for a drink, take some pictures and eat somewhere eles.

You can just go for drinks, and I have done that on several occasions.They have a very interesting drink menu and several bars to visit within the underground network of caves. You enter through the front door from the sidewalk and immediately descend a wide,stone staircase into the caverns below street level. There is a small river running through the dining room area, and there are a series of caverns and caves spreading underground, connected by winding stone,corridors. Everything is electrically lit, the ceilings are high- it is not at all claustrophobic or uncomfortable.There are several different bars, there is even a dance floor with a big,stone stage- never heard live music there, but they have it. As you wander through the various caves, you will find little private seating nooks set up with couches and chairs and tables with candles. This place is just so COOL! I have never seen anything like it. ( note: one reviewer mentioned a tour of the cenotes....there are no cenotes down there!). I tell all my friends about Alux- you really should check this place out!"

Yes, it was hot, but well worth it and if you ask, the waiter/waitress will bring a big fan right over to the table. Our waitress gave us fabulous tips on where to go in the area and what to see, she even wrote down a handful of her favorite places with directions for us! Every mean on our table was exquisite, four star dining for sure! After our meal, our waitress offered to take us on a tour of he cave. She told us the history and the Mayan beliefs for each room of the cave. The restaurant is a bit out of tourist central which was a wonderful change. Make reservations and sit near the cenote or book a private room of the cave for a family event. Can't say enough of how much we enjoyed this restaurant! I think we spent upwards of 3 hours there! Considering the location, the quality of food and the atmosphere, the prices were very reasonable! For the only cave restaurant left in the world, Alux is a must see!!"

There were several rooms within the cave system including one that had been turned into a bar and stage. The atmosphere was unbelievable. It was very romantic with artful lighting. This enhanced the dramatic nature of the cave. It was almost museum quality in ambience. The temperature was a little warm but the fans that were situated around the restaurant were very helpful. We were a group of fifteen but the restaurant easily accommodated us. The server was happy to provide us with individual bills which made the billing situation much easier. The food was very good - international in flavour - the seafood of the day was mahi mahi which was very tasty - others in our group enjoyed the quail.

We arrived half an hour before our reservation and were seated as soon as we walked in. My wife and I both commented on the rather fast service and good food. She had a rib-eye steak ( too big to finish) and I had Alux Surprise (catch of the day). Quite possibly the best tasting fish I have ever had.I could not pronounce the kind of fish so can not remember now. One thing... bring a flashlight to read the menu."

We arrived thinking that the butler where we were staying had made reservations for us like I had asked, but we had none when we arrived. After about a 20 minute wait, the hostess was able to make a table for my party of three and seat us. This was extremely nice of her because we were told that Sundays were reservation only nights. The food that everyone had was really good, our waiter was very attentive and he did a little show for me with heat and liquor. It was very cool, got some great pictures! The dessert he gave me was pretty good too. This is a very nice restuarant, a great concept, and very enjoyable. An excellent spot to visit while in Playa."

The waiters are very friendly.However, the food (main dish priced from 200 to 350 pesos) does not live up to the standards for such a price range. My fish was fried and late at night I had stomach ache. It was also not very tasty. It is also one of the few restaurants where you get the bill with 15% mark-up for the tip. I always thought that it is on me to determine how much to leave for tip depending on how happy I am with the service. Interesting, but not the only restaurant in Mexico where this happened to me.Overall, you have to see this place but be careful with the orders."

The facility itself is set within a cenote which is breathtaking. As other reviewers have said, It is a little humid inside but when we said something our server immediately brought a fan close to our table and problem solved!! We ordered the oyster app, 4 drinks, rib eye, and surf and turf.. With tip that came to $118 which I think is very reasonable. The oysters were my favorite part and the steaks were cooked to perfection! Our waiter took us on a tour of the cave and was very knowledgable about the preservation of this natural beauty, he offered to take many pictures for us. I would recommend this place to anyone!

We went to El Alux last week off the suggestion of our resort bartender and reviews of TA, and I'll say that the cave is absolutely stunning. The food on the other hand was completely subpar as was the wine list. We were sorely disappointed which is too bad because this place has so much potential. We split the surf and turf...my god it was like cutting through a piece of leather. Our service wasn't the best either but I think that was more of an issue with our sweet little waitress who could barely spoke a word of english. Little tips about the place: dress in cool attire because it's warm in the cave. Ladies should not wear heels or at least be prepared to take them off for your descent into the cave. Would I go back? Only if someone in my group wanted to see it. I'm in kind of the mind set been there done that. That being said I would totally recommend going for a drink. The cave is that amazing. Cheers"

What an experience to eat underground in an actual cave with cenotes, tunnels, and stalgmites. I had prime rib, absolutely delishous. My daughter had roast duck which she enjoyed immensely. My grandson and aunt had chicken dishes. Everything was cooked just right. We order two bottles of wine. The total came to about $280 including tip. Not bad at all!!! Service was good. There is no air conditioning there and was a bit stuffy. We mentioned it to the waiter, who brought one of the big fans closer to us, which helped some. We took a tour of the cave/restaurant and discovered that one of the wait staff had previously lived in South Philadelphia and had attended the same high school that I had. What a small world. They called the taxi driver for us when we were done."

It's quite a way up Avenida Juarez on the left hand side - just about walkable from the resort but recommend taking a short taxi ride for only about 40 - 50 pesos from Quinta Avenida. We had a couple of drinks there on a Thursday night. You also have the option to eat in the bar f you don't want to sit down in the restaurant area for a meal. I have to say nothing stood out for us on the menu but we were free to explore the caves and walkways by ourselves. It's a little surreal but beautiful and very atmospheric! Reminded me of the scene in Phantom of the opera where the phantom hides out underground in his lair!Staff were friendly and good music playing. The bar was almost empty when we went which was surprising as I'd read lots of reviews and thought it would be packed. A bit of a shame as lacked a bit of buzz / atmosphere but then again it was quite surreal having it all to ourselves!"

There are not many places that can give you the experience of having dinner or drinks in a cave. From the first flight of stairs you descend you can tell you are in a very special place. The lighting is romantic (lots and lots of rod iron candelabras and chandelliers) and the mood is classy. No hip-hop or blaring music here, the mood music was more Tony Bennet and Michael Buble which was welcoming and relaxing. The hostess asked if we had a reservation (we did not). I guess the encourage one for dinner but we were only interested in drinks which she said was fine as long as we ordered $100 Mexican Peso minimum which is really only about 8 US dollars.She led us to a bar area which was strategically underlit in blue lights and had comfortable tables, chairs and couches scattered around. The only \"off\" thing in the room was a Red Bull neon light. Whoever hung that should note it was out of character with the rest of the cave, but maybe they thought it was appropriate for the bar area. Our waiter not only came to take our drink orders but offered us a tour of the cave. Parts of the cave were surprising hot and sticky with large fans circulating the air. There were lots of little nooks set up with intimate dining seating - chandelliers, white table cloths, beautiful seating. Upon leaving we were assisted with catching a cab back to Playa's Fifth Avenue. It is only a $5 USD cab ride away - I'd encourage other tourists to check this place out!"

I understand it is owned by the government and therefore has some sort of protection from over development. It is an amazing, large system of caves with stalectites and mites, beautifully lit with very special and different types of seating areas. It looks like there is a dance - music area and a restaurant. It is incredibly beautiful.We went around 6pm and it was empty. There was a minimum charge of around \u00a35 each person, which is expensive for Mexico. We had cocktails which were nice but ther service was not good. Having said that, it is such a large place that it would be difficult to keep an eye on customers but there were few attendants and they seemed elusive.In all it is worth a visit."

Walk down the stairs at the entrance to a huge cenote. Each little nook and cranny is a different little dining area. Furniture is eclectic but tasteful with a modern twist. The restaurant is very popular so reservations are required. Even so,... they lost our reservation! Tsk. With just a little drama from us and two other couples in the same predicament, we were all escorted to tables and my husband and I soon forgot about the trouble. The food was fabulous. Drinks were great (and not watered down). And, the Mayan dancers that came in around 9 pm put on a wonderful show. Their very ancient dance told a story ... one that I hadn't seen danced by others like this. That was refreshing. There was quite a bit of suggesting from our waiter that we not only leave a tip on the bill but that we might perhaps slip him a tip personally that he would not have to split with the rest of the staff. I didn't really like this idea in the beginning but I looked around and saw this going on subtly by other guests and waiters/waitresses. And, in the end, I think our waiter did a great job and was very helpful and attentive. So, we slipped him a little more cash! :) El Alux is not near the beach nor near the trendy 5th Avenue strip in Playa Del Carmen. You'll likely need a taxi. And when you leave, there are usually taxis nearby (if not at the door.)A wonderful place to go ... a MUST SEE in Playa del Carmen. MUST SEE!"

Starting with the beautiful latina lady who greeted us graciously. The gentleman waiter who was always on the spot and very classy. Our appetizer of portabella mushroom was served as a beautifully dressed plate including a wonderful salad with a viniagrette of apple flavor. Simply devine and practically a meal in itself. All 3 of us ordered the Ribeye Sandye, we were very pleased. It was juicy, near melt in your mouth delicious with a bit of grill flavor. I was quite pleased. It was cooked med-rare just as I like it even though, typically for Mexico, only about 3/8\" thick, no problem. It was more than enough food. The ambiance was great, maybe a little dark, they do have penlights, if you need. The music was perfect. A soothing rendition of Pink Floyd sank by a sweet, soft female artist recording by a band named 'Buddha Bar' (?).We really enjoyed this most relaxing break.Tomorrow is off to sea turles in Akumal Beach.I do recommend at least once.

We arrive early, about 6 pm and there were only about 4 other tables occupied when we arrived. The wait staff was pleasant, just not very efficient. Many of the entrees sounded exciting but the actual food disappointed almost everyone at the table.Also, be aware that, at least in August, it is warm and humid in the restaurant. They use fans to help with that but they aren't sufficient to make the temperature and humidity enjoyable. The management did accommodate a request for another fan but the fan they brought was a very large and very noisy which made it difficult to carry on a conversation with the people seated right next to you.If Alux can upgrade their food to average or better and improve the responsiveness of their service, they will have an amazing dining experience that you won't find many other places."

He also added that some tourists had complained the food was bad. We still wanted to try it anyway! When we got their I was blown away by the d\u00e9cor of the place. Posh, modern, cozy and very intimate. I thought it was very romantic. It was a little humid, but of coarse you\u2019re in a cave what do you expect? The restaurant did have some big fans to ventilate the place. I was actually very pleased with the food. I remember having I think chicken cordon bleu and its probably my favorite food of the whole trip. The presentation of the dish was also pretty neat. Service was good our waiter was good.

From then on things went from good to awful in a verical line. Service was unacceptably slow. The food was very slow in coming and when it did it all the vegetables were cold. Several starters were not finished, and two main courses were sent back as being inedible. We asked to see the manager who was 'not available'. We cut the evening short, removed the most unacceptable items from the bill, left no tip and departed angry and disappointed. To add insult to injury, the prices are twice what you would expect to pay elsewhere. Not a problem if the food and service are as good as the venue, but this was not the case.

The host showed us around a little and we chose the table we wanted to sit at. This was on Sunday August 15th at 7.00 pm and it was not crowded-yet.We only ordered beer as this keeps the price down and you have control over what you are drinking. We looked over the menu and many things looked very good and this never happens but we ordered the same thing. We usually try to have variety in our meal.My husband ordered the deep fried camembert cheese for an appetizer which was to die for. It was very good. I ordered the cenote salad which was fresh greens, oil and vinagrette salad with pecans and pine nuts-awesome and refreshing. For our main we both ordered medium rare filet mignon. It was at least 12 oz if not 14. We are from cattle country and have enjoyed many great steaks-so we thought in our time. This is by far the best steaks that we have ever had in our lives-bar none. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned and I am drooling now thinking about it.My husband wanted to order a 3rd steak, but I was too full. Why ruin a good thing.We even had printed the coupon off the internet and they took 10% off. We thought the beer was priced okay for a restaurant, $40.00 pesos each so $3-3.5 each depending on exchange. The appetiziers were 90 and 70 pesos each which is about $7 and $5.5 each. The awesome steaks were 275.00 pesos which is $22.00 each. At home they would have been minimum $40.00 each. With tip we paid $86.00. Amazing. At home we could easily have seen $135.00 or more plus tip.We then toured the amazing beautifully lit caves and decided next time we would at least sit in the bar and have a drink there first and then sit at our table near the waterfall Our waiter Antonio was very good and attentive and we will be going back as soon as we can. We paid in cash, we checked our bill our food was excellent and the ambience was out of this world. Disney paid a lot of money to build a cave like this in the States.WE WILL BE BACK"

I could understand if one of us had been charged twice and the other not at all but 2 different charge cards and both charged twice -- I think they were trying to rip us off.I have had to open a dispute claim with MC while Visa immediatley refunded our friends.While the cave was interesting the food was not the best and therefore overpriced - now with this happening I wish we had bothered to go."

Worth going and taking lots of pictures...the cave restaraunt is insanely huge and beautiful, and I was told they were expanding it even more, and that's why there were places we couldn't go that were blocked off.The food, on the other hand, was absolutely horrific. I wanted to barf after trying my \"lobster bisque.\" No pieces of lobster, and a raunchy fishy taste that is probably still lingering in my mouth 8 months later now. Our appetizers were so bad that we just ordered salads because we wanted to spend as little money as possible without being rude to our waiter and the staff. We got out of there for like $70 after tip and tax, and that's having one drink each. Seriously, stay away if you are just going for the food.If you want a cool experience, I'd suggest going once, but just getting drinks at the bar so you can see the cave. The drinks were good, and the place itself is spectacular, just don't eat anything there or you will absolutely regret it."

We ordered, drank and paid for our over-priced drinks and left.The caves are really cool how they are sub-divided. My experience was better at the cave in Veradero though.

Behind an unassuming door on Avenida Juarez, you'll be greeted with flowing water and a stairway lit with luminaries (candles in paper bags), leading the way down under street level. Upon entering the cavern, stalactites, stalagmites, and underground streams - all lit in colorful lights- greet you, along with tall candelabra, flames flickering in a gentle breeze. From an ambiance perspective, El Alux is romantic, fascinating, and beautiful - tinkling chandeliers and running/dripping water add to the mood. During dinner, a guitarist performed Mexican and other Latin love songs. Because of the limestone walls, sound does travel, and it's not a quiet space. A winding set of 'paths' bring you to the lounge area, found deeper in the cavern, which is prime location for night life. Lots of little tables tucked into corners, and large lounging beds too, as well as a stage and dance floor complete with laser disco ball. We wished we could drop the kids with a sitter and come back later. Friends who had dined here recommended El Alux as a must-see, but suggested we go for cocktails rather than dinner, as their impression was that the menu was pricy and the offerings average. We tried at lunchtime, but they were closed, so we went back another evening. We had a very enjoyable meal at El Alux, and recommend it as a unique stop during a trip to PDC. My husband and I and our sons (age 5&6, who are adventurous eaters and accustomed to dining in 'tablecloth' establishments) had an early dinner, around 6:30 pm. While the food was not 5-star, it was one of the better meals we had in PDC, and the service was polished and attentive. They have a pretty good wine list (remember, you're in Mexico, not France), and we ordered an Orvieto for about $40 US. If you ask for water, you'll get a bottle of Fiji (50 pesos, which is what the cab ride over cost!). We all ordered pasta dishes, which were served with 6-8 large shrimp (U15s), and real, imported Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. The bill came to about $150US, which included the bottle of wine, 2 bottles of Fiji water, four entrees, and an appetiser soup (which we suggest you avoid - the bisque had few chunks of shellfish and no cream, --the salads looked much more appetizing). We didn't feel that was overtly expensive, and we were surprised by the quality, creativity, and presentation of the food -- much better than we had expected, and we enjoyed the meal very much. We enjoyed the evening, and the boys are still talking about it, which tells me that they did too."

I emailed a couple of days early to get a reservation and got an interesting response. \"Your bed will be ready for your arrival at 8 p.m.\" I wasn't sure what I had reserved, but we went anyway. We were told we could look around after dinner and were seated at a table near a bar . We opted to drink cervesa rather than cocktails. I ordered the French onion soup- not too good...crouton and cheese were lacking, broth was thick and a bit salty. Hubby had a salad which he enjoyed- a mixture of fruits and veggies. He chose the stuffed grouper as his entree which he liked. I ordered the arracherria steak (specialty) and it was okay. A bit overdone and had some gristle and fat. Not bad, but not the best I've had for the price. We were served bread that had been heated in a microvawe for too long and had become chewy hard and inedible (unles you softened it in soup). We order Mayan coffee for dessert which was expertly prepared at tableside, but was a bit too sweet when presented. Our bill came to 92 USD before tip- not a great value for the meal itself. Before we began our tour, the guide explained that he worked for tips only (so be prepared). He seemed hurried, but did answer specific questions. The place is phenomenal in terms of design and furnishing/lighting. They do flood during a hurricane though. There was a guitarist that played American folk covers mainly; he was very good and entertaining during dinner. Remember to tip him as well. Overall the experience cost us about 150 including all tips. We are glad we went, but now that we have seen it, we would choose a different place for our next visit."

It would be a fun place to hang out if it were really busy and maybe with a group of friends or a tour, but when we went there we were the only people in there...so it was a bit weird. The other thing is that it is off of the main strip, so we had to take a cab there and then take another cab to go to town. I'm glad we saw it, but I would not go back again."

Needless to say, we felt a little out of place. There was a sign on the door that said Dinner was \"elegant wear\" the bar is casual (no kids are allowed in bar--FYI) . I was worried we would not have time to come back it was 7:00pm so we went in anyway. The hostess asked us if we had reservations for dinner. We said no, but asked if we could go to the bar for a drink, she said of coarse. There was very few people there for dinner and two other parties in the bar area where we were sat. We ordered a drink and asked our waitress if she would take a picture, which she did. She then told us we were welcome to look around. So we did. The place is like no other I have ever seen. I don't think they would allow a place like this in the U.S. It was really awe inspiring. I think it would be more of a national park area. My husband was even surprised and agreed it is a \"must see.\""

We visited on a Sunday evening and the photographs we have taken do not do justice to the cave. It was breathtakingly beautiful. Our waiter showed us to a table which was actually part of the cave covered in a table cloth - we ordered a bottle of champagne (Moet & Chandon $120) which by uk prices was expensive but what the heck we are on holiday. The waiter then took us on a tour of the cave which included the vip areas and a new part of the cave which he told us had only been discovered approximately 4 weeks ago. It was astounding, we have never seen such beauty in all our travels and even worth visiting if just for a drink. We then ordered steak and this was mouthwatering (my husband works in the meat industry and is quite choosey about his steak). The waiter told us that the mango flamed in brandy was included with the meal and we had the choice of staying at our table or moving to one of the VIP tables - we decided as we were settled and the entertainment was relaxing to stay were we where. I then had a liquor coffee. Our waiter was extremely attentive and nothing was too much trouble. He prepared the dessert at our table and also my coffee. The whole bill came to $180 and that included service charge. Due to the excellent of the service we did leave a little extra. By UK standards the champagne was expensive but for the quality of the food the same in England would of cost at least double. We would definately recommend this restaurant and we are so glad we took the time to visit as it was one of the highlights of our holiday."

Since it was early and Tony was not busy he took us on a tour and told us the history of the restaurant and the cave. Very impressive. Having been in caves in the midwest I was surprised that this one was not at all cold. Tony explained that was because this cave is so near the surface of the land it retains heat.

The few sentences that LP had provided made the bar/restaurant sound interesting enough to warrant a visit while we were in Playa Del Carmen.At around 5pm we jumped in a taxi with the plan of hitting the bar for a quick drink before heading out to dinner - six hours later we made it out to dinner!El Alux is most definitely stupefying - it's a real, alive cave that has been turned into an amazing bar, restaurant and series of winding passageways that lead to various VIP bars and hang-outs complete with growing stalagmites and stalactites and the coolest of uber-cool decor. Think 007. Walking down into the cave you're first greeted by hosts at the entrance and shown into either the bar or restaurant. I can't speak for the food but the cocktails were amazing. Costing around $7 US, each of the cocktails were stamped with the bars signature take on the drink, many even created purely by the bar itself and utilizing traditional Mexican ingredients. My partner and i managed to work our way through almost the entire cocktail menu with the help and recommendation of one very attentive waiter (the service here is top notch). Before leaving we tipped our waiter a tidy sum and were treated to a personal tour of the cave and all it's nooks and crannies. If you ask nicely the bar staff should be happy for you to take a wander through the VIP passageway which links the separate restaurant and bar. It's an absolutely breath-taking little walk so don't leave the bar before asking if you can make the trip.El Alux is up-market and certainly pricey in comparison to most other options available in Mexico but it's still dirt cheap considering the prices at home. If you're really pinching your pennies but enjoy a good drink and an exciting experience, splash out just this once - it will certainly be worth experiencing the location and the taste of El Alux's personalized cocktails."

As a business person, I was amazed at the size and efficiency of the staff. Our waiter was constantly keeping us serviced and at one time someone in our party dropped a bottle and it broke. Before we could even react, three staff members were on top of it and cleaned it up. Never once did I feel unsafe. I was a little annoyed that some guy hung out by the bathroom and kept offering to sell me drugs. I just had to keep telling him no each time.

Having been here several times during previous stays to Playa del Carmen, I decided to bring a large group back with me during this visit. My husband and I decided to purchase the \"all you can drink\" special and we were having a great time until about an hour into the night, one of my friends took a drink from my beer while her husband was buying her drink from the bar. OUT OF NOWHERE, bouncers snatched the drink out of my hand and dragged me by the arm to the front of the bar where they cut off my wristband and told me to leave. Really...? Because my friend had a SIP of my drink? It was all a little too dramatic. So before entering, just know that the drinks included in the \"all you can drink\" special are keg beer, bad tequila, and weak vodka drinks, and YOU CANNOT LET SOMEONE HAVE A SIP or you will be treated extremely poorly. Although we have had a lot of fun in the past, we will not be returning."

There was 8 people in our group. Very small and intimate. Much different compared to the club crawls I've done in Las Vegas. There were people from all over the world (Bahamas, Iceland, Germany, Scotland and us from Canada) in our group. Very cool to meet and party with people from all walks of life. The first club was 'Abolengo' around 10:30pm. Ivan made sure everyone had drinks in hand while we were there and he had the shots coming one after another. We were celebrating my partners birthday and Ivan happily acknowledged it. He even had the club put 'HAPPY B-DAY JORDEN' on the club tv screens. So cool!! We stayed there for 90 minutes while everyone got their buzz on and were getting to know each other. Around 12am midnight we walked across the street to 'Mandala'. At 'Mandala', Ivan ordered a bottle of vodka (domestic) for the table and ordered other drinks for those who did not want vodka. While this club was fun, the one thing most of the group and I did not like was having a table that was on the outside of the club practically on the street. After a polishing off a second bottle of vodka, we headed to the 'Blue Parrot' around 1:30am. At the 'Blue Parrot', Ivan ordered a large bottle of Smirnoff Vodka for the table which was a nice surprise and pleasant change from the domestic alcohol we were drinking. The 3rd and final club (Blue Parrot) was my favourite because people were more comfortable with each other and were able to let loose more. The music walking in wasn't my thing (rap) but there was a tiny club within the club that played techno so we stayed there until the main club switched to top 40! Ivan stayed with us the whole night and made sure we had everything and anything we wanted. It was awesome. He's knows what he's doing, knows all of the people at the clubs and knows how to keep the party going. If you want to party in Playa Del Carmen and get a feel for the clubs, do this club crawl! You will get your money's worth and definitely feel it the next day. Happy to say I can cross partying in Mexico until 5am off the bucket list. Thanks Ivan!"

Ivan was basically the king of the city who knew everyone and got us the best seatings at all clubs with unlimited Tequila all night so you know how that ended. Anything we needed Ivan was there to help us whether it was a group of girls or Congratulation banners on the TV Screens he came through. So for anyone not familiar with the party scene i would totally recommend it, cant beat the price, the service and experience."

Did a boys/girl thing as we had a big group and decided that we didn't want to see the other group.Sina was with the boys, Ivan with the girls. Ivan was great - Sina was terrible which I assume is the boss. We had been told there was a foam party, and with girls, we requested to end up there last- it makes sense for girls to end up at the foam party (since our guys didn't really care when they were going to the foam party). Sina did not allow this.They forced the girls to go to the foam party second, and after we were all dripping and wet, wanted us to go to the last bar which was pretty lame - no dance floor, just couches and no bottles. They even left the foam party without 2 girls - and the 2 other girls had to run out because they saw their party leaving. Not safe.Ivan tried to get us back into the foam party since the bride was upset, and even threatened to not get married but Sina would not allow us to do it and wanted to charge us more.Sina also did not tell us about the mandatory tips for each waiter to either the bachelors or bachelorettes. (Bachelors had to tip $75 USD, and bachelorettes had to tip minimum $40).At $80-85/person, not worth the hype for 2 bars that weren't that great, and all the drama causd by Sina. The foam party was fun though! :)"

The biggest benefit for me is that you get to go in free and have a place to sit, you feel like a VIP.

All in all a good time even when you're tired and it's hot outside, you simply forget about this and enjoy."

You get to choose your club day, and get a list of the different clubs that you may be going to. You get to have open bar throughout your trip, along with immediate admittance, and VIP seating. Be prepared with 5 USD as your overall tip for the servers who will be taking care of you for the night. The drinks were great, not premium, but honestly unless you are a super alcohol connoisseur, it will not matter. The crawl starts pretty early, so do not expect things to be jumping right off of the bat. Our guide was Dana, and she was absolutely AWESOME! My friend and I ended up not having enough pesos to equate to the 5 USD gratuity and Dana was nice enough to assist, and even made sure we had enough for a cab ride back home. The people that were in our group were all really nice, and all from England, so that was pretty cool. I would recommend this for anyone looking to party the night away, and experience different clubs all in one night!"

We were ready to have a good time. I recently came from San Diego and went out plenty in the Gaslamp District and Vegas clubs . The places we went to on this tour were gross.The first lounge was ok, but it looked like there were much nicer places nearby to hang out at. The second place was a club. Like the kind of place you went to when you were underage, because it was the only place that would let you in at 18 years old. Our tour guide told us from the beginning that he could hook us up with drugs and not to buy off the streets (probably because he gets a cut from the drug dealers he works with). People in our group saw him doing lines of coke in the bathroom. My suggestion would be to anyone over the age of 25 is to get a VIP table at CocoBongo and not go on this tour. I am requesting some of my money back. It was such a disappointment for the night of our wedding."

            "review": "Great way to experience Playa nightlife!. My boyfriend and I booked this as a way to go out in Playa, we didn't really know anything about the nightlife so we figured this was a great way. We were matched with another couple and our tour guide was Dana. Dana was great and did a great job at making our night fun. In a small group like this, your night can only be as fun as you make it. I was kind of disappointed that we ended our night at Tribeca, a very crowded bar, where you have your own \"table\" but it is nothing like the VIP experience at the other bars. Like I said, this night can only be as fun as you make it. If you're not a crazy and wild person, you can't really expect a guide to be able to transform you. I highly recommend doing this tour, but go into it with an extremely open mind and let yourself have fun. I also feel this is would've been more fun with a larger group of people.I would absolutely recommend this tour. It makes club going extremely easy and cheap! With all of your drinks included (even shots!), cover charges (which tend to be $10 per bar), and table service, you can't go wrong with this tour."

I would recommend requesting Ivan if you decide to book Playa Crawl, he made the night flow flawlessly. Definitely book playa crawl if you are looking for a fun night out for the girls or guys!"

We ended the night on the rooftop lounge of Mandala.Ivan took care of us the whole night - he made sure we were safe, together, drinks were full and we were happy. He even helped us with our bachelorette scavenger hunt, which I'm sure is embarrassing for men. Ivan was the best - super fun, great dancer, life of the party, and genuinely nice.

It was a phenomenal experience and we knew we had to return.Our January 2016 night out surpassed expectation. Even though we had a larger group of girls, we had at least one table reserved at three bars/clubs in the middle of the action. Between no waiting, no cover, reserved tables, unlimited bottles and shots....it is definitely worth it. Plus, we felt extra safe because either Ivan or one of the bar guys made sure we safely went to and from the bathroom. Very important! Bottom line: fabulous night out that I will do anytime/everytime I'm in Playa! BIG thanks to Ivan for the top night another year! Cheers,veronica"

You can purchase all of your souvenirs here, or just enjoy food and drinks or people watching. Be aware that all of the shop owners will be trying whatever they can to get you into their stores, including offering free shots of tequila, or free beers. That can work in your favor, or against you, depending on how many of those you have! You can haggle on price with nearly all of the shop owners, so you can find some really good deals. If you get a block or two off of the main row of streets, there are more shops that you can find deals in as well, but I probably wouldn't recommend getting much beyond that, as the areas start to get a little more scary in what the area looks like. I wouldn't be afraid to take children on the main drag, but definitely keep them close, as this is a super busy place."

Just good times with the drinks flowing. While you get to go to the three hottest clubs happening that night, easily the most valuable part of the package is the host, Ivan. Ivan knows the scene and has great relationships with all clubs in PDC. He has an energy level that cannot be matched by anyone and he quickly gets the party started at the first venue. These sorts of crawls are only as good as the guide who takes you. In Ivan you have someone who truly loves talking, meeting and engaging with new people. His only concern is that you have a great night and he will stop at nothing to ensure you have a great night with your friends. He is a genuine cool dude and he infects everyone with his endless energy, enthusiasm and awesome outlook on life.Ivan is the real deal and makes this package a must for any visit to PDC. Ill definitely be calling Ivan when I go back."

I would give 5 stars but we had a little trouble at one of the clubs getting service, it was very packed and took a long time to get a drink. Ivan was on it right away and did the best that he could to fix the problem. Overall had a great time!!"

He made sure that everyone felt welcome, a drink in hand, and had fun. Meeting up in Playa del Carmen is easy as the Tequila Barrel cannot be missed. From there it was a great night. All of the bars are no line no cover and they're not some dives either. All of the clubs are in the heart of Playa del Carmen. When you get in there is a private area for the group to chill, drink and dance. There are waiters who serve you all night and bring you anything that you want to drink.The value you get from this is unparalleled; 3 bars and unlimited drinks for the price you pay...it does not get better than this. Money well spent."

Our resort was close to Fifth Avenue, so we met Ivan outside a bar at a designated time and then he took us out. We were with him from 10 p.m. to 3:30 a.m., and the time went by in a blink. You can opt for bottle service or order your own drinks. We ordered our own drinks, and Ivan had the waiters bring us shots throughout the night that were really delicious. The drinks were not too strong, which was good, because you need to pace yourself for the entire night. That being said, if you have bottle service you can make your drink as strong a you want, or just order more drinks, if you really want to get lit. You can't beat the VIP service for skipping lines, great location in the clubs, and bar service. Ivan is an amazing host and a great dancer. He made sure we were all having fun the entire night. You do not always go to the same locations on the Playacrawl, I think its based upon the guide's preference as well as what is the most happening place on a given night. We started out at a lounge (Abelongo), then to a went to a dance club (La Vaquita), and then ended up at the most happening place on the row (Mandala) where we had the best time. The Playacrawl is a great value - thank you Ivan!!"

Our case was a Bachelorette party and from the moment I contacted Jorge I knew this was the right choice, he got back to me within a few hrs of my email and sent me an email detailing the easiest way to set up a booking link I could send to all my girs so they could book individually ( this was awesome for me as I did not had to take responsability of all the bookings), They picked us up in a Hummer Limo with champagne bottles waiting for us, on arrival to our first club Ivan (our awesome party guide) was there to greet us, from the second we met him we knew it was going to be an amazing night, he is a really nice guy who keep the energy going all night, he is a GREAT dancer so he kept at all going and dancing the whole night. Some of the girls had never been to Mexico and were a little scared, Ivan made us feel so safe the whole night the girls didn't even remember they were concerned, it took 2 minutes of us arriving and meeting Ivan to forget this, they know everyone in every club and everyone was so polite and the services at the clubs were top notch, we made no lines had our tables waiting for us with bottle services, the waiters did not let us a single minute without an empty hand, I was amazed with the service. On top of that, our bride got to do the Playacrawl for free taking advantage of their special and we also got bachelorette supplies for free! What else can I say about it, for he price I was amazed at the services, they went above my expectations. On the Catamaran trip again, everything went perfectly, although we were a bit hangover we had so much fun and really enjoyed it, have only good things to say about Playacrawl, keep it going guys you are the best! Thanks for the amazing services and experience!"

Upon arrival our guide Ivan was easy to spot & was waiting our arrival. Well from there, the night is history: 3 bars/clubs, 5 hours, & treated like VIP gold by both Ivan himself & all hosts, waiters/waitresses, & barstaff we encountered. Obviously he had a great relationship with these people & they paid it forward to us. Drinks & shots kept flowing all night & we avoided EVERY long line. We always had a spot to sit or stand ready to go for us & were always escorted directly to them so that way we didn't have to wait or deal with the crowds. Ivan knew exactly how to show us a good time & also keep us safe. We definitely will be doing this when we come back to Playa & will certainly will be hanging out with Ivan again.

I brought a bunch of my friends to Mexico and booked Playacrawl for 6 of us. Ivan was really exactly what I was looking for in a guide, easy-going and clear about the expectations of the night regarding him and the experience. He was there when you needed him, but he gave us space to hang out. We all loved all the places; Abolengo is a bar with fantastic service and a quirky aesthetic, TriBeCa is a loud, banging club and Blue Parrot was literally wet and wild.  We had bottle service, with some fine servers such as Ullyses. We all remarked how professional, fun and thoughtful they all were. We got tons of personal attention from the servers even though the alcohol and tip was already paid for up-front with Ivan. Really solid staff who were committed to giving guests a luxury experience in a completely open-air setting. We had bottle service and devoured a bottle of Jose Cuervo. It was definitely watered down, which we were actually glad about. It meant we could drink for longer and shots weren't too harsh, and no one got too wasted or sick. Music was perfect for the beginning of the night; TONS of late 90s and early 00's throwbacks with some new top-40. Originally the plan was to go to Mandala, which was right across the street, but Ivan remarked that the club was dead. Change of plans; we headed down the street to TriBeCa, a loud open-air club with a second-story open platform accessible by a ladder, an open second level seating area, sunken dance floor and recessed bar. It was not unlike partying on the set of a Broadway mainstage set up to look like a loud club. I'm trying to remember the music and I seem to remember electronic and top-40, but I honestly don't remember. I was definitely having fun at this point, being brought red cups of something lemon-lime flavoured en masse. Seriously, I'm pretty sure we had like 10 of these 16 ounce cups full of Sprite-and-something (vodka? I honestly don't know) lined up before any of us had finished our first. Our DD even got into it, spending about a half-hour on the platform dancing amusingly close to but completely separate from the three other people in the raised, 10 foot x 8 foot stage. Third was Blue Parrot. The Foam Party. At this point things just kept happening that were amazing. We arrived to receive wristbands in...a cave? I remember it being a cave. It was a cave that became a club. We were escorted to a comfortable outdoor seating area where bottle service was offered again. I believe I ordered a drink I was wise not to finish. I had worn a white bikini top, and this was the moment I decided to reveal it. My boyfriend and our friends frolicked in walls of foam 6 feet tall. A capeira (dance? Match?) suddenly started in the fighting ring, which was when we noticed that there was a fighting ring. We accepted this and proceeded to dance amongst ourselves with various levels of gropiness. After failing to perform a piggyback ride for my soap-laden friend, we all decided the night had peaked righteously and decided to cut out for some tacos before the ride home.  Enjoyed some exceptionally satisfying al pastor at Don Sirloin (shouts to the Don) and a much-needed public restroom visit we were off to our snug vacation rental.  Thank you so much Ivan, Jorge and Rockstarcrawls for an incredible night."

Ivan was our guide - he has a great sense of humor & he took great care of us. Abolingo was our first stop and OH BUDDY, did we hate to leave there. But it only got better at the Blue Parrot!!! It was SOOO good there, EVERYONE in our group (12) wanted to stay there for the rest of the night....and was a night to remember....at least that's what SOME people said!!!"

The clubs they chose were super fun -- we felt like we were re-living our 20s when we ended up at a beachfront foam party for our final stop. We were out until 5am, and we had a great time. You are paying for convenience and a guaranteed amazing experience... and it is TOTALLY worth it. If you want a fun, boozy, no-stress way to party in Playa del Carmen - this is for you."

To start out, we were having trouble trying to pay through paypal but were given the option to pay in cash, the night of the crawl, which was very accommodating. Our party guide was Ivan-- he is awesome! He got the crowd hyped up and ready to party, we always felt safe and he provided an environment that was conducive to PARTYING! It was very inexpensive, fast (we breezed through long lines to get in and waiting at the bar for drinks) and definitely worth it.

We had a female tour guide who was really nice but she didn't keep the party going ... it all fell flat after the Bachelorette Party girls all left after the 2nd club which was a shame as they kept us amused with their falling over and slurry conversations.

Originally the boys in the wedding party had discovered PlayaCrawl online and the girls were very disappointed that we hadn't found it first. We contacted Jorge at PlayaCrawl to see if there was any way the girls could have a separate Pub Crawl so that we didn't run into the boys. Jorge didn't hesitate and set up our own pub crawl at different bars in order for us to avoid the boys and keep the bride and groom apart. This exceeded our expectations. We had VIP treatment every where we went and had a drink in our hand at all times.

So I'll start by saying that I went on FIVE Playacrawls in 8 nights that I was in Playa, and it was the best choice I made for the entire trip.So where do I even start with Playacrawl? I guess with the life of the party... My boy Ivan! The Playacrawl hits some great bars and clubs, but honestly Ivan makes the experience what it is. Everywhere that we went we were treated like regulars and had absolutely ZERO issues getting in or with any unruly people at the clubs. Throughout our various crawls, my two buddies from college and I were mixed in with couples, to bachelorette parties, to guys just rolling solo. Ivan got everybody mixing it up and kept the party going into the wee hours of the morning.The club line ups are fantastic. Kartabar is an awesome starting spot for everybody to take a few shots together and get to know one another. Typically the clubs that follow will be a mix of Mandala, Blue Parrot, Palazzo, or La Vaquita. My personal favorite was Palazzo, followed by Mandala, & La Vaquita (I didn't go on a crawl that went to Blue Parrot).The clubs here are very house music heavy and are definitely crazy loud. My recommendation is that when you are getting ready to head to Tequila Barrel and meet up with the group, just leave your inhibitions & hesitancy at the hotel. Embrace the fun, dance, make a fool of yourself, and just soak the experience in and you'll walk away having some of the best nights out you can hardly remember.Having gone out this last weekend with the same guys from the trip, we were all sitting there in Scottsdale, AZ saying \"Damn, we miss Playa and running around partying with Ivan!\" and trust me if you take the advice I gave above you will be having the same withdrawls when you leave.I can't recommend PlayaCrawl and Ivan enough. My friends and I are already in the process of booking another trip here in March and we will likely go on 6 crawls in 9 nights next time so we can get more time out at these awesome clubs mixing it up with the international crowd in Playa.Huge thank you Ivan & PlayaCrawl. We will be seeing you again soon.-Jayson, Erik, & Kevin"

We went to Palazzo and the Blue Parrot and one other bar I can't remember (surprise, surprise!). But all of the locations were amazing. We had VIP treatment and always had the best VIP areas at all of the bars. Our guide was Ivan and he was a blast! He did a great job of getting everyone organized, always made sure we were engaged and had a full drink, and kept us all together all night. Highly recommend this for anyone looking to have a great night out in Playa Del Carmen. Our girls went out as well, we requested to not meet up with them during the night and we never did. Jorge was their guide, and they had nothing but good things to say."

Someone in ur group being a debbidowner that day, dont worry and call playacrawl and ask for Ivan. Ivan got all of us in the party mood in the first ten minutes. We were all smiles after that. Had a great time, skipped club lines, and always had table reserved as promised.75 dollars per person is the best deal to go out and party at playa. Just do the math. All clubs have a 10 dllr cover charge if you dont buy thier all drinks included price. 8 dllrs a drink or 5 per beer quickly add up if bar hopping. Ivan took us to the best night clubs without having to worry about the tab or getting our next drink.If ur lucky kartabar ,a hookah bar ,is on the plan for that night and Ana gets to be ur waitress. The host thier also ensured we were having a great time.Defintely reserve this crawl for more than one night if u r planning to club. Safest and most fun you will have."

No one besides me really knew what to expect, but everyone had a great time and was extremely impressed by the nightlife. Our guide, Ivan, met us promptly at our designated meeting spot and got everyone amped up for the night. Our clubs for the night were Karta Bar, Mandala and Palazzo. We had 2 of the best tables in the house at Karta and Mandala, but Palazzo was packed by the time we arrived, so we chose to go to a less crowded location where we could get some good real estate. Ivan was cool with our request and had no problem accommodating our needs!I also did this same trip Memorial Day Weekend with a group of 13 guys for a Bachelor Party. We went to the same 3 bars on a Thursday night and had hands down the best tables at all 3 clubs. That night we got the balcony overlooking the dance floor at Palazzo which was awesome.I highly recommend doing the crawl at least one night during your stay in Playa. The guides are great, and it is nice having everything besides a little tip money prepaid and taken care of ahead of time!"

Then we went to Mandala across the street. The top floor was colored with ambient red lighting, and you could look off in the street. Then we went to Palazzo which I remember being very large and entertaining. To be honest if I could remember more details it was probably not a good party."

So my wedding was in the Mayan Rivieria just this past week, and I wanted to show my party animal friends from Toronto a good time during their trip. We frequent Toronto clubs quite a lot, partied in Vegas, Miami.... but I can honestly say, this may have been the best night for most of us so far. We had a group of 36 people aged 25-37 go out on a Sunday night in Playa Del Carmen. Transportation picked us up from Barcelo promptly, and dropped us off in Playa...Ivan and Grant showed us an amazing time... bottle service, 3 locations, each one only got better... took us to the right places at the right time when the party was the most happening. Hooked us up with the best tables, amazing top floor tables with the view of the whole club at Mandala... no waiters around and we needed more drinks (or water desperately at the end of the night)... these boys took care of us. They got the party started the minute we sat down... our group was sitting politely at the first bar on the comfy couches, and next thing you know, we are all jumping up and down on them. They were great sports, partied with us, but always professional. We never felt rushed, and the night just kept going on and getting better. We did not want to leave when 3 am arrived! We definitely would not have gotten the experience that we had without them. At the end of the night, they took care of us... did a head count, rounded up all the members of our large party from the club and got us home safe. It is an excellent value for all the drinks and club entrances you get... I am so so glad we ended up doing this! Thanks guys for an amazing night we will never forget."

He immediately put us at ease and made us feel welcome. Ivan did a great job of breaking the ice and keeping the conversation going. The clubs/bars we went to were great. The drinks were plentiful and while it is the job of the guide to ensure you have a good time Ivan was very respectful if you didn't want to partake in every round. The entire time we felt very safe. Thank you Ivan and playacrawl for a great night :) it was definitely worth the money and We would recommend this to anyone looking to have a good time partying!!"

I talked to them forever before we got to Mexico and we booked it all before we got there. They made a special PayPal link for our wedding group where the group could book our specific night. I think our group was 25, they had the guys and girls separate for one of the clubs and we all met up at the last two. The guys went to Katrabar to start and the ladies went to the bar beside La Vaquita to start (can't remember the name) us girls (11 girls) finished 3 bottles of vodka before going to La Vaquita so they definitely keep them coming!! We had a blast at the first club which was a little slow but about 30minutes in, it was like a flash mob of people came because it was CRAZY busy in the blink of an eye!La Vaquita they had us in a little upper booth thing which had drinks for ages! That was BY FAR the best place of the night! They had a cow mascot that we were all dancing with and they did a little cinnamon fire show drink thing that was insane!! I have never had so much fun in my life! That bar was off the hook! We finished off at Mandala which was completely packed and such a wonderful time - again VIP tratment and section - we did not wait in line ANYWHERE and they really made sure we were having a wonderful night! If I ever do another pubcrawl - I will always use Rockstarcrawls wherever I am!! AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!They made sure everyone stayed together and got back safely, they were always counting people and making sure everyone was together, great time! From the bride to the staff on the 18th - you guys gave me the best night of my life! Thank you so much for that!! Love you!!!!!!"

Before we left, we thought one night it would be cool to have a local show us around and take care of everything for us and it was a reasonable price (like $80-$90 pp). With a group of 10-14 each night, there is no other way to do it. He did an amazing job of keeping us all together and getting us to the next stop. It was like herding cats but he figured it out each night. After the first night, we decided to book Ivan for nights 2 and 3 as well. Everything was taken care of from start to finish and made sure the party kept going for all of us! We ended each night at \"Palazzo\" i think it was called, and it was packed each night but we still got in, still got a table/bottle and got to finish the night off strong.I recommend playacrawl and if you are lucky enough to get Ivan, buckle up!"

We were me and my 3 friends and we decided to book before our trip because this attraction was the most popular on TripAdvisor . They were a group of 16 persons with us and the a guid that unfortunately I can't remember her name but I know that she was German . We started our night at Kartabar , this place was very quiet but it was good because anyway it was just 10PM . When we go in the club , they were a table for us and they were unlimited drinks for all the group and all you have to do is ask the waiter whatever you want and we smoke some shisha included too . Please guys/girl , dont drink too much at the first bar because you have to remember that the night its only starting and you still have 2 clubs to do . I will explain later why I said that .A 1h30 later , we switched to the club Mandela where everything began , we had the highest booth and the view was incredible , that place was still open bar but this time all kind of bottles was on the table and they were a private waiter for the group and you can ask me everything you want and it is gonna make it . The kind of music played over there its trance , edm , techno . and we really enjoyed it . And to finish at 1h30 we swtiched at the club Palazzo , and since that was the last bar for the night this is where we enjoyed the most because we use to drink alot . You remember that 16 peoples before , well nobody of their group show up because they were too drunk since they drink way too much the first bar . The guide has to take care of them and she did a really good job because she was taking care of us at the same time to make sure we have everything we wanted . The guide leave a 3am but she is telling you that if you want to stay its up to you and we stayed until 5h00am . The price was only 69$ US and it include all the club above and unlimited drink everywhere you go and you skip the line-up too . To compare , this is not my first time in playa del carmen and every club have a cover free of 40US if you book them separately . I HIGHLY recommand that attraction and I will do it again when I get back . Thank you PlayacrawlNous somme habituer a de tr\u00e8s gros party et de gros festival mais je dois avouer que cette soir\u00e9e \u00e9tait incroyable . Pour commencer nous \u00e9tions une groupe de 4 amis et nous avons d\u00e9cider de r\u00e9server pour le Playacrawl vu la popularit\u00e9 de cette activit\u00e9 sur Tripadvisor . Nous \u00e9tions notre groupe de 4 personnes et un autre groupe de 16 personnes qui nous accompagnais et malheureusement je ne peux me rapeller du nom de notre guide mais je sais quelle \u00e9tait Allemande . Nous avons commencer la soir\u00e9e au Kartabar , l'endroit \u00e9tait plus tranquille mais vu qu'il \u00e9tait juste 10 heures c'\u00e9tait parfait . A l'arriver nous avions une table r\u00e9server pour nous ainsi que les drinks a volont\u00e9 fourni sur la table plus nous avons fumer du Shisha qui \u00e9tait compris. Le service \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s rapide et notre guide s'assurait que nous avions un drink toujours plein . SVP , veuillez ne pas boire comme des fous le premier bar parce que je vais expliquer plus loin ce qui c'est pass\u00e9 avec les 16 autres personnes de notre groupe . Ensuite nous nous somme diriger vers le Mandela la ou la soir\u00e9e a toute commencer , nous avions la table la plus sur\u00e9lever du bar et notre vu \u00e9tait incroyable , le formule toutes inclus fournissant directement les bouteille sur la table et il avait un serveur juste pour nous . Le genre de musique jouer , Trance , edm . Ensuite nous nous somme diriger vers le Palazzo et vu que c'\u00e9tait le dernier bar c'est la que nous avons le plus profiter de notre soir\u00e9e car nous avons bu comme des fous . Nous \u00e9tions rendu juste 4 parce que les 16 autres avait tellement trop bu le premier bar qu'il \u00e9tait trop chaud donc il on du partir . Le guide \u00e9tait avec eux pour s'assurer que toute \u00e9tait correct et s'occupait de nous en m\u00eame temps pour nous faire vivre une des plus belle soir\u00e9e de notre vie . Nous somme partit du Palazzo a 5 heures du matin et je vous jure que cette activit\u00e9 est incroyable vous devez le faire . Pour le modique co\u00fbt de 69 $ que nous avons payer vous avez acces au trois bar nomm\u00e9 plus haut ainsi que la formule toutes inclus toute la soir\u00e9e et vous skiper le line up . A titre de comparatif chaque bar reserver individuellement est de 40 US . Je vous le recommende au plus haut point c'\u00e9tait toutes qu'une soir\u00e9e et nous allons le refaire sa c'est sure . Merci le PlayaCrawl"

The nite began at the Tequilla Barrel Bar where we met our Guide for the nite Miguel, he was punctual and greeted us with a smile and ready to go. We were the only ones signed up that nite so he was like our own private club guide. We began the nite at the first club with some shots and any drink we wanted at our table right on the street where we could see everything, we then headed to our 2nd club where we walked right in and to our private table with shots waiting for us. Miguel knows everyone on the street and in the clubs, felt very comfortable walking around with him all nite with my daughter and her friend and my wife. It was my birthday and Miguel arranged special flaming tower drinks at 2 of the clubs for me, it was really cool. We then headed to our 3rd club and once again walked right in to a waiting table and drinks in hand. We ended our nite a little early at 2:30 with smiles on our faces and a new friend made. We will definately book again and ask for Miguel next time we come to Playa and be ready for a Great Time out."

One thing I can say is that the reviews are true, it's a great night out especially if your guide is Ivan! He's the best! We originally booked our night out for a Wednesday, and due to some unforeseen circumstances due to weather our night out wasn't the best. On the following day we received an email from George from Playacrawl inviting us back out to try another night on them, we immediately took them up on the offer. The second time around Ivan was our guide and we were so happy that we came back out. We simply had a blast! We were in a group of five people and we all had a great time. We danced, we drank, and we all bonded. Ivan got the party started by giving us a few round of shots, and let's just say not to long after that everyone was up and dancing. It was our last night in town and we figured we would go out with a bang, and we definitely did! We were so grateful that Playacrawl had amazing customer services and invited us back out. That was definitely something were not expecting, but very happy that it happened. Hands down we would come back and go to Playacrawl again and request Ivan. Tip: Make sure you request Ivan to be your guide. You won't regret it. He's awesome!"

Despite being tired from a really long flight and our resort being located about half hr away from Playa del Carmen, we decided to venture out on our first night. Unfortunately we were running late but given that we knew the schedule instead of going to the meeting point we went to the first bar \"Kartabar\", there we found Ivan who directed us to sit and wait for our guide. Minutes later Sina got there, from the get go we knew we were going to have a good time. She quickly got us the first round of drinks and within minutes we had our first shot of Tequila. Since Ivan was hosting a Bachelorette party, we had the option of going with them or picking another place. We went with Sina to check out Blue Parrot but decided we wanted to stick with Mandala. We then headed there and let me tell you, I THOUGHT I partied hard but Sina and Ivan WOW, they made the night SO much fun, all I remember was drinking, laughing, tequila shot, dancing, and so on. After an hr or so in Mandala we headed to Palazzo, mind you I was already ##$%^4#@ UP! but the drinks kept on coming and we couldn't say no. Needless to say, we had to end our night early or so we think because we drank so much we blacked out and only remember waking up in our hotel at 10:15am, late for an excursion we had to miss because we were so hung-over... PlayaCrawl was worth it though! Best thing is we got to the hotel safe and nothing was missing, I'm sure Sina took good care of us. If you're reading this Sina, you're the best!!! You too Ivan!!! I'm not sure if we thanked you but thanks for the best night ever, we really had TOO much fun and can't wait to be back in PlayaCar to do it all over again!"

After a long day on the beach, drinks, and getting stuffed at dinner, we didn't know if we would catch our second breath for the night ahead. We were wrong. We met Ivan (a.k.a. Tiger Woods) and knew instantly that the night would be ours. We started at Kartabar, then moved to Mandala, and ended the night at Palazzo. There are way too many advantages to doing a PlayaCrawl with Ivan to name. Particularly if you are new to the area, you want to save money (so many drinks), you don't want to deal with the hassle of getting a constant flow of drinks, etc you will love this. I plan on visiting again and will definitely do this again. My $70 has never been put to better use on a night out."

We started off in a mellow hookah bar where we got a chance to get to know everyone and then went to two other clubs. It was a busy night down town and we were escorted past the lines to reserved prime tables everywhere we went. Ivan made sure our glasses were never empty plus kept the shots coming all night long. While we were probably the oldest folks in the crowd, we felt comfortable and had a GREAT time. Will definitely do it again next time here. It was definitely worth the money.

He had such good vibes, we were already at ease from the start.. He made sure we were having a good time and even kept us entertain w/ his moves.. we called him the mexican Chris Brown.. The two ladies joined us eventually at Kartabar.. more drinks and shots wich was all included, then headed to the next spot, Mandala.. it was a good transition from Kartabar, since its not as loud as Mandala so we were able to get acquainted first.. Mandala was a really nice open club w/ 2 floors and a sky bar, had the music blasting and just drew people in.. there was a line out but of course we got in right away VIP in the sky bar.. and really, that's all I could remember.. lets say me and my friends night ended a little earlier.. with me in the bathroom for half an hour and Ivan trying to get in the ladies room to help me and my friend out but of course they wouldnt let him.. when I finally got some strength to get up w/ help from my friend, Ivan was right outside.. He helped us to the taxi and told the driver where our hotel was.. Good thing my friend Missy was not completely intoxicated.. But Ivan took care of us til the end.. and even came out with us the next day.. I kept saying I didn't even get to dance and when I saw the pictures later.. there was me on the dance floor hahaha.. Epic.. so don't forget your cameras for the moments you might not remember.. When we come back to PDC, we will definitely do this again and strongly recommend this to all and ask for Ivan.. we didn't just meet a host.. we made a friend.."

First the meeting location (Tequila Barrel Bar) was MUCH easier to find and was legit. I felt much more comfortable arriving there than the around the corner behind, the palm tree all the way upstairs location rom 2012. lol Our guide this year was Ivan and he is so much fun! He's funny, an awesome dancer and full of energy. We had a small group of just 4 people so I was concerned that maybe having such a small group wouldn't be as much fun since clubbing usually follows the \"more the merrier\" template but I was far from disappointed. Ivan kept our glasses full, had me and my hubby on the dance floor, laughing and having nonstop fun the entire night and trust me for my husband to do more than hold up walls during a night on the town is quite a feat. All in all this was a blast and I'd do it again a 3rd, 4th & 20th time. Totally worth it. Ask for Ivan...you won't regret it!"

Jorge and Ivan really take care of us from the moment we arrived in out Hummer limo to the last minute of the night were they walked back to out limo, they are complete gentlemen and really know everyone at all the clubs we went to, we felt 100% safe and the party was non stop all night long.

As the MOA I wanted us to do something fun and came across PlayaCrawl. Jorge was fantastic from the very beginning when I contacted him. He was also very helpful and accommodating with transportation to and from the hotel. Once we arrived at the first location, which was a Middle Eastern lounge Jorge was waiting to greet us. This venue was perfect to start out the night. From there we were taken to two different clubs, which were easily comparable to NYC/Chicago/Vegas clubs and had a blast at each of them. We had a table and bottle service at venue. One of our girls does not drink hard liquor.. .beer is her drink of choice and she was given her own pitchers. Our guides were fun and entertaining :) Most importantly they made everyone feel safe. Our bachelorette had soooo much fun that she does not remember some parts of the night so I recommend you take lots of photos ;) I highly recommend PlayaCrawl."

Really enjoyed the night, love the Playa nightlife, which is more laid back than Cancun, but still lots of tequila!We ended the night more than tipsy and very hungry, Pepe was kind enough to take us to a local taco shop where we got our late night taco fix.

We felt like true VIPs with not only our own private area but the best location at every single bar. I was quite concerned about safety but never had to worry with Miguel and Jorge around.

They provide an unbeatable service that is absolutely worth it (and then some...)I actually worked with Playacrawl to arrange 2 nights for a bachelorette party. All of the girls in my group were visiting Playa for the first time, so we knew we needed to go to Coco Bongo one night, but we were up in the air about what to do the second night. After doing my research I found Playacrawl and thought it would PERFECT for the girls. I reached out via their website and Jorge replied back very promptly with details, etc. After cruising around their website I then realized that they could also arrange to purchase the tickets at Coco Bongo. So I figured... why not arrange both nights through Playacrawl.For our first night (a Wednesday), we were headed to Coco Bongo. As a group of girls we were late, but we didn't think it was a huge deal as we were chose to do the regular open bar entrance (not VIP) and we were only expecting to pick up our tickets at Will Call. Little did we know that Jorge actually set up a host for us to walk us in (VIP status) and set up a table for us in the most clutch location within the bar. We felt like rock stars getting ushered in while others were standing and waiting in line. We spent the night dancing on the bar, amazed at the spectacular show that was taking place in front of us. Amazing night!For our second night (a Saturday), we were doing the official Playa Crawl bar crawl around Playa. Our driver Eddie picked us up promptly from our resort and he shuttled us over to meet with Chris at KARTABAR. We started there with a couple drinks and shots to get warmed up, and after we made a couple of requests with the DJ, Jorge arrived to whisk us off to MANDALA across the street. At Mandala we went straight to the rooftop where a table and drinks were waiting for us. We danced and drank the night away. Great music and great company since Jorge also had a couple more of his hosts join the party. The night didn't end there of course, and we ended up going to yet another amazing club filled with chandeliers -- Palazzo. There too, a couple more of the hosts joined us in partying at our elevated table. All in all we went to three amazing clubs all with different vibes, and all delivering a different (and fitting) experience. We left the last venue some time around 2am (on our own accord since we were all partied out at that point), and were safely provided a ride home to the resort. Suffice to say... the night was a huge success. All in all we had the time of our lives in Playa thanks to Playacrawl. If/when I return to Playa I will definitely hire these guys again -- whether with a large or small group. For the price and the experience it is WELL WORTH IT."

There was a soccer game on TV in the downstairs part, but when we told the waitress we were with Playacrawl, she took us upstairs. I'm pretty sure we opened the place. No one else was there. We were also the only ones with playacrawl. The drinks we very basic and limited (rum and coke). The DJ started playing stuff, but with no one else around, we just chatted with our host and left after an hour.Next we went to another place that was busy and music going. I thought this was going to start the night. Our host couldn't get us in. I started thinking I had really wasted my money. So we went to an alternate place, I think it was Palazzio or something like that. Again, we opened the place at 10:30. No one was there. We got a seat and they started the lights and music. After about 15 minutes others started coming in. The drinks here were much better, but still I thought not anywhere worth the $85/person. Our guide was real attentive and tried to entertain us and kept the drink flowing.We left about an hour later and went to Coco Bongo. Wow, what an incredible experience. I will write a separate review there. Our original host couldn't go into Coco Bongo without paying full price for himself, but he handed us off to another Playacrawl host inside. We got a reserved table, which was very important. Drinks, water and fun just came non-stop the rest of the night. This was looking at a one star review, before CB.I came to understand that Tuesday is the only Coco Bongo night for Playacrawl. This may be why some of the other places were more subdued. It certainly made up for it. I could have really done without the other two places and just gone to CB.In the end, the hosts were great and we had a blast for a very good price."

The first club always seems to be Ula Gula on 10th and 5th Ave. We got strapped and the drinks and shots started flowing. The music is good (deep house vibe) and the atmosphere is laid back. We styed there until 11:30 then we walked over to Mandala, our favorite club. We walked by the line and went up a few stairs to the VIP area with couches, tables and plenty of room to dance. The waitresses took great care of the group. Again lots of drinks and shots. We left Mandala around 1:30 and walked to Palazzo and again we walked right by the line and we were led to the VIP area next to the stage. We had a couch, tables and our drinks were already waiting for us when we got to the table. We danced for a while, but we had more fun at Mandala so we tipped Miguel said good night and we went back to Mandala and finished the night there. I was tipping our servers at each location and the service staff at mandala recognized us so we continued to drink for free. (I tipped servers and shot girls 100 peso notes which is about $8.00) We went back to Mandala 4 times over the next 12 days and were always very well taken care of.

We can honestly say it was the Highlight of our trip. Our guide was Christian, he was extremely awesome and he took great care of us! He kept the group dancing and made sure everyone was having fun. I loved his down to earth, fun personality. I've never met anyone who has so much energy as he does! He definitely seems like he loves his job and we enjoyed him so much! We met up with him at a bar/lounge at first where we met with another couple from a different resort (I forgot the name of the bar) then he brought us to Mandala and Palazzo (the hottest nightclubs!!) We had over the top VIP treatment everywhere we went (no cover, free drinks, no lines). We all had laughter and had the best time of our lives dancing the night away! I would recommend coming here if you're looking to party and have a great time with great people in a GREAT atmosphere! I definitely want to return and party like a rock$tar with Christian again. He's so much fun! :-) It was an amazing experience we would never forget. Until next time!!"

Made it to meet everyone at Ula Gula and what a blast. Sina was our excellent tour guide. It was just amazing and if there's only one thing you do on vacation in Playa it is the crawl. Our group was small but fun. Off to Mandala after that OMG a sea of bodies but we had a private entrance and special reserved seats and private service. Amazing and I had a terrfic time. I will never forget it. Sina thanks to you. Jorge so special to meet you. Christian - incredible thank you. You have to try this folks you will never ever forget it."

I highly recommend booking an outing with playacrawl. hands down the best time ever. in playa del Carmen its hard to find out whats the best place and also waiting in the line and also the line at the bars are the worst lots of waiting. We had Miguel as our guide and he was the best he was there right when we got out of our taxi and took us to our first hookah bar/club. Playacrawl also arranged other bachelorette party activities, just ask them they know all the hook ups and people in the area. We went to three different clubs and my favorite one was the club right off the beach and there was a long line and we cut and go in with no problem. Also whenever we need a drink Miguel was constantly taking care of us and making orders for us so we could actually enjoy our group and just focusing on having fun. Miguel definitely got our whole group dancing and having fun, he definitely knows how to make sure that everyone has fun. He was my official dance partner for the night and was awesome had the best time. I have been to mexico several times but this experience only elevated it and made it the best hands down. Also the other men at playacrawl are eye candy, ladies you will be in good hands ;)-michele"

Booking with Jorge was no problem and he took the time to answer any questions...I only wish I had taken his advise and took more pictures to remember more of the night! :)Our guide, Miguel, was fantastic - he was attentive and accommodating...and an absolute blast to party with! He quickly got our group introduced and we all became fast friends. From there he always made sure we had a drink in hand and no one was on the sidelines. We also had Jorge and Christian with us too on this night and if you get to go out with any of these 3 guys I assure you that you're in for a great night...period!We would do this again in a heartbeat! The truth is that I wasn't expecting this night to be all that it was simply because it was $70. This included any entry fees, no line ups, bottle service at 2/3 bars and a kick-butt party. We expected fun but this was WAY better than we thought, and to us, the night was priceless. We probably would have considered booking a 2nd time if there was more time!When Playacrawl says you'll be taken care of, you are. Not only is the service from the Playacrawl guys great but all the bar staff also were outstanding - it's obvious they are well connected.So if you're making your way to Playa and looking for an awesome night out - do this, you won't regret it!"

            "review": "Solo traveler: A BLAST!. even if you THINK you don't like bar crawls, you will love PlayaCrawl. Each tour each night is tailored to customers. Thus, if the guide sees an older crowd, he will opt for the chill beach bars in Playa over the loud dance clubs. Our group last Saturday night, however, was of energetic partiers, so we headed to Kartabar, Mandala, Palazzo, and even a 4th club bonus (La Santanera). As the website duly advertises, the tour includes VIP wristbands and TRULY no wait in line for, open bar for 5 hours, visit at least 3 clubs (you spend about 1 hr, 20 min. at each), and bottle service in at least 2 of those venues. The best part? The one bar we didn't get bottle service at, we got 3 rounds of SHOTS, in addition to the 2-3 rounds of individual drinks we have time to order! Oh, and we even got to enjoy a belly dancer show! (this was at Kartabar btw)Considering how any given club charges (on average) US $45 for open bar (not including VIP treatment!), PlayaCrawl is a BARGAIN. It is not your fake Cancun VIP tour, in which the VIP line sometimes is longer than the regular line. Here, our group was passed to the very front as soon as we got to the entrance of each venue, were placed in a VIP seating area or booth, had our own dedicated waiters, and cups/bottles were never empty. I loved how we didn't feel rushed at all. We truly got to experience each and every venue; had a great taste of Playa Del Carmen nightlife. Given to the fact that venue selection changes every night and possibly every week, I can't wait to do it all over again when I go back to Playa Del Carmen! Thanks Jorge and Pepe! Had a blast! :D"

Pepe went out of his way to make sure his group of \"crawlers\" had drinks in hand and he never runs out of stories!!

After that we went to some awesome Hooka bar that is right across the street from Mandala, both were awesome. The Playacrawl people were awesome, ordered hookah and kept bringing some blue shots that gave me a hangover the next day. HahaI'm only giving it 4 stars just because when it's a big group, sometimes it's hard to coordinate, and if you are ready to go to the next place you have to wait for others, but it's just me, I like to dance to the beat of my own drum.

Our initial guide was Jorge who took us to our first stop. We then met up with Miguel, another PLayacrawl guide, who took us and about 10 other people on the actual Playacrawl The music was awesome there, We did have bottle service at all three clubs but my favorite by far was Mandala.

Believe me, I;m from Mexico and I was some kind of skeptical about pay for something that in theory you can do by yourself, but no doubt would take you 2-3 days to realize about the different options and most of us don't have that time (tight agendas and tours already arranged).In our case we had an awesome experience with Playacrawl, our hoster Pepe was right on time at the first place, which was just a nice bar but the intention of this place is to warm up and break the ice among the group, 45 minutes later we moved to Mandala !!!! Totally packed and we got a nice area, table and view inside the place. I'm a beer guy but this time decided to get some Vodka and mix with 3 options of fruits ... great drinks !!!!! they opened the bottles in front of us and also served but you can pour more for a stronger drink in case you want to... We went high on this place and couldn;t believe when the guy said \"time to move on\", we then move to \"Pallazo\" ...waooo !!! bigger place and totally full !!!! climax !!!! more vodka, tequila shots, fancy drinks , etc... At this point Jorge (one of the Playacrawl owners) joined us, nice dude !!! even the tour finish by 3 am, places are open until 6 am, you go from there by your own but at least in our case they stayed with us until almost 4:30 and we stopped just because I had to drive so just want to keep having fun but not overhammered by the alcohol and mess the great time we were having, so if you are a party guy and want to see the sun, then its a good idea to book a cheap room at Playa del Carmen downtown (actually we found a hotel 4 blocks from the discos area right in front of the city hall for 500 pesos !!!! ) ..

If you really are up to having fun and don't want to be worrying about anything you definitely should do the Playacrawl. The price is unbeatable, I mean 65 dlls to drink all night and cover charges included + all the fun, I would of payed 100 dlls and still would of thought it was a great deal.

The drinks are as strong as you make it because it is bottle service but with the heat and dancing you sweat out and work off the alcohol so keeping buzzed was a real effort. I went on a pub crawl in Ireland and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Perhaps if they added some of those elements like special shots that you can only get locally, quick fun facts about the clubs we were going to. I don't really know but some tweaking of the format would appeal to me but who knows everyone else seems thrilled with just plain drinking and dancing.I wish we got to have more fun with the staff like all the other reviews said. They were nice and professional but fun... meh wouldn't say that much. The people in my group were awful, and they were eventually kicked out but not before they grabbed my behind repeatedly (one of them was so drunk he couldn't keep his eyes open, spilled alcohol everywhere, and seemed like he would throw up on someone). This guy was very clearly over the line intoxicated at the first club once he arrived but he was allowed to stay until he was practically unmanageable. I wouldn't do it again."

I must say, when we first booked this I was not sure it was the best Idea since we were a group of 10, I mean 10 persons at 65 bucks each is 650 bucks for one night, so we were not sure if it was worthy or not. Boy was I ever wrong, We partied like there was no tomorrow, non stop drinks, VIP treatment, No lines, our own tables, we could not have asked for more. I dont have anything bad to say about this pub crawl, It is totally worthy everyone had a blast and the group consinsted of guys that were 18 to even my dad who is almost 50, everyone really enjoyed the night. Thanks to all the Playa crawl guides for such an amazing time.Saludos desde Canada y Venezuela!"

I found Playacrawl on tripadvisor and I reluctantly took a chance with them. This was the best decision we ever made for a night out!!I don't know where to begin or even describe the event so let me say that Miguel and his crew did a very good job in taking care of us... I mean taking really, really good care of us not just in terms of drinks but also in terms of safety while we were partying and getting hammered with drinks.We started in a mellow bar to get us acquainted with the group and the other guest and believe me, the bar might had been mellow but the drinks keeps pouring in. After that, we moved into a mid-level dance club where there was a line to get into the bar and we just walked right in past the lines of people waiting to get in. Again, as advertised, its all you can drink. The third and final destination was a high end dance club where people were just lined up waiting to get into the club and once again, we just walked right in. We didn't even have to wait for more than 30 seconds.It was a fun night and everything that was advertised was more than fulfilled by Miguel and his crew!! They took real good care of us and they showed us how to party in Mexico..... I say take a chance on Playacrawl and you will not regret spending money on them!Next time my girlfriend and I will be back, we will definitely book a night or two with Playacrawl or maybe even try their Cancuncrawl!!Miguel and crew, Thank you very much for a great experience!!!"

My wife and I were in town celebrating our anniversary and wanted to get out one night to check out the nightlife. Boy did they live up to their excellent past reviews. Miguel was our guide and was a very cool guy. We had a group of 6 and couldn't have asked for a better time.........well that is if we all decided to stay out the whole night. We had a couple in the group that didn't want to stay out too late so the evening was cut a tad short. That definitely didn't stop us from the fun. We went to three places and as advertised there was a consistent flow of alcohol. All three places were packed, with our last stop being Mandala was seriously packed. Even after we left Miguel took us to a spot to eat which was also good. Miguel also offered to get my wife and I into Coco Bongos the next night using his discounted rate which was cool. We would have definitely taken him up on his offer if we weren't too hung over from the night before. All in all, we had a blast and would have done it again on the trip if we had extra time. Would definitley recommend the crawl if you want to have a good nite out on the town."

Pepe was our host and lots of fun. It was a muggy night after a brief rainstorm but we ventured to two different clubs because one wasnt open due to the rain. As advertised, bottle service was provided and the shots flowed! :)Our only regret of the evening was our table was at the front entrance. Only in Mexico can you pack 1,000 club goers in a space meant for a few hundred. That said, Pepe and the others from Playacrawl go out of there way to make you feel safe, all while having a great time. We highly recommend you invest $65 and party like a rock star in Playa.

This is a great idea to do if you're not sure where to go for a night out. You meet your guides in downtown at some hostel. The entrance seemed sketchy at first but turned out to be okay. We had two guides who had great energy and rounded up our group of 20 peeps for a night on town. We went to 3 bars, each with a different ambience but they each all played the same music and had the same kind of water-down drinks. Overall a fun time though since we would not have known where to go otherwise. We figured out a few nights later though that each club were all on the same street within two blocks! But I guess when you're drunk and having a good time, they all seem to be far away. :) At each place though the guides made sure we all got drinks and got in thru security ok. Very professional and took care of us. In fact our guide helped negotiate a cheaper rate back to our hotel! Pepe and Christian were our guides and had a great time with them."

We started the night at the meeting spot the Rio Hostel. At first we thought that this was a shady little bar but we we soon pleasantly comforted by our bartender Enrique. Enrique was very friendly and poured us each a complimentary Tequila shot, as we waited for our guide Christian. After about ten minutes a man with a Playcrawl shirt appeared and we asked him if he was Christian. He said no his name was Pepe and that Christian couldn't make it so he would be our guide for the evening. Let me tell you that this is probably the best thing that could have ever happened because I think that we made a friend for life. Pepe was the nicest, kindest person that we had met while in Mexico, and that says a lot as everyone we met was very nice. Pepe brought us to three clubs from the first bar. At each bar we skipped the lines, did not have to pay any additional cover charges, and had unlimited drinks made for us right at our private tables. They truly went out of their way to make us feel special. Pepe took care of everything for us making sure that we were safe and having a good time. At one point in the night my wife's feet were hurting her from her heels so Pepe said hold on I'll be right back. He was gone for about ten minutes and the next thing you know he returned with a brand new pair of sandals that he ran down to the store and paid for out his own pocket. Pepe was so good to us that we had made a special request that he bring us to CoCo Bongo on another night of our trip. He was happy to do this for us even though Playcrawl did not normally bring guests to CoCo Bongo. Again Pepe had set everything up for us and made sure that we were taken care of like movie stars. Pepe treated us not like clients but like family. Hands down the best $65 I have ever spent in my life, and I cant wait to go back next year."

We had a variety of ages in the group, and the guys from the Playacrawl team catered for all of us and ensured that we all had a lot of fun and enjoyed the evening. They took us to 3 different bars/clubs around the Playa Del Carmen area, just off the main drag of 5th Avenue, meaning we saw a better side to the area. We had VIP areas, reserved tables and waiter service in each place, and were so well looked after \u2013 our drinks were constantly topped up, and never once did anyone feel uncomfortable. They also made sure we all stayed together all night, but didn\u2019t stop us having fun and partying around the clubs!The one piece of advice I\u2019d give for UK travellers giving Playacrawl a go is don\u2019t be put off by the appearance of the first bar \u2013 Geisha bar. It\u2019s a roof top bar with a lovely little swimming pool and a great place to first meet your guide, but from the outside you need to go up some pretty sketchy stairs which say it\u2019s leading you up to a hostel. I promise it\u2019s not as bad as it looks (some of the girls in my party were a little unsure at first).If you\u2019re looking for a great night out in Playa Del Carmen, and like the VIP treatment, I\u2019d definitely recommend booking with Playacrawl \u2013 great value for money! Thanks to Pepe and Jorge for giving us a great night."

There were 12 of us who went out. My friend arranged everything before hand from home but she said Jorge was great at returning emails and had the payment link set up right away. It's perfect because everyone can use the Paypal link to pay for themselves and no one person is stuck covering the costs for the others. We went out on a Monday night and our transportation was right on time from our resort. We met our guide, Chris, right on 5th avenue. Chris is probably one of the most entertaining, fun, great people I have met. He is so outgoing and he can seriously party! He made us all feel so comfortable right away and had us out on the dance floor first thing. It was a slower night in Playa so we went to two bars but we had the greatest time. The drinks were unlimited and STRONG. We had our own VIP sections and Chris even had some creepy guys removed from the bar who were trying to hang out with us. This is truly the best value for your money. I asked in the bars and one drink is $11 USD and cover is $20. This makes the $65 for VIP, no line, no cover and unlimited alcohol so worth it.Safety is the first priority for this company. Chris made sure we were all together and even showed us to the washrooms. One of the girls in our group wasn't feeling well and since we have a \"leave together\" rule, around 1:30 we decided we were ready to go. Chris and Jorge texted the driver and he was there within 15 minutes to take us home. Trust me when I say that if you book Playacrawl for a bar night out, you will not be disappointed!"

Our party started on the roof of the local youth hostel and our guide, who seemed quite animated and energetic started us with a round of drinks, then shots and a beer bong for a couple of people in the group (a bachelorette party). Next was a corner club that looked more like a restaurant, open on 2 sides to the street with loud music and lights. They did give us a round of drinks but the 9 or 10 rounds of shots they kept bringing were pure sugary liquid and no alcohol. We did not have any \"bottle service\" that's promised on their website.The second club was larger, and a real club atmosphere with a DJ. When I asked for vodka, they kept pouring me tequila. Again, no \"bottle service\" until I complained to the guide then a bottle of vodka arrived at the table, but soon it was time to go. The guide was having a really good time dancing around and enjoying himself. One good thing, they did bring our bachelorette a special flaming drink that was quite cool.The third club he took us to was quite packed and three full floors of people, and he didn't bother to make sure we all stayed together. I spent about 45 minutes wiggling through the crowd looking for someone I knew. Many of us had had enough and eventually regrouped out in the street and went on our way. How can a dozen girls spend hours in a club drinking and noone got drunk???"

Jorge, the boss man, provided outstanding customer service with prompt responses to my emails and going above and beyond by providing nightlife suggestions for the other nights we were in town. I was even more impressed and so appreciative when Jorge happily accommodated our very very last minute/night-of request to push our meet time by 45 minutes due to an unexpected conflict. As for the meet-up spot, it is quite shady but don\u2019t be alarmed as the drop-dead gorgeous Playacrawl guides otherwise known as Professional Partiers are awaiting you with open arms and tequila shots. Upon arrival, we fell in love with our incredibly energetic guide, Christian, who kept the vibe wayyy up and the shots, mixers & bottles flowing from Danzantes to Mandala and lastly to Palazzo. We were also accompanied by Miguel, who is delicious eye-candy and an amazing dance partner. Believe the hype \u2013 no lines, no cover, reserved tables, unlimited drinks and bottle service at 3 places for only $65.00 -- unheard of in NYC or anywhere, really. In any case, my girls and I love to dance (especially on tables and chairs), and that\u2019s exactly what we did up until 4am - right alongside our guides. All in all, we had a ridiculous time.As the night went on, our group of twelve women dwindled down as some of us separated to head back to our resort and Christian, our chivalrous leader, ensured our safety by escorting each of our separate groups from the club to the taxi.After Playacrawl spoiled us on our second night with VIP everything, on our third night in Playa Del Carmen, table service was a necessity. We decided to go back to Mandala, our favorite of the three Playacrawl stops. Before heading out, Jorge & I exchanged a couple of emails in which he mentioned that he and Christian would be at Mandala as well. Our tables happened to be right next to one another and well \u2013 enough said\u2026 another night that went down in history =DSo, if you love to drink, dance and party VIP style, then you NEED to buy these tickets. Thank you, Jorge, Christian & Miguel, for a night we'll never forget! XO - The 12 Girls from NYC"

If you ask the locals or even tourists most will have no idea about this company since most party hopping tours in playa stop operation but these reviews on trip advisor are true to heart just look at the dates.We went out on 3-18-2012 and Cristian and Sien (mispelled probably sorry) were our guides and they were high energy and amazing the whole time. We got amazing bottle service and attention from the waiters. We got anything we wanted in terms of mixers bottles shots. They bring around trays of shots and they are wayy more flavorful than alcoholic but its just showing u that u are getting great service. My friend and I just came from Cancun a week ago and had a VIP service from Afterdark for 7 nights and that didnt light a torch compared to the service we got from PlayaCrawl for 1 night.Now on to the club scene we had people from ages 20 to probably 40 in our group..these clubs here are for any age it absolutely doesnt matter you will all have fun. I am not one to dance and im pretty shy to begin with so let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised to find myself up on little speakers and stages dancing with women the tour guides etc. The guides on this tour WILL make sure you are having a good time and within our group there was not one person without a smile on their face moving to the music within about an hour into the tour. The clubs here charge $40 to $60 for guys (some women get in free) so to pay $65 and get into 3 of the best clubs that night AND get bottle service AND have helpful energetic guides AND not have to pay for drinks is nothing short of AMAZING...everyone around us was paying $10 a drink and the only sad thing I can say is it resulted in a bunch of sober girls around us :( (the ones outside of our group of course)"

Signing up is really easy with payment through PayPal. Great value, a lot of fun, a lot of drinks, but most of all our host, Chris was the difference maker. Full of energy and super attentive to all 14 of us from the beginning up until we left at 4am. We will definitely remember him. He even walked us to the nearest late night burger joint before he heads back to the rest of the party."

It's safe, trust me, the girls were looking at me like I was crazy when we got there but immediately relaxed when we met our guide. HE WAS CRAZY! Christian met us and he has more energy than any human being I've ever met. Perfect guide for this trip. Be ready to drink as little or as much as you want. Christian encouraged, but did not force anybody to do anything they didn't want to. We went to a little bar down in the party zone first and met up with a bachelorette party. Christian moved from group to group making sure everyone was having a good time. We then moved to a great dance club and then to the Blue Parrot to end the night. Christian got us a cab back to our hotel and we left at around 2:30 a.m. I recommend anyone that's never been to Playa that wants to cut loose one night - use these guys. The owner, Jorge, was out with us for awhile as well. He was a great guy too. Good job Playacrawl!"

We chose to go out with Playacrawl after reading great reviews. We had an absolutely great time!!!! Chris was our guide and definately took care of us. Sena is a guide also that came out with us even though she had the day off. They both made sure that we went to popular clubs and everyone was having a great time, always had a full drink and felt comfortable. These guides can definately move and made sure we were too.

Chris was our guide and he was fabulous, it was Sena's night off and she still came out and joined us. They made sure we had a good time with them and the rest of our group. They did a great job of keeping us all together, getting us into the clubs and seriously - it was VIP type service all night long! We felt extremely safe being with them. The drinks were constantly flowing and they did not scrimp on anything! I just wish Chris and Sena could teach us how to dance and move like they do!!!!

Going out with the Playacrawl crew made us feel like high rollers... bottle service, shooters, constantly topped up drinks, and no line-ups at all. Jorge and Sina are hooked up, and make sure that their guests have a great time partying in Playa. Worth the coin for sure. As we learned the hard way.... probably best not to do the playacrawl on your LAST night in town... we had an extremely long travel day the day after (ie. flight to the west coast of Canada) and were not feeling tip top after a great night out - will spare you the details! Do it when you first arrive in Playa so you get to know the great area for bars and clubs."

It is literally all you can drink, although remember they don't necessarily have the same drinks in mexico as they do in the US so you might have to explain what you want. The service was great, we didn't have to wait to get into clubs and we got to go to two really popular bars in Playa. Totally worth doing it, especially at the beginning of your trip so you can find some new cool places."

I emailed Jorge (partyinfo@playacrawl.com) at 4:30 pm THE DAY OF, and he was able to squeeze me in for THAT NIGHT. He answered my questions quickly through email, sent me the payment link, and then provided me with instructions for where to meetup. I went to the meeting place and was greeted by our guide, Sina, a fun German girl. She got me a beer, introduced me to the rest of the crowd, and let us know we'd be leaving soon. We made our way to the first bar (Danzantes) and the drinks (bottle service, shooters, and shots) just started coming. I was the first one to bust out the dancing and everyone joined in pretty soon, including our guide, Sina, who could dance very well (but not as good as me ;)). Next bar was Xaos, which was a bit smaller, but just as awesome. And last bar, for us, was Mandala, the largest of the 3. There was a line, Sina took us right through the back door!All 3 were great, and Sina and Jorge really took care of everything.

The crew went out of their way to include everyone in the fun. The hostess, Sina, is one of the warmest and funnest people you will ever meet. If ever they detected that your drink was running empty, they would immediately fill it up with whatever beverage you choose. There were endles rounds of shots to make sure everyone got their drink on. One major advantage to this pubcrawl is that we had bottle/table service at all the clubs we visited. That meant that if you wanted to take a break from the dance floor, there was always a place you could take a seat to relax.Overall, I would highly recommend this PubCrawl to anyone visiting Playa that is looking for a good party with great people."

We where so wrong there where people of all ages and countries, in fact the older ones were the crazier ones haha. This is a really good deal if you want to explore the real nightlife in Playa our previous experience had been Senor Frogs, Carlos and Chalries and Coco Bongo o man we were wrong. Our guide Jorge was excellent made sure we always had a drink in our hand. And I didn\u2019t believe their add about bottle service well friends is true we got bottomless bottle service in two of the three places we visited. A very fun night, felt very safe all night, didn\u2019t have to worry about crooked waiters or dealing with money, no lines, reserved tables , man what else can I say, definitely hand down a 5 star recommendation."

Sina was our guide; she was the best I mean she goes out of her way to make sure we were having fun and making sure we felt safe and comfortable, from the guy trying to take a picture to charge money to bringing us napkins for our sweat from dancing lol. Later the Playacrawl owner arrived to welcome us on the second club, and made sure everything was going good, he is such a cool guy.

The fire show at the Blue Parrot was amazing, and then the final stop was Mandala. This club is right up there with Coco Bongo's for fun. Not the shows that CocoBongo's has, but great music and dancing, etc...... We found a lot of fun that we had never experienced in Playa before thanks to the playacrawl. The price was well worth it, and if you are lucky enough to get Sina for your guide, then I guarantee a great time for all!"

We went on a Monday night and arrived to the hostel/bar maybe 30 minutes early and we were greeted by Sena (sp?) who was the best guide! She got us drinks right away and pregamed before the crawl. There were a total of 12 of us (6 in our group, 6 in theirs) and we were off to the first bar around 10pm. We walked to every bar, each one getting better. The first one we went to was open air and awesome-- we were the only people there so it was like a private party. The shots kept coming (very weak!) but the service was great. The beach bar and fire show were awesome (we also played flipped cup!) and danced on the beach! The final bar was posh and we had VIP entry and bottle service. I would recommend sticking with beer because the drinks weren't so strong-- at least with beer you know what you're drinking! Sena was incredible! She treated us like we were old friends! She even helped us get a cab and talk them down in price. THANKS FOR A GREAT NIGHT!"

We found the \"PlayaCrawl\" online and figured it would be a good value which everyone could afford so we put together a group of 18 people. Let me just say that the drinks were flowing all night long. We started out with a couple of the PlayaCrawl staff at our first 2 stops and they were ridiculously attentive. Whatever you needed they would go grab it from the bar or send a waiter over with more shots.Starting out at about 10pm the first 1-2 places were a little slow by some people's standards, but we were still having a blast. By the 3rd place everyone was in full on party mode and we finished it off by going to a club that had a line wrapped around the block.Each place we went to was VIP treatment. We would walk right in and were taken to a roped off VIP area where we could stay and drink or go out and dance. The staff went above and beyond to make the night extra special for me and my fiance. Overall this was a tremendous value. If you go out on your own you will wait in lines and drop $60 bucks for entrance and drinks pretty quick. We had drinks flowing until 4am.I highly recommend the PlayaCrawl to anybody!!!"

My husband and I along with our friends (2 other couples) got a rare opportunity to steal away from the kids and the daily grind for a 5 night trip to Mexico. For all 6 of us, it was our first time coming to Mexico. We knew we wanted to get out one night and experience Playa del Carmen's nightlife, but to be honest we didn't know where to start, and we were unsure of ourselves being in Mexico. I researched before the trip and stumbled on reviews/website about Playacrawl. I emailed, and Jorge, the sales manager, was very quick in replying and was very helpful with all kinds of info. You are supposed to book through Paypal, but once we were at the resort, our wi-fi wasnt working. Gave a call to Jorge and he told us it was no problem, he would still reserve our spots and we could just pay our guide in cash the night of.Our guide, Miguel, was EXTREMELY helpful!!! He seemed to know everybody everywhere we went. We went to 3 different places (Blue Parrot - also got to see the fire show here, Mandala, Brahma) From all 6 of us, Mandala was our favorite. We had VIP sections every place we went. We knew it was really a good deal when we met some people at the Blue Parrot who told us they paid $40 each just to get in! (Playacrawl is $60 a person and that includes the cover and all you can drink!) We even got bottle service each place we went as well. Miguel was always making sure we had anything we needed - drinks, water, etc. (but he wasn't \"in the way\" either - had a good balance) I would HIGHLY recommend Playacrawl to anyone who wants to experience the nightlife here, doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg, but wants to feel like a VIP! If we ever come back to Playa, or Cancun, I will definitely do this again."

            "review": "Disappointed. We were really excited about doing the Playacrawl based on the wonderful reviews and even for people who had been to Playa for several times before. This was our 3rd time back to Playa. Booking was easy and we met up at the meeting point on Wednesday night, still very excited about our night out. We were told there will be a bigger group then normal, we were fine with it. We went to the clubs zone to meet up with everyone and there was over 30 people more which they had to separate into two groups. There was a Bachelorette and Bachelor party in our group. We told our guide that we've been to Coco Maya and Blue Parrot twice already and was looking forward to visit the new clubs here. He said we will have a chance to go to some of them too when I pointed it out to him.We only got 3 drinks at Coco Maya and 3 at Blue Parrot per person and it was bottom shelf vodka, tequila mixed drinks or shots (no beers). There was a dedicated area to get the drinks and the line was so long due to it being \"Ladies night\", that means free entry and drinks for ladies in those clubs.We went to Coco Maya, Blue Parrot and one other club up the street that we haven't been too before. We had a VIP section for the Bachelorette & Bachelor parties and the rest of the Playacrawl people. Within 5 minutes about 10 other people from the dance floor came up to join our group, knocked down all the drinks (she was dancing on the couch next to the drinks table) and was getting way too crowded. Of course we didn't get to have our \"unlimited drinks\" there. We tried to stay as long as we could but only lasted for 30 minutes and called it a night.Overall, Playacrawl would be great for big groups or someone that has never been out to experience the night life in Playa. For $120 USD for two, limited on our drinks and been to 2 out of 3 clubs before, it was not worth the money for us. One of the guide was really wonderful, being attentive to everyone's needs, getting drinks for the large group and checking in to see if we were okay."

Not because of the open bar but because we had a chance to hit different clubs but better yet everything was taken care of from beginning to end.

Booking process fast and simple, meeting point on time, all you can drink as advertised, very good price if you plan to have more than a few drinks and go more than one place, the guide made sure we felt safe and had a good time, the groups are small which I prefer when doing crawls, in overall very good if what your looking for is to get to know Playa del Carmen's nightlife. I did the Playacrawl Cancun, had lots of fun there so decided to do the one in Playa del Carmen, had even more fun there, hope you guys do to."

They have been long time visitors to Playa del Carmen but do not usually travel off the resort. I was orignally worried that my parents would feel out of place in the Playa del Carmen night life. However, if they did they did not show it our host Miguel did a great job making them feel included and talk to them throughout the night so they did not feel out of place. He also kept the party going for the rest of us and always had a table for us at each location. Having the wristbands at each bar was great! The only downside was that the bars we went to did not have a lot of options for drinks Rum, Tequila and Vodka mixed with OJ, Cranberry, or Coke and Beer. However, it was still well worth the money and a very enjoyable experience. I would definetly do it again."

We stay in town on most trips & know our way around for the most part and really love the vibe there. We had never really gone to any of the dance clubs before, but have done our fair share of bar-hopping in Playa. This year, we had some friends who were in Playa for the first time, so we decided to do the Playacrawl. We had a great time! Everything was easy, from the booking process until the end of the night. Jorge was our guide for the night and we would definitely hang out with him again. If you are looking for a fun & carefree night out in Playa at a great value, whether it is your first time or 8th time there, check out Playacrawl."

            "review": "Great time. This was our first trip to Mexico and we had no idea where to go at night in Playa and we probably wouldn't have ventured off the resort if we hadn't decided to do the Playacrawl. My boyfriend and I met Jorge our guide at the rooftop bar around 10pm. He was there waiting for us and got drinks for us right away. He said we were waiting for another couple who had gotten stuck at the airport, but they never ended up making it out in time. So basically, it was like we had our own private guide to take us around for the night. Jorge is great! He answered all our questions and told us a lot about the area. The first bar on the beach is pretty laid back. The fire show was entertaining and we didn't have to wait for drinks. The second club was the most fun. It ended up getting crowded right after we had been there for ten minutes. They really do know the best times to go everywhere. We spent most of the night dancing and drinking here. Jorge was always around if needed him for anything and let us do our own thing too. By the time we reached the third club I had already had plenty to drink. We didn't stay there long, our own decision, as this place was not really our speed. It is best for people who really like dancing and clubs. We were starting to get tired, so Jorge walked us to a taxi, and made sure the fare was correct with the driver. We said our goodbyes and had a safe ride back to our resort. We were sad to leave! Jorge is a cool guy and we would totally hang out with him if he lived near us! If you are questioning whether to do this or not, go for it. The price is great and you don't have to worry about handling money all night. The drinks were not watered down and we were able to get anything we wanted. It is totally safe and we would do it again if we ever go back to Mexico."

Transaction was smooth and we got clear directions on where to meet up. We did however had a tricky time locating the meeting spot, we asked people in restaurants if they had heard of the bar where we were meeting at and no said the knew about it.Once we got there I recognized Jorge from all the pictures from TripAdvisor. He greeted us and answered all our questions and offered us drinks. Before we left we had already taken 3 tequila shots! The whole night night was fun, I enjoyed all three locations, each one different, but with great atmosphere. Drinks never stopped, and our group was fun and lifely, met new people. Sadly we only had a weekend trip at Playa, that's why we opted for the Playa Crawl tour. Great experience for a Girls Night Out!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks Jorge!"

As we had never been to Playa Del Carmen before, we thought we better do some research into what was on offer. We wanted to have a great time and party so we decided to look into party crawls. After talking to people that we knew that had come here before, they told us that we should look into Playacrawl as they had had a blast with them while they were on vacation too.We ended up doing the bar crawl on the first night we got there which was Saturday night... all i can say is OMG what a fun night. We first me up with the guys that run the playacrawl at Geisha Bar where they we all super friendly and had an awesome party vibes. we all started drinking and having the best time ever. when ever our drink were almost empty the boys would be brining up more drink with out us even having to ask. We went to a few different bars and night clubs (all of which i can remember the names of from the first night lol) but it was so good. As we were staying in playa for a week we deiced to do the bar crawl again before we left. we ended going on it on the Wednesday and its was even crazier than the Saturday night... If there is anything worth doing in playa at night its Playacrawl for sure... I have never drunk so many drink before or been to that many clubs ever before in my life.Playa i love you, but i think i need a rest from the wild crazy party nights."

We just came back from our trip to playa and we did the playacrawl, in resume we had a great time got wasted and made new friends.Our group was pretty small around 8 people but it was perfect we didn\u2019t want a big group, we did it on a Saturday so all places where pretty packed, but we didn\u2019t have to wait in any lines since our guide took us directly in.First Place was Blue Parrot very fun place the night was barely starting so we took it easy there, watched the fire show and that headed to our second place called mandala very nice club very nice music excellent service, drinks kept coming and coming, finally got to out third and last club called brahma, this is the most club ambient of all, there instead of going for our drinks our guide asked for bottles at our tables which was a great idea since it was kind of a hustle getting up top get drinks, although at this time don\u2019t think we needed many more drinks.In all we had a great time, we recommended if you don\u2019t know where to go or you never been out in Playa del Carmen, also the cost is much better if you plan to drink a lot, each drink is around 5 to 7 USD and cover fees around 10 USD so you make the math.Have fun and please say hii to our great guide Miguel he is awesome."

We didn't know that were already started with the Crawl. Their was no direction. We stopped at our first place and it wasn't anything special. Huge liter drinks with barely any alcohol. The place was some what of a dump! Second place we stopped at was the blue parrot. Getting there we received the wrong wrist bands. So we went to the bar for free drinks and weren't allowed to because we had the wrong wrist bands. Finally our host was able to get us the right wrist bands. Only to find out the open bar was in a private section of the club far from the rest of our group of ladies who came with us. They werent allowed because they didn't have the open bar wrist bands. Either way if you are a women or even traveling with ladies they dont pay cover or pay for drinks!! (on thursday) The next club we went to was mandal. Mandal was 10x better then the other places we went to. The staff was great and we got a private section on the balcony. This place was a true nightclub. Our crawl ended there. We thought we were heading to another places but that didn't happen. Overall i was expecting more with the clubs and our host. At least it was something to do."

Second only to the cave swim we did ;) This trip was to celebrate my friends 40th birthday party and the only request she had was \u201cto have the best birthday ever\u201d \u2013 and that was made possible because of Playacrawl and, of course, Miguel and Xavier (our guides for the evening)! She felt like a Princess the whole time with VIP status everywhere we went. The service and attention that we received at all of the clubs was 5 Star and I believe that was all due to the connections your company and staff has. I hadn't been to Playa del Carmen since the 90's and I was shocked at how expensive everything is now (cover charges, drinks, food)...so considering that, the Playacrawl was a very affordable option for a night on the town.  I travel a lot and rely heavily on reviews myself so am sure that my positive experience will be appreciated by those considering the Playacrawl."

My wife and i just came back from our wonderful holiday and we had a great time. I have been on many barcrawls around the world and the Playa one is the best i have been on.We did the Playacrawl last Thursday it was a small group of around 15 people which was perfect for us as we didn't want a big crowd , we got to meet cool people that where doing the crawl too and actually got to talk to most of them.Our guide was excellent very attentive and fun he made sure our night was a fun one, and made us felt secure .We went to 3 places , at Blue parrot we got to see the fire show. There was not a lot of people but I guess we get where there early at 10PM. After and our favorite was the second bar, I think is called Mandala. The drinks are more than enough believe me lol they are telling the truth when they tell you all you can drink all night lol, you can get any cocktail (if you are into cocktails like me).Overall we had a great experience, we went out another night by ourselves and we spend more money and we didn't get nearly as drunk as we did the crawl night also not as much fun as we where concern about entrances, drinks, safety etc, so the crawl its definitely worth the money. Well hope you guys have a lot of fun and hope this helps, cheers.I have been a few times to playa del carmen and it has always been safe, even in the late hours, there is a lot of security everywhere and police. I just don't understand how some security guards from the third club on the barcrawl tried to mug some of the people on the barcrawl? probably these people were using drugs in the toilets or trying to buy some. In Mexico drugs are illegal so if youre up for the challenge go for it, but i wouldnt recommend it. To the person who wrote the bad comment about the Playacrawl i tell you: maybe you would ask your friend or husband to be more honest with you and tell you the whole story behind all this toilet mugging."

At around 2:45 am 15 min before we had to leave, my husband and one other person from our group were mugged in the washroom by Mexican \"security guards\" who demanded that they pay them $100US or they would call the police. They pulled out little bags of cocaine and said they would tell the police it was theres unless they paid them. These guards followed us from the second bar we went to and our \"guide\" was speaking to them all night, so I am sure that he had something to do with it as well.......I know this doesn't happen to everyone but it ruined our night and I would use extreme caution when leaving the resort and going out at night, even the orgainized tours are not safe."

For the price and personal attention from the host, Jorge, you are bound to have a fabulous and fun evening. Just remember to bring your camera so you can remember everything the next morning! The tour was $50 per person and well worth the money, we stopped at 6 or 7 bars, I lost count somewhere in the evening. For $50, all of the cover charges were taken care of and it was an open bar at most of the bars. Trust me, you will never be without a drink! A total of 8 people made reservations for the evening but it only ended up being 4 of us and we had a total blast. Jorge was very attentive to anything we needed, yet still gave us our space to venture out and see what we could get into. He was happy to tell us anything we wanted to know about the Mexican culture and was very knowledgeable about the happening places in Playa Del Carmen. Within an hour of the crawl, I felt like he was a long time friend of ours. We miss him and will definitely do the Crawl again if we ever make it back to Playa Del Carmen."

Now you must buy your lounge chair from a guy who sits near the bathroom. You cannot get there before 9AM or the rude Security will tell you to leave. After staying there for the day they are losing a fortune since nobody checks to see if you purchased a wrist band or not. The people next to me were there all day for free. The old system was better. The fact that in Mexico people can sit directly in front of you on the beach makes this beach club a place I can do without. Next to Mamita is the public beach. Once again it seems to me they are doing so much business they do not care about the quality of the food or keeping the beach clean. Playa is loaded with tourists so Mamita could care less if you like it or not. Waiters are OK but I suggest you go up to Quinta Avenida and have a great lunch."

We brought our own towels so that was one expense that we didn\u2019t have to worry about. We drank the day away and only ordered a basket of fries. The drinks were pricey. We closed our tab after three rounds of drinks and did find and automatic 15% tip added. We had a few more rounds and closed again only for the waiter to tell us that our card was declined. We knew that was inaccurate considering we had a prepaid Travelex card and knew exactly how much we had on it. We finally settled the bill in cash. And used our Tavelex card for dinner at another restaurant. Just be sure to keep your eye on your tab. I wouldn\u2019t say the service was great but even after tipping our waiter serval times he didn\u2019t seem to check on us anymore than he had before.

The food was average but the drinks were cold. We spent around $1100 pesos on F & B each visit. Ask to see the bill before paying as they may have already added a 15% tip."

The view is amazing and it makes up for the over priced beer. The waiters are very nice, but make sure you are keeping tabs on what you consume. Also,check their website for the pricing on the rentals of the umbrellas, beach chairs, and beds. Make sure they are charging you according to what they advertise. They have been known to over charge people, so just keep and eye out. The DJ was spinning awesome chill music and it's conducive to the environment. The only negative thing is the beach beds are not in the best of shape. The sun has beaten them up and they look a little dirty. I recommend the umbrella and beach chairs.

The \"club\" is a day beach club right by the beach. Looks really nice but unfortunately the service is extremely bad. We arrived and wanted to sit on their beach with drinks so asked to buy cocktails to go. Asked 2 different waiters if this was possible and yes it was. However, ordering could not be done by those two waiters, we had to go to the bar. So we did. And yes again were told we can order cocktails to go. After we spend 5 minutes deciding which ones we want (we were 5 people) the bartender tells us that oh we can only buy it if we also buy a main dish!! Not something anyone thought of telling us, or him for that matter earlier. After some deliberation, and since we were already there, we finally decided to buy a main dish and take it to go. We then asked if we could sit on their beds since we bought the food and the cocktails (this was by the end of the day around 5 and they close at 6). Of course this was absolutely not possible as we would have to rent the beds (in other places beds simply require a minimum purchase of 200 pesos). Obviously here we would have to buy everything and only 1 hour left before closing. At the same time my friend wanted to go to the bathroom and was rejected at the door because we hadn t bought anything yet. We were so appalled that we left. Zero customer service."

First we waited for 5-10 minutes for the waiter to come to our table only to Tell us how much we had to pay. When we asked for a receipt we had to wait another 5 minutes. On the receipt the amount was 505 pesos but the waiter earlier told us 580 pesos, so he added the tips himself. We paid the amount on the receipt and gave him around 40 pesos as a tip. He then told us we had to pay another 40 pesos as a tip and that 15 % of the bill is the minimum tip you can give in Mexico. We've now been in Mexico for 2 weeks and have never heard anything like that from any other restaurant. There was no service charge on the bill and it did not say anything else either about tip. We told the waiter this and he said it says in the menu that tip is not included (but it does not say that you are obligated to pay any or how much!). For us tips is not something you can demand, it depends on the service you give. Tomorrow we will choose another beach club.."

We said, great, we'll take that.Once inside, things went south fast. We were moved over to beach umbrella and chairs, which did indeed cost 200 pesos, but were not the VIP beds or the pool. We inquired and found out the VIP on the beach is 2000 pesos, and the VIP for the pool is 1800 pesos, and you are not allowed to go between the two areas even if you buy VIP. Quite the bait and switch. Tunes were pretty good, nothing you wouldn't get at any other beach club. Beach is nice, but absolutely covered in seaweed. Had two drinks and left. It's an okay place, but don't expect what you read in the positive reviews and don't expect prompt or responsive service. You'd be better served bringing your own beer to the adjacent public beach and throwing down a towel there, IMO."

When we arrived the waiter directed us to some chairs and told us that someone will be around to collect the rental for the beach chairs. When the fee is paid, you get an armband. This is independent of any food and drinks that may be ordered. The price is 200 pesos for two chairs and an umbrella, which is clearly stated on the menu, although I did over hear them trying to charge some Gringos more.The food and drinks were fine, but on the expensive side. If you rented beach chairs, you can use the bathrooms and showers for free. Otherwise, there is a charge. The bill came and it was exactly as expected, with no attempted add ons of anything like a tip (which they are not supposed to add to the bill anyway.)As long as you realize this place is expensive for Playa, I would recommend it without hesitation."

It was little further from the Dj but still had a cool vibe to it. The waiter was a little slow on drink service but nothing too bad. (Side note: If you forget your towel no problem. They loan them to you for a small fee)On my fourth day in Playa (my birthday) we opted for a cabana (large bed) which was still 200 pesos only this time with a spending limit of 2000 pesos. We got a bottle of tequila and some food for the three of us which worked perfectly. This time our cabana was right in line with the DJ and we had an awesome time! The waiter was more attentive this time. He refilled our ice bucket and even made our drinks for us on occasion.I have to note that its probably better to split a bottle because the drinks here are pricier than other bars or beach areas. There are signs all over the beach saying you cant bring outside alcoholic beverages but literally feet away from us there were a lot of people drinking store bought stuff. So you can probably get the same vibe if you're on a budget. Just stay off the beds. We saw quite a few people trying to sneak their way onto them. They never lasted very long. I would definitely recommend this place if you love a cool, loungy vibe. "

The price is definitely 200 pesos for 2 loungers and an umbrella (they give you a wristband), with no minimum consumption, in fact the waiters won't even bother you unless you call them over. These lounger prices are printed right on their menu. Wifi is OK, but free only for an hour, but you can try to ask for another code after that. However, there are several big signs that say you cannot bring any of your own food or drinks, and I'm sure they will enforce this. Food prices are a bit on the high side, but not terribly so. We just ate lunch up the street (Calle 28/29) or went back to our condo for a bite. They play loud mood electro-pop or \"trance\" music which did fit the scene well. That recent reviewer who claimed they charged ridiculous prices must've been confused by a VIP section, or was being conned? (The Grand Hyatt next door wanted 1000 pesos each for chairs for non-guests!!!) The beach between about Calle 10 and Constituyentes is pretty much unusable, very narrow with large sand bags (to prevent erosion), fishing boats, lots of weed, and smelly, although there are a few beach bars there. From the main pier (Juarez) to Calle 10 the beach is also good, and again several less classy beach bars. Most seem to charge about 100-150 pesos/chair, but some seem to imply the chairs were free if you ate or drank something - it was hard getting a straight answer out of the waiters. Wah-Wah's near the pier, however don't charge for chairs at all, and you could probably get by with only a small drink purchase. The beach running north from Mamita's is great running all the way around the point to El Marlyn Azul (about 4-5 km), but the beach services get progressively less until there are almost no people on it. The only way to use the beach south of Juarez/Pier is through Sr. Frog's (make like you're going to the bar, but then just slip down to the beach), or walk way around into Playacar past their security gate, like you're staying there. The beach there is excellent with very few people, but no services at all. There are no public restrooms anywhere on the beach, but of course most or all of the beach bars have them. Mamita's is very clean, and the best one was in the Grand Hyatt behind their pool, which you can walk into by making like you stay there. Funny thing, no one seems to use them hardly at all. Hmmm, I wonder where they have a pee while spending the whole day at the beach???"

We went there today and had read different positive reviews with fairly new ones which included prices ranging from $100 pesos to $350 pesos including an umbrella and a lounge chair. The $350 pesos price included drinks or a food credit for $350 pesos. When we got there we were told for two people for only 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella it would cost us $1,500 pesos ($90.00 usd) and it didn't include any drink or food credit. There's not a beach anywhere that I know of that would charge anywhere near those prices. You can buy an umbrella and chairs at Walmart for far less, use it for your vacation and throw it out ( or give it to someone) for far less than what you would pay for one day to the thieves at the beach. Or if you'd like have lunch at Senor Frogs and get a few drinks and swim at their private beach for free."

Umbrellas were a safe haven for when the sun was really strong. After talking to other and walking up and down the beach, this was the most relaxed sophisticated choice. Will definitely visit again when I go back."

I rented a chair for 100 pesos and ordered a mojito from a waiter who delivered it to my chair. The drink was okay. It came in a plastic cup which made it feel like a regular beach day. My server, Gerard,was attentive. However, he didn't give me a bracelet which created go fusion when I went to use the bathroom. I got a bracelet after. I guess i had high expectations based on the reviews. I go to beach all the time in Brooklyn and was hoping for a fancy experience since I never get that at home. This was nice but nothing to rave about. There is techno music that plays but no one seemed to take an interest in it. Just another beach day really. I should add that it was a Monday and the weather went from sunny to windy to cloudy to rainy all day. I think this affected my experience also. I remember when I arrived in PDC in Saturday seeing lots of people here. I think I would have had fun under different conditions.  Also, as I was leaving, I realized didn't even need the chair since many people were laying right on the sand. Again, a regular beach here. It's also a short distance between the sand and water, creating the appearance of crowds, but it's just a small area. On another note, on my last day I made my way to the other side if PDC where the ferry from Cozumel comes in. Senor Frogs has a beach club there and there were some other cool beach front tiki type bars. The beaches themselves were spacious with chairs all over for patrons. The street over here reminded my of California. I. wish I had gotten a chance to enjoy this area sooner. Try to check it out."

The day before New Years Eve we bought tickets from the organisers in front of the beach club. They were very friendly and happy to give us the tickets and take our money. we asked for the VIP tickets on the rooftop and paid extra for that, which At that time was no problem. Before handing over the money to them, we asked about 10 times, is this the VIP area on the rooftop and they all reassured us that it was. They told us that we were getting the rooftop area which had our own seating area for the two of us. On the night when we arrived, we had to wait about 10 minutes to be escorted inside. Once they processed our tickets, they said to us your are downstair. After explaining to the girl and guy that we purchased the tickets from that it was you that told us that we were getting VIP on the rooftop. Even with all that being on paper, that was not enough evidence. After again trying to speak to someone else, we stood in the middle of the foyer area like idiots, while they chatted away in Spanish right in front of us. After what looked like a debate between each other, we were escorted upstairs, only again to be told by another person that we are downstairs. We were escorted back to the organisers, again they discussed things, and the same lady that booked the tickets for us, said no you are downstairs and thats what I told you in the beginning. By now, this had been going on for at leased 20-30 mins and their frustration was starting to show in their attitudes.We refused to let them ruin our NYE, we enjoyed our night which was complimented by one of the kindest and nicest waiters we have come across on our travels to Mexico."

Even with earplugs in, it sounds like we are in the club, instead of down the beach in a palapa. At 2 am, the bass was still pumping. It astounds me how disrespectful this club is to their neighbors. Half of our hotel was in the lobby complaining. The police were called. The manager said it he couldn't go into the office of the hotel because the music is deafening. The quaint, lovely resort is otherwise heavenly, but ruined by one crappy business, which I'd somewhat expect in Cancun, but not in Playa del Carmen.

It cost 90 pesos to rent them for the day (around $6)- you also can't bring outside food/beverages, so you will be ordering drinks and food throughout the day - which can be a bit pricey, but not terrible. Our second day we weren't able to find chairs & an umbrella. We saw on the menu that you could rent a covered beach bed for 200 pesos, so we sat down on one. Then a waiter approached us and told us that in addition to the 200 pesos to rent the bed, you also had to meet a minimum consumption of around 1,000 pesos (of food and alcohol). We decided that we didn't want to have to pay that much, so we went over to the beach club next door. On our third beach day, Mamita's was packed again, so we went over to the neighboring beach club. On our 4th beach day, we are not going to even bother to stop at Mamita's and look for spots - too much effort & the odds of finding a spot aren't in our favor. Also, if you want to do things on the cheap, there is an area of public beach in front of the beach clubs & hotels. If you bring an umbrella or your own chairs, or towels, you can sit in the public section for free. We saw lots of people doing that and bringing coolers of their own filled with beverages & food. If we had brought our kids with us, we probably would have brought an umbrella and chairs in our suitcase to save on the beach club prices (or we would have just done an all-inclusive)."

We rented 4 loungers and 2 umbrellas ($180 pesos no minimum consumption). We swam in the ocean and then my daughter wanted to swim in the pool. No problem. We ate, drank and were merry- spent a lot of money and tipped well- it is vacation right? We returned last week with my parents and were excited about repeating our great day with them. We rented the same chairs ($180 pesos now a minimum of $150 peso each consumption- no problem) and my mom took my daughter over to the pool. We were told it was separate now and would be an additional charge of 30 pesos each and another $150 peso minimum to swim in the pool. We skipped it and swam at the beach.Two days later we came back ready to eat lunch and spend a day by the pool. We asked if we ate in the restaurant if that would qualify as our minimum for the loungers- NO. Ok so we moved to the pool. Tons of empty loungers and a 4 top table- perfect, we will eat at the table because it is kind of tricky to eat a nice big lunch on a lounger. We were told if we wanted to eat at the table it would be 200 pesos 150 minimum per person and then if we moved to the loungers it would be 30 pesos per person and another 150 peso minimum. Seriously? We left. I understand trying to make money off of tourists- but this is ridiculous! We went next door to Kool. Sorry Mamitas- you lost loyal fans with the nickel and dime tactics. I own a condo and will advise my guests to go somewhere else. Such a shame because we loved it just 6 weeks ago."

I let him know that we needed a beach umbrella for 2 people and he looked at me in a somewhat dismissive way and said they were full. I had to work to keep my cool... After some back and forth, a woman came over that worked there. I cannot remember her name, but she had 'Captain' on her tag. She was very nice and worked to get my Mom and I a beach umbrella and chairs. About 20 minutes later, one opened up and she showed us to our spot. I was beginning to feel better about this place until 10 minutes later when we had not been approached by a waiter for drinks or anything. I literally had to get up out of my seat and approach someone that looked like a waiter to ask for service. He gave me a crappy look and said he would get someone and walked away. I was fuming as I saw all of the other customers getting service. 5 minutes later, we were approached by a waiter that had no menus or anything. He asked us if we wanted anything. I asked him for a menu and he looked at me and then went to the girls that were sitting next to us and grabbed their menu and handed it to me. As if it was an imposition!!! I ordered us food and drinks.The drinks were fine but when our food came out, there were no napkins or silverware. I had to ask for them!@! Who brings food out to a beach chair and does not bring these things. Especially after we paid 90 pesos for the privelege of sitting in their chairs!?! He looked at me with an attitude and then brought them out.I won't go on, but you get the gist... If you like pretention and horrible service and being treated like it is a privilege to be at their establishment. Otherwise, avoid Mamita's at all costs and find a beach club in Playa that will treat you with kindness and respect!"

The weekend prices to rent beds requires bottle service -- two bottle minimum which does not include wine. The bottle prices are outrageous and it promotes people getting just hammered at the beach club - always a pretty sight. I enjoyed the music but the service is extremely slow. Such a shame this beach club went to hell. It has become yesterday's news on the cool factor."

A younger crowd with pumping music, which contrary to some of the other Trip Advisor reviewers, we actually love since we've been to Ibiza. To us, the music should actually be louder with the same amount of bass, since all we hear is bass and not the rest of the music. The staff is rude and will approach with different prices from day to day??.... Service is poor. We haven't tried it, but apparently, the Wifi cost money contrary to most of the businesses in Playa. If I were them, I would advertise an honest price for the chairs and stick to the price, provide good drink service, and provide free Wifi. They would likely get a good client base and better reviews."

One part is with common sun beds and umbrellas and the other looks like beds with room (you may see something similar on Niki Beach but nothing so cheap looking). When you choose option No. 1 you have to be there until 09:30 A.M. because you will not find any umbrella after that time. Option No. 2 costs 200 pesos and you have to buy at least two bottles of alcohol which \"good\" politics on sun. The staff is other story. They are incompetent and you may see them everywhere but if you want something they still say that somebody else will come later. You cannot drink and eat there anything except the meals and drinks bought there. Other story is music. I like electronic music but Dj there is probably the worst Dj I ever heard and not only in Mexico where is electronic music very frequent. Even when they play music it is the worst music I ever heard not only in Mexico. Yes, for people who do not like electronic music, I do not recommend this place because you will not hear anything else. In the afternoon you may also see and hear very loud crowd of drunk teenagers. Other thing you may hear during the day is construction of buildings in area of Mamita Beach Club. Maybe because of that they play terrible music to cover all the noise from the drills and other construction equipment."

It was small and rustic and lots of young adults played on the white sand and in the clear water. The wait staff was attentive and the food and drinks were reasonably priced.I don't know what's going on with the water and it's certainly no fault of the owners at Mamita's, but copious amounts of seaweed wash on shore and clumps of it float in the water, along with a lot of other garbage. They don't bother to clean the beach often, occasionally bringing in a crew of workers with pitchforks, rakes and shovels to dig trenches and bury the smelly vegetation. Of course they do that during the busiest part of the day, rather than taking a tractor down the beach at night and hauling the stuff away.In spite of declining beauty of the beach, Mamita's continues to increase its prices. They can do so because the place is no longer hip. The crowd is older, balder, fatter and wealthier. They're also pretentious and snobbish. Beds and lounges that used to rent for $10 or $20 now go for $60 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. In an gauche display of faux sophistication, Mamita's now has bottle service and it has a two bottle minimum to rent a bed and umbrella on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Needless to say, we went next door to Kool beach club. It had fewer pretentious jerks who like to show off how much money they can throw away."

The service was apathetic at best, and it took forever to deliver our drinks and guacamole. Under normal circumstances we would have left, but were in a good mood after a wonderful vacation. The drinks were fine--it's hard to mess up on beer--but the guacamole was very bland. So we ate less than half, paid the ridiculously-high tab, and returned to our hotel. Within about an hour, we were violently ill, and were very lucky to be able to board our flight home the next day. I felt nauseous for another three days, and barely ate.

If it was good but its terrible.If you pay for chairs and an umbrella beware that someone who comes late will put there chair in your shade. I see that 20% of the people that come later in the day dont pay since the guys they have collecting the fee dont even care. The bathroom they check your wristband.The showers are used by all the people who dont pay a penny. There is no control.LOW CLASS LOW CLASS for people who have no class. Everyone is drunk so they really could care less. Enjoy Mamitas...if you enjoy the Disney of Playa"

We arrived early (before 8am and 10am on a cloudy day) and it packed up well at around noon. The music starts at around 1PM and can be really loud. People also put their towels right in front of you on the beach so if you want a quiet and remote place, Mamita's isn't for you! The bracelet they give you when you pay for the chair gives you access to the washrooms, which are very clean (20 pesos each time if you don't have your bracelet).The food was surprisingly good (we had fish ceviche, breakfast, nachos and a very tasty watermelon (sandia) juice). The only thing is that when the waiter brought la cuenta upon our departure, he showed the suggested total including tip (which is usually done in restaurants in Mexico, 10% for ok service and 15% for excellent service). Good thing my mom looked it up because the waiter charged a 25% tip!!! We lowered the tip and the waiter looked a bit shy. By the time we were paying, another customer came to the manager of the restaurant and asked her why his waiter asked for a 30% tip! I understand we are on the beach and there are multiple services, but I believe a customer should be choosing how much he gives, and certainly not be imposed with a 25% rate tip!But overall, Mamita's was well located for us and the waiters were (despite the tip) very nice. I wish my hotel (Riviera Maya Caribe hotel) had told me they had vouchers for a discount at Mamita's beach club!"

I had high expectations of celebrating New Years in Mamitas, the cost of the event and bottles were really high, so I expected that we would get our money\u00b4s worth. Big disappointment, highly overrated, to expensive and nothing really fun about the party. The service was ok, but for what the flyer of the party said and expectation created.. had nothing to do with the real thing. Really boring party, bad music, they hardly did nothing special to receive the New Year at 12 pm and way to expensive. Do not recommend going there for a New Years party, there are way more options at better prices. Big Disappointment."

Imagine we depend $38USA on drinks and food and the guy who was rude to us all day wanted a tip to boot! We complained to the manager about the nasty rudeness and she apologized on their behalf. Today we went back with our coupons and the waiters didn't even want to seat us. Me being 6'3\" just took the four chairs and handed them out coupons and basically told him to take a hike. He called the manager over and when she saw me she told the waiter to back off. Think he did? No!The place is a complete rip off and way over priced. If you go there you are fools so don't complain. Tip: beaches are public so set up your towels and cooler on the beach away from the chairs and just walk over to your towel for water etc because Mamitas has a policy of you Not bringing food or drink to the beach but they can't stop you if you set up a separate towel on the beach. Oh they'll still hassle you even though you either paid or got free tickets from your condo rental."

The one waiter could have told us, we were treated like criminals). They preceded to watch us like hawks all day. We ordered a ceviche (180 pesos), a beer and a mojito (95 pesos) and received attitude all day for not ordering more. This alone made us not want to give them a penny more of our money. When we asked for the bill the waiter added on a 5$ tip. Umm..firstly how presumptuous and secondly after giving us attitude and treating us terribly all day I don't think so! We gave him 2$ and he told us to please not come again. Imagine! This is how you treat people!? Am I wrong to assume a tip is given for good service. No where is there a minimum spend posted.

The guy who served us looked like we had disturbed his day! First of all one of the loungers the guy gave us was broken and after paying for them watched us run around to find one that actually worked. We ordered two cocktails at 95 pesos each (which is around ,\u00a34.50 -\u00a35 which isfairly pricey for Playa Del Carmen,). Total rip off. After a long wait the server brought them and put them behind us without saying anything. Noticed them a couple of minutes later. No wonder, they were very small with little or no alcohol, just mainly ice and salt (mine was a marguerita). Later tried to get the servers attention to buy water (you can't bring your own) and despite being in front of us just ignored us. When went to pay the bill ( asking different people 3 times) the waiter self tipped himself 15% which really annoyed me as the service was awful and we only bought 2 drinks and no food.

Plenty of Beach staff checking for food and drink orders. I marked them down a couple notches for a few reasons, 1. food and beverage prices are high. 2. Exchange rate to USD was a matter of inconvenience to Mamitas. 3. Beach service was spotty. Of the seven days we spent on the beach, the first day we were welcomed and about every 15 minutes, checked on to see if anything was needed. After the first day we had to flag someone down for any kind of service. There was plenty of staff and not busy. Just seemed that they were trying to avoid us. We ordered food and beverages almost every day and left good tips. They are adding on to this Club and is only getting bigger. Good luck."

Seeing as it is a club, to access one of the many beach chairs, umbrellas, and beach beds you had to pay a fee but the prices were reasonable and the chairs were comfy.I really enjoyed the great service our waiters provided, they ensured ours drinks and food were delivered right to our spot so that we never lifted a finger. Although, the food is over priced.The washrooms and bar area were modern and well maintained.

We wanted to spend time at Playa del Carmen and needed a beach club. Mamitas is right on the beach, and the beach is beautiful (clear water, soft sand). Loads of locals frequent the beach, so it is very busy. As others have said, the service does kinda suck. I don't think they are in it for repeat business. But for two beach lounges/chairs and an umbrella, the cost was only $9. Super cheap, particularly as the website states the price is MUCH higher. If there's a next time, we might try the Kool beach Club right next door on the beach. They seemed to have better equipment/furniture.Note: To the right of Mamitas Beach Club - just past the Kool Beach Club is a jetskiing and massage stand. The owner, Miguel, is great and so are the prices. My husband and I had a fantastic couples massage right on the beach and negotiated a good price. It was literally less than one-third what was being charged at our resort, yet the massage therapist clearly took pride in their work. That was a nice surprise."

As they make you buy in from them. Since its inception huge traffic area they get the people anyway so they are taking advantage big time. With beds ranging from 200 pesos to 200 pesos plus 2000 pesos minimum consumption. Not enough umbrellas. Waiters and staff including the manager not friendly and with an attitude. You are better off walking a bit along the beach and choosing a different place or bring your own towel and portable chair.

Some of the chairs could use replacing and were sagging with little or no support...but hey you are at one of the most beautiful beaches in the world! There is a small pool and outdoor showers tucked back on the side of the restaurant. Pool costs extra $$ to sit there and you need to purchase at least $30 in food/drink to use it. While we were there there was major construction taking place so if you don't mind constant jack hammering...go for it. Honestly, the beach is way better! The construction noise was not heard at the beach...just the beautiful sound of waves. We ate lunch twice at this club. I do not recommend the burgers! The taste was bad as was the quality of the meat. Don't go for the food,,,, go for the beach and all it has to offer! No seaweed, no rocks...just beautiful white sand and blue warm water!"

It's a PUBLIC BEACH, how is this terrible business allowed to post these signs? The waiters/security on the beach hover around you, eye-baling your every move. We were so looking forward to this \"amazing\" beach club, but we left after 30 minutes of being pestered and badgered for drinks. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to the open beach, save yourself the money and peace and quiet. For shame Mamita's."

I am not sure what has preempted the changes at this beach club in allowing you to use their umbrellas, but after paying to use one, they wouldn't allow us to, stating the winds were too strong. The adjacent beach club was using umbrellas so we moved over to that beach club. I will never go to this beach club again. To make matters worse, after charging me for beach equipment that they wouldn't allow me to use, they charged us $28 for the two drinks we ordered before we left. Horrible service. Horrible value."

Service is generally good, sometimes slow, but never frustratingly slow. The house music can be loud if your chairs are located in the back row but in order to get front row seating you'll need to arrive when they open at 8am. Mixed drinks (kind of weak) are $95 (pesos) and beer was $40-50 (pesos) I believe. Two chairs and an umbrella was $70 (pesos). I probably wouldn't have chosen to spend the day here but it was so close to my condo and I was so very lazy that one day. We had a good time nonetheless and if another lazy day struck, I'd probably bite the bullet and pay the prices."

You must get here before 10 am if you want to rent an umbrella with your lounge chairs which together only cost 90 pesos which is very inexpensive since you can use them the whole day. Both times we ate breakfast in their restaurant which was delicious and cost around 330 pesos for 2 full breakfasts with coffee, juice and tip. While on the beach we had great and very friendly service from our waiters Edwin and Niccolas, whom were very easy to get their attention and service. Both times they let me run a tab which was convenient. And their bathroom is very clean. I don't understand the negative reviews because each time I have come to this beach club both my 13 year old daughter and I have had a great time for not that much money. Yes the beach is crowded but so are most of the beaches and the music volume did not bother us at all. We will definitely come here again on our next trip to Playa."

I went with my small son who is a year and a half, we felt like it was too crowded too expensive and really no place for him to play.

Fabulous way to spend your time as the water here is clear and they keep the beaches very clean. A relatively new phenomena at Mamitas beach is that the jetskis going back and forth along the beach drive VERY close to the shore. So if you want to go in the water more than about 5-10 meters (that is up to your waist) be very, very careful because the jetski drivers dont care who they might run over. This is a disaster waiting to happen. I was at mamitas today and the jetski driver was screaming at all the swimmers to get out of the water. THese drivers used to go out far enough so that you could have a relaxing swim and even snorkel (beautiful fish in these waters). NO MORE! Too bad the beach club cant make these jetski operators go a bit farther out so that everyone can enjoy their time at mamitas-sun bathers, swimmers, and jetski fans."

I left the amount due without the optional service charge as it was not deserved.. I was chased at the exit by the server demanding a service charge, I left him a bundle of change from my pocket, probably about 200 pesos mainly because I was stunned and amazed by his brashness. We left to what sounded like a traditional Mexican verbal insult. Beware Mamitas some people Speak Spanish to a degree.

Sometimes they require minimum consumption when it is super crazy or when they have special guest dj's.Be sure to bring your flip flops, cash, and a smile because you will surely have a good time at playa mamitas. The drinks and food weren't overly priced for being such a nice place and on the beach. I think beers were like 3 bucks.. compared to a dollar on 5ta."

            "review": "Nice place to find chairs/umbrellas/service on the beach. I'm used to $20 USD chairs in Miami, so when Mamita's asks for 30 pesos per chair and per umbrella - it's a bargain! (we have been going on the weekdays so far... the weekend was just a zoo)Yes, maybe the chairs are a bit older, but you're bringing your own towel anyway to lie on! The man who collects the fee for the chair and umbrella is a no-nonsense sort of guy, part of the job I guess. He needs to crack down on the freeloaders and whiners and collect the fees. This part of the beach around 28 ave is really nice, and the surf is very even, not a choppy break so swimming is easy. We tried a bit further up the beach, but some of the private beaches and hotels won't let you rent chairs/umbrellas from them. The music at Mamitas is good, and the buildings are new, and washrooms are very clean. There is parking for your car, small pool for kids, and an outside shower too. We thought the service was good, but I guess that depends on your server and the crowds too. Beer is 44 pesos I believe, but if you're dying for a cheaper drink you can walk up 28th to a taco stand for beer there - 25 pesos. The fajitas are good, not plentiful, but it's a convenient snack for 120 pesos.Remember, you're at a beachclub to enjoy your time at the beach! I wouldn't fuss over slow service or paying a bit more because, well, life could be worse!"

It was overpriced, but included two bottles of your choice, and unlimited mixers(sodas, mineral water or juices). The service was average. We had a perfect view, in front of the sea.We ordered some food, and I had the scallop ceviche and was DELICIOUS! All the instalations are very clean and nice(bathrooms, massage spa). If you can, bring your own towel, because here it costs 60 pesos, plus a 250 deposit.Around 4 pm, the beach was kind of crowded, but with our bed, didn't feel so. But then, the staff put sunbeds for more people next to our bed. That was weird because we had 2 persons staring at us,almost sharing the bed or the mini roof.I saw a lot of people getting by the beach with their own towels and coolers, and sitting in front of Mamitas, without having to rent a sunbed or consume anything. So maybe if you dont want to spend a lot of money, this is other option.If you are looking for a bar scene-vegas beach club style, with dj's, and people watching and drinking alcohol, this its the place in Playa."

Some reviewers were complaining about the quality of the chairs but we did not encounter this, both visits we had good comfortable chairs. It did cost 90 pesos ($8 US Dollars) for 2 chairs and an umbrella but you get to use them all day. You can have the food on the beach or go into the restaurant (we chose the restaurant). I had the fajitas, mixed shrimp and steak, and it was delicious. It also came with black beans and guacamole. I enjoyed it so much I had it again 2 days later. My daughter had the bagel with chicken breast and it was also good. I had a margarita and it was weak but tasted good. The bathroom facilities are very clean and you can use either the one by the pool or the one in the restaurant. We will definitely come here again on our next trip."

We walked five miles (truly!) down the beach, in an ultra-long walk from our hotel that ended at Playa del Carmen. The walk was a great experience, taking us past every type of beach sight -- giant hotels with wall-to-wall loungers, vendors of every sort, empty stretches, a deserted area that looked like a bit of a hook-up area, even a park with many local families swimming and picnicking. But it was hot, and we were tired and needed sustenance at the end. Mamita's seemed like a nice spot right on the beach, so we went in for lunch. The guacamole was delicious and extremely fresh, and my garden salad with tuna (a modification, which they were kind to do) was great, but my husband's chicken sandwich was pretty pedestrian. They were nice about giving us the log in so we could use the Internet on our phones, and the service was friendly and thorough, if more than a little slow. I will say the guy made a point not only of pointing out that the tip wasn't included but suggesting specifically what it should be, but I didn't really fault him -- it was a hustle with a smile, at least."

We have rented loungers and umbrellas, bought food and drink. Generally ok. However today it was quite different. I used the men's washroom mid morning, no problem, left a tip in the tip jar as I usually do. Often when using the washroom the cleaning ladies come in and out, pass by the men using the urinals, sweeping or cleaning! Not used to that, however, it is not a practice one expects! Today as I was leaving there was a lady guarding the men's washroom door. Not the ladies, ladies went in in front of me without interference, however, I was stopped and told 20 pesos! Not a large amount but the fellow behind me said, what 20 pesos to use the bathroom, answer was yes, 20 pesos! I had left a tip earlier and only take small change unless I plan to eat and drink there, so I had only small change. Offered it to her, she said, no, 20 pesos! So I said adios! I know it costs to operate the washroom, however, 20 pesos seems like a lot for one use. Not sure what I will do next time? The inconsistency bothers me as does the practice of having the cleaning ladies walking by and treating lady guests differently than the men."

There is no doubt about it Mamitas Beach Club (and next door Kool) are situated on one of the best stretches of beach in Playa del Carmen. But what is it with these beach places that they think people want to hear loud \u2018music\u2019 all day?! Calling it music maybe too much of a compliment - I\u2019m no expert but I think it is more like the incessant thud-thud of tuneless, formless \u2018dance\u2019 stuff you would find in a night club. Perhaps the very young enjoy it, but from what I could see, the age range of people hoping to enjoy some beach lounger time ranged from zero to their 60\u2019s or even 70\u2019s. If you want to spend time on a beach without the noise, you have to go to either the Playacar end of Playa or head past Mamitas on the northern end until there is a stretch of beach with no sun loungers, no drinks service but just the sound of the sea and the odd seagull\u2026.bliss!"

So if you're from the US, don't complain about the service, it is not SLOW, it is simply delivered at a \"leisurely\" pace.On to the food: Shared a lunch with a friend of mine, who is a chef, so we were a bit pickier than most guests I guess.We were there during lunch, the restaurant was mostly empty, however we did get a nice table next to the beach which provides a very nice \"view\", depending on your preference for males or females.We shared a fish ceviche, guacamole and grilled octopus with onions and the habanero(can't remember the name of the sauce) on the side, Both of us weren't terribly hungry so those 3 things were more than enough.Guacamole: Overall, pretty decent, but it lacked a bit more lime which we were luckily provided with our ceviche and octopus. + They have homemade chips and not the store bought ones.- They were a little soggy, due to the humidity of Playa, but overall, it did not detract from the taste too much.Octopus: Very decent, although the veggies were kinda mweh so I didn't care for them too much.Fish ceviche: The fish was frozen, but other than that, it was pretty decent, we made our own mixture on the spot: Valentina(a slightly spicy sauce), one packet of Heinz ketchup and about 1/3 of mayo, add lime according to preference.On top of that, we had 3 bears and a Havana Club 7(the real stuff, not the one Bacardi makes for the US market) which was served in a regular glass and not a rocks/old fashioned glass.Which is my slight peevee as I am in the business and feel that a nice bar and a nice restaurant overall, should serve nice rums in a rocks glass.Overall, the experience was good-to-very good.Total bill = 600ish pesos(around 50$)+tip, for a total of 700 pesos(about 60ish dollars).Definitely worth it, but nothing over the top."

But while we were there enjoying our family beach time, out of nowhere this topless lady came out of the beach, like as if she was not topless, but of course she got lots of stares and a few giggles here and there, because it is a public beach, I was very shocked to see that, thank goodness my 8yr. old daughter did not see her."

And Mamita's should thank the Almighty He isn't making any more beach, because location is the only thing this overrated, self-impressed \"club\" has going for it.The lounge chairs ($3 or more each depending on how much the guy thinks he can get by you) are threadbare and in dire need of replacement. Make sure yours works before paying since many of the reclining positions are cracked. Another $3 or more for an umbrella. And the little drink tables (if you can get one) are also cracked and falling apart. I found it hilarious that the guy who came by to charge us for our chairs and umbrellas wanted a tip!!Drinks are as pricey as any you will find in PDC. $4 and up for a bottle of beer or bottled water; $7 and up for a cocktail. And waiters who are not the slightest bit shy about telling you how much they expect in a tip whether their service is fantastic or dismal.We got there about 10:30 and were at least impressed with the space provided between chairs and rows. Until about 11:30, that is, when the place filled up and the waiters began filling in every available spot of sand with additional chairs.Do yourself a favor. Skip Mamita's and head south down the beach toward the ferry terminal. There you will find many beach clubs with better service and better prices."

My guests couldn't stop complimenting the party location, Blue Parrot or the service we received from Miguel (client attention/ reservations), Daniel (WhatsApp attention/backend opperations), Abraham (logistic/operation coordinator), Daniel (support/ guide), Ysolina (photographer guide), and Julio (guide). Just reading this list, you can tell that they are attentive and organized. I mean, who is lucky enough that they get all these people making their events run smoothly. Just a few points: they took us to each event in nice, CLEAN vans, had drinks in van, helped everyone everywhere they went and photographed it all. I can't say enough!

To be honest I was a bit skeptical of this actually working out, but Miguel was there on time, with the van at our hotel, we made it to the port and got on the catamaran and had an amazing time. There were other people on the boat (we didn't choose the private yacht option) but it didn't matter at all, we had fun! The music was amazing, the water was insanely beautiful. We went snorkeling, parasailing and visited isla mujeres. To be honest the island wasn't that exciting, but we were having too much fun / drinking to even notice. The food we ate at isla mujeres was good, nothing too exciting though. Miguel was one of the best parts of the trip. He likes to joke with the girls and bother the bride (in a friendly way). He got us all wet even though we were still in our sun dresses which ended up being super fun and our dresses dried in about 2 minutes because it was so hot (and we left our dresses in the sun). Miguel reads people very well and can gauge who he can push/bother (in a friendly way) and who he can't. He totally got our jokes too. He was raised in the US most of his life, so we found it incredibly easy to relate to him. Definitely would recommend him for future parties.

We planned my friend's bachelorette party in February when it was winter in Minnesota because we REALLY wanted a beach vacation, but we couldn't get all 7 of us together until June. Unfortunately, the weather forecast called for rain the entire weekend we were there. Thankfully Miguel and Anny showed up as the bright spots on our vacation. They were extremely flexible when we asked to push the meeting time back an hour so we could finish getting ready. When they arrived at our hotel, they were friendly and welcoming and just what we needed after the rain. After taking our photos in the hotel lobby, they had champagne waiting for us in the van. We chatted and laughed the entire drive. The first place of the night was an open air bar where they made sure to broadcast that it was my friend's bachelorette party across the TV screens, had bottle service and a table available for us, and even did some crazy fire show with cinnamon. They blended in with our group really well. At the second place we got a table on a rooftop, which would have been perfect, but it was wet so we decided to try the third stop where we stayed the rest of the night. There were a bunch of other bachelor and bachelorette parties the same night.They knew all the good spots for a Saturday and made sure to cater the evening to our group. We never had to wait in line or worry about money. It was like the clouds had parted. The best part of it all. Our hotel had terrible food so they took us out for authentic tacos. I don't think we got back to our hotel until after 5AM. They were both very personable and I had so much fun dancing with them. I now consider them friends and would highly recommend them as tour guides. They are the best in the business!!"

He was friendly, helpful and on top of everything each step of the way. Our boat took us snorkeling, to a relaxing beach for lunch and into town to stroll around. Miguel arranged all the transportation too, which was super convenient. During one of the stop-offs, a few of us cut it way too close for getting back to the boat and Miguel literally sprinted through the town to find us and hurry us back to the boat so we didn't get left on the island. The boat was actually pulling away, so it was a really close call. Miguel totally went above and beyond! We may still be on that island if it weren't for him. After our cruise, he took us to a cheap, but fantastic local taco place. He has a lot of local knowledge in general, which is helpful since we had no clue what we were doing. I would absolutely recommend using Miguel to anyone!!!"

He was super friendly, accommodating and showed our entire group great hospitality. He went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our trip. He gave us great restaurant and night life recommendations while also setting us up with a fun day on the water on our own private yacht trip while down there. It included snorkeling, swimming food & drinks. He was also was able to help us find accommodations there at an amazing condo rental right in the heart of 5th Avenue where all the action is. That was huge because it's high season there when we went (Feb) and it was challenging to find a place that can accommodate a group our size that's also in a good location. The condo he set us up with was walking distance to pretty much everything that PDC had to offer.All in all, I highly recommend using Miguel and the services he offers. Sure you could probably plan it yourself and discover places on your own while there but having a great host will make your trip much smoother and also give you more of a local experience. You can't go wrong and will definitely have a great time!"

I'll be honest and say that I was a little weary of paying a deposit to someone I didn't know on paypal before ever meeting him, but I'm so glad I did! Please don't feel weary about doing this because he is definitely trust worthy. I found him by just googling \"playa del carmen bachelorette\" He got us set up to go party at night and best of all, he got us set up with a yacht for 15 of us girls. This was our absolute favorite part. The yacht was amazing!!! He was with us at all times when we went out to clubs/bars and on the yacht. We enjoyed his company, felt completely safe with him and enjoyed having an english speaking local with us to show us around. We went to Palazzo and Salsanero (I think) which is right across from Palazzo. We had a blast. If you are going to Playa del Carmen for any reason at all and need someone to set up any of your outings, Miguel is your guy. He is definitely a trustworthy find. If we are ever back in PDC, we'll be getting in contact with Miguel again for sure. Thanks for a great trip Miguel!"

I decided to book Miguel's club crawl service for my friends bachelorrete party after reading all the great reviews about him on Trip Advisor, and all proved true.. Miguel was prompt at returning my emails with answers to my questions regarding price and booking prior to my trip down there, . and also helped with booking other excursions for us as well. Miguel knows EVERYONE in Playa and it shows! We went to 4 hot night clubs and had total VIP treatment all the way.. No covers, no waiting in lines, awesome tables, and shots and bottles at our table as soon as we sat down! He was a total gentlemen, and made sure us girls were safe and well taken care of. On our other nights/ days there, Miguel without hesitation took us to other less touristy places for dinner, and went with us on our excursion assuring everything went smoothly... I would 100% recommend him and his service to anyone, and look forward to returning and hanging out with him again!"

We were a group of 10, and we had the best time thanks to his great job planning everything - from transportation to dinner to going out for 3 nights. He always made sure we were well taken care of, and we got to check out so many fun places. The whole trip was smooth and everyone had a blast, thanks to Miguel and his staff's great hosting. I would highly recommend Miguel's company for a bachelorette party, bachelor party or even if you are just heading to Playa for a weekend with friends. He has awesome suggestions for where to go and what to do and helped me plan a super fun trip for the whole group. Miguel knows everyone and everything in Playa, and once we arrived, he made sure everything was perfect. Playa has incredible hotels, great beaches, excellent restaurants, and a fun nightlife - it's a wonderful vacation spot for a group, and we got to see and do so much, thanks to Miguel! We will definitely be returning to Playa soon and hiring Miguel's company again! If you want to have an amazing time in Playa - definitely work with Miguel! He will make sure your group has a fantastic time."

On our second visit, expecting more of the same, we get something akin to 3 hours of Celine Dion, Oh My God!! The crowd was smaller and we, all, were having trouble staying awake.

Awesome place for couples, groups of friends looking to recover from the night before, and families looking to enjoy a day at the beach.Get there early or around 2 to get the best spots, closer to the beach. They have a minimum spend for different types of chairs and rows that you sit in, and it is basically just a consumption guarantee meaning you agree to eat and drink atleast that amount . My wife and I generally choose the 450 peso per chair section and easily get to the 900 pesos with food, drinks and dessert if little too much. If you aren't a big drinker, you will still enjoy the food including the fresh ceviche and seafood and regular Playa staples. There are tons of servers so the service is pretty consistent but sometimes when it is busy, your food can sit for a while, dont be afraid to speak up if something isn't right, they are happy to fix it. The sun creeps up on you so make sure to wear sunscreen and use those umbrellas. There are also some cool activities on the beach near KOOL like jet ski rentals, para sailing, snorkel tours and the obvious ocean swimming and the water is always pretty perfect! Highly recommend checking this place out for a relaxing day by the beach in downtown Playa Del Carmen"

After checking trip advisor (as we do...) we went to Kool Beach. Great choice, the place is fabulous. The way it works is quite fair, you choose your loungers, they are priced according to location and then the amount you pay is given to you as a credit for you to spend during the day on cocktails,food etc. Pool is very clean and the staff are excellent. Nice menu , great fresh fruit smoothies. The beach in front of this beach club is good. We did take a walk to The Blue Parrot Beach Club which is further down the same beach and found the beach there very inferior. Today was our last day at this beach club as we are off to beautiful Tulum tomorrow. We will miss it. Thanks to all at Kool Beach Club for making us feel very welcome everyday. Especially Allan who welcomed us and ensured we were always happy"

            "review": "Good spot for the day. Kool Beach Club was recommended to my husband and me by a few people, so we chose this location over the other beach clubs in Playa. It's definitely elegant, and the service is great. Plus, the money you pay for the beach chairs is actually an automatic food/drink credit. The lounge chairs are comfy, and there are umbrellas- which cover the whole chair except the feet, so if you want full sun, you'll have to lay your towel down somewhere. There's a pool, too, which we didn't use but which looked nice. There are two things to bear in mind: 1. If you spring for the waterfront chairs, please know they are NOT water's edge. They are the last row before the public beach--which extends from the last row of Kool's loungers to the water. So we paid for waterfront chairs but a few feet in front of us was a huge rowdy group of guys in the public area drinking, acting crazy and throwing beer cans around, so it wasn't the relaxing experience we'd hoped for. For that, the price we paid was not worth it. 2. The chair side service is great, but we didn't want to eat our lunch on the chairs, so when we went up to what we thought was the restaurant area, we discovered once we were heading toward a table that we'd crashed a private event. The restaurant area is actually upstairs in an enclosed room, and it's one sort of awkward family-style table where you can sit and order your lunch. I also feel like our waiter was a little annoyed that we went upstairs to eat. However, I must recommend my favorite aspect of the beach club: DO NOT miss the spa! At first, when the massage therapists walk around with info, you may think oh no, I just want to lounge here. But Vicki was so nice and the prices were great ($50 for an hour massage-- and you pay at the spa, not the front desk of the beach club) my husband and I decided to give the spa a try. Vicki had talked with me about an aromatherapy massage, and I'm so glad I chose it! She was wonderful- the oils were fragrant and relaxing. I can't recommend her enough. The massage is done on a table right at the beach, in the open, which was really nice. She was very professional and careful to protect my modesty, so if you're worried about feeling all exposed on the beach, don't worry. You are in your bathing suit, but she makes sure you are covered with towels, etc. also, she used soft mitts to brush away the sand from my skin, so don't let a little sand deter you. I loved that she placed warm towels while massaging, and when the face area of the table became uncomfortable, Vicki placed an extra towel around my head to make sure I was relaxed."

It was raining on and off that day and they even helped us move our stuff inside just in time before we would have gotten soaked. Then after it was done moved us back outside. That happened twice! They were great. The next day we went.. Not so great. Our waiter was TERRIBLE. The way this place works is you pay for your seats and that gives you credits for food and drink there. It's pretty good deal of you have a good waiter. He was so terrible we had to flag someone else down to take our order and they helped us and told him. You would think this would mean he would pay more attention, actually he paid less attention. If we were able to find someone else to help us, we could get some service, otherwise we would just go the bar our selves. It got so bad we left with credit still on our account, and it was only 2. So this place is a bit of a hit or miss depending on who you get. Drinks are decent, but very small. Food is decent as well. Not bad, not great. Great beach though! And comfortable chairs"

Still a much better value and less pretentious than it's neighbor, Mamita's."

I will confess though that my cocktails were watered down and I would probably stick to soda or water or beer next time. Not the best cocktails, guys.

You pay an entry fee of $500 pesos per person (some hotels like ours had discounts so it was just $250 pesos) and less for kids or under 5 free. The cost of the entry counts against food and drinks so if you have breakfast or lunch then use of the club is practically free. Lots of water activities around- jet skis, banana boats, parasailing. Good service although the runners work hard and are sometimes hard to catch but all friendly and want to make you happy. Had a good massage there too and well priced. Only cons would be that the cushions on the chairs could be better- kind of get dirty and moldy in heat and sun. Also bathrooms could be better."

We each paid 250 pesos for club access, which seems steep at first, but when you consider what this gets you it soon became more than worth it. The 250 pesos is basically a tab that you have to spend at the club, on anything you want. We ate lunch here, rented 4 loungers and had drinks throughout the day. We had access to their bathrooms, showers and changing rooms, as well as free wifi all day. By the end of the day when it came to settling what we owed above the 1000 pesos we paid between us, it was barely anything! It was almost like buying lunch, then getting free loungers, wifi and changing room access for the rest of the day. Perfect! The beach itself was really nice, but suuuuuuper busy. Easily the busiest beach of any we went to and I was happy we weren't staying in such a busy area when we went to Mayan Riviera. Nothing particularly outstanding about the beach, it's more of a party vibe if that is your thing, but for us not so much."

Some people paying $20-$30 per chair are places way in back away from the beach?  My husband and I went VIP to be right in front of the beach. If Mamitas (which I like better) is full, you can pony up and come here to get some expensive front row beach loungers. The Loungers are very comfortable.  The service was pretty good. They do not have any hot sauce though. I asked for some and they kept telling me that have it, and just not bringing it and brushing me off. The food here is good!!  If you're looking for a more empty place all to yourself, for the most part, this is it. Prices are so high with food and drink minimums that you can really hear the crickets chirping in the background.  Not sure what warrants the price, considering the restrooms are yucky, especially compared to the simply immaculate ones next door at Mamitas. Simple math, they need to lower their costs by at least $10 per chair to bring in more business. Prices are anything but KOOL.  We had a lovely day here. I would go back again. They just do need to change some minor things and, for god sakes Update the scary bathrooms. I had to pee in the ocean because I wouldn't step foot in there! "

The one day that we sat in a different section we were much less happy with the service. The staff was friendly, the bathrooms clean, and very accessible from the beach. The best part was that all of our fees for the use of the chairs, umbrellas, and facilities went towards a credit for our food and beverage. There was essentially no charge for the chairs, etc. as you used it for food etc. We were not able to use all the credit at the club, so we were able to use it towards our dinner at one of their five restaurants on 5th Avenue. What a great value!! We can't wait to come back again, and see our favorite waiter, Michael!"

But the highlight of our trip was the day we returned to visit Kool Beach Club. The management and staff took SUCH great care of us. Our servers Jesus and Blanca with the assistance of Angel were nothing short of INCREDIBLE! Not pushy, but right there should be need anything!Jesus was so appreciative of us when we left. The manager went above and beyond to accommodate us, just like the staff did when we married. The chef is amazing and again, delivered an incredible meal. The drinks came quick and you actually got a nice buzz, unlike some other places. The DJ is always spinning music at the right noise level. The massage I received was the best massage I have had in a very long time! I will update the review once I find out her name! Wow! And what a bargain price. I could never get a massage like that in the USA for 50-55 dollars! I would have gotten more, but family was waiting on me !They are trained massage therapists and the quality was top notch! I just can't say enough!If you are in Playa and want to get away from the hustle and bustle come here! The beach is amazing and you will be pampered!"

Full use of facilities on premise for the day - pool - bar - food. The price you pay is then deducted from food / drink you order - ie: we paid $25.00 per chair and all the food and drinks we had are deducted until you reach $0.00 overage pay at end of day. Overall we were very happy with our choice. VERY attentive wait staff - good food and drinks - no pressure but they were always there to help and get you anything you wanted"

At first it may sound expensive however, when you take into account that your drinks and food come off of your chair rental, it's actually a reasonable day at a serviced beach. I think it's important to mention that you need to go to the reception to book your chairs as you may find that the spots you think are open are already booked by someone else. Also you can only use the facilities if you have an arm band as proof of payment."

Even though 550 pesos/per person seemed a bit steep, when we learned that money could be \"earned back\" through drink orders and (good quality) food, it turned out to be a good deal. The day we were there, it was too windy to put up the umbrellas (and the blowing sand had us wondering if we'd made the right choice) but by afternoon, the winds dropped a bit and our server set up our umbrella, a good thing because the clouds disappeared and we would have fried in the sun. We were in the second row and it was great for people-watching too."

It's convenient, fun, very reasonably-priced, and the staff is fantastic. From the time we arrived, everyone made us so welcome, and they helped us with everything we needed. It is literally almost impossible to even try to put up your own beach umbrella without one of them trying to help you. There are several other options on the beach, but Kool has the best location, music, most comfortable chairs, and the food is awesome. A few *pro tips:-when you arrive, ask to be in Blanca's section (one of the servers). She is unbelievably awesome - so nice and accommodating, we literally hugged her goodbye when we departed on our last day. Ricardo (another server) is also super nice and attentive -try to arrive early if possible (before 10:30am), but this isn't totally necessary. However, getting there early will allow you to get the best chairs on the beach (we were in town during Semana Santa, so the whole town was especially crowded)-food and drink minimum - when you arrive at the club, you pay an amount that goes fully toward your food and drink minimum - so if you're going to eat/drink the amount that you prepay for, you essentially get the chairs for free - it's an awesome deal-food - order a shrimp and steak quesadilla (not on the menu), get a side of guacamole, pico de gallo, french fries, and habandero (olive oil with roasted habenero peppers). Put all of this together in the quesadilla, and enjoy one of the best bites of food in toda la planeta-drinks - the strawberry minto mojito was one of our favorites"

However we couldn't use umbrellas because of the wind, yet we could see the resort next to us using winds. There Was no wind and people kept complaining to the staff. Staff said the umbrellas did not have adequate anchors so whatever. Food is just okay as are the drinks. Obviously a tourist trap so will be paying more for food and drinks Than you would at other nearby local restaurants. Did not like being hassled for a 15% tip. Either add the tip automatically or let people tip as they pleased. I also only tipped on the amount above the chair fee (accidental) and he changed my tip to cover the total without explaining it and with already sliding my card."

Quick note, the only Beer that we were allowed was, Corona Light. Again if you want any other beer you must pay for it. The seating for us because its part of the hotel are situated in the last 3 to 4 rows. All have umbrellas, and the lounge chairs are what you would find at any other resort....if you want to sit on the cushioned chairs, or Beds, you do need to pay extra. You will receive an assigned seat...no need to run and find a chair early in the morning... Service......there are 2 people there that we were very happy with....A great big thanks goes out too, Victor, and Blanca. they made our stay at the Kool Beach Club very memorable. I say this you treat them right, $$, you get the service, and the smile.To the Kool Beach Management, Victor had told me he had only started a fews before, do not loose him, him like Bianca, are servers, that deserve to be you #1 go to people......Thank you for a wonderful time, and WE WILL see you again......"

He checked on us often and was very quick to bring whatever we needed and took a little time to get to know us making a friendly connection. We went a second time and choose the same seating area. Israel recognised us and greeted us but was working a different section so brought us over to introduce us to our new runner.

All food and beverages were additional cost. Once you pay, they are your seats for the day.Pluses: Very popular area with a nice stretch of sandy beach, not rocky or covered in seaweed.If you love to people watch, the front rows are the place to be. The pool area near the rear appears to be for more of the party crowd and is somewhat louder.Security does a good job of making sure that the public does not bother anyone in the marked off area.Lounges are comfortable and towels were provided. This place is very popular with people from Latin America, and other areas of Mexico. Being from the US, we really enjoy being in the minority and immersed in the local culture. It definitely helps to know how to speak some Spanish here.Minuses:Service can be excruciatingly slow. Waited for over an hour and a half from ordering lunch till the food was delivered. Although, it was very busy at the time. Each individual staff member seemed to have too big an area to cover. Sometimes they would ask if you needed anything a few times in a half hour, then wouldn't ask for an hour or more. They were all very friendly. It would be more efficient if they had some kind of table flag to let them know that you needed something or had a tablet to order food and beverages with.The food was ok. Nothing of the quality that the numerous restaurants in Playa serve. It appeared that several of our meals had sat under heat lamps for quite awhile.Some things are good, others are poor.

We chose mid level which was three paced lounge chairs with umbrellas. Came to just under hundred dollars US. OK to use credit card. The rest of the morning and afternoon you work against the credit you have. So for 2-3 drinks per person plus a fresh lunch of seafood you basically break even. Pay a tip and walk away.

Let me say first: the pool is nice, the music is nice (even if this is not the place for people looking for a calm afternoon, music gets loud ...), food was nice too and the prices are good! unfortunately I had a really rude waiter, I changed sunbed and a colleague told me it was ok, but then they got confused what certainly was not my fault and tried to make me change back to my first sunbed. I didn't want to - and after that the waiter started to ignore me. When I wanted to order I had to tell someone else and, that was the worst thing: I asked for the final bill, gave him the money and he was telling me angrily: I want my tip. Is that possible?! I was so shocked that I gave him my coins, he took them without looking at me and went straight away without saying thanks or goodbye. it was my layt day in playa and I am kind of sad I spent it in this place :("

So within my 350 pesos I got a couple of frozen margaritas and a really amazing salmon and chips lunch. I did end up paying for a few extra drinks but I didn't mind because it was in an amazing location, the sea was clearer than anywhere else, it had a cold pool which was IDEAL after trapsing about getting hot and sweaty!

It's a large beach club, energetic music and three levels of lounger pricing. We chose to be by the pool for which was in my opinion the nicer area for 150 pesos per lounger. Sitting at sand level, the second level was I believe 450 peso section was so far back that in some cases you don't even see the water while on the lounger. The VIP section which is at the front is yes, close to the water, but it's also just behind the public beach and on a busy day, this area is crowded with people who have brought their own chairs and umbrellas. The food and drinks were okay. My daughters loved the pool and people watching. Our service was very good. We did agree that it was the most expensive compared to the other beach clubs we tried during our trip and for the extra money wasn't worth it. The bill was much higher because they added 16% tax and then we were told tip was not yet included. Interesting, no other bill we saw during our trip added tax on top. Still glad we came to try this beach club"

Whilst on the beach we carried out various activities i.e jet skiing, banana boating and all sorts to which we enjoyed.The DJ also played some really relaxing and up beat music to which helped the vibe of the whole place. I must also add that the workers did such a good job with tackling the sea weed problem, as this could've been a huge put off. We also really appreciated how friendly Ubaldo despite not ever being our server; he asked how we were to which we appreciated. You can tell the Kool Beach Club us trying to maintain an exclusive service to which I'm sure customers like myself appreciate.

The facilities were nice (showers, pool, restrooms, etc.) and the staff was attentive but overall I felt it was expensive vs. other facilities in the area. For the new to beach clubs, essentially you pay a price for a few lounge chairs and an umbrella and the price is returned to you as a credit for food / drinks. Makes sense depending on how much you will be spending.For our visit we opted for 2 lounge chairs on the second row so we could watch the kids play in the sand - 'deposit' was 900 pesos or $60. Throughout the AM we grabbed 2 sodas and 2 waters, then had lunch. Biggest problem I had with lunch was the food was mediocre at best. We had a caesar salad, Chef's sushi platter (terrible), chips and guac, and quesadillas. I had kept rough tabs on what we ordered and it was just shy of 900 pesos. When it was time to pay our waiter brought the bill and it was 1200 pesos and he not so politely reminded me that it didn't include tip. We ended up leaving with a final cost of ~1400 pesos or $90 USD.As a point of reference, the day before we hit a different beach club about 8 blocks south (don't know the name) and the same basic experience was about $30. Only difference was the facilities at kool were nicer but the beach at the other club was nicer, food was better and service was more down to earth. Depending on what you're looking for you may be better walking further down the beach."

The chairs you sit on are priced according to the location to the beach. Like Broadway show tickets the closer to the beach the more expensive. The people in front of you on the beach sitting on towels or chairs they took from home don't pay a penny. Since the beaches in Mexico are not private. So you sit in VIP at KOOL and have the beach in front of you loaded with people drinking beer, tequila and eating food...HA HA its true..they are the smart ones.The 500 peso you pay you get a credit toward food or drink but this allows them to force you to eat and drink at that club. The tip is not included and the waiters try to rip you off on the tip. Better you go to Mamitas next door at least its not a RIP OFF.Years ago KOOL was great...it was owned an operated by nice sweet people.Now KOOL and Playa have become a rude grab the Gringo money and run type of tourist destination. Its a shame that this small fishing village slowly being destroyed.Its called Chinga los Gringos. Which means we love Americans."

Arrived at about 1pm and was told to rent a chair for tanning is $450 pesos however we get $450 pesos of 'credit' to use at the bar/food throughout the day. We paid the money and ordered lunch and several bottles of water through out the day. Everything is overpriced however we didn't mind too much as its a great location. When it came time to leave we had about 150 pesos of credit left so the waiter bought us over a few bottles of water. He then proceeded to tell us that we needed to pay a tip $1800 pesos!!!!!!! When we have already spent $1800 pesos between 4 of us? I have never been somewhere and asked for a 100% tip. We ended up giving him 200 pesos and leaving. Disappointed as we felt it was so rude and really left us with a bad view of the place.My recommendation would be go to Mamitas as they charge $30 pesos for a chair for a day! "

The location was great, they were constantly cleaning up the pool deck.The menu was decent - lacked items for vegetarians/vegans but we were able to modify the sushi accordingly no problem. The service I cannot say enough how great it was.My only complaint - as a younger married couple with no kids - this place was very family friendly. But for families this placed rocked.Free wifi! You can rent towels with a deposit - which they will return to you for 20$ each. Or just bring your own.Bathroom are clean.Massage is available.

Ricardo (very nice) had a hard time with our English and went and got one of the other waiters. Ishmal told us it was 350 pesos each and I said how much in US and he said $30 near the beach and $20 further back. We selected two chairs further back and I gave him a $100 bill. Ishmal came back with a 500 peso note. I told him it wasn't enough and he said it was, so I pulled the calculator up on my phone and did the simple math, 100 - 40 = 60 times 14 (a bad exchange rate, but fair) which is 840 and I said, you still owe me 340 pesos. Ishmal said, no it's 25 dollars for the chairs, so I said, well then you still owe me 200 pesos. He said he had to talk to his manager. About 5 minutes later he came back with 200 more pesos.We had a nice afternoon in the sun and enjoyed some chips and guacamole along with a couple of beers. When we decided to leave, I called Ricardo over, (who had waited on us and did a very nice job) and I asked for our check. He said we still had a .50 cent credit on our tab. I laughed and asked him to bring us two more beers and he said, \"You'll have to pay cash for them.\" and I said it wasn't a problem. He brought us our beers and when we were half way through, Ishmal came back and asked if we were ready to pay, I said, \"Sure, what do I owe you?\" and Ishmal said, $200 pesos, to cover the tax and tip. Gee, what a coincidence! Now, I had already been tipping Ricardo for the attentive service he gave to my wife and me. I have learned over the years, that nice tips, make for nice service. What I don't like, is to be ripped off or taken advantage of. If you go, just be aware, they will scam you. Best of luck."

Our first evening in PDC we happened upon Zenzi during a stroll down Avenida Quinta and I was not impressed; it was a very small crowded beach and there were boats docked at the beachfront. When we actually set out the following day for our first beach adventure, I asked the hotel guest services rep which he recommended explaining that I had already seen Zenzi. He said since the most important part of going to the beach was the view, so he emphatically recommended Kool. I was not averse to spending a few extra pesos since this was my birthday trip. When we arrived at Kool we were greeted by a very nice employee who showed us where to check in. The individual in charge is named Carlos and he proceeded to show me where the designated chairs were for guests of AM Hotel. Understandably, they were near the back of the beach about 10 rows from the beach front and the 'nicer chairs and beach views'. I explained to Carlos that this was my birthday, I wanted to go first class and that, in this case, money was not an object. He offered me two front row chairs with umbrella in the VIP section for $1100 pesos and explained we would receive that money back in food and beverage credit. BEST. DEAL. EVER! The front row chairs were awesome and very comfortable and the views and immediate ocean access were well worth the investment. Service was very good until they got until the thick of the lunch service and it was understandably a little slow. They take your food and drink orders on a tablet and then inform you if you have gone over your original credit. This was such a phenomenal experience that we went back two days later for the same experience. Treat yourself and go first class!"

So we hoped.Once we got there it was no problemo. There were choices in three categories and sure, it does cost some pesos (350 when we were there minimum) but you can then use that deposit towards your food and drink. And, the good news is the drinks are cold and the food quite tasty. It's perfect casual lunch dining of all the usual favorites. Our deposit more than covered plenty of food and drink for us and we were happy to pay it for the nice relaxing day.The facilities are great, everything is clean and we had an excellent waiter who appeared often enough and at the end made sure we got our full money's worth with our final order to cover our deposit nearly down to the peso.The wifi is free - just ask for a code. Sure, it's not fast but just fine for emails and looking something up quickly.This is a good stretch of beach to walk on as well since it's not narrow like a lot of Playa beaches. Next door is Mamitas but that wasn't our scene - it seems to be more of a mess and maybe we're just too old for that scene. Next time I'd probably pay a little extra and upgrade to the wooden chairs. They seem to have nice cushions and are more comfortable so I figure I'd pay a bit more but just have another drink or two and cover the difference plus be more comfortable.You can also go here without towels - they will \"rent\" you clean towels for a deposit that you get back at the end.

Price for bed is a credit for food and drinks and you can spend the whole amount during the day. Access to pool and a decent DJ playing tunes on-site while you relax, make the day very enjoyable.The cheapest beds buy you maybe one cocktail, a couple of sodas/waters and a decent lunch, while for the Mx$550 credit you can drink two to three cocktails more. All in all very expensive compared to prices in town, and ludicrous compared to general prices for the locals/non-tourist areas.We considered lying on the sandy beach some days, but always ended up at Kool for the convenience of not having to go get lunch somewhere else, and for the sense of security of having someone watching out stuff whenever we went swimming in the sea.If you go, make sure to get Edwin, Elias, Ismael or Estrella as your waiter.

The food is even good especially the tuna tartare salad. The waiters were slow and rude. The craziest thing was the chair/lounger prices. $7 for a broken lounger at the back, then $13.50 for a few rows forward, $35 for the next grouping and $45 for the nice flat comfortable loungers at the front by the beach. The beds are $165 per day! Sorry, I'd rather lay in the sand."

We were told the last two rows farthest from the beach were 70 pesos a person. These were sold out. The next few rows were 350 pesos per person. About 10 percent of these were full. We were not willing to spend 350 pesos per person for a chair so we left never to go back to Kool."

They offered grapes, champagne, and party favors. with the open bar they served anything you wanted. Danijel the MC from Croatia kept us entertained was very nice and went out of his way to make sure we had a good time.The promotion manager Carlos did a great job!! talking to us about the event and kept an eye out the whole evening on us since I am allergic to lobster he wanted to make sure I did not get sick.

We rented sunchairs the first time and a sunbed the second time - I prefer the sunbed. When you rent a sunbed/sunchair you can eat or drink for an amount corresponding to the price of the sunbed/sunchair without extra cost at Kool beach club. If you exceed the price you'll have to pay the difference - I think that's a good arrangement. The staff is very hard working, polite and giving a great service.Kool beach club is located on Mamita beach which I consider much better than the beach stretching from \"the ferry to Cozumel\" in the south to Mamita beach."

Make sure that Alfonso is your Playadomo for a GREAT experience. The service that he and his team of waitstaff and runners provide ensure that your beach day will be top notch. Like others who have posted here, I can't say enough about his attitude, work effort, and the joy that he brings to the time that you spend with him and his crew.The business model here is that you pay upfront for the beach chair and umbrella, but all of that goes toward food and beverage credit. We prefer the second row of lounge chairs for about $1050 MX, which right now is about $80 U.S. This pays for us to have breakfast there, lunch there, and a few drinks, although we aren't giant booze hounds. The food is excellent - shockingly so, actually. The beach scene is wonderful, and the location can't be beat - our doing this gives us a great vacation.We've been at beaches around the world, and the Alfonso experience is special."

There were 2 beach clubs with service and chairs to rent. Kool's and Mamitas. We went to Kool beach Club as it had nicer looking chairs and more umbrellas. We had to purchase a package to sit in the chairs. It came to about $40 pp and you had to pay upfront. It wasn't really that bad a price because you get the $40 pp back in drinks and food. The food was really good. My husband had the grilled shrimp with garlic and olive oil with a little spice. It was served with rice and some rolls. I had the shrimp tacos with French fries. We would recommend this place except it took us about 1 1/2 hrs to finally eat. Just trying to get someone to wait on you was a chore. When we finally ordered it took forever to get. The same went for the drinks. We were there for over 4 hrs and only had 2 drinks each. The problem is we were talking to the couple next to us who said they were at the place next door (Mamitas), last year and the service was sooo slow they decided to go to Kool's this time. Maybe it was the holiday. I will try it again during the week and see if it's any better."

We purchased the two chairs and umbrella package $600 pesos, the price of the equipment was granted to as credit on the bar/restaurant, so basically we spent $600 pesos on food and drinks and got the chairs free, however you want to look at it. Of course the prices are inflated. But you dont cook as well as they do and you get a nice view of the best stretch of beach in town and music. The Kool Beach club is definitely cool. The grounds were well maintained for a tourist destination in full swing. The prices were very reasonable. We have been staying in playa now for several months and have been to most of the resorts and beach clubs up and down the main beach IN playa. This is in the \"young/hip/vibey\" part of playas beach area. Mamitas is located next door. The sound systems compete for your ear, that can get annoying. The sevice was generally good. As stated, it was in full tourist swing so naturally they were busy and those poor guys were sweating thier butts off toda running around getting drinks and food for everyone. We ordered two different fish plates. A salad and grilled fish. Damn... it was good. Everything felt very fresh. It was really good. Of course we got some drinks and a couple snacks and our $600 credit was finished. So you figure for $45 USD we got lunch complete with drinks, which is pretty close to normal in a tourist area AND we got beach chairs, showers and a bathroom. Which if you stay all day on the Sea, then its essential. The music was run of the mill top 40 until like 4PM and they turned on some light house music. Very relaxed place, pretty standard service, amazing food and drinks. I would recommend Kool Beach club if you 40 and under. Have some money to spend. Want a restaurant quality meal,. Like lots of other people around and you want to relax on a beach chair with some music, complete with bathroom and shower services. If you don't want to spend the cash or its not your type of place but the location is, go to the OXXO store within 30 meters of Kool and purchase your snacks and beer there and spend about 30% of what you would at Kool, bring your own cooler or get one and ice at OXXO. Get your towels and umbrella and park right in front of Kool for free and you can hear the tunes. But you get no service, no shower, no bano. Either way, bring your towel. At Kool Beach, they dont give out towels. Thumbs up for this place."

We couldn't believe how clear and blue the water was here-- and those powdery white sands! See my photos to get an idea of what it looks like. We also had a truly decadent lunch here-- which was a nice change from the taco stands we had been hitting in Tulum every day (which we did love, but it was great to sample some fine dining too). Our favorite was the seafood salad-- we could not stop eating it and ordered more. I loved the pina coladas too-- frosty and refreshing but not overly sweet.

How it works: There are many lounge chairs in many rows progressing from most expensive being first row getting less expensive as you get back expect for the large beds. IMPORTANT: When I say expensive its deceiving and we almost did not stay here as they tell you its $550 pesos per lounger front row. BUT what it really means is that you have a credit of $550.00 pesos once you pay against food, water or adult beverages. If you are staying a full day that is very easy to spend. If myself and my 72 year old dad can do it most people no problem. But if it is too much or your on a budget simply go back some rows to meet your needs.The chairs are soft and comfortable. The facility gives you accesss to a bathroom, showers to rinse, a pool, towel, music and good food. However the best part is the service.ALFONSO AND ABRAHAM: Caps to signify they are the reason I will be back in February. I am very particular and demanding about service. In fact, if you read most of my reviews I am tough to please in this area. These two managed to exceed my expectations. Any request we had was delivered with a smile. They ran to get stuff, they watched from a distance so not to bother us but then knew when to come engage and chat with us. We really liked how they treated us. I hope the mangers or owner realize how these two becuase as a business owner I can tell you employees like this are hard to find. Never once did we lack for a beer, a towel, they even moved the umbrella as the sun moved becuase my dad wanted shade. They learned our names as evidenced the next day when we returned and they ran to greet us and shake our hands. Cons: Minor but the massage people drove us nuts asking for massages. I finally asked our servers to tell them to stop. I know they must make a living but if I am relaxing I do not want repetative questions. They need to come up with a way to let guests opt out. Suggestion: Teach the staff to word the sytem better. We would have left if ALFONSO and ABRAHAN had not elaborated versus the person we originally talked to. I would say - \"The chairs are FREE. What you give me is a credit agreeing to spend money upfront on food, water, adult beverages throughout the day in return I will service you like royalty.\" If they hesitate I would say \"how many drinks do you think you will consume today, and will you be eating lunch\" then show them the total and get them in the right seat. Its a no brainer to stay here versus the chairs next door that charge you without a credit for food or beverage.Owner/Manager I would be happy to talk to you about this or even meet and show you what I suggest and in return all I ask for iss the same great service I received when I return in February. Ill be back and made a deal with ALFONSO and ABRAHAN. If you remember my name and provide the same service I will double my tip :) I hope they win."

The biggest thing this club has over many others in PDC is that the section of beach in front of it is impeccable. There's no seaweed, boats or anything. Just lots of room to swim and the water is outstanding. As for the club itself, we had to spend around $100 US each time we went, but this got us two of the nicest chairs on the front row of the beach. The $100 was not a charge for the chairs though, and we got to use the money towards food/drinks throughout the day. Both times we went we spent the whole $100, but that went towards several drinks each as well as two meals. The first time we visited was on a Thursday, and while the crowds were less our service was a little lacking. It took some time to get our drinks and food but we never complained. I'm not in a rush while relaxing on the beach. Ironically, the next time we went to Kool was on a Saturday and the place was PACKED but we got much better service. We never had to wait more than a few minutes to get anything ordered and our waiter was VERY friendly. Overall I really liked Kool. It was a great place to sit and relax, while also going out to the ocean to swim from time to time. Oh and they actually had a wifi signal all the way out of the front row, so if you need to check emails and such you can do that too. Good times!"

Went mid week, got there around 1:45pm...paid approx (going off memory) 600 pesos for 2 beach chairs/umbrella/table and got that amount of $ in credit towards food/drink. We had steak nachos, order of fries, 5 Dos XX for the 600 pesos. Our server, although I forget his name, was great...quick and friendly. We rented beach towels, which upon return, got our money back..used the pool for a little bit, got a free round of shots and tipped 20%. Left around 4:45, only due to rain. The beach is one of the best, water was clear blue, calm, and warm. Beach wasn't overly crowded. We had a great time and would visit again. Thought we got a good value for what we paid. Don't think we were overcharged, coming from Chicago, and wasn't pressured to buy/spend more than we should...and wasn't told what to tip either (like some reviews mention). Would party here again!! Music, if you like EDM, was great too!!"

We wanted to spend the day at the beach and decided to give this place a try, they have loungers and charge depending on how close to the beach they are. We paid $50 per person to be in the first row and got to use that credit for food and drinks (so basically, they have a minimum consumption fee depending on where you seat). We think it's worth it, well located and good food/drinks. The only downside is that service is very slow (even for a single beer) plus there is a massage service nearby and their workers passed by every hour asking if we wanted a massage, at least 8 people asked us if we wanted a massage! Besides that, it's a great place to spend the day, they have showers, bathrooms and lend you towels."

We also share the same barber and was glad to share my Bald Guyz sunscreen with him too. Danijel found my son a very nice Kool Beach t-shirt that he loves because of the World Cup logo.

I worked with Adriana Paz throughout the whole process, including choosing the meal plan and the set up for the event. We were so blown away by Adriana's professionalism, punctuality in response to my emails and requests, and overall work in making our wedding such a huge success. In addition, the food and service staff at Kool were top rate. We did not get a chance to taste the food before the wedding (we had travel restrictions unfortunately)- however I was totally blown away by the quality. It was outstanding- similar to what I would expect at a 1 star Michelin restaurant in London. We also chose the open bar option for our guests which was great. The bar staff were very accomodating and the entire evening went by very smoothly and was very organized. I would absolutely recommend Kool to anyone looking for a wedding venue but not wanting to be tied down to all of the costs and restrictions of an all inclusive resort. Our guests flew from Europe, the Middle East, the US, Canada and Mexico to be a part of our event. We decided against having our wedding at an all inclusive due to this (because we knew our guests wanted flexibility and some would not stay in the resort, having to pay a day pass fee just to attend our wedding.) All of our guests loved the atmosphere and set-up at Kool, and Adriana and the Kool staff were open to my suggestions for additional add-ons as part of my event. Absolutely outstanding experience with Kool - I cannot recommend them enough!"

They used to cost 60 pesos each, but now the price was 300 pesos included drinks and food.I asked if they had changed the prices, but the waiter denied that. Later we found out that there's high season for the tourists, so everything is even more expensive.It's just not worth paying that much. There are other beach clubs near by who's cheaper, better and have great food. I'd rather recommend Mamitas Beach Club. 90 pesos for two sunbeds and an umbrella.

The club had around 90% spare lounges and when we asked if could we lie on one that had more direct sun he said no and asked us to move back to our original lounge despite there being no one there. He wouldn't take our $20 note bc it had a tiny tear in it and when we asked for a fresh towel after being there for over 4 hours we were denied, despite spending the 950 paso plus. If the club were busy and many people were occupying the lounges I'd understand the no changes of lounges or the changing of the towels, but it wasn't. The food was average and the pool was too warm!

We just returned from our week long wedding celebration with just under 60 family and friends who joined us in celebrating our weeding at Kool Beach Club.We did not stay at Kool we only had our ceremony and reception there. First let me say Adrianna ( wedding coordinator) did an amazing job. We met with her the day before the wedding and she certainly put my nerves to rest. We reviewed everything and did the walk thru.The day of the wedding I felt very comfortable lettng Adrianna and her team do what they do best.After the ceremony was the champagne cocktail hour while my husband and I took a few photos on the beach.Adrianna had a timeline for everything and I feel she did very well in keeping it in order.I really need to mention her serving team. Our particular server was Diego. He was amazing in his service. Most of our guest also commented that thier servers were amazing. They never allowed us to have an empty glass and were very cose if we did need anything.Dinner - We choose the #2 Dinner. I have to applaude the chef and his team. The dinner was delicious even my kids enjoyed every course.From the Palm heart salad to the cream of brocolli soup and even more for the stuffed chicken.Location - To the locals its called Playa Mamitas. It's literally right on the beach.The Ceremony was a beach ceremony. I was a little dissapointed that the general public didn't move away from behind the palapa were we were married, but I didn't notice them until I looked at my pictures.Reception - I had 6 tables that were placed along the pool and my table was at the head of the pool. It was a perfect setting with plams trees and lighting and the much needed ocean breeze that came by."

Today we chose not to go for the buffet breakfast as we were going to be eating lunch at Kool Beach. We usually do one or the other and occasionally have the buffet breakfast and lunch. Today when we got down to the beach at 9:25 the waiter approached before my husband had even had sat down on the chairs. He said we had to purchase the package if we wanted to sit in the front row. I had gone straight to the towel/ticket kiosk to get the wrist bands and my husband had gone straight to the chairs. My husband was very surprised and came to tell me and I was already being told the same at the kiosk. I was talking to the manager already and was explaining that we were regular customers, had been coming for five years and staying for six weeks at a time and spent most of that time at Kool. I explained that we usually had either the breakfast buffet each morning or lunch if we missed the buffet. It made no difference to them how regular a customer we were. It made no difference to them that we didn't drink alcohol and could never eat that much food in one day. They demanded $495.00 pesos each for the chairs. We feel that if we get there early enough in the morning to get a front row chair then we should be able to. It should not be who can pay the most. The chairs in the front row are the same as the second and third rows therefore why should they be a different price? If the chairs in the front row are taken when we get there we have sat in the second and third rows and that is not the issue. The issue is charging a high price for the front row which has the same chairs as the second and third row. We had found the first change this year was that they were not giving out bottles of water and we thought \"oh well\". Then a couple of weeks ago they said they were starting \"packages\" and we could get a package for food and drinks and chair all included. We specifically asked if we had to take the package and were told no you can still get just the chairs and umbrella for the same price. Today we were told that we HAD to pay $495.00 pesos per person to have a chair in the front row. As my husband and myself do not drink alcohol it would be virtually impossible for us to spend that much in one day on food. We have generally spent most days at Kool Beach because it is only one block from the condo, they were reasonably priced and we generally have liked the staff and service we get there. Last year I had an injured back and was unable to walk any further than Kool. We feel the way customers are being treated this year is unreasonable. Loyal customers who come almost every day should not be subjected to treatment like this. We saw several couples approaching to sit in the chairs and walking on when told about the prices. The rates changing without notice and from waiter to waiter (we actually heard one waiter telling a couple that the rate was $525.00 pesos each) is not a good way to do business. I can guarantee that we will never pay $495.00 pesos each for a chair in the front row!!!I realize that many people will not agree with what I have written and that is fine. I just wanted to let people know what was happening at Kool."

I have used Mamita's for the past three years because the condo I rent was associated with Mamita's and frankly the chairs and umbrellas were free because of the association. The association no longer exists. Since I had to pay for a chair and umbrella this year, I thought I'd try \"Kool\" for a change.For $6 USD (at today's exchange rate), I got a lounger with a cushion and an umbrella for an entire day. I tipped the person arranging the umbrella for me another $1.50. (This totals 100 Pesos - 80 for the lounger/umbrella and 20 for the tip.) Not a bad deal.Unlike Mamita's, there was no pressure from the wait staff to purchase drinks or food. The staff stopped occasionally to see if I needed anything. Bottled water and standard drinks, i.e. margaritas and mojitos, were fairly priced. I normally do not eat at the beach, but I did try an order of regular nachos. It was about $6 USD. I have a healthy appetite and it was enough to feed 2 and came with extra hot peppers, etc.At the end of each day I paid my tab. A big difference between Kool and Mamita's...the staff brought me the check, went over ever item on it to ensure that it was correct. I paid in Pesos and my change was brought to me promptly each time, including enough change to leave a reasonable tip (I did 15-20%). Mamita's - more often than not, the check was not available or there was a problem with change, etc.The loungers with cushions were in relatively good shape. The beach at Kool is wide. And the water gradually gets deeper - no steep drop off point. The lavatories were also clean."

I recommed this place way better than Mamitas cause the staff is way more friendly and has a pool too :) Do not hesitate to visit this Kool beach club :)"

Once again (for the third year in a row), we have plunked ourselves down every day, for seven days soaking up the sun and friendly service here at Kool Beach Club. It's not as fancy as Mamitas, but way more relaxed. Do yourself a favor, pay for the padded/wooden chaise lounge chairs up front (about US$8 for the day) sit back enjoy the sights, beverage and food service with super friendly staff. Also included are bathroom facilities and a pool. The DJ starts about 12pm and plays not too loud or offensive pool beats. We usually arrive about 8:30am for a decent and cheap ocean view buffet breakfast (about US$10). Then make our way to our chaise lounges. Be friendly, tip well and these guys will really look after you! We've made great friends with the staff and mutually look forward to seeing one another every year."

It was not at all crowded when we arrived and we stayed by the pool on the beds and the shade was wonderful. The pool was nice, the music was great, and the service was good. Not too pricey food menu and the food was good. The beach was crowded but the poolside was right on the beach and had a great view of the ocean. The bathrooms were adequate and close by. Overall a very relaxing beach day."

            "review": "Bad Attitude and Poor Service vs. Great Location and Music. Maybe you will have a better experience, but I have been to Kool many times over the years that I have visited Playa del Carmen, and I frequently have problems there. Up until now I have tolerated it because I like their location and the music. However, I have spent quite a lot of money at this place over the years too, and I'm tired of their BS. I figured its only fair that I write this review. I think it's also important that I mention that I speak some Spanish: enough to politely greet my server, and competently order from a menu. I'm in another country, where English is not the native language. I'm not one of those travelers that thinks if I just talk louder and slower that I will somehow be understood. Furthermore, I'm used to being treated well by those in the hospitality industry, and I return the favor with my gratuity. Kool just doesn't seem understand that concept very well at all.   Bad Attitudes:  \u2022They have a policy that you cannot bring food or drinks into the club. This is understandable. They are in the business of selling food and drinks. However, I will sometimes have a single bottle of water with me, which I finish, or simply leave in my bag, and then order from their menu. I will usually stay all day, so my bill is usually a quite a lot of money by most people's standards. Consider that water is about $2 US, most alcoholic beverages are $5-$10, and the average food item is about $15-$20. It adds up quickly.  When I entered the club I had a half-finished bottle of water. There was approximately 8 ounces left. On this particular day I suppose they choose to make an example of me. When I went to the desk to rent my beach chairs for the day, the woman working there refused to rent me the chairs until I walked back to where I left my bag, returned to her with the water, and put it in the trash. This is pretty ironic, and hypocritical since they have signs all over the property saying something like this \"Water is a precious resource, please conserve it.\" I guess that only applies to their water. She had a very smug look about her too, like she had just solved some major crime by spotting my smuggled water and disposing of it. In that respect I must say she did an excellent job! Poor Service:\u2022My chair was in the sun, so I asked the servers to adjust the umbrella so the chair was in the shade. I was with someone who spoke Spanish, so there was no definitely miscommunication here. For whatever reason this request was simply too much for them handle. After a great deal of discussion between 2 of the servers. We were asked us to move to another spot if we wanted shade. This spot was further back on the beach, rather than the front row near the water. I have been to Kool, and other PDC beach clubs countless times. This is not an uncommon or difficult request at these clubs. They move or adjust the umbrella, and then I tip them, simple. I have never had them refuse such a request before. The 2 servers just couldn't be bothered, or were just completely incompetent at their job.  \u2022My server wasn't extremely bad, but he definitely wasn't good either. He just seemed indifferent towards us, almost as though he didn't want to be there. He was terribly slow. Again I found all this ironic, since it is my understanding that many servers in Mexico aren't paid a wage, but work for gratuity only. Understanding that, you would think that even if you are having a bad day, you be a good actor, pretend that it is the best day of your life, and the people you are serving are your new best friends: not at Kool. Location: \u2022Excellent in my opinion. The beach is big , the water clear, and the ocean floor isn't too rough on your feet. Many other parts of the beach are not as clean, and are very rough and rocky. Music: \u2022If you like electronic music you will love this place. They play it all day and it's a good mellow selection of tracks.  Atmosphere:  \u2022The club itself is well maintained, and comfortable, with generally clean bathrooms. Food: \u2022Mostly good to average. Sushi quality in particular is very inconsistent, ranging from average to poor, so I just avoid it.  I hope this review helps you."

            "review": "Kool Club is wonderful but BEWARE the jetskis.. I love the kool club at Mamitas beach in Playa del Carmen. The ambience is relaxing and all the services you need (beach beds, umbrellas, food, bathrooms, etc) are here for a small fee. The waters off the beach are very clean and the beaches themselves are constantly being cared for. A relatively new phenomena at Mamitas beach is that the jetskis going back and forth along the beach drive VERY close to the shore. So if you want to go in the water more than about 5-10 meters (that is up to your waist) be very, very careful because the jetski drivers dont seem to care who they might run over. This is a disaster waiting to happen. I was at mamitas today and the jetski driver was screaming at all the swimmers to get out of the water. THese drivers used to go out far enough so that you could have a relaxing swim and even snorkel (beautiful fish in these waters). NO MORE! Too bad the beach club cant make these jetski operators go a bit farther out so that everyone can enjoy their time at mamitas-sun bathers, swimmers, and jetski fans."

I was turned off because you have to pay 80 pesos for a lounge chair with padding or 50 pesos for a regular lounge chair. On top of that a bucket of 4 beer is 160 pesos where other clubs offer 6 beer for 150 pesos. The massage people attached to Kool will come around and keep asking if you want a massage, which I found annoying. But you can't put a price on the experience. The wait staff are very attentive and funny. The food is excellent and the music is not blaring. All the locals plunk down in the sand in front of you, bringing their coolers full of food and beer. Everyone is partying and having a great time. You get caught up in it and at the end of the day you say that was fun. Have been there several times and Kool is not disappointing. It just might be my most favourite beach club."

When it came time to choose a place to enjoy the beach, we choose Kool Beach Club each time. The prices are similar between the two, but Kool has a food menu that's just a bit more upscale. Kool also has wooden loungers on the first two rows (the main reason we went with them) and these are much more comfortable. In my opinion, the beach in front of Mamitas and Kool is the best stretch in Playa hands down, but the downside to this is that it can be a bit more crowded in the afternoons. Overall, we enjoyed our time here."

They had a huge stage on the beach with various djs playing house music. Great vibe. There were beach beds and lounge chairs. Small modern pool surrounded by beach beds as well. im not sure what this place is like when nothing is going on but, with an event going on there was soooo many people socializing, drinking, partying. Just having a good time.

During our next visits, this impression was pretty much destroyed by our next experiences: most of the time we were more and more ignored by the staff, so ordering food or drinks could take up to half an hour to get only two beers. During our last day in PDC, we decided to give Kool an other chance. We'd better not have done that. we were not only ignored by the staff, we waived at crew members to order something, they glanced at us and walked on. It took 45 minutes to only get a menu. besides that, there were a couple of Mexicans with their own (irritating) music. When we kindly asked a staff member to ask those boys to put down their volume, his reaction was 'Mexicans are like this, i cannot do much about it'. That was the straw that hit the camel's back, and we immediately took off, and did not pay the tip they already put on the slip. After reading the other reviews here on TripAdvisor we learned that everyone who stayed at the Hotel Aventura Mexicana had the same experience. THis hotel provides tickets for free beds at Kool. At Kool, you get a light blue wrist band, and you pick a (plastic) bed of your choice. But it seems that this blue wrist band is also a sort of sign for the staff to reduce service to an absolute minimum. I really wonder why.... after all, this offering make people come several times to Kool (we often saw our fellow hotel guests at Kool), so this offering should be a great opportunity for Kool to make good money...but they don't seem to understand this. The first day we were at Kool and spend 700 pesos only in the afternoon. We tipped the staff more than the usual 10%...but no reason to 'cherish' us as customers. Shame.So, if you stay in PDC, don't let the first impression of Kool fool you. There are many beach clubs in PDC, so plenty of choice!And for those who stay in Hotel Aventura Mexicana, don't let the tickets for free beds temp you to go to Kool. Oh, last but not least, their prizes are high, in comparison to other beach clubs, and the food is not that impressive. We had much better meals at the beach, for much less money."

After we were finally seated (3 of us to 1 chair) I had to track down the waiter at least two different times to get service. But had I known they allowed topless sunbathing we would have sought a different beach club (traveling with 2 young teenagers). Also, the swimming pool & swimming pool lounge area doesn't allow children."

            "review": "Mostly good....with an exception (bill scam). We stayed at Aventura Mexicana April 5-13 which included free use of the KOOL beach club's 40 peso loungers. As this was just a lazy vacation (and a very hot and humid week) my husband and I spent about 4 hours every day at KOOL. We have used this beach club before (in December) so I was familiar with it. We had wonderful servers every day. We tipped very generously (usually 50%) because first of all, our loungers were free and that is an 80 peso value for the two of us right there and the service is spread out over a number of hours and I just don't think the 20-30% works in that situation. Anyway....day one was just beverages, bill was 140 pesos and we tipped 80 pesos. Day two we had lunch and when the bill came there was a 10% charge on it. I asked if this was tip included and the server said \"no, that is for the bartenders and the kitchen, my service is not included.\" I told him that had never happened before and he said they just never told me. Well, I knew that wasn't right, but didn't make a scene and still tipped him 150 pesos on top of that because he really had been a very good server and of course they are standing over you watching as you are figuring your tip. Days three, four, five and six we also had lunch and no service charges were added to any of those bills (again, really wonderful servers). Day seven we get the server from Day two, who had cheated us. First thing he asked was how many days we had spent at KOOL. We told him we'd been there every day and he knew right away that we remembered him and what he'd done. Well by then I was really stewing over this and how to handle it. During the course of the day he pretty much stayed away from us, just stopping occasionally to see if we needed anything. When we were ready to leave and he brought the bill I asked him how he was able to add that charge onto our bill on Day two. For awhile he played innocent and said that was procedure. I told him NO-ONE else had done that and maybe we should talk to a supervisor to see what the true procedure was. Then he said \"Oh, you want to get me in trouble\". And I said I really kind of would, because we had gotten such great service at KOOL but his little scam left a bad taste over everything. Eventually he was apologetic, but the bad thing is I don't think it will change anything. I think some servers there may very well do this randomly. I'm not sure what made him think we looked like suckers. This was our 15th trip to Playa, so I'm kind of offended that we did look like suckers. But I also think it's pretty dumb to risk that scam with people who have free lounge chairs from hotels and therefore will more than likely be down there more than once that week. I'd go to KOOL again because really most of the servers were really great, but if I was ever presented with a bill with any surcharge on it I would have them remove the charge and then I would not tip the server. Maybe over time it would hit them in the pocketbook enough to teach them a lesson."

By the time we left at 3pm it was packed. The bathroom was also in poor condition around this time. It hadn't been cleaned in a while, one stall was a complete mess and many stalls were missing toilet paper at this point. We ordered several drinks and food which was ok. The mixed drinks barely had any liquor if any at all in them. The strawberry margarita seemed to be crushed ice with Flavored syrup and water. When removing the food from our table our waiter dropped my pina colada which was half full. When I asked for a comped drink since he dropped it he said he would have to ask his manager. When the manager came he said that the waiter told him there was only a small amount left in the cup. This was totally untrue and I no longer ordered any food or drinks.I remained for a few more hours because the chairs and umbrella were complimentary as a part of our hotel. I went to another beach club the next day which was more secluded."

I requested a lounge chair be brought down from the platform to an open space located on the bar level to get more sun rays and the staff willing accommodated. The music was very soothing (slow to mid tempo) playing remakes of classic songs from unknown artists which was very relaxing. to my surprise, around noon they start playing techno music and it got louder. thankfully i had my own tunes to jam with to block it out. The entire facility is modern and hip with the exception of the bathrooms, which were dark and slightly creepy. David and Ren\u00e9 were my servers the first day, then Ernesto, Asterio and Wences the days following. All very attentive and even rotated my chair and umbrella to follow the sun without hesitation. I got a massage on the beach and it was fantastic. Didn\u2019t catch his name but he was a younger male, perhaps in his twenties. I never go by the recommended tip on the bill and always tip above and beyond if the service is impeccable, and it was!! Also, never haggled by security and would have given an excellent rating, but I loathe techno."

When you get your bill at the end of the day the tip is automatically added to the bill as recommended tip. When you pay this without adding an extra tip for your waiter he will chase you down and ask for the tip.When you point out that you paid the recommended tip he will complain that it is shared with the cooks and others and he should get extra, if you don't give him more he will get pissy and give you nasty looks when you go back.

I had planned to go to Mamacitas but I took a look at Kool next door and went there. Was glad I did! First of all, Kool had lounge chairs that had huge padding on them and huge umbrellas. (You could also get a day bed with canopy or just plain chairs - not sure of cost) $14 for 2 padded chairs and umbrella for the day. When we got there it was pretty empty - great for us! Chose my chair and parked...the waiter came over and introduced himself and said he would take care of us for the day. He was awesome -Excellent, excellent service! The funny thing is - they have a nice bathroom and a guard who guards it like Ft. Knox. If you don't have a wrist band - you don't get in..I loved it! I was there in November and they were resurfacing the pool but who cares - the beach is it!! Nice, wide, white sandy beach. We had some great guacamole and chips and some drinks for $21. On the internet when I looked at this place I was worried it would be a loud party place but it was so quiet and relaxing..We had it pretty much to ourselves most of the day. Was with my mother who doesn't like crowds or loud music and it was perfect. A large group came after lunch but didn't stay long. (Looked like they were from an excursion that got some beach time) Tons of shopping a block away. For you cruisers, walk down the beach to right past 'The Royal' and walk up the street about a block and catch a cab back to the ship. Also, none of the pushy beach vendors there - the beach police don't allow it..Very safe - easy great day! I will be back! BTW...about a 20 min. ride each way. Cab was $15 each way but if you know what time you want to go back you can book a round trip for less."

On our last night in town, the police saw us on the beach outside of your club. They told us that the beach was closed (which it was not) and that we would be arrested unless we withdrew $200 USD out of the ATM outside of the Kool bar, and paid them. After we discovered that the ATM was not working, the police drove away, leaving us with two security guards who were stationed at Kool, who had seen and heard the entire exchange. The Kool security guards told us that we could not leave until we paid them the $200 USD, even though the ATM wasn\u2019t working. They refused to speak to us in English, and refused to respond to anything I said in my limited Spanish vocabulary, unless I said something about paying them. I was terrified, and asked if they could accompany me to another ATM (toward 5th Avenue) so that I could give them the money. They refused, and told us to follow them toward the bar, which was closed and dark, out of the lighted area where the ATM is located. I begged them to please let me bring them the money en la ma\u00f1ana. Finally, they agreed and let us go. I did not bring them money the next morning, since our flight left from Cancun early, but I think that it is a horrible, shameful thing to intimidate and take advantage of two young tourists. I hope that my sharing this experience might prevent this from happening to someone else. I enjoyed my time in Playa del Carmen immensely, until this incident. I hope that this can and will be the last time young travelers are put through this by the Kool staff."

The beaches are free in Playa so there really is no need to go to a beach club unless you want to pay for a chair and have an umbrella for shade. As both were important to me, pay we did and it was cheap! Our hotel gave us 10 peso discounts for the 40 peso regular chairs that were perfectly comfy. Why pay 70 pesos for a \"bed\"? The wait staff was pleasant, helpful and courteous. We ate at the restaurant itself and also on the beach. Most days the music was pleasant and soothing. We tried Mamitas one day, but couldn't find a free chair and didn't feel overly welcome there. We liked Kool much better."

Once in the club you had to manoeuvre through narrow corridors filled with bodies trying to push through to the actual show, shots and drinks were handed out during the shove - fortunately! We finally got to the main show and the room was much smaller than expected. There is seating all around the room at an elevated level for VIP and this was jam packed!!! It certainly did not make you feel like a VIP and we actually seen several people complaining and leaving the club, due to this issue.

I can't believe that CNN rated this a top travel place to visit!?1. This place is super crowded!!! To the point that people are pushing and barely have any place to walk. It's like sardines fest. It's called a nightclub with no place to dance at all!!! IT's too bad because they do play some good music. There are three levels to watch the show, the ground floor, with bottle service area where people are seated, the second floor with more tables for bottle service and the third floor for standing.2. I do not think this is worth $75 even for all inclusive. We paid that much to watch the show at the standing area on the ground floor. We got there pretty early so we were happy that we were able to get a spot by the elevated bottle service area, but as the crown came, it has gotten really congested and overly packed. We can barely move. We barely got drinks as it was so hard to order anything from the server due to the noise and the pushing crowd. So overall we were only able to get 2 drinks each for $75!!! Not worth it.3. The performers were amazing! The entire show was fun but was really hard to enjoy. In addition, the amount of confetti they use is highly excessive and dangerous. the mix of alcohol and paper confetti in a super crowded room just screams red flag to me. The worst part of this place is that there is only one exit with a non-visible exit sign! It's crazy dangerous!!! It was pretty upsetting to me, I feel like I got ripped off because we stood for 5 hours fighting the crowd for the spot we are standing on while trying to enjoy the show. We can't even get drinks! I don't think the whole experience is worth $75, but if you really want to experience this place, I suggest you pay for a bottle service. But again, I don't think that this is worth $100+ for an average show. I might as well spend my $100+ to Cirque du Soleil which will give me comfortable seats and enjoy high-end acrobatic show. I was glad I was able to experience Coco Bongo but I don't think that I will come here again."

We got there for 9.45 having getting a taxi there as the coach would be leaving later than we though.Once in, a drink was given although I still no idea what it was? You were shown through to the club area and I was surprised how small it was. We were shown to the second level and I thought we had paid for a table! Nope we ended up on a stool with a ledge, not happy, I asked to be moved but we were told tables were for groups of four.My husband must have had the worse seat in the place, all the greeted him was wooden posts!! For a \u00a3130 I felt we had been ripped off. Your much better if you can afford to go VIP but again that doesn't compensate for the size of the club.We then waited 1 and 1/2 hours before anything happened. Once it did it started to buzz. The highlight of the night was the dwarf in the entertainers group, had me inhisterics abousoulty brilliant. Never laughed so much the entertainment was good but I'm not sure about the boast of being better than Las Vegas??? Shows in London take some beating too. But we enjoyed it all the same. Then there were the bits in between the entertainment that, well if your an exhibitionist, you would be in your element and believe me people certainly played up to the camera's, boobs and all, again that was funny at times as some of the punters thought they were the entertainment. Drinks were nothing special, in fact only had 6 weak vodkas, service was iffy at that.1 toilet for ladies and 1 for gents, for a club that busy, not good. It was something we had to do while hear but I wouldn't go again.Jim Carrey, it needs more material in it for the show element. ,"

It's $25 cheaper than Gold and you get ALL the same perks as Gold, except you stand on a terrace and not sit at a table. You'll need energy to stick out the night, but your drinks are all free and if your server is as good as ours was (Juan) they'll just keep replacing them for you. The only issue is that the Silver ticket was only for a Tuesday, so it wasn't at it's busiest. Our terrace was quiet and quite cold with the air con, so I'd imagine busier would be better"

We paid $130 each for the gold package where you skip the cues in and get a table with a waiter and all inclusive drinks all night. We had great seats where we could see all the acts but to be honest most of the time we were on our feet dancing. Drinks were flowing, we had heard horror stories from people in our hotel about things they do to the ice so just to be careful my husband stuck to bottled beer and I made sure I asked for no ice in my drinks. All the acts were great, from Freddie Mercury, The Mask, SpiderMan, MJ, to musicals like Chicago. I was worried it was going to be a really long night as it doesn't stop till 3.30am but the first time I looked at the time was when the last act was over and this was about 2.45am. The night flew by. We decided to get a cab back to our hotel at 3am rather than waiting for the coach to come at 3.40am and then go round the other hotels. There are lots of cabs outside and it only cost us $25. This was a great night and I recommend people to go!!"

The show was great fun and I enjoyed every minute. It is totally cheesy but well worth the trip. The show is mimed, but is pretty well choreographed and there is a great party atmosphere.

There are short performances throughout the evening with music in between. Some of the performances were impersonators and some were dance performers. They were all really professional. I really got into the party spirit and even ended up having a dance on the stage at the end.Transport to and from the club was included in the price of the ticket. The only downside was the terrible hangover I had the next day!!If you like to party, Coco Bongo is a must!!"

But the VIP is just some stairs were you stand and have no space for dancing and the tables are really tiny. A lot of the eldest just stayed for 20 minutes and they left. The show is great and we had a lot of fun but I really don't recommend paying the VIP ticket."

We were promised (for the amount we paid) to be on one of the 3 or 4 levels of balconies, this was very disappointing. I do have to give Kudos to the staff in this facility as they made sure our drinks were never empty, they paid very close attention to this. For the show (from what I saw) looked to be amazing, lots of hard work on their part. I would love to actually see the whole show from a better view.

The downside is that it's really crowded, and pretty expensive even for the cheapest tickets for about 70$ (yeah there's a show, but it's still playback and lip sync).

If you book on line make sure you take copy of all your passports and credit card that it was paid on. Once in there it's so packed in, even in VIP you are squeezed up on the balconies, absolutely not suitable for anyone disabled. I was a little scared by it all but you could see security was well on top of everything. Do not even take a paracetamol with you, it will be confiscated along with selfie sticks.The show itself was amazing, a must see, the waiter brings your drinks to the table and as long as you don't have annoying people standing in your view it should be a great night.

I thought the show itself was amazing and therefore for that reason I say it's a must see!! HOWEVER, I was surrounded by sleezy men (mainly those on vacation too may I add), it was too overcrowded (I ended up finding a nice spot literally outside the door) and the quality of the alcohol was very poor. I also found the staff team very hasty and it was very annoying to have assistants constantly sweeping the floor during the show. Bar staff were very quick though I give them that. My advice would be to buy your own drinks/bottles when you get in there, or have a few nicer drinks before going in otherwise you may find the whole experience overwhelming!! "

We bought tickets direct from Coco Bongos (there is a stall open there during the day), as it is located not far from where we were staying and 5th Ave.Having had a look on their website, gold/VIP tickets had sold out for the night we wanted to go - however, at 150 US Dollars, we wouldn't have gone for them even if they were available. We bought standard tickets at 1,250 mexican pesos (half the price of Gold), roughly \u00a350, and were not dissapointed.We got there early, around 10pm, and were one of the first in, so got drinks and found a place to perch near the back (also managed to sit down here for a bit so was worth going early to get this spot). We had waiter service all night long and he remembered what we were drinking so kept us topped up frequently. A lot of other reviewers seem to think you have to have Gold tickets to get waiter service - not true. However, the quality of the vodka wasn't great - if I went again I'd probably stick to beer. Included in the price though so can't complain too much anyway.The show itself was fantastic - amazing costumes, dancing, singing etc - never seen anything quite like it!Overall I would definitely recommend going, but having read other reviews don't bother buying Gold tickets and get there early."

When a staff member ( the mask ) came over to me he felt I was cold but I was never offered to be moved even though we was one of the first people in and there was plenty of spaces but never got offered. We paid the gold membership so we could get our own seated area with our own waiter and we only saw the waiter like 3 times the whole night and got a stool on a bannister. Suggestion you shouldn't sit people right near the stage past the stairs it should have been for staff. Or if you going to, at least sit people that are first in more central first then fan them out.

We had a VIP table which includes a table and chairs with bottle service / set up and a very attentive waiter. I initially thought this was a show then thought maybe a dance club well, it's BOTH. the show starts and you watch and if you feel like standing up to dance, you do. There are no rules at CoCo Bongo. The girls like to stand on the bar and dance while the show is on but beware of the blast of air that blows up your dresses for all to see!!The cost for us was about $150 for VIP which was well worth the price. I've been to CCB 3 times and each time it's a little different and still a blast. You MUST go!"

So I figured this connected to the Cancun location, show should be good and same for the service. Well, It's been a long time that I've been treated like cattle and paid for it. As I had bought thru Rockstarcrawl and not the hotel, I wasn't allowed to goto the 2nd level with the people from the hotel I was from. I was on the main floor in a area everyone comes in. 2 hours there being bounced around like a pinball. All you can drink? 2 hours I was able to get 5 drinks, 2 got knocked out of my hand. After the 2nd time I left. If a fire marshal would seen the amount people in there, he'd say they are over the limit by 250-300. I've bounced in my younger years and I've never seen staff treat customers like this. Shows great, but if your treated like a second class person, that isn't fun."

We booked a night out to coco bongos in playa del Carmel with a coco bongo rep called NELSON *BEWARE*There's a few of them that come round to your pool to sell trips and the guy we booked with was called nelson.We were told prices start from $140 for standing tickets with open bar,Or you can pay $160 for a table or $180 for a table with a bottle of grey goose.We was unsure what package we wanted but nelson said its ok we could decide on the night.So the night came and we were picked up on time from the moon palace hotel, Nelson was there to meet us and asked what we wanted to do and how we wanted to pay. We went for the $160 option which was for 2 of us with a table and a free bar all night.We paid Nelson $160 and went inside coco bongos and had a great night..!The problems only started when we came to check out of the moon palace at the end of our holiday, moon palace said we had to pay an extra $140 ??? We tried to explain what the situation was but they were not able to see our point of view and we had to pay $140, so one night at coco bongos cost us $300 for two people.. We have been ripped off so I'm just wanting to let people know not to trust the coco bongo reps that come round your hotel pool...! Especially not NELSON..!!!!"

But you can get up with plenty of room to dance around and you can even go onto the main dance floor if you wanted or up on stage to dance in front of the whole of coco bongos! Once in a lifetime crazy experience that you just have todo when visiting Mexico, it will not be like anything you have ever experienced before I think there's something for all ages your not to young or to old to go there there's something for everyone. Do not miss it, and always ask the coco bongo reps rather than booking through Thomson!"

Coco Bongo sent a bus to our hotel to collect us and we were taken straight passed the long queue then taken to our 'seats'. My son has just turned 18 and was asked for ID as we entered, which was okay as we had it with us. I visited with my husband, daughter (25) and afore mentioned son (18). At first impression of entering the club it appeared a little grubby and we were worried. Our 'seats' were actually a kind of stepped bench where the man sits on the top 'shelf' and the woman sits in between his legs, as you can imagine this did not impress my son and daughter who did not sit like this my son stood on the back bench. However once the show started and the free drinks started flowing we didn't care! It was an amazing night! Dress in anything, there is no dress code. Prepare to be drunk but be aware that the shots handed out by the girls are not free. However the drinks from your waiter as a gold member are unless your drinking champagne or cognac. We left Coco Bongo at 03:30hrs and got the complimentary bus back to our hotel. The only disappointing part for us was that it was over so quickly!!"

We were shown to our seats really quickly - we had booked the Gold VIP Package which was well worth paying for as you get an allocated seat and all drinks included. We got a great seat directly opposite the stage but there was a row of people in front of us so we couldn't always see what was happening on the stage on the ground but we could easily move to a better vantage point. Yes, it was heaving and I definitely wouldn't have wanted to be down on the dance floor.

We went on a Thursday (Wednesday is Ladies night and apparently gets really busy). There were lots of security checks (a good thing in my eyes) before being taken to our seated area. We were up on the centre level so had a perfect view of the stage. We had our own bar waiter and we never once had to ask for a top up! The drinks were premium and all inclusive. I would recommend paying the extra for the Goldmember tickets as I've read some bad reviews regarding the bars and not being able to get served. The show itself was amazing!!

We had gold member tickets which I think are definitely worth the extra - we had brilliant seats which offered great views and were away from the crowds of people - although we went on a Monday so it wasn't too busy. Also skipped the queues outside!Another review mentioned the toilets - yes there is only one set of toilets but they were immaculate! There were two staff in there who would check the individual stalls before you went in.Waiters ensured the drinks were flowing and never made to wait for them.They take pictures inside with some of the characters which you can buy for $20. We bought the first one but wished we'd waited as a later one was much better Be warned its a long night - it doesn't finish till 4! So don't plan it before a busy day. Brilliant show!!"

The show is very very good quality, costumes are great and in between sketches are fun. The show changes a little bit every 6 to 12 months so they include the latest pitbull song or blockbuster movie so its ok to return every once in a while (but maybe not in the same trip). Waiters and personnel is nice and attentive. Regular drinks / alcohol are included and premium drinks are on the cheap side.

Prices differ based on the day that you choose to go. If you don't have VIP pay the extra $10 to skip the line!! Reps roam the local resorts and sell you tickets and transportation to and from the venue. Prices differ based on the experience. The least expensive ticket is around $60 if you want the GOLD or VIP experience then pricing starts at around $150. People pay top dollar once inside the club to try to secure a table (better known as a super small space that may or may not have seating so get there early and negotiate for your space) Drinks are included but you quickly realize that they are included b/c it's so difficult to get to the bar. With a table you get service for your drinks but of course you must tip your waiter/waitress. Overall I'm glad I went just to say I had the experience. I'm early 30s so I'm not a big fan of being shoulder to shoulder in the club and getting drinks spilled all over my clothing, so i'll pass on going again but I do not regret the experience."

            "review": "Great show, great atmosphere, great fun, but still room for improvement.. I'd been dying to come here ever since we booked our holiday to mexico.We booked through thomson so got our transport included.Gold member is definitely worth the extra.Pick up from our hotel was about 9.45pm and we had a lovely coco bongos rep member on our coach with us who sold beer and margarita's on the way for $2 to get you in the mood! great touch. He explained thoroughly the pick up time and place and what to do when entering the club. Gold member means theres no real queue to get in. You receive a welcome drink of vodka and cranberry juice, and then offered a shot of tequila, i wish i'd given this a miss. We were then shown upstairs to our seat & table. I was expecting a table with two chairs either side, however unless you get there very very early you won't receive this. Instead we were sat on a row on a bench squeezed in with many other couples and my boyfriend had to sit on the back of the bench, with me on the lower part in between his legs, and we were sharing a table with someone else! Not ideal when you want to talk to each other, take photos and dance, but i would just get there early next time. You do get waiter service with gold member. However although our waiter was great and remembering our order as well as many other people's, and was very attentive, keep an eye on this because you cannot be sure what is in your drink. I'm not accusing or assuming anything but just be cautious because i only had two gin and tonic's from the bar (which isn't unusual for me) and i am a dancer so as you can imagine was having a great time with the music and the show. The waiter was asking me if i wanted to go onto the podium to dance (they do this with girls in the interval and continually shoot the camera at their assets) however i said no. I was violently ill the next morning, i felt as though i had 20 drinks so you have no idea how strong they are or what's in them! However i would still do gold member as i went to the toilet and saw the queue for the normal bar and i am SO glad i didn't have to deal with that!All moaning aside, this was a wonderful night. The dancers are amazing and the aerial performers too, meaning you can see something wherever you are in the room. The different themes and tribute acts are great, the show really is perfected down to a T and i cannot fault it. The special effects, balloons, smoke and music are top class, like a club in Vegas. There is a smoking area on the 2nd floor. When the show finishes about 3am the whole atmosphere kind of slowly dies as everyone leaves rather quickly to get their coach. My advice would be to book yourself a taxi back however, as we were stuck next to a young lad throwing up the whole way home and the poor coach driver spoke 0 english, so maybe reps on the way home too would be a good idea. All in all a wonderful night, you will never experience anything else like it, i would definitely go again. Thank you!"

The performances in the air and on stage were completely entertaining. And for how many people were there, the waiter brought us drinks all evening. The only con was that a representative from CB brought us to the club around 930pm and then stand in line outside until 1045pm. Needless to say, it's a little warm in Mexico to stand in line for over an hour. Once inside, the show and music made you forget all that! Thanks to all the performers and wait staff!"

Paid quite a lot for the trip and as they said the bus will pick us up from the hotel and will take us back in the morning. When we arrived it was a massive row of people which they said a 45 minutes wait. But if you want to go in quicker you can pay an extra 10 dollar which we did. Then you end up is a building which have 3 levels. We went to the bar and asked for a drink then wanted to head upstairs to take a seat. Then they said we are not allowed to go upstairs only if we buy VIP tickets which will cost us an extra 100 dollar. There were 4 standing tables where we put our drinks down and we have been told not to use them either as we are not VIP. We ended up downstairs like herrings, very hot and crowded. So we headed outside but they didn't want to let us out first, they said they will give us a seat...but we were 5 of us. I'm not too sure what they were expect from us...seating on each other? ...Well we ended up taking a taxi back to the hotel. So being in Coco Bongo for max half an hour cost us almost 200 dollar.

Best advice is to get the bottle service so that you have your own spot and can see the show without being pushed around. Also, take some cash with you so you can take a cab back to the resort if you don't want to stay till almost 4am for a pick up. Can't wait to go and see it again."

As instructed my husband took photo ID and the credit card that he paid with to ticket collection point. Whilst queueing some young ladies were having trouble with collection being told having proof of purchas, e-mails etc on phone not good enough. Eventually they were allowed in after using Coco Bongo reps phone as the girls did not have internet signal. We thought this odd but were under the impression all would be OK for us. Unfortunately we were wrong. After showing his driving licence and credit card the rep then proceeded to copy them on a laptop scanner. When asked why we were told it was company policy in case of non payment. We argued that they had been paid 3months earlier and that they should not be copying ID. We were then told no admission if this was not done. As we were looking forward to the show we went in and cancelled the credit card the next morning. This caused a lot of inconvenience and great annoyance as we were worried about fraud or the card cloned. Once inside we had our handbags searched. I do not object to this as it is an essential safety precaution. But why on earth were my clear plastic rain macs confiscated? My friend also had her selfie stick put aside \"as it could be used as a weapon\". If true, then why were we served beer in glass bottles? Then we were shown to seating with limited view and told that we would have to pay more if we wanted to move. Our waiter was very attentive and regularly replenished our drinks. Unfortunately I had shards of broken glass in my drink and was told by another woman that she had had two drinks with glass in them. A glass had got broken and they hadn't cleared up properly. Extremely Dangerous. Now for the good things about Coco Bongo. The show was fantastic and very professional. Young ladies were invited to dance on a podium in break between each performance and were treated to having their skirts blown up exposing their underwear. Despite this there was a queue of willing volunteers. Would we go back? Maybe. But ALWAYS buy you ticket from holidayrep at yourt hotel or Coco Bongo rep who visit beach and hotels or the box office in Playa de Carmen. Tickets cost the same but you get free transport."

Our seats were side on near the stage so we lost some of the shows impact but had a bit of a backstage view. The show is mainly high level acrobats, and lookalikely performers with a dance troupe. Lots of themes - Superman, The Mask, Tron etc. It's good fun, lots of balloons and ticker tape and dry ice but don't expect Cirque du Soleil quality. It's very very loud. Show finishes about 2.30am Club closes around 3.30am."

We were a bit dubious booking this excursion and nearly didn't go when we found out the place didn't open till 11pm.We did the customary pick everyone up thing and then our guide took us to a bar, with free drinks at 8pm. It was boring and coach loads of people turned up doing the same thing. Then we were herded just like cattle - I checked to see if I had a bell round my neck - to a second bar for an hour and more free drinks. We were starting to think is this all worth it? We were sitting next to folk we weren't really interested in, some of whom were already on the booze wagon.Finally we were shepherded to Coco bongo. If I had known we could have booked this independently and turned up at 11pm we would have.What was it like? It's really hard to explain. Think nightclub, that every 10 minutes puts on a show - and what a show. The owner is Jim Carrey and that might give you some idea of the madness and mayhem that ensues. People come on stage, its three floors up - and either perform identical routines from films or musicals, others are look-a-likes who do tributes acts from Michael Jackson to Guns and roses. There's a touch of Cirque du Soleil at certain points too. Prepare to be amazed and wonder where 3 hours went.Tips - Only book the top VIP floor. you get to sit down, drinks are free and the toilets nearby. Down-side if you're disabled you won't be able to manage the stairs. They're steep and crowded all the time."

We again were told \"one minute\" and waited another 10 minutes and so on and so forth for the next half hour. After nearly an hour and missing almost the entirety of the show we walked back to the front to ask for a refund. We tried to explain that we paid for a table with bottle service and there was no table available as they just kept telling us to keep waiting with no end in sight. Since we weren't given any drinks or bottle or table or anything we were promised, we figured they would oblige to our refund request. Well we thought wrong as we tried to talk to employee after employee and manager after manager that all refused to give us a refund stating that our table was available even though none of them were actually inside to see that there were no tables available. Once the arguing escalated we were surrounded by multitudes of security guards trying to push us farther away from the door so nobody else would see what was going on. After over an hour of trying to argue with no offer of a refund we were forced to leave empty handed having lost $800 and given nothing in return. This place is down right criminal and will take advantage of you no questions asked!! I will never return and I suggest anyone thinking about going here to think twice before being taken advantage of by this very unproffesional business!!"

If you visit make sure you take some money for tips as they really do go the extra mile! Some of the acts we saw were Elvis, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Spider Man and of course the mask. Once the acts had finished they introduced the DJ and the place turned into a nightclub! When it had finished we went to the coco bongo shop where the prices were surprisingly cheap for good quality items, then some of our group went across the road for a kebab taco (apparently it was really nice).

Even though it seemed expensive & we weren't big drinkers, we decided to go along anyway.Our tour guide advised us to line up 1.5hrs before it opened to get a good viewing spot near the stage. They gave us balloons in line which was fun but it still took an hour to get in. They packed people in like sardines. We could barely move. There was only 1 bar open even though it was a Saturday night. The bar was so far away & so hard to get to we only ended up having 5 drinks over several hours. The drinks tasted like methylated spirits & we're sure it was some kind of home brew. The show itself was ok. I've seen better elsewhere. What really concerned us was that 2 of us suddenly collapsed & blacked out 3/4 of the way through the show. Considering none of us drink much at all (my last drink was over 1 year ago) & we are very careful to monitor our drinks, there was no way we had simply lost track of our drinks. We went from being a little tipsy to blacked out. Luckily our third friend was able to get help from some nice American boys to get us back to our hotel because we couldn't even walk! We vomited all night & I ended up with a black eye from falling. We have never been in such a state our whole lives from alcohol (we're in our mid thirties) & we were extremely sick the entire next day. We had been warned about the drinks there which was another reason we were being careful but we certainly didn't expect this to happen! Save your money & don't go here. I wouldn't recommend this experience to my worst enemy. The horrible pain in my stomach I can't even describe. I would've went to hospital if I was back home. I couldn't eat, drink or even stand up for 36hrs afterwards. It's not worth it."

Upon arriving it seem like a good time and an employee named Edith approached us to sell us the tickets. The only info she gave us was that the were only $70.00 USD tickets available. She asked for IDs and when we couldn't provide them. She still proceeded to sell us the tickets. Upon entry for the first 20 minutes of the show it seemed like it was going to be a good time until they kept packing people in. We couldn't move and the staff was rude and pushing us. So we decided to leave after 40 minutes of being there because we couldn't dance or keep having a good time. As we were exiting the building, there was a long line of people still being shoved in and we couldn't believe they were trying to fit more people. when we got outside an employee named Paula approach us to see why we were leaving and we told her because it was to crowed. She started talking to us about what she could do for us and her only option was to come back the next day on a Saturday (which it will probably still be packed) but we were also leaving and when we told her this she gave us no other option replying that the only reason she stopped us was to tell us not to write a bad review and they could not give refund only admissions for a different day. Different employees approach us giving us different excuses and telling us they had general admission $20.00 tickets available that we should had purchased those. we started getting frustrated with the change of people and stories, so we asked Paula for her to be the only one to talk to us as she was the original person that approached us. Before we asked for her, another group of people were complaining for the same reason and they purchased 8 tickets for $1000.00. and were unable to get the money back because they signed a waiver stating no refunds. We realize that we did not sign anything and approach Paula with this info. She asked employee sold us the tickets and employee was Edith whom approached us at that point and yelling that she told us that it will get packed and that they don't do refunds. at that point she offer to give us tickets for us to sell to other people, but we couldn't do that as we were leaving and no one will buy from someone on the street (I wouldn't ) she kept shaking her head saying that she understands but was not helpful at all. After 2 hours, we finally were able to get our money back, except for our lost time in our trip. The show seemed worth watching, but the staff, the overcrowded place gave it a bad experience to be in. The just want to sell as many tickets as they can to make the max amount of money."

Admittedly as a 51 year old man I am probably not this venue's target audience, but I do have lots of experience of both working on and seeing theatrical shows and have also been to quite a few clubs over the years. I decided to buy a gold member pass having read pretty amazing reviews about this venue on trip advisor. Unfortunately I can only describe it as a rather soulless money making enterprise. The alcohol (included in the price) keeps coming but so do the girls trying to persuade/hassle you into buying drinks that aren't included... And will suggest you are boring if you don't decide to partake. The VIP seating area is basically high stools on the narrow platform you see the show from. To start there is an hour of short clips from music videos interspersed with live camera shots of the crowd. I personally didn't think a lot of the women appreciated having the cameras constantly zoom in on their breasts but maybe I'm wrong. The aerial work in the show is great and hats off to the performers working in such a small space and busy atmosphere. However the bulk of the show consists of dancers miming to extracts from films and music videos. Strangely, the actual films are projected behind the dancers - making me want to see the real performers sing, not someone impersonate them (with varying degrees of success). I was really hoping to have a good dance once the show was over, but each track is played for such a short time (usually less than a minute) there seemed to be no attempt to build an atmosphere or to allow people to get into and enjoy the music. I doubt my review will put many people off going to this well oiled money making machine, but there are definitely better ways of spending your money in Playa. Or save it and see a good show on Broadway or the West End. My two stars are for the aerial work (which, I repeat, was good) but honestly, think twice about going."

If you want a good night out with a relaxed carnival atmosphere then I would recommend going here"

After much haggling with the sales reps (at our resort) we negotiated a hugely discounted price for 7 of us for table service in a dedicated area. Our ticket price included a bottle of spirits (either tequila, white rum, vodka or similar) between 2/3 of us with all mixers/ice. We bought bottled beer as needed (very cheap) but otherwise were very happy on our private (albeit tiny) balcony with our very own waiter (we sent him away pretty sharpish with a big tip and most of the balcony furniture). As we ploughed through our tequila and vodka (two bottles - followed by a very costly third) and ton of mixers we enjoyed a fantastic stage show and even better music. We were ferried to and from the venue from our hotel which made the experience extremely painless (handy since we were definitely feeling the pain on the way out). The table package is worth the extra for a prime spot for the entertainment (and even the main stage for drunk mum dancing later in the night) and to avoid the jostle at the bars. Top tip, make sure to take your passports or other ID with you to avoid hassle getting in - it will ensure you get fastracked right through to the action. Others we spoke to suggested it is even cheaper to go if you book online before you leave for vacation but can't vouch for that. As it is, we paid c. $75 a head for an all inclusive experience (reduced from an alleged $150/head rate).I can't recommend it highly enough for a wildly entertaining night out. Seriously one of the best evenings we've had in a long while."

I was not sure I wanted to tag along with the group of friends that were going but I'm glad I did. It's not my thing, but it was definitely pretty cool to have done it! Tip: don't drink the alcohol there--it's plentiful (they start pouring shots down your throat at the entrance!) and it's super cheap quality--2 people in our group got throw-up sick from drinking."

            "review": "Ten of us got ripped off.... NEVER GO HERE.. Visited the Mayan Riviera with the family and some friends. We had been to Coco Bongo in Punta Cana and had a great time there, so we thought let's do it again.Saw Oscar and Pedro (Coco Bongo reps) at the Grand Palladium and inquired about the various packages offered in Playa del Carmen. We opted for the private table with a bottle. This was supposed to give us, no waiting on line, met by a host, and as per their website, \"Feel the energy of the party with a privileged view of the show, just two steps from the crowd, enjoying the advantages that this unique location has reservation for you\" We were met by Pedro at our lobby 15 minutes late, the bus then picked up several others in different hotels and we were dropped off 3 blocks away from Coco Bongo.Also told we would have to walk back at the end of the night to same location.Pedro the coco bongo rep took us to the bar and those who had purchased floor tickets were told where to line up. The ten of us who had purchased a private table with a bottle were taken in by Pedro and he turned us over to some guy who then told one of his servers to take us to our tables.So far... we were OK with the walking even though our dates were all wearing high hills and were all dressed up. We were also Ok with the bus been late 15 minutes, we were also Ok with the fact the bus did not have any music. However, things got complicated. We were escorted to the third floor which is the highest you can go. There we were told that we would have privacy as there will be no one else and we could lean on the hand rail and see the show on the ground floor and directly across from us. After we were promised by the Coco Bongo rep that we were going to be alone we decided not to pursue this any further.We arrived at the bar and on the screen the time said; 47 minutes left before the show would start, and there 3 empty VIP tables on the left side, and 3 empty tables on the right side. Once the show began, we all stood up and leaned against the hand rail where we could see the entire show. The only draw back was we were not part of the high energy crowd below us. Twenty minutes later, 30-35 younger kids were brought up to our section. The Coco Bongo waiters told us very abruptly we had to go back to our designated seating area. We all told them we could not see any thing from there as we were right against the wall and now all these people which were part of the 3 bar excursion were right in front of us blocking our view. One of them said it wasn't his problem.Our waiter, came late and brought us the five bottles we had purchased, One per couple, and placed them in the corner along with the mix. We waited another 20 minutes before he even brought us the glasses and ice. After our waiter served our first drink, he was too busy with the group in front of us and never again did we see him until the very end when it was time to collect his tip. This brings another complaint we have. When we purchased exactly the same package in Punta Cana, they did not added any other money to the bill. However, in Playa del Carmen, we were charged an additional 15% of the cost of the bottle which was $125US dollars for gratuity. No wonder why the service was so terrible.... the waiters already know they have their tip secured so why work.We were not having a good time, so we asked a Coco Bongo waiter if this was a private table zone. He said, no the private tables were below, and also told us that this area was more for the tours or if they had more than the capacity they opened the third floor. I asked several Coco Bongo servers if they could have a supervisor or any one in charge come up and see us.We then noticed an older man in the same uniform standing near us, and never approached us. We then called him over.... by now the show has just passed the hour. He introduced him self as Adrian Moreno. We asked him what was his job and he said he was in charge of the area where we were, that he was basically responsible to see everyone having fun as he was the captain of the area.We told Adrian that we (5 couples) had purchased packages for private tables and we were extremely upset how we had been treated and where we had been sat. Adrian was not help, he came up with every excuse on the book. First he said that when we arrived there were no tables. WRONG... there were 6 tables available with then sign that said RESERVED. Adrian then said this was the best place in the whole bar... WRONG this section is only opened when the main floor is over sold and/or for bar tours. Adrian then told us that Pedro or Oscar (Coco Bongo reps at the Palladium) had requested we were taken to this location. WRONG... I was beside Pedro at all times and he never said such thing, and we asked him the following day which he also denied of saying or requesting such. In fact, Pedro was not happy how we had been treated the night before.Adrian said that he could not do any thing....so I told him that it was OK, we would all write a review on TripAdvisor, and tweeter.Adrian left us and returned 30 minutes later. He told me he had a table for 4 of us, and showed me where it was. The table would have been directly under the stage where the show takes place. I said no we would be under the stage and every one else would be left behind. I asked him if there was a Manager as it was obvious he was not going to be able to take care of us, and he never answered it. The show had been running now for over 2 hours and a man came up to us and introduced himself as Manuel Hernandez and said he was the assistant manager. He said he knew what had taken place as Adrian Moreno had briefed him. Manuel apologized several times and said he was going to take care of us immediately. Half an hour later Manuel said he was preparing two VIP tables for us. We asked him and where are you putting the people that are seating in those tables?.... also 10 of us would not be able to fit in such confined space, and there was only half an hour left of the show left.We told Manuel that Coco Bongo had failed to provide the service, and comply with a contract with ten of us. He insisted that we could see the show from where we were... when asked if he had to pay what we were paying for a private table and suddenly the only thing you were able to see were the back of the heads of all the people placed in front of us... would you be OK with that?... Manuel said No, and apologized but, no solutions.I have to say that he offered me a t-shirt from Coco Bongo. I was more insulted by that rather than making me feel any better. I denied his bribe. We would all have left a lot sooner, but unfortunately we had to wait for the bus to pick us up. Probably the worse time we have ever had on a night out after we paid a good amount of money for a service that was not delivered, and management refused to fix the problem from the start.I have another review of Coco Bongo in Punta Cana and I highly recommend it. But I would strongly advise you that if you care how you are treated while on vacation, and want a good service, Playa del Carmen Coco Bongo is not for you.I also have to bring this to your attention, this location is smaller, and the show is exactly the same as any other Coco Bongo. It is certainly not worth going twice, the show is boring and the sound system here inferior.We also informed the concierge at Palladium of our experience at Coco Bongo. They should not allow their reps to be at 5 star resort if Coco Bongo is not going to treat their guests well."

We got plenty of drinks regularly and had our own waiter! Enjoyed the acts and music that was played. My daughter and I were asked to dance on the main stage which was a good experience! All staff were very friendly and I got talking to Saidy who provides the toilet service there. This was where I put my Spanish skills to use! She was lovely. Make sure you tip the toilet staff and waiters who work really hard to make sure you have a good night! There was one negative though. The tables were too close together so you were touching the people next to you on other tables. A great night, but would have been even better if there was more room inbetween the VIP tables."

Taken straight to the front of the line, escorted to our own tables on a balcony over looking the stage. We had our own waiter with unlimited drinks all night. Give the waiter a couple of small tips early on in the night and you won't ever have an empty glass. You do have to be prepared for a very very busy club though, I would not have wanted to be on the main floor of the club which looked incredibly packed. That being said there's loads of staff throughout the club and it feels very well organised and safe. All in all, if your visiting Mexico this is not to be missed!"

It's difficult for me, because for 4 years I have raved to everyone how magical this show is, sadly this time I feel a little different.Don't get me wrong, this is still the most incredible show in the World in my opinion, but there were just a few things that I felt let it down a bit.Back in 2012, I was simply blown away but the incredible fast action, unbelievable stunts and the atmosphere of the club. A place like no other, an experience like never before. Perhaps this is why I feel a bit let down.To me the show didn't flow as I felt it should. It wasn't as quick paced, there were gaps and much of the stuff was totally identical to the last time. I know they have routines for the night, but it was Tron, Spiderman and the Passion of Christ as the main shows as it was in 2012. I had hoped to see the Matrix, Batman v Bane, Captain America or some new shows. The new show was Star Wars and for me it went on a bit too long.The show started at 11.30 instead of 11.00 and finished at 3.00 with a DJ set by the resident DJ. I'm pretty sure the show used to be 4 hours long and in all honesty it felt a bit like it was being rushed through.The atmosphere just wasn't quite the same. I don't know if this was down to the inclusion of so many tables, or the \"Juan hell of a night\" crowd who only get to see the first two hours of the show and then ushered back out again.It's very crowded on the balconies and was quite a relief when the two beside me decided to go as it gave me decent room.For all these gripes, there is absolutely no doubt that there is no place on earth like the Coco Bongo and you will not see a better show anywhere. I just feel they have reached a stage where they know they have made it and feel as though they don't need to keep pushing and they can relax a bit. What made the Coco Bongo was how utterly jaw-dropping it was and the atmosphere.It's with a heavy heart I give it 4/5, but would I go back. Silly question - of course I would, in a heartbeat."

We had great seats up next to the stage and at the same level so you didn't miss anything, we had our own waiter all night who brought us drinks constantly without asking. The shows were brilliant especially the acrobatics and the effect the dancers put in is amazing. It is a must do thing in Mexico, If I go back I'll defiantly be going again. Top tip woman go round selling shots but if you ask your waiter and you are a gold member they are included in the price so don't buy any! Also you can have photos taken with The Mask and Beatlejuice but make sure you take some money to buy these as you can not take them on your mobile."

            "review": "Good night out. I went to Coco Bongos with my husband on our honeymoon as we had been told it was an amazing night and there was a lot of hype about it. We booked through our travel agent so got VIP/Gold Member access and transfers to and from the hotel. I'd advise on doing this as there's less craning your neck to see the stage and you get seats rather than standing - the show lasted from about 11pm until 3am so it's worth having the seats. You also get waiter service with VIP access, our waiter was lovely and we didn't have to ask for drinks at any point he just kept bringing new ones when we were almost done. We tipped when we arrived and as we left so have some money for this.The show itself was good, the acrobatics were great, the miming was a bit cheesy at times as the people didn't know the words they were miming along to but all in all it was good fun and we both enjoyed it. The brief moments I spent on the dance floor were fun but a little claustrophobic so I preferred to dance in the VIP bit.The one thing we did find a bit cringy was the constant zooming in on boobs/bums on the big screen in between acts in the show. It was funny for maybe the first hour but after that it was a bit OTT.Our transfer home got us at 3.30am but if you haven't got transfers booked it's very easy to get a taxi as they are all waiting outside. We felt safe outside the club. We were told at the hotel standard taxi from Playa del carmen to our hotel in riviera maya was about 300 pesos but the guy there said 400/500 and not to pay more than 500 - so have extra money with you in case.Overall, I wouldn't say it was *quite* as amazing as all the hype but it was certainly a good and funny night out, worth doing."

If you are looking for a good time in PDC I can't imagine there is anyway you won't have great fun at Coco Bongo. Having not been to a \"nightclub\" for many years we weren't sure about it when our builder in the UK mentioned Coco Bongo but then we met Anna at our hotel (Secrets Maroma) who was selling tickets. She explained to us that CB is more show than a noisy nightclub and convinced us that it would be the best night of our holiday and we should go for the gold package with seats and a table upstairs. Not a cheap choice with 7 of us (ages from 21 to 55) but just the best decision on all counts........ Anna met us for the private hotel transfer (30 mins from Maroma) and escorted us to the queue and then upstairs where she helped us get just a fantastic table facing the stage. If you staying in PDC and buy tickets directly if you can go for the gold package, get there early (10pm for the 1130pm show start) & get yourself a good seat and then JOIN IN!!!!!If in any doubt - JUST GO!!! We all had the best best time - plan a quiet day the next morning as the show doesn't finish until 3am but it's so so worth it. 21 & 25 year old student nieces and nephew think it was the best night out they've ever had and us \"grown up's\" aren't that far behind. Thanks for convincing us Anna. Brilliant brilliant night. Final suggestion, tip the barman / waiter when you arrive and then again half way through and the drinks will just keep coming. Have I said what a fabulous night it was?? "

Gold package was about \u00a3135 per person, that included transport there n back, fast pass into club, seats with table free drink n ur own waiter !!! We decided to think about it before buying tickets as there was 4 of us !!!! Then we were offered a in between package think they called it platinum?, \u00a383 per person, this included transport, a faster entry into club, seating n a bottle of grey goose vodka(our choice of bottle) so we booked to go !! Picked up from hotel at 9.45 n home at 3.30am !!! Queued for a little but not too long, thank god as there was lots of people waiting to get in, we were taken in, handed random shots n showed to our seats, there was 3 levels . . . . First impression was where the hell is everyone gonna go Our seats were steps, with a tiny cushion that wud fit one person, I sat on the step, my pal on the seat n our hubbys stood behind , the place filled up quickly, our waiter was fab for about the first hour then he didn't seem to bother, our hubbys complained to one of the bouncer type guys regarding wot they first Thot was a drink poured over them only to turn round to see a female havin a pee into her glass but obviously missing, disgusting , she obviously didn't want to lose her space while standing if she went to the toilets, the girls manning the toilets were fab , the bouncer said he would go n have a word but that obv didn't happen !!!!

Well they aren't half a good as this place actually is!!!Me and my girlfriend recently visited Mexico and has already heard about coco bongo and wanted to visit it. Also in the hotel before the evening entertainment there was a short promo video. All of these things led us to believe it was going to be good and we were still amazed. We paid around \u00a370 each with our holiday rep which gave us VIP. For this we got a shorter que, our own table on the balcony with our own waiter and unlimited free drinks after 10:30. Door open to VIP at 10, we started queuing at 9:35 and were very close to the front so we were among the first in with the best seats. The main show didn't start until 11:40ish but that 1:40 flew by. The show. Wow! Too many different shows to mention but our favourites included the Michele Jackson, tron, cirque du soleil type with multiple acrobatics, Gun n roses, Star Wars with Jedis & Darth Vader flying though the air. Each show is around 15 minutes long so the variety is amazing. Between each show is around a 15 minutes where the music is turned up and air cannons, ticker tap cannons come alive, at one point thousands of balloons were dropping from the sealing, it's just mental!As a VIP you are still able to go down on to the floor but having your own table was much better as you are there for a long time and having our own waiter was brilliant! He kept us supplied with branded drinks with reasonable measures. Once I tipped him a 100 peso if our drinks were less than a third full we'd have fresh drinks, another 100 peso and he'd bring the branded bottle to me and fill the glass as I wanted, then top up with coke so the extra few pounds goes a long way. Also when we left we felt like our waiter was genuinely grateful and appreciated the little money we gave him, but at no time did we feel obliged or obligated to. Me and my girlfriend aren't the clubby type but we loved Coco Bongo and have recommended this place to everybody! "

But the theatrical performances are very kitsch and the comedic numbers involving a Beetlejuice and The Mask parody don't work. The drinks are free and watered down (I was not drunk despite continuous refills of 'tequila' sunrise). Also beware: the drink you first order is the drink you'll be served all night. We paid extra for the Gold Member service: not sure if this was good value for money. Maybe next time we would buy a bottle on the dance floor which gets you a side table instead. Also the show is far too long at close to 5 hours. But really the biggest turn off (speaking as a man here) is the gratuitous shots on a big screen up women's skirts, down their tops, and round their behinds. The women didn't seem to mind, and I got the joke but it wore thin after the first 20 times."

Four of us ladies went on a tuesday night, it cost us 10$ paid at our hotel for transportation and then 60$ at coco bongos for admission. this incudes open bar..you can pay dollars, peso's, or credit card. we arrived at about 945pm long lines but we got in just fine. They did proof so beware if underage.they have all different packages you can get, tables and seating, dont know how much that costs..but the place is not large and there is a stage right in the middle of the floor, there are tons of employees around . Had no idea what to expect but OMG it was fantastic. It was not like any club i've been too. you dance alittle and watch the show, which is wonderful and exciting.we were luck enough to get pulled to go up onto the semi second level. some gentlemen that had table reserved welcomed us to their area. if we didnt have that space to stand and dance.... i dont know how happy i would be ... the lower floor level is packed. i don't know how those people got any drinks all night??? wear comfortable shoes. you will be standing all night lots of the ladies wore flat sandles.It's defiantly a must do LOVED IT!!!!"

An actual bus picked us up at 9:30pm since it was sooo many people going. Arrived at the bus station in town, yes the bus station and walked a few blocks to the club. OMG, the line was ridiculously long. Mind you, if you don't have a vip, upgrade, or anything, be prepared to wait in line for more than an hour. I waited 90 minutes. Upon getting in, you're greeted with a drink. Probably the only drink you will get all night. Mexico apparently doesn't believe in capacity limits because that place was so jam packed. If you don't mind elbowing people or getting elbowed then its ok. We tried to walk through the bar down the main platform but oh no, there was no room. Guards try to light the way but there is literally no way to get through without pushing people. There are tables, sit down areas, but if you didn't pay $300 plus for vip or bottle service, you don't get to sit. Not only that, after so often they blow confetti every once in a while, and the smallest men come and try to sweep it up. It was the worst place ever. The show however is good. That is the one and only thing I enjoyed. Everyone can see it since it is a big screen and a higher dance floor. If i could take it back, I would save my money. This was not at all for me or my husband."

            "review": "Second Visit - Not Again. Went with a wedding group of around 20 on a Thursday night. Compared to my last visit, this one was totally disappointing. As we had pre-booked a group, we were told an area would be reserved for our group. What we weren't gold was that this was in the nose bled area way at the top, in the back row at the very end. This made it totally impossible to see anything of the show, even when you stood on he seat. The video screens were only partially visible, so not much help there.Luckily we were right next to the bathroom so at least we didn't have to push through the crowd to get one. Bad news is that this also meant we were one of the last to get anything to drink. Think I was able to snag around 4-5 beers tops for an \"open bar\" ticket, which made the ratio of cost to drinks very high.Other reviewers comments on the shot girls are spot on: pushy, annoying, and irritated when you ask why you need to pay $5 for something that should be included in an open bar ticket.What I could see of the show was great, although it was 90% the same as the first visit six years ago. The opening, Phantom of the Opera, is fantastic: music pumped, great dancers, and seeing them fly through the air on cloth ropes is a highlight. Being where we were, one highlight was getting to see the stage set up for the numbers, definitely not something everyone gets to see and quite fascinating.Pros:- All inclusive drinks, if you're near the bar- The show is well worth the price of admission, if you come early to get a good spot- Security doesn't tolerate trouble, they are there to ensure your safetyCons:- The place is oversold, always; you can't even walk at times. Can be claustrophobic at times with a lot of people pressing into you to get a better view- Wait staff are great, but the customer to staff ratio is really high meaning you'll wait for drinks- Shot girls are really annoying, paying for something that should be part of your ticketSo, should you visit? Yes, at least once. If you get there early to get close to one of the bars where you have a great view of the stage you will really enjoy it. Otherwise, the experience may be different. Are the gold tickets worth it? Can't say for sure as both times was on a regular ticket."

We booked gold member tickets through Thomson and although transport was included we were advised to get a taxi in and queue early to get better seats which we did and we had very good seats with a table so we're not disappointed. They were quite expensive at $130 per person but you get free drinks all night and transport there and back so worth the money.Once sat down the show starts after about an hour and a half so it's more of a club for the first part. Once show starts there are some really quite good acts with silk ropes and lots of acrobatics but there are a few 'gap fillers' which are just people dressed up as pop stars dancing to a music video which got a bit samey but like I said they were really just gap fillers and time to let the main act people change into their different outfits.Drinks were flowing all night from the waiter, we had a guy named William who was very good at bringing us drinks before ours were empty so we never had to ask. There are girls who come round offering shots but we didn't have any due to them being $5 a shot. The shot girls are quite insistent and do keep asking again and again but we politely said no each time.Toilets in this place were very clean, on my first visit the toilet assistant wiped the seat and everything but I refused to let her do it again as I don't believe people should be made to do that for others and I was a bit uncomfortable with it. She was very lovely and made sure you were happy and having a good time.Only downside to the evening really is that the Camera man has an obsession of sexually objectifying females so if you are not ok with having your breasts and bum zoomed in on for everyone else's entertainment you will probably be pretty unhappy for the most part. Men ending up grabbing their partners and sticking their fingers up at the camera man in the end. I felt this just went a little too far, funny for the first few times but after 4 hours of constantly picking on the same people it was too much. There were some who played up to the camera and maybe they should just stick to zooming in on them?? We left early in the end as my chest had been on show more times than I care to remember and I had been asked to go dance on stage one too many times. I had been polite throughout in saying no but they just kept asking again and again and I felt a bit uncomfortable. However if you like being the centre of attention then go wearing something revealing and you'll be dancing on stage before you know it with a camera displaying everything. I can imagine if you are out with the girls to have fun then this would be perfect but if you're going as a couple and you just want to have a good night the attention can be too much. Based on the show, the night out and the service I would give this place a 5 and I would recommend going as it is a good experience but we would not return ourselves."

So paid more for offered upgrade, again did not get what was promised. Was promised open bar, there wasn't. Was promised seats and table, there was not. Overal review-Great fire hazard as multi-levels with only one way to exit. Smoking on small balcony that is not an exit, but it one story up and very narrow. The cold air/oxygen that was blown in felt good considering so many bodies packed in but so much confetti clogged the already packed floors. The stages probably had good show but with so many people pushing there was no clear was to see it. I want to stress again if there were a fire people would die. Too many bodies with too little space and exits."

We tried coco bongos in playa del carmen, booked with the coco bongos ticket sales guy round the pool. Told us the weekend is better. What he didn't tell us is unless you book a table you won't be able to move. We got injured, pushed around by staff, was not allowed to stand anywhere. We had to leave after 50 mins of being in there. They had double the capacity so if there was a fire you would get crushed. The place is tiny. We spent 4 hours in a pharmacy. They helped my aunts swelling go down on her feet. Coco bongos promised us they would deal with this. All we wanted was a refund as the night ended up costing us more in taxis. We was at ocean maya royale and had a week left and still we have had no result. It's now been 3 weeks since we went out, back in England and broken promises that coco bongo would still deal with us when we left. We have been ignored. All they care about is your money, it's a health hazard and I will be taking this further as I visit Mexico nearly every year."

We booked the bar crawl with Thomson where there were approximately 30-40 of us and we went to 3 of the bars before heading to Coco Bongo. All our drinks were included and we paid approx $80 per person.This included the Goldmember package where you view the shows at Coco Bongo from the balcony. It is standing, no seats but you have staff coming around asking for your drinks. And it wasn't over crowded on the balcony.The show is incredible and so atmospheric. They have tribute acts such as Queen, Elvis, Madonna and Cirque du Soleil style performances. We only spent 2-3 hours here as part of the bar crawl, however the show does last much longer than this. I think 2-3 hours was more than enough time opposed to watching the full show which you can also book and it is more expensive. But either way I do recommended the goldmember to watch from the balcony as it did look very crowded and hectic on the ground floor. And also we had a fantastic view."

We arrived early so we could get prime seating in the VIP area but they could not find our booking so asked us to wait. By the time they told us they had no booking but can fit us in everyone had passed on got the best seats. We ended up in a corner where all the dancers did costume changes so unable to have a boogie without getting in their way. Drinks were constant but boy was we cold.....everyone else was sweating but our position restricted us. The show.......well it was ok....I have certainly seen better dancers and personally I would have preferred to listen to something other than Rap or Modern Pop....maybe a bit of Club Classic Music as it is a Club after all. The show is good and I would highly recommend it for the experience as they do put on a great routine and the Silks are very good along with the Trapeze Dancers. I just wish our booking would not have been messed up and I would have scored a 5 despite the show being pretty average. Worth \u00a3110....not when you have paid \u00a330 to get in some of the best clubs in the world....but Mexico is extortionate for Excursions and Trips."

The night was very good, at the beginning our waiter came over and introduced himself and kept our drinks coming all night without having to ask. There were people of all ages (18+) there. But being late twenties and not a clubber any more I did feel there were plenty of cringey moments like girls pulling down there tops and getting their bums out when on camera. But I guess that can't be helped when alcohol is flowing. The show it self is very impressive. But if your not drinking and dancing I would say it might be a bit disappointing and there was a lot of filler of general clubbing with not much else going on in regards to a \"show\". I paid to be in the VIP area.. I wasn't hot and it wasn't overcrowded. But I wanted to dance and found it very hard to, looking down at the dance floor I think the guys down there seemed to have a better time. So depending on whether your a people watcher, want a bit of space or a dancer I reckon VIP is not necessarily the better option. We stayed to about 345 when the DJ came on. It by no means dragged and I did really enjoy myself."

The place is quite small but is built upwards so goes up different levels, and is very busy so for those who don't like confined spaces it may not be for you. The party I was with decided to head towards the main stage where you are surrounded by different acts, beetle juice and the mask running about taking pictures and girls offering tequila shots for $10. We were in for 3 hours, which I felt was enough time to enjoy it and gain an amazing experience, would definitely go back if I ever visit Mexico again."

The camera would pick the prettier girls and zoom in their breasts, hips and legs. They only invite girls to go up on \"stage\" to dance, and they insist a lot with the pretty girls to go there. Some times it was written \"booty cam\" in the screen and they should zoom in the girls on stage behinds from the bottom and at the same time a strong air blow would try to move the girl skirt up. I wasn't expecting that. The impression we got is the general nightclub logic that the clients are the men and the women are the product of the party. In the entrance, on the line on the street, the woman dancers were making sexy moves trying to attract costumers. Before the show starts these dancers entertain the guests with very sexy dances. There are men dancers too, but they're much fewer, they get on the \"stage\" later, and they far more discrete. There were girls selling a special paid drink for 5 dollars, which doesn't make a lot of sense in an open bar party. Every 5 minutes you would see one of them, so I felt like having to thank and deny all the sellers in 5th avenue. One of this girl touched my girlfriend breast trying to attract our attention, which we found very weird."

I booked this place for a night out to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday(I am not a lover of disco/show bars).But what a wonderful surprise, the staff where great and although the place was very busy they made a special thing for my wife. A lot of the staff stood around ,let of party poppers ,streamers and sung happy birthday.The bar service was the best I have had in a long time, the second your drink was nearly empty it was replaced with good quality drink.We had the best time and it will be a memory my wife will not forget for a long time."

This was my fourth visit to coco bongo....(other three times were in playa del Carmen) all were an amazing night out as usual!I Was not impressed with the sales tactics of the rep who sold us these cancun coco tickets....he downright lied about its location being walking distance. (Sunset marina to coco bongo Is not a 5 min walk as he promised). That Rep sold us this while we were vacationing at haciendas tres Rios. Took our oldest son this time and had a Blast. My only complaint is there were no shows to take out others underage children too....they were dissapointed and would have been a perfect family show if it wasn't cancelled due to busy season. (Xmas holiday time) Hopefully will have a show we can take them to our next visit.Last time at coco in playa we had the most amazing rep Alex. He helped us plan the most amazing bachelor parties for friends and was a fine rep of coco bongo, he was the man and made it all happen. We had the BEST treatment and time there with all credit to him."

The show itself is mesmerizing with the acrobats and dancing there`s even some comedy in there as well amazing experience all round."

We paid \u00a3112.00 pp for VIP which included a bottle of vodka, waiter service and unlimited drinks.When we arrived the four of us were taken to our seat which was a step up from the main floor. We had a tiny table and us two females we sat on a bench and the men we to sit directly behind us higher up on the ledge with their feet at either side of us. I'm not exaggerating when I say we had 1 x square meter of space for us all to share. Each table beside us was the same. No room to dance or move for that matter. When we finished the vodka, trying to get a drink was almost impossible. It appeared that other non Europeans at eitherside of us received better service and were always given drinks. We managed to get two throughout the night. We gave our waiter a tip at the beginning of the night too! Going to the bar was not an option due to the floor being packed with people shoulder to shoulder.I went to use the toilets at the other side of the main floor approx 25 metres. It took 25 minutes to get there and back. Not because the toilets were busy, we got straight in. It was because there were so many people on the main floor there was no room to move. I am not exaggerating when i say we were crammed in like sardines!!! Anything his place has to offer is completely ruined by how many people are inside. It appeared to be about how much money they can make rather than offering a good service. The show was people miming, no actual live singing.God forbid there was an emergency and the place needed to be evacuated. People would be trampled. I'd read the bad reviews and thought people were moaning about nothing, i can confirm they were not. We left at 01.00hrs and missed a lot of the show because we couldn't stand being in such a small space anymore. People will want to try it, of course because there is such a huge hype. My only suggetion would be to go Gold Member. That way you're on a balcony away from the carnage!!"

I have never danced, sang or drank so much tequila. I can not explain how much fun this night was, the shows themselves would rival any west end performance and then the breaks for dancing were a welcome release for all that built up energy. I highly recommend if you book standard tickets as I did as VIP was full, to upgrade and buy a bottle when you arrive as this not only gives you a premium bottle of spirit & mixers but you get a table and seating which you will definitely need I paid about \u00a3123.00 for this which is a bargain compared to the uk.

I did 20 pesos at the beginning and then after every 3 rounds. Totalled about 120 pesos ( under \u00a35) and the glasses where never empty.Where we where sat there was only 1 female toilet ( with 1 stall from what my finac\u00e9 says) and only 2 people where allowed in the mens at one time.

You will probably have a couple of cocktail marks on you tops. but if you like having super cocktails and branded drinks JD etc. and having the best most entertaining night you ever had then your in the right place. when you walk in there is a clock ticking down when that clock hit 0 its ShowTime and what a show. I wont spoil it other than if you like to see batman chasing Bain across the room on zip wires and throw Spiderman and beetle juice in to the mix with a hint of Chicago ,Elvis, Bruno mars and Madonna and don't forget Gaga as well as a load of music from 70s.80s,90s then your in the right place. taxis right outside straight back to hotel no problems . been falling down drunk both times I have been and seen no problems what so ever. one more tip even with golden tickets get there early to get the best seat although all gold tickets seats are good and when your sweltering in the cue there is a 7-11 across the road go and get dos cerveza por favour and get ready for an mazing night .enjoy."

It was around \u00a390 each that included drinks all night and you were sat in the best seats in the place. Although down on the dance floor looked fun too and I'm sure it was much cheaper! Would definitely go again!"

Went with a group of 8 people from 18 to 49 in age. The younger ones were just barely ok with the experience and all of the over 40 hated it. We were herded on to an upper balcony like cattle and packed in let me tell you....packed in like sardines. Even our 6 foot plus twenty something young man said he could barely see any of the show. Us that were just over 5 feet caught maybe 10 minutes out of the 3 hours we were there. We received one drink and one shot when we came in the door. If you wanted anything else of the supposed unlimited alcohol u had to just swipe it off a waiters tray when he was coming through. We arrived at 9:30 and did not actually get into the building until around 10:30. We were all ready to leave when 12:30 arrived but we toughed it out for a little longer. Our paid transportation was not due to arrive until 3:30 so we all ended up paying for a cab on the way home. Another 80.00 spent between us. This is a total waste of time and money and God forbid a fire might break out it the place...all would parish for sure!!!! Terrible, Awful experience. Do Not I repeat DO NOT waste your hard earned money!!!!!!!"

The transport there and back was provided and you get all inclusive drinks all night - we were in the Gold member part so we had a waiter that served our table with 4 other people who came from the same hotel. We were never waiting for a drink - he was on it! We were on a table at the side of the stage so we had brilliant views of the show but when the performers were on the stage in the middle of the dancefloor we couldn't see. The performers were brilliant - so so talented and there was a mixture of everything! Flying artists, martial arts, dancing of all varieties - I don't want to spoil it by revealing too much but it was BRILLIANT! The atmosphere was insane!I wouldn't recommend a standard ticket as the downstairs was rammed. I have never been in a club with so many people it took us 15 mins to squeeze through the crowds to our seats and the club is SMALL - much smaller than I anticipated - they squeeze every last person in.We paid over \u00a3100 for tickets - which I never would normally for a club - I wouldn't even spend that on a West End show so I do think it was overpriced. We aren't massive drinkers so for us it was expensive but if you drink crazily excessively you would eventually get your moneys worth. It's full every night though we struggled to get tickets so they are doing something right! I would recommend this experience it was a brilliant night - but treat it as a holiday one off.Show starts around 11pm and finishes 3.30am"

We did not queue for long when we arrived, 15-20 mins max - I expected longer considering the size of the club. As part of the Thompson's bar crawl package deal we had access to the VIP area above the main area & directly opposite the stage. We were taken great care of by staff, a waiter called Juan came over & introduced himself to us straight away & we didn't go 5 minutes without a drink in our hands. We were in Coco Bongo from around 11pm-1:30 (a downfall to the Thompson's package was that we had to leave by 1:30) the shows during this time seemed to be every 15 minutes or so & were outstanding. The biggest downfall to our Coco Bongo experience was the toilets, I'm unsure of the capacity of the VIP area but there seemed to be 100+ people - there were only 2 toilet cubicles that we could access in the VIP area for both male & females. This caused a major issue as the queue for the toilets was huge & at one point I was waiting for around 20 minutes meaning I missed a big chunk of the entertainment. Aside from this we had a fantastic night & would definitely come back - we would maybe just drink less before we arrived so that we wouldn't have to wait in toilet queues!!!"

The show was incredible do as the music. It was packed completely but the people were really cool. Lots of security inside the club keeps things smooth. We bought an bottle pass but were also bought open bar. For our surprise we didn't even had to go to it we had a guy assigned to our section and he really took care of us all night.

Only advantage was that we jumped the queue and didn't have to wait hours to get in. Younger generation seem to think that this was a bit of a booze cruise and thoroughly enjoyed the all inclusive option. In our opinion was less of a show that a musical with 3/4 of the show being music and a meat market of young girls being perved on"

Normally I love coco bongo and the atmosphere is amazing and the shows dazzling. Tonight's was just a huge let down. We had paid for gold so that we would have the table and a good view. Instead we were taken to a table near the bar without stools and had to endure everyone bumping in to us as we were near the bathroom also. We didn't have a good view of the show and the bar area was noisy so didn't get the same atmosphere.The shows weren't as good as ones seen previously at the cancun and Dominican Republic ones. Even the music was a bit crap and most people over the age of twenty would have a hard time enjoying it. A friend who hadn't been before commented that he hadn't realised it was an 18-30 club. Anyone who has been before will know that coco bongo is usually fun for all ages and usually it is the older ones that enjoy it the most. I am not yet 30 and still found this an awful night. It was so hot in there and everyone was packed in like sardines. The place was far too overcrowded and like someone else said on another review it is a disaster waiting to happen. I know most probably won't care about this review but I recommend you go to the cancun one as it is a hundred times better."

The show was the same as it was 6 months ago but the actors did slightly less acrobatics. The show itself is good. Usually when i go to coco bongo i get bottle service and an exclusive section. This does not stop the pushy female staff from harassing you to buy shots. They are so pushy that you have to be down right rude for them to understand you do not want to buy a shot. So this last time i went to coco bongo i was getting harassed like usual to buy shots. The only difference this time was that i went with one friend and did not get bottle service, so as i told the shot girl for the 3rd time that i did not want shots and i continued to walk away. She went and told security that i pushed her... so they proceeded to kick me out and not listen to me. As soon as i was outside my bracelet was ripped off and the manager who just sold me my entrance pretended he did not remember me. I do not know their names but i remember faces and this type of service from cocobongo was completely unacceptable. Go once see the show but expect to be harassed and treated poorly if you are not in the vip area. The show is packed 7 nights a week so its no surprise that they do not care about the little custmers."

We were allowed early entry and given a great seat with a table and amazing view as well as a private waiter who was very friendly.

Wouldn't go again and wouldn't recommend it I'm afraid which is disappointing !"

You get the best views and the waiter tends to hang around this area"

We purchased 4 VIP tickets to go to Coco Bongo since the prior Saturday from Stefanie (The German girl at the lobby). She called and spoke to someone at Coco bongo and informed them or the purchased tickets, and even provided us with 2 additional tickets for special prizes at the event. We waited at the Coba Resort and the bus picked us up. 40 minutes later we arrive only to find out that are names were not even on their list. The people at Coco Bongo informed us that the tickets that was sold to us was not VIP tickets, and only regular tickets. We did not bring with us any money because everything was paid for. After some talking to Andrews or Erick from Coco Bongo and a supervisor taxi driver they agreed to take us aback to the hotel, wait for us to get some cash from our room and pay the taxi driver. The bottom line is we never go in Coco Bongo event or Night Club and they only were trying to see if someone cancelled their reservations to let us in as a regular paid tickets. Coco Bongo might seem to be lots of fun once inside however I would not recommend this place to any one due to the following reasons:1- Whoever was to add us to the VIP list did not.2 -We wasted time just being outside waiting just to be stranded.3- there representation is very poor.4- Not willing to help at all.5- They are happy taking your money however, no contingency plan at all when they screw-up."

Just as we got to where the exit would be, we realized it was free of people. So that was where we stayed for the evening. Even danced away by the end of the night. We were so glad we did not end up leaving. We enjoyed the shows. They were a lot of fun. Even if cheesy a bit! Was still very entertaining. The first time a worker asked us what we'd like to drink, we made sure to tip him well. For the rest of the evening he made sure we had drinks in hand just as we were finishing the last mouthful of the previous one. It really was a great experience. I'm not sure I would go again, only because I'm getting too old for that stuff. lol No regrets though experiencing it. Just the opposite. Felt alive and young at heart again!

The show started and our barman appeared, Angel, and by God was he. He kept our glasses full all night. The show was absolutely spectacular. Paper cannons and balloons filled the room often throughout the show, with people flying through the air, artists performing of ribbons, the Mask, Beetlejuice, the list goes on. In our group the age range was from 20-68 and we all loved it, there was something for everyone.If you do one thing in Mexico make sure it's Coco Bongo"

The show its was good but not spectacular in my opinion although others will probably say different. It had mostly female in their bikinis dancing on stage some male dancers too. Acrobats and tribute acts miming to songs. Music was also good. A couple of scenes from musicals like cabaret and chicago. The 'mask' comes round and you can get your photo taken$20 roughly \u00a314. It comes in a nice wooden frame with coco bongos logo it's a nice keepsake.

But i was happy i stayed because this was by far the best night club night ever. It was a fantastic setting and the show was amazing, i was gobsmacked !!! And we got plenty time to dance too. The service was beyond anything i expected.my friend had a reserved space for us with alcohol included and we had our own waiter to prepare the drinks for us all night!!! When those were finished i went over to the bar and was clearly overcharged for two drinks, the waiter when he saw me questioned me about it and when i told him how much i paid he took upon himself to go over with me and speak to the person that served me, who straight away apologise. He charged me 500 pesos for two little vodkas. I did not get my money back but got two massive cups worth the money i paid and still got some back,which i gave the waiter for looking after me. Shame i did not take his name as he was amazing and went above and beyond when he did not had too.So this was my only negative and my advise is to get advise on prices before.Apart from that this was an amazing night.it was my friends hen do and they made sure she had an amazing night and even made her part of the show,just outstanding!!!"

Gloria had sorted that one of the staff members look after us till we get to the table but when its such a mad rush getting in to a club I didnt have high hopes of this but thought would be fine and understood as its very busy but I couldnt have been more wrong .. one of the workers Carlos walked us through security explaining the whole time what was going on and got us straight to our table and settled with our lovely waiter Angel ! Be warned, it is like any nightclub and does get busy and over crowded but thats life ! The only really annoying thing bout being a Gold member is that the rest of the club seem to think its okay to try and get in to your area .. guys pay more if you want more !!!

But the hen party wanted to do the bar crawl at 2 other places then to end at Coco bongos. Arriving at the club and being told we have v.i.p and a booth I felt more comfortable knowing I wouldn't be in the crowd for too long. However walking through the crowd I was pushed, shoved and totally crushed getting into the \"VIP\" it was a sigh of relief getting into somewhere where it wasn't so crowded. Although this didn't last long it soon got so crowded you couldn't move and we did not get any VIP treatment including no table! After around 45 mins I couldn't cope and was finding it hard not to have an anxiety attack with the amount of people and sheer panic for my safety. I asked the Coco bongos rep if I could please leave through the exit to which he was insistant I stayed and got to the front which I argued that I was so uncomfortable and needed to go to which he got nasty said he had tried and walked away leaving me to find my own way out. I went to a security member who insisted I had to walk back through the crowd to get out to which I explained I was 6 months pregnant and needed to get out the safest way. After waiting around 20 minutes by the exit I got escorted out the fire exit after many arguments with security. I think coco bongos should rethink their capacity in the club Aswell as false advertising of VIP! And more importantly not only for pregnant women but anyone who finds it to much or overwhelming to be allowed to leave in the quickest and safest manor and not to be knocked back by security."

I was skeptical at first to go into town for this show late at night, and with it being 6 hours long, but it ended up being one of THE best parts of my trip. Bernardo approached us at the beach of our resort and gave us the rundown. He was not pushy at all, but more informative. I highly recommend getting the private table and your own bottle of alcohol. It's a 6 hour show/party, so it's very nice to have your own place to sit down. Plus, every table had a great view! For $110 per person, our own table, and a huge bottle of Gentlemen Jack, it was worth every penny! I look forward to visiting Coco Bongo every time I visit Playa Del Carmen now!!"

            "review": "Death trap waiting to happen. This review is specific to the Playa del Carmen location. Also, this review is not a criticism of the performers, who seemed to be very good. But for those not sure what they are paying for, the other reviews are correct. The shows are essentially performers and dancers lip syncing to music, dressed in the same costumes as the performers they are copying, with accompanying video in the background of the actual movie or music video they are lip syncing to. Still with me? In between you had some performers hang from the rafters a la Cirque du Soleli.You are also paying for a long line up in front of Coco Bongo to get in (about an hour for me). Seems like intentional so you consider paying an extra $10 per head to \"bypass\" the line. If you want a seat or table, then pay the VIP premium. Want bottle service, more money. On the night I went, I guess I was also paying to be packed in with fellow humans like sardines for the entire 3 or so hours when you finally get inside, as clearly the business model is to try and oversell the joint. By any US or Canadian standard, the capacity should be about half of the 1,000, 1,200, 1,500 or whatever number you are told can fit into the PDC location. But once you get inside, you will find out quickly. If there was an emergency or fire in the building, it will make international news...for the wrong reason.Went with a group of people and we stayed for about 40 minutes and got out of Dodge. The \"open bar\" wristband was a joke, I don't see how anyone could have moved around to get to the bar more than a couple of times...maybe. So can't confirm if the drinks were watered down or syrupy....at the end never made it to the bar in the first place.I see that the very positive reviews come from those who paid for VIP or more. You probably also got inside early and didn't have to wait in the line, even paying $70 USD up front. I can see you probably had a different experience because you actually got to sit in a chair, perhaps with a table, perhaps at one of the higher balcony levels where you had a decent view. But I was unfortunate to be stuck on the floor with the others who thought $70 bought more than 10 square inches to stand in a fire trap.Spend your money with a reputable tour operator on an excursion...hopefully someone that values your safety and gives you value for your hard earned money.But if you decide to go to Coco Bongo, at least be armed with some knowledge so you can ask proper questions to your seller at your resort....even if they will still say anything to make the sale."

We booked 2x gold member tickets and after reading some reviews we were slightly worried it wouldn't be for us - how wrong we were! The atmosphere is electric and, yes, the shows are cheesy but that's what you expect! I'd definitely recommend VIP unless you want to be standing all night and it does get quite cramped on the dance floor. In VIP you get a stool (not everyone gets a table), and served at your seat. We tipped $5 when we arrived and got constant drinks all night. When we arrived we didn't like the seats they gave us so we asked to move which they were fine with. There was only 1 toilet in the area we were sat in, and it was cleaned after each person came out which was quite time consuming but a good service. This is such a good night, and don't worry being too tired from jet lag, Coco Bongo will definitely keep you awake!"

The shows are very entertaining, however, way too many people and as the night gets going, drunken people start pushing, stepping and at times elbowing you. I must say it wasn't as enjoyable as I imagined and paying the extra $50 for VIP was a complete waste. In my opinion, it's a 1 time deal just to say you done it. No dress code but I recommend shoes so as to not hurt when getting stepped on."

I booked our VIP package with them 3 or 4 weeks ago online. The lady had very broken english. When I went to go to the club last night (my last night of our trip) they refused me entry because they had booked me for the day prior. They refused to refund my ticket or change it for the day I had asked for... a Wednesday. Not only that ,but the person assiting me spoke basically no English so it was next to impossible to get anything done about it anyways. Yes I get we were in Mexico, but this is a top tourist spot.

My boyfriend and I went once and now make it a priority to go every time we are in Mexico. At our resort now jade you can purchase coco bongo packages which pays for shuttle and entrance fee! If youre spending the $100 per person to go u may as well ask the cocoB rep when u arrive where you can pay extra to skip the line of around 300 people. It's only an additional $10 ish! You're greeted upon entrance with shots of tequila and a crazy atmosphere. Once you get inside fully there are 3 levels to the bar. We paid the cheapest price and found after going many times, it is by far the best spot. Though if you buy a bottle, it reserves you a table do u don't have to carry ur drink around all night. And if u do buy a bottle and don't finish it, u can bring it back with u! The entertainment is out of this world! Streamers, must, smokes, balloons, always something flying from the ceiling! Shows are lipsincers anywhere from Bruno Mars to Elvis to Christina aguilera to shania twain and everything in between. People of all age groups would enjoy the range of music/entertainment. Tho it's a long night, shuttle drops u off between 9-10 and doesn't pick u up til 3 ish. So be prepared! If u wear heels ull die the next day but everyone dresses to the nines, so dress up! Most acts try to get everyone on stage especially the ladies, if you get chosen to climb the tower above all and dance, FYI best not be wearing a skirt/dress at some point of being up there a big gust of air shoots out and I have witnessed many an embarrassed girls bum! But if you're down to party and want to witness the most amazing night u will ever have, coco bongo is the place!!!!!!!!I'll be back for sure!"

Our bags were searched which was good however the VIP gold tickets were and absolute rip off we were shoe horned into a plastic covered bench and I had to sit in between my husbands legs on a bench beneath him. The premium drinks were appalling nothing like any vodka I have tasted in fact it burned my throat and gave me heartburn, the waiters were rude if you did not tip on every drink, the saving grace to this place is the show itself it was very impressive, but as always the greed of the owners gets the better of them. If they had served you one bottle of premium spirits in an ice bucket with some mixers this would have made the experience so much better. "

Yes, we're older than the average person at Coco Bongo but we don't let that get in the way. We hardly ever let our hair down, but we certainly do here! $70 includes transportation from the resort and all drinks. This time we went on Wed (Ladies night, so tickets were $60). There are 3 levels. If you want to observe more than play, go to the top level. You get an amazing view of the dancers and show that way. If you want to be part of the energy, go to the main floor. There is nothing like the feeling of the cold oxygen blasting down on you or the confetti floating from the sky. If you're a female (and yes, even if you're 40), go up on the stage and dance! I don't drink a lot at Coco Bongo because I just want to dance and play and not feel sick, but if you want to drink, they will serve you until you can't stand up. Oh, one more thing, I've always been impressed by how clean the bathrooms are. It's a bar. People are drunk and throwing up, both of which usually mean disgusting bathroom. I wouldn't sit on the seat, but I didn't gag either."

If you hate crowds though you should probably stay away.. We booked Coco Bongo as one of our excursions from our resort and paid about $70 which included our transportation as well as open bar once you arrive. When we got there the lineup was massive. There was a woman selling \"skip the line passes\" for $10 so we all paid that and were let in right away. Worth it! It is so crowded in there and it can be hard to move through the crowds. If you're used to clubbing though you won't find it bad. We didn't pay for VIP because we wanted to be down on the floor in the middle of it all. I'm glad this is how we went about it but if you want to be able to sit down and not be so much in the crowd then definitely get the VIP tickets. Not sure how VIP service works for drinks but on the floor you can go to the bar yourself and get drinks. Alternatively, your best bet is to do what we did which was give one of the bartenders a huge tip as soon as you get there and he will make sure you have a drink in your hand all night long. Literally, we would only be half way through our drink and he would be there with another full tray for us. Amazing service! Another fun part of being down on the floor is being able to get up and dance on the bar. So much fun! Ladies, I would recommend not wearing heels for your own comfort! The music there is awesome and the \"shows\" going on overhead are amazingggg! I can't get over the amount of work that must go into putting it all together. I believe there are actually 3 Coco Bongos (2 in Mexico and 1 in Dominican). I've heard they are all pretty much the same though so if you get the chance to go to either of them you should take it! I would definitely go again if I get the chance!"

If i hadn't of been standing by the toilets waiting for him to return, then i wouldn't of known he got thrown out. I asked one of the guys to let me out so i could find my partner, and he couldn't understand me so he wouldn't let me out. It took me 20mins to fight my own way out! I eventually found my partner outside and down the bottom of the road. All the \"security\" men who worked there had demanded his wallet, and kicked him out as he refused to give it to them. My partner is a big built man and gave them what they desereved.. hence why they left him alone at the bottom of the road. They threatened to call the police on him too... in which he replied.. \"carry on\". Nothing else came of this as my partner stuck up for himself. I dont think the guys were expecting that and like i said... they just let him be. Spoilt our night totally!! And wasted alot of money as were only in there for 5mins. The show was very cheesey, the 1 drink i had was watered down to the max! All in all... a load of rubbish, run by mexican bullies! Heard lots of stories about this place including spiked drinks and getting robbed. If you want to still try for yourselves like we did... then still be very careful and have your witts about you!"

Definitely not to miss, believe me there is no other place like this. My advice is to pay the gold ticket if you can afford it , that way you assure the best view of the show and also a more comfortable experience, the regular ticket gets so crowed you can not move a step. there is also another option ( my favorite) which is to pay for the cover and a bottle of two of any liquor , that way you get a table aside the main dance floor, just make sure to be early so you can get to pick your table otherwise they will set you in a non view table."

Oh and we didn't have to wait in the main queue either. We kept tipping our waiter...so we were looked after incredibly well. It was absolutely packed so would definitely say get there early and wear flat shoes as it is a long night with plenty of stairs. Well worth the price. Hope to go back again next year."

The package included unlimited drinks, which with the encouragement of a reasonable tip our personal bar waiter kept us well replenished with drinks at our seats through out the night.We found the VIP area comfortably full with room to dance on the spot if you wished. The entertainment was varied with trapeze style acrobatics; comedy sketches; tributes to Queen, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9, Bruno Mars plus a pulsating Brazilian style carnival section.My wife and I are in our 50s (the audience included all ages) but young at heart, so late nights do not phase us...the show started about 11:30pm and we left about 3am, but the time raced by. We travelled with others from our hotel...one guy in his 60s at the start of the night was questioning his decision to attend, but shouted in my ear during the show that it was 'brilliant', and was raving about it back at the hotel...well and truly converted, and I guess the best advert for what a great night we had."

If you want to go to dance and be a part of it all don't bother with the whole \"gold VIP\" bit. Right the Gold VIP thing:Pros- our waiter was great. Really attentive and didn't leave us without a drink all night. His name was Dave I forget his surname. He was great. Pros- branded drinks, although the cynic in me makes me wonder. Cons- according to the website the VIP area is restricted to 120 people. No chance. They had us rammed in like cattle. So much so that a wall length bench seat with tiny dots of round tables in front they wanted 4 to a table. To achieve this we were instructed that the men should sit on the back of the bench whilst your partner sits on the seat of the bench between your legs. Resulting in two people taking up one space. Also from this view yes you can see the stage but a lot of the action happens on the dance floor on the ground floor. You cannot see this at all, for one because you are sat right up against the wall and secondly because you then have another row of people on stools sat in front of you.There are a few tables next to the balcony which would offer a good view but unless you happen to be the first half dozen in you stand no chance. We decided very early on we would not stay where we had been put and spotting some empty stools on the third landing went and nabbed them. Ok. Now we had a better but not great view and the stools were so tightly squeezed into an area I physically couldn't sit facing forward as there was no room for my legs. H&S obviously isn't a big thing here. All in all what could and should have been an amazing night was ruined by the so called VIP bit. Seems to me like it's just a con to make more money. Unfortunately I fell for it."

We booked with Thomson the Gold VIP tickets and paid \u00a397.00 for each ticket to be guaranteed seating, but this was not the case. I would like to make you aware that NO point you are guaranteed seating and the Thomson reps lied to us! We were very disappointed with the show for the amount of money paid, there are only one toilet on each floor so there is no point drinking as you spend most of your time queuing. I wouldn't recommend wainscoting your money!"

Booked the VIP Gold Member through Thomas Cook, opting for the seated area, definitely worth doing as this includes all of your drinks & the waiters are great at coming round & keeping you topped up - regardless of tips. The show is incredible & the atmosphere of the club is fantastic. I found the breaks in the show a bit irritating (largely as I am not a 'dance' music fan) & think the evening would have had more impact if there had been fewer breaks. Would definitely recommend this for a fun night out, have a siesta first, the show doesn't start until 11, we left at 3 am & it was still going strong!"

            "review": "Good night out but dont go for VIP. As you may have read in all other reviews, this is no ordinary night club in more ways than one, but not all of the for good reasons...let me explain:A fair assumption to going to a 'night club' in a spanish speaking country, even in a touristic city like cancun, is that one will get to hear some music, possibly latin, and have a chance to dance. This assumption may be slightly optimistic mostly because the club is packed - and i dont mean a little, i mean that you will genuinely have 50cm by 50cm to bust your best moves...trying to go beyond that will certainly lead to stepping on someones shoes.The music is trendy, feels like they do have a lot of love for Pitbull and Black eyed peas because by the end of the night, it felt like we had gone through all of their hits... So if thats your sort of music, you will enjoy it a little more. This is not to say that there wasn't other genres, but it wasn't a significant amount. So this may sound a little off putting, but i truly would say that the when your amongst other people, you simply get into the environment and its definitely a good night out.The shows are creative, although once you see one the rest are basically the same but differently choreographed, nevertheless they are still impressive. The skits they do in between to get people interacting are also fun and a good laugh (granted that if you get picked for any you don't take yourself too serious). If you are a lady, i would also suggest that you wear pants or think twice before agreeing to dance at the top...wont give anything away but you been warned. :-)All entries include drinks but don't forget tipping money, and if you do need to leave early or didn't get a ticket with transport, you are looking to pay between $12-$15 to get back to most hotels. The last tip i would give to have a good night is don't bother with VIP, its essentially the same experience with the exception of getting in about 20mins earlier at around 10:40 (although show doesn't start until 11sh), position yourself near a table if possible and you will basically have the same night as the VIP guests. Definitely a must if you haven't been before, but not as much fun the second time as its the same show...music and shows. If you been once, you're better of going to other clubs to mix it up."

We went to a few other hotels to attempt to collect more guests and then finally arrived at CocoBongo.Queue jumped as expected, shot of tequila on arrival, quickly shown to our seats (first floor sitting directly opposite the stage) and immediately introduced to our waiter for the evening.The show starts at 11:30pm but it doesn't feel like a wait at all. There was a single toilet upstairs which very rarely did you queue for, and the toilet attendant was brilliant.There wasn't any pressure to keep drinking, the waiter just was on point to fill up or change drinks as we needed/ wanted. Very attentive, fun and helpful.The show, wow - just wow. It's pretty much non stop from 11:30pm to about 3am. Without ruining too much of the surprise there is a massive mix of everything from Michael Jackson to Chicago and a respectful tribute to Prince. A mix of tributes, west end, circus craziness! Highly recommended!!! TIP: get the GoldMember package - it's 100% worth it. Normal ticket holders means you queue, your looking up to the first floor for the show and your crammed in like sardines. Although you get covered with confetti ..."

Loads of girls they zoomed in on (in intimate areas) were horrified and tried to cover up when they saw themselves on the big screen. Did the camera men stop? NOPE.

            "review": "Disappointed after so much hype. We spent the night at Coco Bongo, after seeing the reviews on here and a few people saying it's a must-see. We went with the gold package: upstairs seating/'free' drinks. What they don't tell you is that the seats are crammed in pretty tightly and if you're at the back (there were two rows where we were sat), your view is somewhat restricted, though you can still see the majority of what's going on on the top stage, just not when things happen on the bottom one. Also, not all drinks are free: vodka and coke, yes but a jagerbomb no: that has to be bought with a coco bongo cup which is 18 US dollars. There is also only one single toilet for all the people sat in that section so if you need to go: don't wait until the last minute as there was a constant queue.On arrival it was very busy: very much a club atmosphere. As gold guests, we got to skip the queues and were seated in the upstairs area near the bar. The show starts with lots of scantily clad women in studded bras gyrating provocatively around to music. It was very much a strip show, without the stripping! The main show takes you through various acts, basically tribute acts with people dressed up as the famous people, (badly) miming their songs. There was a good selection though: off the top of my head there was Beyonce, Madonna, Michael Jackson, the Moulin Rouge, Queen, LMFAO, as well as a Batman and Spiderman sketch. The acts last around 5 minutes each and in between each one there is around 10 minutes of music playing, with the video playing on two large screens either side of the stage. Meanwhile, two women from the audience wriggling around, doing their best 'sexy' dancing while the next act prepares to come on. If they're wearing a skirt or dress, a wind machine blows a huge gust of air upwards at a random moment, sending their skirt flying upwards to reveal.... Well, we saw a few bottoms and front bottoms last night! The audience thought it was hilarious but the girls were mortified at having their bits and bobs flashed to a couple of thousand people. We got pretty drunk and danced and sang: the selection of music is good and there was constantly music on, though we expected to see a more polished show. We didn't expect that for well over half the time that we would just be watching music videos: we have MTV for that! We were also surprised at how sexualised it was. At several points, a dwarf dressed in various costumes proceeds to simulate having sex with various people.... Very strange and quite unnecessary. The camera was panning around to women, zooming in on their chests and bums: really not quite sure what that all added to what everyone said was going to be a great quality show. I'd read that it rivalled las vegas. I've never been to Vegas but have watched shows in London that are more polished and much better quality. I really didn't want to write a bad review after all the good ones. What I will say is that with all the drinks flowing: it's more likely that people are going to have a better time! But if alcohol is needed to make something better: it probably wasn't great in the first place. It receives a lot of hype but in my opinion, doesn't really live up to expectations. It may be seen as one of the best places in Playa del carmen but then, there is nothing to compete with because there is nothing else like it to compare to. "

But staff were always shaking their tip boxes and not wanting to serve you if you didn't give them a tip also we booked through a man in our hotel who was a rep for coco bongos and we booked as gold members for our own space together which was fab but a lot of money! The man we were paying couldn't stay away from us and promised us free T-shirts when we pay, soon as we paid all our money and after he dropped us off at coco bongos in a big bus we never seen him again and never got our free T-shirts he promised! my mum was also spiked throughout the show and her bag, shoes, phone and a photo with the 'mask' was left as we had to rush her out! staff were useless so we spoke to a different coco bongos rep at our hotel as the first one wasn't in sight and he said we need to write a letter of what happened and what was in her bag and other goods she had left so we did and handed it in the next day to our rep we waited about 4 days and didn't hear anything so we went up and asked him and he said if there was anything left coco bongos would phone him so there was no point in handing in the letter!!!"

You join a separate queue and then the two queues merge onto one after passing the ticket office. We waited in line for around half an hour. Once inside we were seated on a table up high at head height. We needed to unseat the people next to us and climb up on their chairs to get to this table. The chairs were on an uneven surface meaning I toppled off it, this is before any alcohol! They then put 2 people on stools in front of us meaning we then had to unseat 4 people to get out. At this point we asked to be moved. Our second table was behind another meaning we had a very restricted view so we couldn't enjoy the show (see picture). After 40mins of frustration we then moved to the floor area which charges US $65. We much preferred this view and being amongst the party. The Coco Bongo website states that only 120 people are in the gold member area. This is a lie, there were easily double that amount of people. We got the impression that they weren't bothered about the experience people received as long as they got your money. We really had to push them to move us and they didn't want to give us a refund. We've reported this to our TUI rep, we don't normally complain but it really was a poor experience. If you want to go don't bother with the top priced tickets, it's a con and lie. You can reserve a table on the floor level with bottle service for half the price and you can watch all of the show with a better view."

We booked our tickets through a rep at the hotel and chose the Gold Member VIP package which came to $260 for both of us. It was hassle free and included transportation from our hotel, although we chose to take taxis as we wanted to go to some bars before rather than just straight to the show and didn't want to be tied down to a pick up time at the end!We were slightly apprehensive as neither of us wanted a crazy 'spring break' night out...but we had nothing to worry about! It was a fantastic night and the show was amazing, with all kinds of performances mixed with music, confetti and balloons! The audience was really varied and there was something for everyone. We had such a great time laughing, dancing and singing.We had our own table and chairs on the first floor overlooking the stage as part of our package, as well as our own waiter...meaning our glasses were never empty. After giving our initial drink order, we never had to ask for more as he was always there with a new drink...very good service. There were loads of shot girls but we avoided and these cost extra.I really would recommend this to anybody...the show itself is so impressive and there is no pressure to get involved with anything you don't want to! On the other hand...if you want to dance on the bar and podiums...they welcome it! It really was one of the best trips of our holiday."

You are lead into the arena and assigned a spot to stand if you are doing open bar. From there, you have a waiter/waitress who will literally hand you a refreshed drink every 5-10 minutes on the dot. We couldn't even finish our drinks fast enough. After 4 nights of sweet, sugary mexico drinks we had our fill for sure, but appreciated the attentive nature of the workers.

The shows throughout the night keep everyone entertained and lively. The only hint is if you have a prepaid drink service is to watch out for the shot girls. Those shots are not included in your prepaid drinks and they will try and get you to do a shot and then ask for money. Thankfully we knew this before, but we witnessed a ton of people forking out money after the fact and had no idea. Overall, I would recommend this experience to anyone visiting Playa Del Carmen."

We were led to believe our seats would be reserved and if you wanted to go down and dance you could come back and you would still have your seats. When we were taken to the area there were no tables left and then about ten minutes later we were taken to the other side of the club and they sat us down..i didn't feel I could leave and come back to the same seats as it was so busy, I doubt the seats would be there when we came back.

The only thing I can advice you is a lot better to get the regular cover. Also from Tuesday till Thursday ($75 usd) is a different price than weekend. ($85 to $ 90usd) Is 10 to 15 usd different. The VIP service is not need it plus the space you get is small and you always stand up, you don't sit cause the sits are not to comfortable. The price for VIP $ 130 till 170 usd. Dependent where you buy it. The people in the 5ave always race up the fee. If you worry about the view, don't worry cause the place is small and you can see very well. To have more fun try to be in the middle by the bar. You don't to wait for a drink and all the show is in the middle. Don't forger to hold your personal bag (ladies) and your wallet (gentleman). If you don't want to have a hart time with you stuff don't leave it in the table or bar. Always hold on it. Other than this go and enjoy it. If you don't have some one to go just call me.

They have scaled back the shows for more DJ/bar star dancing from the trashy audience girls & eliminated a lot of shows completely. They did manage to add a StarWars sequence (two actually) that were great. There was no real finale and about 2:45 am or so, they just brought a DJ on stage with girls from the audience shakin there booty. The show used to be non-stop action, but now, its more like a regular club with a few shows mixed in.They opened the Punta Cana location last year, which was amazing.

We had great seats overlooking the stage and dance floor . We had our own waiter who we tipped $5 on arrival and kept our glasses filled all evening. There was a screen with a countdown to showtime, and videos with great music of every era , with dancers on the dance floor, all very entertaining and the time passed really quickly . The actual show is several different acts dressed as the artist and miming, Madonna , Elvis, Michael Jackson and many others with a bit of cirque de soleil , all kinds of music and dancing not to mention the midget who was behaving inappropriately at every turn . The music is really loud( Paracetomol before you go not a bad idea) but makes the atmosphere electric especially when all the streamers and balloons come down. Not easy to put into words all that happens but the whole night is amazing and unlike anything you will have seen before.

Only drink they charge you for is Red Bull.So you know the show starts at 11pm and finishes at 3am. VIP have to be in by 10pm so it is a long night but it really is amazing atmosphere and well worth a visit.Final thing if you give the waiter a decent tip at the start of the night he/she will go that extra mile for you all night."

The actors, dancers and staff really put a lot of effort into the event and it really shows! Loved it!"

We turned up on 31st March with our pre booked printed eticket and the original card that was used to book as per the information requested on the ticket. We were turned away because we didn't have id(the ticket just said to bring the cc not id)and had paid $40usd round trip taxi fares for nothing. We re booked for the following night, only to find the next day that there was a free transfer from our hotel if we booked the tickets from the coco bongo rep at the hotel. In spite of having to pay twice for the taxi, we were told we didn't qualify for free transfers! When we arrived the next night we were taken to a table upstairs that was squashed in a back corner with tables in front of us. The people on the front tables were standing up so we couldn't see a thing. For 145usd per person I would expect a better view. The show was ok but it doesn't even come close to competing with the likes of cirque du soleil and is pretty much a club with some ok entertainment."

But soon after arriving, the atmosphere was enough for us to gain out second wind. What a show! What a party!We opted for the bottle service and we're happy with our choice. $100 American each got us our own table (which we thought was key) in a semi private area, a bottle of Jack, which was enough for us since we were drinking all day already, and what we considered the best seat in the house for the show. The seating area was great because we could be sitting and still have a great view, or could stand and mingle with others as we pleased. Coco Bongo was probably the highlight of our trip and I'm super glad we chose to do it. I'd recommend it to anyone who is in the area, definitely something everyone should do at least once in their life!"

He got us great seats overlooking the show on the balcony and wouldn't leave until he knew we were satisfied! Our waiter Juan Carlos looked after us from there in and he too was attentive and kept the drinks flowing. The show itself was phenomenal with loads of interaction between the performers and the guests. Limitless amounts of ticker tape throughout the night poured from the ceilings and the balloons were a real laugh too. Well done to all the staff and performers at coco bongo, we can't wait until we come back to go again. Special thanks to Bernardo for making our night extra special! The Tiptops from Wales UK"

After a coach transfer to Playa Del Carmen we were escorted up back streets to the club. Hundreds of people milling around outside trying to get in. Access is down a load of dark steps through a maze of corridors with people pushing and shoving. Eventually emerged into the club. Its far too small for the amount of people it lets in. Found our VIP area which was on the third level sitting on a high hard bench. Didnt get a drink for a whole hour. Ignored in favour of groups of young girls until David came over and looked after us. The show itself is wacky wild and disjointed.. aerial trapeze and silk artists ( brilliant).. tributes to Elvis, Madonna, Britney, Michael Jackson etc ( just dancers miming to original tracks) mixed up with Tron type animations, Beetlejuice, then back to the usual club anthems. It was an experience indeed but dont go looking for glamour or an upmarket venue. We were probably way too old for this really and the youngsters looked like they were loving it to be fair.. but it was a bit seedy ( big screen camera shots zooming in on girls guests thighs and crotches) and a bloke dressed as the Mask pouring shots freeflow down peoples throats. Overall it wasnt much different from a downmarket British club on Saturday night, minus the health and safety. Certainly not worth the \u00a3120 we paid. Only giving it a 3 for the skill of the aerial artists and our waiter David. Wouldnt recommend for over 30s. "

He said this included 6 hours, (was 6 hrs round trip, not all-inclusive for 6 hrs), Bottle Service (bottle brought to your table and server makes your drink at the table then takes bottle away, and had to keep chasing waiter to get drinks), separate seats from the standing crowd which was appealing because I couldn't stand for 4 hours (crammed in a tiny seating area with a cocktail table like sardines for 3 of us) we asked to move to where there was more room, but they said no). They just didn't care. They had our money. Transportation was included which was safe and on time. We were told we had our own private bathroom if we booked VIP instead of the $65.00 (which ended up being one toilet for a hundred females, and a bathroom attendant cleaning the seat every time the toilet was used, and slowing things down immensely, then expecting a tip each time.It was our friends birthday. We were told everyone would sing happy birthday to her, and she would be on the main screen. (Happy birthday was sang, and they brought her a shooter). Then expected another tip. Our server was tipped well, but it never seemed to be enough, and he disappeared half way through the night. Brutal. We were told all premium alcohol was included. Then in the bus we found out champagne, j\u00e4ger, and red bull were not included. Then when we got there we were told only sambuca and tequila were included. The list was getting shorter. Again mislead. This could be so much more. They don't treat their guests well, and cram people in like nuts. It's very misleading, and I asked as many questions as possible before.

My biggest complaint is that we paid for the VIP bottle service at Coco Bongo on the 3rd floor with the rest of the group. We received the bottle service but we were separated from the group and placed on the dance floor. It was AWFUL!!!!! In fact the guides that were with us and responsible for us thought we left!When we complained at the resort we were profusely apologized to and given some nice swag. But had I known that would happen I wouldn't have gone, it was like being in a mosh pit. Our server Edgar was amazing and did everything he could including leading us by the hand to the restroom, smoking balcony and the exit. If you choose to go on the experience do not wear heals!!!

Bought a bottle of vodka per table and cost roughly $450 for everything. 4 tickets and two bottles of vodka. What a scam. Transportation provided was late, got to the venue late. We were put in a horrible spot were we couldn't see the stage. We were seated across the dance floor from the other coupe we were with. We had to pull teeth to share a single little table for the four of us. Coco bongo is said to be a \"show\" and bar however the show was terrible. Nothing exciting just a bunch of dancing skits which were garbage. This place of more for a younger crowed to get drunk and dance in place since they pack you in like sardines. Approx 1000 people were there the night we were (3/18/16) My wife and I are only 27/26 and this place sucked. Between acts they love bringing young girls up on the main stage to Dry hump each other. They compare it to shows in Las Vegas which does not even come close. Please take this review for what it is. If your looking for a place to get drunk and not be able to move, this is a place for you. The one positive thing is the music they play was good however it is an Over priced over hyped place."

We opted for VIP and we glad that we did as we had excellent seats and a great view of everything that went on. The show is a concoction of music, comedy, dance, acrobatics and audience participation! Tributes to Madonna, Michael Jackson and Queen to name a few. The dances are fantastic although I am not entirely sure they are all actually women however stunning none the less and very attractive, men in particular will ove it. We went as part of a party of 4, with 2 friends who opted for the 'cheap seats' and they still had a fantastic time. All drinks are included and with the VIP you get additional top shelf brands, we did not expect to make the 3.30 am end being a bit older 44 - 52 however we still danced on the stage and threw some shapes with the best of them. All in all a fantastic night and we would highly recommend, cost around \u00a3110 per person but well worth it with out transfers included !!"

We got a table on the \"dance floor\" with no seating, big traffic waking by and knocking our table and a server who wouldn't help us UNLESS we tipped him every time.

We purchased tickets through the rep for Coco Bongo at our hotel, and I throughly recommend the Goldmember seats for a good view and unlimited drinks.I have visited Coco Bongo twice before; first time in Cancun and second in Punta Cana.Myself and 5 others purchased Goldmember tickets. The transport to and from our hotel was perfectly fine. Upon arrival to Coco Bongo in Playa Del Carmen, it definitely looks smaller and a lot more dated in comparison. Putting this thought to one side and remembering the unforgettable experiences from previous visits, we went inside. It was quick through the club and got straight in. We went up the stairs to the VIP section of Goldmember and we were put right in the corner right next to the stage all 6 of us, with two tables. Not even 4 of us could sit on the side. The place seemed full and it was evident we definitely were one of the last to arrive. We should of arrived at least 30 minutes before we did as this seemed the only option to sit. The guy who was on our coach to the club passed, so we made him aware that we were not happy and wanted to move. He said don't worry I will sort it. We did not see him for 25 minutes, nor for the rest of the night. We made aware to the security member that we were asking for the rep which was no help. During this time, the waiter who served us was great and could not do any better! Shame he wasn't serving us for the rest of the night as he worked so hard. About 40 minutes later, we moved to another section, again with 2 tables to the opposite side of the club more in the corner. The view was a lot better which we appreciated them eventually moving us! However, from then on was a nightmare. The waiter was awful. We tipped him the first few times, then he forgot about us from 12am onwards. We had 2 people next to us, on one table (bearing in mind 4 of us were stuck on one table) which were uncontrollably drunk. I am all up for a good drink and enjoying Coco Bongos, the show is amazing and nothing like you've seen before, but they were ridiculous. Falling over all the time, pushing into us constantly, falling into us when they went past. Then they tried to get more people from the below section to their area, which was out of order. Their waiter came over to us asking the four of us to move. We wasn't doing anything wrong? His attitude was disgusting. From spending over $700 I do not expect that. We then had a security woman with attitude approach us, asking for our ticket? Why? We made her aware obviously we give this ticket in when we received our wristbands. She then disappeared. We found this odd. We then asked our waiter after about an hour of receiving no drinks if we could have some. He said he had people tip him so he had to go to them first, even though we did! Not brilliant service. The show itself was great, my only criticism being their wasn't half as many acts to the previous shows we'd seen. Also their were no new acts, and also the Bruno Mars act was superb but we didn't see this here. The acrobats are ridiculously good and are a credit to the show. I just wish they would re-vamp it a little, but nevertheless, the show is unreal and a must see!The experience here was awful, when spending so much between the 6 of us for a night out I don't expect to receive the service we did throughout the night at all. I would thoroughly recommend Cancun and Punta Cana 100% more as our experiences there were faultless and amazing! Just such a shame this one couldn't be the same!"

            "review": "so good we did it twice. My wife and I have been to Mexico twice and this is the only the only place we visited on both occasions. I recommend buying tickets in advance ( we bought from our hotel reps which are not really any more expensive than buying from the venue ) otherwise you will have to queue twice, once for the ticket then again to get in. If you buy from your rep then you can get straight in. The reps will sell u either ticket only or VIP, I have done both and would recommend the VIP for first timers as this gets u a spot on a balcony which offers the best views as all of the entertainment pretty much takes place at a high level due to the stage being some 30 feet above the floor, there are also entertainers that 'fly' around on ropes suspended from the ceiling. You also get a dedicated waiter service and all drinks are included in your entry price. the only issue I found with VIP was you felt secluded from the crowd and you haven't any space to dance, the crowd on the floor looked to be having more fun but they cant see everything hence why I recommend VIP for first timers. On our second visit we went ticket only and enjoyed it even more but this is because we already knew what was going on above us so didn't feel as though we were missing out which we would have been had this been our first time. Although with entry only tickets you don't get a dedicated waiter service, all drinks are still included but you have to go to the bar first HOWEVER I found that if you give the waiters/bottle collectors/bar staff a tip early on then you get served very quickly, we even had one of the staff bring drinks over to us without asking as soon as he noticed we had empty bottles ( just give a peso tip every time he does this and it'll make life so much easier )......The dancers/performers were of the highest quality. It is so fun fun and the atmosphere is buzzing. Only thing of note is that the show doesn't start until late ( about midnight ) so be prepared for a very late night, I wouldn't recommend booking this trip if you have an early start the next day ie an early excursion or an early flight, definitely schedule a relaxing day at the beach or by the pool for the following day....youll need to get over the hangovers!"

            "review": "General Admission is a joke. My husband and I spent $70 each on tickets for Coco Bongo in Playa Del Carmen through a travel person at our hotel. Our friends had all said that Coco Bongo is amazing and we had to go. We were very excited and got all dressed up and ready to spend the night partying. Our driver was very prompt and the ride into town was fine. Once we got there they told us we could wait in the mile long line or pay an additional $10 each to skip the line and go in the entrance with people that purchased VIP tickets so we did this. As we were walking through the hallways into the club they gave us cocktails and tequila shots which were fun. Once we got to the front though we showed our general wristbands and were told to just stand to the side. That ended up being where we stayed for about an hour before we left. It was so overcrowded and we couldn't move at all. There is only one bathroom and once you are in the mix with all the people you can't actually get to it. The servers had to get through to all of the guests and had to shove their way through each time, I felt bad for them as most people wouldn't move an inch (but of course they want a drink). They have some girls from the crowd go dance on the stage before the show but when the show started these girls seemed to think they were the stars of the show for the rest of the night and kept climbing back up there so that the people on the floor couldn't see past them. After being pushed and squeezed and having to pee for an hour we decided the show wasn't that amazing to stay for and we went for some nachos and burritos close by and then started to walk fifth ave. At the end of fifth ave we found an amazing spot called the Blue Parrot. It was $10 a person to get in (included drinks for ladies but not men), and it was right on the beach. They had a fire show and later a break dancing show. There was more than enough room to dance and have a good time and it had two different DJ's and rooms and some chairs in the sand to just relax. Our friends have raved about their times at Coco Bongo but I guess they all did the bottle service packages. So unless you are a big group prepared to shell out for bottle service, I would say Coco Bongo is not worth it."

We booked for Friday evening having been reliably informed that this is the best night to go. We were not disappointed. The floor show is non stop with entertainers hanging from the ceiling, burlesque dancers performing Moulin Rouge type acts, Star Wars renditions, balloons cascading from the ceiling and much more. I have never been anywhere like that before and have travelled quite extensively. I loved it. I'm told that this is the brain child of Jim Carrey and when in Coco Bongo there is a person dressed like him with a green mask on who walks around getting his photo taken with guests.

Surprised by the positive reviews on here as it's pretty disappointing, I'm sure it's great if you're under the age of 21 and never been to a proper nightclub before or the theatre. Firstly its $60 for the cheapest tickets which is standing but free drinks and cocktails all night. They fail to tell you that there are only three cocktails to choose from and they a pre-made with cordial juice rather than real juice. I had to stop drinking them as they were too sweet and syrupy from the cordial. The next price tickets are $110 for a table which you can stand at or at best have a step to sit on by the table. The next bracket of ticket is a table at $130. The place is very busy, to the point where I think they would be shut down in the UK/US for over filling the venue and it being a health and safety risk. The service is the only good thing, the waiter was always over getting us drinks.The club puts on shows all night, probably around 7/8 of them. They are all pretty lame, I think they have 2 proper dancers and the rest they must have picked up off of the street. They try to distract you from how poor they are with all the visual effects from the video screen and by firing out confetti/balloons from canons. Don't get me wrong, the acts are entertaining enough but don't expect anything amazing like others say they are. There were two acts which were half decent at best. There is no way this is worth the entry price for the drinks that you get and as I say, the people who say this is amazing must be under the age of 21 or not seen anything else or been to any proper nightclubs before. I'd save the $120 (you'll obviously be going with someone) and spend it on an excursion or some nice meals."

Until about 11:30pm, it is just music you can dance to, but then the show begins and it never stops. It is loud, crazy and has a ton going on. The staff is great about getting you drinks and trying to keep the place clean. But make no mistake, it is jam packed in there and the alcohol is freely pouring so by the end of the night, things can be a little rowdy.

Unlimited premium drinks are available for these tickets and you get a dedicated wait staff who were very focused and attentive.

As we were enjoying our vacation one day into it, Tomas (Andrew) coco bongo's entertainment recruiter approached us and asked if we wanted to go to coco bongo. It's a night club with Vegas like entertainment and celebrity look a like performances. It was $140 for two tickets. We was to leave the resort at 9:30pm and leave the club at 3:30am. When we brought the tickets we didn't realized it was 6 hours of partying. I thought omg what was I thinking. I have a history of Lupus which is a disease that causes fatigue, joint pain etc. I thought to myself it's no way I'm going to make it through the night and I went to the concierge to cancel, but it was too late to get my money back. So I said we just have to make the best of it. Well a couple of hours after trying to cancel, Tomas came over to us and said he heard we was trying to cancel. I explain to him why I was trying to cancel as previously stated due to my lupus. Tomas told me he understood and that he was going to see what he could do for me, because I would be standing all night. However they do have tables you could purchase with a host to bring your drinks to you. I wasn't willing to spend anymore money considering I was trying to cancel. Tomas assured me we would have a good time. When we got to the club, Tomas didn't just drop us off, he was very attentive to us and made sure we were safe and taken care of. Once we were in line, Tomas went to get us checked in and when he came back he told me that he explained my situation and they gave him permission to give me and my fiance a table to sit at with no problem. I can't express enough how much that meant to me. I was extremely pleased with Tomas and coco bongo's humanity and understanding of my disability. Tomas is an excellent person and employee and I would suggest if you party at coco bonga (which you should) RESERVE YOUR TICKETS WITH TOMAS. I'm ecstatic to say that I wasn't able to get a refund for my tickets, because we had a blast!!!!! I really enjoyed myself. I felt like I was 20 again and I couldn't believe how much fun I was having and I barely sat down. We were having such a blast that 3:30 seem to come soooo fast. I will definitely go back when I go to Mexico. I love \u2661 Tomas and so did my fiance. Check out our picture we took together the next day back at the resort. I had to have one with him.

We didn't have a table and were right in the middle of everything on the ground floor.If you want to save some money, go to the bar yourselve to get your drinks.

Was really pleased we paid the extra for the VIP tickets as we were seated upstairs on a balcony, close to the bathrooms and bar with a great view of the stage and dance floor below. It really doesn't take long at all for the staff here to soon have the entire audience on their feet dancing. The atmosphere throughout the entire night was electric. The show was phenomenal, sort of Cirque du Soleil meets Moulin Rouge with a super star of a midget and lots of surprises thrown in along the way. The waiters in the VIP area kept the drinks flowing without us having to ask and the night flew by quickly and before we knew it was 4 am and we were on our way back to our hotel with sore feet from dancing but happy to say the least!Very mixed audience ranging from young adults to older clientele all having a great night out. Well worth a visit. You'll not be disappointed."

My friend and I went Gold members which is a must as you get great viewing of all the club and you're looking down instead of craning your neck to look up. On the floor it was packed solid and a couple who came on our mini bus left early because the female was short and was being elbowed and knocked all the time and she struggled to see over the crowd. Gold gives you priority entry , your own table and waiter. He was great and I can remember part of his name being Juan. We had disorrono all evening and when I knew I'd had enough he was great and just gave me water. He took us through the crowds to direct is to the toilets also. These little touches were lovely. The acts are so professional and funny too. The music is from all genres. 70s and up to dateGo and experience the night when you go to Mexico as this is the only country you will ever get to experience anything like this. We paid around \u00a345 pp with Thomson and I cannot fault them but at our hotel Ocean Maya Royale we had Ariel promoting Coco Bongo and he was so nice that we got a T Shirt and bag from him. So I believe the tickets would be a little cheaper and we would have got the same experienceJust a note that you are not allowed to take any tablets, selfie sticks etc into the club. Your bag is searched thoroughly and I had to leave my tablets and selfie stick and collect it at the end of the evening. This would have been helpful if Thomson had explained this when we purchased the tickets as it was time consuming filling out forms and the stress of whether I'd ever see them again, which luckily wasn't the case for me. Well done Coco Bongo. Can't wait to go again next year and see a different show. "

Coco Bongo is a great place to party on and dance until your feet say ENOUGH!The absolute highlight of this place is the incredible show that occurs fro 11 until 2 am!Up to 40 acrobats, dancers and actors live performing like artists such as Madonna, J-Lo and Michael Jackson. recereation of awesome movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean, cicago, Moulin Rouge... all mixed up with dancing music intervals.Great ambient... I didn't stop dancing nor my friends all night long! You have to see it to understand what Coco Bongo is! Plus we were an awesome group of friends that made te party even better!We got a server all night with drinks and water coming along all night! The girls selling shots are hilarious. Even if you don't buy any shot, they are super cool to talk to :D We hada great time!"

There are beers etc on the coach that you can pay for.The queues outside were small and we were whisked straight upstairs onto a balcony - I think it's impossible to have a bad view it's like a theatre style. We had our own mini table and the waiter would walk birng you drinks all night. They're all premium spirits from Jack Daniels to Smirnoff vodka! I think you can get premium beers too. The show is absolutely amazing and I would certainly go there again!!! You'd be mad not to go - after the show in turns into a little more of a club for a few hours until around 3am I think!"

We decided to go for the gold member so we got the vip treatment by having our own table and our own waiter who gave us our drinks all night which was great as it was extremely busy so meant we could stay together and not worry about keep going to the bar. The seats we had were great viewing on the whole venue and the stage. The music was a great mix to everyone's liking and the club was buzzing before the show had even started. The show was fab and nothing like I had ever seen before. It was a great mix of everything including Phantom of the Opera to Elvis to Bruno Mars and Star Wars. We didn't want the night to end as were enjoying ourselves so much. It is most def worth a visit and the hangover and lack of sleep the day after is bearable after such an amazing night.It's a shame the clubs are only in Mexico as we want to go again but I would def go back to Mexico again to go back to Coco Bongo.A night we will never forget!"

In fact, I believe its the best club in the world.The versatility of the show is just amazing. Great music, great acts and not to forget all the paper shreds and balloons falling out of the air.Personally, I like a spot on the floor instead of a reserved table, as you're in the middle of all the action. If you do too, don't reserve your tickets, but just go there on the night, speak to the official sales people just outside the club and buy your tickets there. You pay the same price and you can skip the line waiting outside.Go there and enjoy! You'll definitely have a great time!"

The actual show only lasted about 30 mins and we were told there was 26 acts but in reality there was about 12 or 13 and the rest of the time it was music which was mainly Mexican pop acts so we didn't know the songs.We have to say the main problem was space. We have never been so crammed in in our life. We were told there were plenty of toilets and the truth is there is only 1 and you have to fight through the crowds on the floor and that took half an hour to get there and back again. We were sold that no one would be in font of us , more lies. While the 2 min shows of each act were good we will never go again. All we will say is that anyone wanting to go there should know that even if you pay for vip tickets you will still be extremely cramped so be warned."

Show is fantastic, although waiting in line for an hour to get in or not being able to get to the bar because of the crowd would have been discouraging."

We are in our 40s and decided to buy the VIP pass to be upstairs in a table, rather than downstairs standing. I must say this was a great night! Coco Bongo is like a Disco, but also with some Vegas-Like shows. Some of them like cirque du soleil. The theme was Star Wars and they had shows where some guys were fighting star-wars like with the laser sables. Music was very good, and the overall experience was great. This place is a Must See if you come to Playa. If you would like to be sitting, but the VIP pass. It is worth it and you also get better drinks."

They were not really feeling up to going out in town but after visiting the Coco Bongo in Cancun on a previous trip I knew they would enjoy it. It is such a fun night! It's a cabaret and club all in one. I think it is enjoyable for all different ages. I would however recommend getting your ticket in a package or pub crawl to get better seats and quicker access. We did general admission this time around and waited forever and then we were squished in like sardines:( but if you tip your server well from the open bar the first round they will keep you hydrated all night and well into the morning :)"

We were told about a New Year's Eve party, which we were told \"isn't far, it's in Playa\". We were assured the party was \"exclusive\" and would be \"under-sold\". My husband wanted to go because it was Star Wars-themed so we purchased two $150 tickets. We inquired whether we could purchase a table or if it was general admission- we were told tables were already sold out. We were told a driver would pick us up and take us to the club. The driver kept us waiting almost an hour- we finally got to Coco Bongo at 930pm and we didn't actually make it in the door until 1030pm. When they said \"It isn't far\", what they meant was \"It's a 45 minute drive from your hotel\". We got in the club, which was dark, crowded, had rickety steep staircases up to the general admission areas where people who hadn't purchased tables were supposed to go. We saw plenty of open tables and asked about what we had to do to get one. We were first told we needed only to purchase bottle service, so we promptly spent $200 on a bottle of their cheapest champagne (probably $20 at the store). Then the manager approached us and said we hadn't spent enough and we were welcome to enjoy our bottle, but if we wanted a table it would be $600. At this point we decided to cut our losses and go. We couldn't see any of the performances, we could barely see each other. If this was \"undersold\" I don't want to see what a full house looks like because as it was, you couldn't move. I said to my husband \"This is the kind of place you see on the news when a fire breaks out and no one can leave and everybody dies.\" Awful. We left at 11pm and took a taxi back to our resort, making it to our hotel just in time for midnight on New Year's."

I asked if they were overselling the event or was there a limit. He assured me there was a limit and at the time we purchased the event was 87% sold. We arrived at 9pm to find a super long line, we had to wait an hour to get in the club. Once in the club we were packed in like sardines and it was super difficult to get a \"free\" drink. The service staff make it known that if you want a drink you better \"take care of\" them...basically give them a lot of money. The show was good and we had a good time once some of the other patrons decided it was too packed to stay. Despite the challenges, we were determined to have fun since we paid $900 to be there! We also tried to get a VIP table...at first they wanted 2K USD and I negotiated to 1.15K USD but thankfully both our credit cards we tried to use thought the charge was fraudulent...the only problem was that my husband and I missed the NY trying to pay for the table.

First of all if you want to be able to actually sit and watch the show you need to spend about $150 per person. We could not afford that and paid $50 per person, the minimum. We were expecting to be able to at least sit even though we didn't get a table but no you have to stand. We got there early and waited for 40 minutes, we had a pretty decent spot but we lost it as soon as we went to the bathroom. The place is small and cramped and gets filled up quick. It's definitely a fire hazard. You have to squeeze through people (who are drunk, bumping, grinding, making out) just to get to the bathroom. Security and waiters are rude and pushy, if you try to sit down they make you get up. You get shoved around if you are in their way to getting people drinks. The shows themselves were just ok. The dancers are pretty talented but they do not sing and rely heavily on movie footage. There is about 10 minutes of show time with 20 minutes of club music and cameras zooming in on random women, zooming in on their crotches, butts and breasts. It made both of us feel very uncomfortable. They would pick women from the crowd to dance on the bar but only those wearing dresses so they could shoot air up their skirts. Overall If you are not into clubs which for the most part that is all Coco Bongo is, I would save your money for an excursion."

We got tickets off the guy walking the beach and negotiated a discounted price since 10 of us were going and it was well worth the price! Words can't even describe the experience you will have when you go. Our group had a couple 50+ people and they were able to hang until 3am with us. Time goes by so quickly because they have so much going on with the shows, the music and entertainment. The price we paid included all our drinks and a waiter/waitress was assigned to certain tables and they were on top of it. They always brought 2 drinks each time before you even finished your last one. It is so safe as well. You have 2 points of security to go through. I would recommend this to EVERYONE in the area!"

This is not a typical dance club at all. This is pure wild entertainment. My only regret is not getting it on video to show my friends ack home. Words cannot describe this place - just go and enjoy. Im really not a party guy or much of a drinker. But trust me, doesn't matter. Probably the most entertaining night of my life. Tips for 1st timers: -If at a resort, buy ticket with Coco bongo sales reps. It includes transportation, drinks. Ask about getting to front of the line for 10$ extra. - go early enough to get a spot that is not on the floor. The floor is jammed an chaotic. You can go down there to dance whenever you want, but at least you will have a spot to stand comfortably to enjoy the shows. Youll see what I mean once you are there.- bring a camera!!!! I decided to leave my cell in my room."

There were a ton of people, lights, smoke and of course entertainment. It was the most amazing experience. The drinks were unlimited and free.

We booked a night in Coco bongos through our Coco bongo rep at our hotel, if I remember correctly it was about \u00a385 each but that entitled us to jump the que,free bar for the night with a waiter allocated to us and of course transport there and back at silly o clock in the morning. To be honest I was not that bothered with going but I was really glad we did.The club is spread over three floors with a huge centre stage area around a massive dance floor. The music was bouncing from start to finish. I knew I was in for a long night the second we arrived.I'd describe it as a super club and the show was spectacular. It really was a great night I don't want to spoil it for anyone but I can't emphasise how impressed I was with the show it literally had everything from Beyonce to bettlejuice, dancers flying around the ceiling it was really really impressive and so well done. The music was great easy to dance to and be warned girls you will be pulled up to dance on the stages but don't be shy go for it. By the end of the night we were knee deep in streamers and balloons it's like new years eve and mardi gras every single night. I would no correction will definitely go again just be aware that buying tickets from a rep who doesn't work for the club will get you in but you will not have a table or a waiter and will have to que if your not willing to pay the extra to jump the que. This could catch u out as the other reps don't actually tell you you will have to que or be left outside so be aware, if your going get them I suggest throwing caution to the wind and going as a gold VIP it's roughly 120 dollars (about \u00a385)but u are treated like royalty and although it may seem expensive if you have been to other super clubs then actually it's not that much plus you have added bonus of your own waiter and are escorted straight into the club and if you are anything like me on a big night out with your free bar of top shelf drinks u can easily get your money's worth,to be frank I'd pay this amount for the show alone,it really is fun.A wild, brilliant night can't wait to go again x "

We were there at 10:15pm, a little early, show started at 11:30pm. None the less the staff kept us entertained and were very attentive to our bottle service. There 3 price categories, VIP, Bottle Service and Floor. The floor group was very young and stood the whole time ($60 US). The bottle service included 1 big bottle of Grey Goose and 2 types of fruit juice to mix $85 US but room to sit. VIP was $150 US. This show included a tribute to NY show Chicago with pro dancers, tribute to Elvis, tribute to MJ, and featured all the music from 60's to current. If you have a favorite song, they will play it and dance to it and put up the Music Video on huge screens. The audience will participate on the elevated dance floor. There were lots of repeat customers, everyone seem to know what was coming, but me. I am older and stayed until 2am, they were still going, but we had plans the next day ...."

After our 3rd trip to Playa del Carmen we finally succumbed to going to Coco Bongo, we had been told so much about it that we decided to treat ourselves to the VIP Experience, \u00a380+ each, which was supposed to guarantee good seats to watch the show. We arrived about 10 pm, yes we got in faster than the ordinary queue, after the usual inspections we were led to our seats. By the time we got to our section of the club, all the front seats had been taken, bar 1, and I was asked to sit on the seat about 3-4 feet away from the front, with my wife straddled between my legs at a lower seat, both seats unable to see the mosh pit were all the dancing was happening. The show finally started and for the next 4 hours we were entertained to very loud bass music, dancing, in my opinion some of it pretty average, miming to original acts, and some acrobats in the mosh pit area, which I couldn't see due to the seating arrangements. Only one thing left for me to do was hit the bottle, which I managed to do successfully. Again I felt in the hotel I stayed at they did similar things but not to the same standard as Coco Bongo, but in the UK i have seen tribute bands perform live music close to the original sound, so did I feel it was value for money?, no, did I enjoy it?, some of it, would I recommend it, not at it's current price, however it is full most nights so maybe I'm getting old."

And canned cheering ever time they finish. The canons shooting confetti and balloons about are very affective and add to the atmosphere .THe acrobat show is very basic and seen far better in Spanish holiday resorts . can't believe some of the reviews it so over hyped as for 130 dollars for VIP try halving at and its still dear for what you get. Got there at 10 left at 3 service was good but walked out as sober as I came in. Seen quite a few leave early so guess not only one who thought it was rubbish.

When in Riviera Maya, in my case at the Grand Riviera Princess Hotels, there is one place that you and your friends have to absolutely go to, CocoBongo in Downtown Playa Del Carmen. If you want to ensure that you get the best deal, once you settle-in to your room, scope out the CocoBongo representative at your resort, they usually wear the bright yellow shirts with the CocoBongo logo on it. They are usually in a booth near the main pool of your resort, next to a lifesize statue of Spiderman holding a sign saying: \"Better than Las Vegas Nightlife - CNN\". They are usually in the mail pool area of your resort between 11am to 1pm and 3pm to 5pm. The more people you are, the higher the possibility of getting VIP treatment with bottle service, also Open Bar. The prices are better at the resort with the onsite CocoBongo rep. If you participate in your resort's main pool activities and contest, the greater chances are to win a free ticket. When you purchase your ticket, follow the advice of the representative as to shuttle service to and from CocoBongo and which lineup to get in when you get there. Above all, when you get inside, it will be crowded, so for you ladies with stiletto heels, wear a nice sexy flat shoe. Because it is open bar, you will be greeted by a waiter who will be catering to you by bringing you drinks 2 by 2. Tip generously as you feel. Normally 200 mx pesos is good. Don't bring too many valuables with you, and leave the bling back in your hotel safe. Don't flash your wad of cash, because every place has their regular up-to-no-good pickpocket who is looking to withdraw it from you. If you're a selfie junkie, please be act responsibly and be respectful of the interactive performers as they are there for everyone's entertainment. Place closes down at 3am, so be mindful of the shuttle returning you to your hotel. If you intend on partying a bit too much, don't misbehave in or outside the club. Although tourism is welcome, please note that Police is there for everyone's safety.One thing's for sure you will have a great time."

If you pre-purchase a bottle, you get a table on the main level. It's less expensive than a VIP seat (around $100 a person vs $155, depending on the bottle you purchase) and, because it's on the main floor, it's easier to join the dancing. This option is not on the website -- ask the Coco Bongo guys at your resort. Make sure you get a table on the 2nd or 3rd tier (3rd is preferred). If you get one on the bottom level there will be General Admission people standing right in front of you all night. If you buy your tickets when you get to your resort, it will include transportation. Web purchases don't seem to. I personally would not have enjoyed general admission. The floor was so packed it was hard to squeeze through when I had to go to restroom. If you are claustrophobic, this would not be the place for you. It was a fun night! However, we were under the impression there would be more acts. It's more of a dance club. About 2/3 of the time the entertainment was watching various girls from the audience dancing on the stage. Our waiter was fantastic! Was constantly getting us fresh ice and keeping our drinks filled. He watched our table for us when we went to the bathroom / got up to dance."

VIP tables are the 2 floors and everyone else is packed in the main floor space left to bump into too many tables set out.Atmosphere was weird despite their best effort to make it a party hot spot with old club bangers, smoke, confetti and balloons falling from the ceiling it's a mixed crowed. I came to dance and no one around me was dancing other then the girls who had been pulled up on the stage in the middle of the main floor. When the dancing did finally pick up closer to the end of the night (thank you drinks) there was little to no room to move around table and people.AND the part I hated most was the exploitation of the girls in the club. I'm all for you wana get wasted and take your top off you go for it you're on vacation! but inviting the girls up to dance in front of the club or on stage with a group and unknowingly blowing their skirts up without their consent...and I swear I'm not this crazy person I even though it was funny the first 1 or 2 times but it began to become old and was just a pervy way to pack the club using the girls. Also the Booty cam all fun and games the first couple times and then got creepy again and unnecessary. Crazy party acts happen on their own just add tequila you don't need to use these girls to fill your club."

The dancers there were amazing, very good atmosphere. We had gold member tickets which ment you had all inclusive drinks while there which were brought to you by a waiter, you also got to enter the club first and had a table and chairs. The tables were situated quite close together which ment you had to be carful when dancing as there wasn't much room. Inbetween the acts they got girls up on the bar and on the stage to dance which was hilarious to see there shock when they sent a shot of air up their dress or skirt. Overall a very good night out!"

It was pretty packed but we found a nice spot near a rail on the second level where we could see the entire place. I would definitely visit go again the next time I'm there."

The coaches drop off at the bus station of playa del carmen and it's a short guided walk to the club. If you don't want to queue for 45mins pay to $10 USD fee to skip the queues. Trust me! Once in you are given a quick pat down by security and then given a few shots whilst you are shown in. The actual club is set on 3 floors if you really want to be in the action get the cheap seats on the ground level. Your view is a bit restricted but another tip is stand as far back from the ground floor bar as you can and you will be fine. The show itself is fantastic! Very good......well put together and elements of it had me stunned at the quality of their performances. The drinks aren't watered down and as a result we ended up very merry! Buses leave around 03:40am but local cans are ready and willing to get you home but watch they don't hike the price if they think you've had enough drink to be an easy target And don't fall for the \"I don't have change\" they will push their luck......The club itself is clean and I'd 100% go back.

            "review": "Best. Night. Ever.. We had been told that this place rocks before we went to Riviera Maya and as a result booked a night there through our Tour operator- VIP access, no queueing, waiter service and a private seating area. After that we saw a few reviews on here that weren't so complimentary - some gripes about safety, how busy it was, etc etc and we started to wonder if we had done the right thing.We needn't have worried, it was a fantastic night. On a practical level the VIP access was the way to go. There was no queue, We were escorted to our seats and were introduced to our waiter for the night. We tipped him at the start and the drinks kept coming. The ground floor level did become very busy but its not that big a place and the emergency exit was clearly illuminated and even accounting for the number of people in the club I had no concerns about egress in an emergency situation. In addition there was security looking after all levels of the club. We were well looked after drinks wise as were all the people near us and although I was merely tipsy at the end of the night my partner was certainly feeling the effect of the regular drinks service so there were no complaints in that dept. either.We both thought the show was fantastic and the atmosphere that all the staff, dancers, waiters, busboys, entertainers created kept us going through the night. The highlights for me were the Spiderman/Green Goblin set and the Michael Jackson tribute.Best tips from me are - choose a VIP package that gets you a table and drinks service, don't opt to go to Coco Bongo for just an hour - do the full night to get the full experience, and go prepared to relax and enjoy it.Only downside and this is not really a Coco Bongo issue - we booked the night via Thomson, our tour operator and travel to and from our hotel was included but on the night the coach left us without further instruction at the Bus station with the bus driver merely using a lollipop sign to indicate what time the bus would be leaving later in the night. We then had to make our own way to the club, it wasn't that far but the only reason we even knew where to go was we had been in Playa Del Carmen a few days before. This is a small issue which we overcame but some guidance from a Thomson Rep might have been nice.All in - just do it. We were skeptical and nightclubs of any kind are not normally my thing but this was just - WOW."

Than I found a bartender and he placed us by the bar where he said he was going to be all night. Which he was....gave him $20 tip after the first beer and our glasses where never empty. All the money spent was worth it and cheaper than a bar back home. Now the show....show was really good. Yes can be a bit cheesy but it was very fun. Only problem...the stage is quite high...so if you're on the floor prepare to have neck issues! lol It was a super fun night...maybe too much fun because the next day sucked!

First of all, if you book through your hotel or any company operating from the hotel, ask them where you will be dropped off. We were picked up 30 minutes late and dropped off at a bus depot and just left! Had no idea where to go and just followed a crown and found it, after walking through a massive pond (left by tropical rain!!). Either get a taxi or a bus service that will take you there. Getting in there as an absolute nightmare, nobody knew where to go, everyone closed in and not knowing what to do or anything. A lot of people were getting frustrated. This is case if you are VIP as well as normal tickets. We eventually got in and the fun eventually began. The drinks are readily available and just ask or tip a waiter and you are sorted for some time. The shows are fantastic and when they break which isn't for long, the music to dance to and the atmosphere is amazing. It does get crammed when not in VIP and at one point just getting pushed one way by people then another by waiters with drinks so I would definitely recommend the VIP tickets. Would definitely go back but in the VIP area."

We had the Gold member tickets which meant we skipped the queue outside, got plied with alcohol on the way in and were given reserved seating above the crowds with a better view of the show. This was well worth the money as we had a seat and not sure my 37 year old legs could have coped with standing up all night! HahahaWe also had a never ending supply of drinks during our show, both local and premium, a few dollars tip every now and then meant that our glasses were never empty. The servers work so hard! Oh and the gold member section has their own toilets, nice and clean and I never had to queue. A lovely lady named Alicia worked in there, she was fab. Look out for her and tip her a few dollars too if you can, she does an excellent job.The time flew by and before I knew it it was 3.30am and time to go!!

At first we were just paid for the regular tickets, but when we got there we asked if it was possible to upgrade to VIP section. Fortunately there were spots left and we paid the extra for that section. It was worth every penny. As soon as we got in we were seated at a table and our waiter Brandon came over and introduced himself. He was very attentive and made sure we had what we needed. I must say the staff here are very quick and efficient. After confetti was released, staff were cleaning it up right away. Staff worked hard to ensure the place was kept clean. The only downside is that some of the shooter girls can be a bit pushy. This can be annoying when you are trying to watch the show. I would definitely go back. As far as I am concerned no trip to Playa del Carmen, Cancun and now Punta Cana is complete without going to Coco Bongo. If you like to dance then the regular tickets is the best option for you. If you just want to enjoy the show go for the VIP. And if you are concerned about being out late, don't be. You will have so much fun at this show you will forget about the time."

We're not huge partiers but had heard good things about it and decided to try it out. We bought Express tickets, which allowed us to bypass the line to get in, and it was TOTALLY worth it. We got in before the crowds hit and met one of the servers, Garcia, who took fantastic care of us for the rest of the night. Even when it got extremely busy in there, Garcia kept us constantly supplied with drinks, and he even brought us over to a spot where we had a good view of the stage and show. THANK YOU Garcia for the fantastic service you provided us- you were amazing!!Just a note for newcomers; we bought our tickets through our Resort and had shuttle service included to and from our resort. Beware that we did not return to the resort until 4 AM! If you want to leave earlier than that, you have to pay for a cab. The time went by pretty fast, as the entertainment is pretty good, but you're on your feet for the whole night, so this place won't be for everyone. It also gets VERY, VERY crowded, so this is not a place for claustrophobes.Overall, we are glad we went to Coco Bongo, and we want to make sure Garcia gets rewarded for his fantastic service!"

Ok we were at hotel and there was this coco bongo kiosk and the guy selling us this package in order to go on Halloween which we thought it could be great, after all we have read about coco bongo but it was absolutely the worst decision ever, I think maybe it was because of Halloween I hope nobody has experienced what we did, it was an extremely long queue just in order to get inside and guess what!! There was absolutely no space to dance or just to walk inside, free bar? Oh yes if you hopefully find a nice barman that could bring you drinks, hopefully I found him but it was completely stupid to be there in order to be just on your foot not even dancing not even watching the show, just trying to find a place where you don't interrupt anybody else 70 dollars, absolutely not worth it for such a nightmare and not necessarily talking for costumes Hope everybody takes note of this because maybe show is good but if is some particular day like Halloween you should think it 1.000.0000 times before going"

Don't get me wrong it was still a great experience but don't see what all the fuss and hype is about. The place is actually tiny which was quite a suprise, nothing how it appears in photos/videos so shows what a good camera angle can do. Goldmember package consisted of queue jump (still had to queue), table (bar stool at long bar overlooking dance floor sat shoulder to shoulder with other customers), free bar (poor local spirits etc but as expected with \"free bar\"). Dancers were good however just lip syncing/performing identical routines to films/artists shown on screen behind them in my opinion not far off the entertainment provided at our hotel every night just with better costumes & special effects. Confetti cannons, smoke, streamers and balloons were entertaining first few times but once they went off for the 5th time in about an hour couldn't really see the point. Guys that operate cameras which project images of the crowd onto the big screen focusing on the same 3 girls chests and short skirts all night. Funny the first time but bit tedious after a while. Seemed to be a lot of young American partygoers too. Nothing against them and it was great to see them having such a good time but perhaps the fact that US drinking age is 21 and over the novelty of being in a place like coco bongos and being able to drink alcohol would seem pretty exciting! This review makes me sound like an old grump that doesn't know how to have a good time! I'm really not, I just expected a little more after everything I had heard!"

I would call this a joke but it wasn't funny at all! Yes, we got a table... a table with layers of people stacked above us so that drinks and debris could be dropped on our heads and poured down our backs all night. The place is beyond over crowded. You literally cannot move at all. You cannot get anywhere because of the volume of people packed into this small space. You can't get to the restrooms and you can't even get to the exit. They make you get there at 10pm but the \"show\" doesn't start until around 11:30. Then once it starts, you have about 10 minutes of show with about an hour of music in between before the next 10 minutes of show. We made it about 3 hours and we just had to get out of there. It was a nightmare trying to get out when there are so many people that are all tightly packed in but we made it. I observed several others who were panicked trying to leave also.I would strongly suggest that if you aren't 18 years old, you think you're going to see a show or you aren't looking for a rave.... Stay Away From This Place!!!!I can't believe that I paid good money to be treated like this!!"

What they and Coco Bongos don't tell you is that there are still huge numbers of people in this queue meaning we had to wait outside in torrential rain while the queue lessened. The actual show is a complete con. For the money paid I would expect a high quality entertaining show but what you really get is 2 minutes of performance followed by approximately 15 minutes of nightclub music. The performances are outdated and poorly executed. We seen better aerial acrobatics in our hotel and even items such as Batman and Bane and Spiderman were overly drawn out and amateurish. The only positive I can say is that the barman, waiter and toilet attendant in our standing balcony area were excellent, and you do get plenty of drinks. However this did not make up for the awful show and we ended up leaving over 90 minutes before the end."

You have to enjoy crowds though, as it gets really crowded. Its not like just \"going to a club\"....this is a constantly entertaining show, with lip-synch celebrity impersonators up on an elevated stage, so it's easy to see (for short people like me). Actors on aerial fabric and zip lines come right into the crowd. Don't expect to get intoxicated on the \"all you can drink\" premise....the drinks are watery, off-brand and few and far between. Your waiter is not exactly attentive,( unless you pre-tip) and there is a LOT of pressure to buy \"bottle service\" at $200 US a pop. With bottle service comes mixers and a small table, so you have a place to put your drinks, and basically a place to stand on the stair-like viewing area. One tip--definitely pay the extra to NOT wait in the entry line, which snakes down the street for an entire block. The show goes for about 3 hours, then its house music until 4am. But hey--where else can you dance on the bar with Batman? A lot of fun, but might not be for everyone unless you are a people/party person. I, however, love the show and will be back."

            "review": "Best club & show experience ever! MUST DO IT ONCE!. What a fantastic show and night spent at Coco Bongo. We didn't do this as part of a tour, nor did we book through a hotel. I thought I'd write a review to answer all of the same questions I struggled to answer when reading through previous reviews. Note we are three 25-35 year old females, not big drinkers, and frequent visitors of other shows and Vegas. 1) Is it worth it to go on a weekday? We went on a Tuesday night and the place was full and the atmosphere was amazing. You'd never know that it wasn't a Friday or Saturday night, the crowd and staff were all there to have an amazing time. It was full but not packed. I'd be reluctant to go on the weekend given how full it was on a Tuesday (comfortably full but not sardine-full :)). Did not feel like we were missing out at all. 2) Which ticket should you buy? I was very confused reading through hundreds of reviews where some people said that the VIP area looked \"boring\" and \"outside of the action\" and everyone in VIP saying that they're glad they were on the second level away from the action. I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend a third option that is not available on the website. Go to the venue to buy your tickets (the staff outside are very helpful) and buy a \"bottle\" table instead of floor ticket or VIP ticket. These tables are in the middle between the floor (where you're forced to stand for the whole show) and the VIP (out of the action) and i think they are the best of both worlds. You get to enjoy all of the things falling from the ceiling throughout the show (incredible) but you can sit or stand in your own personal area. The staff are very careful to stop anyone with a floor ticket entering this area. We had three people and bought a bottle of Absolut Vodka. Our tickets were only $78USD and I think they were the best seats in the house. The only difference is that these tickets do not include the open bar (although when we were dancing the staff gave us many free drinks!) so this is the only thing to be wary of if you think you will get through a whole bottle of alcohol! These tickets are also fully inclusive of tips, and because you can pour your own drinks, no need to worry about fighting to get to the bar, or waiting for someone to get you a drink. 3) What to wear? This is a beach town but I was fairly surprised at how casually dressed many people were (shorts and singlets acceptable). Dress for comfort. The venue has great air conditioning.4) When to arrive? We got there at 9.45pm to buy our tickets. We were the first in line for VIP entry (note that bottle entry also gets you fast tracked). Highly recommend getting there at this time. There are three tiers of \"bottle\" tables in between the floor and the VIP area. Get in early and get a table on the highest level away from the floor. Perfect view of the action. Overall this was an amazing experience. It is not that the acts are more incredible than what I've seen elsewhere, nor was it that the clubbing experience alone. It was the brilliant combination of all of the elements, coupled with an outstanding team of staff who create an incredibly fun atmosphere. A huge shout out to our waiter Carlos. He was constantly topping up our ice and drinks, and looked for us when we returned from the bathroom to help us back through the crowd to our seats. Amazing.We were there from 10pm - 3.30am and as everyone has said before me, the time flies. Don't plan too much for the day after!! :)"

We couldn't enjoy the open bar we paid for. It was shoulder to shoulder people on top of each other. Maybe this is just because it was a Saturday and a holiday. We had to pay $25 to get a cab back and $140 for the excursion. We were never refunded any money after our complaints. Don't go. Their staff harass you at all the resorts in the area. It is a waste of time."

We had the bottle service (at around $3000 pesos, with the free ticket) and a table included with this price. The coach picked us up at the hotel at around 9.45pm and took us to near the venue. It is about a 2 minute walk from the bus to the entrance. The only reason for this is that is pedestrianised. We were welcomed at the entrance and given wrist bands. We were shown inside by our guide and then left to the staff to do their thing! Our sever/friend Habero was absolutely outstanding. As per previous reviews our drinks were never empty and even showed us to the toilet! The show was mesmerising. People say that it is a few acts followed by lots of filler. This is partly true but I think it was a really good balance. There were loads of acts and each one was really entertaining. Not getting into detail but I really believe there is something for everyone. Would definitely recommend this place. A final thank you to Jesus at the Princess Platinum for the amazing service. If you stay here book with this guy!"

Once we got to our hotel and found our Sunwing representative we had him contact Coco Bongo to take our reservations for the night that we wanted to go. We stayed at Akumal Bay Beach and Wellness Resort and our pick up from the hotel was at 9:30 pm. A coach bus arrived right on time Friday evening and we were the first ones on it. Then we stopped at two other hotels to pick up 6 more people. We got to Coco Bongo 45 minutes before the show officially started and they have a countdown on the big screen. Our pick up at the end of the night was at 3:20 am and the time just flew by while we were there! They drop you off and pick you up at the bus depot down the street and tell you what number to be at. Also there is free WiFi here which was amazing! Upon arrival we were given a welcome drink and a shot of tequila on our way to our seats! Definitely gets the party started. I definitely recommend opting for VIP so you have a seat, I don't know how people can stand and watch the show all night. The service was great during the show and we never had empty drinks. The bartenders were loading me up with shots every time I walked by to use the bathroom. There was only one bathroom stall for girls with a bathroom attendant who was amazing. After each use she would clean the whole stall for the next person. Smoking was very inconvenient here as it was on the opposite side of where we were seated and its up a set of stairs that leads to a balcony outside.They pull girls on stage all the time and it is the most exhilarating opportunity, so don't be shy! They loved me and my friend so we were up there at least 5 times. I'm so glad I finally got to experience Coco Bongo and I will definitely go back if the opportunity presents itself, or maybe I'll check out one of there other locations. It's an experience that is best left for your own experience, but it definitely doesn't compare to anything else you will find in North America. Go, enjoy the show and have the time of your life!"

The shows are amazing you won't be bored this is not your normal standard nightclub, the drinks are good, the service is top notch our barman was lovely make sure you tip and he'll look after you well.

It was a hell of an experience. Loved it. The dances. The songs. The atmosphere. The drinks the service. All impeccable. Make sure you take a good amount of money with you though as you can buy a picture there that comes in a cool frame and also you will want to tip your waiter at the end. TIP - Book the gold or vip package from your hotel rep. You get better seating and a table which adds to the comfort and experience.TIP - Mare your own way there by taxi, don't get the bus that is sometimes provided by the hotel. Get there before everyone else and you are given the best tables with the best view.They cover dance music to Jackson to James Bond to Tom Jones. I hate old music but trust me... this was amazing.

It's a very busy night club, especially on the weekends. Drink prices are about average for a resort destination, comparable to U.S drink prices, but someone needs to pay for the band every night. But if it isn't happening for you at your resort, you won't be disappointed here. Before you start drinking and having fun, write down your resort name and address and phone number as well as your room number, just to ensure if you are unable later to remember, you have something to give the taxi driver so you make it safely back to your resort."

The rep advised up to get a taxi (30 min journey) rather than wait for the bus. So we arrived early at about 10.15 to get good seats. At about 11pm my partner went to the toilet and never returned back. After about 20 mins of waiting I went to look for him, to be told by security he had been chucked out and wasn't allowed back in. I asked for the reason to which 3 members of security couldn't give me. So after spending $130 my partner didn't even get to see any of the show! I later spoke to him when he got back to the hotel and he said that 3 security guards had grabbed him by the wrists, asked him where he was staying then threw him out the door and wouldn't let him come back in to even find me. So just a warning to anyone going as a couple, never leave each other's side or you will be left on your own."

We were thoroughly satisfied with our seats...it gets busy, but we always had a great view and just enough personal space.The shows were almost on par with Cirque du Soleil - and the variety was amazing.

Just back from a what was a lovely family holiday to Riviera Maya apart from the bad experience my son had when he visited Coco Bongo with his brother and their girlfriends, they bought VIP gold member tickets from our thomson rep at the beginning of our holiday but because of high demand couldn't go until nearer the end of our break,The rep advised that they get a taxi to playa del carmen instead of the using the courtesy bus as it would get them there quicker and avoid queuing, they arrived about 21.30, they were given a drink when they first went in and then given another 2 drinks at their VIP seating area, my son and his girlfriend went outside for a cigarette and when they came back in she went back upstairs and he went to the toilet, a security guy (bouncer) came up behind him grabbed his wrist, asked where he was staying said he had done something wrong and told him he was being put out, he asked what he had done but was not given an answer, when he asked again another 2 bouncers grabbed him by the wrists, ripped his VIP wrist band of and threw him out, he was never given an answer, when he didn't appear back upstairs his girlfriend went to look for him, she asked the bouncers if they'd seen her boyfriend and the said he'd been put out, they could not give her a reason for this either, he hadn't been able to contact the others on his mobile because of the signal so had to get a taxi back to our hotel on his own, I wonder after to speaking to others and hearing that this has happened to people they know if there is some kind of scam where the bouncers can sell the band on at the door for a for a nice little earner, it cost $120 for the VIP gold member and my son was lucky to be in the place for 45 mins, he was totally gutted but what can you do when your on your own with 3 burly guys round you in a foreign country, we reported the incident to our rep who said she'd look in to things for us but I'd like to add Please be aware of this if you intend to go when your on holiday and try to go around in pairs and nowhere especially the toilet on your own !!!"

I'll start with the alcohol- it's included which sounds great but the only offer horrible well alcohol, the drinks were truly terrible and it took forever to get one. They do sell better quality alcohol and shots however in my mind I just payed for an all inclusive experience and I couldn't justify paying more. They have a designated server who will come around and take a drink order and then return with your drinks, hopefully with 30 minutes. They pack the place way past capacity, you are literally on top of on another. Definitely not a good place for someone with claustrophobia. I found myself looking for fire exits and hoping I wouldn't be trampled if I needed the use them (of note I was not able to find them). The show is sub-par. A lot of acrobatics putting on renditions of classic american TV /movie / pop acts, the acrobatics were pretty good. Towards the end of the night when everyone is boozed up things get much more wild, people clear out so your have more space and its a little more fun. It's right downtown so it's easy to get to and near shops and restaurants, they have lots of cabs in the area so transportation is easy as well. Would I do it again? No. Would I recommend it? No. However it wasn't a horrible night and I did eventually enjoy myself."

Be careful who you book with though, we bought tickets through our rep which included return transfers, when we left the club however our driver didn't arrive to take us home and we ended up having to get a cab home!"

Well first off let me just start off by saying that from what I remember I had a fantastic time... because I only survived until about 2am, thank god for my girlfriend. We bought a ticket package from our resort to Coco Bongos. It was quite cheap if I remember correctly - around 60USD for No line no cover all you can drink. Well anyway I guess there was a more expensive package because when we got to the club (the lineup was insane couldn't see the end), we went up to the bouncer but turns out we had bought the package where you had to wait in the mile long lineup because it was not a VIP wristband.Anyways, luckily for us we met some people on our bus ride to the club who did have the VIP wrist band and somehow I convinced the bouncer to let us in with our newly founded friends. We predrank at the resort (big mistake) not realizing about the open bar at the club so when we got in we were not expecting to drink as much as we did. Anyways the club is great, the shows are amazing and very well done. Music directly correlates to the shows they have on. The good and bad thing about this club is that as soon as the servers who walk around see that your drink is empty they make sure your cup is filled again or that you have a shot in your hand. By around 1:30am I was beyond drunk and by 2am we had to leave the club. I did not pace myself as I was no expecting to be handed so many drinks. Luckily my gf was not as drunk as me and we got back to the resort safe. The shows go on until around 5-6am is what I heard and I wish I could've stayed for that but oh well there is always next time!! I had a blast though!! Met some people there from my hometown!"

Our taxi from our hotel was at 9.45pm, whilst waiting for it to arrive I stated to my wife that I couldn't see us lasting until our pick up at 0330am. How wrong was I! Security to get in was reasonably tight, there was also a Police checkpoint outside! We had booked a v.i.p. ticket, all our drinks were included, we were shown to a upper balcony level that had seats and overlooked the dance floor and bar! I am not going to say much about the show as I don't want to give too much away! But I have to say the whole night was truly amazing, it covered every era of music so appealed to everyone, with a touch of cirque du solely and big shows! I really can't say enough about it, my wife was even dancing on the bar at one stage along with loads of others. A not to be missed night out, well worth the money!"

            "review": "Rough Start but int he end Worth it all!!! Great time. Went here for my wifes birthday last week. Definelty splurge for the VIP Gold Member package if you dont you could be standing on a line with 1200 other people waiting to get in unless you grease the bouncer at which point you might as well pay the 150 USD for the VIP Package. Its worth it, FIrst off you SKIP THE LINE int he begining but before we get to that lets talk about some of the hicups.We paiud extra for transportation form my hotel. While the bus ride was enjoyable. The bus DOES NOT take you to COCO BOngo they tell you they do but trust me they dont. They take you to a bus temrinal down the road form it, at which point they ask that you please walk fast and bvy walk fast they mean run because the area is bad. If I were you I would just take a cab direcktly here to the front because once I got off the bus I could tell if we staryed formt eh pack we would be picke doff byt he locals. SO we stayed witht he pac, I had my wives flats so she could wear her heels inside. make sure ladies brign flats for this dangerous sprint to make it to the club untouched. Anyway once you actually make it there and your name is on the list for VIP you go in, but here is hte next problem., I dont know what it is about mexico but they want copies of driver slicense and Credit card you used to pay for the gold palkcage before going in then they make you right on a piece of apaper and sign it that you authorize them to charge you for VIP package. THis entire process took well over 30 mintues since I had a gorup with me its annoying what if we didnt have hte ctedsit cards or the numbers di not match due to fraud and we change dour cards, sicne I bought the VIP package 6 months ago for that date that was a real poissibility, they said if the numbers do not match youa re not going in. This is maddness and its crtazy and they really need to rethingk that poliocy cause HAd I not had my card with me ther eis no way I paid 150 a person tog et in and your telling me im not. They should tell you ahead of time you WILL need your credit card. Anyway once your passed all that drama comes the next phase, if you have a big group it will coimplicate things, if its small then you should be fine, but basicallyt once I finally made it throught he crowd and up tot he VIP area allt ehs pots were basically gone, when I did granb a spot ont eh side I was told I could only have 2 tbales, seirousl 2 tables for 13 people, I was forced the grease the waiter into letting get two more tables and althoguht it took some \"incentives\" he agreed to let me have the tables. once everyone finally got in and we were seated. we got our first round of drinks and the show started.Once you are all settled in and you get your drinks and the show starts the FUN begins and let me tell you despite everything I went through to get in there this place was well worth it. IM sure there is some sort of fie code stuffing 1200-1400 people in that small place, it snot big by any means videos make it look big but its not. I still had an awesome time, and in the end my wives birthday was celebrated and our waiter Took care of us and made sure that my wife felt special on her birthday by having the place the entire who stooped to sing her happy birthday!!!. In my book once he did that he earned those tips lol. so Lesson learned take care of the barmen and waiters and they will take care of you. All in all great place and I would definitely go again."

We headed out shopping on Fifth Ave and nearby areas. We headed back to Coco Bongo at 10 pm. (Of course leaving our shopping conquests with our hired taxi driver. Bag checks are conducted before you get in, good job!!!You get 3 shots drinks on your way in. All ready to swing the moment in there. Show starts at 11.30 pm . Lots of cams on audience and you can see everyone is enjoying the night. Great shows and awesome lightings! Tips: make sure you head for restroom before the party start.

A couple of things:1. They try to sell you a ticket for 70USD that covers drinks up to 3,30am, and tell you thats the only ticket available. But that's not right. You can also buy one ticket for 30USD that doesnt include drinks. Nonetheless, if you drink more than 3 drinks per night, which you will, then it is worth to get the 70USD one. 2. Their drinks are watered down. So please remind the bartender to add a bit of more poison and less lemonade :-)But this is AWESOME. Go please."

I say placed as you are bundled in and strategically manoeuvred into where they want you to sit as obviously want to maximise amount of people can get in and boy do they pack em in! Have to say when requested we were moved to much better place and did end up having fun night. Would have complained bitterly re premium price entry if had been left where put! You need to be aware that even when sat with a table this is shared by many and you are tiered so cannot see everywhere including down to ground floor easily but you are on same level as stage. If went again would want to go by cab so could leave when wanted as 2am would have been end of night for us but had to await our transport back to hotel with very very merry friends from across the pond. Got in 5.15 am so far too late for us. This wasn't anything to do with the club but the choice we made of getting there. The guys in club I have to say are very courteous though and respectful of our middle age group! I did think the club caters for all ages really well with the music and shows. I think the claims of \" better than any Vegas show\" is arguable but I guess they mean for a club? This does not compare to the Vegas shows we have seen as this is dancing and performing the tribute way! It is a visual and auditory treat - a bit corny in places but entertaining mostly. A little repetitive however with the special effects and snippets of cirque de soleil type acrobatics. Talented none the less. Be aware of the ladies going round with shots - make sure you realise this is an expensive piece of what some would describe as \"titilation\" fun! They do make it clear though with neck boards advertising the price and are not pushy with it. Very safety conscious environment and efficiently deal with drinks spillages and are non judgemental re this. Wouldn't like to experience when at full capacity though and wouldn't like to have been on ground floor for sure so despite the overpricing in our opinion of this venue ( but we don't drink loads) it is a one off experience that am glad have seen and done and would recommend if doing and you are of a fifty something age group definitely do the gold member entry."

Supposed to have the best seats but they were not we were upstairs right at the back squashed like sardines. All inclusive premium drinks that's questionable. You have a waiter who my husband went to tip after the first round and he was rude enough to turn his nose up at the two dollar tip, we took plenty of tip money but was told you need to pay 40 dollars upfront to your waiter to get good service. I tip for good service but I wasn't doing that. Only stayed hour and half that was enough."

The 3 1/2 hour show, starting at 1130, has about 45 minutes of actual performance. The performances aren't great, nothing I've haven't seen before. The 'hot' girls in the audience seem to be the show, with the camera zooming in on them, and some being put on stage. We got bottle service, which stops you having to go to the bar, on advice, and although expensive this seemed like the best option. It's something I would never go and see again, but unfortunately it's something that the tourists have to do!"

We were seated on the balcony, would not recommend going on the dance floor as it is packed and you can barely move. We had a package which meant we were able to jump the queue, had our own waiter so never had to struggle to the bar for drinks. The show itself was great, fast pasted and really professional. My husband really enjoyed playing up to the cameras that flash around the crowd right throughout the evening.

The place was crowded, but the show was simply amazing. There is so much energy in the acts and it keeps your attention from start to finish. The best way to go is to purchase your tickets from the resort, this covers the bus ride there and back (although you can take a taxi back for US$25), admission, and all your drinks are covered for the night. We had a valet assigned to us, took us to our area and his service was just phenomenal. Every time my drink got to being almost finished, he was right there, taking the almost empty glass from my hand and replacing it with another ice cold beverage! I have never seen such service before, and that lasted all night! If you've watched Jim Carey's \"The Mask\", you will appreciate the whole concept. If you haven't, watch the movie before you go, and you will realize what makes this place so special!"

The principle feature of the evening is a spectacular show that takes plac from 11:15- 2:15 a.m. With the VIP Gold entrance you are whisked away from the long line and taken to the upper levels. The show takes place on the upper level, so the higher up you go, the better the view. We were fortunate to receive a very small table for 2 , and there are few. With this ViP Gold you have a waiter with private service, who will even walk you through the crowds, to use the ladies' room."

We were collected by the transport at our hotel as agreed with the Coco Bongo reps checking the ticket on 2 occasions. When arriving at Coco Bongo we were told to get in line I showed the reps the ticket with Express Pass clearly wrote but was told I would need to pay an extra $10 to get the Express Pass. I was not happy so decided to just wait! When nearing the front another Coco Bongo rep approached to swap the ticket for our wrist bands we were advised that we would need to pay an extra $10 as we were only charged standard weekday rate and as it was Saturday it was extra!

Unless it is lady's night on Wednesday (crowded!) or the weekend (more crowded because of the Mexicans, also more expensive $$$)2. Go with the animation staff of your resort.The transportation is included and safe. You will have a reserved spot only for the people from your hotel with a designated waiter. (We paid 55US in September 2015). We also arrived at 10:30 PM, which is 1 hour before the beginning of the show. Music is playing and the open bar has started!3. Tip your waiter.You want to enjoy the open bar, you need to tip your waiter. But not any waiter, the one that will introduce himself as your waiter. When he will bring your first drink, give him about 5$US per person, 10$ for the couple. He will bring you drinks all night long without you needing to ask! At the end of the night, if you enjoyed even more the service, feel free to give him a little bit more!4. The after show (after 2:30 AM) --> Tips for party people!Sometimes, it is a little crowded so you may not enjoy the open bar as much as you wanted (except if you have a designated waiter). But after the last performance at 2:30 AM, most of the people leave. But after 2:30, the Coco Bongo turns into a big nightclub! Everybody loves the show! That's for sure! But what I remember the most is the after show! It is still open bar until 3:30 AM, there aren't lineups at the bars anymore and the waiters are still serving. You have space to dance, and only party people are staying! That is the perfect time for singles to hook up!"

We had standard standing tickets and we were very satisfied! From me dancing on the bar top to having front row view of the shows. The people with tables in VIP looked bored. You can't mingle much because they don't allow much people in those sections. So you party with who you came with. If you only want to watch the show or watch other people have fun then I recommend it. But the lower level is for dancing, dancing and more dancing!! The bottle service is a waste of time. Only do it to impress someone. There are servers everywhere.. We had one friendly server check on us every now and then just tip them well so they'll come back. I stood the whole time I didn't mind.

I dont think we got picked up till 3am.. at 27 & 35 we are probably like an old married couple now but we were ready to go bk to the hotel at 1am lol!It is a must see though si definitely go and definitely pat vip otherwise you are stood up on a crowded dance floor for 6 hours with crazy drunk kids lol and the queues for the bar were crazy long.Fab eve wouldn't go again but did enjoy it!"

We were a group of over 50 ppl and we had bought our tickets from an official CocoBongo employee. the deal was 65$ per person and they had guaranteed us chairs and tables. Finally we had to wait over an hour in a line up while other groups were let in, they made a fuss about one extra person even though we were ready to pay for her, had to pay the staff for every chair they brought and acting as if they were making us a great favor, place was way over packed, to the point that some were concerned for their safety. As far as the show itself though, it was great and they have very talented performers, thank god for that cause thats the only thing they got right at that place."

It was arranged via our hotel, and we brought the regular ticket albeit bein g told by people who had been before that it can get quite busy down the bottom.The tickets are a little expensive, however you are getting transport there and back, entrance and alcohol is included. So you can't complain too much! Many peoples reviews on here are a little misleading. I'm sure people think it's a sit down show and disappointed to find they have to dance because its a nightclub and show! :)The shows are anything from Freddie mercury, moulin rouge and so on! Then a dance inbetween.If you're up for a boogie and to see some fantastic fun shows then this will be right up your street. When we were in there we much preferred being standing down below. We could dance and interact with the show, and to be honest the tables look pretty cramped themselves!! They didn't hold back with the vodkas in our drinks either!! They were pretty strong & there's so much tequila! Things to note (because our hotel rep didn't give us this advice!):I wore flip flops, but u might want to wear converse or shoes of some sort if you are worried about your feet getting stepped on.The que to get in is MASSIVE!! so take some dollars/Mexican peso with u to pay for fast track to get in! It's so much quicker! It was 20 dollars each for us.Take your ID just encase.Enjoy!! "

We certainly don't have anything comparable in the UK.From 11:00pm to around 3:30pm, you essentially have a cabaret club night of many mini popular culture themes interspersed with decent and generic popular musicOur 60 USD each (paid at our hotel) got us travel to and from the club, entry and all of our drinks for the night - shots are extra. It was a long queue to get in, once we did, we received drinks and shots along the way - a sign of things to come.The club itself is more of an arena - 3 sides and 3 levels and a ground floor onlooking at a main stage - this is where my only real negative of the night is - we were well positioned facing the stage high up but behind a few people in a major gangway to the toilets and the bar - this was our place for the night - we couldn't always see and regularly had to make space for people and waiters passing by. Coco Bongo isn't a club in the traditional sense - you can dance and everything but for most people, their spot for the night IS where they are all night. My one recommendation without knowing how much it is would be to try and get a table. Other than that, we didn't even need to go to the bar - a waiter passed by with incredible frequency to bring us well remembered drinks all night long.The show had tributes to Michael Jackson, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the films Spider-Man and Tron!! That's just to illustrate how random it all was! It was dancers in full costume, spectacular acrobats and random comedy moments - all just needs to be seen to believed!Amazing night - just needed some a better position and it would be perfect!"

This meant we got to skip the queues and have a place to sit on the first floor. HAving a certain spot was good but it was very cramped. If I moved my legs I was kicking the person below me in the back of the head. I had pictured a table but it was actually just bar stools along a balcony. The build upTo 'the show' is a bit boring- not much going on. But once 'the show' started the night starts to go really quickly. I think saying it is a show is confusing as I was expecting one long performance. What you actually get is lots of mini performances between about 11.30 and 2.30 am. There is really good music on in between and fun stuff happens like balloons are released for everyone to dance with. The gold member section is a bit hard to dance in due to lack of room.If you really want to party and dance I would say to go for regular entry. Overall it was a really good fun night out. Very different to a normal club due to the performances."

We had transportation to and from the resort so we got there around 10:30pm and at 3:30am we hopped on our bus and left.

            "review": "Great idea, but ruined. My girlfriend and I had been looking forward to visiting Coco Bongo for years, so were really looking forward to going. Unfortunately however I need to agree with some of the negative reviews below. The idea is great, as a massive fan of the Mask movie growing up, I was looking forward to seeing what the Coco Bongo was like in real life. The tie in of nightclub and live performances/gymnasts is a great idea. I certainly can't fault the sound system/music or the performers (gymnasts)....unfortunately some of the 'mime' acts e.g. 'Lou Bega' in particular couldn't even mime the correct words. I know it's probably due to language barrier i.e. English is probably the performers second language, but it was massively off-putting and just made it feel tacky. The real issues actually started with the person that sold us the tickets at our resort. We travelled from the Valentin Imperial Maya resort with another couple, and paid for 'VIP' area. The person who sold us the tickets (be careful with these guys), assured us it would be VIP area, away from the crowd, private transfer for only our hotel (it wasn't...they tried to be fly on the way home and take other hotels too) etc etc But really when we got there, the 'VIP' seats were really a tiny round table, crammed together with about 8 others, judging by the available space about 4 too many, 2 stairs up from the general floor. The person who sold us the tickets was at least a bit honest in admitting it's all based on what drink you buy where you get to sit. I was honestly shocked how bad the staff were, and this is the biggest issue and what ruins the club. Our waiter was hysterically bad. He was completely disinterested, and obviously dreamed of being one of the performers, as he constantly just watched the acts, danced along, actually appeared on stage at some points with some of the other waiters, and creepily just inappropriately stared and took pictures of any attractive girl nearby. He brought our bottle over to the table and opened it, then completely ignored us to focus on his above goals. The other staff rudely stormed about, managers ignored anyone that complained about the over-crowding. The only staff I felt bad for were the poor guys that had to sweep up after every confetti bomb. There was barely any room for the 4 of us to sit/stand/breathe never mind these poor guys trying to clean around us. On a slightly positive note as mentioned above, the music was great, gymnasts were great, but it just seemed like every couple of minutes they let off a confetti bomb to distract you from the over-crowding and terrible staff. The treatment of girls was also laughable. Throughout the initial build up, the main screens would show random 'spotlights' of girls. Attractive girls were given 'backstage passes' which allowed them the privilege of potentially appearing on the stage - this involved being told to dance and then an air blast would try to blow their skirt up, if they didn't dance well enough they were pulled offstage. The majority of girls involved were obviously up for it, so fair enough. They would vacantly just dance away, try to take 'selfies' of themselves etc so I suppose you can't really blame the club as they were on board with it, it just felt tacky and laughable to me. So yeah, sadly not good memories. I love clubbing, I love music and I love watching performers, but sadly what is a great idea has been ruined by what appears to be scummy management, over-crowding and terrible staff.Wouldn't actually recommend going unless you can just get wasted and ignore the above, or there is a massive group of you to distract/get a good spot. Also, be careful around the outside area at night, doesn't seem the safest.It doesn't put Vegas nightlife to shame, it really doesn't."

Ever since then we've wondered if it was the same, I finally tried it with a date. We paid 145$ per person to get a bar stool on the second level and unlimited premium drinks. There was no host to liven up the area like last time. My date and I had approximately 5 drinks( kettle one vodka) and soda. We arrived at 10:30 and I have no recollection of anything after the last pic on my cell phone at 1:34 am. My date was lucid enough to get us to the hotel for 25$ which was only 4 blocks away. We spent the next 21 hours sick as dogs not able to function. We 100 % believe that we were either not drinking Kettle one, but a cheap vodka in the kettle one bottle or we had something slipped in our drink. The shows here are great, but we didn't really even get to dance. I will never go again nor will I recommend to anyone else. The playa pub crawl is almost 1/2 the price and much more fun.

We had transportation to and from the club and it went smoothly. Tickets were $65 and $50 on ladies night. The shows were out standing. The place is packed so be prepared. But it is well worth the money and it is open bar once you have your ticket. I would 100% recommend experiencing Coco Bongo at least once."

            "review": "Fun night out! Just be ready for a late one!!. This is my second time to Coco Bongo. First time was in Cancun with a girlfriend and this time in Playa was with my Husband. I had to bring him to this!We stayed at a nearby resort and booked the package with them. We went straight for the Gold Member package. With this we had a table on the second level with continuous drink service. Knowing from my past experience, I knew that I didn't want to be down with the general crowd and fight my way in to the bar. So this was perfect.Our waiter brought us drink after drink after drink... we didn't need to ask. He would actually take my glass away most times with half the drink left and gave me a new one! We left him a nice tip- very attentive.We sat next to some older couples that came from our resort also. They were having a great time up until about 1am and then I think they were ready to go. Another couple left after about 20 minutes... thinking they didn't like it! I would describe this place as a nightclub with bit of Las Vegas style shows. Do not go into this thinking that it is purely a show. There are lots of young drunk kids and loud 'top 40's' music. Of course there is a lot of other stuff, oldies music mixed in... but its primarily geared towards the young. The shows ended at about 3:30am... so just be ready for a very late night.It hurt me to see the older couple leave after after 20 minutes knowing how much money they spent!! So please don't go into this thinking its going to be anything different from what I described!!"

Me and my boyfriend booked this direct through a coco bongo rep at our hotel - I strongly recommend going vip as it is absolutely worth every penny! All drinks included, your own personal waiter who tops up your drink before it's even empty and looks after you the whole night. Great seats, fantastic view, and you even get the chance to go up on stage and dance with the acts! No queuing, no getting squashed! Not sure the experience would've been half as good if we'd have gone non vip. The night goes on until about 4/5 in the morning - didn't think I would make it the whole night but the night is so mesmerising and entertaining that it keeps your engagement until the very last minute! Our waiter Uber was amazing, looked after us so well and made the experience all the more memorable. Even if you don't think this is your cup of tea, You'd be crazy to miss out!"

Definitely worth it as you skip the queuing outside which can be quite long and get a table and seat. Everyone else is stood up downstairs and it is a bit of a mad crush. Our table was great and our waiter bringing us drinks all night was lovely. Try to get a table near the front of the balcony so that you can see everything as the show takes place on the main stage which you are level with as a VIP. Everyone else is below. But there are also bits with people mid air and dancing on the bar which you miss if like us you are near the back of the VIP. The drinks were good and free flowing with VIP. The show elements were really fab with bits from batman, Michael Jackson, phantom of the Opera, spider man, tron, maddona, Elvis... The list goes on! The night is half show half club and is a good laugh. There are some entertaining acts. In between the short acts it reverts to a club which to make the most of in all honesty you need to be a partier and a drinker. We went on a Thursday was full of a younger crowd drinking hard and partying hard. Just be aware if bringing younger teenagers in a family group that there were cameramen filming dancing etc and a lot of the thrust of that was zooming in on women and blowing air up people's skirts. The transport back to the hotel was hell for us as we were on the group coach back to the hotel and were with a particularly lairy loud very drunk group of people. This however I am aware is what you would expect coming from a club night, but just be aware this is essentially what you are booking as we felt we were being sold it by Thomson more as a show. Overall it is a good experience and certainly unique in what you see and you be hard pushed to find its rival certainly in the UK! I went with my husband at the start of August.

Service was excellent.This is the most mad, crazy place I have every been to. It has to be seen to be believed!!!!! The show is set on various levels from acrobats up in the air to dancer on the ground. Balloons and tic a tape flying through the air. Great music, fabulous entertainment well worth a visit for a fun night out. The only problem is the time goes too quickly. CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK AGAIN."

We bought tickets on arrival from one of the reps in bright yellow we asked if he could get us in any quicker as it was after 10:30 and the line was huge!! He told us if we bought from him paying $65 US he could take us through to a quicker line on the left, we did this and were immediately escorted by the rep straight to the front of the line and inside. We were given tequila shots on arrival and thoroughly checked by security.Our tickets were standing only which I have to say I much preferred! We went up to the seated areas and it was very boring and lacking in atmosphere there, on the floor where everyone is dancing is the best! I was given a VIP backstage pass and asked to dance up on the main bar as well super fun!The performance was amazing!! Entertainment that went all night and very skilled performers doing a variety of different acts loved every minute! The down side to standing room Only is you have to get your own drinks, we tipped our waiter and he brought us anything we wanted all night including doubles. (If you're dancing on the bar the staff will also give you anything you want while you're up there :))This has been a huge highlight I definitely recommend to anyone staying in playa to go! It is a big night of dancing and place is very busy so be ready to get cosy with your fellow dancers!"

However, when we arrived we were told by a different employee that the cost had changed and we would be in the VIP section BUT WITH ONLY 3 chairs We asked that he call the person we talked to and he did and the person confirmed the price and package. The conversation was in Spanish and when he hung up he told us that the offer was not valid. We then told him we understood Spanish. After going back and forth, we ended up with seating for everyone but not in VIP SECTION. once we were inside it is a fire trap. Exit signs are not marked. It took us two attempts to go to the bathroom as they pack so many people so that you cannot even move. Not worth the risk"

That includes the coach there and back, free drinks (they said branded but they weren't), queue jump and entry into the VIP area.On arrival at Coco Bongos we had to queue - it seems everyone for the gold member arrives at the same time so we had to queue anyway! You then walk through some long corridors where they give you shots of tequila, a watered down cocktail. We then arrived at a bar, no one seemed to be telling us where to go, all we could see was a huge crowd. A man who worked there then spotted we had goldmember wrist bands on so told us to follow him to the VIP bit, it was so busy we nearly lost each other. We then arrived in 'VIP' - we had 3 tables for 8 of us, it was really cramped, the next party were basically sat on our table too as they had 10 people around 2 tables! The waiter asked us what we wanted to drink straight away and said they only do local brand alcohol (not what Thomsons told us), the drink did come really quick and our waiter was great at bringing you another when we saw your glass was empty!The show started after everyone was in the VIP section, it started off great with some good shows and sketches but by about 1am it was poor, a woman badly miming to Madonna was the final straw and we left around 2pm.Without sounding boring, as I love a good drink and night out clubbing. It really is just a vamped up nightclub and I think it's better to go drunk and just get drunk!"

Watching a dwarf pretend to drop a large tray of full drinks numerous times was not my idea of money well spent. Watching girls skirts get blown up over and over again also not my idea of fun. Drinks service somewhat lacking. Large intervals playing old music to make up for the lack of show and girls dancing on bars and paper confetti shot from canons about 20 times in total. Also watched a shot girl begging a bloke to drink her shot that she was holding up to his mouth, even though he said no she perserveered and he eventually drank it. Seemed very dodgy like she wanted to get him so intoxicated and take advantage. This is what you should be prepared for and if it doesn't sound up your alley don't go you won't regret it.

A few caveats: If you enjoy being swindled by a guy who is not all that good at lying, and if you are prepared to be baited into a deposit then later realize that what you've been promised is not what you'll be getting, then by all means stop reading and go spend your hard earned cash at Coco Bongo. They'll say anything to sell a ticket. During my visit, 1 salesman fully acknowledged that the person we booked with \"calls everything VIP\" even when he is knowingly selling non-VIP areas. \"Bottle service\" and \"VIP\" does not guarantee you a place to sit. With a group of seven, we were initially offered only 4 seats. The seating areas are cramped and there is absolutely no guarantee that someone will not climb over you to leave their seat. Also, if you consider battling your way to the bathroom (or the exit) through an absolute crush of people a \"sport\", then Coco Bongo will suit you well. The place is a First-class fire hazard. Is it worth it? No. The show itself is a schizophrenic mix of theatrical karaoke, cirque du soleil, music videos, and gratuitous shaming of drunk female patrons (if you're looking for spring break, well...) all of this is punctuated by an overuse of confetti canons, and blasts of air from all angles (including up some people's skirts). The confetti, the air, and the exposing of g-stringed bottoms all gets pretty old pretty quickly. Three important elements of the night saved the experience for me: (1) I was with a group of friends and friends can have fun anywhere, right? (2) It was clear that the performers work very hard to deliver the show, and (3) the music was good enough. This is definitely a \"one and done\" kind of place. The management decisions at this place struck me as predatory on the street sales side and irresponsible on the inside. The place sells itself as a disco and show. If you're interested in dancing... Go elsewhere. You may be able to manage a modest hop up and down but they pack people in so tight some people were stuck in the hallway they entered through (not my idea of a good time). With so many options in the area, giving this place a miss would be a no-brainier. Wish I would have read the other reviews before going! "

Me and my partner went twice whilst on holiday, on Thursday 2nd July and Tuesday 9th July. Both times were a really good night but read the following to ensure you get the best possible night.Firstly, don't book with Thomson reps or whatever airline reps are offering. They only offer gold member tickets, roughly $130-$150 a ticket. This option offers a free bar but no que jump and every night is a huge que that you could be in for hours. Me and my partner both times went with the official coco bongo reps (in ocean Maya Royale hotel, Daniel and Ariel, both such lovely guys and deserve to make money as they work all day in the heat and Thomson reps take their business with less knowledge and less options) bought a bottle of vodka which between us was roughly $190. For that bit extra you walk straight to the front of the que, get your own table (gold member tickets you have to stand with no seating available whatsoever) and constant service from staff. The Thursday we went with friends who had also bought bottles of vodka, we were at the top level which was high but you could still see all the show. The Tuesday we were on the middle section with a table, which is probably the best as you can see everything more clearly. It proved that we made the right decision buying a bottle, as upon arrival we went straight in, but people from our same hotel who came on the same night who bought gold member tickets were queuing for almost an hour, who then had to stand for the duration in a part where they couldn't see the all parts of the show properly. Don't go on a Friday or a Saturday if you want some space. Every night is crazy busy but we were told that these nights are even busier. Friday and Saturday is also more expensive. Some people moan about how busy it gets but it's a tourist attraction and the most famous club in Mexico, what do you expect??! It's a good laugh, fun shows and a must see in Mexico, but I advise always get a bottle as the service is much better. The shows are vibrant, fun and entertaining, from dancing to stage fighting, to gymnastics and acrobatics to tribute shows. If you're in Mexico, you defo have to see this!!!"

We could see all the tables down below (assuming they were the gold member seats) but it was hard to tell because it was so packed.The show is absolutely crazy, with lots of tribute acts (some are dated now, such as Queen) but it doesn't really matter as some things are timeless classics and everybody knows the words / songs.There were balloons everywhere, ticker tape, crazy dancers, people hanging from the ceiling, dancing on tables, all sorts!

Firstly as a honeymoon couple we had been told about this club by many friends and told to go but to book vip seats so we did.We booked through our hotel and specifically asked for the vip seated booth so drinks would get brought to us and we could sit down as we were there from 9pm to 3am.So transfers were fine took us to the que were to meet back up and what time but the coco bongo rep who came with us then pointed out we had been given tickets and paid $180 to stand all night but get unlimited drinks. When we tried to argue that we asked for vip he stated its not what we had paid for and all the vip booths have now been taken we also would then have to queue up which would have been for well over an hr we decided to pay the extra $20 to skip the queue with another honeymoon couple we met on the transfer down. We were told to stand on a step when we got in there as we would have a great view of the show at one point i tried to sit down for a few minutes while waiting for the show to start and was made to stand back up it was soooo cramped in there that you were shoulder to shoulder and couldnt move all night trying to get to the toilet was impossible.The show itself was amazing it didnt start while 11pm but it was brilliant and deffinatley worth going to see.We found it difficult to get drinks from the waiters unless u were vip i had to ask 3 times for a bottle of water.The atmosphere is amazing and u need to watch the videos on youtube because it is a fantastic show but just a shame about how cramped you are and the mix up which was the fault of the hotel ultimatley. Hense only 4 stars and not 5... Deffinatley worth going to see once you have had a few drinks it really doesnt matter and its just a great atmosphere down in the thick of the show..."

There are a few different options and prices for coming here, our experience was on a Thursday night, standard ticket which included return transport and open bar tickets, which we booked through Thomas Cook guide in the hotel. $65 each and we waited a max of half an hour in the queue arriving at 10.30pm. Extra gets you a table, waiter service and a decent view of the main stage, and you get to skip the queue. Although we got waiter service on the main floor a few times no problem. Upon entering, you are handed a drink, then further on you get a tequila shot and then you hit the main hall. It was very similar to a movie scene where everyone is crammed into a fighting ring, the majority of the floor has tables dotted around and these are standard, there are tables higher up and better views but that doesn't take away from the atmosphere. My partner and I found a good spot close to the front bar and a view of the stage, there is lots going on all through the night and all ages and creeds make a great party atmosphere. Great dancers/actors keep you hooked and the themes and costumes are top notch, my fave was the Tron theme as I love the movies, but dont want to spoil anything else for anyone :pIf you want a good night and great atmosphere, meeting lots of cool people then this is definitely worth a visit. It didn't feel any less fun on a standard ticket but on busier nights like Fridays and Saturdays, if you don't want the hassle of waiting about it would probably be worth the extra to get a good seat/table. \"Let me hear you scream!!\""

We wasn't getting much hep from the people who went already so we went with no idea of what was it about .  We got the \"vip\" seats which entitles you to a table and all you can drink . But for over three hours in a tight TIGHT space they want you to stand the whole night. If you bought a bottle, then you were entitled to a chair . Which was ridiculous . I believe they poured you up with alcohol just so you wdnt realize the nonsense that they were doing . The show itself was very good. They acted out scenes from movies and incorporated them into the show. They personated different artist while playing some updated jams. All I can say : if you go ! Bring comfortable shoes , expect to bump to everyone and drink lots so you don't realize how uncomfortable you really are . Then you will have fun"

The drinks kept on flowing all night and you had your own waiter. So all you had to do was sit back and enjoy the experience. The aerial acts were fantastic. As for the live tribute acts, they were excellent. My favourite was Michael Jackson, the way he moved and the likeness were uncanny. I'm not a Queen fan but that came a very close runner up to Michael Jackson. To not visit this club would be a crying shame. You will never experience a club like this at home. Would I go again, without a doubt if I get the chance. This is one place that you want to visit in Mexico."

It meant no queuing and your own chair and table on a higher level with table service.As soon as you enter you are given a drink & a shot.Your waiter will bring drinks to you then the whole night. The drinks I would say are watered down as they didn't taste strong at all.The show itself was good but I was disappointed in a way as the acts were miming where I had the opinion it was live acts. Never mind still a good night but think \u00a390 was a lot of money to pay to watch a couple of minutes miming every so often. Our hotel entertainment was very similar so wanted to see something different so was disappointed."

We are both in our 30's and were a bit concerned about the 330am pick up and it being a mad drunken party! Well the time just flew. It was the best show/party, night of entertainment I've ever seen. We had so much fun! We bought the gold member ticket and we were pleased we did. We had amazing seats right opposite the stage and we never had an empty glass. It does get quite crowed in the cheaper ticket area with limited seats! Coco bongo is not to be missed."

We lined up at 10pm and met him there to pay and collect tickets. At 10.30pm they opened the doors and the queue moved fairly quickly. We were closer to the front as we got there earlier. Lots of people behind us! On the way in we had a drink and shot, queued again for bag search etc. VIP ticket holders went in faster but we didn't have to wait there very long, was all fine. Inside we asked where the best spot was. we went to the left of the stage and up to level 2 same level as stage and right opposite it. It was a great position . We could rest our drinks on the small bar infront . Nothing blocking our view. We danced there all night and our waiter Fernando brought us drinks all night long. He was great. We tipped him 300 pesos. If you choose open bar, make sure you arrive early. Some people with open bar tickets had to stand on the stairs or behind others because they got there too late to get a good spot.The main level looked fun but way, way more people. VIP tickets were expensive and we didn't want to be sitting down all night anyway. It is a very mixed crowd of all ages and most people stand and dance. At about 2 am people started to clear out a little and we had even more space. Show was entertaining. We had fun dancing and drinking to all the hits. Acrobatics were impressive. All in all a great night out dancing for us :)"

We had tried to get gold tickets through our rep (First Choice) but only the following week was available which didn't help us as we were only there for a week. But he suggested the bar crawl instead which ended up in Coco Bongo anyway. I wasn't sure as I liked the fact that with the gold tickets you got drinks brought to you - but as it turned out our group was escorted right to this private area where unlimited drinks were brought to you anyway, and the server came back regularly. Probably too regularly given the thick head I had the following morning! The shows were great too, keeping the entertainment pretty much non stop. It's true that the view was a little restricted if you weren't at the front but it didn't really matter seeing a lot of the entertainers are suspended from the ceiling anyway! There's toilets right there in the private area but a little cramped to say the least and a bit of a queue for the ladies, according to my better half. Overall though we loved it and this is definitely a must-see at least once when you visit Playa, for sure."

It was a planned excursion with my hotel so everything was organised for me which was great. It made the whole experience a lot easier and I didn't have to worry about money or arranging transport back to my hotel. It was non-stop entertainment and I was never off the bar, dancing my night away. I enjoyed being in the main \"pit\" however as the night went on, it seemed to get a lot more crowded and there was a lot of pushing and shoving. It was a bit of a mission getting to the bathroom and you had to try and squeeze your way past a lot of people which became very uncomfortable. By the end of the night I was ready to leave since it was becoming unbearably busy and I felt I was getting squashed. That said, it was a fantastic experience and I'm pleased I went and saw what all the fuss was about for myself!"

            "review": "Superb Night!!!. We had heard many good things about Coco Bongo and were told that if you go to Mexico you need to visit the place. So after the first week of our holiday we decided to book the Coco Bongo night through our Virgin rep at the hotel. We opted for the VIP package that cost us 150 USD each. This includes the taxi there and back, express entry into the club, your own table on the first floor with waiter service and drinks all night. The taxi arrived on time and we took the 30 minute drive to playa del carmen. On arrival the taxi driver explained that he would pick us up at the same point at 3am. It was quite confusing on arrival as some of the people in our cab had booked through different operators, so not everybody had the same vouchers. We showed our voucher to one of the Coco Bongo staff and were told shown to the VIP queue, which was alot shorter than the general ticket queue. Once inside we were given some sort of alcohol juice drink which tasted ok. Everybody was searched once inside and things like tablets and selfie sticks had to be given into a cloakroom where you got a ticket to pick them up at the end of the night. You walk past a little stall selling bits and bobs which are highly overpriced but there was no hard sell. After this we were escorted to our table. Ours was situated at the top of the first flight of stairs, elevated behind the row of people who were sitting at more like a balcony bar. Its quite tight in there, especially with the waiters walking through with trays of drinks but they didnt spill a drop from what i saw. Our waiter was excellent, constantly coming over as our drinks got near empty, as with most of our time in Mexico, we could not fault the service here. The main area/dancefloor is quite small with a large square bar in the middle, it got quite crowded down there as the night went on but everybody seemed to be having a good time and we saw no trouble. We arrived at around 10pm which was about an hour before the main show. A countdown timer is shown on the big screens of how long you have until it starts, until then the dj played some good music and we were really in the mood. I wont give too much away about the show but we found it really entertaining. There are different tributes to certain acts and certain shows are replicated with dancers and acrobats. It does get quite frenetic with streamers, confetti, lasers and smoke everywhere but we loved it. The thing we liked most was the fact there was no live singing, so you didnt have a rubbish singer ruining elvis or mj's songs. Only thing we found to be a little annoying was that the toilets were tiny, one toilet for women and 2 urinals for men, which with a club of that size is ridiculous. We had an amazing time though and would definately go again.Things To Remember:When we originally booked we thought we were booking the Coco Bongo in Cancun, which is meant to be alot bigger and better. We just took it for granted this was where we were going, so if you specifically want to go to Cancun make sure to ask when booking.Id say this place is aimed at the younger generation. If you are an older party animal then it will be great for you but if you're looking for a quiet cabaret show this is definately not it.Hope this helps :)"

Everything was going well until we got inside the club and the waiter tried putting us on a table that was in the middle of dancing floor with no chairs. This was my 3rd time at this place and knew how crowded it could get, I made them give us a table somewhere else. Instead of 2, we got one table. The area we were sitting were meant as stairs and not sits. After taking to the waiter several times, the light on the stairs were turned off and people stopped moving us around. The club was fun but too many shows and does not give you a lot of time dancing."

            "review": "Minus 5 Stars - Read this before Going!!!!. Coco Bongo was sold to us as a late night show and dance that was all inclusive. We were told we would have a place when we got there and everyone could sit or stand to watch the show. We paid 130 us dollars to gain entry into the event. For starters, the driver for the bus that picked us up didn't speak a lick of English. When we arrived he dropped us off in a bus station parking lot and held up a sign that said the number 4 and 3:20 am. He didn't tell us where to go or where coco bongo was even at. We figured it out after walking through some sketchy Mexican streets.Once we arrived at the event the line was well over 1.5 - 2 hours long. Some lady from the club said for 20 us dollars they would let us skip the line. We went ahead and did it fearing we wouldn't even get in otherwise or have a place to sit for the show. After we got through security and some bad drinks they served us on entrance we walked into the main room.The main room was unbelievably tiny. It was jammed pack when we arrived and people were already standing side by side. We tried to go up the stairs and they stopped us and said we couldn't. The club tried to scam us by telling us it would cost 80 us dollars to stand up in a hallway on the bottom floor (you wouldn't have even been able to see the main stage from this spot.) Then he wanted 165 us dollars for us to go to the 3rd floor and stand next to a rail for 3 hours. We obviously refused and just stood there knowing the amount of people coming in they would have to give us a spot to stand somewhere as they couldn't all fit on the bottom level. Surely enough after 30 minutes they allowed us to walk to the top level for FREE. The same person who tried to scam us 30 minutes earlier. When we finally got to the top we couldn't even stand next to the rail and had to be on the row behind. We couldn't even see the floor stage from where we were at and people were blocking the view from the girls so they couldn't even enjoy the show.Then comes the show after all the previous mess. We thought surely it would be worth it if this place was this packed. The show was absolutely AWFUL. 75% of the show was the club playing music videos on a projector......keep in mind your spending 65 us per person for this. The other parts of the show were really terrible actors lip singing songs in cheesy outfits. The only good part of the show was that the servers constantly made sure we had drinks. However, I drank 5 long island ice teas in the hour and a half we were there and never got a buzz. The drinks were so watered down it wasn't even funny (long island ice teas are supposed to be pure alcohol for those of you who don't know.) We finally just left after an hour of watching music videos and watching fog machines and confetti be blown around the crowd. It was the biggest fire hazard in the world to have hundreds of people jammed into this tiny little room. I think the only way we could have possibly enjoyed this show is if we were hammered drunk 18 year olds in mexcio. The best part of the night was the mexican food we got on the street after leaving and the taxi ride we paid for to get back to the resort. The resort actually had quality entertainment and good drinks all included so this experience was just a gigantic waste of money. If you really want to go to do Playa Del Carmen night lift just take a taxi to the main street and walk up and down visiting the bars. The bars are way better than this terrible event they call coco bongo......avoid and spend your money on something good like swimming with dolphins or snorkeling."

Share a taxi & Get there 9:45 ish early for best seats with a table and better views otherwise you get stuck like a salmon on the ground floor. Show starts @ 11pm - 2:30am. The people that got there later around 10:20 wernt happy with the Seats but everyone's advised to go early as poss so it's your own fault!! The show was absolutely incredible We did not want it to end. We had the best night out in here. You have got to go see it for yourselves to understand how crazily spectacular it is. The tributes are the best I've ever seen such a good variety & the acrobatics are truly amazing. Everyone was just buzzing about the whole night. Tip your waiter well on arrival to ensure fast rounds that come before you even finish your current drinks. Unlimited bar too.The toilets are non existent 1 male 1 Female cubicle that's all for a very very busy venue. The porter does an amazing job cleaning & prepping before & after each person though but Would be good to have more loos.Perfect night out , you must must go experience it!!!"

What a place!!!I had no idea what to expect, I didn't really know too much about it but people kept telling me how good it was and that I've got to go so my other half and I booked through Freddy who was absolutely first class in booking it for us and also the transport there. He gave us brilliant information, great prices and was great to deal with the whole holiday. He was the rep at our hotel (Grand Sirenis) so we saw him everyday and he was always friendly and had a smile on his face! We left our hotel on a very nice coach to get to coco bongo at around 9:45 with meant we arrived at around 10:30, after a short walk lead by Freddy down the road to coco bongo, we was directed into the VIP queue (as suggested and booked through Freddy) it was a very short queue and we was in the club around 3-4 mins later which was brilliant as the opposite queue looked quite long. We was given wristbands and guided through security, given drinks and shots on the way in and lead to our seat by staff. We was on the first floor not too far from the stage and had an excellent view, we was shortly after greeted by our waiter for the night who was Uber, he was fantastic, very friendly and never let our glasses stay empty and was very helpful all night. The show started about an hour or so of us being in there and wow, what a show, a show cross club venue, like nothing I had ever experience before, the acts were amazing, the dancing was all brilliant and the acrobats also very very good! I was mesmerised all night with the acts, the standard was first class! I have to give a special mention to the Micheal Jackson act, he was awesome! Also really enjoyed batman and the mask too but there are too many to mention, it was all brilliant! The atmosphere was electric all night, the music was always really good and it looked like everyone was having a great time!! The only draw backs I would say from the entire night was the toilets were tiny and usually had queues (especially the women's) and if you are planning to not go VIP, it looked quite busy and the one time we went to find a friend, it took us a while to get through the crowd so I would certainly advise the VIP package which includes free drinks all night and our own seats. We left around 4, got back on the coach which was all organised with no problems and was taken back to the hotel.I would recommend anyone visiting the are to visit coco bongo, such a good night!!! Would be a mistake not to go!!"

We had a private table which overlooked the entire crowd and gave us a great view of the show. We paid about 240$US for the night which in comparisons to a night out in Vegas, was a steal of a deal... We booked it through the guys in the yellow coco bongo shirts that patrol the beach (Omar). Although the entertainment was great, our pickup was at 9:30 pm and pickup from Playa del Carmen was at 3:40 am. It did make for a long night since our bus driver showed up about 15 minutes late and we unfortunately didn't get back to our hotel until almost 4:30am. I do recommend this if you are looking for a fun night out but make sure you take a long nap before heading out, it will be a late night."

I've recently returned home from playa Carmen where I spent two weeks on holidays.Whilst we were there we decided to book through our holiday rep a night at Coco Bongos and we are so glad we did.We paid $120 roughly \u00a390 each which seems expensive but that price was VIP goldmember tickets.This included transport to and from the venue back to your hotel, branded drinks,and an amazing close view of the stage.The theme is heavily music tribute acts such as Beyonce, Elvis, Michael Jackson, lady Gaga, with background activities such as famous film characters being portrayed by actors such as Michael keatons beetle juice, Jim Carey Mask , Batman,Spiderman Etc. The show runs from 10pm and finishes at 03:30 and is jam packed entertainment throughout you will not be disappointed the tribute acts are excellent real high quality performances which will leaving you open mouthed and breathless and wanting more.Make sure you take a camera with you for your own memories not somebody else's on you tube. Coco Bongos has been rated a better live show experience than Las Vegas. Having not been to Vegas I can only say that Bongos is up there for fun packed entertainment at its very best go and check it out people"

I was very worried reading the negative reviews of this place and didnt know what to expect, it turned out to be one of the best nights out ive ever had.We booked through thomson and got the gold vip tickets for the night. These are more expensive than standard but definately worth it. You get seating in the form of either a stool or padded bench seating, a table for your drinks and a waiter that wont let you go thirsty. You are in the balconies that surround the club with a stage below you and another level with the first row of balconies. You are packed in fairly close to other people but we made friends with another couple from a different hotel and had an awesome time together. I was dubious about how mant people they were cramming in to start with but was comfortable all the way through the show. It is quite cramped down on the bottom level near the stage (standard tickets) with standing room only, you would have to fight to the bar or toilet and have to stand all night from about 11 till half 3 when it finishes. The staff were really friendly including security (which there is alot of), the entertainment was spot on with hi wire acts and cameras showing live feeds of the crowd every now and then \"Kiss cam\" \"funny face cam\" etc...Take about 10 one dollar bills each for tips to be one the safe side although we didnt use that many, tupped the waiter every other drink and the same with the bathroom attendant.You can wear flip flops and shorts if you want to although i had light trousers on, not a problem either way as the club is fully airconditioned which is a great feature. Take a camera and enjoy every moment ( ps: jim carrey owns the chain so it has to be mad and fun)"

On our latest trip to Playa, we decided to go to Coco Bongo since it was one of those \"if you don't go to Coco Bongo, it's as though you did not come to Playa\". We looked up videos online and what not so we went. At our resort we spoke with a Coco Bongo representative who sold us the entrance to the club, got us transportation and the unlimited drink package for $65 usd. They told us to meet at the lobby at 10:40pm as the bus would arrive and only be able to wait for 5 minutes. The bus did not get to the resort till 11:15pm. There were two Coco Bongo reps on the bus who were going to explain how it was all going to work. These young guys looked and spoke like they had already started the party 3 hours prior.. they were really drunk. We got to Coco Bongo and had to wait till midnight to get in.Once we got in, we found the place to be extremely small for all the people waiting to get in. About an hour in we could not even move..the drinks were very watered down and the \"special area and private waiter\" we were told we would get never existed. Everyone was on their own. My wife and I took a picture from one of the workers there. The picture was $12 usd for pix and Coco Bongo card stock frame and I gave him a $20. He told us that he will return with change and never did. We looked for him and asked around and no one wanted to give us any information. We gave up on the change. There was constant confetti being thrown from canons and we realized that the confetti that was being shot out was the same one that was being picked up from the floor. A lot of the confetti was landing on drinks and it was the same one being shot from the canons. Just nasty! We were in the bottom and we could not see a single show because there were people constantly dancing on top of the bar and completely blocked the view. We left the place early and waited for the bus to take us back to the resort.... unfortunately our bus never came, we had to wait till past 5:30 am till the Coco Bongo people found a bus for all of us waiting. It was a really bad experience and we will NOT return to this place. Hope no one else has the same experience we did."

Our server was really cool and kept bringing us these innovative drinks. Tip: him 10 and then 10 again sometime during the night and he'll make sure you're well taken care of.

The rep sold it to us as the Cancun destination and not Playa del Carmen, which was inaccurate and blatant mis-selling.We didn't book a table as these were sold out but we had very good views from the higher balconies of the show itself and feel that the tables weren't really worth the extra cost as we had our own separate bar area and toilets, as well as a waiter serving us the whole night anyway. The show itself is definitely spectacular in parts but there's too many spaces between points of action where you're just watching people from the crowd (normally young girls) dancing on the bar. There is a very good atmosphere though and some of the set pieces were fantastic to watch.**People thinking of booking through a Thomas Cook rep**I would sincerely advise against it. As expressed at the beginning of the review, we were initially miss sold the excursion as Cancun. We were picked up from resort at 8pm and told to be back at the bus station for no later than 3.20am or the bus driver would leave without us. In reality, the bus driver did not appear at the bus station until close to 4am and everyone was exhausted and fed up waiting for him. No explanation was given for the delay and no apology was given either.When we first arrived at the bus station in Playa del Carmen another Thomas Cook rep who came to take us to a bar before Coco Bongo didn't even tell us anything,he just marched us along to a bar at the end of the strip and gave us a wristband. The reps who were with us didn't seem at all interested in informing us of what was going to happen and they left at midnight after taking us into Coco Bongo. Their lack of communication was a bit of a dampener on the whole experience and I would really advise anyone planning on booking through your Thomas Cook reps whilst at resort to think again.The tables are only really worth the extra cash if you'd have an issue standing for 3 and a half hours, otherwise they're actually a bit of a con."

I was punched in the face by a very large man. I am a 5 foot 5 woman aged 29 of small build. He was a great deal taller than me and heavy set. He assaulted me because I stepped in a space where his friend had been. My husband was in the toilet at the time and I was only with my female companion. The staff at Coco Bongo did nothing at all, despite the fact that plenty of witnesses saw the unprovoked attack. They allowed the man's group back inside the club and let them to come up to me and laugh in my face! I am disgusted by the way I have been treated. My nose is badly bruised and swollen. I was in the club for less than two hours. When I suggested they could refund my ticket or pay for my taxi home- baring in mind we paid $70 each to get in- they flat out refused. I was informed that the perpetrator would be arrested, but he was outside the building when I got outside, with a smirk on his face. To say I am disgusted with the way I was treated is an understatement. The staff acted as though I was a burden and seemed to view the assault as a trivial matter.Ladies- if you disagree with men assaulting women then please do not go here!"

This was the place I'd been really looking forward to, after hearing such fab things about it before. It was horrendous. My husband and I love to have fun and party, and I love shows, it sounded like great fun! We paid $128 each through Thomson for the 'Gold Package'. We arrived at 10pm as suggested by our rep to be greeted by a hectic, underage and overcrowded mess.We were herded into a small balcony and only brought drinks (which were included within package) if the waiter considered the tip (which he stood there waiting for) enough. The first drinks are made at bar and brought to you, the rest are made in front of you, which sounds acceptable but felt very suspicious. My husband noticed immediately that the drinks being poured to girls were almost neat alcohol with a token amount of mixer. As for the show... Well, the \"show\" actually starts at midnight, not 10pm and then it's about 2 mins of very poor performance followed by about 10 mins of filler. The \"filler\" being staff plying girls with booze and then getting them to dance provocatively on the bar whilst a camera captures down their tops and up their skirts and projects onto a big screen. Some of these girls could have been no older than 14 (I say this because one of the girls I saw was staying at our resort with her parents, so I got to see her the next day!!)My husband and I both felt really uncomfortable and unsafe in there, both with the surroundings and the ongoings. We stayed as long as we could, hoping it would get better, but it really didn't. I did however, leave feeling very nervous for some of the girls in there, both their safety whilst in there and getting home after. In summary, don't waste your money and time on this. Instead, take a walk down 5th avenue and enjoy some cocktails and friendly Mexican atmosphere. I would personally recommend Camillas!"

David served us and he was amazing. We ordered Vodka a coke and when I finish my drink I put it down and the empty glass was almost immediately picked up and replaced with a fresh vodka and coke. I could not fault this kinda of serves, although we did get very drunk. The venue is very crowded but we found the the VIP area was not as bad. This was mainly down to the very good security person who stopped everyone trying to get into the VIP section. The shows were just amazing and I can not put into words how good the night was.

You wont be standing for long though as the music is that good you just have to get up and give in to the music.

Once inside we immediately realized it was WAY too crowded to enjoy ourselves at all. I couldn't get a drink, I couldn't dance, I couldn't move AT ALL. A few drinks spilled on me and my friends, a few elbows to the head & stomach and it was time to go. If only they would stop selling tickets at a certain point, or even open a new location, then many more people would love Coco Bongo the way I used to. I won't return to what used to be an amazing place until I hear they've taken measures to cut down on crowds. Basically it was a $65 shot of tequlia."

You've predrank a little and its nice outside! The wait goes fast! Not knowing what lies ahead makes the anticipation grueling though! Once you get in you go through a small hall where you are given a vodka cranberry to pound back! Follow another 100m by a shot of tequila! Don't worry! This is normal here! We paid I believe $90/person for a bus trip to and from our resort and unlimited drinks all night! And it is a late night! I think it wraps up around 3 3:30! Needless to say we prepared and enjoyed a redbull prior to make sure we could stay up for all the excitement! When you walk into the hall/club itself it is spectacular! It's almost set up as an arena with different levels surrounding the stage in the center! The great part is you can actually be on the stage! You can literally go up in the middle and dance your heart out! It is a lot of fun! There is a lot of security at Coco Bongo and not once did we feel unsafe. It is mostly all tourists here. Maybe the odd local. You will watch a huge variety of shows throughout the evening all while standing around or dancing around... whatever you like! You will be dancing! It is so much fun! If you are likely like I was you will get to go up on the main stage at the top level and dance your heart out! Quite liberating actually haha dancing in front of 1200 plus people can be quite the energy booster! It was literally a night I will never forget for the rest of my life! Ginormous balloons flying around, streamers shooting out! Beetlejuice impersonators to Cirque de soleil type acrobats literally hanging right above your head! it is a show! The Mexicans know how to party! You feel like you are part of this unreal party that is never going to end! I would highly recommend it to anyone within the area of Playa Del Carmen!

We were seated up on high, with a fantastic view of the main stage. The show starts at about 11pm and then is literally non stop until 3am ish - literally one act or performance after the other. Streamers dropping from the ceiling, confetti, balloons - its absolutely insane and thats not even taking into account the quality of the acts which are excellent.The waiter service too is superb - literally never had to once ask for a drink past the initial order. The instant a drink was finished another one arrived. Outstanding.

However i would not go back ever again.I had not been feeling well before we left for the place however when we got there i felt a bit better and was able to relax a bit more.our first problem started with coco bongo spelling my boyfriends surname wrong and so we almost did not get in! Thomson had spelt it right on our ticket so god knows how they got that wrong.seats were not very good for vip and my boyfriend ended up on a shelf behind my seat. we were introduced to a waiter who brought our first drinks over, after this he made the drinks at our table which was a bit weird. i took one sip of my drink 'tequila sunrise' and thought it best just to go slow due to earlier illnes (i had not been drinking alcohol at all that day). an hour and a half into the show i suddenly felt like i needed to be sick so grabbed my boyfriend who tried his best to find the toilets for me. however i couldnt hold and was unfortunetly sick on the floor. the staff were extremely unhelpful, even with my boyfriend screaming at them to help after him asking 3 times nicely. they just spoke into their walkie talkies and turned their backs. we eventually found the toliets and my bf was ushered out of the ladies by a mexican lady for obvious reasons however some fellow british girls looked out for me and took me back to my boyfriend. we then got ushered straight out.bear in mind we had come on a coach and now we were outside with still 4 hours to go...we ended up getting a taxi whos driver was brill as we didnt have enough money for the taxi but waited for my bf to run back to the room for money.thomson have been the only saving grace, they hounded coco bongo and when coco bongo turned round and tried to offer us a free night (on our last night) my boyfriend demanded a refund. we got this in the end only because of adam at thomson desk who we heard very loudly say 'coco bongo cannot keep doing this, happens too many times now' all in all, it seemed like it would have been a good show although they do mime, if it wasn;t for the staff and treatment there that we encountered! it was also very over crowded"

Prices start from about \u00a345 and you can get tickets from your hotel resort rep or from sellers in the town, or at the entrance if you get there early enough. It is a nightclub crossed with a cabaret and you never quite know what to expect, from dancing dwarves to stripping grandfathers! Mime artists perform pop hits and trapeze artists and acrobats fall from the ceiling, while dancers act out scenes from major moves like Batman and Spiderman, flying through the air from stage to stage. There are 3 tiers to the club and you can get VIP tickets with an open bar, or buy tickets only. The cheap drinks are poor and you are crammed in like sardines so you may struggle to get a drink, or see all of the show. It goes on for almost 4 hours and does get a little dull after all that time, but still worth a look. Beware prices, as people were paying as much as \u00a390 a ticket we heard - it aint worth all that. We paid 89 us dollars with a pub crawl and drinks free all night so got our money's worth. Girls can be invited to dance on the main stage and cameras highlight you, so be prepared, especially for the hot air blasts up your skirt! Coco bonkers."

Drinks all included!) Definitely worth paying extra for this as otherwise you'll find yourself standing all night, looking up at the stage.A coach came and picked us up from our hotel and also dropped us off (Included in price of ticket)The atmosphere was electric... It was buzzing as soon as we walked through the door at approx 22:00, until we left which was early hours of the next morning. You honestly won't know where to look next as there's just so much happening!There were singers, dancers, different tribute acts, loud music, gymnasts, lots of glitter and giant balloons... There was even a kiss cam which was just hilarious and all good fun!At Coco Bongo, you will find people of all ages (no children) and we were actually sat next to an elderly couple, who looked like they thoroughly enjoyed the show too.We would definitely go back if we were to go to Mexico again...

Well, a group of us (12, all couples) went there on Friday, May 15, 2015 while we were staying at a near by resort in puerto morelos. All of us bought VIP gold member tickets which were approx. $350 CAD per pair. We arrived there and after a brief delay in the VIP line up we were on our way inside. Security seemed pretty good, they patted up down and they took my Visine eye drops for whatever reason, which I was perfectly okay with. We we offered shots and once the group was all together we were escorted to our area.... this was not good! They brought us to a small area on the right side of the stage that was only big enough for 6 people to sit comfortably... it was actually ridiculous. we were all shocked and in disbelief. we asked coco bongo employees several times to move us and they didn't seem to want to help us at all. Luckily for us, one of our group members was a comedian and a really funny/lively guy, and he was on the big screen going crazy and everyone was loving it (this was about 30 mins before the show started). He managed to get another employees attention and convince him to relocate us and the employee said that because he was\" the life of the party\" he would see what he could do for us.... finally! they moved us over to the left side of the stage on the first level above the floor right next to the bar in the corner. We were satisfied with this new location and had no complaints after that. If we hadn't of been moved I'm certain a lot of us would've left early.Once we got there a girl came around with a whistle and some glow in the dark shots.... she didn't tell us that they were not free and some of the guys done a few, which was fine. she continued to come back throughout the night and ask us to buy more which was slightly annoying but not a big deal.Our server was really good. I gave him $20 as soon as we got there and he made sure my drinks we refilled with little to wait time. I was pleased with this service.The show itself was excellent. Very impressive and very fun. I would've liked to have seen G'N'R or Queen personally, but the acts we did see were awesome. To name a few: Tron, MJ, Elvis, Christina A., Madonna, Batman vs Bane, Spiderman, etc. We danced and enjoyed the music in between performances. It's also worth mentioning that in between performances girls would dance in the center of the stage and air would blow their skirts/dresses up... most people seemed to enjoy that! Haha! Overall it was a pretty great time but when we first arrived we weren't sure that it was going to be a good time at all and I can only imagine how bad it would've been if we had not been lucky enough to be relocated to a much better area. Luckily it was a plesant experience but I can totally understand how there are some negative reviews on here. In my opinion VIP gold member is the only way to do it as it is very crowded at this club. Security seemed to be very good and the bathrooms were very clean.If you've never been to Coco Bongo I would recommend that you check it out... great performances and fun atmosphere."

The show did deliver pretty spectacular entertainment as it was promised but the sad part is how it was so overpacked with so many people that you are constantly bumping on to the crowd and it didn't really leave a space to dance. Good luck getting drinks unless you have a vip reservation, because the service is non existent. Ladies, unless you booked the vip seats DO NOT bring your fancy high heels here because you'll be on your toes for at least four hours!!! Ouch!!!"

The music and show were good but the free drinks were rubbish, we paid for express pass to then be told they dont offer that anymore so my advice would be get there early so as to get a decent spot! If your a smoker- dont bother the smoking area is a tiny spot on the top, you cant even pass each other and the railing isnt safe. Staff work very hard to keep walkways clear and very steep stairs lit up. Im glad i went but wouldnt go again"

The majority of the show is padded out with film clips on a big screen.. With brief intersections of the proper show you pay to see. Saying that it was a good atmosphere. Worth paying for VIP just to skip the enormous q at the entrance. But if you pay VIP you are sat up away from the dancing and action which happens on the floor by the bar. They seated us right next to the screen at first but we asked to move as there was no way we could see from that angle. They moved us without problem which was good. At seat waiter service for VIPs and we tipped the waiter straight off.. He then kept drinks coming all night. If your a bird beware of getting up to dance.. This happens way too often and is used as another form of padding out a pretty light agenda."

And so pleased we did as I would never be able to stand all night long. We had great seats with a table on the 1st floor balcony and had a great view of the stage .. we could see the floor stage too and of course of the artists on the trapeze from the ceiling. Drinks flowed constantly,without even asking most of the time. We tipped about \u00a35 and the waiter was very attentive. The show was immense.. mind blowing, constant and fun. There was miming but who cares. I know I didn't pay to see Madonna or Michael Jackson. I payed to see the show. And we loved every second. The actors and artistes were very talented. There was a photographer and we bought 1 photo but we didn't felt pushed into it. We wanted it for a great souvenir. The toilet was kept very clean by the attendant. All in all we had the very best time.. was amazed we kept going till gone 3 am but the entertainment was so good we didn't have chance to feel tired. I have mobility issues and use crutches and I can't say thankyou enough to the team of staff who ensured I got in and seated safely and when leaving they cleared a path so no one got hurt and we got out easily. We signed some safety paperwork so they were aware of my needs in an emergency which makes me believe that safety was paramount to them. Yes it is crowded but so are most nightclubs. But if you dont like crowds ensure you get in a seat then you would be just fine. Loved it! loved it! loved it!. Can't wait to try out another one on our next holiday."

However, there are special areas where you can stay that are like stages, you can be the dancer of the party.This party is more like a event of several thematic concerts, I've seen Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, themes based on famous people, movies, etc.The price is a bit high it was $60, but open bar, you could drink anything, from Tequilas to special drinks such as La Paloma or Sex on the beach.People there were mostly tourists but I've met some Mexicans coming from another regions in Mexico, as this is a very complex party to make, it might be a unique experience to go only once or twice, as they might have the same concerts every day. But they may change often the attractions.You can also see high skilled acrobats, I felt my self as going to a circus and a theatre not only a party made for tourists."

All drinks and transport were included in the price of the ticket. Firstly our VIP seats were rubbish! Couldnt see a thing and wouldve been better on the floor. Our waiter was fantastic and kept the drinks flowing all night.The show itself was good however nothing in comparison to going to vegas like its marketed! It was a mix of a show and then music leaving everyone to dance which i preferred out of the two.A guy comes round dressed as the mask and we had our picture taken with him. To buy i think it was the equivalent of \u00a315. Spiderman came round later too. Overall this is a good night out and i would recommend paying that little bit more for the gold member purely for queue jumping. We were there from 10pm - 4am and it flew in."

Over all it was a very weird experience. When you walk in, everyone it trying to give you drinks and shots, and for me personally, I like to have a good time but I don't want 3 tequila shots and 2 mixed drinks the second I walk in the door. The show itself was really good, I have no complaints about that. But, in between shows, they would play a few popular songs and they had girls dance up on stage in between 2 HUGE tv screens, and on the tv screens they would project the girls that were dancing on stage. If that isn't weird enough, it's not like it was just a shot of the girls dancing on stage, the camera would scan each girl from top to bottom and zoom in on...certain areas of their bodies.... Those girls didn't seem to mind, but that was just not for me. So I mentioned all those drinks that they throw at you when you walk in? It's not a surprise that one of my friends drank too much and we had to have help from bouncers to get her out of the club since we were on the third floor. The bouncers were incredibly nice and helpful. There aren't even words to describe how helpful they were. It would have taken us an hour to get out of there if it weren't for them."

We opted for the VIP seating from Best Day Vacations at our hotel at the Valentin Imperial Maya. Got picked up and driven to the night club where we had no line up and were immediately shown to our seats on the second floor. No wait for the bathroom and excellent service from out waiter who looked out for the old guy! The varied musical acts were very well done with lots of action and fantastic performances by the impersonators. Before you knew it the clock said 3:30 am and time to get our bus back to the hotel. A great time and highly recommended! Very crowded on the main floor so was glad to pay the extra for the seating on the second floor!"

As it is rated a top attraction and the fact that we travelled with our children ages 18,22,23, we decided to go. We paid 70 US each deciding against the 140 for VIP thank goodness because it turned out to be a waste of money. We were picked up at our hotel, transfer to was fine, and we were all excited that we were finally going to go to this highly rated attraction. When we got there, we were all herded in like cattle and our party was squeezed into an area - well on the steps without any room for movement. Any time we tried to move we were told we had to go back to our spot. I lasted twenty minutes and had to leave as it was too congested. Exits were not clearly marked and I can guarantee that if there was ever a fire , there would be many casualties . Maybe because I'm from Canada where everything is risk managed to death, it made me more nervous , but coco bongo was definitely not what I expected. They describe it like a cirque de sole il, but there was no resemblance to me. It was just a huge overcrowded building. I must say when we left, the employees were very good and tried to encourage us back in by offering us a VIP spot. Well those VIP spots are no different other than they provide you with a small table. They also told us that it wasn't crowded that night- that another 400 people could fit...HA! That's a joke as it was wall to wall people. The staff gave us a couple free shirts and off we went. If we had known what it was going to be like, we would have taken our 420 US and spent the evening checking out the bars and fifth avenue strip. Some people may have fun at this attraction, but it was definitely not for us"

Our waitor was great, i can't fault him at all. The \"shows\" were ok, nothing that amazing. the acrobatics were the best bit! they were amazing. other then that it was just dancers mimming to music. pretty standard really. the atmosphere in the club was really good though so it was worth experiencing it. The only thing i didnt like was that i felt the place was pretty pervy. They used a spot light and spotters to find girls in short skirts who were asked to go and dance like tarts on the stage between acts...as they were dancing a gust of wind blew up their dresses, skirts and tops and revealed all to the audience below. it just felt very seedy and pervy in there. more like a gentlemens club then a club for all. i've seen it, done it..wouldn't go back in a rush. The drinks were all included in the price except for the shots that you get pestered for constantly. They dont leave you alone! they say it is better then Vegas, but i doubt it very much."

We paid for gold member tickets through tomsons so cost roughly \u00a385 each. This meant we got a seat at eye level and free drinks and waiter service. Fair enough, I am glad we done this as its the only reason we stayed as long as we did. They pack the club out to the max. People literally could barely move. It is full of 30+ something Americans acting like 16year old. You spend the whole night having willing girls (I say girls but they were actually women) go up on the podium just so they can 'accidentally' have their skirts blown up to show their thongs. As for the act, it was the biggest let down. You get 10 minutes of show followed by 20mintues of clubbing and so on. The acrobatics where the only good thing about coco bongs but you got around 10mins total of this out of the whole night. All the songs where mimed . They are comparing it to Vegas but not one song was live. Just people dancing around on the stage pretending to sing. Can quite honestly say it was a total waist time and money. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone."

We booked this adventure through our hotel rep - we paid an extra $10 to skip the lines and it was WELL worth the money because the line was a mile long! We went on Cinco de Mayo which is a bigger holiday for Americans than it is in Mexico. There was some confusion over our tickets at first - they wanted to charge us another $20 for VIP, but we had already paid that. I don't think we were actually VIP, we just got to skip the line. We had no idea what to expect but we were greeted with a drink when we walked in, then later a shot of tequilla. Once we got in, we had no clue where to go - we tried going up the stairs but this is where the VIP people get to go so we were told to go back down. The place is NUTS and VERY crowded. Finally a server grabbed us and brought us up to a little section where we stood on a narrow step for the rest of the night. It turned out to be a perfect spot because we were right in front of the stage and off of the floor which was even more crowded. I don't recall our server's name, but we tipped him well at first, then we only saw him a few more times throughout the night. We couldn't have gotten drunk if we wanted to - I think we had 3 or 4 drinks all night which was fine because our flight left in the morning, but may have been disappointing to someone else. The shows and talent were incredible - there is a wide variety of American and Hispanic music, all very fun to dance to! I got hauled up onto the bar to dance which was fun for a few minutes, but I had more fun dancing with my fiance - the girls on the bar are young and don't care if someone is standing there with a camera pointing up their skirts. There were people there of all ages though - one lady got up on the big stage overlooking the crowd - she was probably in her 70's and she was shaking it to \"Pretty Woman.\" The crowd went wild - she was SO GREAT! They are always letting out streamers, confetti, balloons, etc. I do think that they pump the space with oxygen so they keep you feeling cool and awake. As crowded as it was, it was never hot in there which was nice. We left to go back to our bus around 3:15 and we were exhausted! It was a great time - not sure I'd do it again, but well worth the experience!"

We arrived at 9:30pm and the line was more than a NY city block long. We ended up paying the $10 each to get in the club faster without waiting on that line. The worse part of the experience is when you finally enter the door. There were these people that had Gold Member wrist bands and you are stuck in a very cramped hallway with staff member pushing these people past you which causes for alot of commotion and aggravation. So our first hour in there we were pretty annoyed. And once you get inside you have to secure your waiter and promise him a nice tip or else you will have to be going to wait on the long line by the bar to get your drinks."

I have tried to describe this place to others and the best I can do is say it is a dance club meets acrobats, meets broadway show and tribute artists/bands all mixed together to create one massive party with confetti and balloons. What. A. Time. We went with the six of us and were right away greeted by Rodrigo who offered to serve us drinks for the night. He was great, we were never without a drink. Towards the end of the night, someone dressed as \"The Mask\" went around getting pictures taken with groups of people. The cost of these (should you want them) was $20 USD for a framed pic and 12 to have the picture in a folder. We purchased the picture in the folder. Honestly, 12 is really reasonable considering what other areas we visited wanted you to pay for their photos. We paid 70 USD to go on a Friday night (I believe you can go for 65 Sun-Thurs from our resort?). The cost covered our bus transportation (40 minutes from our resort) and our entry fee. Considering what an amazing time Coco Bongo is, it is well worth the money to go and see it. Do not think twice. Just a heads up to all the ladies out there, air blows up from the floor and if you have a very flowy skirt and are on the bar dancing, they will try to expose you. Myself, as well as many others, got caught. So wear a tight skirt or your best undies! :)Have a blast everyone! I will definitely be going back next time!"

Travelling with our two adult children we were looking for a unique, memorable travel experience and Coco Bongo proved to be nothing short of amazing. This tour includes round trip transportation from your resort to Playa del Carmen, entrance fee and unlimited drinks. The club has a very distinct presence on the street and it is easy to become engaged in the energy while waiting for the doors to open. As you proceed inside you are soon greeted a glass of tequila which continues to flow freely all night. The show, that starts about 11 pm and ends before 3 am, is comprised of talented performers are able to entertain and amaze with scenes recreated from movies such as Chicago, Moulon Rouge, Spiderman, Batman, Tron, and Beetlejuice. Further they are able to replicate, with precision, the sounds and stage presence of a multitude musicians including Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Pitbull, Michael Jackson, Elvis, Katy Perry, Beyonc\u00e9, Usher, LMFAO and Guns and Roses to name a few. The choreography, lighting, party atmosphere, acoustics and raw talent make Coco Bongo a truly memorable experience. 2013"

This is a complete lie or staff brought their friends into the area and gave them more prominent views.VIP drinks were supposed to be better than those of a standard ticket yet there were no spirits we could stomach.After every 2 or 3 songs on the stage; general nightclub music was played and local girls were encouraged to go on the podium to attempt to dance provocotively.The acrobatic work was well done but nothing compared to other holiday shows and it was so few and far between it didnt make up for the rest of it being so poor.I would not recommend any Brit going over the age of 21.It was by far the worst part of our holiday in Paradise!"

To get a good seat, I suggest getting there for 10pm and then just load up on booze. The drinks are terrible for those who are picky drinkers. I tried a few drinks before I just stuck to Coors Light for the rest of the night. The tequila girls are hilarious, they will motor boat you and let you motor boat them, but lets be honest, its a tactic to get your money, I could barely taste the alcohol in the shot. I would definitely go again, i would do the gold member again as well, it gives you the chance to go into a less crowded area and then go downstairs into the crowd whenever you want too.

They have you start out walking through a long corridor to get in and there are a few stops where you get some free shots of tequila to warm you up! The line is long but moves quickly because they have to get everyone out to get more patrons in before showtime. They played everything Elvis, MJ, Beyonc\u00e9, songs from movies like 300 and the Mask... All genres of music and they have dancers/aerial artists/harness performances to go with the theme of each song. In between sets they have girls get up on the center bar and dance around but be WEARY... Girls in dresses at the front of the bar (or if you are chosen to go upstairs to go on stage) there's a gust of wind they blow to get the not so flattering 'Marilyn Monroe' effect ;) so either embrace it or don't go to the front heheA great time all in all just not a nightclub for dancing more like an old school nightclub w entertainment like back in the day!

We had heard good and bad things about it, but we wanted to experience it for ourselves. One night as we were walking down quinta avenida we encountered many Coco Bongo promoters, finally we went up to one and asked the price to get in. Thats when he told us that on that day (Wednesday) was ladies night so admission was a bit cheaper than other days. Ladies paid $50usd and men paid $55. Plus he gave us the Express entrance which we didn't have to wait in line, and we got a free shirt. I think general admission was $65. We didn't want to do the VIP admission because we just thought it was too much at $130+ pp. We went back to our resort got ready. We walked over to the COco Bongo and got there at about 10:20, we cut everyone in line and went right in!. walked about 15 steps and we were nicely greeted with a beaded necklace and a mini shot. We walked some more to security, they checked my bag, patted down my husband and walked a little more then another shot. By the time we had actually made it to the main area we had had a couple shots already. ONce there, there was barely anyone there, but as the night went on it got crowded and crowded. Our waiter was named Juan Carlos and he was so attentive to us. He even took us to the mid level on the stairs to get a better view of the show, since the show is up top. I probably would have been a bit more comfortable if I wasn't wearing 4\" platforms standing on stairs for 6 hours. But we had a great time!! Juan Carlos kept the drinks coming all night long. My husband tipped him very well at the end of the night for taking care of us. I knocked off one star for two reasons, one because of the bathroom issue. Even though they were very clean, it was a mission to get to the bathrooms. The second reason was because it was extremely crowded, wished they had a little more control of how many people are allowed inside. The bottom level looked like packed sardines. We were on the stairs so we had a lot more room around us than the people down below. Like I mentioned before when either my husband or I had to use the bathroom we literally had to fight our way down. Overall, we had an awesome experience! I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to go out and have a good time. Would definitely do it all over again!!"

Acts were coming from all directions and kept you wondering what was coming next. We did the gold member experience where you were sat at a table and drinks brought to you before you had even finished the last one. Word of warning, they are very strong! Well worth the money."

Long queues to get in and they search you, then you have to fight your way through the crowd to get to the upper level. The show was fantastic on the main stage and then watching the 'clubbers' dancing on the bar and podium was a 'sight for sore eyes'. Going to the toilet was an experience, only one person at a time was allowed in and then the attendant checked the cubicle when you came out! There were always girls with bottles of drink walking round and trying to sell you shots!"

Staff is rude and they need a good tip to give you drinks or you will wait even more for one. BE AWARE: DON'T GO THERE BY YOURSELF, I went there by myself and got few drinks, after that I remember nothing, I woke up in the street with no belongings NOT EVEN THE BRACELET THEY GAVE ME WHEN GOT INTO THE PLACE. ..So, you can't even prove you were there last night, perfect crime!"

Dancing, drinks, service, ambiance, everything. I don't remember having this much fun in a long time. We danced almost the whole time. After 4.5 hrs which went by fast, we were finally ready to go back to our hotel and retire for the night. Definitely would recommend this to all of my friends. And it's a great show for anyone over 21, no age limit on the high side :). Saw a couple in their 60s enjoying themselves and dancing. Absolutely awesome time. Loved it and would do it again if I am back here any time in the future."

Bought the Gold Member pass which is VIP section through the Sales Rep Hector at Occidental Xcaret. $130 US a pop, which includes all your drinks and transfer to and from the club. (we were suppose to get some t-shirts & beach bags..but that never happened)It's all very fast paced, from the moment you exit your transfer to the walk down the street from the bus depot, it was herding cattle, couples and groups filing down the street to the bar. VIP's have a separate line, which avoids a wait. You are tagged and handed an overly sweet drink in a plastic glass and ushered down a chute through security. Do not bring anything sharp or food like in your purse, not even a headache pill..they will confiscate it! (i actually liked this part-one can never be too safe nowadays!) Once checked you emerge to the centre of the club, there is a central bar that has dancers on it, and the top open and closes all night, during the different routines. We had an elevated section overlooking the main stage. I tipped our server from the get go and once he got organized, the drinks were replaced, sometimes before they were empty! I stuck with straight gin and tonic (tanqueray), can't really mess that up. My partner had tequila, at first they offered him shooters of tequila, but they were not the quality he was used to so he refused them and our server notified him that he would bring premium tequila but it would take 20+ minutes to get..we waited and he kept his promise.(wish I remembered his name) Drinks flowed freely all night.The entertainment was fast paced..sometimes the performances felt like the shifted too fast, you were just feeling a song and the broke into another one, like a remix medley. I loved the balloons bursting out of the ceiling and flowing throughout the vaulted room, at times their was confetti blowing everywhere and sirens ringing to get you hyped. The security level in this place made me feel very comfortable, being in a foreign country you always hesitate to leave your resort with all the horror stories you hear & read. You can feel safe taking a break from your serene environment and shaking it up at Coco Bongo..or if your me..I kept calling it Coco Banga!! Single bathroom in VIP section monitored by a serviette person..never had trouble getting in when I needed to use it. No line ups.Have an open mind, bring some sunglasses for the sites you'd rather not see..(a.k.a the girls with granny panties from the audience dancing on spotlight, only to get a burst of air up their dress!!) Or the sweet little granny they chose to showcase. It's all in good fun.Definitely Recommend~bring another couple..it's nice to share the vibe!"

To get to Coco Bongo we had to deal with some reps in front of the club who think they are Madonna or the owners of the club, one of them kept trying aggressively to seduce one of my girl friends telling her he could get her in for free and put her on stage for the show and that he would meet her on the back of the stage. When she refused he was rude to all of us and made sure his friends at the door where too making us wait for a long time.After we got in of course the place was packed as you can't even walk, it was a pain to get even one drink if an accident where to happen there a lot of people would be injured. We finally set down in a corner to see the show that is basically dancers very badly choreographed lip singing to classic songs. I guess the recorded sheers and applauses and lots and lost of cheap alcohol make the show look better than it actually is. As I read Coco Bongo does not pay any royalties to any of the artists they mimic so basically they are running a big scam and making money out of other peoples talent, shame on you."

We arrived early as instructed by the ticket sales people and we did not wait in line.

I tipped our waiter quite well when he brought our first drinks and he kept us well supplied all night.The show itself was a mixture of tribute type performances including Queen, Michael Jackson and Madonna, to acrobatics on high wires above everyone's heads.

We had a table right in front of the middle bar. No seats. Pretty much everyone in there stands. It was very very packed. The shows were fun and music great. The waiters and waitresses will come by about every 10-15 minutes or so....if you tip them well!! No tippy, no service! We were told this by our guides as well. Shooter girls will also come by with shots, although I wouldn't advise buying them not knowing how much or what kind of alcohol are in them. Just an FYI if you have a severe latex allergy...they drop hundreds of latex balloons for one of the acts. They do clean them up very quick, but they are balloons and can be deadly for a latex allergic person. We had a great time but probably would not return unless I was bringing someone who hasn't been before. Very pricey but fun."

We chose a premium bottle too for our table.The queues are long before the show starts so we arrived a goof half hour early. We avoided the main queue which due to the disorganisation at the door would have taken people over an hour to get in at least and joined the 'VIP queue'. It was the most painful entrance to a club ever, 3 separate queues in an underground tunnel where who pushes hardest gets to the front. If you suffered from claustrophobhia you would have had an attack, it was horrendous. 30 mins later we made it to the front and were taken to a tiny table. A group of 4 had been crammed around a table for 2 twice in our box seat. So we had 10+ people in an area that should have held circa 6.We were given our bottle after another long wait (show had well and truely started) and 5 soft drinks. When we ran out, we were advised to pay for further drinks! After paying $300 we chose not too but were obviously scammed on the VIP all in ticket as there apeared to be about 4 different levels of VIP colour banding. (the offical brouchure shows 1). The manager didnt appear but used the poor waiter to hide behind and give us some 'glass' of soda as a comp. The entertainment was good but not a patch on a vegas show and I'd urge fellow goers to be wary of this money obsessed/less is more venue that could be a health and safety mare!"

It's definitely worth paying the extra for VIP so you get a seat and your own waiter for the night - the downstairs looked like a bum fight! Also give your waiter a decent tip either at the start or the end of the night, they really look after you. Overall, one of the most memorable nights of all time!"

They expected them to pay again even though they knew they had already paid. It took a lot of convincing to let them in but then they were expected to produce their tickets when we got back to the resort at the end of the night, or pay the fee."

Unfortunately the following day one of our party was taken ill and we were unable to attend the trip. We were shocked to discover that even though a doctor had visited our ill party member and provided medical certification that Coco Bongo refused to refund our money! I am utterly disgusted with the service we received, the IGNORED all emails and correspondence sent by the management at the hotel (who were attempting to get our money back on our behalf) 4 x days of waiting for a reply and STILL no response!

Our waiter/barman was very attentive and I personally could not have drunk much more. He kept us plied with our drinks of choice along with the occasional shot of something that I have no idea what it was but tasted good. We were on bar stools at a bench on the first floor, great view although could have been more comfortable. The other benefit of VIP is that you have a toilet within the area rather than having to get through the masses to the main toilet in the basement area. Both toilets were kept spotless with staff cleaning them all evening.The show itself is difficult to describe being a mixture of cabaret. pantomime, concert and nightclub. The lighting and effects are pretty awesome.Overall even if you do not generally do nightlife this is one night not to be missed."

Drink is free flowing and included in the price. I wouldn't advise you go if you freak out in confined places as it's rammed and also you need to be able bodied, the stairs to the VIP area is steep & a struggle to get up & down as there are so many people.

            "review": "Originally misleading, but a great night in the end. . My group of 6 bought tickets from our Air Canada rep for $70 USD. He claimed we were getting the exact same service that the Coco Bongo reps would give us. We were told free drinks on the bus ride there and VIP service in the club. The bus driver provided corona beers...for a $3 USD fee...and did not even drop us off at the club. He took us to a bus terminal nearby and we had to walk the rest of the way and find the entrance ourselves. When we arrived, we saw 2 lines. The shorter one was for VIP line bypass...we stood in that line but were told we did not have the right ticket. We asked the Coco Bongo staff and were told that for an extra $10 USD, we could bypass the longer line. We all felt like this woman was making it seem like our entrance to the club may occur in a couple of hours, not by the 11:30 show start time that we had purchased the ticket for. We were then told of an additional $33 USD pp for a table, and she made it seem like we would not be able to see anything otherwise. We chose to wait in the longer line and we got in after about 30 minutes and saw the entire show. We also had decent seats in the end with good service. One of our group members had an issue in the restroom. Someone tried to open the door on him, and when he closed it shut, and finished, he was met by security and was accused of doing drugs inside the stall. Security patted him down, searched his person and searched the trash before they let him go. Despite these poor experiences, we all really enjoyed the show. We recommend buying the tickets directly from the Coco Bongo staff. Do not bother with your travel rep."

If you can get up on a balcony you can get a good view and down on the bottom floor some people will be able to see the stage but not everyone. The place is packed full of people so getting to the bar could take a while if you were looking to get drunk. With the gold ticket we were escorted to a seat where we were right next to the stage where we had a perfect view and a member of staff kept going to get our drinks and ensured we never had an empty glass. We were drinking premium drinks all night long and there is no restriction on how many you can have. We weren't out to get drunk so we weren't necking our drinks but had about 15 drinks each so we definitely drank the moneys worth we paid extra for and we didn't have to get up once! The show was brilliant and so much fun. Carnage springs to mind when it is in full swing. Lots to watch and fun to sing along to. Get me back to another night out at Coco Bongo!"

Told to meet shuttle at same spot at 3:30 am. Get to show and the line is about a mile long! Get in building still in a cramped line of people and go through a tight hallway. Like being in a cave. The whole time it was wall to wall people. Serious fire hazard! Didn't get a seat or table. Show was a joke. If you are going to lip sync then know the words! Some of the acrobatics were ok. Couldn't handle the pushing and shoving until 3:30 so we left at 1. Didn't really feel safe. Maybe their other venues have better accommodations. No shuttle because we left early. Cab ride price outrageous. It was an over priced bad adventure, but we'll look back on it and have a laugh."

First of all I have to start by saying that Alejandro who sales the tickets are one of the nicest in Playa del carmen We stayed at one of the hotels were Alejandro sold tickets on the beach. I think our biggest mistake was to go here on New years eve :(We paid 7500 Me pesos for VIP tickets for 2 people. And it was NOT worth the money. We got a small table with 2 seats were you barley could sitt (and I am not a fat person). It was so crowded and we couldn't move because people were standing so close to us so it was impossible to move or go to the bathroom. And when I pay for VIP I want VIP :( .The drinks are ok but on a place like this I want really good drinks even though the are included. And on the VIP I dont think that the girls should go around with a wisselpipe try to sell shot. Anoying The show is good , but they stop the show for playing music for 20 minutes and then the show starts again. So , if you go another day then NYE and dont pay 7500 pesos for the VIP as I did then you probably will get a nice experiense"

We bought gold member tickets from our Thomson rep at the hotel for $145 each which included transport there and back, entrance, seats in VIP section, all drinks served with waiter service. It's pricey but by the end of the night we didn't feel short changed at all!I visited the one in a Cancun with my Husband about 6 years ago and remember having a fantastic night, despite my husband not really liking nightclubs ... he loved every minute. I couldn't remember quite how amazing it was, but this club in Playa certainly did not disappoint! I think it is smaller than the one in Cancun but the atmosphere is fantastic. From the start of the show (about 11:30) it was none stop entertainment until around 3am. We had been worried about staying up so late as we had been going to bed quite early on holiday, but we needn't have as time seemed to fly right past. We were seated on the second tier, under the stairs and just behind the camera man. At first we felt a little out of the way, but we had a great view of the show and basically had our own little dance area, right at the side of the bar and the waiter 'Williams' really looked after us and made sure we had plenty to drink. We had been warned before hand about the ladies selling tequila shots and not to take drinks from them as they try and rip you off so we just said no thanks each time they came around. We enjoyed premium brand drinks so I do feel we had value for money. As they advertise, you would pay a lot more for a show in Vegas! The toilets were quite easy to get to from where we were and rarely had to queue. The ladies working in there were really friendly and of course they are after a tip, but I have no problem in tipping good, pleasant service whatever that may be so did give a little at the end of the night.Not everyone stays right to the end so around 2:30 we were taken out from our little hideaway under the stairs and onto a side platform where other people had left and we did feel a bit more included in the party! I really can't fault this place, from the little blasts of confetti, long balloons and at one point we went and danced around the edge of the stage/bar which added to the experience. A fantastic night, one to be remembered. I would not hesitate in recommending a visit, even if clubs are not really your scene, it's like something you have never experienced before!"

They are very clear that if you aren't there within 10 minutes of the allotted tie to leave to go back then they go without you. Which was fine for us, but if you are drunk it could be something thats a problem. Drinks flow all inclusive all night, however shot girls will come round trying to sell you tequila and its not the nice stuff and costs a couple of dollars... 40 pesos. I wouldn't bother. As they bring round nicer shots for free. Also if you are a woman, they will take you onto the stage and when you are up there they may try and make you dance on the podium at the front.

            "review": "Group of 10. We all wanted to visit here before we left the UK for Mexico. We booked through the Coco Bongo staff who came to our hotel. He was very helpful and a great guy. We booked the reserved seats on an all inclusive ticket, which gave the 10 of us 3 bottles of spirit plus mixers etc. The bar was free up to 2am for us as well. My first impression of the club when entering was that it was small. Our area was 2 small tables with table cloths on with stepped seating behind. We all managed to get into our area. We paid $121 each for the seats and all inclusive plus our coach travel there and back.We had a great night, the place is amazing and so glad we went to experience it, some of our party ended up on stage with the acts. It is definitely worth a visit if you are staying near here. We all had a good night. The only bad thing that happened was towards the end of the night, were one of the waitresses who walk around trying to get you to buy shots, ripped one of our group off, she wouldn't give change for $20 the shot was $5 so things got a little heated and kicked off. Once they have you in the place they want to get you drunk, shots on the way in etc, then they can try and exploit you into buying shots at inflated prices. 3 of our group were not drinking alcohol. Watch the ladies toilets too, they have girls there, cleaning the toilet before you go in and giving you a towel on the way out, they are looking for a tip. Having said this, would I go again, damn right I would, it was great!!"

Pick up from our hotel was 09.15 pm, and when we got there and our driver stated he will be back at 03.30 am to pick us up, we started to worry how are we going to cope all night, so we have prepared ourselfs to spend $40 on a cab back...Guess what! We were still singing and dancing at 3AM! The place is fabulous! Nothing seedy, nothing bad! If you like theatre, shows and musicals, then you will love this place. We went in a week and it was busy, so wouldnt go at the weekend!Make sure you get the VIP tickets they cost extra but well worth it. You get your own table on the first floor, pwn waiter, best view (the stage is really high up). This palce is crazy in a really good way. Best night out in our lives ever. We would go back. So dont be put off by the time and look...remember, live shows throughout! You will love it."

The reserved seats are super small but at least you have room to breath, they cram you in there like sardines you can't even dance or move. The servers are very good and manage to get around and replenish your drinks in a very timely manner! I hear the one in cancun is bigger and better so if you are going to go I would suggest that one. Nonetheless, it is a very fun and unique experience, worth the free drinks, and they make you feel like you are in the show because it's so small everyone has a front row seat!"

When booking this exceptional attraction DO NOT use your travel agent/travel provider (Thomsons First Choice etc) they only take your cash Book direct at your hotel with the Coco Bongo agent on site. The price is the same but the level of service is vastly different. The Coco Bongo agent is reliant upon your recommendation and as such delivers a miles better service, the travel company only want your cash and can't be bothered once the transaction is completed. Think about it who will care the most. That said the entertainment is exceptionalTOP TIP book when the agent offers a deal usually on a Sunday for Monday/Tuesday $60 instead of $125 eachEnjoy"

Negatives are that they cram too many people in so there is no space to breathe , also for the price you have to pay you get crappy uncomfortable bar stools to sit on which isn't fair,sort it out management. Drinks are included in the ticket price but you still get harassed to buy shots which is stupid. Overall a good experience not to be repeated"

Advertisement said we were going to Cancun but we ended up in Playa del Carmen? we paid $145 dollars each for a Goldmember ticket which gets you a reserved seat on the balcony queue jump to get in and a constant supply of drinks all night which was great. However it's advertised as a show and nightclub, I would say that more than anything it's a nightclub which for the Goldmember or VIP experience is way overpriced and for the standard ticket it's way to cramped. We got picked up at our hotel 9.30 and dropped off at 5 am so long night!The entertainers themselves are amazing at the acrobatics and the dancing, even the bar staff get involved with the dancing and entertaining which is fantastic. BUT the let down to which I'm leaving this review for is that the 'shows' are not exactly that, they're basically 30 second tributes to bands with VERY bad miming. The curtain opens, everyone walks on singing a chorus and the curtains close....not that great. They do get the public involved with the dancing up on stage, although they don't always pick the most attractive to send up on stage on the big screens for all to see so not such a pleasant view. If I was to go again and that is a BIG if I would most likely go as a big group to VIP or goldmember as the staff there can not do enough for you however it is overpriced. That being said although my experience was not that great, it was advertised to myself as both a show and a club but it is really just a club and likely a great night if that's what you expect although I would suggest ladies wear trousers or risk having their bits on the big screen."

We paid twice as much for this experience as we were told it was a show, it is basically a club with 1 song tributes every 15 mins to half hour. If you want to go out and get blind drunk and be crammed up against the rest of the Playa del Carmen population then its definitely for you. If you are looking for a show I'd give it a miss. This was mainly a rave.We tried to speak to the reps etc for Coco Bongo and fight to pay regular price for our tickets (as they had been charged to our hotel rooms) they were quite simply NOT INTERESTED.They had our money and the service could not have been worse."

Maybe if you are looking for techno or used to \"afterparties\" till sunrise you might find this quite comercial. TIP: We had a transfer from the hotel as we bought our bracelet there but we decided to go earlier,to have a walk around the stores. so we caught a \"carretera(? not sure if it is written this way, it is a little van)\" right in front of our hotel (Bahia Principe) if you ask at your reception they will tell you. And that was the BEST thing we did as we arrived ealier then all the groups from all the hotels. The line gets crazy long, I heard people from my hotel saying they standed for almost 1:30 hours trying to get in. I was in as soon as it opened! Also, if you really are going for the drinks, you better be a cute girl, if you look cute the bartenders will ask you if you want to drink something, if you are a man, you must give them tips, or they wont bring your drinks, the place is crazy full, and if you wont tip them, someone else will. or just ask your girlfriends to get you drinks."

We paid only for standard tickets (VIP gets you a seat) and got the best view from standing up a balcony or two. The bar staff are amazing - remembering what every one is drinking and bringing a constant supply of your drinks to you. Tickets for women are cheaper on Wednesdays when it is ladies night. Its not the best night out if you are sensitive about chauvinism - kiss cams and booty cams abound. However I would highly recommend this show to anyone. Words just cant do it justice."

He explained about this huge long line everyone waits in, to get inside and wait in line, to get into the actual party and be shoulder to shoulder with people, standing the entire night dancing my face off and drinking from the open bar. Or, you could get VIP bottle service, skip the lines, get a bottle of the liquor of your choice, special treatment as you are whisked through to your private table and seats in the action up from the floor. Reserved. For you all night. Where you can keep your drinks, and your private server handles your bottle when you want to leave your table. Then you get mix of your choice, and the party begins! The shows are spectacular and extremely impressive. We had the best party time of our life, hands down. Jim Carrey, you have done a great job orchestrating these fine pieces of entertainment!

We had a superb view of the stage and the centre area where all the live acts performed including several where they are either on trapezes or ropes suspended from the ceiling. The atmosphere is buzzing, a carnival mad mix of music and mayhem. We had seen mixed reviews before going and decided we simply had to go to see what all the fuss was about for ourselves - soooooooooooo glad we did! it didn't appeal to us to be on show floor area which are the cheapest tickets but if you like being absolutely in the thick of it then maybe it's for you, be prepared to be shoulder to shoulder with the masses if you do. We offered our waiter a tip when he got our first drinks (which we had seen people suggest in other reviews to secure flowing drinks) but he refused, said if at the end of the evening you are happy with my service then tip me then - we did as we were !!!!! Just a point - there seems to be quite a difference in ticket prices - recommend shop around the sellers to get the best bargain!!"

We were on the main floor, not in the seating area, and it was crazy awesome fun! It is actually almost hard to describe, but I do recommend exiting when the show is over. That is when the resorts pick up their guests, and there is a dynamic shift in the crowd inside. As a female, I do recommend going in a group, or with at least one male and leaving after the show."

However, they try to cram way too many people in a space that is not built for it. Even if you fork over even more money for premium seats or reserved sections, it is still way too crowded. However, there wasn't a line at the bathrooms - oddly enough.What was good was the entertainment. Very interesting and exciting. However, it was very hard to enjoy when you were crammed in tighter than sardines where your elbow was in the gut of the person next to you (and vise versa).Although many places dub this place as better than Vegas, etc...I would suggest going to a local club on the same strip where you can actually breathe. Although you will likely pay for your drinks at these other places (as drinks are included at Coco Bongo), the money you spend will likely be less than the admission price to Coco Bongo itself. This place might be fun if you are into the MTV style Spring Break or if you enjoy tasting the perspiration of the 10 people crammed next to you, but personally, if I go to a club, I would rather dance, move, breathe, and not be afraid of moving one inch to lose my place in the building."

We bought the basic ticket from the activity desk at our hotel but decided to upgrade based on recommendations from others who had already been. It was definitely the right choice. We upgraded through the Coco Bongo guys who were at our hotel every day. The bus picked us up and our guy Arturo went with us to the club, took us to get our VIP bracelets and found us our seats! He told us be prepared to drink a lot and have a blast. He was right. It was CRAZY fun! The show was amazing! We sang we danced and yes we did drink a lot!!! Our waiter was bringing us drinks and shooters non stop! The whole night passes by way to fast! Would go again in a heartbeat!"

I first experienced Coco Bongo about 6 years ago when we were in Cancun and thought that the Playa del Carmen location wouldn't compare, but I must say it was just as good. Do be prepared to be a bit jostled by the crowd as they definitely pack everyone in - I believe that you can pay extra to get a table on the upper levels though but you likely won't have as good an experience as you do on the main level. Be sure to get a spot where you can see the bar in the center and the elevated stage at the front - when the show starts it is a non-stop display of impersonators, aerialists, and action. The drinks are all included - however beware of the shooter girls as they will charge you extra for their \"showy\" presentation of the shots (which basically involves them groping you while blowing a whistle in your face). Definitely not pleasant and they will charge you each time - I believe it is $5 USD for a measly little shot so definitely avoid the shooter girls. If you tip your server a bit throughout the evening though the service is next to none and they will make sure to keep the drinks coming all night. The staff there is phenomenal. I was travelling with a large group of friends/family and one of my aunts was in a wheelchair that night as her hip was bothering her. They made sure to get her a table with a great location (they had to take her through the back as the Front doesn't have wheelchair access but they were more than accommodating). Then our server made sure that no one stood in front of her table or crowded her so that she could see the show from where she was seated. Such a nice (an unexpected) gesture.We were there until 3:30am and the party was still going strong - we definitely would have stayed longer if it weren't for our shuttle bus departing. Like I said though you have to enjoy the night life as the show doesn't even start until 11:00pm - I would definitely recommend a late afternoon nap before heading to Coco Bongo. This will definitely be a \"must-do\" though every time I return to Mexico."

Only then was he apologetic and rushed to get us some more.A coupe near us left early which meant we could all breathe on the seats. so Coco Bongo's sold the table of 2 to a hen party of 8 who were all stood in front of us. someone from the benches we were on complained and some of them were forced onto the dancefloor.People that hadn't paid for the seats and tables were constantly trying to sit where we had paid this extortianate premium and the staff did nothing until we complained. where we were, we didn't get to see much of the show because of peopel walking along the platform and ruining the view, photographers constantly asking if we wanted our picture (must have been asked 15 times) and women selling shots.It was rammed. were looking for fore exits and couldn't see any.All in all i would not go back. Only on speaking to other people did we find out that VIP should have been upstairs not downstairs crammed in with a limited view so we were conned by the Coco Bongo's hotel staff. and paid \u00a3170 between us for the 3rd rate treatment and 5th rate seats.Thanks a bunch!!!"

We always opts for the VIP/Gold tickets as it provides you with a stool, a waiter, premium liquor and private restrooms. There are only 120 seats in VIP, which is nothing compared to the 1000+ people on the first floor each night. The show is amazing and is too much to put into words. For a glimpse of what you can expect, check out the videos on YouTube. Our waiter this time was Fernando, and he was absolutely amazing. I never had an empty glass and he was beyond friendly. The shot girls tend to get on my nerves, however Yessica was cool and even convinced me to buy a few shots (by promising to only bother me if I raised my hand) lol. Overall this was a great experience, however I did have a HUGE issue with the staff at the front door. I had purchased my tickets 3 months prior to our visit, knowing that it would likely be sold out. On the night of our visit I did not have access to my email as my phone had been stolen the night before. Since I had my drivers license and passport, I assumed there would be no issue claiming my tickets. I made the reservations under my name, so there should be no issue, right? WRONG. The staff at the door told me I could not get in without the \"code\" from my confirmation email. I explained that my phone/wallet had been stolen and I only had access to my drivers license and passport to confirm my identity and purchase. The two girls working the door were INCREDIBLY rude and unprofessional and almost ruined the entire experience. Eventually, after approximately 35 minutes, they decided that my photo IDs were sufficient and I was allowed to enter. I find this unacceptable. CoCo Bongo has a sophisticated reservation system that should easily allow confirmation of a reservation with just your name. While I did not have my confirmation, the girls at the door did not have my name or paperwork in their stack, which they should have had. The entry process was poorly organized and due to the rude treatment by the staff I am not sure that I will ever return. My next visit to CoCo Bongo will likely be when they open in Rio in 2016...perhaps that experience will be better than this one."

Unfortunately, and what I give a strike against, is you'll need to pay $5 US for ONLY 500 ml of water (which is a MUST for anyone intent on going the limit - it's not like you can duck out to the bathroom to get some water of your own). After you get your bottle - sit back and enjoy the show - or get up & dance! Seems that all manner of partying was excepted here. The acts: imitating a whole spectrum of famous singers & their songs, are entertaining and the change-ups are fast. Every so often, streamers of colored paper or countless balloons are released on a cheering crowd, then just as quickly swept away by numerous unobtrusive young people, making way for the next onslaught. The waiting staff is always nearby, clearing your drink of any wet paper or to refill it for you - including ice! The roughest part (for me) is that it goes from 11 p.m. till 3 a.m. But, since it's all fairly loud and non-stop, you don't even notice you're tired - until you get on the bus to go back to your hotel. Here, like everyplace else we visited in the Cancun area (including the airport), the people were SO pleasant and accommodating, it truly makes you wonder why it can't be like this everywhere in the world!"

It's a whole lot of fun in couples or groups.You get picked up from your hotel at 10pm or you can make your own way there.We got general admission ($60-$75 USD) and paid $10 per head extra to skip the que and go straight in. They greet you with alcohol and the drinks keep coming all night.The show starts at 11pm so if you can get up onto the first floor and grab a good spot by the stage you'll have the best vantage point all night.The show is non stop from beetle juice,Chicago, elvis, madonna, Michael Jackson, beyonce,tron and many many more it will keep you laughing, jumping, dancing and singing right till close at 3.20am.Look up to the ceiling because the show is not only on the stage.They get the whole crowd involved with balloons, ticket tape, bubbles and more.Once it's all done I highly recommend a taco or burrito right across the road.. Trust me you'll need it!"

I HIGHLY recommend this to any adult out there.We bought the Gold membership and it was soooo worth it! Even at twice the cost of the floor tickets. You'll easily drink more then your cost. We had our own waiter who would mix your drinks right in front of you. Plus a couple of stools which we used at the beginning, but once the show got going we were on our feet dancing all nightlong. But it was nice to have them.All in all one of the most fun nights I've spent in Playa!"

They have the show on stage over your head, they have dancers on the bar and bring up the patrons to dance too, they have Spider-man and other characters flying through the air! The place is packed but it is not hot. They blow gushes of cool air every so often and it keeps the club very comfortable! This place is definitely a \"must see\"! We have been there twice already and if I go back I would definitely go again! Guaranteed a night of fun no matter how old you are!"

It is very much a nightclub with some shows thrown in, as opposed to a show. There are a couple of acts, then an interlude, where ladies are invited to dance on the bar and it is generally a massive party/carnival atmosphere.Is it a bit cabaret? Well, maybe, but that didnt detract ANYTHING from it.Is it cramped and difficult to move around? Well, we bought \"gold\" tickets, which put us up on the balcony, we had a seat all evening, and we got to the bathroom with absolutely no difficulty all evening. At one point there was a queue of 2 people, but I can live with that.Our waiter/server was brilliant, I dont think I was without a drink all evening, with a new one magically appearing sometimes without me even noticing! Very impressed!I absolutely LOVED this evening, and, while it was a very late finish, it was a brilliant experience its how every night club SHOULD be!"

The environment is great - all ages seemed to be having an incredible time . All type of music was played . We went on a Friday night and it was packed . That didn't matter to us - we kept dancing .

We paid for VIP and therefore were sat on 2nd floor and had an open bar, the waiter keeps you topped up so you don't have to move and actually go to the bar! Very attentive .... even when I changed my drink 3 times since I was trying the cocktails and they were great at recommending options, and even changed one immediately that I did not like too much.The show was great, although we had seen the show in Cancun 2 years ago, we were told the venues were similar but to be hones they are not, the Cancun CB is MUCH bigger, but the Playa Del Carmen one ensures there is not a bad seat in the house since you are close to the stage no matter your seat.Good bater and entertainment and would highly recommend!"

This place truly was so much fun, We are early 40s and a bit worried it might be a bit \"young\" for us I said to my husband we wouldn't last all night, but we did and it was amazing. My advice would be to go VIP as its packed! We made our own way to the venue via taxi as we didnt want to hang around for the Hotel bus. It is a late night (doesnt open till 2200) so get some sleep before hand if you can. For 2 tickets it was approx \u00a3150 - Gold members, that includes all your drinks and VIP queing to get in. You have your own table and waiter service. Drinks were fast flowing!! Once the show started we were in awe, it wasnt like anything I have ever seen before. The staff were amazing, and friendly, a little tip doesnt go a miss and you will be treated really well! Go have fun you really will have a blast! Top tip DO NOT go the night before you are travelling home like we did!! That 10 hour flight was hard work with the hangover from hell!!!"

The shows we excellent and from start to finish the night was flawless no trouble or people hassling us just good fun and jaw dropping performances for the dancers. For any body visiting riveria maya it is a real must.  It was that good we returned again and even received a discount and upgrade to the third level. But to be honest the second level was better it was closer to the stage and when they drop the blooms etc the land on top of you. "

Full kudos to the staff!That being said we did not have a good time (therefore left very early) as we were the wrong market for this attraction and we foolishly believed the hype. The posters at the resorts, on the streets and in the brochures advertise 40 Las Vegas style shows, which, unfortunately we actually expected. The BD Tours people at the hotel were adamant that we would have a great time as it was \u2018the best party in town\u2019 (that should have been a clue). The Las Vegas style shows are intermittent throughout the four plus hours of music, and hardly the focus of the evening, as we had expected.The experience will be fantastic for people who like to start their party at 11PM and go through to the wee hours of the morning with non-stop, heart-thumping, brain-bashing, over-the-top-loud, latest-of-the-latest modern dance music. If this sounds like you, pay the cost for a Gold Pass ($125/pp) to avoid the long, long line up and have fun. The entry fee includes an open bar with the exception of energy drinks (e.g.: Red Bull and others), champagne, and tequila shots. Tequila shots are sold for $5/each, straight from the bottle by women wandering through the crowd. On the other hand, servers brought us un-ordered shots of something that we simply gave back to them untouched. The servers seemed personally insulted when we refused their gifts, but c\u2019est la vie.The other aspect that was somewhat bothersome was the sheer volume of participants. It was difficult to move through the crowd at any level due to the number of people in the place. We were not confident that the Fire Marshall would have approved."

I loved the show, my mum & I went on the ladies night as it was a right bargain price, you get your drinks included however you can never get to the bar and back as its so packed so not even any point paying for drinks when you are at the first floor... It was so packed we ended getting split up and my mum was actually elbowed in the face by one of the staff members as she wouldn't move because she was trying to find me and it was just too overcrowded to get anywhere!! I would say it's really not a nice experience if you are not in your 20s and don't care about being knocked about, just pay extra and go VIP so you can have your own table, the show is well worth it just it's absolute hell down by the stage, wouldn't ever do that again, I rate Coco Bongos, but pay the extra for VIP!!!"

Show was amazing a mixture of cabaret,disco and circus with acrobatics,tributes and dancing.you can also get down on the main dance floor and have a bit of a boogie while it's all going on.time went so quickly obviously we didn't do much the next day so if your going to Coco Bongos don't plan anything the day after and definitely not the day before you go home!!"

We left the club and we complained to BD Travel who sold us the tickets to Coco Bongo. They launched an investigation and advised me this was not uncommon. They eventually gave me a full refund and this was the very least they could do, I was not provided with an apology. I have since learnt that this is common within the club (please see other reviews).

It's just so different to any club/show we've ever seen before. We got gold member tickets to ensure travel, a good view, a seat and a waiter service. Tip your waiter well and he will dote on you all night, you won't be able to keep up with the drinks! It loosens you up anyway as we were soon singing along and dancing with the rest of the overexcited crowd. The woman in front of us and the couple next to us was clearly off her face on so etching a bit stronger than alcohol and when we were hit in the face for the 20th time by her waving balloons we popped them as soon as she went for a toilet break...I see a few complaints about the drunk girls getting up and dancing on the bar/podium, this actually made out night as we like to people watch. All the girls dancing on the podium knew fully well that a huge blast of air strong enough to lift the tightest skirt was going to be shot up at them and hen acted all coy and 'upset', we thought it was hilarious! Some even went up twice to do it. Anyway, the professional dancers were probable wearing as little as these girls anyway so it wasn't much different from seeing one bum in a thing to another.I politely declined when I was offered the chance....We were seated as close to the stage as you can possible get, although our view was sometimes restricted as hey project images onto the curtains, we still got to see the acts in all their glory.From Tron, Batman, Moulan Rouge to Queen and LMFAO, the cast put in full effort. Some of the areal acrobatic shows are amazing, especially Tron.Yes there were limited toilets for the VIP area, but I never had to wait more than 2 minutes or so. You can always go down to the toilets in the standing area where there are much more.A few people might try and sell you shots or photos, all you have to do is say no, it's barely even a hindrance. Was it expensive? Yes, nearly \u00a3200 for the both of us as a whole. But it was worth it (you are on holiday after all!) In 1 word, the experience was insane and you really do have to be there to experience he whole atmosphere. Our coach pick up was at 3.40am and we were wide awake considering we have been so jet lagged and going to bed at 11pm every night. If you have the money, definitely get the gold member tickets or risk standing in the crowd for 4 hours and being ice blasted from above whilst air aid sirens go off every 5 minutes."

Sad to say, they were wrong! We honestly went determined to enjoy ourselves so it wasn't like we had a negative view from the outset.

After that, we were an afterthought! Now, we don't object to tipping (and in fact we did so) but when tickets are upwards of \u00a385 each you expect good service regardless. Didn't rate the drinks either.One toilet for all 'VIP' guests resulting in very long queues for the ladies. People constantly trying to sell you shots, photographs etc.A handful of the shows were good, particularly the acrobatic ones (4/5 in total, they only last a few minutes each) - the rest were awful! Cannot believe some people liken the quality of the acts to Las Vegas - people dressed up as Britney Spears and Freddie Mercury and miming?! Seriously lol? Over the course of the night, gaps between the shows got longer and we were forced to watch drunk people dancing around on the bar making idiots of themselves instead. Either that, or the 'roaming' camera feed on the big screen - which only seemed to roam as far as the huge bosom of an attractive woman sitting nearby. Even my husband had seen enough lol. Occasionally, the wind machine would blow somebody's skirt up on the bar and a huge cheer would ensue. Great - well worth our \u00a3175 then.I really don't want to sound like a party pooper, but we wished we'd saved our money and spent it in the local bars instead. I can only assume some people just get over excited about being let out of their all-inclusives for the night! We've had some fab nights out since we've been here (staying self-catering in a condo) and it was a huge let down in comparison.I know we're only speaking for ourselves and lots of people love it, but my advice to all would be spend the money on a night out on or around 5th Avenue instead. Some great bars with good music and atmosphere, better drinks and fresh air - some if which are on the beach! I suppose what I'm trying to get at is don't be pressured into going because other people say you'll like it. If if sounds like the kind of thing you wouldn't normally enjoy, you probably won't!"

It was not a problem at all the place was full of energy and amazing shows one after the other. we paid $65.00 for the night and that included all our drinks. I tipped my waiter 200.00 pesos at the beginning of the night and he sure didnt. When my daughter and I were dancing on the bar, he came and found us and handed us drinks up there too.

I felt it was just standing for hours watching videos waiting for the next act to come on. it was packed to crowded for my liking and I just felt squished in. I was on the other side of where the bathrooms are so I didn't even thnk about trying to battle my way through to lose my standing spot.

Taken by minibus for the short distance to Playa Del Carmen bus station.Arrived just after 10pm and was fairly close to the front of the queue. Doors opened at 10.30pm and we were ushered in to an area opposite a bar in the middle on a couple of steps around a table We were introduced to our server for the night who took our drinks orders although we were already given a shot of tequilla and a vodka on the way in. Coco Bongo dancers already on the bar with a count down to showtime on a screen. Show that followed was a spectacle of musical theatre, acrobatics, dancing, amazing tunes. Our server ensured that we never had an empty glass and we tipped him approximtely $15 dollars. It was busy but not rammed that you could not move. We had opted to go on a Thursday night. All in all one of the best nights out that I have ever had and great value for money thinking about the show and the drinks."

            "review": "Fab night!. My boyfriend and I went to coco bongo on 16th September. We'd had to book a week in advance as apparently the week before was fully booked. Anyhoo, we booked through our hotel and paid for the VIPpackage as we'd been told by a couple of people who's been previously that if you get a standard ticket, you stand all night and can barely move as it'd be overcrowded. When booking, we were told that as soon as we arrive, we would be able to walk straight in, no queuing. Admittedly it wasn't as long as the standard ticket queue but when we arrived, we still had to queue for 20 mins with the VIP ticket holders. We were searched by security as we entered and they removed items from my handbag which I was told id need to collect when we left. We were then escorted to the top floor and were sat on stools overlooking the stage and main floor area. At this point, there was still an hour to opening at 11pm and the stools are VERY close together. Once all the VIP's were in, standard ticket holders were allowed in to stand in the main area. Looking over, it wasn't as crowded as I'd been told it would be, but it was out of season when we went so I guess this may account for that. Our waiter was very attentive. When my glass was nearly empty, I'd have another drink in front of me before I'd even asked! I'd definitely recommend tipping your waiter well... You'll get good seats and will be looked after all night! The show itsself is very good but it did feel quite spaced out whilst the dancers changed Into different outfits. In between 'acts', music is played and customers are invited to dance on the bar in the middle of the floor or on the podium. These breaks could last up to 20 minutes or more though and as we were there for the show, not a nightclub, it felt like it dragged on a little longer than it needed to at times. Overall, the whole thing was fantastic! The dancers and outfits were great, as was the atmosphere. We left at 1.30am as apposed to the finish at 3.30am as my other half wasn't feeling well and both of us were still struggling with jet lag but we've both said if we go back to Mexico, we'll be returning to Coco Bongo :)"

There were 11 of us, family and friends aged from 20 to 53 and we all had a brilliant night!! Trapeze acts were really professional and the acts, elvis, freddie mercury, michael jackson, lmao, bon jovi and so many others were all really good fun. Drinks were nice , you could taste the alcoholl but not so much that you couldnt enjoy them and we had a great view of everything that was going on. When the balloons are let out, the place goes mad!!. It was jampacked but that just made the whole atmosphere even better. We were next to the smoking area where you go outside on the balcony which was a good idea as the non smokers in our group didnt have to smell it lol. One tip.... They check your bag on the way in ladies and if you have liquids ie perfume, deodorant etc, they will take it from you and put it away in a locker or something, you sign for it then collect it on your way out, no problem.Men are asked to leave their guns at the door lol.

To start we purchased our tickets through our tour operator in the UK (Thomson) for a reasonable price about \u00a370 each this was for the VIP package and got us into the club for the full night and included all our drinks. There was no transport provided for us so a taxi from our hotel cost about 90 pesos which was not much when converted. We were told that if you wanted good seats in the VIP section then you should go early which is what we did and we arrived at about 2200 hours, we were almost at the front of the queue, the doors opened about 2230 hours with the show starting about 2300 ish.Once inside the VIP customers are ushered in through your own entrance, and then shown to your seats, we were then introduced to our server who explained that he would be looking after us all night and true to his word we never went without a drink, as this was part of the all inclusive package.This club is huge and very high but also extremely deceiving as it opens up to become a lot bigger once the show starts.When the show started all I can say is WOW it was brill with a huge variety of acts and the performers all looking like the people they are portraying. For about 4 hours we had non stop entertainment.This is well worth a visit when in Playacar Mexico.I will say that at your hotels there will be the Coco Bongo reps there and there is a chance that you will be able to get the tickets cheaper through them bear that in mind before booking as they can give a few better discounts too, this was something that I did not know about when we booked this in the UK.Your server at the table who looks after you will expect a tip and this should normally be collected by them at the end of the night before you got home.Don't worry about getting a taxi back to your hotel at the end of the night there are police and official taxi marshall's outside the club who look after you just make sure you get in a registered taxi. Just remember that it will be a long night so don't expect to be back to your hotel until at least 0500 in the morning.For the guys who are reading this who are from the UK and who are traveling with Thomson they offer a Bar Crawl evening which includes Coco Bongo please bear in mind that if you do this you will not get the full experience of Coco Bongo and you will be removed from the club at 0100 when the bar crawl ends, a couple of friends did this and missed out on the best parts of the evening in the club.This is a MUST if you do anything then this should be on your list when in Mexico."

Which wasn't very comfortable at all. We went with thomsons on the Thursday night so we had transport to and from our hotel. The service from our server was great and we didn't tip him till the end of the night. I didn't give a lot but he was very grateful of it. We didn't really drink much as it was such a hike to get to the toilets and fighting through the crowds of people. The VIP section doesn't really give you much room actually gives you no room to dance whatsoever!

A good advice to take if it is your first time going to Coco Bongo in Playa del Carmen, it is to reserve a table on the upper levels. If you choose a travel agency to make your reservations, make sure you ask about the type of service you will be receiving such as VIP entrance so you don't stand in a very long line up to get in. A few things that we did not like are; the fact that they reduce the space you are standing and you can barely move from one side to the other let alone dancing. We had a very bad experience with one of the servers inside the Bar because he asked us to move even tighter to the other people that were staring beside us so he could accommodate three girls that were complaining most of the time because people were too close to them. They told us that the tables were for people that bought alcohol by the bottle like tequila or rum but the ladies that were moved beside us by the server were only drinking water and they got a table. We did not know when we bought the entrance tickets with BD Travel that we could reserve tables or even places on the uppers levels other wise we would have bought them in order to be comfortable in our honeymoon. The Show was excellent through out the evening, I really enjoy the one with Captain Jack Sparrow. If you go try to set your mind for a great night and go rested so you can enjoy it."

The show itself was great. I like how it was done throughout the night so from 11.30 - 3.00 there was something to see and it wasn't just a nightclub, but there was hardly any room still to move and we had a bunch of girls in front of our \"table\" that where squealing and moving around so much I could hardly get a photo and they were more or less sat in my knee!! The waiter was excellent and so was the man who showed us to our table. All in all I think coco bongo is a good night out for the show and something you should experience at least once to say you have but I don't think I would like to go back. Even being 22 I felt like it was all abit too much and found that a lot of the time they were parading women.. Putting them on the big screen and looking down there tops or blowing there dresses up when they where on stage to see there underwear. Abit to sleazy and I feel it lets it down."

We bought the VIP seats up on the second floor terrace and were disappointed that there wasn't much room to dance up there or if you tried you would just block the stage show to the other seated people. So you just sit there and watch an over the top lipsync show. With that being said the cheaper main floor area where you could dance didn't look that appealing either because everyone was packed in like sardines. The waiter we had for our drink service was unbearably slow and we didn't get much for drinks that evening. The show itself was ok but the place hypes itself up so much (\"better then any vegas show\"... This is not true, lol) you may be disappointed at the end. I found this place is definitely geared toward the young bar newbies and been there done that bar-stars.If thats you then you may like it. I will give them an C for effort though. its not that its a horrible show but what you pay and what you get left a bad taste in our mouth afterwards.

It had a great atmosphere, though I can understand some of the more negative reviews however didn't experience anything overly sexist myself.I'd agree that if this place were in the UK it would be shut down for health and safety as well as fire regulations. People were squeezed in and allowed to stand on the stairs to view the show, which would be a definite no no back here. I'd say well worth a visit but be prepared to squeeze in."

It is part dancing/drinking club and part show with sexy dances and cirque du soliel type acrobats above you. My favorite thing of all was the huge cold shots of air blasting over your head. Just be warned because our tour guide did not warn us - when you arrive the line up is huge to get in, but it goes quite fast and when you first get in it is hard to get a table and drinks, but just tip your server well and he will find a space for you and keep the drinks coming all night. It is most defintely worth it to pay the $10 extra to get to the front of the line."

It is really busy always so expect lots of people. Mostly tourists. We were picked up from our resort and Fredy was our guide. He was wonderful and got us a great spot. The shows are every ten to fifteen minutes with impersonators like Freddy Mercury and Beyonce. They also have live acrobatics. They play top 40 music like Pitbull and Calvin Harris. This place lives up to it's promise putting Las Vegas nightlife to shame."

It was not worth it, we had no room to dance and were always being moved and shoved by the waiters. The drinks are vile, cheap alcohol is used and you have to pay more for premium brands when it should be included in the price considering how much you pay! Be wary of the shot girls as they don't at first tell you that you have to pay for the shots! The shows were incredible, the atmosphere is electric and the waiters always bring your drinks over and always fill you up even when the drink you have is only half full. I would return but not to the gold VIP part! Tipping was rather annoying as well like I said considering the price you paying and then you get bugged to tip on top! Big thanks to Adir for sorting our tickets out when we were told it was sold out! He was very friendly! Overall great fun and a good night but overpriced."

They seem to be more interested in showing video down girls tops, under skirts etc. As a few other reviewers have commented quite demeaning to women. Be careful you could quite easily end up showing your underwear to everyone on the big screens, whether you wanted to or not !Another annoying new thing this year is the girls walking round trying to sell you shots, being all inclusive you can always ask your server for shots so not sure what the deal is here, but sitting in the Goldmember section trying to watch the show was constantly harassed to buy shots, I lost count of the amount of times I had to try and manoeuvre round in my chair (the chairs are so close together it is hard to move) to tell her no thank you. A few minutes later it was another one. A big irritant to say the least. If you have not been before I would still recommend it as it is a spectacle which needs to be experienced however I feel it is on the slippery slope so don't think I will go next year. Shame."

We went down for only a quick moment and it was terrible. The show was really great and the drinks kept coming ALL NIGHT! The only downfall I would say was that we were not given adequate information on how to get back to the bus to take us back to the resort. We saw a couple of young girls that went who we had also seen at the resort - I feel like they could have been in a very bad position had we not met up. It took us awhile but we found it. Even though we were all heavily intoxicated. Also, If you are a women please keep in mind that you will be subjected to pretty demeaning behavior. If you dress scantily I suppose that's what you're after and that is what you will get. They zoom in on your 'assets' and put you on the huge screen for all to properly view your figure. It is quite inappropriate in my opinion but it didn't take away from the overall experience. After all, if you don't want that attention then do not dress like a street walker..."

When we arrive, it was soooo packed. But somehow, the crowd seemed to thin out a bit. We were able to dance, get as many drinks as we needed, and find the bathroom without any trouble.On our way in we spoke with other people who had VIP tickets and we were starting to get worried that we didn't have that kind of ticket. In the end, it ended up being us that had the most fun, especially since we were standing right at the bar the entire night. That meant we were getting refills on our drink super easily and quickly all night and all the acrobatic shows were happening right in front of our faces, I was asked to dance on stage, and at the end of the night I was drenched in tequila. This was easily one of the best nights we had on our entire honeymoon!The shows were absolutely unbelievable and something that we will remember for the rest of our lives. And by the way, the waiters in this establishment are nothing short of incredible. We have never seen such manoeuvring!We want to thank you so much for the experience of a LIFE TIME!

We also went VIP which was worth it, i don't think i could have managed standing up on a crowded dance floor all night. We had particularly good seats and could see everything, we were also right next to bar which meant quick service. Our drinks never ran out, our waiter was so good and had drinks lined up ready for us.It was non stop, always something going on and brilliant to watch all the acrobatics going on right in front of us. I'm a Michael Jackson fan so loved his part and my partner loves Queen so that was his favourite part. Something for everybody, I think my parents would also enjoy this as its not just a night out clubbing but its got the same sort of atmosphere.The only thing i wasn't that impressed with was the price of a photograph, i think it should be less than $25 when you have already paid $125 to get in.

            "review": "An amazing night, beyond expectations. I first went to Coco Bongo in 2010. I didn't know what to expect but it was a blast. I was tired and the shuttle from the VIM took forever. Once my girlfriend and I showed up it was a non stop party.So, the same girlfriend and I returned in August 2014 to get married at the Excellence. As a gift to our wedding guest we planned a Coco Bongo excursion. We booked about 3 months out for 18 gold VIP tickets.Booking was extremely easy. We needed transportation, so we searched the internet for a company that could get us both tickets and transportation. As it turns out if you book through Coco Bongo, transportation is included. We bought the tickets and got a confirmation number. Then we had to do a \"online chat\" with a representative to arrange transportation. We also put in a SPECIAL REQUEST. 4 years earlier we noticed a balcony area that would be awesome to watch the show.We asked the rep if we could get this balcony. They do not reserve areas ahead of time but would include our request in the notes.Night of the show! Only 14 of us, we had 4 cancellations. My only criticism of Coco Bongo is the transportation. The largest van the company they contract with can only fit 12 people. So, at pick up time 1 van showed up. Now our group of 14 gets split and even though I bought transportation for 18, the van that picked up the last 2 only had room for 2. So, if no one cancelled we would of had to of taken 3 vans, with all the vans having to stop at different hotels. 12 of my party arrive. I was a little worried the first time we went there was a a rep that walked us in, this time by booking online the 12 of us just stood in line. We waited maybe 2 minutes until someone asked to see our tickets. I showed them our paperwork and explained that we were still missing 2 that we're coming in a different van. At this point the representative noticed we were 4 short. With no prompting on my behave she offered to give us a credit for the missing guests. This was the first time during the night they exceeded my expectations. She also took the names of the missing 2 and said she would make sure they were escorted to us when they arrived. Walking in the place was getting packed. The VIP section looked filled up. I thought there was no way we would get the balcony we requested. I was actually expect our escort to start pointing and saying \"ok 2 of you here and 4 of you over there\". To my surprise he lead us straight to the balcony we requested and removed the reserved signs from 4 tables. This was the 2nd time they exceeded our expectations. It was amazing seeing the faces of our group, everyone was in awe. Our server introduces himself and the drinks started flowing. Amazing services. Amazing service. What I'm trying to say is that the service was amazing. He wouldn't accept a tip at the beginning of the night and the service was top notch all night long. The floor manager also introduced himself, this guy was very professional. He took care of any request made sure that any complaints were addressed. The service was the 3rd time they exceeded our expectations. The show was AWSOME. I had and still have trouble explaining the atmosphere. It's a club with a show and you can't help but have a good time. I had seen the show 4 years earlier. The show was similar but it definitely wasn't the same. The performers are artist, truly talented entertainers. Everybody danced, everybody were amazed and everybody had a good time. The night flew by. During the show the floor manager checked on us multiple times. The woman who had taken our tickets some how found us and gave us the coupon for the no shows. The show was the 4th time I exceeded our expectations. 3:30 , came way to fast and we had to leave because it was our van's pick up time. Here again the company they contract with for transportation let us down. The driver of the van with 12 of us said 3:30 was the pick up time. The driver of the other 2 had said 3am. No one knew we had different pick up times. And at 3:30 when all 14 of us left, 2 had already missed their van. AND the driver was saying the 2nd van was on the way, NO it wasn't on the way. It had already come and gone. Now we had to break up the group again and 4 off us took had to take a taxi. Yes, the taxi did try and rip us off. The first price was $100 to get back, we got them down to $40. No biggie for 4 of us to split. Still, I bought 18 tickets which included transportation. If I had known we wouldn't be coming or leaving together then I would of looked in to other solutions.I appreciate the customer care and professionalism of Coco Bongo. They do a great job and I can't recommend them enough."

It was a lot smaller inside than we expected although it is 3 stories it's compact. The show was a mixture of cold air being blasted from the ceiling, music videos, women dancing on top of the bar, annoying female staff trying to sell you shots even though drinks are all inclusive so why would you pay extra? The show itself was ok, impersonations of the beetles, Madonna etc and some good wire work/dancers in the sky. We did not go VIP and got crammed into the lower area but on the plus side we were close to some of the acts. Good value as it included transport and all inclusive drinks"

The \"all you can drink\" package will cost you around 60/70 USD and the table 300 USD. Despite these premises, the place is absolutely worth at least one visit! The show lasts 3 hours and it's extremely entertaining and involving (after the first couple of performances, people will start facing along with the dancers ), the excellent service is quick and sharp, the music offers mainly commercial hits. Overall, Coco Bongo perfectly keeps up with your expectations and even more! It's strongly recommended!!"

We were greeted with a drink at the door and a shot of tequila in line. At first I was a little overwhelmed at how many people flooded into the place, but after everyone settled into their spots/tables, it was awesome. Our waiter was Miguel and he was great. He just kept bringing drinks without us asking, and I think our tips went a long way for that. It was chaos so we really appreciated not having to work our way to the bar. The performances were amazing and they kept shooting down some kind of cooled air which was a game changer. That crowd would have been miserable if we were all sweating, but no one did. This place is a must see and would have been worth double what we paid."

No to mention the constant smell of farts & body odour - that really took the fizz outta our 'free' drinks.Overall we tried to make the best of it. Would we go again?

Should there ever be a fire I suspect there will be many casualties and even deaths due to over crowding. It would never pass uk acceptability for health and safety.The show was very entertaining and quite funny. I take into account that there are girls who more than willingly get up dancing on the bar and the various podiums knowing full well that the big gusts of air are going to mean they will moon the crowd below. You have a choice and we are all grown ups. The dancers are beautiful and no different to vegas show girls or the Benidorm Palace,they keep their tops on too!We booked our tickets through our hotel and a very nice guy called Omar who was lovely and appeared very honest. Once in the club we didn't see him do could only assume he went home. We got what we were expecting and had a fantastic time.One thing that worries me is the allegied drugging of clients by staff, some are reported here. Had I have read the reports on trip adviser I would never ever have gone. The our cabin crew for a major uk airline confirmed that there have been many cases of men and women having their drinks spiked (date rape drug), and either being robbed or worse. In order to evade going to the police just about anyone will take a bribe or use a situation to extort money. The scarey thing is I was told this was organised by staff in the venue who pray on bunches of men, women and couples. When you buy the vip ticket you don't get to see where the drinks are made, the waiter just brings them to the table. Ours was lovely and really looked after us, he was probably the best waiter I'd had during my entire holiday.Just please be very careful, insist on beer bottles and having the bottles opened at your table. Don't get drunk and go out with a bunch of people you trust and will look out for you. It's not the UK so never let your guard down and its unlikely you will get the same support from the police or other agencies. Great show, I really enjoyed it, just be careful, don't ever go alone and be safe :-)"

When we got there we had to wait in a long line up, by the time we got in the place was packed and there was no where to go. It must be a fire hazard to have that many people jammed in there. I didnt know we could upgrade to VIP which i would recommend to anyone going to pay the extra. Half way thru the show we got a seat in the vip section i guess someone left early and I was with my mum who was sitting down so I assume they were being nice and helped us get a seat. After that I have no complaints, if you have a seat it is worth doing.You can't walk up to the bar to get drinks you have to wait to be served so imagine a jam packed place with servers walking around constantly with drinks, its hard to get served unless you are in VIP."

I am a 6ft tall male and I was very sober and them suddenly completely unaware that my friend was helping me out of the club because he recognized that something was wrong. We had spent the previous night at mandala and had drank all night long so he knew something bizarre had happened to me when I couldn't stand after 3 drinks. We are responsible adults. We aren't party animals or drunkards. We are working professionals. We came to enjoy the show and have some drinks. The server said he'd send some girls over (sort of odd) after we tipped him (he refused the first tip indicating it was too small to warrant his time). When my friend carried me out we were flirted with/touched by girls (he told me, I lost about 30 mins of memory) and the girls tried to take all our possessions. They didn't get mine because I was wearing pickpocket proof pants but they stole his $500 iPhone which we attempted to track but shortly later appeared up in cancan. I emailed the club and received no response. I was told by a server at a restaurant that coco bongo has ties to organized criminal activity. If you go just enjoy the show, do not drink anything that you don't see opened or made, which is impossible as they must bring the drinks to you. I think we both made the mistake of 1) being from the US 2) using our iPhones periodically. Do not go there alone under any circumstance. On the plus side, the portion of the show that I did see was very impressive."

Personally I found this thoroughly degrading, and not at all funny. The shows were mediochre, most of the acts were out of time, but the entertainment was not what I had an issue with. In this day and age girls should not be objectified and treated in this way in a club, and I am appauled that more attention has not been drawn to this at Coco Bongo.

As soon as the bit where they don\u00b4t need women on the bar comes they drag you down only to come and drag you up again 10 minutes later.

I refused to go on the podium, resulting in rude sneres from the staff, my friend went on the podium where there puffed air from the floor to make her dress blow up and show her pants to the whole club. as soon as they wanted her off they dragged her p\u00e1infully by the arm and man handled her off the balcony.We then asked to see the manager (in fluent Spanish so no language barrier excuse) because we felt we were treated in a completely offensive way but were simply kicked out onto the street.On another note, it\u00b4s dangerously overcrowded, you can\u00b4t move, if you try to go to the bathroom you get groped while you try and push through people, crammed in like sardines.DO NOT GO, this club is completely offensive to women, I felt disgusting even being there."

In addition to the usual Spiderman, Mask and Michael Jackson shows that we've seen a number of times, they've added the Pitbull and Beyonc\u00e9 shows which were very entertaining.This time, we elected to go down to the lower level (to avoid the expensive bottle service) since we had already paid for all-inclusive. It was packed but as entertaining as ever. If you haven't been, I can assure you that you have never (and will likely never) see anything like this. It's Mardi Gras, New Years in Times Square, and Cirque du Soleil all in one."

On to the shows there is something for everyone so many different artists/acrobatic shows they also get the crowd involved with balloons/glow sticks etc. it is an amazing night and experience would definitely recommend to anyone going to mexico."

When we arrived we didn't have to wait in a queue. We were taken straight upstairs to a seat and we had a designated waiter who served our area.

If you are 10 feet from the bar it takes you 10 minutes trying to push your way up to get a drink. Then you have to wait another ten minutes to actually get a drink. Oh and if you are no where near the bathroom dont even try to get there. If you are with anyone you will get separated. Confetti falls into your drink and you have to pick it out. The girls standing on the bar block your view of seeing any part of the show. Everyone smells and farts. Don't even go. Save your money. We left and took a taxi back after the first two drinks."

I had heard so much about this place that our group naturally wanted to goWe paid approx \u00a390 each to go into the so called VIP area where we was informed that we would get a table and table service The venue- As soon as we arrived we waited approx 30 minutes in the queue to get in then led to our \"table\" which was around 30cm in diameter only big enough to place our three drinks on. The VIP area was so crammed in that u couldn't even stand up let alone move or dance. There was one toilet cubicle which meant that the toilet queue was constantly huge.The smoking area is on a balcony and you have to walk the whole way through the venue to a small balcony which services the whole club as the evening got busier it was far to dangerous to stand on as the railings are low and it was packed, also no fire escape.Due to recent nightclub/bar fires I was astounded at how little fire regulations were in place. Our table was at the back with a long narrow crowded walk to get to it this was the only way off the balcony.The show- the show started with the dancers on the bar. None of them danced in time and they all looked like they had better places to be. There was some good acrobatics within the show but that was it reallyThey cleverly mixed the live performance with music videos from the original songs. It's done well but I feel it was designed that way as some of the dance routines like Michael Jackson etc were probably too hard for the dancers to do so the music video distracted your attentionThe show was average, no comparison to vegas or a decent broadway musical. Overall- if we had paid \u00a340 for the tickets I would of thought it was overpriced but at nearly \u00a3100 each I was guttedI expected it to be like a superclub where we could dance and have a laugh but we was sat from 11pm-3.30 watching semi ok dancers mime in clearly a foreign language (at 6 nights a week I would of expected the dancers to even learn the songs when miming) There was nowhere to move it was so unnecessarily crammed, waited a while for drinks even though we kept tipping, one toilet for a VIP area that size is ridiculous It's an ok show no way worth the moneyWe are all under 35, the good reviews you will have read are either from older people or 18 year old kids who have never even been to a nightclub before. This place is no better than any nightclub in any UK city and the show no better than one put on at your local theatre.Well overprice for the 5 drinks we managed to get from our \"personal\" waiterMy advice would be to forget it It's a Mexican hype for no reason at all The review on CNN saying it's better than vegas which is plastered around Mexico was a passing comment from a new anchor that the club has used in there mass marketing Complete waste of money!"

So the hotel contacted the Taxi syndicate for me on several occasions however this taxi driver did not want to be found and they could not get hold of him at all, how convenient! I know the bag was definitely left in the taxi as I got my money out to pay for the taxi whilst in the vehicle. The taxi number was 1373 and the name of the driver Lucio Gaspar.

The transfer is a joke and is a large coach with lots of stop offs and they drop off furthest away on the return journey. They say you will not queue but when you get there, a long line of teenagers. We complained and they let us avoid the queue. The inside is a black box with a central stage with lots of young girls dancing on it. I have never seen so many 'dancers' with breast implants in my life. A little bit Spring Break-ish. There is a stage show with trapeze artists, a crazy Beatles medley and a dwarf dressed up as Beetlejuice who then strips. It is hilarious. There are some strangely inappropriate Christ type figures who hang suspended on some red ropes during one routine. A bit weird. Then mixed up with people dancing on a podium. Very funny. If you fancy a laugh, go along. Show starts at about 2315."

Good music, great performers. Was a broadway like show. The performances were based around many old popular tunes, so very nostalgic. Watching the bar-top dancers was interesting. The aerialists were the highlight. Would have been better if there was a dancefloor area just for dancers. Been there done that, was good to experience it."

Personally i thought there was more actual dancers and acrobats back then and now they do appear to rely on video and projecting work. Notwithstanding this its still a great night out. We booked through the Thomas Cook rep and it included a bar crawl and VIP area on a balcony in Coco Bongos all for Approx 75 dollars inclusive of drinks. When in Mexico its a must whatever you age. Dont forget you can sleep on your sunbed the day."

We were staying in the Riviera Maya area so opted to go to Coco Bongo in Playa Del Carmen. My boyfriend and I were booked on the bar crawl option as the gold package had sold out! The bar crawl consisted of entry to 3 bars (Coco Maya, ? and Mandala) and all inclusive drinks (very watered down) before heading to coco bongo around 12pm. As we went through our tour operator Thomson we were in their balcony area above the dance floor for the remainder of the evening. The dance floor looked extremely cramped and sweaty, with not much room for manoeuvre. I was very pleased that we were situated above it all, as we had loads of room to dance and had a great view of the show.The show itself is a mad one, hence the name I guess. It's a mixture of Vegas, music videos, acrobats, tribute acts and people dressed as the mask and beetle juice, all in a club setting!I wouldn't go all the time but I'm glad I've experienced it. Not the best club/show I've been too, however I had such a good time so that must count for something!We paid \u00a360 each for the experience and transport, not bad when comparing it to London prices but I still feel they could have dished out better alcohol!We were picked up at 7:20 and dropped back to the hotel at 2:40.Enjoy!"

We had our own table which was looking over the bar and dance area and was right next to the stage. We had our own waiter service who would bring us free/new drinks as soon as we had finished our last. The show was really good with fab dancing, acrobatics and great presentation. It does get crowded and is very loud but that didn't bother us as i still had space to dance and enjoyed the show. Worth a night out."

However we were glad we went. We booked through our Thomsons rep as we were told we would be on the balcony which was correct We arrived early and whilst waiting outside the staff came and gave us our priority name bands. Following that we had to wait an hour until the doors opened at around 11pm and we were taken to our seats by the waiter who brought us our drinks all evening.At 11.30pm the fun began !.What a show !. There was so much going on ,on the ground floor, up above with the aerialists ,and on the raised stage opposite the balcony., And staff and dancers dancing on the bar below in between serving drinks.There was lots of participation by \"willing\" guests both young and older who were singled out by the waiters and taken up to the stage where they danced,and had blasts of air aimed at them to blow their clothes up, especially the young ladies !.The dancers on the stage gave a very professional and varied show taking music and dancing from the musicals such and Moulin Rouge and others. Also music from Queen etc.. So much variety it was unbelievable, and the drinks kept coming as much as you wanted [ which of course is included in the price of the admission..If you want a quiet night don't go - it is VERY noisy, booming in fact, so much so the place is bouncing !!..If you want a very good night , then do go it's an experience not to be missed.My friend and I lasted till 4.00 a.m [ But I think it finishes at 4.30 or around then ].As I mentioned at rhe beginning of this review, my friend and I are in the older age group but we both thoroughly enjoyed the experience and were glad that we went."

Our first impression on arrival was to turn around and leave, which did not improve once inside...the place is an accident waiting to happen as it's overcrowded and a H&S risk. If a fire broke out it would be pandemonium! We were led through a jostling crowd to one of the upper floors, which was filled to capacity on a wooden supported balcony - one false move and you would be pushed over the top and into the crowd below. We could not see the show, but did hear the music...maybe the show was good? No idea. We had one drink and decided to leave as my friends and I all feared for our lives, and one person felt claustrophobic, even though the venue is large, but it was just the amount of people crammed inside.We managed to escape through an emergency exit door, escorted by staff, then went to find the manager. We asked for a refund, but were told that this was not possible. The manager stated that it was 'ladies night' in the club, hence why it was so busy. We asked why so many people had been let in as we felt unsafe, and she said it was fine...not by British standards!! We also found out that we had been overcharged admission as we paid $65.00 at the resort we were staying in, so were advised to return there the next day to get the overcharge back. We booked through Amstar at our hotel, and the girl agreed to a refund of $15.00 immediately for the overcharge, but not for the remainder. She blamed the venue for the overcrowding, but did admit that she knew it would be bursting at the seems, due to it being ladies night. So basically we were sold a trip under false pretenses. And the 'no refund' was only pointed out to us after we complained and not when we were booking the trip.My advice to anyone thinking of going is this - if you like being a sardine in a can, waiting to be put on the BBQ, then go and have a good time, but if you value your life - STAY AWAY!!"

I actually can't think of a suitable word to describe how crazy and awesome this place is. I wasn't quite sure what to expect as I knew it was a club mixed with shows. However the shows are only 5 mins each and just a medley of songs so doesn't get boring at all. We saw Queen, Elvis, Chicago, Moulin Rouge, Batman & Bane, Samba, Beetlejuice, Ribbon dancers (Excellent) as well as many others. I hate to think how much confetti and steamers they get through a week. There were people of all ages here and I didn't see one miserable face. All I can say is no matter who you are, what age you are - Go to Coco Bongo and I promise you won't be disappointed. I already can't wait to go back on our next visit to Mexico! Oh and we got our photo with the Mask - Totally Smoooooooking!"

We had a great night at Congo bongo, we at first thought it was a lot of money for the gold member bands, but was worth it considering you have your own seats, little more space, and good view of the show. The show was crazy and action packed with very gifted performers, the queen tribute was extremely good, also the phantom of the opera, the mix was good with everyone having a dance between the acts. This is better then any club I've been to before, there was a great buzz and we really enjoyed it, was the best night of our holiday."

It's hard to believe that there isn't a place like this back in the UK. Our waiter (Eduardo) kept our drinks topped up all night and only asked for a tip at the end. The shows themselves were very good and the music excellent. You will find if you are on Goldmember that people do come round offering shots at $5 which is a little pointless as the waiter service is so good that you don't need to pay for any further drinks. The only disappointing part was at the end with the guy selling photos. He was almost encouraging me to pay for a photo despite me saying I couldn't because it would mean I couldn't tip the waiter. Our coco bongo experience was arranged through Thomson and the driver was awful. He was 10 minutes late to pick us up and waited another 30 minutes before setting off, dropping us off in a bus station which felt completely away from any atmosphere surrounding the place. He also wanted us back 30 minutes before advertised. Again he was 10 minutes late and didn't set off for another 20 despite us all being back."

It's common to buy your tickets in advance which I'd recommend as the queue's are so long. Once in there it's very busy but as long as you find a nice spot to stand you're find. We didn't really know what to expect... was it a night club? a show? It's both! The shows are really good and very enjoyable to watch and it's nice you can have a dance inbetween. One note would be that tipping gets you a drink!"

Be ready to be standing up and dancing all night!- Dress comfortably as well. There wasn't a dress code. We saw a wide variety of outfits from tank tops, shorts and flip flops\u2026as well as fancy dresses. - If you are not paying for a table, try to find a spot on the first floor next to the tables. There are steps leading up to the tables and being on the 2nd step is good(higher than the crowd, but not high enough to block the view of the guys seated at the tables behind you)- Also be ready to be emerged within a biiiiiig crowd. Leave your concept of personal space at the door.Shows start at 11:30pm and go every 10-15minutes up to 3am. ***SPOILER ALERT - Skip this paragraph of you don't want spoilers***Acrobats and dancers perform short compilations of songs from well-known singers like Michael Jackson, Madonna, Elvis & Beyonce; bands like Queen & LMFAO; songs from movies like Chicago, Beetle Juice and The Mask. There are also superhero appearances and more. During the shows you see the people dancing at the stage, sometimes \"flying\" through the place, while videos, videos and more videos are projected on the huge screen. That really adds to the performance. I would say that my favorite performances were the ones about music videos and upbeat music that you could dance to. The ones with superheroes were involved reminded me of a cheesy birthday party performance. The more artistic ones like the Phantom of the Opera or the fabric acrobatics felt out of place as well. That is something that I expect to see at the Broadway Across America or Cirque du Soleil shows but not at a nightlife club. But overall, the shows were good and the party props were pretty cool!***They play some upbeat music in between shows to keep the audience dancing all night looooong!! If you like to dance, the night will be gone before you realize it.There are 2 big opportunities to show off your dance moves. If you want you could dance on top of the bar, sharing it with a dozen other ladies; or you (and even your plus one) could go on a little section of the stage that stays open between shows to dance for the entire audience!!!. If you decide to go for any of these, be prepared for the \"Marylyn Monroe\" type of air that blows form time to time.  The CocoBongo in Playa del Carmen is tiny and it gets really really crowded. No matter where you are, it feels that you are on somebody's way. We are glad that we got there around 10pm. It was the perfect time to find a good spot to enjoy the show and keep some personal space. The venue definitely falls short for the amount of people allowed into the club every night. Just go in knowing that you'll be in a crowded party."

The service was horrid but what else would you expect poor servers had such a limited room to manevour, everyone is on top of each other. I kept looking at the balconies waiting them to crash dowm. We thought it was too dangerous (there were other tourists with same mind set) to stay so we left. Unless you are starved and never been to a decent night club its not a place anyone should go."

A group of guys thought it'd be funny to toss beer in the faces of the wonderful aerial artists. It was honestly disgusting to see a room full of \"adults\" behave this way.There was no difference between the VIP/general admission as there was literally no breathing room anywhere in the venue. God Forbid there was a fire, or any situation where emergency evacuation needed to take place... we would have all been goners.TIPS FOR GIRLS: spare yourself the trouble and DO NOT wear HEELS.

The show begins at 11:30pm and goes to 4. We left about 3am and it seemed like they had already finished the actual show and the club just stayed open later. Our hotel recommended we get in line at 10pm and we are very glad we did. We bought the standing tickets. Honestly the people at the tables didn't seem to have as much fun because they couldn't dance. I was worried about standing that long but we were dancing so it didn't bother me. Where the big, white screens are is where the show will be. They go up and down through the night. We were on the bottom floor, second step up facing the screens and it was perfect. We lucked out that they wedged a table by us so we had that to use all night. IMPORTANT: The girl at our hotel recommended we tip our waiter $10 and he would take care of us. She was not kidding. He brought us drinks 4 at a time. I'm not a fast drinker so he was way ahead of me. If my drink was 2/3 empty he would take it and replace it with a cold one. We never, ever were without a drink through the entire show. We tipped him again halfway through the night. He was really sweet. The show consists of some stage show, some ariel acrobatics, and music videos in between. It started with Phantom of the opera and Chicago. It went all the way to \"Girls just wanna have fun\" and all the great music that goes with that, Nirvana, Beyonce, Elvis, even a Spiderman/Green Goblin bit. If you're a girl and you like to dance on a bar then knock yourself out. Get a spot on the floor by the bar and you'll get about 15 chances to get on it and dance. They go back and forth from using the big bar in the middle for service and covering it and using it as a stage. If you go relaxed just wanting to have a good time then you will. Take a siesta before hand and you'll make it through."

We just wanted to go in see a show and dance so we just paid the 30$ out front then they make you walk down the hall to give you a bracelet where they have the prices which is really $17. Rip off. They try to over charge visitors. The worst was when we finally walked I to the club it was so crowded you could not move. They over sold. It was defiently a safety hazard. There are multiple levels and when we finally found a spot to stand dance and watch the show a security guard walked over and told us there is assigned standing and we would have to take one step back that we were not VIP. He soon realize that he put us in the area of traffic and I refused to move people were squeezing through us including the staff. They give souvenir cups which I was designated driver so I for a coke in it as we were leaving. Te cups were large so it was by finished. The security sniffed my drink, stuck their figures in it and told me coke is not allowed to leave the club. After soon realizing that maybe because it's by liquor that it was done they did but it took 15 minute for them to let us leave. Recommend you don't go. There is a dive bar around the corner that plays live music with chill people who are down to earth nice and have great music. Highly recommend that instead of wasting $30."

Waited outside the lobby at the prescribed time with another couple who'd booked through the TA. Coach arrived and the young female organiser told us we needed the next coach. After they departed, we waited, and waited and waited...eventually went to Public Relations and explained what had happened and was told there was only one coach! After many phone calls a taxi was ordered and we were told to contact a named person at the venue who would sort things out for us. Had to pay for the taxi! Found the contact person and the other couple were shown in. Offered my docket/receipt from the hotel and there ensued much discussion. Much later we were taken to the ticket desk and then a lot more discussion and waiting. After a long time, we were finally reimbursed for the taxi and given our wrist bands, then shown to a table on the lower level...I guess we were upgraded? Then the evening could begin!!!The drinks flowed, the show was quite a spectacle of big screen, acts dancing and miming to tracks and a lot of high tech acrobatics. The frequent blasts of smoke and ticker-tape from the ceiling left us with dry throats (despite all the drinks!) and almost lost voices the next day.Was it all worth it? Despite all the hassle getting there and gaining admission (for which we had pre-paid!) the night was great fun...apart from the fiasco of the coach home...but that's another story! Would we go again...probably, but only with full tickets next time!And yes, we paid for the photo with the Mask!!!"

I believe some discussion happened about a minor disability I have as there was some staring and chatting between two blokes, but nothing explained to me or translated.We were placed up a high spot with a good view of the stage. The show had some impressive bits and some amazing performers, but i felt it moved too fast and some of the songs were over just as you recognised what they were. It was overcrowded by the standards of a club back home and it didn't look very safe - lots of people standing on the stairs and lots of people between us and the nearest emergency exit, but we got out at the end of the night with no injuries. My conclusion is that it was an okay night. The others in the party seemed to enjoy it more than me, but I feel there are better night clubs, if you want a nightclub, and there are better shows (try Cirque du Soleil) if you want a show. I'll admit that I don't know of anywhere that combines the two on that scale though."

It's an \"all-inclusive\" bar and disco, but while dancing, you watch both stage as well as aerial dance performances and skits. And by aerial, I really mean spiderman and the goblin fighting a choreographed dance fight 30 feet in the air, flying up to the mezzanine level and back to the floor bar. It is something.On the downside, there are not *nearly* enough bathrooms for the hundreds of people inside, so there is always a long line, and it is so crowded that one can feel claustrophobic, at least before having adequate drinks."

Our bus was late, our host sucked, they dropped us off at a bus station and made us walk to the club in some sketchy alleyway, I we waited in line for almost two hours. Finally we got into the club only to find more line in a small short ceiling stairwell with no ventilation. There were literally hundreds of people pushing everywhere. I got pushed up against a wall my boyfriend was elbowed by a server and told to move which smushed me even more into the wall. People got aggressive trying to push past one another. We kept trying to just be patient but as soon as I saw the actual club was just as packed with people pushing everywhere, I had a huge panic attack and almost passed out. I understand this is Mexico and the laws of capacity are likely different but I freaked out when I asked the security guard where the exit was and he pointed my back in the direction we came in! Are you kidding me? So unsafe!! God forbid there was a fire there - it would be an absolute disaster. I've worked in bars and large crowds for years and never have I felt so suffocated and vulnerable in my life. I was warned it would be very crazy and busy and was totally anticipating that but there is a HUGE difference between packed/crazy/crowded and incredibly dangerous and unsafe. I don't even want to know what it would be like leaving that place after the show.. We paid $140 to be pushed around and suffocated, had to be escorted out by security because I couldn't breath.. and ended up just taking our own cab home to Tulum. Such a nightmare - never again. :("

            "review": "WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE!! Sexually violated my wife. As for the night we were picked up by shuttle as scheduled everything was great, My Wife got a little nervous through the areas we had to drive through. But we were assured by apple as we asked if we would be okay. We arrived to the show and waited in a very long line which surprisingly moved very fast. As we walked in we could not move, not one inch. There had to be 3,000 people in a area made for a max of 1000 (I am not sure the numbers as there was a few levels) to move a foot would take a lot of force. The wife was frustrated and was a very quiet and scared. We walked up to one of the workers and offered them $100 to get a table. They accepted and shoved a table in the middle of the floor for us so we had some breathing room ( literally we were smashed face to face until I got a small 2ft by 2ft table pulled out for us. They had brought us each a drink with the table. About half way through our first drink my wife had told me she had to go pee. Given the place we were at she had asked me to walk her to the bathroom, (I did not have to use the bathroom) I walked her down stairs to the restrooms. I told her I would wait right here for her. I walked into the men\u2019s bathroom to wash my hands ( I didn\u2019t even pee) when I got grabbed by the shirt and drug upstairs and out the back door by the security workers and a few guys not wearing shirts. I wish pushed up against a back wall outside and was asked if I know what this was about. (In my head I was thinking this was part of the show or they wanted to use me as part of the show, boy was I wrong) My wife must have caught a glimpse of me as she was coming out of the bathroom and seen where they took me. She ran after me and outside to see what was going on. (Keep in mind I been at this show for no longer than 10 minutes) As she got outside she started crying and getting massive anxiety and freaking out as there hundreds police were all around with ak-47s. At this time I realized this was not a joke and something is wrong. The head guy (I am assuming) asked me if I wanted to do this the hard way or the easy way. I started shaking very bad as I have no clue what is going on or if I am being detained or what? He asked me what I am doing illegal in his club? I am in awe thinking am I not wearing the correct clothes? Or what am I doing Illegal? I am taken back and shaking as I must have done something very wrong? I hear so many stories in Mexico as people are just taken away and never seen again. All I had through my head was my 3 kids and what was going to happen to my wife. I was taken away from her and she was held against a wall by 3 men. They took me away from the establishment by foot and left not knowing where I was exactly, I knew where coco bongo was from there but they then just left me. I had no idea where my wife was or what was happening. After a good 15 minutes I started freaking out( seemed like hours) as maybe she was taken away ( again the stories I hear in Mexico all that is going through my head is she got taken away. I could see all the police all over but I was very scared to go them as I have no idea what was the right thing to do or who to trust? I am lost, confused and very scared. At this time I started to try and devise a plan as I will not let my family get lost or broken up.I was sitting down a back street thinking of what I could do to save/ find her. If you knew what was going through my head at this time or what I was willing to do to find her even god would not forgive me. I was about 30 seconds of going in Rambo style to save my wife on what was supposed to be the day we were getting married down there. I was ready to die to find her and was preparing myself to do it! That\u2019s how bad it was. Thankfully I see her running towards me. I yelled her name and she came storming to me. I asked what had happened and she was balling. She told me the idiots told her I was on camera doing illegal drugs in the club, I looked at her in awe and disbelief as to what really happened she knew something was not correct as she knows me very well. She told me she was pushed against a wall in front of entire line of people. Her dress they pulled up and searched her. They excessively dug their fingers in her private part as they were all laughing not quickly either as the fat guy who did this was laughing with his other idiots with him( only in the front not the back) . NO GLOVES and in front of a line of hundreds of people. As she is balling they are laughing. They then pushed her out the place again nowhere to go or not knowing where they took me she started running aimlessly, which is when she found me and explained to me what they did to her. Later in the cab ride they told her they thought I did cocaine, obviously I did not as I will later explain. Let me rant here for a dang second please (excuse my language btw I am shaking while I am writing this) Also please keep in mind none of this is directed towards you in anyway. First off I was High honor student. I played on all 3 levels of highschool soccer and even our state team as well. I raced professional motocross for 6 years, I have a professional career in mixed martial arts for 7 years and was a trainer there after I obtained an injury, I have job in which I make nearly double of anyone my age with perfect attendance and job record and many people to vouch. I am also a nutritionist and in the making of starting my own business on health and wellness. I attend the YMCA 6 days a week with all 3 of my kids. For more proof look up my criminal record you will see not one drug related issue as I am anti drugs and always have been and will be. This is one of the main reasons I am with her because neither of us will ever touch drugs ESPECIALLY that one!! They can look at her record too. We have each our own reasons family wise as to why we never will!!In the long run I do not need to show my credentials. They have no video of me doing no such thing as it never would ever in a million years cross my mind!! I am irate!!! They know damn well they singled me out to mess with for reasons we will never know. Maybe someone else had my description or maybe someone disliked me or maybe the little undercover Mexicans they have working there get paid to bring in people doing drugs and must not have had a good income that night so he needed to make a quick buck off others expenses? I will never know. I hope to GOD they could provide a video of whatever they say I did!! That would be one heck of a trick!!Next why would they search my wife like that? And not so much as look in my pockets as I am the one who they claim did this? Was it for fun? Did they just want to frisk my wife? I will never know. To top it off we had to run to a taxi off the beaten path. Costed me 45$ to get back, the gentlemen was so nice I told him I would tip him $20 when I got back to ocean corral. She waited down stairs with the cab driver as I ran up stairs for an extra $20. I get back and tip the man only for my wife to tell me he wouldn\u2019t let her leave unless she show him her \u201c ta ta\u2019s \u201c so he called them , Just great!! After what she been through now she is balling as this man is telling her to do this? She did not tell me until he left because she knew what I would have done. ( smart on her part) After all this on wed night our vacation was pretty much junk. We skipped our Friday night honeymoon dinner and basically stayed away from the rest group we were with and waited in our room. Not to mention touching my wife after another man decided to have a fun time with was not too appealing for either of us which again was not very fun for a honey moon. Now I have a good 4-5 grand stuck in a trip that someone decided to pick on us and almost lost each other so some guy could get a laugh!"

We purchased VIP Goldmember tickets which meant fast track entry into the club, assigned seats and waiter service all night. It was deffinately worth the extra by having assigned seats meant we were in an area that had a small number of guest all with seats so no pushing or showing and you did not have to stand up all night from 11-3.30(thats how long the show is on for), but if you wanted to dance then there was plenty of room. Waiter service was fantastic as he kept the drinks flowing all night before we even reached the bottom it was replaced or replaced even if went warm. The club was air conditioned and we were close to a toilet which only had two cubicles but was spotless as there was a cleaner inside. Having VIP seats also meant you were at the very top where you had the best view of the show which was at the top and fab view of the stage. There were different songs old and new and we loved them all and all the shows such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, Pirated of Caribbean and many others. They also got girls up onto the stage to dance and if you were wearing floaty skirts or dresses they switched on the fans to blow up ur skirt and expose your underwear on big screen to everyone. There was also a person walking around dressed as The Mask and you can have a picture with him which was $20 but we said no, so later on they came round offering it again for $12 and bringing it to you. I would not have wanted to be standing up all night at the bottom being pushed and showed and breaking my neck to see the show. Dont be a scrooge and go VIP !!!"

We paid $10 dollars for bottle service, they brought a brand new bottle of tequila, margarita fresca for a mix, some ice, limes.. shot glasses etc, service was good. The show started and it was pretty great, good music and dancers.. Then we decided to get a different drink from our official server who would be helping us all night.. two kamikazes came to 200 pesos, yet it said it included unlimited drinks domestic and premium for the VIP so that was pretty terrible. One thing he did do was escort us to the bathroom through the vip area, and i tipped him 50 pesos for that. Now to the worst part.. A worker came and asked me if the girl i was with wanted to go on stage, she did, and a kind girl we were talking to next to us also did. When they are on stage they like to blow air beneath you especially if your wearing a skirt.. Girlfriend was wearing tight clothes but unfortunately for the lady beside us she got everything exposed.. So unless your single beware. When the song was done they did not let her leave after demanding to leave several times, and put her in a room with a chain from wall to wall saying she had to go out for the next song because she was \"so sexy\". After some time past, I yelled at our server to go get her and thankfully he did... If not for the 50 peso tip im not sure though. Also, we both had upset stomachs probably from the ice... Beware!"

It was worth the extra money as we were very well looked after. This price included travel to and from our hotel, but we didnt get there until about 10.40, and we were the last to get seated, not that there was a queue, but they must fill the seats with the best view first, and work round to the edge. We were right at the side of the stage, and although we were close, we couldn't see the far side of the stage. It might be worth getting there earlier to sit centre stage!! That said, the show was well done, with a great atmosphere and a few surprises (beetlejuice!!)

We did however choose to pay for the Gold Members tickets and it was worth every penny. We went straight in and was escorted to our seating with a great view. Standard tickets will get you entry onto the bottom floor which is good if you want to be right in the action and maybe dance on the bar in the centre but if you don't like crowds and standing then I suggest you pay the extra. We had great seats looking down onto the stage. We gave the waiter 20 pesos early on and we were never short of 2 drinks at any time. We have premium spirits, cocktails and beer as well as shots of Tequila. We had lots of room to move our seating aside and dance if we wanted. The show is high energy and incredible, suitable for all ages. I went with my boyfriend but it would also be great with friends/family alike. Our transfer was a little late picking us up but there was clear instructions on where they would pick us up and we got dropped back safely. We booked our tickets through Hector, a rep at our hotel.All I can say is pay the extra and you will have a brilliant night with more drink than you can finish"

I went to the one in Cancun 10 years ago so I was hoping to give my friends the same experience I had then. We had a blast! The shows were just as good as I remember. I will admit that the space at the one in Cancun is much better(way bigger) and the prices are discouraging especially when you have like 3 different prices depending on where you sit/stand. I made sure my mom had a place to sit(which she appreciated) and we stood behind her. We were up 1 row higher than the floor, which I liked. Walking in I was a little scared because I didn't want to stand on the floor(way too crowded). If you can try to go on a week-day and pay a bit more for a seat, it's worth it. If you're under say 26 don't worry about it, pay the cheaper price,lol. if you go on a Saturday beware.....SO CROWDED. We went on a Monday.The doors don't open until 11pm so when we arrived at 10:40pm and saw the line I wanted to die. Don't worry, it moves very fast.

The view from upstairs was the best as there are a lot of acts hanging from the roof etc. Great atmosphere!! I would not have liked to have gone anything other than Gold VIP as it was very crowded downstairs and people queuing for drinks. Only downside is that it requires more toilets especially upstairs and the amount of free drink flowing! You will be missing out if you do not visit Coco Bongo."

            "review": "Worth the read- was scammed $300 and arrested. My girlfriend and I decided to check out Coco Bongo. At some point one of the waiters came up to me and said straight to my face: \"you girlfriend has very nice t**s.\" I came up to him and said he shouldnt be talking to people this way and instead of apologizing he began cursing at me. I could have punched him in the face, but instead I spilled my drink over the guy's head. Instantly I was apprehended by 3 security guys who escorted me out. Shortly, the manager shows up with a guy I've never seen saying the guy I spilled the drink on is the photographer and my drink damaged his camera; now I need to give them 300 usd right away for it or they will call the police. After 10 minutes of back and forth arguing the officers who were standing right near us the whole time decided to intervene. They heard both our sides, while the manager kept yelling something in Spanish, and only after I pointed out that the \"photographer's\" shirt is completely dry and how can it be I spilled a drink on him, did he finally went inside. They ended up making me go to the police station because Coco Bongo were pressing charges, to explain my side of the story. Long story short, they said in order for me to be released I need to pay 2000 pasos (160 usd).. Since I had no cash on me, they threw me in a jail cell with 30 other Mexicans while my girlfriend had to go back to the hotel, take out money, come back and pay them.. All in all, after 4 hours in jail I was out of there with 160 usd lighter all thanks to the greediness of Coco Bongo. Stay Away."

The coach collected us from the hotel on time, explained about getting home and how it all worked with the waiter service free drinks and what not. Didn't queue as we were VIP s went straight in security checked and tagged. Taken to our seats with an excellent view, met our waiter who got our drinks so we didn't have to move and inch. The music was great the dancers were great the place start led to fill and kept on filling till we didn't even have room to take a deep breath let alone move. This made us feel very very unsafe. We couldn't get out by ourselves as nobody could move and we asked a server to help us. This is a great place but way to overcrowded and unsafe. Not for the faint hearted or clostrophobes."

It was PACKED!!Didn't really bother us. We got in and found a spot on the 2nd floor that was reserved but the security guy was kind enough to give it to us anyway. We had a guy who brought us drinks from the bar whenever we needed it. Let me tell you we never had to look for him he was on top of his game!The music was a great mix, the shows were AWESOME. We particularly loved the acrobats and the Michael Jackson show. We couldn't believe we lasted 5 hours on our feet dancing the whole time, that's how great this place is.If you're thinking about going just do it. It was really a unique experience."

It was a nightmare! We had to leave early because we didn't want to end up taking a alcohol shower. If you don't want to get bothered by the cleaning guy who kept sweeping the floor and drunk idiots who kept dumping the alcohol on you while they were dancing, get a VIP table on the second floor."

We had prime seats straight infront of the main stage and I cannot stop raving about how Amazing it was!

No one should leave Mexico without experiencing Coco Bongo at least once. Whether you are into clubs and loud music or not, this is definitely an experience! There are shows, concerts, dancing, lights, acrobatics, the list goes on. Although it is definitely crowded and big, the performances and shows themselves are impressive. I have brought several family and friends to Playa and have taken them all there. All of them were impressed, and they enjoy fun in different ways. I have gone there to drink and dance my butt off, and other times I have gone to simply watch and enjoy the performances. You can do either, or both. That's the beauty. Don't be put off by the cub aspect. If you do go, expect crowds and noise, but you really will enjoy the performances. This is definitely a place that shouldn't be missed!"

The staff tried to pack so many people into the bar you literally had someone squished up against you on all 4 sides of you.

Good luck to the owners/management should an emergency like a fire ever erupt. Our group stayed for approximately 30 mins but after our friend had a drink dumped on her decided it was time to leave.

We are in the middle...young 40 somethings on a holiday and looking for some drinking, entertainment and dancing! here we got it ALL.The wait to get in was about 20 minutes (perhaps a lil less) and once inside we were escorted to our \"area\". Its a SPOT (but more than enough) that is all yours...we were introduced to our server and asked if we were ready to drink and what we wanted....from that point it was \"game on\"The place filled up pretty quickly and the folks all around us introduced themselves and quickly started chatting it up (very friendly fun atmosphere). There were dancing girlies on the bar with their bums peeking out (FUN) and big screen tvs counting down the time till the SHOW began. In our case it showed 22 minutes till show time. The music was loud and fun and from many generations (no gaps). Hubby and I people watched for the first 15 minutes or so while we acclimatized and started to feel our dancing shoes!We NEVER waited for a drink. Not once. We NEVER waited to find a washroom or had any trouble in that area at all. I would suggest trying to travel to the washroom together (I did get groped when I went alone ..hahaha). The washrooms were clean and fresh and fully stocked. The servers were fast and fun if a little pushy at times (we did end up doing tequila shots twice because we simply couldn't get the young lady to take no for an answer..:))We even danced on the bar! Not too bad for middle agers! lmao (have to mention here that while I was asked to dance on the bar, hubby was asked to get down..boooo...they told him the bar was only for \"sexy ladies\". He did manage to stay dancing on the stairs for at least an hour while I boogied to his left on the bar! We had a fabulous time...my only complaint would be how ill we were the next day (totally of our own doing)! The shows were fantastic..think Circ de Solei with dancing in the seats between sets! We had a fabulous time! Would totally go again!Ps. We walked home at 4am...totally had no issues! Felt totally safe and had three cab drivers stop to ask if we needed/wanted a ride. Our advice..GOOOOOO, put on your dancing shoes! Have fun!"

Acrobatics, impersonations,dance music from all genres, brief Broadway-type performances, open bar, and a very attentive wait staff. CB is something that you have to see to believe a literal virtual experience to the senses and a total adrenaline rush with music for young and old including: Elvis, Grease, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Chicago, Moulin Rouge, many contemporary and mexican (J Lo and Marc Antony) music as well as Circe De Solis type acrobatics. I saw people from all walks of life and they were all having a great time. There is singing, dancing, confetti, cold steam, and much, much more. The entertainment is AMAZING. Totally worth every penny and I would do it again in a heartbeat. VERY SAFE. In fact, they pat everyone down that enters and take all medications, powders, gels, and liquids for safe keeping while you are inside. Either leave them at the resort, or be prepared to \"locker\" them for the evening. This is for your safety (So noone can slip anything into your drink) or so there are no drugs or weapons inside the club. Every precaution is taken here so you can relax about that. :) Our waiter (I wish I could remember his name) was AWESOME and was very consistent, even shining the flashlight on you, not only to ask if you need more drink, but to make sure you are \"okay\" in general. Superb! Marco is the sales rep that frequented our resort Dreams Riviera and recruited us to come give Coco Bongo a try. I had the time of my life and have never experienced anything like it. TIPS:* If you book their special package for tourists that includes transportation remember that you will arrive JUST PRIOR to the show beginning and will most likely not have a table nor a seat. Standing room only on the floor at this point, so if you need to sit, or are claustrophobic, you will need to book separate transportation and get there when they open to reserve a \"seat\" or \"table\" then you could take regular transportation back. This is something we wish we had been aware of.* It is VERY crowded. Once you get used to it and the show starts, you will forget all about this if it tends to bother you, but once again, any issue can be prevented by arriving early.* ENJOY the show and enjoy every moment!Thanks Marco for convincing us that we would LOVE this experience. YOU WERE RIGHT!"

Just the outside of the club looks amazing. Me and my friend went Goldmember in March, so had seats for the evening up the top and a waiter to bring our all inclusive drinks constantly. My last glass was never empty before the next one was put down in front of me - the waiter brought us a variety of cocktails and shots, and bottled water is available for when your head starts spinning!The show itself is amazing - the Mexicans really know how to throw a party. We spent all night singing and dancing, and got to go on stage for the 'rio carnival' section. It was literally the best, most exciting night out I've ever been on. The show included the likes of Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, LMFAO, Chicago, Moulin Rouge, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spiderman vs the Green Goblin, Madonna, Elvis, The Beegees, Queen and Rihanna. No matter what age you are, whether you're going there to party, to drink, to dance or simply to enjoy the show. You are guarenteed to have an amazing time, it's worth every penny."

We made the mistake of booking a tour bus to take us to Coco Bongo's after being told that our \"Express Pass\" bracelet for $60 would get us in immediately with no lineups. The line was almost 2 blocks long and 8 people wide on a Thursday night! I skipped ahead and asked one of the people at the door how I could skip the line and get right in, and I was told that there was no way to do so if I had the express pass bracelet. I would have to wait in line. I hid my bracelet under my watch and asked another doorman and he told me I could get right in for $10USD each, so I texted my friends to come to the front (I was so far away they couldn't see me) and we got in right away. I was tempted to tear off the bracelet as soon as I got in the door, but they ended up scanning my bracelet after a walk down the stairs and a long corridor. The $10 was well worth it as we got a great table right away in a great location. Drinks were a bit watered down, and our waiter just kept on refilling them with the same drinks without asking. This was great for me, but my fiance and her girlfriends wanted different drinks each time and had a hard time doing so. Our waiter didn't want a tip until the end of the night, but then seemed disappointed by $20USD from the four of us. Not sure what he was expecting, but I thought it was a fine amount. I saw someone else in our area tip $100USD for his group of 7, so maybe I'm a cheap bugger. The shows were great and went on all night. It was not as much of a meat market as I expected, as I observed most groups of people sticking to themselves and not really intermingling much. I was trying to play wingman to my fiance's friends, but the constant stream of entertainment from the bar made it more difficult than expected. It was however a great time with fairly good shows right until closing time at a little before 4am. I would definitely look at other options for transportation and entrance to Coco Bongo's for next time, as the $60 Express Pass seemed worthless while the $120 VIP Pass seemed overpriced."

Firstly you dont need to Q you can go straight in, you have an area reserved with free alcohol and waiter service all night ( which also includes an escort to and from the toilets for the ladies - with 1400 people in the club this is priceless in my opinion!!) we were served by the lovely Williams The show itself was fantastic and the atmosphere was electric from the moment we went inside - we didnt want the night to end!My only gripe is the girls selling the shots get very annoyong after a least 20 times of saying no thank you they still tried to sell us shots! take the hint we have free alcohol why would we pay for a shot!!!"

It is truly spectacular. We paid for the VIP fee, which included bus transportation from hotel, no line-up, VIP section on the third floor, our own table, waiter, unlimited drinks all night, and there was even a guy to lead women safely to the ladies room. I would go back again for sure, it was so fun! The actors/singers did a phenomenal job and got all the famous dance moves right. The show goes from 11pm-3am, and I thought oh my god, I can barely make it to 10 these days let alone 3am!! But it was so much fun that when it was over, I was thinking what? It's already 3am?

Crowd is about 80% under 25, but there were folks of all ages (we're late 40's), some were I'd guess in their 70's. We were warned to get ourselves up to the second or third floor where there's a little more personal space, but we got there late and ended up on the main floor and stayed there for the night. The music was loud, but did not have that annoying heavy bass \"boom-boom-boom\" going on which made it much easier to take. The management runs a very slick operation. Server's were on top of us with refills as soon as our glasses were empty. The performances and video were incredible. Spiderman, Queen, Madonna, LMFAO, Kiss...they were all there performing...the guy who impersonates Freddy Mercury is really good, but then they all were.Warning - if you don't like getting wet, you shouldn't go swimming...if you don't like loud music or being in a crowded environment, then you shouldn't go to a club. WARNING - if you have 18-25 year old daughters, you may want to skip this night...ignorance is bliss they say - your really don't want to see how some of these girls act in this environment."

Then you begin to get pushed, shoved by the waiters who are trying to sit the vip guests who have apparently paid more and you are honestly treated like cattle. There's no where to move so you just get squashed . Then to ruin the night they do this tribute to Maradona so you can image being English how that went down - the majority of English people around us just left .

I suggest to anyone to do the same thing because there are more activities at the main floor and we are at the middle of the show.We never had to wait for drinks.

Glad he did - we both loved it.The atmosphere is crazy fun, the entertainment is fantastic. Lasted until the end and time flied. Lots of different shows, bubbles/balloons and confetti falls from the roof and drinks and dance music between shows. There was many different age groups also. Drinks - not that good! better to drink beer at least then you know there is alcohol in it. Was drinking lemonade vodka but after 4 just felt full of lemonade. Be careful of the girls walking around with shots, you think its for free then they have a small sign low down saying what the cost is (we saw a few people get screwed over).Its annoying that there is staff in the rest rooms who then want tips for their assistance, but I guess its common. I just don't need someone to open the toilet door, give me handtowel or dry my hands.We walked back to The Royal In, only took about 10 - 15 min and we felt completely safe, there was a lot of other people around, a lot of street lights and police/security around. The hotel also offers to purchase tickets with them they then essort you in a group and sort you out when you get there which is great if you feel unsafe but don't do it this way if you are in a wheelchair as you can only access the bottom floor.Wheelchair access - my husband is in a wheelchair and we couldn't believe how accessible everything was, more so than most places. We purchased our tickets the day before from coco bongos and were told \"they will look after you when you get here\". We decided to get there about 15 min prior opening where staff took us straight through, putting out ramps at the step at the door (which we could have easily managed but they insisted). They then had us set up on the bottom floor at a table which was great as there wasn't much seating room. The staff then helped move people on when he had to use the restroom which was a wheelchair accessible bathroom only 10 m away and when we wanted to leave.Would highly recommend to go it was a lot of fun and something completely different."

This place is seriously crazy! Its so fun, the shows great and the waiters are awesome!!The best way I could describe this place is a nightclub/ cirque de soliel/ show all in one! Truly you have to go here this once in your life! When you buy your ticket (75$) it includes your entry and ALL your drinks.. yes yes i did say ALL your drinks! Every single one of them!! So don't worry about bringing extra cash- just a tp for your waiter! :Our waiter was amazing, his name was Estarno.. he brought us new drinks EVERYTIME we were out & we didn't even have to ask!!! We stayed on the bottom level, mostly because we couldn't find another spot as we were late, but Im SOOO GLAD we stayed on the bottom level! You can watch the show, get drinks the quickest and dance the night away!! It was really cool they transformed the middle of the dance floor into a bar, where girls could get on it and dance as well as watch the show!IF YOU READING THIS REVIEW PLEASE GO! I am not a night person but i had no troubles staying up! The energy is amazing! Theres confetti and balloons flying everywhere, the lights everything was amazing!!!!! The show was fantastic too, it was on a screen but than the screen came to life with real people dancing and singing! They re-enacted Lady gaga, beatles, elvis etc SOO MANY celebrities! And while they are switching between acts they place top hits, great music to dance too! If i go back to playa del carmen i am definitely going again! Such a great time, GET LOOSE AND HAVE FUN EVERYONE!Part of our excursion was a drop off and a pick up so we got picked up at 3am but the party was still going on when we left!!!!

I was impressed how clean the bathrooms were. There is a person who is assigned to take care of the bathroom which makes the experience unique and very appreciated.It's not really the best place to dance but it's surely worth it. The only problem is that a shooter girl kinda forced us to drink shooters and then, she asked for money for them or the service. Actually i'm not quite sure.

Even though the place was packed, it was still pretty easy to move around to the washrooms and such. The second floor smoking area outside was kind of nice to escape the crowd and get some fresh air.I would probably suggest VIP if you had a smaller group, or didn't enjoy the crowd scene, but as we had a large wedding party it was pretty easy to stick together.All in all, a cool place to experience at least once."

We read the reviews and decided to pay extra for the VIP/Gold Member status. We didn't have to stand in the long line for the general admission and got right to our bar stools. Our waiter was pretty good getting our drinks, however about mid evening/show we went out for a smoke and when we came back to our seats...our waiter had given them to someone else and had to scamble to get us two more seats. We have been to Mexico numorous time (10 plus) and the show was like a high school production. The big screens would start a segment about an musical artist and then the preformers would be up on stage mouthing the words and didn't look happy at all. I spent more time watching the big screens than the preformers. We thought we'd be able to get up and dance....not so much unless you want to get up on a bar and swing your hips in a 2 foot square area....don't get to wild or you'll land your butt on the floor!!We can now say \"Been There, Done That\"...I wouldn't go back if someone else paid for my ticket. It was pretty disappointing overall.PS. When we were trying to leave our waiter started to hound me about a tip...at $125 a ticket for a 3 hour show I was done shelling out money. Beware.."

            "review": "Great Night Out!. Ive recently just come back from Mexico Riveria Maya. I stayed there for 2 weeks with my boyfriend from Monday 27th January - Monday 10th February. I have to say Coco Bongo was my favourite night of the whole holiday! It was definitely worth the money, we didn't queue to get in as we paid for VIP which was a little bit more money but defo worth having. With the VIP ticket we got our own table, we got unlimited drinks all night and travel on a coach to and from Coco Bongo. I would recommend getting VIP tickets because if you go for the cheaper ones you have to stand up all night and where you stand is underneath the stage where you can hardly see the performances and everything that is going on. That's why I think most people complain that it was terrible and not worth the money because they go for the cheaper option ticket and you don't get much for it. The performances all night were amazing, they definitely got everyone involved and made sure you had a good night. Half way through the night all these balloons and confetti came out of no way and everyone went mental. I loved all the music they played, you've got to love holiday music. Gets you right in the holiday mood! The toilets are very clean and the staff that work in the toilets are so helpful opening your door for you and when you wash your hands give you a hand towel afterwards. Little things like that does make a difference. Throughout the night I got up on stage and had a little dance with people, every time I finished my drink there was another one waiting there for me. The staff were very efficient and me and my boyfriend are so glad we booked Coco Bongo. Was definitely worth the money and if I ever return to Mexico this is one place I will be returning too!"

Travel agent on resort recommended this and he explained about regular fee and VIP fee. A good thing since the rep for Coco Bongo at resort did not. We went for VIP which gave us a seat, table, premium booze, a waiter plus a bathroom on our level. $120 US was well spent. Bus picked us up from Resort with our rep, which was 30 minutes late due to another hotel pick up being slow. Bus was air conditioned and had a bathroom on it. No one needed it but a good idea for when we returned. Buses parked 3 blocks away and rep had us follow him. There was around 200 people traveling the streets at the same time, quite a sight to see. We were put in the VIP line up which was 2 minutes to get through compared to 30 - 40 minutes for regular tickets. Standing out side in the humidity and heat is not for everyone and I am glad we did not have to do that. Up to 2nd floor we went and even though we had a seat, they pack you in. One person seats on a slight higher level and the next person in front of them. You had to get close to your spouse which is always a good thing. If you stood, like we did to dance, there was plenty of room. 2 large screens where the stage is showed old to new music videos with a count down clock on when the show would start. Staff danced on bar floor while everyone was coming in. The floor level was an ocean of people. 300-350 our server said, for a small area and if you include the 2 upper levels they can sit 1500 people. If there was a fire, not sure how all would escape if needed to. Impersonators were all very good and acrobats were amazing. Not crazy about the \"little person\" dressed as The Mask and Beetle Juice, he was quite rude in actions. William our server was on top of his game. When we had 3/4 of a drink left he was there asking us if we wanted more. Didn't matter if it was water, soda, shots or beer. He was there to please. 25 shows were done from 11pm to 3:30 am, with costume changes in between. Music videos kept the crowd going and you could go on lower level to dance on bar if you wanted to. I tried it, it was a fun and exciting experience. Floor was very sticky and you had to push your way thru to get to smoking balcony. I am very pleased we were on left side and not the right since the smell of tobacco was extremely strong. I am sure the club pipes in scented air freshener because at times I could smell cinnamon and citrus but no sweaty body odor. Bathrooms were so clean and had attendants making sure they stayed that way. Security was plentiful but as far as I could tell, everyone behaved themselves. Shooter girls with there whistles were annoying as well as the little person dressed up for pictures with us. They sell fro $20 US and we chose not to buy one. I have never been to a Vegas style show so I can not compare but it was in mind mind compatible. No matter what your age you have to experience this at least once in your life time. We went with the expectation to leave early but the show held our interest through it all and we stayed to the end. We walked back to the bus with less people than when we walked there because for some, the night was still young and they were heading to another party. Buses left on time, they didn't wait so if you were late you'd miss them and we got to do the \"walk of shame\" back through our resort to find our beds. Do your self a favor and pay the extra to upgrade and enjoy the show in the spirit it is intended."

We all loved it. We went VIP and so glad we did. I am so sorry, but I don't remember our servers name. We had excellent service all night (we left at 4am). The music and the performers were fantastic! During and in between shows, young girls dance on top of the bar. Between shows, staff picks a girl or two that can dance on the main stage front and center. Well, on December, 19th 2013, my Aunt was chosen to dance for the crowd. She was so embarrassed, but I think she looked great! The crowd really cheered her on. She thinks everyone felt sorry for the old lady (not true). Unfortunately, the battery in our camera died. I would love it if anyone reading this by chance, took a picture, or better yet video of her on stage that night. We would love to see it. Well, I would have given a 5 star rating however, we were angry when we first got in. Security took my hand held video camera and said we could not bring it inside. You would think when you purchase your tickets they would make you aware of this! I didn't see it written anywhere on our tickets. So I argued with security (cause they said filming is not allowed) and I told them that I discovered Coco Bongo on You Tube and there are TONS of video clips! But nope, they put my brand new, 3D, expensive camera in a small bin on the floor right beside the door to outside. Anyone could easily have grabbed it. Safe and secure? I think not! Good thing our condo was just 2 blocks away so my hubby took it home. Little did they know, my regular camera that they let my keep, also took video. So take that Coco Bongo Security!!!! And of course once the show started, SUPRISE! Imagine that, many people were running video on cell phones and cameras, (Just like I told you security!) So yes I did get some video (until the battery died) and I will post on You Tube (Laurpol1). Next time I will have a fully charged camera and both our cell phones with us! Just a little FYI for those whom also didn't know. So, if not for the stupid rule, it would have been a 5 rating."

We were told to stand in our spot, one level down where the backs and sides of our legs were scraped and bruised from being pushed backwards by the people in front of us.Where we were standing a drink was dumped from above, not nice to be sticky all night long.But the most annoying thing was the little cleaners with sweepers and scoopers coming through to clean up the tissue paper from the floors, moving people around in an area no one could move.

Do I believe this is one of the best clubs on earth? Yes (though I\u2019m not a natural born clubber, I have some worldly experience with them). Have I left this place every time when the sun is in the horizon? Yes for the first two times, not for this one (you know, the age\u2026).This is a massive partying venue, with three floors and a stadium-like layout that will allow you watch you the impersonations of great icons from stage and screen. You pay a steep priced all \u2013inclusive cover and you have to tip your waiter in advance if you want to keep the drinks flowing. However, you end up spending roughly the same than in any other Mexican club a-la-carte (given that your table orders two or three bottles). The show is spellbinding, giving an old time cabaret-like feel to the place. You will be cast into a time machine and lose yourself to dance with oldies and newbies alike. You will enjoy like few other days despite the eternal crowds and the odysseys to the bathroom. It\u2019s cheesy, campy and epic all the time.One minus point I can think of is that some acts look irrevocably pass\u00e9. There are some that, though old, retain a certain charm because they are iconic (Madonna with Vogue, the Moulin Rouge Act, Queen, etc.). Others clearly do not: the Spiderman versus Green Goblin looked wonderful in 2005, but not anymore. I suggest they try something with the Avengers or something. And I\u2019ve always disliked the acrobatics performed with the Passion of the Christ theme for being pointless, off-handed and potentially offensive to believers."

I'm not really a crowd person, and had read some negative reviews on here. Let me say how wrong i was and how glad i am that my wife insisted. This place is without a doubt one of the best nights out I've ever had. You have two choices, either standard ticket or VIP, we paid a little extra for VIP and for us was definitely worth it. We went on a Saturday so was quite busy but with VIP we were in fairly quickly, inside is set out in 3 floors set around a large raised stage. Standard tickets will only allow you on the ground floor which is VERY crowded (not for me but the atmosphere looked fantastic) with a bar in the centre where everyone gets up a dances on. we were on the first floor directly in front of the stage, excellent seats with table service. Our server was Fernando, a great guy who made sure we had drinks all night. We got there around 10pm the music is great and people are dancing but the main show doesn't start until 11pm, once the show starts its amazing theres so much happening all over the place, they cover the bar and your see Spider-Man swing in and have a fight with green goblin, Elvis, queen, Madonna so much more, in between shows the bar reopens and the dancing starts again where you can get in a section of the stage and dance for a bit. There is also a few side shows going on down stairs with the mask or beetlejuice and a mini me. Me and my wife had the most amazing time, when we return to Mexico it will be first on our list to do again. It might not be for everyone and is very busy and bearing in mind I don't like crowds it was amazing.

I was given a place to sit and a table while my friends were dancing all over the place. The drinks were full all night long and the shows amazing. All of us had a great time even when our plans were different, some guys wanted to talk, I was there for the shows and the girls to dance like in a club."

You are assigned a waiter who keeps you topped up all night! We booked through Thomson and got a gold member ticket which i would recommend as it meant we got a table. The club had such a great atmosphere which was completely buzzing from start to finish. The show starts at around 11pm and goes on until 3.30am so make sure you rest during the day before you go!!Literally loved Coco Bongo :)"

We were led to a table in the middle of an isle that was about the size of a big dinner plate for the five of us to stand around. No seating. Everyone had to stand the entire time. The place was so crowded that you could not hardly move. If you did have to, you had to actually push people out of the way. I've been to many college bars and just bars in general and this is the absolute worst I've ever seen. If they had a fire code, they surely exceeded it. You see the reports of some balcony crashing down or a fire in other countries at a nightclub with several casualties. Never could figure it out until I experienced this place. The \"show\" is the most pathetic thing I've ever witnessed. Sad part is there are lots of nice bars with bands all up and down the street that were not that crowded. But, we were first timers and didn't know that. My advise is to just get a cab and tell them you want to go to Coco Bongo and set off on your own from there. Very safe area. Cops at all intersections. They even close off the street so you can just walk wherever you want. I would not advise to get out of the mainstream though."

As the club can get really busy on the dance floor and as a result leaves not much room to move around I would recommend booking VIP tickets which are only \u00a310-\u00a315 more but you get a seat and waiter service all night. Also the stage is elevated so the seating areas give you a much better view of the whole show."

We had a fantastic night at Coco Bongo, the atmosphere is electric and the show is like nothing you've seen before.I personally recommend going VIP its about $100 per person but its well worth it, we had transfers included, all inclusive premium branded drinks, a great view of the show on a balcony with a seat, our own personal waiter (he would never let your glass reach empty) and you get your own toilet so queueing is minimal.This is a late one with the show kicking off around 10.30pm and going on till about 3am. I would say this night out is suitable for all ages over 18."

            "review": "Coco Bongo ='s Must See Show While in Playa del Carmen. We had a group of 12 and went to Coco Bongo last Wednesday night. The show was amazing!!! Seems more like a show you would see in Las Vegas. Our \"lessons learned\" include the following:1) This show is truely amazing!!! A combination of singers, dance, acrobatics, costumes, you name it. The show starts about 11PM and lasts until 3:30am. Be certain you take a nap beforehand2) Our group of 12 was mainly interested in obtaining the cheapest price for our tickets. Hindsight that was maybe not the best strategy (one person from our group did win two tickets during a contest at our hotel). I would recommend considering booking in VIP area (2nd or 3rd level) to avoid some of the crowds that cram into the lower level.3) our seats were on main level, about 10 feet from the center bar. We had 4 tables for our group of 12. We also went on Wednesday night which was ladies night. It was very crowded! I don't exactly know how many people were in the Coco Bongo but it had to be more than 1,000 people. So it became increasingly crowded between us & the bar as the night went on. The club does a pretty good job with crowd control during the show. Some people near us were escorted out by security because they were on the verge of passing out/or were interested in picking fights with guests. If you are clostraphobic in any way, I would recommend booking VIP tickets in 2nd or 3rd row.4) Because it was so crowded, it took about 10 to 15 mins. to make it to restroom and back. Another good reason to book in VIP section because you have a different bathroom to use. 5) Overall the show was incredible. Lots of acrobatics with bungy cords, etc. I would recommend that you check it out while in Playa. It was our groups favorite activity of the week."

We almost didn't go to Coco Bongo because, well, I admit, we thought we were getting a bit old for the nightclub scene and the 11:30pm start time for the \"shows\" scared us a little. We are so glad we went. The energy caught us right from the start. We had VIP tables up top, but immediately knew we wanted to be on the bottom floor near the bar and all the action. We danced on the bar a couple of times. I got pulled into the show with mini-Beetlejuice. The time FLEW by. We never even thought about the time until it was over and we all wanted to go back the next night. Be prepared to get up close and personal with the staff and guests. There is a lot of dancing, jumping, and bumping, but it was all good.AWESOME."

Finally, 4 years ago, I was with some friends and I gave in and went to the Playa del Carmen location (been to Cancun too). The result? I have been back over 8 times now and it never gets old! Every time I travel to Playa or Cancun, I always make it a point to go to CB. I especially love taking new people and seeing the expression on their faces when they walk in. In fact, one the pictures I posted on here (with the balloons) is a picture I took the first time I went. Literally, it was the first thing I ever saw as I walked in.The atmosphere is out-of-this-world, the sound system and lights are world-class, and the show is incredible. If you took Cirque du Soleil, the best clubs in Vegas, and the most fun 1,000 party-goers you\u2019ve ever met, then mixed them all into one\u2026you\u2019d start to get the idea of what Coco Bongo is all about. Does it get crowded? Yes. Does it get crazy? Yes. Is it loud? Yes. But you know what? That\u2019s the fun part. They do a show / performance to every song (search youtube) and they truly entertain the crowd. To top it off, there's no lack of sexy and beautiful people around. A good mix of locals and tourists.I enjoy the Playa location better just because it seems a little cozier plus I like the surrounding bars and restaurants in Playa. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Cancun is amazing too \u2013 just bigger and crazier.There are several levels of entry. It's not exactly cheap BUT trust me, COCO BONGO is worth the money and the experience! If you have the means, get a VIP area as you will definitely enjoy it more and have waiter service plus all drinks included in the price."

They used liquid nitrogen (dry ice) on the stages and the bar area. When you arrive many of the women are pulled up onto the bar area to dance (reluctantly) during the warm up, before the main performance starts. Standing on the bar is not safe in itself (as its very narrow - and probably not legal in other countries). I was one of the females whom was pulled away from my partner to stand on the bar. I was not so keen but went along with it and as I stood on the stage the bar had holes in it that blew up liquid nitrogen on all the females. I guess the ploy was if you were wearing a skirt it would blow up. However myself (and other participants) had leggings on. The liquid nitrogen froze within my leggings and I now have a terribly bad permanent scar on my leg. I was shuffled out the back - when I told the waiter what had happened - to meet with the accident and emergency team who seemed to have quite a full book of incident reports (perhaps I'm not an isolated incident) and unfortunately a very rude head waiter (who pretended to be a Manager). They indicated I had a skin allergy (I dont as far as I'm aware). We asked for a refund, of which they were reluctant. After we insisted they said \"then you must leave\" and insisted we leave by the back door. After one hour of being in the club we were stood on the street (30 minutes from our hotel and to wait until 4am for our bus home) and my leg was now scarred. Thankfully a front of house member of staff overheard what had happened, informed us the waiter was not a manager (as he had posed) and was terribly apologetic. Thank you to him they came out to apologise and offered us a VIP seat and our money back and a place to sit before we got the bus home. We enjoyed the show in the end and a strong rum and coke numbed my pain of the leg until our bus got home. But I am concerned with the health and safety of this club. It is very busy and packed and I would use caution when visiting. Aside from this the show is good fun, and you will have a good time provided you dont get burned by liquid nitrogen (avoid the stage if possible). I hope this is looked into so no-one else gets hurt and also that their waiting staff (only some of them) improve their customer service skills. Given the owner of the club is particularly famous I think he would be disappointed to find out the way in which paying customers were treated that night."

Bathrooms on 3rd floor a total joke - sit on toilet and your knees are under the sink its so crowded. It was okay, but I wouldnt go back. If there was ever a fire - everyone would be dead - too crowded with small alleys and stairs to get anywhere near an exist - didnt feel safe.

You can buy tickets anywhere and everywhere from your hotel to the door at CocoBongo. CocoBongo is always full, so if you dont like to be around many crazy and party people just dont go. The shows are amazing , fantastic. The drinks are free (until 3 am I guess)but not premium. You must go at least one time , but if you are like Me , just go two :) . I recommend it."

We paid for an \"Express Pass\" which we were led to believe would mean no lineups and a table and our own waiter. The van that picked us up was late. The two women \"guides\" played on their phones until we got to Playa then they told us to come back to that location at 3:30 to get a ride back to our hotel. If we were late we would be left behind. They led us down to the end of a very long line up where we waited (in the rain) with other suckers that had bought the \"express pass\". The line finally started moving and we shuffled forward, shuffled forward. Our \"guides\" came to see how we were doing occasionally and our friends asked if indeed we were going to get a table. They take off and after awhile come back and tell us that we could have a table but it only seats two and we have to buy a bottle for $100US! We finally joostle in through the doorway and down the stairs in a press of people. We hand in our voucher and get our wristbands then shuffle along the passageway in the intense crush of people. We can hear music so the show started without us. Finally get past the bouncers who do a fairly thorough frisk and into a theatre that should hold about 400 but has a thousand packed into it and there's at least 250 behind us. The stage is about two stories up and there may be a show but it's hard to see as there is continual jostling as people and groups vie for a place to stand. The only entrance I can see is the one we came in. It took about 40 minutes to get in can you imagine what it would take to get out if there was a panic from a problem like a fire? We left immediately and were assured that they have a fire drill every six months and that they pass all inspections. No matter, you couldn't pay me to go back inside."

Finally, on our most recent vacation while staying at the Royal Suites Yucatan with family and friends, we planned this as an evening excursion. We booked the VIP package through a Coco Bongo representative at our resort. The package included transportation to and from our resort to Coco Bongo. The package also included drinks for the evening. We would highly recommend the VIP package since you have your own private section with seating available, a great view, excellent service and drinks. Also, we have heard that if you don't pay for VIP, and you are on the main floor, people sometimes puke over the railings from the VIP sections - yuck! The music and entertainment all night are top notch - soooo much fun! I would do this night excursion every time we go to Mexico now and will recommend it to everyone! The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because we wished food was served in the VIP package (or even snacks available for purchase) - it is a long evening (10 PM to 4 AM). Also, the washrooms are in the basement - the total opposite location from the VIP section and it takes awhile to get through the crowds to get down there. These are by no means reasons not to go, justs suggestions for Coco Bongo Play Del Carmen for two areas that could be improved. Overall, such a fun night!"

We basically had a chaperone who had a table reserved for us and made sure our bartender took great care of us. Thanks Adrian! The show was unreal and had enough dancing too. I recommend the lowest floor so you can interact with the show and get on stage and stuff!!!"

It is absolute insanity (in a good way) from the moment you walk in the door. The only way I can describe it is like a New Years party that strike's 12 every 10 minutes for 4 hours!! It's basically shows alternating with dancing all night long. Drinks are included with your ticket -- and the servers are awesome... I don't think I was ever empty. Now, here's a disclaimer (and heed my warning if you're at all clausterphobic!) the general seating (cheap tickets) are standing room only on the dance floor. You will wind up jammed like a sardine down there. Seriously. This may be cool for the young 'mosh pit' lovers -- but not for me. Luckily the guys at our resort recommended the VIP tickets (which cost more -- but trust me, so worth it!) You get in earlier, your own seats, private server and can get up and dance whenever you want to and then sit down to enjoy the show(s). Also, the stage is raised so you get an awesome view from the VIP section. Don`t miss it - there`s a little something for everybody. We left grinning ear to ear :)"

The ticket rep who sold us our passes met us at the door, whisked us past the line and onto the floor, and plunked drinks into our hands. We had opted for general tickets on the floor. Yes, it's packed. Yes, people will probably step on you. And yes, it's incredibly loud. But it's worth it - the show is fantastic, the staff are total pros, and the dancers are full-on gorgeous. Would probably spring for a VIP pass next time. But if the cost puts you off, go for the floor and embrace being in the centre of it all."

I feel the experience is overpriced, overrated, lacks originality and it would be extremely useful to get a table, otherwise you might as well be at a bad concert mosh pitting with the stand only room on the floor.What more can I say, Coco Bongo once and it was more than plenty to never go back again."

I just want a said that Coco bongo has one of the best shows i ever see in my life.Drinks and show is the best combination.Even in Las Vegas i never see something like this. Congratulations...Unfortunately i need to advise to all of you a very bad experience that happen to me and my family.We pay $65 USA dollars my wife, my 2 doters and me. Total $260 dollars but in Coco bongo is no seats to watch the show, 80 % of the people stand up for all night and we was in a very bad area full of people one next to another and many people pushing and bothering next to us and we can\u2019t see the show.So after 30 min. we want a sit in a table and i ask to a waiter to find me a nice place to see the show and he tell me to buy an upgrade for $50 dollars more each person total $200 dollars more and i accept to pay and i can sit with my family at VIP area. Then after 15 min one man dress all in black came to talk to me and told me if i want a seat with my family and i said of course...He ask me where we was from and if we can pay the 200 dollars extra and i said yes, we can! and then he told me if I want a save $ 100 dollars and if i give him only $ 100 dollars! He can give me a nice table with premium drink\u00b4s in front of stage for all of us. Of course i accept to save money and I try to give him my credit card to pay the 100 dollars extra and he said that i need pay him in cash, no credit card. But i don\u2019t take a lot of cash, so he told me to go to ATM outside of coco bongo to get the cash and then after i pay him he takes us to the good area to see the show.After this we enjoy so good all night the show with better drinks in better glasses and with very good service.But almost at the end, again another problem.At 2:30 am the waiter ask me for tip and of course i try to give him 5 dollars and he became mad at me and with very bad English he try to said that i need give him 10% tip minimum from total i pay and i told him that i pay 100 dollars tip to one man dress in black name Pedro in cash and that i don\u2019t have any more money. He just turns and he doesn\u2019t come back again to serve us. So i need go for my drinks to the bar.All of you need to be careful and buy VIP entrance and avoid this situation, because is a great show and drinks there. But people like this two guys is the worst i ever meet.  Show 100 pointsDrinks 100 pointsWorking Personal CERO points"

The transport was 15 mins late and we ended up lost going to other resorts to pick up non existing customers! We reversed some way down a motor way and to a resort and was absolutely terrified! Once in the resort we were escorted by security because he got lost! A this point I wanted to get off and try and get a taxi. No one on the bus spoke English not even the driver and we didn't know what was going on. We eventually got to Playa del Carmen at 11.15 and we were the last to arrive and therefore got the worst VIP seat inmafinable. We were near enough right under the stage.when we asked multiple staff members to move we were shrugged off. It seamed that anyone and everyone were aloud to walk up and down the steps next to us and constantly had people blocking our view of the bar/middle stage. We requested seat and a table as I am recovering from a foot fracture and my partner has athritus in his knee and back. Needless to say we were both aching from head to toe from people kicking us in the back from the seats above and behind and people and staff pushing buy us. We were suppose to get table service as well but offetn found we had to go to the bar ourselves to get our own drinks we felt like we were forgotten about and the other tables were definatly recieving better service than us. At about an hour into what little of the show we saw we were offered tall bar stools next to a fire extinguisher and the WC with no table. We then left. So super disappointed. If we had got there in time this would have been a completely different review. The only reason I am writing this is for people to get there own transport and book directly with Coco Bongo's to avoid serious disppointment and over paying. We were offered to go on another free trip and was deeply upset at this to go through the same problems all over again. I think not. Waiting for a better reposnse and at the very least some of our money back and the 200 peso taxi fare back to the resort. Coco Bongo's so keen to get your money treat you like crap and not reimburse you fairly for their mistakes."

We were told these would guarantee us a seat at a table in the VIP area on the 2nd floor but by the time we entered the venue (after a 30 minute wait outside in the rain as our names were not on the VIP list and having to demand to see the Manager to even get in) all the seats were taken. We had to stand for 4 hours and through the whole show. Once inside the venue no one would take any responsibility for the situation with the waiters and stewards just shrugging their shoulders. We were not alone in this respect. The sales hype gives you the impression the VIP area in quite spacious and this really isn't the case - they pack in as many as they can.We travelled to Riviera Maya with Thomson Holidays who guarantee you a seat on their trip to the venue and we understand this was better (but sold out when we wanted to go). As such my advice to UK tourists would be book through Thomsons and not through the Coco Bongo reps who do not deliver on their promises.We did complain to the management of the sales team afterwards and received no response. After threatening to give them a negative review on here we did receive an apology and an acknowledgement that they had 'issues with their booking system' together with the offer of a free visit if we returned which we rejected as we are not planning another holiday to Mexico. Our request for alternative compensation has not even received the courtesy of a reply.All this said the show is spectacular and great entertainment and the waiters do work hard and make sure your glass is always full. However our experience on the evening took the gloss of what should have been a memorable night out. We simply didn't get what we had paid for and been promised. Simon & Bridget"

Purchased this excursion through Jumbo Tours as our friend was really keen to go, having been four times before she said it's great - a nightclub and show in one. I'd only seen a brief video on youtube before so I had little idea what to expect, other than I'd be shattered since the taxi pickup was 10pm from our hotel and pickup to go back was at 3.30am. We had purchased VIP tickets which gives you access to a small table for your drinks but on arrival I was directed to the side of the building which is reserved for VIP Gold Members. This gives you a small table, stools to sit, toilets very close by and a waiter getting your drinks for you, who was brilliant, spoke perfect English and got you another drink as you're almost finished without having to ask. VIP Gold Members area is on the balcony which is directly opposite of the show stage so you have the best view!!We entered the building and it was packed out, a square bar on the ground floor was full of girls standing on the bar top and every square inch of the place was covered by people, it's relatively small for the amount of people they let in so don't expect to be able to move around much!Unless you want to be right in the mayhem on the ground floor this has to be my best advice - when booking, ask for VIP Gold Member tickets! It seems VIP tickets will get you on the a balcony but not necessarily with a seat as someone complained about on the way back.The shows start up every few minutes, mostly tribute shows like Michael Jackson, Madonna, Freddie Mercury as well as Chicago and some other stuff - all of which was highly entertaining and performed brilliantly. They also have what I can only describe as a gymnastic/cirque du solei type show suspended from the ceiling which was also good. In between shows two massive projector screens come down from the ceiling to accompany the loud music where everyone can dance (in the same spot all night) and they invite girls to dance individually or as two in a small railed area at the front of the main stage between the projector screens under a spotlight. When they go to leave a massive fan blows up their dress for everyone to see. As a summary I'd suggest this was more nightclub than show; loud music, lots of alcohol and cramped, therefore suited more to 18-30's who won't mind this and have a good time than someone looking for something more refined - I say this because there were a few 50+ couples/groups in front of me that looked like they weren't enjoying it very much and being 30 myself I had a good time, particularly after a few drinks but would have been a different story had I not had a seat!"

            "review": "A nightmare. March 2013: Heard the hype, saw the lineups and finally made it to Coco Bongo. Where do I begin to describe the nightmare. The show is canned music and lip synching by talentless amateurs. The few minutes of aerial acrobatics here and there are pretty good, but the show is not above hiring a couple of men with dwarfism and using them for cheap laffs. Pounding music, lots of fog machines, tons of confetti, balloons and streamers from the ceiling get repetitive and tiring really fast especially since cleaners are constantly getting you to move out of their way to get the rubbish off the floor but there's nowhere to move to because enough tickets are sold to make sure the floor is jam-packed. We bought standing room only tickets thinking we would be on the floor and dancing and having fun. But there was barely room to stand, let alone to dance. Customers are constantly pushed and jostled by Coco Bongo security staff, cleaners, waiters and women selling shots of some noxious house liquor. Getting in and out of Coco Bongo involves going through a long corridor and there appear to be no emergency exits. Washrooms are hard to find which is surprising given how freely the liquor flows. Yep, it's open bar all night long. Tables for two on the upper levels can be had for USD $225, and for that price there is a little more space, but given the quality of the 'entertainment', I'd definitely not recommend it. Go if you're young and and want to get drunk and haven't yet developed any taste. I went once out of curiosity, but I wouldn't go again. So many other wonderful things to do in Playa del Carmen. Did I mention Bar Fusion, La Bodega, La Parilla de Manolo?"

            "review": "Lots of fun, constant entertainment. We went last week and it surpassed my expectations. We arrived for around 11.15pm and were shown to our seats. I had read that you must keep tipping your waiter so they keep coming back so we ordered the first round but when we went to tip the waiter he told me to just enjoy my evening and at the end of the night if I want to tip him that was great. I never even got to 3/4 of my drink before he had brought another one! When we first got there a large screen said \"8 minutes to the next show\" I had expected that the entertainment was only every now and again during the evening but it was constant from when it began at 11.30pm. There was acrobats, tributes to Michael Jackson, Madonna, Usher, Freddie Mercury etc and lots of crowd involvement. Me and my friend went up to dance on stage with several others during a performance which was lots of fun. There is a \"podium\" in which girls can dance on and it has a wind machine which was very strong and blew up the dresses/skirts. I knew about this before I went and we had talked about getting up for some fun. However, on the night we went the girls who were going on this \"podium\" were (how do you say this nicely?) very tarty and were only interested in showing off their underwear before the wind machine even started! We had gone on an organised trip and we were told that the show finished at 2am and we would be getting picked up at 3.30am. In fact, when we left at 3.20am the show was only just ending. We couldn't believe how quickly it went and how much fun it was. Everyone was in great spirits and I was surprised that there was a big mix of ages (a couple near us where about 70ys old!) The toilet is spotlessly clean and there is a toilet attendant who cleans the toilet after each person.  There is a guy dressed up as \"The Mask\" and another dressed as \"beatlejuice\" who come around and take photos with you. If you like the photos they cost \u00a312.50. I would recommend this night to almost everyone but suggest paying for VIP as we did as the main floor was very packed and not everyone would have been able to see the shows which are amazing. Also, you don't have to stand in line for drinks as you get waiter service which was great"

As stated in other reviews, it really is worth paying the extra for gold member and VIP entry to save all the queues. The waiter service keeps you drinking all night and you won' t miss a thing. You also get a table and seats if needed. The atmosphere is electric, the sound system is amazing, the dancers are fantastic, the acrobats have you star struck and the dwarf has you in stitches and we purchased a great photo so that I could remember the evening 24hrs afterwards and for years to come.

We went as a group of four and were absolutely blown away by the venue, the atmosphere and the show.It is four hours of great entertainment which you will not be able to take your eyes off. One minute you are watching the great acts on the massive stage, next there are people flying through the air on wires then videos playing on the massive screen.Book the goldmember package as you get to see the show from the elevated positions around the club.The only downside to the evening was our waiter (Jesus) as soon as we got there both myself and my friend tipped him $20 usd and $200 Paso respectively, which is about \u00a325, To me this was very generous. Then if his service was good we would tip the same at the end of the show. Then throughout the evening as he got our drinks he would continue to ask for tips so we gave him an extra $400 Paso has the evening went on. After that it got very annoying with him continuing the flap his top pocket for a tip after bringing us a drink, in the end we both got very annoyed and told him he had had enough from us and to not ask again. Considering we spent $108 usd to get in this was poor service. Don't let this put you off as the rest of the staff both service and security were first class.Sort this guy out coco bongo he is a joker."

We made friends with some people in the line to get in so we spent the evening there with them! It was so cool how much variety there was! Lots of dancing with new and old favorite music from USA and Mexico. After a few songs there are skits. My favorite was the Beatles and Beetle Juice and Madonna! It rotated a few dancing songs, a few skits. Also things trapeze acts. Balloons and confetti fly out from the ceiling and every so often a cold blast of air will shoot out to cool off the crowd. I would've definitely gotten a VIP table next time. Standing the whole time is hard and sometimes you can't see good, so getting a table and a bottle service would be the way to go next time. Also the drinks are very sweet. I will definitely go back but just do things differently ;)"

We told him we like to be treated well and if we were going to upgrade to the VIP tickets we would like the best seats in the house. We promptly paid him $120 per person and were secretly wondering, is this going to be worth it?We were picked up at the resort and walked the few blocks to meet up with Alejandro at the club. He personally escorted us to the VIP line which was very quick and then met us inside to show us our fabulous seats and introduced us to our awesome waiter.

Had a brilliant time!One of the couples we met on a tour to Chichen Itza told us about Coco Bongo. A couple of days later, we decided to go. Ticket Purchase: We ordered our tickets the day before we went, and got the Gold ones (which they also call VIP) via their website. We weren't comfortable about giving our card details via chat, so we decided to forego the 10% discount they were offering. Would have been better if they were just giving a discount coupon out, rather than asking people to pay via chat. They were also selling tickets at the resort we were at (Valentin Imperial Maya), but they said they were out of gold, so we decided to try the website. Lines: We arrived at Coco Bongo around 10.45pm. The gold ticket entrance was at the side. Lines were long, but they moved fast. VIP/Gold: Thought that was a pretty good deal! We were up in the 3rd floor (which was a bit scary from the fire hazard perspective), but good because we didn't like to be in the middle of the dance floor. Guess if we went here when we were younger, we would have liked the dance floor area better! There was a dedicated server bringing drinks to you the whole night. Our server, Daniels Garrotero, was particularly attentive, and he kept the drinks flowing! Thanks Daniels for the amazing service. Only thing that wasn't free were the shots (ladies going around with bottles and neon lights). Don't think they cost a lot, but since we were staying in an all-inclusive, we didn't think we needed any more shots. Entertainment: I'm not a fan of impersonators, but entertainment in Coco Bongo is amazing! We enjoyed all of the shows: Brazilian carnival, Moulin Rouge, Beyonce, Queen, LMFAO, Tron, among others. Had a great time! There was a platform in the middle where girls could dance and have a couple minutes of fame! There was a countdown before the show started, and two massive screens that showed either images from the club or MTVs. There were shows and dancing or interactive activities in between. Been to Vegas, NY, Europe, Asia but haven't seen anything like this before... It was different/unique. It was a fun, fun, fun night! :) Washrooms: There was a washroom at the 3rd floor, which was not crowded, and had an attendant. The washroom was a bit tiny, but it was clean. Photos: They also had people taking photos (souvenirs) throughout the night. They are a bit pricey (around $20/25 a photo!), but thought it was our first visit anyway, so why not!Transport: Think they provided free transport back to your hotel, but we didn't take it, as we didn't stay until the end of the shows. We just took a cab back to the hotel. Lots of cabs outside, and if you go to customer service, they will even hail one for you. Had a great time at Coco Bongo! Glad we went there on our last night in Mexico :) Food After: There was a food place by the Gold Entrance that we ate at for the post-party snack. Cheap and good! :)"

You pay $50 to get in and near where you are, a waiter will get your drink orders so you don't have to go to the bar. There are different shows going on in the club, based on the film called The Mask, and the actors are amazing! There is a little box at the top of the nightlub which you can dance in for a minute or two and it will show on the big screen, then right at the very end a pressure sweeping wind will blow upwards on the box and if you're a girl with a dress, it will reveal your pants and that will also show on the big screen. Girls are allowed to dance on the bar, which was quite fun, although I was more worried about falling off as I hadn't had much to drink at that point! There are live acts dancing from ropes in the ceiling and others on stage, the atmosphere is always buzzing! We left at around 3.30am to get our taxi back to the hotel and the club was still packed and full of life as it was when we arrived. The toilets are so so clean in this place, everytime I went to the toilet, I always saw cleaners going in after you to clean up. Normally club toilets are filthy, so I was quite surprised at this.

You won't be disappointed with the acts and surprises :)However, you are packed in like sardines and constantly being pushed and shoved, it kind of ruins the enjoyment... Our waiter and a nearby security guard were particularly rude ( the more you tip, the slightly better the service) however, my advise would be to upgrade to the gold member service so you can watch the show without constantly being pushed around. It was so annoying!! It's an expensive night out, but I would still pay double the amount on standard entrance to upgrade, particularly if you're going as a couple.Great show, but if you are claustrophobic or don't like your personal space invaded, you need to upgrade!"

ANGEL the waiter he was racist to all the Mexican people he toll us to give him a big tip and he was going to serve us some drinks and we did give him a big tip we were 7 of us after we gave him the money he forgot about us and he was only serving American people them we all stared to go to the bar and the same thing the bartender ask also for some money if you want service. But he was not the only one asking for some money also all the waiter were asking for some tips and we decide not to tip anymore thanks to ANGEL what he did to us at the beginning. People if you are a tipper do it at the end of the open bar if they serve you good I don't recommend COCO BONGO It not for the 80 usd that we each pay there are better night club like mandala or coco maya. ANGEL this is for you \"tip is earned not given\" stop being a RACIST and if you don't understand ANGEL \" LA PROPINA NO SE DA SE GANA\""

The staff encourage people (only girls which doesn't seem fair to the boys who like to drop it like it's hot) to dance on the bar, which is fine when they are playing the music videos. I would suggest they have them get down when the actual performers are performing. If you are on the floor, you end up seeing more of drunk girls bums than the performers who are doing a really great job! It was much better when they had the acrobats so the girls could not be dancing on the bar."

We booked the VIP all inclusive tickets through Thomson, probably about \u00a380 each which we thought was pricey but having been there, we now reckon it's really good value. As the show doesn't start till 11.30pm, we had a couple of Red Bulls beforehand but as soon as the show starts, the atmosphere, dancing and the lively crowd would keep anyone awake. The whole place just erupts as soon as your nations flag appears on the big screen. We plus a load of other Brits were singing our hearts out to \"Vindaloo\" and the same was said for most of the songs. The performers and acts were amazing, acrobats, fight scenes, duets, dancing, it was just the most amazing show I think I have ever seen, perfect mixture of show and club.Tip your bar tender reguarly, and you will never be short of drinks the whole evening. Our lovely bar tender, Eduardo, kept bringing us shots of all descriptions as well as beer and cocktails - the pina coladas were very drinkable.Don't miss the opportunity to dance on the bar in the middle of the dance floor!"

            "review": "Overpriced. Firstly, this place is obviously a must see when visiting Cancun or Playa Del Carmen because of its worldwide reputation so you of course should go and check it out. The first time we went we paid over the odds with Thomson for the VIP tickets which cost roughly \u00a390 each. This included free drinks and drink service for the evening and seating in a VIP balcony area overlooking the club. Now, the reason we really felt that this wasn't the right package for us was because instead of having the fun we were looking at everyone else having fun from our seats on a balcony! There was no space (or room) to dance or to move from where we were as it was jam packed and our waiter was pushy for tips the entire evening. Eventually when we left we felt that we had paid over the odds for a so-so cabaret show, and as we didn't drink a huge amount (maybe 3 drinks each?) we really felt shafted. We may have drank more if we weren't just sitting in a packed out balcony and perhaps felt that we were in a club.But, one redeeming comment for this place: a few nights later whilst walking past Coco bongo we were offered free entry general admission; so, we accepted and thought we'd see how things were on the ground floor with everyone else. The show was already about half way through when we got in but the experience was fantastic. Drinks are VERY expensive with shots costing around 200 pesos each and when we ordered a round of 4 drinks we were told it would be 500 pesos before ordering and then when we got our drinks we were asked for 900 pesos. Only when we refused to pay because it wasn't the price we were told did the barman eventually give us the drinks for the quoted price of 500.Anyway, to sum up; I'd personally say the experience is much better going with general admission rather than the VIP package, you actually get to experience the atmosphere, dance, meet people and feel like you're in a club rather than sitting and observing everyone else have fun. My recommendation would be that if you're travelling all inclusive to have a good drink in your hotel before you go so that you don't spend too much on drinks because they cost over the odds."

We got there about 10:20 and the line was sooo long but the guy from the resort was able to get us in quicker and as soon as you go in your offered drinks right away.I suggest if you do not have a paid spot for a waiter like i did not, then pick somewhere close to the bar The show started about 11:30 and it was AMAZING!! everyone in the club young and old knew the words to every song it was soo much fun. Since the place was packed it is a trek just to go the bathroom but after a while you get used to it. For Smokers you can smoke outside on a terrace overlooking the street it isn't very big but you not out there too long. All in all a great experience that evryone must do at least once."

However, the waiter politely refused the tip! He said \"Please pay me at the end, if you are happy with my service\". Well, we certainly were happy and he kept our drinks refilled all night!The show itself is a mashup of broadway shows, tribute acts, dancing, trapeze artists and generally a crazy night.

We upgraded to have two tables, bottle service, waiter, and all inclusive drinks. ALL WORTH IT! All the shows were spectacular and having the space at the table was a must! We stayed at the Grand Riviera Princess and booked with a representative there, Ramon, who was amazing! He helped arrange everything for us and even helped us get seamlessly through the door to our table without trouble. THANK YOU RAMON!"

            "review": "Once is enough. The rave reviews aren't necessarily wrong but they might be getting a little ahead of themselves. As someone who has been to many shows in Vegas, NYC etc etc, I can see the appeal of an all in one entertainment extravaganza. From that perspective, yes it is much more than any one show and it does go for 4+ hours. BUT, the individual performances and talents of the performers really aren't that spectacular. The acrobatics aren't overly remarkable and the performers all mime to a cover track while a video of the real artist plays on a huge screen in the background on the stage. Most of the time, I found myself watching the screen. The tracks are generally live recordings of the real artist with the crowd sound pumped up really high, adding to the atmosphere and making it feel like the crowd is going really wild. There are massive breaks between performances and in those breaks its just average pop music and the highlight is watching the girls from the crowd dance on the stage and then being surprised when the air vents open and blow their skirts up. It really is the highlight of the evening. It kind of feels like a new years eve theme night if it was new year every 20 minutes or so. It's a very festive atmosphere so you will have fun but I'd stop short of saying the show itself is the best thing you could ever see. We (2 girls) bought $45 tickets on the street a few hours before the show as we didn't want to go VIP. Got there at 10.30, battled the crowds on entry and went straight in and claimed a spot at a table in the corner just below the VIP section. You wouldn't want to be in the middle of the general admin section, it was chaos. At least we had a table to put our drinks on. We tipped our waiter $10 at the start and he brought us drinks before we needed to order them but to be honest we told him to stop after about 4 when we got tired of drinking watered down margaritas that clearly had no alcohol in them. I agree with previous posters re emergency exits, there is no way people could get out safely if needed to, there is one narrow passage. Crowd thins out fairly early though as people get fed up with crap drinks, crap drinks being poured on you and fat chicks dancing on the bar/stage getting their skirts blown up. No one needs to see that sh1t"

If you're looking for a bigger venue, then I would recommend going to the Cancun location. The majority of the performances were pretty good; I have no complaints. If I were to complain about anything it would be the cost of sitting in the VIP section. I definitely would not want to be standing the entire night, but the VIP section should include top shelf drinks and not trying to nickel & dime me for all the little extras. All in all it was a good experience."

You start to go in about 10.15pm and the show starts around 11.00pm. The atmosphere on the build up is amazing with staff dancing on the bar. As soon as you are sat your server is bringing you drinks and does not stop all night, at one point with shots we had three drinks each on the table. I must point out we had the gold tickets, these give you unlimited drinks for the night and the best seats to view the show and what a show. We were blown away 4 hours of themes set to music by far the best show I have ever seen from the Mask to Spiderman to Queen and Michael Jackson tributes. There are 2 Coco Bongos one in Cancun and one in playa Del Carmon we went to the latter which allows you to try the bars in 12th avenue. My advice don\u2019t get to drunk before you go in as to miss the show would be quite simply wrong."

We ended up visiting coco bongo twice in this time, I would love to give the venue 5* but for the following reasons I scored it a 4*.Our second visit (for my birthday.) almost never happened. We took the ticket out and placed on the dressing table at the hotel so it wouldn't be forgotten and went for something to eat. As we returned the ticket had been 'cleaned up' by the maid. The hotel reception made two phone calls- one to coco bongo, who said under no circumstances could we come without our ticket (even though they took our name at booking and we had ID) and then to the Thomas cook reps. Their 'manager' Claudia basically said tough luck and couldn't get off the phone quicker, which understandably, on the last night of our honeymoon and my birthday really upset me- especially considering we had paid to visit twice in one holiday and spent over a thousand pounds on trips with Thomas cook. My new husband was shain sent to make some phonecalls and really saved the day! We managed to get hold of our resort rep (Stuart and Kathryn at Gran Bahia) who basically said no problem and emailed coco bongo a copy of the ticket and suddenly we were allowed in?!? Which was great but understandably frustrating that we had been told no chance and were about to stay at the hotel.Secondly, the first time we visited, we were led to the very top floor as part of the tc project (Thomas cook bar crawl) where we were stood on chairs trying to see the stage and we couldn't- there was one female and one male cubicle and the bar was less than a metre wide- with one bartender.we managed one drink in the short 1.5 hours we were inside. The reason we visited again was the parts of the show we did see making our way upstairs were fab- the smoke mists, lighting and visual effects really added to the atmosphere and even though we were actually cramped like sardines, I left wanting more! The Wednesday when we first visited was a lot busier than the second day which was a Monday. Our rep explained it does look unsafe, but the place has lots of secret escapes and they can evacuate in 5 minutes. I actually get very claustrophobic, but felt surprisingly okay in here. You can definitely see Jim Carreys influences!I won't explain the show bit by bit as an element of surprise is what works with the show. It is not the west end, but for a nightclub it is amazing- trapezes over your head, Jackson acts that actually did him justice- humour etc etc. u found myself oohing and aahing at the next 'surprise' that would happen and before you knew it would be another. One tip- if you spend your time recording or taking photographs- you will lose out on feeling the atmosphere. When you look back or show photos to people, you cannot show the atmosphere so it won't seem as impressive! Maybe take one or two, go with an open mind and prepare for a good night."

We got our first drinks easily (after being told it's impossible to get a drink) and as we tipped the waiter he wouldn't leave us alone all night. He kept sending over different shots and different drinks which we couldn't complain about.It's hard to describe the shows themselves without spoiling them but they are a must see. We didn't stop dancing all night long and were gutted when we had to leave for the 3.30am pick up back to our hotel."

Going to Coco Bongo in Playa del Carmen last night was the worst experience we have had. We paid for VIP tickets through the Apple rep at our resort, only to get a phone call at 5pm the night we were going saying they were sold out in VIP. We exchanged the tickets for Express entry and were told they were not going to be busy during a week night, so no worry getting a seat and drinks. We were picked up late and still had to stop at another resort. We arrived one minute before it started at 11pm and had to stand in a very long line 2 blocks down the line. We were told a Coco Bongo rep would greet us and escort us past the line to go right in. That never happened. We stood in line for over an hour and never did get to see the show. When we made it inside, we were pushed, shoved and trampled. We could not see the show at all, but only hear the music because it was packed and overbooked. We finally fought our way up to a doorway, and decided that was as close as we would get. Not wanting to spend 4 hours wedged between people and a doorway. We turned and left, as did others.We were misled from the start.Scam! We are going to complain to Apple and refuse the charge on our credit card.Are there any occupancy laws in Mexico? A fire at this place would kill hundreds."

We have noticed that this year there are more VIP dedicated areas but we chose to stand and found a spot where we were not pushed about or crushed in like others were on the ground floor. Our waiter was geat and refilled our drinks when he noticed that they were nearly empty.

With a VIP ticket, you get straight in through a dedicated entrance.Security is tight and you will be searched and frisked. No problem if you have nothing to hide I say!!We were then escorted to our area which no one else could enter. It consisted of a small table and a bench type sofa which you could sit on, but in all fairness you end up dancing on the back of it.The show is amazing from beginning to end. Cheesy pop, great tributes, musicals and aerobatics show. I had watched many videos of this before I went but still found it amazing. So much more happened but I don't want to give too much away and spoil it for anyone.We had our very own bar tender so didn't need to leave our table. Not once did we have to ask for drinks, our table was constantly being refilled with drinks of our choice and many shots of various colours!!Beware of the shot girls who work there. They walk round giving out shots, but these are not part of the all inclusive and they will charge you for them.Amazing night and I would recommend to all.The show starts at 11pm and ends at 3pm.

So many reviews on here that give the entertainment raving reviews.......either this is the first and only show they have seen or maybe a Christmas pantomime, it doesn't compare to the shows I've seen around the world. They like to quote the CNN broadcaster that said it was better than any Las Vegas show.....really? They even go as far as showing the TV clip in the middle of the show stating that, tacky. She must have been very drunk that night or got free entry and felt she had to say that. Now I know why so many shop traders in 5th avenue offer you cocaine and weed, it's to make a night out at Coco Bongo tolerable, so stock up before entering.The smoking area is a joke, it was raining that night and the area you smoked in leaked all over, it wouldn't take much to repair as it's the size of postage stamp, imagine how overcrowded it was, one day I'm sure it will collapse or set fire (CNN report that!)Anyway Coco Bongo wasn't for me, I would have rather have spent the money on drinks elsewhere.One last thing, Eeeerrrr Michael Jackson special, NO..........I might be wrong here but I'm guessing that it's the same show every night and it's randomly promoted as different specials, the only different is that the crowd claps louder at the point the feature act comes on and the confetti flows more (if that's possible, I'd love to be their confetti supplier, they must make a fortune!)If you have never seen bad mime acts with quick wig changes and bad dancers that are not greatly synchronized, this is the place for you.

The show started at 11ish & finished at 3am it was amazing, I will probably never experience anything like this again & enjoyed the hole night, the show consisted of Queen, Lady GaGa, Beyonc\u00e9, MJ, Beetlejuice, Spider-Man, Tron, captain Jack Sparrow the Mask & so much more, as I stated before I would defiantly get VIP as you will see it will be so worth it : )"

There was nowhere to sit down and standing the whole time was exhausting. There was a long line to get in and out too. But we had a private server who brought whatever you wanted. The second time I went (2013) was with another couple we travelled with and we got the VIP package. There was no line. We went on a weeknight so it wasn't as jam packed. We had a small, private section off the stairs with our own server (Williams) who was FANTASTIC! He kept the drinks coming. The bouncer at the stairs kept people out of out section. We really felt like VIPs! The show was so great and the energy is so high that you don't even feel like you're there for as long as you are. I'd definitely go back but absolutely recommend the VIP package."

It was the one girls birthday and we had ungraded to the VIP section. When we arrived, it was a maze just getting to our VIP section, which was a small platform that barely fit the 6 of us. The server we had WAS AMAZING, there was not a moment our cups were empty ( we purchased the bottle service) but I was hardly impressed with our area. The place was so crowded, I can even begin to describe the anxiety I had. To get to the bathroom, we had to be escorted through the crowds which took about 10 minutes. The place was packed and all I kept thinking was how they HAD to have exceeded a capacity limit ( if they even have them in Mexico). Being involved with clubs my whole life, I know that this facility was UNSAFE. I kept my eye on the emergency exits. The 'Smoking' area was an outside balcony that could hold about 10 people. There was atleast 25 on it when I had attempted to smoke. It was very uncomfortable. The show was probably the best show I ever saw. They were extremely talented and I couldn't wait to tell my family about it. However, I was so uncomfortable, my boyfriend and I left about 3/4 into the show and took a cab home. I later found out, the show went until 3:30 am! For us who aren't used to staying up late, that was a bit extreme. The girl who sold us the tickets said it would end at 2. For the amount of money this club makes, and the cost of our tickets, I am extremely disappointed that the venue was so small and uncomfortable. If you do not like crowds I would definitely suggest NOT going here."

We went VIP, booked through Olympus Tours, for $120/pp (included transportation) on a Weds night (it's cheaper Sun-Thurs). They picked us up and we went to a few other resorts to get some more people before we arrived at Coco Bongo at about 10:30 pm. We didn't wait at all and were qucikly ushered upstairs to some of the best seats in the house, just off of stage left, up in the VIP section. We had about a half hour before the shows started. And here I will ad..for the people complaining about tipping up front...we wanted excellent service that we didn't have to worry about. I wanted to be waited on very well on our last night so I grabbed our waiter as soon as we arrived, gave him $60 US dollars and told him it was our honeymoon and it was our last night and he SPOILED us ROTTEN all night long.He asked our preferred liquors, brought us shots of tequila and as soon as we were able to empty a shot glass, he'd have another,different one waiting for us. If our drinks got low (not empty..just low) he'd bring 2 fresh glasses of ice, the bottle of rum and he'd pour the rum until we signaled stop and then he'd just leave us the can of soda to add as we wished. We essentially were able to make our drinks all night long...from about 11:00 pm-3:30 am. You will also see ladies being brought onstage for backup dancing or to dance on the thrust out part of the stage above the audience. Well, after a few drinks I got brave enough and at the end of the evening..I asked my waiter how girls got picked to be onstage. He immediately grabbed my hand and I was handed off to another employee and they spoke and I was led down, backstage and told to sit on a stool and wait. I was called up for the last song of the night and able to dance with the cast and other patrons. As the curtain closed, a stage manager with a whistle was ushering people quikcly offstage and he pointed me out to the thrust to dance. I got to be out there dancing as the final balloons and confetti fell...it was the perfect ending to our honeymoon. So...feel free to be cheap and stingy and complain about tipping or tipping up front but you get what you pay for. Our waiter HUSTLED his tail off for all of us..all night long and considering he served us for 6 hours..earned every bit of our tip. This place is so packed and I am so glad we paid for VIP. We watched the insanity downstairs, standing room only, shoulder to shoulder, waiting forever to get a drink, people still coming in and for good reason..the shows were wonderful!The performers at Coco Bongo are some of the best performers, dancers, acrobats, aerialists and artists I've even seen. I've been to Vegas 3 times and Coco Bongo is in a class all it's own. We saw acts from Phantom of the Opera, Moulin Rouge, Chicago, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Lady Gaga, Queen, Elvis, Spiderman, Tron, Passion of the Christ, Beetlejuice and so much more. There were balloons and confetti and streamers and dance music too. All we could say was wow... I wish I could remember our waiter's name because he was excellent. If you enjoy live performances and don't mind crowds and loud music, Coco Bongo is a MUST."

We had a table that was blocked by the people dancing on the bar so we couldn't see the show. I'm not usually claustrophobic, but I felt like they let about 3 times as many people as they should have let in. I couldn't move, and getting to the washroom took forever. I can only imagine if there was an emergency, that many people trying to get out the limited exits would be a disaster. I can say that the music was awesome, and we loved the atmosphere with the confetti and balloons. Unfortunately our night did not end well. The person I came with and I were going to the washroom after being fed shots and drinks like crazy by the staff. While I was in the ladies room He stumbled ever so slightly and was immediately kicked out for being drunk (which he hardly was) and I was left in a very scary situation of being alone and not knowing where he was. No one could tell me what happened so I took the risk of checking outside, even though I was told once I stepped outside I could not return. Thank goodness he was outside, being alone in Mexico at 130 am does not sound fun to me. Overall- a very cool place but also very overwhelming and way too crowded. I'll stick to the more low key places."

This included coach transport both ways, priority entrance ( no queuing ) and a seated table with waiter service and unlimited drinks all night !!! We were given a section with seats and a table very near the stage and had a fab view of everything going on. The night was amazing and was so much fun, the entertainment started about 11.30 and did not stop until about 3.30 am there was something for all ages with tribute bands from the Beatles to Queen and Bon Jovi and songs from all the hit musicals with dancing girls, male trapeze artists and flying dwarfs !!! My daughter danced on the bar and on the stage with some of the professional acts. We didn't want the night to end and were very sad to have to leave for our coach at 3.30 am. The show had finished by then but I think you could stay and dance till 5am. There were also balloon cannons and confetti cannons going off throughout the evening and lots of audience participation. This is a night not to be missed and I would definitely go again if I return to this part of Mexico. 10 out of 10 for value and entertainment."

We paid $120 each and were told it was drink as much as you want. We had decided that rather than tipping the waiter after each round we would rather enjoy the show and give him a really decent tip at the end of the night. Service started off good and he even brought us surprise shots. Then he started asking for tips- we were disgusted and thought it was incredibly rude for him to ask for tips. Then he just started avoiding us and we didn't get any drinks for the last 45-60 minutes despite asking him 5 times. Very rude. We had paid a lot of money to be there and found this very annoying. We ended up giving the toilet advisor the waiter's 200 peso tip as she was brilliant all night and never once asked for a tip.It is just a shame that he had to be like this because the show is absolutely fantastic and the performers are amazing. The atmosphere was brilliant. I wouldn't have liked to have been on the ground floor as there are no seats and it was really crowded.Sort our waiters out Coco Bongo!!"

If anyone has a photo could you post it because my camera ran out of battery. The night was fantastic. As soon as we arrived we tipped our waiter 100 pesos which is about a fiver, we got two drinks, then no show from the waiter until we tipped again. We ended up tipping around \u00a312/\u00a314 and only had about 4 drinks. I consider myself a fair tipper, but I don't like being forced to do it. Apart from this, we had a great experience."

Our fee included transportation and all you can drink (tequila, beer, mixed drinks, water, soda). Went with a bunch of friends....it was crazy (in a good way)! There was a long line when we got there, but that moves really fast. We were standing in line for less than five minutes. The security was very professional. I felt like I was in safe environment. As you walk into the club, there is a short path you must follow before you get into the actual club with all the dancing and music. They had drinks available for us along the path. Once we got into the main part, it was great. Performances were taking place: acrobatics, singing, dancing. There were movie and music video reenactments. There was a lot to see! My friends and I were able to dance on the bar...that was exciting! (Sorry, no males allowed on the bar top) we had our own personal waiter at a reserved table. He kept all of our drinks and water fully stocked. Our table was located on the floor which is where most of the action is. However, it was difficult to see some of the performances that were happening on the stage while we were down on the floor. Many of the performances took place on the bar top, so i was happy with our location. My friends and I also got to dance on stage with some of the performers! We had a BLAST! They allow you to take all the pics you want but discourage recording. The club has three levels and, in my opinion, the floor is the best place to be. I would not recommend this place for anyone who does not like being around a lot of people. It was packed! You can not move in this place without touching someone. As a matter of fact, I don't even think you could stand still and not be touching someone. Also, it is standing room only. You will be on your feet the entire time, so wear comfortable shoes! We had a great time! We arrived when they opened. Initially planned on staying for just a couple of hours, but we were having so much fun that we stayed until they closed! I would definitely do it again. I would probably try the one in Cancun next...it's supposed to be a lot bigger."

It was escorted so we were picked up from our hotel and bused to Playa and then back at the end of the night. Our Best Day guy met as at Coco Bongo and guided us through the process, can't stress enough how helpful he was! There was an obnoxiously long line outside but with our passes we did not have to wait in it as we went on a day that we could get express entry with our tour. I had 2 drinks and a shot of tequila before we made it into the arena (for lack of a better word) and at our guide's recommendation we tipped our waiter early and never lacked for drinks. The waiters participate in the show and there are a LOT of people packed together so he simply brought us more than one of whatever we ordered based on how busy he was and kept an eye on us for when refills would be required.The 'arena' was three stories on three sides and a stage on the second floor of the fourth side. We were a bit confused at first as the second and third tier had some sitting or standing room, but our group was shown to steps on the edge of the main floor and lined up standing like we were taking a picture. We didn't stay in place long but some members of our tour group stayed in place all night (I don't recommend that). When we entered there were dancers on the bar on the main floor and on the visible piece of the stage, it was already wild and crazy but not your typical club experience. Two screens/curtains in front of the mainstage showed music videos for the songs being played and had a countdown timer for the show. The show itself was brilliant. There were performances at intervals and inbetween the performances they would get members of the crowd up dancing on the bar and the stage and just generally going crazy. The performances were spot on, the Michael Jackson on stage was the spitting image of the original video playing behind him, and many of the performances included aerial stunts performed right above our heads. All the craziness was interspersed with confetti and streamer cannons, a rain of balloons (all constantly being swept up by careful staff members) and nitrogen cannons blasting plumes of cold air from the ceiling.Overall the party was double plus good, I would absolutely go again and recommend it to anyone.Words of warning: Ladies wear sensible shoes, you'll be on your feet for a good five hours and there is no where to sit. Also, know that if you dance on the stage/bar your skirt will be blown up, there are air jets built right into the bartop/floor. Be prepared for a high energy party and a late night."

I heard you can pay anything from $45-$100 in depending on who you deal with.The positives - the show is entertaining and there is a great party atmosphere full of all age groups. The music isn't bad but its very commercial. That's it.The negatives - Cost - so $70 each for the show & a \"free\" bar didn't sound like a bad deal, but this is far from a free bar. Poor quality drinks - only a handful of local drinks are included and even they are watered down. I sank half a dozen rums and hardly felt tipsy. My wife loves Malibu (there was a bottle clearly visible behind the bar) so I ordered one, but it tasted nothing like Malibu. I asked what it was & a barman said \"it's the same thing\", I said it wasn't & asked for a proper Malibu - a $5 charge which I stupidly paid but again it was nothing like Malibu. Again I queried it with a barman, who then tried to sell me a bottle for $60 & then confessed there was no actual Malibu. Basically you've no idea what are in those bottles behind the bar - very poor from such a well renowned establishment charging $70 per head.Service - service is terrible, staff are rude & are only interested in how much you tip. A barman held back my drinks until I gave him a tip - you gotta earn the tips buddy.Crowded - the place was totally wedged, you could hardly move let alone lift your arm to take a drink. They pack you in like sardines. The waiters basically walk over you instead of around you. Most of our watery drinks ended up over our clothes & shoes. The layout is very poor with only a small entrance everyone has to go through.It was an experience alright, not worth the money in our view. We should have taken the locals advice & went to La Santanera after spending the day at Mamitas Beach Club."

My wife was a sceptical when I suggested going here as she was thinking \"its just another show\" - never could she have beenso wrong! We were in the VIP area, which I suggest to all as you have a small table and seat are are not amongst the chaos of the \"pit\" which did look fab but crazy! The waiters at the table were great and I never had less than one beer at my table and my wife never had a empty glass at any give time - well worthy of the tip he got! The show had a bit for everyone - music, dancing & acrobatics. All in all a great experience not to be missed"

It was plenty crowded, but you could get from where we were standing to the bathroom and back without much hassle. We bought wristbands ahead of time from a Coco Bongo Rep on 5th street, it included express entry and a free TShirt for the normal $65 price. We couldn't find the Rep when we arrived, but I had a photo of him, and that was enough to get someone to take us to front of line and send us inside. We were standing on risers along outside edge of dance floor. A little cramped, and not much room to dance, but close to the action and easy to see everything. Waiter for our area brought out a variety of drinks during preshow countdown, it helped get drinks to everyone quickly. Once everyone had a few drinks, he started taking drink orders, when he could hear you."

It is a show/party that I will never forget and will definitely live again on my next trip to Mexico! It is extremely safe and as a woman, I never felt threatened by anybody. A lot of staff members are there to break any kind of fight before they even start to happen. They come out of nowhere and grab the killjoy and kick him out of the club.The bathroom are the safest I've ever been to in a club. There's a big man opening the door for you and two women staff are waiting for you inside. One opens the door of an available toilet and the other one hands you towel when you're done washing your hands. I have to say I was a little scared before going to Coco Bongo having heard bad rumors about this Club, but after seeing the level of security they have in there, those rumors are busted!If you like to party and dance the night away, do not miss on the Coco Bongo!!!"

The bus trip going was very quiet. There was a coco bongo rep on board and the played the latest dance music. Once we arrived we queued for our bands and entered about 10:20pm. We were taken to our tables then after about 20 mins introduced to our waiter and ordered our drinks. There was a countdown to when the show began on a big screen and different music being played from the last 6 decades!! The show began at 11pm and it was worth the wait!I won't go into detail about the show as I don't want to spoil it for everyone! There was various different acts and acrobats throughout the night and again the music was very varied from the Beatles to LMFAO! The atmosphere there was amazing. We were given balloons and there was always confetti being blown down. You really have to go to experience it yourself!We tipped our waiter at the start and never had an empty glass. He remembered our drinks and would have new ones with us before we had a chance to finish the ones we had!! Every time we had a new drink we were having more vodka and less sprite! The time went so quick you would not believe. Most of the girls in the VIP area were dragged on to the stage at the end to dance with everyone in front of hundreds of people!!Needles to say the bus going back was a lot more lively with people singing and dancing!! We arrived back at the hotel about 4:30am and went straight to the bar with a few others to carry on the party. It was a great experience that anyone of any age should do if you can! We seen people from 18 to 80 and there was music and entertainment for everyone's taste!!"

They weren't cheap as we got VIP tickets for a Saturday night, needless to say we were expecting great service and show for that amount. Due to one of our party being sick we had to transfer our night to a Tuesday. Which was cheaper than the Saturday which we originally paid for, but we didn't mind losing that money as we all wanted to see it together. We went on Saturday evening to inform them that we couldn't make it, and they were very helpful and said it would be fine to come on the Tuesday night. Tuesday night came and when we went to get into the show. The ticket ladies accused us of cheating them and using our booking twice. I have never been treated so badly by any customer service ever. We ended up getting let in as they finally realised it was them that made the mistake. But not after being treated like common criminals in their eyes. Do not pre buy tickets if you plan to go, as they obviously have trouble tracking their own booking system"

We booked direct through Thomsons - afterwards we realised that it would have been much cheaper to book through the Coco Bongo reps or one of the guys on 5th Avenue - also when booking through Thomsons no transport to the venue is included to bare that in mind. Coco Bongo's is promoted as a 'show' as alot of the reviews state - it is not really a show but more of a night club. They put on a 'show' which is usually 1 song where they mime, then a DJ plays about 10-15 minutes worth of music between each act which was a little disappointing as we were expecting a show, The stage is level with the first floor so if you purchase the basic ticket which is at ground level you may struggle to see. We paid alot extra for the gold tickets - the difference being you get a seat and a waiter for your drinks. we were facing the stage which was good but 6 of us were squashed in a row beside the sound guy! Our waiter was a guy called Edwardo - when the first round of drinks were brought to us we tipped Edwardo as alot of the reviews suggested, Edwardo said he did not want a tip yet, to wait until the end of the night and if we felt the service was good to tip him then - fair enough. When we were ready to leave we tipped Edwardo 200 Pesos, he didnt check the money, said thank you and walked away. Not 10 seconds later he came back to us and said that he felt our tip was an insult to him as he had worked hard, feeling awkward we tipped him again. Having paid for Gold member tickets which had the waiter service included - we didnt HAVE to tip at all, so to tip about \u00a312GBP and be told that is an insult to him is just rude! we Had 4 rounds of drinks all night - i dont think that \u00a312 for 4 rounds of drinks is unacceptable! So if you are on the first floor and Edwardo is your waiter just beware of him. Staff come round and take pictures of you with the show people - these cost 20 dollars each but don't just buy the first one that you like as they will come round with 4 or 5 different pictures throughout the evening. If you are a smoker there is a designated smokers area on the first floor outside on the terrace but it took around half an hour for each cigarette break as it took so long to fight our way through the crowds on the ground floor. Doors open at 10.30 but get there early - we got there for 9.45 and there was already a queue outside to grab the best seats. The special effects are very good - cannot fault that at all, long balloons get thrown out for everyone to wave about, huge glitter bombs going off, streamers and glow sticks are all given out. As a nightclub this would be fantastic but as it is sold as a 'show' and the fact that i wouldn't pay around \u00a3100 a person to go to a nightclub i personally wouldnt reccommend it. All of the reviews that say everyone is rammed in like sardines, cant see and that its a fire hazard are spot on. In a nut shell it is more a night club than a show, the waiters are rude, the prices are way too high but if you are going to book, get the upgraded package otherwise you wont enjoy it. Glad we did go to say that we had been however, wouldnt go again."

This was disappointing but we made the best of it. As normal we had a fabulous time. Our waiter told us to tip him at the end of the night and he worked hard and gave us great service (and got a good tip). The drinks were good and he brought us lots of various shots. The only reason I am rating this a 4 and not a 5 is they seemed to cut back on the acts and had a lot more girls from the audience dance center stage. We came to see the acts and not the guests dancing. It seemed like many acts were omitted that we saw in the past. The 8 of us still had a great time, but felt Coco Bongo was cutting back on their show. Our rep promised us better seats next year but will believe that when we see it. Maybe if you go early and do not take the resort bus going, you might get better seats."

This time around the bar hopping package was not available (which was disappointing) so we opted to go on a Saturday night thinking it would be more exciting... Worst mistake ever! Coco Bongo over sells admission tickets on Saturdays and then instead of turning people away when the club is full they forcefully squeeze people in until it feels like you have to keep your hands up just to maintain a little personally space so your hair isn't in someone else's mouth! And because it is so over packed you cannot leave your tiny ounce of a spot to get a drink because 1) you'll get stuck on the stairs trying to come back and won't be able to get back to your group 2) someone will take your spot! I drank nothing the whole time I was there, I had gotten stepped on multiple times, I missed half the show because tall people decided it was okay to stand in front of people who had gotten there first and I almost got into a spat with a woman who refused to stop elbowing me while she was \"dancing\".

Bought four tickets at \u00a370 each from Giovanni at the ticket box on the beach at our hotel - The Iberostar Tucan. He assurred us that as VIP members we would have a fantastic time, including the best seats in the house (eye level with the main stage), fast entrance through a different door plus all sorts of freebies. But the evening went like this: The courier on the coach could speak hardly any English, she didn't tell us where to go when we got off the coach so it was a case of follow the leader. We couldn't see a 'second entrance' so like good Brits we joined the only queue we could see which was very long. Eventually a Coco Bongo worker came along, saw our tickets and escorted us to the VIP entrance, so we felt relieved at that point thinking that very soon we would be inside the club. However when we got to the front of the queue we were told by the non-customer friendly girl on the door that she had no record of our names and couldn't let us in. She radio'd Giovanni who came along and tried to sort it out. I felt we were treated very shoddily and waited so long that by the time we were allowed in there were no eye level seats left.The show was good, though we felt it was better suited to the age of our daughters with us who are in their 20's. There were people in their 60's and 70's who were turning off their hearing aids and leaving early having paid large amounts of money to go, I think it is unfair to tell them it could be their sort of evening - the music is booming and you can feel the vibration through your body. the \u00a370 per head did include drinks but if you are not a huge drinker I would suggest going for the lower priced tickets. We had to chase Giovanni for our freebies which was an oversized T shirt, and some other bits not worth mentioning. My daughters would give this 4 stars but we will go for 2 - much of the reason for this is the way we were treated."

I had heard such rave reviews of Coco Bongo so was really excited about going.We paid extra for a table, however we were all packed in so tightly that I kept getting the guy next to me's elbow in my face!The show was enetertaining, however there was more time between acts than there were of actual shows. Whilst they were waiting they would get girls from the audience to dance on the stage for a bit, and then blow their skirts up towards the end of the song. Not really what I would have paid $200 to see.The service, however was amazing. Our waiter was extremely attentive, and even though he got us the wrong drink a couple of times he was extremely apologetic and got us the right one straight away.Overall I defintiely don't think it is worth the money at all."

There is only one way to describe it and that is \"incredible\".First of all make sure you go VIP as a goldmember, we booked at the last minute on the door, but you can get tickets for the VIP area from your rep. This means you are seated away from the main dance floor with your own waiter and unlimited premium drinks. We paid 70 English pounds each for a show that started at 2220 and went on until 0300 - non-stop. You can stay in the club until about 0400.The show is jaw dropping, a mix of video magic and live performance which I have never seen before and it just doesn't stop for four and a half hours. So if you think about how much you pay for a West End Theatre ticket and then add non-stop drinks then it's amazing value as well as not to be missed entertainment. We were drinking gin and tonic and the waiter brought out the Tanqueray gin bottle every time, so we could we could see what we were getting. Your waiter definitely earns a big tip. It's a must!"

We had to stand on the bench at the top side of the room and hardl got to see any of the show.The music was good and I believe that the show was excellent too.I think the problem was that we had gone with the tour operator and were all squashed into the area that they were provded. We were also restricted to the time we had there, and getting there when the show seemed to have been going on for a while already did not really please us.I would advise anyone to visit this attraction independently and this should let you determine what time you get there and what time that you leave and I would hope that you would also get a better view of the show.Saying that, I did still manage to do my fair share of dancing and singing and made the best of the situation."

Then take advantage of the fact your drinks are included and wait for the show to start at 11:30pm (it goes on until 3:30am but you won't stop being entertained for a minute of that!!)WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!"

First of all I would like to say that we enjoyed the show which consisted of entertainers mimicing the artists and their dancers on a screen behind them. We purchased the tickets through our first choice/thomson rep at the hotel and cost us around \u00a380 each for the VIP ticket which included seats, show and drinks. First impressions were not good. We were told by our rep to get to the venue by 10.30pm and that we would go through a seperate entrance and avoid the queues, when we got out of our taxi and showed a member of the coco bongos staff our ticket he pointed at an entrance door and told us to go to it. We did as we were instructed and went behind a group of people who were also going into the same entrance. As we were waiting other groups were passing alongside us, we decided to follow those people as we were at a standstill and confused about which queue we were meant to be joining. As we were about to go down the steps inside the doorway a member of staff came out, checked our ticket and gave us our gold member wristband and directed us to join the queue (which had formed while we were waiting at the entrance). We waited in a hallway getting very hot and sticky and wondered whether we had made a mistake (already felt like a sardine). We were taken to a table where my husband and my son were instructed to sit on a long bench and my daughter in law and myself were directed to sit on the bench seat below so that all four of us could share a small table which was directly in front of me. Another group of people were then put next to us (when they all got up and starting dancing on the back bench I had visions of them falling on us, eventually they actually left their table and seating area and went downstairs to the people who were standing around the bar area (there were so many people down there that I don't know how they could dance, no wonder more of them tried to fit on the bar to dance), a couple then sat down at the table next to us and as they were only two so it was a better fit. There was a walkway in front of the table (only one person wide) then there was a row of stools which were up against the railings and overlooking the dance/bar area on the ground floor. The actual acts were perfomed above ground floor level so we were able to see them clearly which was good. We offered the waiter a tip to begin with (our rep told us to give the waiter a tip at the beginning and then another tip at the end), the waiter refused the tip and told us only to tip him at the end of the night if we were happy with the service he had given, which we were. When we were sold the tickets as a show we expected a table with chairs/seats around it and we expected artists to be singing, it was nothing like we expected but we still enjoyed it. It was a one off (expensive) experience and should have been better described to us by our rep."

The lion\u2019s share of their wage is obviously earned through commission, so they will basically have no qualms about lying to your face in order to secure a sale. The guy who sold us our tickets seriously mislead us about several things. Also, be warned: If you are expecting this to be like a proper show club where you are sat around a comfortable table with waiter service drinks watching a show before getting up to dance\u2026..yeah, it\u2019s nothing like that. Nothing at all. The inside of the club is basically a rickety wooden structure, almost in a sort of stadium style layout, with tables and people packed in like sardines (our table for five had enough space for two max). This is no place for the old, frail or claustrophobic. The place is so packed and so poorly designed that once full it\u2019s a complete fire hazard. I have no idea what Mexico\u2019s fire regulations are like but I would be absolutely astonished if Coco Bongo isn\u2019t filling their venue way way beyond the legal capacity. If any sort of fire did break out pretty much everyone apart from the people closest to the exit would be totally screwed. Oh, and the Waiters will basically refuse to bring you drinks unless you agree up front to tip them HUGE amounts. Nice. The show itself largely comprises of people in tacky outfits (including a zip lining Jesus) dancing around and miming to cheesy pop songs. There is one very good act (the acrobats) and some of the effects are quite cool (ticker tape and glitter bombs) but it is mostly the sort of entertainment you would expect to find in a Butlin\u2019s style Holiday Camp (except with a slightly larger budget). It may well be a lot of peoples cup of tea, but it certainly isn\u2019t mine! And for Coco Bongo to claim that they are comparable to the top Vegas shows is laughable. It\u2019s not even in the same universe. Honestly, If you want to go drinking and dancing \u2018til the early hours there are loads of good bars and clubs in PDC to visit without having to waste \u00a340/$60 of your hard earned cash on tickets for this overhyped, sweaty, cheesefest."

I recommend booking the VIP experience it's only \u00a320 more and is highly worth it!! With VIP you get a seat and private area. For each private area there is a waiter who gets your drinks all night. With VIP you also get premium spirits so none of the strange own brand Mexican drinks. If you decide not to go VIP you'll still have an amazing night, do however be prepared to get very squashed and hot. You can dance on the bars downstairs and so of the acts do go into the audience of non VIP which is an advantage. Expect to see everything from spiderman flying towards to acts from Chicago. There really is no other way to describe the night other than a nightclub with circus acts and Vegas show all rolled into one! The show finishes at 3( so a good 3 1/2 hours of non stop entertainment ) Don't miss out as you'll really regret it . It is cheaper to book tickets before you fly to Mexico or from coco bongo itself as opposed to buying them through your holiday rep. "

They have a live show, which was somewhat entertaining, but the few times they did play music, it was very outdated. Like early 90s outdated. If you are not VIP, there is no place for you to sit. The cocobongo drink was purely juice. It is not a big place, so we were very crowded also. If you pay for VIP, it won't be any less crowded either. When we left the venue, we noticed there were other clubs down the small strip with much better music. But we had to go home, so we couldn't try another place.

I admit that I was a bit sceptical beforehand because of the mixed reviews I'd read about overcrowding and expensive prices but it was worth the effort in the end.We bought our tickets on the night, around 9ish. There was a ticket seller just outside the club who told us about the different options. We had the choice of a table with two bottles of spirits for $95 or no table and unlimited booze for $75. As a group of a Brit (me), Aussies and Irish, we opted for the latter, knowing that the two bottles wouldn't get us very far! Plus I'd read bad reviews about the table service.Our $75 tickets also included two hours of free drinks at Se\u00f1or Frog's, a quirky bar down by the beach (the opposite end to Coco Bongo). When we got to the bar we were told that we could order anything we wanted from the menu, so we girls loaded up on the cocktails while the guys chose to stick to beer. We headed to the club around 11.30 and there was no queue outside so we walked straight in. When we finally got to the main room (you have to go through a mini maze of dark corridors and security, but you get a free shot of tequila for your troubles!) we were amazed to see how busy it already was. We entered right in the middle of a show so we had performers in harnesses swinging above us. We didn't even have to go to the bar as they have waiters walking the floor. The guy asked for our drinks order and came back less than five minutes later. After about 15 minutes of dancing and acclimatising to the randomness of everything, one of the bouncers asked us girls if we wanted to dance up on the bar in the middle of the room. We had the best view of all the stage performances from up there, with the performers in harnesses within touching distance, and the drinks were pretty much on tap as we only had to crouch down and ask the barmen to make us another. There was a LOT of confetti (I feel sorry for the guys who have to clean up every night), endless streamers, very cold dry ice and colourful balloons in between acts and the music was a brilliant mix of current songs and old skool tunes.We left around 4ish (I think) and there were lots of taxis outside ready to take people home. We walked as our hotel was pretty close by and the streets were safe.I can't recommend this place enough. You need to go for the experience. The ticket price is quite steep but you make up for it with the open bar (and free pre-club drinks). I wouldn't recommend getting a table because they looked tiny and you still had to stand anyway. Plus the main action is on the dancefloor/bar. The shows are entertaining and everyone is there to have a good time. Oh, and they have the cleanest toilets I've ever seen in a club. The staff in there ensure the cubicles are in good condition for the next people.If you only do one thing in Playa, make sure it's Coco Bongo."

This one is completely different, the dancers look uninterested, no one sings live they all mime and badly. We got VIP as we were told you get the best view, seats and waiter service. Just before the show began they let non VIPS in the row infront of us that was meant to be empty, which in turn blocked our view meaning the paid half of what we did and got a better view and waiter service.

The show itself lasts for hours, we got to the venue just before 11pm and the show starts at 11.30pm and goes on until 3.30am. All the acts were really good, our favourite were the acrobats and the batman spoof. The music was really good, all current club favourites and I was singing along to all of it. If your a bit older, they do have The Beatles and Elvis parts of the show so it suits all ages, we had a varied mix of ages in our tour group and they all seemed to enjoy it.Overall, if your going to this part of Mexico, I urge to DEFINATELY book at least one night here. We went on a Monday night and that was still mega busy, I can only imagine what a Friday or Saturday night would look like. The show is amazing and keeps you entertained. The music is current and the DJ does really good mixes.Only things I would suggest are to book through someone like Thomson, who will take you and pick you up, it includes a seating area {usually sectioned off} and drinks easily accessible with a good view of stages.Show finishes just before 3.30 (just a few mins) we left so we could go into the shop downstairs to grab a t-shirt or 2 as our coach was due to leave 15 mins later, so if like me you like to have a momento, just bear it in mind. I had an amazing time, definitely one of the highlights of my trip."

The building layout is kind of ridiculous, they have too many tables that take up too much space for the amount of people they try and squeeze in. If you wanted to see the show you'd have to be lucky enough to get a spot by the railing, which they 'reserve.' If not, youre standing behinde rows of people who are also trying to dance at the same time, so you really can't see much. They really need to input a maximum capacity, it was really hard to enjoy the experience. I understand that it is a club, but it's not just a club, it's a show, that 3/4 of the can't see.

The night was good up until this point. Coco Bongo is a death trap. The Thomas Cook VIP Balcony is the highest point in the building with one toilet for the ladies and one urinal and sink for the men. Despite promising they would only sell 60 tickets, Thomas Cook sold 120 and we were herded into the tiny balcony where we were crushed. I saw customers climbing onto scaffolding to avoid being crushed and ladies urinating in the men's sink. There was no \"view\", you could not see the show or even the stage from the height we were at. There were no drinks despite being an all inclusive night . The Coco Bongo leaflet says \"show and disco\". It is neither of these things. The show consists of dancers miming to show tunes, in tacky costumes and there is no way it can call itself a disco! There was no room to move let alone dance, drink and socialise. We left after 5 minutes of the show starting, although it took us 15 minutes to exit the building (people were stood on the steps to avoid being crushed). Upon exit there was a mele outside as other tourists complained to Thomas Cook. A lady was having a panic attack, a man was clutching his chest and another grabbed the rep by his throat and was screaming that he had lost his wife in the crowd and could not find her. Sammie-Jo the Thomas Cook rep organised transport back to the resort, she apologied and agreed that it was over full and told us to see her at 9am the following morning for a full refund. The following morning her Manager (who had approved the refund the previous night) refused the refund and would not even face us. I have lodged a complaint with Thomas Cook. They are bare faced liars who care nothing for the safety of their customers. Avoid... please... if there was a fire or fight in there Thomas Cook would have blood on their hands, you would not be able to get out. Terrible. Shocking. Greedy. Thomas Cook should be ashamed. The tiny part of the show I did see (I climbed up the side of some scaffolding for a few seconds to see what was happening on stage) was rubbish anyway. The free Michael Jackson King of Pop Tribute in our hotel was better!"

I had great fun there, the show was very good, it is what makes it worth going there in first place, most of the staff were very friendly, however everything else was a bit lacking. Overall I have been to far better night clubs (not in Playa del Carmen though). We got the VIP tickets with reserved table, when we got there we noticed that everybody had VIP tickets promising no queue. Apparently this can't happen as there is only one entrance so we were stuck in the VIP queue for ages while the normal one was going really fast. After an argument with the security guy we got in and surprise, surprise no table!!! We managed to find a bar which was 'reserved' - this got resolved by another argument and a few 1 dollar bills. The waiter was really good I must admit, however I would suggest that you give them the odd tip, really improves the service. They seem to sell VIP, Super VIP and Mega VIP tickets, therefore I would suggest that you ask a lot of questions with regard to what exactly is included before you pay anything. I saw a few people getting their money back and going home while we were waiting to get in.Enough about the tickets. The place is cramped, basically you can't get to the toilet (which is really clean) unless you are very close as it's a tinned sardines experience. People are constantly trying to move around probably to find some empty space which makes the problem even worse. I think that they overfill the place by at least 50%.The drinks are watered down as you might expect so unless you're underage or get drunk by a double whiskey, don't worry you'll be sober throughout the show. I usually don't attend night clubs which use plastic cups, it makes you feel as if you're drinking in the street, but after the initial problems with the entrance and the table this seemed fairly minor.Once you leave at about 3-4a.m. there are plenty of taxis to take you home."

The show itself was amazing and fun, the service was impeccable (I'd put a beer down with 1/3 left, look up seconds later to find a brand new one in its place. I swear I never even saw the server).

The show lasted for hours, with a tribute to the beetles, Elvis, Michael Jackson, madonna and rhianna it felt like you had travelled through the history of pop with some show tunes thrown in. Bizarre rope dangling, balloon throwing and lots of tickatape kept us whooping through the night.We paid extra for vip tickets and I was so glad we did. Not only did we get seats and tables but an excellent view of the stage and personal waiter. We drank far too much and the tequilla served straight into the mouth was perhaps a step too far.The night ended when a member of the group hit the multiple shots brick wall and had to be aided by security (you know who you are). By this point it was about 3am and at 40 something it was way past my bed time. Taxis were outside and we were still buzzing when we returned to the hotel.

Be warned they have a camera which if the light lands on you then you will be put on 2 big screens so everyone can see how badly you dance, don't worry you won't be the only ones!

You will have a spectacular night of trapeze artists being put on, amongst other shows and dances, it's a really good night! It's for people who love to drink, dance and have a good time, and it's also for people who love watching shows. It really is amazing! It can get pretty crowded in here though, as it does get really busy, so if you don't like crowded places and lots of people around you would steer clear.I would recommend just getting the normal express pass, do not go VIP unless you like to sit down a lot and not really be involved in the atmosphere. If you wanted be involved in the partying, this is where you need to be! Also a lot of ppl who went VIP whined, as they had seats on the ground floor (which was slightly tiered) but when express pass customers stood up they whined as they couldn't see because of all the people dancing etc. Some VIP's are also situated up on the balconies also, so they wouldn't have this problem, but I would still never go VIP to an event like this, too much fun to be missed in the express part if you do.We paid about \u00a345 each for our express passes, if you go VIP you will be doubling that price pp. You can receive the same type of service if you do not go VIP, all's ya have to do is tip your waiter who greets you at the beginning 100 pesos, he will fetch you your drinks for the rest of the night. Bargain for the service you receive.A word of advice, don't let the female's who work at coco bongo's (in the toilets) try to dry your hands, as they do this so you will tip them.Next time I do eventually go back to Mexico, I need to visit this place twice, it really is fantastic.

These were expensive, but it was worth it. The show was fantastic and our waiter was very attentive. Yes you should tip, but we did at the end and it didn't make any difference to his attentiveness throughout the night. Our seat wasn't brilliant - side view - but I definitely reccomend sitting down unless you're on a night out with a group. As a couple, this was perfect for us. It was a great night and I'd most definitely visit again."

If you stay at Allegro Playacar buy your tickets from Dian, she is awesome. This was my second time to the Playa Del Carmen Coco Bongo and it was awesome...VIP is worth it but I didnt find our section to be in the best spot though. Also the Cancun version of Coco Bongo is much bigger and better in my opinion. The show itself is amazing and the bartenders/waiters were really doing an amazing job. Maybe in a few years I will go back and check it out again, but I do recommend t to anybody who has never been. Quite and experience...more of a SHOW than a \"club\". :)"

It was defiantly a lot of fun.The atmosphere, the songs, the performances, the dancing the impersonations.All of it was definetly very very fun.I Don't mean to be a party pooperUnforgettably we had a bad experience that thank God didn't end up a lot worse then it could of. We let our guard down and let the very polite waiters bring us our drinks on trays (as people mentioned it is too packed to even move to head to the bar) by the middle of the night security guards kept shining torches on our drinks which I didn't know why. ( The only thing I could think of was someone must be having drugs near us) My husband started to feel very strange by the middle of the night and this was not a alcohol reaction we had hardly been drinking only vodka and cranberry. This was a very scary experience on our honeymoon and thankfully I wasn't affected and we got to our hotel safely. it just goes to show you cant trust anywhere even a sold out popular event.Just wanted to warn others to be very careful. After this happened i goggled other reviews and some things also came up on google about people drinks being spiked for their money etc.Considering what happened this is still a great attraction and worth the money paid."

I went with a group of girls and we bought our tickets from promoters at the resort at a discount. They were only regular tickets because VIP was sold out for the night by the time we bought them. YES we were shoved around but I still had the best time! The performers are EXCELLENT, lots of acrobats doing crazy stunts and the impersonators are not your regular lame street performers, they are really good and it felt just like watching the real thing! The music in between the shows was great too, I didn't hear a single song that I didn't like. The bartenders and busboys here are also very nice and friendly; even though we didn't have VIP they still brought us drinks and offered to help us take pictures, etc. And when we asked where the restrooms were, they would literally take our hand and lead us right there as it would have been impossible otherwise because the place is so jam packed.Overall it was an awesome night! Be prepared for lots of balloons and confetti!"

HIGHLY RECOMMEND the golden package unless you are someone who likes being squished in a crowd or dancing on the bar.that being said..the show was very very good. great music the drinks were flowing the waiters were extremely attentive. we had great seats on the second floor but not sure upstairs there was a bad seat. smoky from the show but they didnt allow cigarette smoking. advertised to start at 1030 but I am sure we didnt even get into the door til then so it was at least 1100only one stall in the ladies bathroom upstairs so there was a line at times but they had an attendant in there cleaning and making sure no one left any mess for the next person.beautiful costumes great dancers we stayed til around 330 then it seems like all the music was latin and we decided to leave but I highly recommend it if you are in playa and WE WERENT THE OLDEST ONES THERE :)"

We had heard horror stories about people prepaying for wristbands and waiting in line so long they give up and leave so we were pretty skeptical but we had a good guy working at our hotel and got in in about 10 minutes. We got the express pass which was $ 60 a person and included entry AND open bar. while youre filing in first thought is god I hope theres not a fire but they hand you drinks in line so you've got a drink and a shot by the time you are even in the bar area. They cram you in like sardines so forget about personal space. Think of the busiest dance floor you've ever tried to move through-that's the entire building. I was drinking my drinks as soon as I got them to avoid them spilling all over me for the zillionth time from people bumping into me. I was annoyed at first having drinks spilled all over me, but since I was drinking so quickly I got drunk pretty fast so quickly forgot about how sticky I was. they get tourist girls to go up on stage for a while and shake their booty then when they want them off they blow air from the floor to send there dress up marilyn monroe style and then the show begins. Very vegas and cirque du soleil styled. Dancers swinging from harnesses and silks, very entertaining. In between sets they have the tourist girls go up again and shake their booty. My bf found the drinks to be watered down (I hadn't noticed) and bought some drinks that weren't included. The service was great sending even have to go to the bar the staff brought the drinks to us which normally I'm paranoid and would not be cool with but none of us were drugged so seems pretty legit. Not that I would be the easiest target since our group of 4 consisted of 3 large men.. Also worth mentioning the service from the staff in the womans bathroom puts the bathrooms in bars at home put to shame. They open the door for you, wipe the seat and give you paper towel. And the bathrooms even after everyone is a mess is very clean!"

The experience alone was worth the $112.50USD each. We had a server by the name of Abel. He was amazing, and each time I needed the washroom he took me by the hand and escorted me there and was waiting at the stairs to escort me back. Our drinks and ice bucket were constantly topped up. Has anyone else had him as server? After seeing what we would have got for $55USD I'm very glad we opted out for it- it seemed way too crowded and even though it was all you could drink for $55 good luck struggling through the crowd for a drink! This is a must see \"night out\"!! I still think about that night and wish to go back!"

Coco Bongo is an excellent night out - great atmosphere and good entertainment. We paid for VIP seats which meant we had our own little table and waiter which was well worth the additional money. The tickets we had were all inclusive night - the money paid included drinks. We were on the second floor of the club and had a good view of all performing areas. Our waiter was excellent - once he knew what we were drinking we didn\u2019t have an empty glass all night. He brought additional drinks on occasions such as shots and bottles of water which was appreciated.The music in the club was brilliant \u2013 really got the night off to a good start. Everyone was in good spirits so lots of dancing. Then the show started \u2013 WOW! It was amazing! Very professional dancing, great sets and excellent to watch. They did different short shows to various backing tracks covering all decades and included sets themed to different movies (the Mask was obviously there, along with Batman, Moulin Rouge etc). You had the people on the stage, people on the bar and people zipping in from the roof \u2013 you didn\u2019t know where to look next!We booked through our Thomson Rep which included a coach to and from our hotel \u2013 Riu Playacar. After speaking to other holidaymakers I think we could have probably got slightly cheaper tickets direct from Coco Bonga or from the hotel entertainment staff however we were still impressed with the evening for the price we paid. Would definitely visit again next time in Mexico and can highly recommend to others!!"

All I can say is 2 out of 4 ain't bad!! Got there no problem but had to queue 3 times to actually get in. Our guide took us up 3 levels and as he went to leave I quizzed him about the promise of table and chairs. He then took us up another level where we got a bar stool and a ledge. Once it finished we waited over 45 minutes for our transport and got so fed up waiting we took a taxi back to our hotel. What I will say is the show is worth going for, however the drinks are so strong you can't drink them and there are only 2 toilets for all the boys AND girls!! Beware of the girls trying to give you shots......$5 dollars a pop but if you get from your server they are free.

Between parts of the planned show, patrons danced on the bar (and a select few made it to the stage) -- and everyone in the house seemed to be having a raucous, great time."

All have been incredible nights. Nothing like this though. The show started at 11:00 p.m. and went on without stoping until 3:00 a.m. and there was no way were leaving until it was over. If you are over 30 go the VIP route. Get yourself a table, tip your server (shout out to Aldo! The BEST) well and you won't want for anything all night. The regular admission is a sweaty wall-to-wall party, which looked like a blast but it's doubtful I would have lasted on my feet that long in heels. Speaking of heels, unlike Vegas, not neccessary. Definitely more casual which was refreshing. Confetti cannons, balloon drops, smoke, pyrotechnics, cirque-esque performances that span pop culture icons, bands and movies, a crazy good dj and a midget. It's dark, loud, tight quarters will be the BEST night of your vacation. We're 40 years old and wanted to keep going. Don't miss this. Seriously. Just go."

If you are afraid of being closed in and especially if there is a fire then do not go here, inside is wood, could easily go up in smoke.Our friends went to the one in PDC, he said the drinks were thick and you couldn't swallow them, it was very hot. They said the show was ok but more like drag queens. If you are young and you are not bothered by the dangers then you will enjoy it, but being a little bit older my safety comes first.If you really do want vegas shows go to vegas, this is nothing like it."

We booked VIP (Gold Member) through our Apple representative at our resort. The cost was $120 USD/pp. which included transportation to and from Coco Bongo. I would highly recommend paying for VIP, because it gives you a place to sit and set down your drink. The show was well worth the money. We saw impersonations of Michael Jackson, Madonna, Rihanna, Usher, Superman, and the Mask just to name a few. The show started at 11:30 pm and ended around 3:15 am; between set changes it is a dance club. The wait staff is very friendly and the bathrooms are very clean (there is even an attendant in them). The only thing that my husband and I did not like is the shot girls. They would come around, blow a whistle and try to get you to take a shot. The shots are not included in the open bar and are $5 USD/shot. I wouldn\u2019t have minded if they asked once, but every 10 minutes they were back and every time we turned them down. You think they would have remembered our faces and knew we weren\u2019t interested. That aside, Coco Bongo is a definitely must do if visiting Playa del Carmen."

For $65 we got a ride to and from our hotel and a private table with a waiter and non-stop drinks. Once we got there, JJ was actually able to squeeze us into VIP so we each got a bar stool along the top row. While the guests are mostly mid-20s, the experience caters to any age (ie. our group ranged from 28-55.)The show itself is unreal. So much going on that it is utterly impossible to get bored. MJ, Usher, Katy Perry, Rolling Stones, Moulin Rouge, Rhianna, Madonna, Elvis and tonnnnnnes more. Although others have mentioned the safety factor, I wouldn't let that deter you unless you are very claustrophobic - that might be an issue for you.As for the service, as long as you tip your waiter, you will not have to wait for drinks. I would also highly recommend that you book through someone who works for Coco Bongo. Jozaphat stayed with us the entire night from the time he picked us up at the hotel until we left the bar. He made sure that we were taken care of and were enjoying our night - I've never experienced this kind of service before. I would imagine that without him and Victor (our resort 'babysitter' - as he referred to himself haha) our night may not have been quite as enjoyable.To summarize, if you are able to get there, absolutely do it - make sure you are rested, get yourself a host (Jozaphat if you can!) and make sure you have comfortable shoes :)"

Yes, there's that also! We paid $65 each to have the \"direct bus\" (only stopped at our hotel and two others) with regular floor standing.If you know you're going to be standing wear something more comfortable than 5inch heels. Couple pointers for females- The middle bar on the floor in front of the stage offers women to dance on it- as the night goes on they put rails up so you dont fall on the bartenders. It does get hot in there but they send out gusts of cold winds and LOTS of oxygen gets pumped in all night long. If you plan to dance on the bar DO NOT wear a super flowy dress. It will end up around your neck! The bathrooms are great! They have cup holders inside the stall so you never have to leave your drink unattended! And the show is AMAZING!!

We really wanted to experience a great time for my husband's 40th birthday celebration but the Coco Bongo in Playa del Carmen was a complete disappointment and we had to leave after 15 minutes. First, our tour guide from the Barcelo Maya Beach Hotel assured us that the LONGEST LINE we ever stood in would only take 5 (Mexican) minutes as we were in the \"express line\" - this actually took more than 30 minutes. Once in side you were handed a cranberry and vodka to endure the remaining line up to security check which took another 15 minutes or so. The perfect way to describe the process would be how farm animals are corralled into a small space. Once inside, the place is so packed that you can't move and everyone is pushing you one way or the other. We tried to move up to another level only to be blocked by security who didn't tell us that it was a VIP area, he just stood in our way as we tried to pass him until he yelled at us and finally told us that it was a VIP area. Then we tried to go up another set of stairs to find some room to breath, only to be ushered back down by security since that area was too full. The only place we could stand was on the main level which was so jam packed that you barely lift your arm to take a sip of your now warm drink, never mind trying to order a second one for the \"all inclusive\" option we paid for. The place made us all feel unsafe because if there was ever a fire, the place would burn down with many people in it. We would never be allowed that many people into an establishment in Canada. We paid $70 USD per person for one drink and 15 minutes of show before the four of us left because we couldn't even see the stage and had to pay our own way back to the hotel for another $23 since our bus wasn't leaving until 2:00 a.m. This might be a fun place for 18 year olds that enjoy crowded places for partying but for anyone else, forget it! The Coco Bongo reps at the hotel should be explaining what to expect so people can choose if they are okay with feeling like cattle or not. I've heard that the Cancun location is bigger and it might be better but we made sure to tell anyone thinking about the Playa del Carmen one to save their money and time. When I told the Coco Bongo staff at the hotel about our experience, all they could say was \"sorry\". No offer of a discount or our money back so we just chalked it up to our annual Mexico rip off - last year it was a Cozumel excursion that I never got around to writing about. If you want to do something really fun, go to Xplor Adventure Park. We've been there twice and would go again!"

They had pre-poured drinks available at a few stops once inside heading towards the party, which was a relief cause we had waited over an hour to get in. However once inside there was nowhere to stand. We did have an employee lead us up a few levels promising a better view, but once up there, there was nowhere to go. The show started and none of us could see a thing (8 people), you couldn't even rest and just drink in one spot cause you were constantly getting whistled at to get out of the way by the waiters or being shoved by other customers. I also started to get nervous about a fire, or something happening that would require evacuation, cause there were so many people packed into this vertical space on every level and no exits! It was monumentally disappointing, cause my husband and I paid over 100 dollars to go and we desperately wanted to leave after an hour. We took a cab back to our resort with another couple in our group. A lot of people did this and it thinned out the crowd, so for our friends that stayed, they actually got a view after a few hours and enjoyed the remainder of the show. I feel like it was such a waste of money, a stupid spectacle, and a deliberate money grab. Don't waste your money!"

You are so packed in there that if a fire were to break out, you better hope you're at a table close to the exit or that is your death sentence. There is ONE exit to this place, it's set up terrible.2. The waiters will just bring you whatever drinks they can get on their tray and they will ASK you for tips even if you've already tipped the time before! All of the above complaints could be actually looked over for me, because hey, I was in college, I've been in college, I've been in packed bars, with bad drinks, however, my 3rd and biggest complaint will keep us from ever visiting a CoCo bongo again, I will be sure to make sure all our friends and family will never visit any of these establishments again.I went to CoCo Bongo with my Husband, and another couple, who happen to be gay and another friendl, so the 5 of us. We had a nice table close to the bar and in front of the stage for the shows. About 2:30am, 4 security guards walked up to our table with a flashlight, flashed it at my three friends and said they needed to go with them. After lots of confused looks around each other, I urged them to go with them and my husband and I followed after. Luckily our one friend spoke fluent Spanish and was able to try and talk to the guards, who at this point, 7 of them surrounded our group of 5 (the most non-violent group you could have!) It was first believed that we were kicked out because one of my friends appeared to be sleeping (impossible as we were all standing) or too drunk because we asked for bottles of water (so did the surrounding groups). Finally, after we physically left the building and were outside, our friend fought them enough and found that we were indeed kicked out because our friends are gay and were dancing. They claimed to be a \"family\" environment and that someone complained about their dancing - mind you, let me please be clear they were doing no more than dancing side to side to the music. How is the fact that they're gay and their dancing was any more \"offensive\" than the girls in short dresses and skirts dancing on the bar, or, oh wait, the girls they have dancing up on the stage and them blowing AIR up their skirts?! They discriminated against my friends and I urge you all to think twice before visiting this club!"

Basically alot of imitators (Elvis, lady gaga), dancers etc.We bought the standard entrance tickets, came in early and talked to a waiter that provided us with seats on the middle floor with good overview of the place.The show is for 2-3 hrs and the drinks are good, somewhat strong. After the show the place turns in to a club with good music."

The first time the ticket sales guy at our hotel guaranteed us a great view, private area & table etc but didnt deliver. We were on the floor right next to the entrance. As others have noted they really pack the people in and its shoulder to shoulder. If you're by the door, you cant see much once they let people start dancing on the bar. Our second time, a week later, was much better. The fellow selling tickets was part of the hotels entertainment crew. We let him know we wanted to go but would hold him accountable for our seating (or standing position). This time we were on the second floor looking down at the floor and directly across from the stage. Alex came through and we were able to enjoy the show.The show itself was very loud and fairly long. It's a lot of dancing & lip sync to music videos with dancers sometimes suspened by cables or performing acrobatics somewhat similar to Cirque du Soliel. Overall very entertaining.  My tip is only buy tickets from someone you can hold accountable for your seating. Otherwise you'll be stuck on floor grinding & wreething with a mass of people - unless thats your thing of course!"

We had priority tickets however had to join a long queue, the drinks they had I had not heard of and the place was so busy it was difficult to see what was going on. We were also paranoid about how to get out of the bar if something happened, as there only seemed to be exits on the ground floor. This is even more of a concern since the fire in Brazil. Needless to say we made quite a swift exit. We have since heard that the one in Cancun is much bigger and better, so if you fancy it, I would try and go to the Cancun one."

The disaster in Brazil is making it imperative for me to comment again. The Playa nightclub is a 5 story wood shanty, overcrowded with patrons. It would be the exact same scenario as the disaster in Brazil. Cocobongo's oversells tickets for the space provided and there are only 2 exits for hundreds of patrons. It was a nightmare trying to get out of the club when there was no fire. In the U.S. this place would not be allowed to operate. My heart goes out to those in Brazil who were injured and those who have lost loved ones. If you want that kind of show, Vegas is a much safer bet."

It is more of a night club for drunk 20 year olds. It has a bit of characters swinging around on bungie type cords, but that is a small part of the show. Most of it is dancers or music video screen projection and lip sync singing. Not much different than shows at resort. Also audience (young girls in short skirts) dancing on stage and girls getting their skirts shot up by an air blast. Service for drinks was surprisingly good, but whistle blowing in ear every five minutes for $ shots was annoying. If you are not in front row on one of the upper levels you will not have a good view of main floor. We had to stand for the entire show from 11:30 until 3:30. Maybe have an earlier show some nights? Mixed washrooms with 2 stalls and lots of drunks was really gross."

Went with my hubby and three other couples we met at our resort so we were a little bit of a group which I think is the only way to go. Apparently Saturdays are the best days to go (accordig to reps) however, we went on a Friday. Paid $55 through Sunwing for the basic ticket which includes drinks, transportation, and admission on the main floor. I'd have to say being on the floor was the most live BUT it was at times extremely crowded...like rubbing up against the four people on each or your sides. Sort of gross at times but it is what it is at this place. Our bus picked us up at 10:30 for about a 15-20 minute drive from the Princess resort. Got dropped off at the local bus terminal at which point the entire bus gets off and walks through the streets (a tad scary...but I guess safe) for about 3 blocks. Your tour rep is with you at this point so its not so bad. When you get there you'll know it. There is a HUGE Covo Bongo sign, police cars parked everywhere and just hoards of people standing around the place. There was no line up. Our rep took us directly into the place, got our wristbands for us and walked us right up to our 'area' on the floor.Once in there, no way you cannot be impressed. The place is like a stadium with levels of standing areas and a huge stage which is elevated. Shows are amazing. Just amazing. Effects are awesome. Flashing lights, blowing air (like hair flies back kind of pressure), confetti and even glow sticks being tossed out into the crowd and oversized balloons from the ceiling. Just amazing.Safety tips: Go to the bathroom in packs. Watch your drinks. If you put it down, don't pick it back up. Drinks are free for goodness sake. Just get another one from the bar. We heard of some guy putting things in some drinks. Didn't see it ourselves and don't know what exactly he was doing but either way.... Dance on the bar if you can. Go up on stage and dance for the place. Probably experiences you will not ever forget. We left at 3:15 which is when we were told to meet at the front. Our rep was there but just told us to make out way back to the bus...on our own. This may not be the safest idea considering people are super drunk at this point and may not know their way back to the bus so I think this is when going as a group helps...someone always sober enough to know what's going on. Common sense stuff. Made it safely back to our resort by around 3:45-4 ish and completely buzzing with excitement still.Would I go again? Absolutely!!"

Fantastic show and really keeps you entertained throughout. All adult age groups catered for regarding music, from 50's right through to today's rap (an awful lot of that inbetween show stopping stage action) but for the most part highly enjoyable and watching the youngsters having a great time.

We entered with our wristbands and was hit by the heat and sweatyness of the place! When i say people are packed in here like sardines i am not joking. Health & Safety in the UK would have had a field day. This was disgustingly crammed. You could barely squeeze through people as they were squashed against the next person!.Eventually after climbing over fallen people we went upstairs to our balcony. This was such a relief as there was just a few of us up here and had a fantastic view of the stage!. Our own toilet and bar service.The waiters were top notch, drinks were filled at all times and i have never seen service like it when a drink was spilled. They were moping, drying and polishing! Amazing.The show is fantastic but we were scared to go back into the sardines and leave. The sight at people getting crushed on the floor was enough to scare us away.An amazing experience and definately worth if ONLY IF YOU THOMAS COOK IT!!!!!"

All night I probably spent no more than \u00a310 in tips which seems alot for a night out but you wont have to move from your dance spot, every time the waiter sees your glass empteing he's put another one in your hand. he even escorted the wife to the toilet as it on the other side of the small floor but without his help would have took her 20 mins and he gave us a bottle of water each when the lights went on at the end of the night to take away.

We decided to venture out on one of our last nights in Playa, and from all the promoters running rampant in our resort, we felt Coco Bongo was the place to check out. The bus picked us up from our resort at 11:30 and we headed to the nightclub. When we arrived, we were escorted to the \"VIP section\" - some cocktail table that accommodated a couple of drinks and maybe 3 people to stand around. Nowhere to sit, even though we paid premium price to be there. The show started, and yes - it was spectacular. Like nothing you'd find at home. It went from the show, to a full dance club experience. The waiters would guide you up onto the bar, and you'd dance and have a great time. The entertainment was amazing - from full cabaret to Cirque du Soleil type of air acrobatics. Just stunning. Around 3am - right when patrons are good and drunk - is when you get taken advantage of. I don't know whether it was the wait staff or locals hanging around for an easy target, but my purse got swiped right from under my nose. Yes, I'm the idiot for not holding on to it, and it can happen anywhere. But when we called the next day, all they had in the lost and found was a belt. Seriously?? When have you ever gone to a club - or even a restaurant for that matter - where the only thing in the lost and found was a measly belt. Clearly if it WAS turned in, the staff had their pick and choose of what they got to take home for the night. Anyway, it was a great experience overall I guess, but just be VERY careful and keep a watchful eye. Mexico is clearly corrupt - it doesn't take a genius to figure that out - so watch your possessions, watch your back and be wary of the shooter girls pouring booze down your throat."

The first time we were on the floor, packed liked sardines, but the party atmosphere was the best. The show from the floor was at times hard to see, but being right in the middle of the show and action was amazing. The acrobats and performers were close enough to touch, and flying right over our heads at times. The second time we paid the extra charge, and got seated on the second level. The view was better to see the show, but it lacked the nightclub party feel a little bit. We were amazed at the staff and security. Everything ran like a well oiled machine. The dancers are beautiful and the performers are very talented. The bathrooms had attendants. They were clean and safe. We were given shots before even entering the door, and were never without a drink. Even after partying all night long, we never felt tired. They continually pump in cool fresh air, so it was always a pleasant temperature. It is like the best nightclub experience, dance party, and cirque du soleil all mixed together. If you are planning a trip to Cancun or Playa del carmen, you have to include Coco Bongo. If you didn't, it would be like going to Toronto and not seeing Niagra Falls."

As soon as you walk in their handing you shots and drinks before you even go through security....what club does that? The vibe and energy is awesome and the lights, music , and special effects are unreal. We bought our tickets through our hotel and I highly recommend that because they put you in a VIP section with your own personal waiter. The ticket price includes all you can drink. We went their with 15 friends and everybody had an amazing time. It's a must see words cannot explain how talented the performers are and how awesome everything is in there!"

You couldn't get show tickets and drink all night for that price in Canada so based on that we didn't think it was overpriced for the experience.

At the end of each 'act' there is flying confetti, balloons and flashing lights. While you're dancing to the music, you have people flying above you on a trapeze.

I think we stayed for almost three hours and left before the show was really finished (1:30 or 2am) but the energy and entertainment was outstanding! Line up early if you're not getting a VIP table to get a good place to stand. You may not get the full attention of the wait staff if you're not buying a bottle but like I said, if you're not just trying to get your money's worth in alcohol and just use your time to enjoy the show and bop around in between the skits you will NOT regret it!

We lined up at 11.00 in a \"VIP\" line & got our armbands. Finally let in at 11.45 pm .We were guided up several sets of stairs to the top balcony. Here we stood leaning on a rail about 4\" wide, just wide enough to put a drink on. I've had more room at soccer matches in the UK in the old days when we had to stand in terraces. You had to twist & move slowly to pick up a drink, it was that tight for room.Drinks were included ,the caveat being the waiter could hardly get through the crush of people on the stairs ,no matter what we tipped him. We had to stand at a slight angle because the crush of people was so intense .Then they let even more people in to stand behind us .These seemed like locals who paid less.The show is spectacular & equivalent to cirque soleil . However our misery was compounded by watching the people below us & on the floor having fun, dancing & drinking at their tables.Like many who gave poor reviews we looked for fire exists , but these seemed to be the way we came in. Its no smoking, but way up at top & back locals were ignoring this & lighting up. The place was obviously way over capacity After 90 minutes we left & found a nice bar with live music.My suggestion is to some research , go on a quieter night & pay more for VIP gold , super enhanced ,whatever they call it to get a table , elbow room & a chance of getting out alive if there is a fire."

We paid 750pesos each to get in. Get there a little early because the line gets pretty big. My only recommendation would be find a waiter and tell him that you will tip him well if he takes care of you. I tipped him maybe $10US the whole night and had great service! Drinks kept coming and coming all night long. Once you're in drinks are included, but that little bit of extra money makes your evening much more enjoyable. If you can stay on the main floor near the bar and sit up on the stairs on the either the left or right side of the main bar. Great view, lots to see, great music and just an overall really fun night. All ages will have a good time. You can dance if you want to, but it's really more about the great show that they put on.

We paid \u00a375 each for the experience & really wish we hadn't bothered. We were advised by our rep that Monday nights are quietier - that is not the case. We chose to make our own way into PDC to have a meal & some drinks which was very enjoyable. Arriving at the club it was a chaotic scene with various queues which was all very confusing. We eventually managed to get into the club but again it was confusing where we got our wrist bands from. Once inside it was heaving & I wouldnt recommend it for the claustrophobic type. The club is laid out like an Opera house so the only way to go is up, all the time looking for the nearest fire exit because if anything kicked off in there, well, you'd never survive! The only way you can see anything is if you're standing looking over the balcony, and that is where it all went wrong for me. Whilst my partner was queuing for the toilet (we're talking 10 fellas in a queue for 1 toilet!!) I asked a young blonde girl if I could slip in next to her so I could see the show. There was clearly plenty of room & although she seemed reluctant she moved an inch to the side. Now, anyone whos been to this place before knows it gets rammed in there so she probably went into overdrive later in the evening. Anyway, partner still queuing for the loo, this girl decides she really doesn't like me next to her. She turns to me & tells me I'm making her feel uncomfortable & to go away as she was there first. Typical playground spoilt brat. I politely tell her I was just there like her to have fun, see the show & I'd paid the same as she had. So then she starts banging into me, pushes me into the girl next to me on the other side. To which she encourages this other girl to have a go at me. I gave up & moved away, not before telling her boyfriend what a nasty horrid girlfriend he had, but for some reason I think he probably knows that already :0) Anyway, we managed to find a spot at the top where the people seemed a bit more friendlier. Then it turned into the \"let's all laugh at the dwarf dressed up as a clown show\" so we left! I'm sure if we had gone in a group, as we had done before & had strong bladders, it probably would have been a better experience. Alas for us, well we should have stayed in that restaurant!!"

If you come to Playa del Carmen to enjoy the sun, surf and sky but feel the need to get your party on, then Coco Bongo might be the place for you.I see that most recent reviews for this place give it top marks. For me it was a bust but I perhaps went into it with different expectations.This was one of the excursions organized by our Transat tour rep. It's the largest, most popular night venue in downtown Playa del Carmen. Every night from 11:30 pm to 2 am, there is a 'live' show which is supposedly a 'must see' event.We arrived about an hour before the show time start of 11:30 pm. There was a bit of milling about in the lineup for about 20 minutes then we were allowed inside.At the door everyone was searched with a thorough pat down. My wife had to allow her handbag to be searched, and she wasn't allowed to take her Advil into the club. She had to leave those at the check-in for later pickup. So you can be reasonably confident that there are no weapons or drugs in the club.To get us into the party mode by staff, we were given a tequila shot and a mixed drink before we were even in the club.From the description, I expected a cross between some sort of Vegas lounge and a dance club. And that was the biggest problem with the club for me. It tries to be both and, as a result, does neither really well. The club isn't laid out to be dance friendly. There isn't a dedicated dance floor to speak of. Instead it's more of an opera house layout. There's a main floor with lots of closely packed tables. In the middle of the floor is a small centre stage. A higher main stage lines the back wall, and two levels of narrow balconies ring three sides of the club and overlook all of this.And boy, do they pack the people in there! There is no way in Canada or the US that they would be allowed to pack this many people into a night club. If a fire ever broke out in this club, lots of people would die, no doubt about it.All of our group afterward admitted that one of the first things each of us did when we got into the club was to quickly figure out where the fire exits were and make sure we were near one.And if you lose the person you are with, good luck finding them again in the darkness and mass of people milling about it.We were led to our reserved section in one of the balconies off to one side. It was packed with people and there is no seating in the balconies. Everyone has to stand.The show itself started at 11:30 pm. Til then we had to watch a half-dozen show girls on the two stages. They were all smiles, but they didn't do much other than shuffle from one foot to the other in time to some bland music being strung together by the in-house DJ.And how was the show itself, once it started?Kinda meh. It mostly consisted of club music and videos projected onto two screens lowered down onto the main stage. Periodically, the screens lift up and we were treated to imitators of the Beatles, Elvis, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Queen, etc... They sort of lip synced to the songs, and moved in imitation of the originals with varying degrees of success. On the screen behind them videos played of the originals and all it did was remind me of how much better the originals were.Occasionally, some of the acts did some interesting wire work and floated off the stage and over the crowd below. And, at regular intervals, clouds of string balloons, confetti and streamers were fired off over the crowd to great roars of approval from the audience.For me though too much of the act was the video filler between the acts. As the music and liquor flow throughout the night, people started to dance... sorta. With no dance floor and little room in the aisles, people could only bounce and flail about in their confined space and obscure views of the show for the people in the back.I was very impressed with the patience and talents of the serving staff who had to navigate through this chaotic throng of people.There are some pluses...As I mentioned previously there was no smoking in the club although I thought I was offered a cigar by the staff at one point.The lineups for the mixed washrooms were very quick. The washroom attendant did a bang-up job of keeping everything orderly and clean within so we tipped her accordingly.Booze is free, or at least the simple drinks and beer that we were drinking was free.The rest of our group seemed to enjoy it, but most of them were pretty pickled from the free booze by the end of the night. Perhaps that's the way to best enjoy it."

The driver who dropped us off was exactly where he said he would meet us at the end of the night and took us back to our resort. We would definitley recommend this to our friends and are planning on going again on our next trip!We did think to check for emergency exits after reading some reviews and found two exit signs close to where we were sitting with arrows pointing towards eachother but no visable door to the outside between...not sure if there was a hidden door or what but if that is a concern just ask your server when you arrive and they will let you know where the exits are."

We went to Coco Bongos and I'm not young any more but used to enjoy clubs and I like shows but not a real enthusiast like my fiance. We paid a bit extra and booked the VIP tickets. This was worth it sooo much. We got picked up in resort at about 2200 and on the coach given tequilla. When we got to Playa Del Carmen we were taken by the Bongos rep to the que and were given VIP bracelets. In the que we were given a large vodka and cranberry and then in the next part of the que waiting to go through security were given another tequilla. We were then introduced to our personal barman who said i'll be looking after your balcony tonight. There was us (group of 8) and 2 other groups of similar size on our part of the balcony and the barman said anything you want drinks wise let me know by putting your hand up and i'll get it. I asked for a couple of beers and promptly got handed a bucket of corona, coors light and other beers. My fiance asked for vodka cranberry and her glass would be refilled without asking all night with branded drinks. Shots, beers, cocktails, spirits all night as much as you want and even a complimentary bottle of water at the end. That was the service, EXCELLENT. As for the show, OMG it was awesome. It was like a mixture of a show come night club come tribute to music, film and theatre. Everything from rock to dance, caberet to blockbuster movies, reggae to r n b. Tributes to the beatles, Beyonce, Michael Jackson, Meatloaf, Bon Jovi, Moulin Rouge, Men in black, Spiderman, Tron, Katy Perry and sooooo much more. In between the acts and stuff there was club like music, dance n trance and club classics with amazing light shows and big screens and the best effects i've seen in a club. All i can say is if there's one thing you do whilst in Mexico go to Coco Bongos on the VIP experience. Give up the following day as you'll be as rough as you've ever felt but what a great night with everyone coming out blown away."

My husband and I recently went to this place, and we hated it, left early , and boy was it hard to get out of the place, I was very close to tears it was like a nightmare trying to find the exit, despite paying for VIP we was not allowed to slip out of the exit we at last found,neither was another very distraught couple also trying to get out ! We were directed to an exit in the corner ,to get to that you had to battle your way through hundreds of people packed so tightly they could hardly move in any way. It was impossible we tried to do as we were instructed, panic was setting in for me , we had to go back to the security man on the exit we previously found as I started to feel very unwell and was by then in tears, he reluctantly let us out , have never been so relieved to get out of somewhere in my life ! Obviously the Mexicans don't have the same fire regulations as the UK, but I couldn't see any signs at all in the area we were in the V I P area, or anywhere for that matter, and the place had far too many people in there, they have lots of electrical equipment in ther going at full pelt, if a fire broke out, in my opinion many people would loose there lives, you can't see the exits in a bit of light so no chance if there was smoke, people would be crushed in the panic. The drinks I had we're not good , I only had two, very weak better at the hotel we were staying at. And no the show was to us was disappointing, BUT that's not why I'm writing this, it's the lack of fire regulations in this place, and concern at the amount of people they pack into the place, making money comes before people's safety ! AVOID !!!!"

The shows are really great and the music was fantastic. I'm not sure about how much it would cost to pay an entrance fee and for your drinks individually, but I think that the VIP package is money well spent. Obviously it is more than a club with all the tribute acts and musical pieces. Unless you don't intend to drink-go for this package. Would go back in a heartbeat!"

You can choose to party downstairs to stay upstairs, you will need to stand for the show in order to see the acts but there are seats available.Definately a night out for a group of you thats very different from the bars etc."

We swam in the freshwater cenotes under ground (very cool - snorkeling by flashlight and enjoying the cool freshwater). We went zip-lining through the jungle (and into a water landing in a cave) and had a really delicious authentic meal. The truck ride through the jungle seemed a little silly, but it was a small part of the day. Oh yes, we repelled into one of the cenotes - a very short trip, but still cool.

Also to go on a Friday or Saturday night in an extra \u00a37 or $10 each. We tried to save some money so we could go on other trips and were originally going to go VIP on a Saturday night but saved \u00a352 each by going on a Wednesday night an just purchased a standard ticket with drinks included. We were a little concerned with not going to Coco Bongo's at the weekend as we thought it might be really quite, but we had nothing to worry about, in fact we are so glad we didn't pay the additional \u00a37/$10 each as the place was so busy.From the outside the building looks very small, there are different queue, but your travel rep will direct you to the correct line. As we purchased a standard ticket you get to queue jump, thank god for this as the queue outside is huge. You are given a shot of tequila at the main door, another downstairs and another inside the main area, doesn't taste the best but it's free so what the hell! lolOnce inside the main door it takes about 15 minutes then to get to the main area, long queues inside but you get through them very quickly. This is down to the security checks, metal detector machine and you also get checked, pockets, legs, top half etc. Didn't have any problems with that and it's a little intimidating at first, but would rather they checked everybody that comes in then don't.The security will also checked you for phones, camera's and camcorders, no camcorders or filming in the premises. I had a camcorder that looked like mobile phone so no problem getting it in. You are then checked another two times once you get through security that you have purchased a ticket.Once you get through all that then the show and party begins. You are greeted and asked if you would like a drink. All the brand names behind the bar as well as all the local Mexican brands. If you want brand names to drink the you need to pay for these, about $4-$5 for your brand names. But we stuck to the cheap brands as they were free.The place is very small compared to the Coco Bongo's in Cancun which holds over 10,000 people, the one in Playa holds about 1.500 but the atmosphere is still amazing and everyone is up for a good time.The age group in Coco's ranges from 18 right up to 60+, all different ages enjoying themselves. It's not a night club, it's one big show with breaks between each act. When each act as finished they put the party music on and you have a dance to one or two songs then the shows come back on. When the shows are not on there is glitter that drops from the ceiling, paper, fireworks and people are handed long thin balloon's to wave around to the music. Fantastic atmosphere and everybody is singing, dancing and smiling.The place gets really busy and can be very difficult to find a good spot were people are not brushing past you all the time or where you have to keep moving. Can get very frustrating but once you find your spot it's brilliant.We didn't go VIP to try and save money for other trips but got the same treatment as the VIP's if not better, BIG TIP if you are not VIP, when the waiter walks past you, ask for your drinks and tip him $1, when he comes back tip him another $1 bill and mention to him if he keeps coming back to you, you will look after him. The waiter came back to us within 10 minutes and ask if we wanted more drinks, again we did the same thing and said we would give him 200 pesos at the end of the night. We did not have to go to the bar and get one single drink, we were getting drinks all night every 10 minutes and the measures were huge. So we got the same service if not better then the VIP. So we saved \u00a390 or $120, and all it cost us was an extra \u00a312.50 or $20 in tips to get fantastic service and make a new Mexican friend. We danced with him and had talk, thank you. I'm not sure but if you booked VIP i think you get the brand names, but once you have had a few, they all taste the same! lolEverybody is really friendly, we met loads of different people from Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Canada, England etc. We got picked up from our hotel at 10pm and arrived at the club at 11pm and were picked up at 3.30, Coco closes at 4pm.If you go here you will have great time and it's like nothing you have seen before, well worth going. PS security told us no filming or photographs, but we saw people doing the both all night and they were not hiding the fact, so we just did the same and got some great, photo's and recording that we can look back on fondly.Go go go go, you want be disappointed."

            "review": "This Place is Amazballs. If your in mexico (Playa del Carmen or Cancun) this is a must see its large Nightclub come caberet ! If you buy it as trip from your travel rep then go VIP if its offered its well worth it, If your going yourself get there early as you'll be standing and you want a good spot for the shows and will need to pay for your drinks(not sure about there cost).If you VIP it you'll be picked up by coach around 10pm and taken to the club in Playa del Carmen shown to the vip entrance and provided a wrist band then you'll be shown up a set of stairs (steep) and seated around a table or two depending on how many of you there are.Once seated the only time you'll need to move is to dance, smoke or go to the loo. Your waiter or busboy as they call them (ours was Jorge) will ask you what you would like to drink then he will sort your drinks. (I suggest that if you tip the bus boy on your third drink just 100 peso's (\u00a35) your glasses will never be empty and additional shots will be brought to your table.The show is amazing and very varied it goes from the Beatles, Beyonce, Madonna, Elvis and Micheal Jackson they also have loads of ribbon acrobats in the centre of the club they also do movie related acrobatics like MIB, Spiderman. During the brakes they play music videos on the big screen so your never really left un entertained. There are photo oppertunitys for you with some of the characters as they come round the club and they are reasonable priced.The only down side to this place is the stairs to the seated area once the show starts the stairs fill with people and it makes it very difficult to get to and fro from the toilet as you have to squeeze past them all not overlly safe but a small slur to an Amazing night !Dont expect an early night we left there at 3:30am to getn the coach home and finally arrived back at our hotel for 5am.Well worth the \u00a370 a must seeeeeeeeeeeeeee !!!!!!!!!!!!!!X:@)"

The show was very enjoyable and the atmosphere was electric. I was impressed at how everyone become so involved with so much audience participation - which made for a wonderful party atmosphere. The price included unlimited drinks which were served by an attentive waiter, but they were either too strong or oversweet. The daiquiries were not made with real fruit but a synthetic substitute. However, the drinks kept coming and the shots were quite nice. You do need to come here for the experience."

We booked to go to Coco Bongo through our Thomson tour rep who recommended we visit Puerto del Carmen rather than Cancun as its better laid out for a good view, she warned us it would be busy and to arrive early to ensure a good seat allocation (with VIP tickets). We were not entirely sure what to expect but hoped for a good show given that it's owned by Jim Carey! We were not disappointed in the slightest, in fact the whole experience exceeded our expectations, it was thoroughly entertaining and the staff looked after us throughout the night - I would recommend Coco Bongo in a heartbeat and would go back if we visit Mexico again.We read some negative reviews before we went but I have to say, as long as you arrive around 10.15pm you'll be allocated a good spot. The drinks just keep coming and they definitely contain alcohol so I'm not sure what that complaint was about...All in all if you're looking for a party atmosphere with plenty to see, this is the place to go!"

We had an amazing night and at times were mesmerised by the different acts.Prior to the show beginning there was a DJ playing some really modern dance style music, but then the actual show kicked off with the Beatles, then on to Queen, Lady Gaga, Madonna, Michael Jackson, a spider man dual in the air with a baddy and so many more I could mention! The performances, lights, streamers, acrobats and music made it such a unique experience.We arrived at 10.20 on the advice of our rep and paid for the VIP ticket as the seating included is on a first come first served basis up in the balcony area. We had no issues in getting a seat for the night arriving at this time. Our ticket included all of our drinks which were delivered by waiter service to our seats and were branded spirits and bottled beer - we were never without a drink. The toilets were immaculate as a poor toilet attendant cleaned them after every use. We got a taxi from our hotel to the club and I would recommend this as we stayed until 3am - much later than we had planned and later than the organised transport would have returned."

Not only were they so disrespectful to us but they were also extremely disrespectful to our representative who was trying to help us out. We were also told that four of the girls would have got in no problem but because two of us are shorter we clearly could not be legal (BTW the two shorter one happen to be the oldest in the group you idiots) .

If you are a smoker tell your \"handler\" there appeared to be only 1 section that had access to the smoking section outside.Once the show started it was now stop -- great time.. if you get the VIP- you will have a waiter that will get drinks for you.. never had a empty glass all night..The environment does not appear to be disability friendly nor will this environment appeal to anyone with claustrophobiaEnjoy"

We're so glad we did as some friends from our hotel didn't buy the VIP passes and they said they really wished they'd been up on the higher level with us. They got neck ache and hardly got any drinks at all. We bought our tickets from the Coco Bongo booth at the hotel swimming pool and again we're really glad we did this rather than going with Thomsons on their bar crawl as we wouldn't have seen the whole show then. Neither would I have wanted to buy our tickets through the Thomson reps at the hotel and make our own arrangements to get to/from Playa Del Carmen by taxi on our own as the reps suggested. The back streets of PDC at night isn't the best place to be if you're a tourist.We were collected from our hotel at 10.30 pm by Coco Bongo staff and driven to Playa Del Carmen by mini bus (return transport all included in the price of the tickets) When we arrived in Playa Del Carmen we were then taken to the front of the queue and with our VIP tickets we were inside straight away. Once we'd had the bag check we were inside and escorted straight through the crowds inside club and up to a higher level where we were given front row seats and our own table. We had our own waiter for the whole night who kept our drinks flowing in abundance - whatever we asked for he served us immediately. We had a brilliant view of the stage and the floor below. The waiters and security staff were constantly checking everywhere to ensure nobody was in any danger. We had huge respect for how hard all the staff worked throughout the night. They were also keeping a sharp eye for drugs of any type and to ensure nobody was smoking. There were dedicated VIP toilets which were very clean and well managed.The show was spectacular. I can't praise it highly enough. I loved the way it was so three dimensional; by this I mean it wasn't just on the stage, but it was all around, in the air and there was always something new and exciting happening. The best acts for me were Tron and Spiderman, but having said that nothing was really poor or disappointing. The show finished at about 3.30 am and we left the club shortly before 4 am to find our mini bus home. It was waiting exactly where the driver had told us it would be when he dropped us off earlier and once everyone was on board we set off back to our hotel in Akumal getting back about 4.30 am. A totally brilliant night and we thought great value.Yes, it's very crowded in there and yes, I couldn't help thinking how dreadful it would be if there were a fire, but I'm so glad we went and it was a fantastic way to celebrate my birthday. It's an experience I won't forget and nor do I want to."

We have been to and LOVED Coco Bongo in Cancun. Compared to the original, we both have to say that this was not nearly as good. We did the VIP, which was good but not worth the $120 per person price. The show was good for the most part, but the smaller venue really diminishes the experience. Choreography for some numbers was less than stellar. We saw their \"Broadway\" show. My daughter and her bf saw the same show in Cancun the week before. In comparing notes, the same numbers my husband and I were rolling our eyes at, namely Masquerade from Phantom and the Chicago numbers were performed extremely well at the Original Coco Bongo in Cancun! We were SO disappointed and felt ripped off. If you've never been to Coco Bongo in Cancun, you'll probably enjoy it. If you have, don't waste your money at the one in Playa del Carmen!

I really didn't know much about the tickets other than reading reviews of people saying get the VIP because you get drinks delivered to you. I thought I didn't need VIP because I was staying at a resort where top shelf liquor was included therefore I wasn't going to Coco Bongo to drink. So I bought two of the cheapest available tickets, 1300 pesos / $100 USD for two. Even the cheapest ticket includes open bar. We were not sure what day we were going, either Wednesday or Thursday, but the guy told us we didn't need to know what day other than it wouldn't be good on Friday or Saturday (maybe other days too) when the prices are a little more. The guy seemed a little sketchy because I got a receipt while my boyfriend got a wristband.When we arrived at Coco Bongo there were two lines of people, regular and fast line. We got the in \"fast line,\" got up to the bouncer and was told we were in the wrong line. We then got in the regular line which seemed like the line for the locals, not many people were in this line. Once the \"fast line\" died down another bus of people kept coming and they kept going in, but the regular line was just ignored like it didn't exist. After seeing people keep coming and coming and us not moving, who knows how long we would have been standing outside, I went to a woman at the information booth and asked her if I could pay extra to get in the fast line. She agreed and I got my boyfriend out of the regular line. She took us through to the ticket booth, we paid $15 USD and were finally in.The place was packed! They stick as many people as they can in there which is why the tickets we got were good for any of the non-peak days. I would hate to see this place have a fire because everyone would be dead. I tried to enjoy the show while being bumped and pushed. The acts were excellent, I just wish I could have enjoyed them more by not being bumped into and having someone put their big gut right onto my back! Too close for my comfort. I kept near the exit / back bar and then when I asked the security guard where the bathroom was he told me it was on the other side of the crowd. I didn't bother going to the bathroom because I didn't feel like squeezing my way there and back.I would NOT recommend Coco Bongo for all ages like many reviews state. I could not see my parents who are in their fifties enjoying this. If you can't stand top 40 music, this is not the place for you. This is a night club too, so if you're easily offended by a twenty something girl with a dress with no panties showing her privates because she was dancing on the balcony and they blew air, then this is not the place for you. There was an older couple that went on the balcony and danced but most of the crowd was 40 and under. One must be 18 or older to enter.If I had to do it over again (#1), I would buy my tickets outside Coco Bongo as opposed to a guy on 5th Ave at the Coco Bongo stand. The receipt and wristband he gave us worked but the wrist band was out dated, everyone else's wristband was blue while the one we got was brown with a name written on the back of it. He was just a sketchy character, it still doesn't make sense why one of us got a receipt while the other got a wristband.If I had to do it over again (#2), I would have bought the most expensive tickets. Even though I didn't care about drinking it would have been nice to have some space to myself and not being bumped into, shoved into, stepped on, etc. I know I would have enjoyed it a ton more if I wasn't packed in a crowd like sardines."

We paid for VIP tickets so had seats on the first floor and a waiter who constantly brought us drinks. We have bought standard tickets in the past and would really recommend spending a bit more on the VIP. The queues to get in can get really long if you are not there early but you get to queue jump if you have a VIP ticket. It also gets really crowded on the main floor so it was good to have a seat and a table (although we were up dancing after the first 20 minutes so didn't actually use the seats much!). The show is fantastic and is a mixture of tribute acts and acrobatics with a real mix of music and different movie themes. Some of our favourites were Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, LMFAO, Chicago, Pirates of the Caribbean and Spiderman. After each section of the show, they play a few songs so the entertainment is non-stop. The atmosphere is electric and there were people of all ages having an amazing time.Overall, the tickets were a bit pricey ($105) and we were staying in Puerto Morelos, around half an hour away, so we also had the cost of the taxi, but we felt it was worth every penny. We were there from 10.30 -3am and you get unlimited drinks - fab night out!"

We brought VIP tickets through our hotel rep, and I would highly recommend this to everyone. For VIP tickets, you get a table and chairs with a good view to all the entertainment, You also get unlimited drinks all night. You get a waiter, who just continuously re stocks your drink throughout the evening. Not once did i have an empty glass in front of me. I was 5 months pregnant when we went, and I would not normally go to a club when pregnant, however i was told by my rep, that I would be fine here, and wow, was I looked after. The staff made sure i had the table closest to the toilets. Also when I left, they took us through an emergency exit, so that I would not risk getting crushed in the crowds. The club is more of a show then a club. You can go in from 2230, and the entertainment starts about 2300, and goes on till about 0300-0330 in the morning. There is not really any room for anyone to dance in the standing area, as there is so many people there, however it is not really a dancing club as such. There is a main stage which is a few levels up (but great viewing from everywhere in the club). Every 5-10 minutes, there is a tribute act on the stage, or some kind of entertainment going on. This includes Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Lady Gaga, Madonna etc. There is also entertainment acts that take place on the ground floor (again everyone has a good view of this) which includes comedy acts, acrobats and mock fight scenes between spiderman and his enemies. I could not recommend this place enough. I obviously wasn't drinking, but I had such a fantastic night out, and would defiantly go again if I was ever in Playa del Carmen, The entertainment was amazing, the staff was very attentive, and it was just an amazing night out."

We got free VIP passes for another night so we came back again. I would love to go there again no questions asked and it's an appropriate place to go with your parents as well.

Definitely add it to your to do list, it's just off 5th Avenue in Playa which has a great atmosphere and very safe - hundreds of shops/restaurants open til late!Few things to note:Don't fall for reserving a table unless you actually want one, this is the VIP area. You do get a seat but everyone stands anyway, you will have your own waiter but every time they give you drinks you'll need to tip and you already pay for open bar anyway so save your money. The bars are never that packed - the bar an actually tapped me on my shoulder asking if I wanted a drink! Also, I would say the better atmosphere is in the lower section, VIP areas are high and views from ground are just as good.The drinks, according to my wife, are watered down and i wouldn't be surprised - they were shooting Jim Beam out of a water gun!"

Strongly reccommend getting a table as then the server is constantly coming to you for drinks - we tipped our guy $20 at the start and gave him another $20 at the end and he was very dilligent in making sure no one at our group was thirsty! In Cancun when we went it was a group of six - all in our twenties and we had a blast. In Playa Del Carmen we went with a group of 8 and the ages ranged from 23 to 57 and everyone had a blast! It really is good for all ages --- as long as you like music and dancing! Two thumbs way up!"

My sons are still going out so they are the knowledgeable ones here. I was blown away first by the \"cover charge\" of $140 for First Class or VIP whatever they call it. Its not a cover charge, its the price to see the show. It is not a disco, its non stop live entertainment, with fascinating light show, with \"Cirque-du-Soleil\" style choreographs, with dancers, with thousands of people thrilled by the intensity of the sound and experience, and all of that with hundreds of security staff and cleaners that keep sweeping the floors and managing the place so it keeps going.It is the most intense party place we have ever seen or experienced. If you go to Playa Del Carmen or Cancun, do not miss that. Looking at reviews, it looks like the price to get in does vary a lot so perhaps we paid too much. I would try to get in at a lower price the next time, but I would go back with their VIP passes. Less wait and you get to be higher with a small table so you get some space. Downstairs the regular tickets get squeezed together and wait long before getting in. And the main show (because it pops out from everywhere, walls, ceiling, etc!) is staged on the second floor, so you will see better with a VIP and a bit of elevation.Oh! And the music? Just top hits from Elvis Presley to Elvis Costello, Michael Jackson to Queen, Bee Gees to Frank Sinatra, Black Eye Peas, all top hits, all the time, fireworks, dancers, acrobats, confettis, lasers, you'll get it all!Just go, its an experience not to be missed."

We booked an evening at Coco Bongos through Thomson on their VIP package and it was really worth it.The show starts at about 10.30pm and continues until around 2am. There aren't any intervals and they just play music etc between the different acts which all adds to the party atmosphere! The drinks were included in our package and we never went without one!"

We got our tickets from a promoter on the beach, which was supposed to include drinks and a table. Shorty after we arrived the server moved us to another table, only to have us kicked off of once another group had arrived. We were left in the middle of the crowd (which definitely was over 1000 people) to get shoved and hit by the staff. The show was great, and so was the music, but the amount of people, and the constant shoving and people sweeping over my feet was unbearable. I arrived in a great mood, and had to leave early due to the crowd and staff. The crowd was also very young ( by young I mean no more than 18 year olds). They seemed to enjoy it without a doubt. Definitely not my cup of tea!"

Where you will find yourself at an awesome show-stopping nightclub where acrobats are hanging down just a few feet above you and you feel like you have front row seats to Grammy*s. Didn't know what to expect and don't want to spoil it for people who have not gone but it's so worth it to check it out!!! We paid about $55 US at the door of the club (but get there before 10 pm, they raise the prices if you buy tix when the line opens at 10:30). It includes free drinks but drinks are pretty water down. No need to get seats--if you like music you will be dancing all night anyway! The show starts at 11 pm and ends around 2:30. You dance btwn the shows and during the show. Performances were so fantastic. Try to go on a non-wknd night though so it's not so crowded! Also, a 'table' is exactly what it means--u just get a table but u're still standing. We didn't get a table and was fine being on the sides of the floor in the standing area. Better than any Vegas show I've seen (and even beats some NY stuff too!)"

It has dance floor where it's standing room only and then VIP tables on the raised sides which give a great view of the stage and the dance floor. We chose to go for the VIP package which certainly wasn't cheap but in hindsight certainly makes life easier and considering how packed the dance floor got a darn sight more comfortable! As part of the price it was unlimited drinks served by your own waiter. If you intend to have a good drink then the VIP is the way forward.CB is billed as being a \"show\" but please don't think The West End or Broadway!! The show starts with a random Beetles medley type thing which didn't really work and in my opinion was a bit lame. After this the show consisted of people in dodgy wigs miming (they all mimed, there's no actually singing) to acts such as Madonna, Katy Perry etc. Mixed in with this are music videos being screened whilst the next part of the show is being prepared.A lot of the show seemed very random and we looked at each other several times and said \"WTF\"!!! However, the atmosphere was absolutely electric and when the music was pumping and the drinks were flowing there's no doubt that most people were having a great time. If you want a fun night out then this is the place to be."

I'd definitely recommend these tickets though as I can imagine it'd be a pain having to keep going to the bar for drinks (you get waiter service).The place was smaller than I'd imagined but was really busy (we went on a Thursday night) but not too crowded.The show is a mixture of shows with acrobats and dancers, and music with videos showing so it's like a nightclub with live shows mixed in.I would highly recommend a visit, there's no way you can imagine what it's like unless you go!"

Service was excelllent, show was better than I had anticipated, as it was better than Cancun I thought, and we bought the souvenire photo and frame they took of us. Best part was tossing my bouquet from the stage to the thousand people!TIP - If you have back problems ask for a chair (As my husband got one).

I cannot stand being in a packed club where you can't even move, and that is what I was picturing. We ultimately decided to go on a Monday because we thought the crowd might be more reasonable. I am not sure what it would have been like on a Friday or Saturday, but the Monday crowd was nothing more than any other popular bar/ club would be. Not a problem at all. We purchased the speed pass ticket (I believe it was $5 extra) so that we could wait in the shorter line. That got us a spot in front of the room; we did have to look up at the stage but really didn't mind. We did not have chairs, but we were allowed to sit on the steps. It was a seriously amazing time. The shows were all fantastic, the drinks were free-flowing, and everyone around us was super friendly and having a similarly great time. Our waiter, Jonathan, took great care of us - we always had a new drink when needed. I tried to explain Coco Bongo to a friend who asked if she would like it; I told her I couldn't imagine anyone not liking it. They played every fun song you could want and the shows were high quality - lots of talent here.A few random tips/ facts: I am sure other girls will be glad to hear the bathroom was very clean and there was never a line! They had all kinds of drinks - the people in front of us were doing shots (some you have to pay for with the \"shots girls\" coming around, but some are included), I had wine, and my friend had pi\u00f1a coladas. And be careful you don't slip on the confetti which is in abundance by the end of the night!"

If you happen to be standing close to the bar do expect to be pulled up onto the bar to dance, especially if you are a woman. This place keeps on going with music, dance, performances and drinks until the early hours of the morning.

Until coco bongos i had seen nothing like this it was amazing really cant recommend it more than im about to. my partner and i paid for the vip gold member which means u get your own table and free unlimited premium drinks like smirnoff and sol. not the cheaper watered down stuff. my partner doesnt drink and even he was amazed by the night. the shows were spectacular and there was about 25 different ones a night. my favorite was tron. they did scenes from the film and were flying about the roof was amazing. I am that determind to go back me and my friend are planning to go in august i loved it tht much. shud be way higher on the list of attractions."

They do 25 short (5 minute-ish) shows that are actually really well put on. They did the Beatles, Grease, Madonna, Lady Gaga, LMFAO, some acrobatic thing where guys hang from some ropes, some latin music, Tron, and a bunch of other stuff. Awesome A/V. So good! Just go!"

I personally wouldn't be eager to go again as if you've done it once, that's enough, but its an experiece of a lifetime. It consist of a show with a difference, lots of lighting, smoke, drama and old time 70's and 80's music. A little tacky but great fun, especially after drinking tons of Tequila. Your given at least 3 alcoholic drinks on the way into the venue, which sets the scene for the remainder of the night. Drinks flow all night, which is all inclusive in the price. A memorable night, especially after dancing on the stage. One small issue though, throughout the night I kept feeling something burn me literally, it was only noticed the next day that I had burn marks down my front and on my arm from the extractor fan above our head, spitting out some sort of electrics."

When I first got to Playa Del Carmen we stayed at the Playa Palms Beach hotel, I got the impression it was a very party like environmen and became skeptical about this town. It felt like Bali + Koh Phanagan - very touristy and commercial if you have been there. Coco Bongo was fantastic!!!! I generally don't go clubbing but I love good music, the opportunity to drink and the opportunity to watch a wonderful talented fun show. Coco Bongo is a club + concert + a Circ du Soliel show all in one.* For $65 we got cover with unlimited alcohol and an express entrance to avoid waiting in line. * They gave us an alcoholic drink on arrival* We arrived at about 11ish and got a standing spot on the side corner - It was good for me since I am short and had the opportunity to climb a couple steps up when my view was blocked by a tall person.* It would have been nice to have seats at the beginning...but after a while it didn't matter because I was having the time of my life. Overall it was the funnest thing I did in Playa!!!!!"

Pulled up in a taxi and strait away there were staff asking if we were VIP or open area we were VIP so we went strait through got our wrist band and got a shot of tequila and a cocktail!!! We were then shown right to our table introduced to our waiter for the evening. We ordered our 1st drinks as it was open bar we tipped the waiter 100 peso after that our drinks were never empty we even got bucket full of bottled water on ice didn't even ask!! Music before and between the shows were awesome got us up dancing I loved everysong!! It started to get really busy downstairs and I need the looI was abit worried a woman going down on my own but I asked the waiter where it was and he personally took me down to the door perfect gentleman. The show were amazing also good music the dancers were good and the acrobats all the same we didn't leave the club till 4.30am that's when the shows finished but it doesnt actually shut till 6am I think could be 7? I definatly recommend this place we went on a weds was still busyish for the better and I'd also say go VIP its totally worth it and tipping the waiter goes a long way!!! Hope you enjoy it as much as we did !!"

The stage is on one side of the facility, but is raised about 15 feet up in the air. There is a central area below, where all the heavy drinking and partying is happening, (and so packed you can barely move) but unless you are at the back of this central area it is hard to see all of the stage.The VIP seats are located at stage level circling the facility and looking down in to the central open area. We sat just to the left of the stage, and with VIP you get your own seats, a good unobstructed view and dedicated bar service. The waiter never left our glass empty and was always there in a moment\u2019s notice.The age group ranges from 18 to even some I saw who were probably in their 60's.

Be prepared for loud music, but if that doesnt bother you, then great! The show is the best I have ever seen. Starts at 11:30 pm and the party doesnt stop until 4:30 am. There are people swinging all around the place (like at a cirque show) singing, dancing, video clips, ect. I was very impressed. Everyone was having a great time! We booked through a person at our hotel, paid $60 for open bar and we bypassed the entire line, got the best seats in the house, it was excellent!"

It is also Ladies night, so the girls paid $45 and we guys $55. This prices includes entry and unlimited bar drinks. You can buy a VIP ticket which gets you Brand name liquor and Red Bull etc... but the price is over $100.... in my opinion, not worth itThe show starts at 11:30pm and we were picked up at 10:40 by shuttles bus. We stayed at the RIU Yucatan so it was about a 10 min bus ride once we got going. You will stand in a long line to get in BUT it goes very quickly once it starts moving. As you enter the building, they are handing out drinks including tequila shots (totally optional). You will also go through a security check and be prepared to be patted down and have all purses etc thoroughly checked. This is a good thing.We were escorted through the crowd and made our way up to the top level. The place is always packed and music is very loud and the crowd is energetic (meaning drunk..lol)We stood right along the rail on the left side of the stage, so had a great view of the stage and the crowd below.The show is non stop for almost 3 hours..... Live entertainers singing (most lip syncing) and between performances they run video on the massive screen and the music is constantly pumping...It is infectious... You can't help but not get into it.There are servers for each section and I tipped our guy early (not mandatory) and he really took care of our group. We were never without drinks and most of the time were double fisted. I tipped him again mid way through and he was instrumental in getting my daughter and her friend onto the stage near the end during the KISS tribute... How cool....I think the show ended around 3:30 and we were back to hotel by 4:00.... It is a late night, so rest up prior and sleep in the next morning..... It's a great time and a MUST if you have never been"

            "review": "Most amazing club I have EVER been to!. First things first - if you are staying at the Catalonia hotel in Puerto Aventuras, DO NOT book at the Coco Bongo hut stationed in the resort beside the snack bar! Marco (I think was his name - the guy we bought tickets from) was a total liar! The experience he described was that we would not wait in line, we would have a private section in a balcony, we would have our own bartender and bottle service, and we would be taken care of in terms of having \"guides\".This was total BS! First - the bus was late by about 30mins so we missed some of the show, we had to walk some of the way because of the street closure from Carnival but they did a terrible job of making sure the group stayed together - this could potentially ruin the trip for someone afraid of leaving the resort in Mexico! Once we finally got the group together - we waited in line for at least 30mins! We got into the club and went through the line-up and it was complete chaos from there. We had to push through tons of people and the spot they showed us to at was NOT a private balcony, it was the main floor right at the front of the club so you had to look straight up to see the show, while still missing what was happening at the back of the stage because we couldnt see it! Our bartender was terrible even with tips! People were constantly pushing through us, it was like being in a moshpit. Did I mention \"Marco\" LEFT! After the show, the bus picks you up at 3:30am and we were told they leave by 3:40 if we weren't there so we left at 3:00am to make sure we didnt miss it. He was once again late by about 20mins. So we waited a long time for him. Marco also didnt tell us where we would be picked up so we had to ask the ticket sales booth at Coco Bongo!NOW aside from our bad experience with the booking company - this club was INCREDIBLE! After getting over the fact we had no personal bubble, we had a blast! They would do different shows such as Lady Marmalade, Queen, Tron, Beetle Juice, Spiderman and Green Goblin, Chicago (which we missed!), Samba Dancers, Trapeze, etc. They would do a show for about 15mins and then play music for dancing for another 15mins or so and it alternated like that all night so we were never bored! They also would randomly blow out confetti, bubbles, balloons, etc. They would also blow the audience with Co2 every once in a while to cool everyone down! It was so crazy and awesome!!! The performers are so talented an we would have gone here twice if we had the time! The only thing I would warn the ladies of, if you are planning on dancing on the bar (which was a blast!) I would not recommend wearing a flowy dress, I would even say wear pants or shorts instead. This poor girl was taken up on the trapeze bar with one of the performers and her dress came up, she was wearing a thong so she was trying as hard as she could to pull her skirt down but the guy playing Beetle Juice looked like he was holding her skirt up so she couldnt cover up. I thought that was a pretty jerky thing to do.Other than that - we will definitely go back here!"

We went through our travel agent at the hotel for reservations - paid for VIP - 130.00 open bar and a table to watch what the representative said was a Las Vegas show. Transportation was 30 minutes late - drove so crazy all 12 passengers in the car were motion sick had to pull over. Once we arrived at CoCo we waited in 3 different lines to get in but our DeltaVacation rep said we would not have to wait in line. Once we got in, we could not move - this clearly is a fire hazard our seat was in the corner by the stage workers and we could not see anything. We were so sick from the ride we only had one cocktail and switched to water. We were so terribly disappointed we decided to leave 2 hours earlier than our bus ride back to the hotel. This was not a Las Vegas show as us Americans know it as - it was a DISCO tech with some acts inbetween the dancing. Upon leaving the area slipped due to overcrowding and broke toe. I would strongly suggest you save your money. We are still disputing this charge with Delta Vacations as we have requested a full refund."

We got ours through the concierge at our resort and paid $100 each. The VIP gets you a table, all your drinks & your own waiter. Be sure when you get there that you find someone to trade your tickets for a black VIP wristband to get you in the door ahead of the line. At first we were told to wait and if we hadn't sought out someone else to ask, we would have never gotten in in time to get a table. You should not have to wait in line if you have VIP tickets. The show is fantastic, better than anything I have seen in Vegas. Some in our group were worried about being able to stay awake until 3:30 am, but once you get there, that is not a problem. There is so much going on and the entertainers are so good, there is no way you could get sleepy!"

Our location was excellent; we could watch the extraordinary show and could dance comfortably, but we were the exception.Positive: Show was amazing (starts at 11pm until 330 am), production was very good and artist and acrobats performance was excellent. It is hard to find a show of this kind at a disco. Liquor supplying is included in your entrance.Negative: Tickets are pretty expensive. Place was very small and people without VIP tickets were crowded around the dance floor, what made difficult to walk through to go to the toilets and exit."

It doesn\u2019t take a psychic to see that someday a lot of people will die in that building. Coming from a country with health and safety codes, it doesn\u2019t take long walking down the streets of Mexico to notice that at minimum, their electrical standards alone are quite different than ours. The building of Coco Bongo should maybe hold safely 500 people but the crowd packed in shoulder to shoulder must have approached, if not exceeded the 1000 person mark. This place is not for the claustrophobic!! On the bright side, they do have a couple emergency exits that with some luck you might make it to in the event of a stampede resulting from an emergency. With that out of the way, tickets are upwards of $130 USD. The more you pay, the quicker you get in. The quicker you get in, the better chance of obtaining a table. If you don\u2019t obtain a table, you will find yourself standing between many sweaty drunk people from the time the club opens at 11PM until the end of the show at 4AM. Of course, you can choose to leave early but did I mention how much those tickets were?? Ourselves, we didn\u2019t pay any money for the tickets. We were approached by a timeshare rep and decided to sit through a 2 hour presentation for a hotel and served breakfast. We read many horror stories about these but found it very easy to get our \u2018no\u2019 across effectively. Later that night, we were at a reserved private table waiting to see what Coco Bongo was all about. It was truly an amazing show with all the bad I\u2019ve just said. I do not want to overlook that at all. It was AMAZING!!! Las Vegas meets Broadway meets Hollywood meets the nightclub scene. The performances were very entertaining and one I do not regret seeing. Our tickets would have cost close to $200 USD each. After being there, I am glad we did not pay to see the show and would not pay for it again in the future BUT I am glad we spent the 2 hours listening to a weak sales pitch for a substandard resort to have the opportunity to see what Coco Bongo was all about."

We bought a VIP pass, so we got to go to Carlos 'n' Charlie's, Senor Frogs and Coco Bongo without waiting in line, paying for cabs, etc. Coco Bongo is very different than what I expected... First off, the place is HUGE!! Secondly, the club is all about these shows themed around the music they're playing. It's not about you dancing. You can dance there to the music, but it's mostly about what's happening on stage. That said, it was definitely a GREAT show and worth the money, thought I'm not sure I could stay the whole time. It's a LONG night, so either arrive at 10-10:30 and leave by 1, or come later and stay later."

Playa del Carmen is 45 minutes drive from Cancun. its worth visiting for an entire day, as there is a long 5th Avenue Street that you can stroll after after spending a few hours on the gorgeous beach. Its not not crowded, inspite of the popularity, yoou don't get to see huge high hotel building blocking the access to the beach, so yes, it is different than Cancun....5th Avenue has phantastic restaurant, piano bars, art galleries, stores you name, very original and different, and the prices are competitive, we got our presents in one of the stores on the 5th Avenue and the selection was unbelievable. Its just fun to sit at one of the cafes, eating a nice delicious lunch and drinking a cold bear while watching peaople strolling on the street, you hear all kind of languages, its really very international athmosphere.....After all, we spent a great day at Playa del carmen, not having to spend a lot of money or drive for a very long time. If you in cancun, you have to visit Playa del carmen!! vale la pena !!"

The club is set up as 15 minutes of music with a show going on with popular music. You can dance during this time but its more about the show. Then its another 15 minutes of music and back to the show so on and so on. My boyfriend and I were hoping to go to just a nightclub so at first we were a little disappointed but then we started having fun. It's kind of expensive so look for the best deal. What it really is is a mix of entertainment and dancing, 3 levels high so there are a lot of people and it does get crowded. It's nice to get a table but even then it gets crowded around you but at least you get an area. Waiters keep bringing you drinks and drinks and the show is pretty interesting. It something for people of all ages to go and have a good time we saw what looked like parents going with their 18-25 year old children and they were enjoying themselves. If you're looking for just a club to go dance probably not the place because there is not really a great dance floor but if you want something of entertainment, music and drinking this would be a good option. Around that area there are various options that are just clubs. We heard Mandelas is a good one but we did not have the opportunity to visit it. Hopefully next time!"

The best club ever!!We went there during our holiday in January at Ocean Maya Royale just outside Playa del carmen cause several people told us we have to see it! And yes, you have to see it! It is brilliant! Half dance club, half musical and circus. Its great to see different performances on the stage such as Madonna, Lady Gaga or Kiss and its even more brilliant to see people attached to strings flying through the whole place performing Spiderman, Pirates of the carribean or Tron.Service was excellent, a waiter passed us every ten minutes cause once you paid entry all drinks of the open bar are included till 3.30 in the morning. Only afterwards you would have to pay. It is a place for every age, however i do believe that under 40s will enjoy it a bit more. For the elderly i recommend a Gold upgrade. With this you get access to a special floor with more tables and opportunities to sit, relax and enjoy the show.This club is definitely worth the money!!!!"

We were given a shuttle to and from the club, we were ushered past the long lineup to get in. I guess this made it a good value compared to hopping in a cab and going it alone. We were given a waiter William, he brought drinks, and I tipped him $10 us bucks, maybe it seems he is not used to getting tips because he kept drinks flowing for us even when we didn't ask when we were walking around. On a nice note: my girlfriend lost her camera, and bouncers handed it back to her at the end of the night, was really not expecting to find it again. We were situated just above the general floor area. It was extremely uncomforable, I've been in packed venues before, but you just had your space to stand on the sides and that was it and hope you didn't fall into someone. I was disappointed in that it wasn't really a dance club that you could unwind, and get loose, it's more a show (which was amazing to see). Due to the bar in the middle, there's little if any room to dance. There's no real actual dancefloor like a lot of other nightspots out there have. It was a good overall experience but I probably wouldn't return."

We bought gold member tickets, were informed that we would have a guide and that security would be very visable. We were assured that this excurtion was safe. What a joke...Soon as we get on the bus, the little guide named Isabel, whom only introduced herself when I insisted she provide her name was nothing but a b..... you could tell she did not want to be there and she did nothing to ensure that we made a good decison. First thing she says is ... who is gold member... what did you pay for you tickets... nice... than she informs us as we arrive that the bus will be parked two blocks away from bar.. get to know your bus drivers name because he is the one taking you home.. and you better be here fro 0330 or else ..you can find your own way home... nice.... than she states if.. you get sick on the bus be prepared to pay $25... nice.. than she hurries us to the line up and starts to walk away.. I ask her.. are you not comming in with us?.. She turns with a scoul and says NO.... WHAT THE HELL.... no one is informed of where we are to proceed too... the couple behind us could not even speak english... my god what a start to a night.. so we get in and we are directed by security with flash lights to our seats.. the place is hopping.. suddenly the a large crowd feels what looks like a sink hole ... they can barely move, but are so intoxicated that they put up with it... needless to say... as much as i wanted to join in.. i did not because i was so concerned that we would not be able to find the bus.. i have a hard enough time when i am sober.,.. lol.. the only thing i could think about was.. god if there is a fire in here.. we would all be dead.. this place definetly breaks all the safety codes and its just a matter of time... We ended up leaving early and thats when we were introduced to our security guard... nice... eh... he assured us that the guide was wrong to tell us that we had to find the bus, that he was going to escort the group... well that was a little to late assurance.. nice.. so we end up taking a safe cab that he arranages., cause if you take a city cab... although cheaper .. you might get ripped off.... nice... I definetly do not recomend this place and I am not surprised by the above claim that two woman were sexually assaulted.. this is no place for woman to be .... they dont care.. they just want your money..."

BE AWARE that sexual assaults have occurred behind the stage by the Coco Bongo security staff on the female patrons. On Friday, January 6, 2012, two female patrons were sexually assaulted by staff at Cogo Bongo behind the stage. The curtain comes down bewteen shows and female patrons who were dancing on the stage are left in the dark surrounded by security personnel with flashlights. These male security personnel, physically restrained these two ladies arms and hands and proceeded to remove clothing and fondle their breasts and even succeded in penertating one lady with their fingers. The ladies resisted as best they could but could not see in the dark and were unable to be heard due to the loud music. These employees of Coco Bongo were extremely aggressive which makes me believe this pre-planned and is occuring on a regular basis. Each lady had three to four security personnel restrain and sexually assualt each of them. This occurrence has been brought to the attention of Coco Bongo management and we are awaiting the result of their investigation. Please be advised that these two ladies are mature (41 and 43 years old) business professionals from Canada who were NOT intoxicated. This makes us wonder... what is happening to the young 18-25 year old intoxicated feamles who from the majority of the feamles on stage every night? By the way, male patrons are not prohibited on or behind the stage just the security staff. Please be careful."

Lines were long and security tough, many checking points made you feel like you are entering some important area. You got a first drink which made you dizzy straight away. I am not sure if why that happened. I drink hard liquors all the time and one cape cod (vodka +cranberry juice) doesn\u2019t get me drunk. I felt dizzy after 5 minutes after drinking it. Was it spiked with something? I will never know, but my friends felt strange about it as well. Main club area was over packed, we barely found any place to stand. We could not focus on shows because constantly there were people stepping on my feet. I ordered couple drinks from the bar, but they were very bad. I didn\u2019t not order anymore, I was not going to drink that s..t. I asked for Kahlua, but barman looked at my bracelet and said something in Spanish which I didn't understand. Never mind. I liked the music, it was great to dance to. Shows were so, so. nothing really special. I deffo didn't like that Jesus on Cross show. I think it was some stupid art-misinterpretation. We left about 2am, had enough.I recommend this show for people who wants to get drunk and dance to good music and don\u2019t care about anything else. We expected little more than that with that price."

In febuary I stayed at Sandos caracol eco resort & spa for week, our rep said there was two options, I could go to Coco Bongs though the bar itself (it was $100 and ride was not provided with the price) or I could go on the Party Hopper. This was $80 ride to and from the resort you go to 3 bars Carlos & Charlies, Senoir' Frog, and Coco Bongos. It was all canadians on this party tour. The guys that did the party hopper were very good the drinks were included in the price so they would get you your beverage for you (so no one could put anything in it) if you needed to go to the bathroom they escorted you. It was a blast all around!"

Once inside the Coco Bongo, we were taken to the upper level, but found it very hard to see what was going on around the club. We decided to wander down below to the floor area between the two bars. Well... suddenly , we were in the middle of the show. Everything was happening right above us. What a show!! Spiderman swooped over our heads, what seemed like only inches above the crowd. We could not see much of the stage above us, but most of the show was out over the crowd , so it was worth being on the floor. It was much faster getting drinks served to us on the floor too. It was very crowded inside, but well organized. The sound and light show were second to none. We picked the Mayan Riviera again for this coming January (2012) mainly so we can return to The Coco Bongo. Last year we paid $50 each for our bus ride and it included the bus ride and admission... including... all you can drink while inside. Well worth the price. Can't wait until we go again."

When you first walk into the club you can be overwhelmed by the amount of people that are in the place, let's say it's a bit crowded. Don't let that sway you from having a great night ,settled in find a place to watch the show, and have a great time. The drinks don't stop coming, and the staff couldn't be more friendly. You never have to worry about going to the bar, your waiter will take care of you all night. Don't forget to tip your waiter, they work hard. It's a great place for all ages you have people in their 20's to 60's, it's non-stop fun. I never wanted to go to the bathroom because I was afraid of what I would miss.

We each had two drinks each in our hands and the waiters kept asking us if we were ready for another. Needless to say, alcohol is limitless. I've seen tons of shows and gone to a bunch of clubs in LA, Vegas and New York etc. etc....and this tops them all.

I was keen to go on this trip if not a bit sceptical because I didn\u2019t think I would be able to stay awake long enough to justify the price for the gold ticket, however we still decided to go to it, and we are so glad we did. First of all we booked the trip and the gold ticket via our coco bongo rep at our hotel Iberostar Quetzal. Before I booked I made the point of asking the rep to guarantee us our table after reading previous reviews I had read I wanted to make sure, he said this was no problem. We were picked up promptly from our hotel lobby at about 2200 with us falling asleep as we were struggling through jet lag, and my partner and me both said that we would leave the show about midnight as we were both knackered....ha!!! We arrived at Coco Bongos and initially were given a standing area with a small table, but we had a word with our rep that straight away without any fuss moved us to a private area with a private table overlooking all the entertainment and with hardly anyone there. What can I say we were served drinks without asking and before we had even finished (the tickets are all inclusive so all drinks are free) intermittently we were given shots also. The acts were amazing and as were all the balloons coming down and streamers ectr, we looked around during part of the evening and our section was the only section that wasn\u2019t crowded! Someone came round offering photos too throughout the night, and we left after a fantastic evening at about 0445, so much for falling asleep! What I would say is I\u2019ve seen on some other posts that they couldn\u2019t see a fire exit, well we saw them clearly from where we were although these were written in Spanish, and I would also suggest getting the gold member ticket. When we do go back next year we will deffo go back and will do it earlier in the trip as we felt it helped us get over the jet lag!"

The acts are fabulous and you'll see things you'll never see anywhere else. The cheesy getting girls up to dance on stage and screen inbetween acts is a little rubbish but ignore that and you'll have a great time. The tour we did with Thomson's included two bar trips before coco bongos and to be honest they were not up to much. Boasting all inclusive drinks was not advised that they were only on a selection and the venues themselves were not that great. But it did give you free drinks inside coco bongos for around \u00a340 each so def worth a trip."

Once in after a short wait we were shown a spot to stand , had a really good view from there. I felt good knowing they take they're time checking people on the way in, as I was out with my daughters. They had no problems that night at all as they opted not to drink but just to dance and have fun. I always tip and did which may not have been to my advantage in this case cause I enjoyed a few too many :P The shows were really good and fun was had by all people of all ages around us. The girls loved the music and danced the night away. Because the service was so good we missed the buss back to the hotel :P and had to gab a cab, it was very late and the girls were a little uneasy with a group hanging out near the cabs, but no problems we couldn't handle.

We booked this club poolside at the Valentin Imperial Maya from the Co Co Bongo rep and paid 110.00 American for the entry to the club, drinks, seating area and bus ride. Several of us from the pool booked together deciding it would be a interesting activity. The rep that sold us the tickets said we would have our own table and waiter for the night with all drinks included. The bus arrived on time to pick us up but then stopped at another Hotel to pick up other guests as well. We arrived at the club 15 minutes after the show started because it took so long for the bus to load at the second stop. We were then jammed into an oversold club, could not see the show, as people were standing in front of us so we had to stand on our chairs if we wanted to see, and as far as getting a drink, you drank whatever the wait staff brought around on their trays, as the club was so packed it was impossible to get to the bar to order anything. We got there at 11:15pm and were back (via a 25.00 taxi ride) at 12:55am (the taxi ride is approx. 25 minutes) Needless to say we did not stay. The rep that sold us the trip disappeared and we did not see him again at the club or at the Hotel pool all week. I feel because we were late our seating was gone and he just stuck us up on the 3rd level in the back because that was all that was left. He made no attempt to better our seating or explain anything, he just told us to: \"stay here\" and left. I don't know if you booked through a tour operator such as Apple if the experience would have been any better, but this club was definitely oversold, had poor drink service, and virtually no way out if there was a fire or fight.. They say Cancun is a better place to see the show, as the club there is larger and more organized, but we did not go there personally, so I can't vouch for that."

This is pretty much the same layout, same show.. The show is AMAZING. Yet I did not enjoy this visit as much as the Cancun one because..For some reason the entrance to the club seems disorganized. There are multiple lines of people waiting on the street to get in. If you don't have your tickets at this point you can still get them on the street as there are a number of people out there selling them. Once in you will be directed downstairs where the lineup continues. All in all.. Takes pretty long to get in. We had a general ticket, I'm not sure if you get in faster if you're VIP.Once in.. The place is packed.. I mean packed. Almost impossible to move, the only place we found to stand was close to the bar which is good but so close that you can't see the stage or you can see but your neck breaks while doing so and you only see the front. You can not sit anywhere unless you have VIP then you can go up to the other levels where seating is available. I recall having a very dedicated waiter in Cancun, here not only no waiter you had to squeez through to the bar.. And back every time you wanted a drink. The show is really nice if you get to enjoy it seating down and you can get up to dance when you feel like.. As this is more of a show than a regular club, you need VIP tickets to do this. For this amazing show to happen there is the staff working hard to deliver. Confetti would cover the whole club ever 10-15 minutes or so and while you're standing there trying to have fun cleaners will constantly excuse themselves to sweep around you. With no space to stand in the first place it gets tricky. We did see one waiter drop a tray while trying to get up on the stairs filled with people. I'm not even sure how they manage not to drop them with over 10 drinks and no space to move at all. Long story short, the tickets are expensive, but if you don't like to be pushed around and stepped on for hours then consider getting VIP to enjoy your night out."

            "review": "A Wild Time, Worth the Price. I decided to go to Coco Bongo after seeing footage of the show on video kiosks on Avenida Quinta. It was fairly pricey -- there are three price levels: $30, $65, $100 (in US dollars). With all three options, drinks are included, but only the top ticket price will get you a private table with a dedicated server. We chose the $65 tickets, which gave us express entry, and seating in the communal table area. When I say seating, I actually mean we were seated on steps -- long benches really -- and shared our server with about 20 other people. This, however was no problem. Drinks are included in your ticket price, but be sure to tip your server. The cocktails are well watered down, so we switched to beer after a couple of sickeningly sweet margaritas. After all, you can't cut beer. The real attraction here is the show, which is really, really something to see. It features terrific dancers, celebrity impersonations, and acts based on popular movies. Oddly, some of the movie references were quite old -- Beetlejuice, anyone? This does not dampen the festivities, however. There were also aerialists and trapeze artists. The club is extremely well organized and when you see the amount of staff that is constantly and vigilantly keeping the club moving all night you cannot help but be impressed. Every 15-20 minutes confetti canons filled the air with paper and streamers. At one point, balloons were shot out over the crowd. Video projections, live camera work, and the energetic, terrific cast make this a feast for the senses. Highly recommended. We left wondering why this doesn't exist in NYC or New Orleans -- two towns that seem perfect for this hybrid is disco and high-level entertainment mahem. Wear comfortable shoes, as you'll want to get up and dance."

It was like a fusion of cirque du soleil, a concert and night club lol You don't have to be a night club person to go here and have a great time. There were people of all ages (over 18) and whether you want to wear shorts and a tshirt or a cocktail dress with heels you'll fit in. You will be entertained ALL night long and well taken care of by your waiter. Don't even think about it...just go! You won't regret it"

And the beat part is that the drinks keep flowing! You don't even need to get them because there are servers that always keep you refilled! You don't even need to be drunk to be there because it's such a blast yo wanna remember all of it! Just writing about it gets me excited! This place is a blast for all ages(minus kids). I will always recommend this place to anyone I know going to Plya del Carmen! The entertainment was so great you never want to leave! The party doesnt stop and you never wanna leave!

We regret not having gone there sooner! We paid extra for the Gold access which I recommend as it gives you early VIP entry, top shelf open bar service to you VIP area, and complimentary shot upon entry. We booked through our resort so the price was discounted and included transportation. Gold level guest can interact with the lower stage performers when the VIP bar is converted into a stage at various points in the show. Upper stage performances are top notch as are the aerial acts. Expect 5 to 6 hours of non stop entertainment and partying. Considering what we pay for night clubs here in New York, Coco Bongo is not only a bargain, it is the best experience we've ever had in a club type atmosphere. If partying, drinking, and dancing are not your thing there is the half priced option to sit on the upper level and simply watch the performance which is well worth the time and money. The only negative is that you will have to sleep in the next morning to recuperate! Let loose and have a great time at this bar / dance club / theatre!"

            "review": "You wont be dissapointed!. I traveled to the Mayan Riviera for the second time this summer with my boyfriend and having not been able to go to Coco Bongo the previous year we made sure it was a top priority this year as trips off the resort went. What an amazing time it was! I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great night out. You can take a taxi into the city and just pay at the door to get in.. but you'll be on the bottom floor and will have to look up a lot for the shows. I think the best bet is booking with someone on the resort, it just saves you a lot of hassles and is a lot more safe than trying to get yourself home in the middle of the night drunk as a skunk.There is definitely a trick to getting a good Coco Bongo experience for the lowest cost. First of all don't let the Coco Bongo Rep at the activity pool of your resort con you into spending double what you need to for a VIP ticket. Our girl was trying to sell these at $140/person and all the VIP people were getting was a little bit higher view in the club and tables to sit down at. They try to tell you a bunch of other crap like how you'll get line bypass and your waiter will be around to serve you more than anyone else. We booked with our onsite Travel Rep for $65/person plus $5 for the line bypass and ended up a couple of steps down from the VIP people.. so they paid $70 more per person to have a table to sit at. That might be worth it to some people, but definitely not for us! As for the waiter coming around.. no matter what you've paid to get in this place its busy as hell and these guys are pumping out drinks and bringing them to people as fast as they can. The first time he comes around give him your tip for the night and you've done about as much as you can as far as getting him to come back often. We went with 4 friends we met on the resort and we gave our waiter a $30 tip ($10 from each couple) and we never went very long without seeing him. He would bring us multiples of what we ordered at a time along with little shots and other drinks choices that we didn't even ask for. There is a little ledge where you stand where you can line them up so you don\u2019t have to worry about holding all these cups. UNLESS when you arrive you don't try to be the first ones from your bus into the club. There were people that were positioned behind where we stood from our group so they were kind of just back there and didn\u2019t have anywhere to lean or put their drinks because of it. These are the people who either didn't pay for the line bypass so they had to wait outside for 20 minutes or so.. or they just took too long getting from the bus to the door. My biggest suggestion is to get off the bus and make your way to the door as quickly as you can so that you're the first in your group to be put into place there for choosing where you want to stand and how much room you want for yourself. Throughout the night it obviously shifts around as people go out for cigarettes or to the bathroom but for the most part where you get first is where you'll be for the night.The show is amazing! Not even worth trying to explain just go and see it for yourself. They alternate between the stage and acrobatic shows and just regular music with something playing on the screen. Confetti and balloons flying, bright lights, and people going nuts. It's a very involved place.. I think my favourite thing about our time there was how involved everyone is with each other and the people putting on the show. You feel like you're a part of it. For the more daring ladies you can go stand on the side of the stage and ask to go into the center on the little platform when the regular songs are on and they'll let 2 or 3 girls go out at a time to dance.. Never guys. I'm not sure what time they stay open until, but we arrived at 11 and had to be back at our bus for 3:30. When we left the place showed no signs of stopping anytime soon, so if you go independantly I'm sure you could be there until the sun comes up.Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely reccomend going if you're looking for a memorable night out in Playa Del Carmen. We will definitely be back next year!"

Our first 2 were in Cancun but Playa Del Carmen was the best! Playa Del Carmen is a little bit smaller, but it has all the same shows and fun as Cancun. This place is basically the craziest club you've ever seen confetti, balloons, lights, arial performers, dancing on stage, and drinking your face off. They play everything from new dance music, classic hip hop, and rock, something for everyone. What made this time the best was our server, Eduardo. Our reserved table was front and center in the heart of the action. I don't think I've ever had so much to drink! First drinks came 1 for each of us, then 2 at a time, then shots, then more drinks, then more shots, etc. all night long! I think one round we got 30 shots, for 4 of us! Not only was Eduardo great on service but he was friendly, and fun. When he wasn't getting drinks he was dancing right with us. Hopefully we'll be back to Mexico soon. We will definitely go to Coco Bongo, and request Eduardo. You should do the same!"

Don't let the fact that the show only starts at 11.30 put you off as you will not look at your watch once while there as they constantly entertaing from start to finish with party music smoke machines, wind machines streamers glow in the dark band's you name it! We booked with the Coco bongo Rep at our Hotel who provided an excellent service they took us straight from the hotel showed us our spot and then brought us straight back! Don't book with Holiday Reps as you will miss some of the show especially T C project with Thomas Cook! Get in early pick your spot (Don't just accept first spot rep offers you) and stay there waiters will bring your drinks for you without you even asking. Never once felt scared as it is one of the safest and fun clubs I have ever been too! If you tip the waiters you will get a brilliant waiter service especially if you have Edwardo! Yes you are reserved a standing spot there are seats but anybody who wants to sit down while in there have gone to the wrong place as you will want to Dance!

If costs $60 each for transport there, fast entrance, own area balcony (standing only) with open bar, waiter service and bathrooms.We arrived before showtime and there was music playing with the countown clock on the screen. We were also given balloons?!? You watch the shows through balloons, streamers and bubbles all night and it is so much fun.The shows last about 10-15 minutes each and are AMAZING. We were on the top balcony facing the stage, so most of the acrobatic/flying dancers started from there and are so talented and brave. In between the shows they play party music, it is crowded and loud but everyone dances on the stairs, balcony's with some on the podiums - be aware if you do this make sure that you are wearing decent underwear as blasts of air blow your clothes above your head (saw a few sights!!!). Because my son was 21 (we had previously informed the club) - they put the cameras on him, so that he was on the huge screens and they played 'It's my party' then 'happy birthday' to him. They also gave him a few teqilla shots to drink while everyone sang and the cannons fired the confetti on him! He loved every minute of it.Michael Jackson is not dead because we saw him here and he was fantastic!!!!! Beetlejuice is really good and sooooooooooo funny and we had a group photo taken with the main guy.This is an over 18,s club and does not finish until 3.30 a.m. so be prepared for a late night."

If you like an insanely crowded place with non reserved seating and no guarantee of any seat than this is for you. Basically in a nutshell we paid 60 a person for an express pass to sit on the stairs where people are constantly walking up and down bumping into you, my wife had a drink poured on her. Sitting in a walking path was no fun so the wife and I lasted about 30 minutes max. The next fun part was leaving, we had to fight the crowd by pushing everyone in sight to get out only to find out that you can only go out the way you came in again fighting the crowd, or you could go completely to the other side of the place and again you had to push your way out. Complete fire hazard. After reading other reviews the only way it seemed people really enjoyed it was by paying 100 plus to get a seat to really see the show. Like I said earlier the show seemed as it would have been awesome but seating was rediculous and it seemed no concern to our tourguide or anybody at the facility itself. As of now I will try to get the money back or just chalk it up as a loss."

If you have issues with crowding, not having any space between you and the person next to you don't go. You are are on top of each other, literally. We paid $55.00 for the ladies and $65.00 for the men. That included transportation from Riviera Maya, express entrance, drinks, table with chairs (not all tables have chairs), and our own waiter. We booked it through a congo rep. and she stayed with us the entire night to make sure we were taken care of which was very nice."

A cross section of music is covered by some very talented people. It was Cirque du Soleil meets the best club you could imagine. If your hotel offers tickets and/or transportation, this is the your best bet. It gets packed and the express line helps get you in quickly. Once you are in, it is up to you to find a spot and stay with your group. BEP, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Gaga and Queen are among the great artists that are covered. The aerialists, dancers and little person put on one hell of a show. Take a nap, get there early and enjoy the show."

So we would recommend going during the weekly days. There is just one big 'but' (as you see in the title). We bought a 10 dollar ticket from a guy called 'Robert' (he's around 40-45 and he said he was from Canada) at the beach. He promised us that with that ticket you pay 10 dollar at the beach and 45 dollar at the door. And because you pay a small amount in advance, you will be VIP and get the same as the people who pay 100 dollar at the door (your own table, free extra drinks, fast line to get in etc. etc.). We just had to ask for him as soon as we would be at the Coco Bongo door. When we where there, all dressed up and wearing extremely high heels, since we would be VIP and that meant that we would get a table so we could sit and watch the show, there was NO Robert. The people from Coco Bongo knew him, but said they could not do anything for us. He is working for them, but makes up his own story at the beach while he sells the 10 dollar tickets, so he will sell more and get more commission. Anyways, we left and went back an other day (without high heels). And we had a great time! Just do NOT buy your tickets from Robert at the beach or anywhere else in town, cause his stories are not true!! But def. visit Coco Bongo and you will have a great time!!"

We we just looking for something different than the resort entertainment. We decided to pay the $100 per ticket for the VIP experience. It was the BEST part of our vacation. If you do not go, you've missed out on the best experience you will ever have entertainment wise. I am 43 years old, and was afraid it would be just for the younger crowd, but it is geared toward entertaining everyone. It was well worth the $100 VIP pass. I would have paid double that. I have paid more than that for concerts/shows in the U.S. and they weren't even half as entertaining. It was jam packed with fun! I highly recommend it if you are in Mexico!"

            "review": "AMAZING EXPERIENCE. We went on the party hopper excursion June 16. They pick you up at the hotel, & several vans meet in a parking lot near the ferry in Playa del Carmen. Wound up being in a group of ~95 with 5 tour guides, who are also double as your waiters in the bars. We paid $85 each on a Thursday night, which includes all drinks. Before they start, after the briefing in the parking lot they do ask for an additional $5 a head to tip the staff in all the bars. Didn't seem like a lot & the bar staff do help out the tour guides getting drinks & serving etc.  I thought it would take forever to get a drink, but it was very well organized, they had a counter full of drinks ready when we all filed in and our first stop was Senior Frogs, lots of fun, got good seats & the drinks were coming as fast as I could drink them. Had to slow down & pace myself actually. Carlos & Charlies was next, nice balcony, drinks ready when we arrived, not quite so entertaining as senior frogs. Then it was back to the busses for the short drive to Coco Bongo. We got there around midnight. When we first got there it was a little intimidating as it was so packed. The place holds 1800 people (at least) & 100 of us arrived and the show was already in progress. The problem was the floor was so absolutely jam packed it was hard to cross the floor to get to our \"area\". My wife lost me briefly & was getting a little panicky. At this point I was thinking the review from May 6 who complained abourt the crowds was right, but after 15 minutes or so my wife found me & we found a place to sit. The show(s) were amazing. There is no other way to describe it. There was never a dull second,Elvis, Michael Jackson, Maddonna, Black eyed peas, Lady Gaga, even Beatles (before we got there), a little something for everyone, even an old fuddy duddy like me. I thought it would be a sweat box with all the people, but every 10-15 minutes 4 huge jets from the ceiling flooded the place with dry ice fog, cooling you off by 10 deg C in about 2 seconds. Again the drinks just kept coming & coming 2 at a time & I tipped the server an extra 100 pesos for doing such a good job. In no time it seemed it was 0230 & time to head back to the bus & hotel.  My wife dragged me to this & I'm glad she did, we had a fantastic night we'll remember for a long time!!"

We went here as a party of 9 ranging from 20 to 50We booked as part of as an excursion with Thomas cook which included a 3 bar tour prior to entering the clubCannot tell you the bars we went to, but for the older members of the party we had to sit outside the 2nd bar due to the strobe lighting and ended up moving onto the 3rd bar before the rest of the group.Got to coco bongo at about 12pm (I think) all I know is that the show had already started and we were led to the highest level of the club, although had to go back for missing members of the party a couple of times.Being a little on the short side and not being able to see over everyone's shoulders as the club was rammed to the brim before we got in I really didn't get to see mcuh of the show, however what I did see was very good.The music is fantastic, drinks available very quickly and you could have what you liked.Only negative is I wished we had got to the club a little earlier not sure what time the show starts but I know we missed some of it.As a part of the tour with thomas club the coach picks you up at 2pm, which is just when you are getting started with enjoying the music and enjoying yourself. You can stay on and make your own way home but having already paid \u00a390 dollars each as a party of 9 would have hated to think how much it would have cost us to go home by taxi.I would recommend this night out to anyone, but consider a trip that gets you to the club before the show starts, that way you may get a better view."

It took less than 20 minutes to get in and as soon as we were in, our waiter was right on top of things and had drinks for our whole table of eight in less than 3 minutes. The entertainment portion started at 11 pm and lasted until 3:30 am with a couple of intermissions allowed for stage/costume changes in which great songs were played & they allowed customers to dance on the bar located at center stage. Huge range of entertainment with music of all decades and genres, great dance moves, movie skits, acrobatics and so much more. I would recommend a camera with a quick shutter and allows night shots. Also, although this is considered a club and club wear is appropriate, I would recommend comfortable shoes as we stood the whole time (our choice)."

The info. about the place was it held 1800 people but there must have been double that,as you could not move,see anything,get drinks. All I saw was a guy in a beatlejuice costume once and we spent the next half an hour trying to find each other.Even after I found her,I quickly lost her again as we were trying to get the hell out of there.When she found the exit the guy at the door refused to let her out and she had to get angry with him to get out.It took me 10 minutes to find the exit and while looking for it,I'm sure I sent dozens of drinks flying since the only way to move in there is to put your shoulder down and push your way through!(sorry to those people,I'm sure that was the last drink you saw that night)Once we found each other outside there was a couple from Ontario talking to one of guides.They were in our group behind us and he fell on the stairs and made a hole in the drywall(we heard the crash while in the hallway),and the coco bongo's people wanted $100 cash and he refused and they kicked both of them out before even getting in!We left them there arguing and took a cab back to our resort. We're really shocked that Nolitours/Transat has no regard for their customers safety,a place like that would never be allowed in any town or city in Canada(fire).Also still waiting to hear from them for our request for our money back.So if you think you're going to see a show,dance and have a good time.......NOT!"

We were a bit hesitant about going because of the 10:30-3:30 am time frame....didn't know if we could stay out that late anymore! The minute we walked in we knew we made the right decision! The party started the moment you walked in and kept you entertained until the very end. We were amazed at the quality of the production - like nothing we had ever seen before - sort of a mix of a big new year's party at a giant nightclub, a crazy rock-concert and cirque de soleil. Never a dull moment. Something new happening every time you looked up! I saw people say how great the drink service was, but we had quite the opposite experience. We were turned over to our server by our host from the hotel who brought us to our reserved area right along the rail next to the stage - awesome view!! We gave our waiter $10 with the first order so he would keep coming around and we never saw him again! We ended up getting our own drinks and got stopped on the way up twice by other waiters who took care of us. I think he may have forgotten we were with the group, as another couple that was with us (same age range) had full drinks everytime we looked over. Must have been a fluke though as other reviewers say how great that part is, so I won't let it affect my review....If you do not like to stand for a long time or don't like loud music, this might not be for you - but if you like to have a good time and dance, you need to experience this show! Also, we were a bit nervous when we walked in and were herded downstairs into a long hallway and no fire exits in sight. Made us mom's a bit nervous thinking 'what if there were a fire?- we would all be screwed!'. It seems codes in Mexico might be a bit looser than in the US.All in all a fantastic show!!!!"

It's definitely a club you pay a visit to when you are in Playa dle Carmen. Try to call in a reserve a table in advance so you can get the best spots and views :)"

As this was my second trip to the Mayan Riviera since January, I wanted to go out and have the time of my life and I danced the night away until 4 am. My wonderful group of 4 women - ranging from my old self at 50 to the youngest at 30 - and our friend John spent THE BEST night out at Coco Bongo's!!Barbie, one of the fab staff at the Ocean Coral piled us in a van and for $50 each we had a private section, space to dance, a great view of the stage and dance floor, and a bartender who kept us in drinks all night! I don't know what was the most exciting part of the night - the musical numbers, the rocking music that had us dancing all night or the acrobatics of the performers! I haven't been out to a night club like this ever and I can hardly wait for my daughter is old enough to come along with her old lady!To sum it all up: I felt like a kid again!"

This included shuttle there and back from the club, entrance, free drinks, a dedicated bartender, a reserved area. This was the best option. The party hopper is just a waste of time since the reason for it is the last destination - coco bongo. We went on a weekday so it was a bit cheaper and less busy, but I will say it was still busy! We waited in line but only for 20 minutes, our rep came with us the entire way, inside through the check points etc. and took us to our spot and introduced us to our bartender. He recommended we tip him $5 on our first drink and after that he would take care of us. he was not wrong. our bartender was great! he just kept coming, drink after drink, I lost track. We were down on the lower level, on the steps which was fantastic. this was a great club/cabaret experience. The shows were fun, the music was fabulous. They played the best music and from all years. We just danced and sang all night! The next thing you know its 4am! The bathrooms were clean, very impressive with the number of people there. The security was excellent. if you needed them they were there instantly to help. We had our space and no one invaded it, it was just great. I would definetely go here again."

The shows put on were poorly executed and badly lip synced. There was no rhyme or reason to the choices made. When the DJ decided it was time to dance, they would only play about 30 seconds of a song at a time, so just when you were getting into a groove, it would stop. The busyness of the club was almost unbearable - they pack you in like sardines so good luck doing anything but standing for 4 hours. Probably the biggest rip off was the drinks! I actually asked the waiter if he forgot to put the alcohol in my first drink because it was so weak. I've never in my life tasted such weak, watered down drinks! At our resort they offered a standard admission of $70US an express $80 which gets you in faster (not worth it as we just stood in line and got pretty much the same spot as these people) and finally a VIP admission of $110 which would guarantee you a table and seats. Regardless of being able to sit, I would NOT waste your money. If you do choose to go here, book through your tour group and NOT the resort you are staying at as it will be cheaper, and they were tell you of all the scams."

They try, but the bar is very small and with the non-stop referee whistles and the clowns honking horns, etc. this bar was just plain annoying. Avoid this bar at all costs...From there we went to Senor Frogs. This bar was great. It's right on the beach, there is a trampoline out on the sand, that several customers were out jumping/laying on. They had a live band playing that sounded awesome. Given a chance to do this again, we would walk the 1/2 block to Senor Frogs and skip Charlie's altogether, and just hang there waiting for the rest of the ground to catch up. From Senor Frogs, we loaded up and drove over to the COCO BONGO CLUB!!! This club was the whole reason we signed up for this tour and it didn't disappoint. It's like a night club/dance club, add Vegas shows and throw in New Year's Eve with a dose of steroids!!! We had a great time and will definitely be going back. The advantage to the bar crawl is 2 fold, you have round trip transportation from your resort, your drinks and tips are all included and you have a reserved area at the CoCo Bongo Club on the upper level, near a bathroom and right next to the stage. It's wicked awesome and worth every penny."

Its way to packed good air conditioning tho, ppl flying around the room, don't ever sit on the first floor or under the stage because you'll have to crank your neck the entire night to catch a glimpse of the show. Not much room to dance and you can't mingle with anyone except the people around you... Drink service was great always had a refill and shots were poured every min..

Hey, we're here to help out.

One washroom for men with 2 urinals inches apart. No toilet, so forget the other stuff.The show starts, and it's good, but it becomes obvious pretty quick, there is no dancefloor, unless you count standing on the bar top, and having about 18 inches of room to dance. So my group within 20 mins all moved down to the main floor to dance. However, of course the bar dance tabletop is full of women, and us men end up watching the show, and the women dancing. And every 15 mins, they would clear the bar top dancing, put a top on for the performers, then 15 mins later, open the bar again for dancing. This went on several times throughout the night and it got really boring.The show is all pop culture references, beetlejuice (how current is that?) the Mask of course, batman, spiderman, pirates of the caribbean, madonna, lady gaga, frank sinatra, and on and on and on...Oh and LOTS of paper being shot out all night, I mean LOTS, cover your drink.

I really had no idea what to expect as I didn't look at their website, etc. First off the entertainment is great. I only stayed for 3 hours and I liked what I saw for the most part. There were a couple acts that I thought could have been improved, but I realize I'm not going to like everything. I would have like to have stayed and seen the rest of the performances, but my negative comments below should explain why I didn't.When we got to the location my group and I got in the \"Express Line\" for those who had bought tickets in advance. We were only the second in line! As we stood in the humid heat, we watched as \"VIPs\" repeatedly just walked into the doors. When we got into the building, we were escorted to a step. Literally, a step! Our group of five had to basically sit on the floor! There were a bunch of \"Reserved\" seats at tables but we were told we could not sit there. Right away we were so disappointed but it only got worse! As people kept filing into the club, our visibility of the stage was diminished. My 61 year old mother had to ask twice for people to stop standing in front of her. As we looked around, we saw that 80% of the people in the club WERE STANDING! This is not a place to go if you can't stand for long periods of time (I have a problem with my knees). Our \"seats\" had no cushions and my back was in extreme pain after my three hours there.This club is so crowded it's insane. About every 5 min. confetti is blown out into the crowd. Every time this happened I saw people either covering their drinks or fishing out the confetti that landed into them (ew!). After the 20th time of this when the confetti was on the floor about 6 inches deep, a guy went around cleaning it up! He asked us to move repeatedly. The waitstaff and others crammed into the club kept asking us to move. It was hard to enjoy the entertainment with the horrible seating and standing arrangements!The female restrooms were clean enough but there were only three for a large capacity. And when you read signs saying \"all those using illegal substances will be sent to the proper authorities,\" you feel like the place has a past with drug use.I think more people would attend the club if there was proper seating. Perhaps tables where people could sit and a dance floor below? This experience was definitely interesting, but I honestly don't think I would go again. How can you enjoy such a place? I'm starting to think the only people that can truly enjoy this are those that drink heavily to the point where they don't care about the enjoyment of others but only getting their money's worth from the free booze."

I went into the situation thinking that it was going to be a dance club and I wasn't going to have a good time, but that was FAR from the case. Right from the get go I was like oh my goodness this is going to be crazy, but awesome. I started off the night in our little vip area, but quickly made my way down to the main bar to start dancing on top of it. Within 3 seconds of being on the bar, i had the bartender tap me on the foot and hand me a shot. This happened LITERALLY 5 times in the first minute and the rest of the night was dancing history. The shows itself were pretty cool, but the confetti and balloons that fell every 5-10 minutes made my night. It was just mayhem and I loved every moment of it. My fiancee(now turned wife) and I were quite intoxicated(understatement) and we left the place without her purse and didn't realize it until the next morning. After checking with our friends who went with us if they had it, we quickly realized that she had left it there the night before. We talked to Rosaria(sp) the person from the Royal who took us down there and she told us to head back there that night after 8 hoping a manager would be there. I'm thinking, great, in Mexico, a packed bar, and a girls purse... we have NO SHOT at getting it back. But, we figured we'd give it a shot, so late that night we head over there and get taken to the side door. We talked to a gentleman who took the description of the purse and told us to wait one minute. To my astonishment he kept opening the door telling us they were checking. I thought they were going to wait 30 seconds and be like, 'ehhh i don't care about you at all, oh no sorry we couldn't find it'. WOW was I wrong. After waiting about 15-20 minutes the door opened and there was her purse. What a relief! Inside was everything that she left including an iphone, cash, camera, her makeup etc etc. I was so elated that I took all the money out of my pocket and fanned it to the employees thanking them and wanting them to take the cash as a thank you. But they simply said no no no, it was no problem, keep your money and have a good night. I was absolutely floored and what went from a potential disaster really gave our wedding trip a new momentum. So, to the workers of Coco Bongo, and to the gentlemen of the side door... thank you soooooooo much, it was an experience that I will never forget, and you can be damn sure that when we return to Playa next, you will be seeing my smiling face!"

For the $55 basic admission, you will be in an upper tier, which is good if you prefer to sit, drink, and watch the show and the people on the lower levels dancing in between acts. I don't know if there's dance space on the upper levels.If you go on the main floor, Yes, it will be extremely crowded--like clubs in Vegas, Miami, or Chicago. But if you're into clubbing, you want to pay the extra. You will be able to dance, and if you are wearing a tight dress, the bouncers will probably pull you up to dance on the bar. They even let guys up there, which I haven't seen in the states (actually, I've seen guys be very rudely kicked off platforms, etc. Hooray for the friendlier attitude in Playa!)There will be a Vegas-quality productions that lasts for about 15-20 minutes followed by an interval in which the DJ plays dance music (the night we were there, it was an awesome mix that would appeal to everyone there: Black Eyed Peas, current pop and lots of 80s, Bon Jovi, Mana, Ricky Martin, stuff people knew and were singing along to rather than heavy techno.) Meanwhile, there are periodic balloon drops, confetti releases, etc.I was astounded by the lavishness of the shows: video screens, light shows, aerialists, good dancers, flashy costumes. The sets featured celebrity impersonators doing sets by artists such as Austin Powers, Queen, Elton John, The Mask, and Moulin Rouge. Drinks kept coming faster than I'd have expected considering they were prepaid and the waiters had to navigate through a packed crowd. I don't know if there were any options besides beer or tequila...but do you really need more than that? ;-)My husband and I are in our 40s, and the friends we went with were all in their late 20s-early 30s, and we all loved the music and shows and decided the night was the highlight of our trip. There are two reasons I'm not giving it all 5 dots: * the length of the line and pretentious attitudes of the bouncers outside--all that Vegas junk about making passersby want to come in because they see a big line outside--I hate that* the cost. It's a good value for the money, but it's still more than a lot of vacationers are ginog to want to spend."

When we first arrived outside Coco Bongo we were told that we could get in for $40 a person, we then talked with the employee and got it down to $20 a person, but we only had $50 and needed money to get a cab back to our resort. We (the 2 girls) left and went to Blue Parrot which was nice, and then were walking back to Coco Bongo when the same employee told us we could go in for free. We were really skeptical and thought it was a scam and that we might get arrested, but after he confirmed it was free. He said all we had to do was drink and dance, which we agreed! It takes a couple of minutes to walk inside and they check your wristband several times. When we walked in we got some shots at the bar, which were pretty good, but definitely not very strong. We were amazed at how big it was. Flashing lights, smoke, and confetti was falling from the sky. It was a stadium style seating with different levels that had standing, seats, and bars. We made it to the middle and got onto the stage where we could dance with people below us. I jumped onto the trampoline, but was immediately told I could not go on the trampoline by the employees. After 10 minutes of dancing to strange techno music the show came on and we went up to one of the stadium seats. There are some areas that say \"reserved\" and we accidently went onto one of these floors, but it seemed like the girlfriend was jealous that her boyfriend was talking to us and told us to leave. We found a seat and watched the Lady Marmalade show which was great. Then we watched the Acrobats where people were hanging in the air from large drapes. After about 20 minutes of watching the dancing continued. Overall the safety is pretty good, there are safety officers walking around everywhere with flashlights. My friend and I held hands the entire time to make sure we wouldn't get lost, and we covered our drinks at all time. I would recommend not bringing purses or cameras because they could easily be stolen. Overall I highly recommend going to Coco Bongo either by paying the $40 or getting in for free!!!!"

I was very surprised by the show, never expected to find that quality of production in Playa de Carmen, kuddos to the owners and producers. However, there is no control of the number of people coming in, and the place gets overcrowded, and regardless of all the security measures to get in, crooks make their way in, and some naive people bring purses and other valuables and leave them unattended. Me and I my family got escorted out of the club by security because an idiot next to us got her purse robbed, and took it against us, even to the point of making contact to search my daughter. I was amazed that when we got out the exit door, they had already caught the thief, and handed him over to the police, but the damage was already made to my party. The careless couple who got robbed, and the club manager came to us with apologies, but that did not change my daughter's breakdown, who ended up in ER until we could calm her. or get back our reputation, lost when hundreds of people stared at us leaving the place escorted by a few security guards.All in all, if you want to see a good quality show, go to Cirque du Soleil, and if you want to have a drink and dance, go to your favorite joint, Coco Bongo is a corny mix which does not justify the risk taken by going there. Even if you have made reservation for a \"private\" table, people will be running over you, and careless idiots will take purses and get robbed,"

The show starts at 11pm and goes on until 3.30. You have impersonators (Beyonce, Michael Jackson etc.) and they also recreate scenes out of films.There are people flying through the air on wires, hanging from the ceiling it is just ace!!Every now again a siren would go off and paper, bubbles, streamers and even balloons fell from the ceiling.Coco Bongos was absolutely the best part of my holiday and I cannot wait to go back!Have fun xx"

Much of it is waiter service as its difficult to move but the staff are amazing, balancing drinks and making sure you are refreshed throughout the show. Try and get a table up on the side so you dont strain your neck watching the ents but wherever you are, you are guaranteed an amazing time.This place is for ALL ages, yes its crazy but the music is for everyone and the shows are incredible. If a Coco Bongos came to the UK, I'd be there every weekend - its non stop!We chose to go twice during our holiday and we werent disappointed. Thursday was just as busy as Saturday.

There staff works very hard and you will not be without a drink or near an empty cup, clean-up and refills are impeccable. Now for the trap part of it. This was more like a vegas show without any organization. They picked terrible songs and didn't stick to any theme. I think if they stuck to a theme I might have been able to have a good time. You want a decade theme...fine. Soft rock theme... fine. Festival theme...even better. But instead they chose a boring sinatra song to play, they had a guy dressed like Austin Powers dancing to Wooly Bully... really? of all the 60's songs? They picked Tom Cruise's movie Cocktail and tried to replicate setting the drink on fire with actual aerosol cans which two of the performers dropped! Despite this one of the performers kept trying to light as he was covered in flammable liquor until a staff member ran up and took it from him! They played Meatloaf's \"I will do anything for love\"...I was just confused. There was no space to dance. 90% of the crowd was completely still not knowing what to do. They didn't clap or dance... we were all confused. They only people dancing with what little space they had were way too drunk. Beware of the spot lights the shine about 10 directly into your eyes. I left within an hour of being there and waited in line for 30-40 min. Waste of money."

If your legs have cement in them, your eyes will pop out and move. Pre-shows while waiting outside. a small stage out front on second level will entertain occasionally. The service was amazing. I don't know how they got everybody drinks for 5 hours. We had a male server around 30 years old and made the experience that much better, I wish I knew his name. He was very grateful for our group and looked out for us with extra chairs (even though we didn't use them) try to get stadium seating so get there early.(Pro to me) they will not serve drunks that cannot control themselves so control yourself and friends or they will be escorted out.Tequila Shots upon intrance (Two spots)You can go again and see completely different showsCons (not really) : Cost is $50 to $70 usd. If you have a group coco bongo rep. may offer a free ticket to the group. however, Drinks are in included in this package so it will pay for itself (Also take care of you server and bartender and they will take care of you and your group (pull your tips together and give half up front and half at the end) Tempting to look at the website to get an idea, try to avoid doing this. The surprise of the experience out weighs doing that.Bathrooms are few and far between and attendants will expect to tip (so use pesos)No food that I saw so eat before. There is a Taco bus right outside of the bar in a scooby doo van. Really good but they had the hottest hot sauce I've ever ate. (I was even warned by a very sweaty american that said if you don't like hot don't have the medium, so I had the mild) didn't matter they were all amazingly hot - Great after experience though.Advice: Try not to sit under main stage cause you won't see the shows, tables by the center stage are cool at first but after an hour the stage is transformed into a bar and movement becomes limited, unless your a hot chick or (really drunk guy) then you can dance on the bar all you want in between shows. Get there early if your not getting express entrance. Do not do this as part of the party hopping package because you will want to stay at coco bongos and the other 2 bars are free to get into on any day (Senior frogs and Charlie's up the street)go with a hotel and group and begin to discuss options and prices early. also they may provide transportation if you are in resorts further away (we were in the Palace spa 15 miles away) so we got a $60 round trip for free (tip not included) We went on a thursday, still packed and easier to get in then friday or sat. closed sun. but they do open it if tourism is high.I may sound more like a promotion but I'm just from North Dakota so I see this stuff much. My wife says it was like 50 vegas in one."

(21 at heart counts too)2. Did you sign up with a good tour group? This is make or break!My wife and I (27 & 26 for reference) were the only 2 in our shuttle that weren't given entry bracelets ahead of time. We had to go through a line to get ours before going in (though not as bad as we thought it would be.) We had no 'special treatment' whatsoever. When we walked in we had \"bench seating\" on a narrow step surrounded by other party-goers. The others from our shuttle at least had a reserved table, but they too were slammed into the middle of the action.We were expecting something more similar to a Vegas show and at first it was setup like a dance club with a bunch of employed dancers \"clubbing it up\" on the center stage. Add in the staff & their irritable whistle-blowing and we weren't feeling it at all! We didn't think a show was actually going on that night and it was just a dance club. After immediately debating leaving, we instead tried to get a more comfortable place - but with reserved seating everywhere and balconies \"closed\" to non-VIPs initially we were stuck among the masses and feeling like sheep! We couldn't even move back from our step to a corner or wall where we might avoid getting stepped or spilled on (more 'reserved' area that we weren't \"exclusive enough\" to access..)Fortunately the actual show started and we were relieved that we hadn't been hoodwinked into paying $55/person for a night of clubbing. The show really is a combination of spectacle & full blown audience participation (dancing) - and since weren't much feeling the dancing we were only partly enjoying ourselves.Our saving grace was the open bar (mai tais and rum & sprite - no martinis.) After a few drinks we were finally alright with a bit of grooving & the staff let up on the herding - we could finally go upstairs and into some breathing room.I'll admit that it is a great place if you're ready to party. They really do a great show with acrobatics and costumed dance performances (our favorite actor was the shorter of two Beetlejuices - quite comical!)I mentioned that your amount of fun will depend on your tour group. I'm pretty sure we signed on through the club's own shuttle service and it is not recommended! They told us to be outside to leave promptly at 3:15 AM and were something near 25 minutes or more late! They also didn't take care of us whatsoever inside. We talked to others that went through 'Olympus Tours' (staff in orange shirts) and they had a tour guide from their shuttle that stayed in attendance with them the whole time and made sure they had fun, getting them drinks and providing full service. They were also able to go into the best of the reserved areas. I think they did a trio-package where they went to Senior Frogs and another place before Coco Bongo. I'm not sure if Olympus offers as much service for a smaller trip of only going to Coco Bongo. Whatever you go through I would definitely ask exactly what to expect in their services!"

It's a very very busy club, that has an elevated theatrical stage with impersonators, dancers, 'shows', and in the middle has ropes and fabric hanging from the ceiling on which performers perform ala cirque du soleil. The show starts at 11:30 p.m., and goes to 1:30 a.m.. Our resort had a shuttle which leaves at 10:30 and returns at 3:30 a.m. After the show is over, it's a dance club filled with 20 something-ers dancing for another couple of hours. It's an 'all inclusive' type place. You pay a fee to get in and your drinks are included all night. We went with our resort, and I felt safe with our 'handler'. We had a spot to stand, you really can't move around until after the show. You can't really even sit, so be prepared to stand and dance for a couple of hours. I knew just about every song, and sang my heart out (no one can hear you because it's loud!). The night we were there, the impersonators did Michael Jackson, Rolling Stones, Freddy Mercury, Guns n Roses, Madonna, Frank Sinatra...and a few more I can't remember. The cirque du soleil type people were amazing, using the fabric to swing through the place, and lift up to the ceiling. There were also ropes on which other performers flew around the place.

The show itself is a mixture of Cirque de Soleil (although not to the same skill) and every tribute band that has ever played. The performance is relentless and with a free bar which is served continuously at your table (recommend that you pay that extra $10 for the express tickets and get there 15 mins before opening to get a good table), you are going to find it very hard not to have a fantastic night."

Just getting off the ship and addressing my curiosity developed into a well deserved memory. I enjoyed the little printed messages on the life savers, the popcorn in the dog bowl, the dois xx time two and the cheese enchiladas. They were not the best I have ever eaten. However, I really enjoyed the scenery, the time I had there and the moments I took to have that experience. Would I go there again. You bet."

After a long slow walk around the town in the very hot sun there is no better place than Senor Frog Bar to have a very refreshing drink, people watching and watching the ferries coming and going from the Ferry Terminal next door. Only thing I have against this bar is that the music was a little on the loud side, or that may just be me not to fond of loud music"

You can order a drink and they let you use all the facility (chair, shower, wifi). We took the cruise shore excursions and we had 2 hours to chill here. The only con is this is right next to the speed boat dock and we can smell the gasoline."

The drinks are made with pre-purchased mixers, the food is mediocre, and the service is dismal.I came with a group of friends who were visiting from another part of Mexico that I used to live. I live in Playa Del Carmen, and I was the only \"gringo\" at the table. I ordered a beer, and an order of nachos. Simple enough.The waitress came back with a pina colada. I told her that I ordered a beer, but she insisted that I ordered a Pina Colada. I said, \"ok thats fine, I'll take it.\" Not a big deal. I finish the Pina Colada, and I again, ask for a beer. She comes back with another pina colada. Again, I tell her, \"I didn't order a pina colada, I ordered a beer\". Again, she gives me a hard time, so I just take it. For a 3rd time, I order a beer. I was so unequivocally clear this time. I even had my Mexican friends speaking spanish for me, ensuring that I would get a beer, not a pina colada. I also asked about the nachos that I never received. At this point everyone in my group was ready to leave, but I had still not eaten. I asked,\"Can I get the nachos to go, because I won't have time to eat them now\".The waitress comes back with ANOTHER pina colada, an order of nachos on a plate, and separate order of nachos togo. I tell her, \"I'm not taking this Pina Colada. I did not order this (or the previous two), every one at this table heard me. Are you serious\"? I also told her, \"I'm only paying for one order of nachos, I did not order two plates of nachos\". She instantly became angry and proclaimed that I did order the 3 pina coladas and two nachos, and I was going to pay for it all. I requested her manager. Surely he would correct the situation. Wrong. I was told that I'd have to pay for it all, or he was, \"calling the police\". Really? This was before he even heard me out. It all made sense when I realized the pina coladas were 4x the price of the beers (which I was fine with paying for the first two). But not 3, and an extra order of nachos. SCAM ARTISTS! I haven't ordered a pina colada since I was a 12 year old (virgin of course) The manger got aggressive, and had his entire team gang up on me, and try to beat me up, after they scammed me. I don't believe, I was misunderstood, I believe I was scammed into a drink 3x the price. However if something was unclear, a waitress at a predominantly tourist restaurant should know to ask someone for help if she doesn't understand an order. Furthermore, a manager should have been an advocate for his customer. He should have calmly asked the waitress, \"Is it possible there was a mistake?\" He should have gotten to the bottom of the frustration.I live in Playa Del Carmen, so I know how to effectively communicate, and order correctly here. 12 months in Mexico, and I have never had this problem.Moral of the story: Don't go to senior frogs if you're from abroad! They will take advantage of the language barrier. Senior, of senior frogs, do yourself a favor and fire your overly aggressive, and under-qualified manager.Vibe, trashy. Food, mediocre. Staff, rude scammers. Why spend hundreds of pesos on pre-mixed drinks? Don't. You have other options. Go somewhere else!"

We had free lunch vouchers from purchasing a few tours from Lomas Travel.Everyone enjoyed their food and the entertainment was fun for all of us. Music was good. We also enjoyed the open air lunch experience on the beach."

The drinks were very good (coconut daiquiri) that I had in the palm tree glass that we kept for souvenier. Had the wings that were excellent. Crispy to perfection with the side of dips. Could have spent a few more hours there if we had the time. Plan on coming to visit again on our next vacation to Playa Del Carmen!"

The atmosphere was fantastic, with music playing as we watched the waves as the sun went down. There was a variety of people there, with different ages and different sizes of groups...everyone having a fun time.

We were seated at the bar in the swings, which were uncomfortable.This is an open air bar, so it was very hot. The only Air conditioning in in the restrooms, and there was an attendant so you were obligated to tip to use the bathroom.We ordered drinks, which were a bit expensive for Mexico. The bar tender went out of her way to ignore us. When I finally flagged down another bartender, he had difficulty taking our order and when we asked for refills on our beers, wanted to get us more expensive drinks.Thankfully, they had an English speaking cover-band playing music."

It was my boyfriend's birthday, so they took him on stage and gave him shots (and some other stuff haha).They also gave us a free dessert for his birthday, wasn't expecting that.They let me behind the bar to make my own to-go drink! Beautiful view of the beach, and ferry dock. Great, attentive service. There's someone selling pictures, and someone selling balloon animals (seems like a good idea after a few drinks).I'd definitely go again!"

The location is right on the beach and next to the ferry terminal so it does get busy but it was no problem, why rush when your on your holiday anyway! We ordered a pizza between the three of us and didn't have to wait too long.The atmosphere was great and the guacamole was too! The waiter was very attentive and made a fuss over our 12 year old daughter! They put a \"drunken tourist \" sign on the back of her chair! She saw the funny side of it so that was ok! We enjoyed our visit & would go back again. We've been to Se\u00f1or frogs in other locations so knew what to expect."

We got waved in to sit anywhere. We got a waiter that was kind of confused and often missing. We had a pesty shot-woman bug us three times even though I said I don't drink. We sat near the Beach Rail and watched people disregard any safety on the trampoline. The food was franchise average. The bill was reasonable but took forever to get.  The gathering of people for singing and dancing is annoying during a lunch atmosphere."

It can get real expensive real quick though as the staff are there to up sell eg shots, photographs, home made guacamole and even balloon animals! However it was one of the last days of our holiday so we just went with it. The shot girl and her routine were funny and she definitely surprised the 60yr old Dad in our group but he loved it! The food was tasty and the drinks were cold, blended and lovely. We bought a group photo as a memento too. I couldn't recommend the place highly enough for an afternoon of fun by the beach. It was expensive but worth every penny as we laughed about it for days after!A special mention must go to our waiter Hugo who was fantastic!"

The fish tacos and guacamole were delicious. Our hotel gave us a free margarita so we wanted to check it out. They get you with the paparazzi and the oxygen bar, trying to get more money out of ya, but it was fun and we couldn't complain. It was very hot inside tho. Muy caliente."

My husband and I ate here immediately after traveling on a plane and a bus from Cancun. We were starving and this was the first place we saw. Upon arrival the first question is, \"want a seat at the bar?\" The goal is to get everyone to drink a lot. The food is surprisingly quite good for a place like this. Everyone walking around was only wearing bathing suits, drinking drinks out of those foot long cups, and yelling and screaming a lot. The waiters were all walking around the bar getting patrons to take shots while blowing very loud whistles. For what it's worth, if you are looking to get a bunch of drinks on the beach, this place is for you. It was clearly a lot of fun for the people looking for that type of experience. They take credit cards."

Several people, including myself got bumped into the crowd and into furniture as people had to run up from their seats to the microphone during the \u201cName That Tune\u201d session.After all was said and done, we were shocked at the prices of the drinks and our tab which had been run up in our group. Bottom Line, this is a VERY EXPENSIVE place to have fun. If you are in a group, it is best to do separate checks so you don\u2019t get stuck paying for the freeloaders in your party.

They have a large variety of drinks to choose from but they full of sugar and more likely to give you a stomach ache than a buzz if you have one of their fish bowl size glasses. The staff are typically friendly and the service is okay though again it varies from night to night.The guy in the bathroom selling candies is a little off putting, especially when he offers to sell you something other than candy\u2026 He is also typically pushy for a tip and just generally gets in the way.

Almost no reaction at all. This is the worst place we did visit during our 10 days in PDC- and we NEVER come back to any SenorFrog again. Stay away, this is really really bad"

We went with a group of friends and we were given the VIP treatment from when we walked in, we had balloon hats, sombreros and a table on the balcony looking over the sea. The photos cost extra but if you're quick you can take a group selfie before they take the sombreros! It was great the entire time until we came to pay! DO NOT LET THE WAITER WALK OFF WITH THE MONEY!!! We payed all together and had all of the money on the tray to pay! We all counted it to check and we left a $200peso tip, when the waiter took it he disappeared and came back saying that we had underpaid, after a bit of an argument struggling against the language barrier we shelled out more money! It ruined the trip which was a shame, either pay upfront or don't let them out of your sight and your night will be amazing! Don't let it deter you I would definitely go again!"

I am certain that their other locations DO NOT reflect upon their Playa Del Carmen location... If they DID - they would NOT be in business...The ONLY thing they have going on is their location which is right on the beach in PDC... Other than that, expect to OVERPAY for food, and definitely drinks... For what we paid we could have gone to a TGI Fridays here in the States and gotten the same food quality and overpriced everything... In other words - DO NOT waste your time at Senor Frogs.... In PDC, apparently, it is about their name recognition... Next time we are in PDC we will just go to one of the local bar/restaurant and, hopefully, get better food / booze / service for a MUCH better price... If you want to get overpriced EVERYTHING, I would suggest eating / drinking at a restaurant in the airport on the way home.... Pretty much the exact same experience (without the view of course)..."

The Senor Frogs in Playa Del Carmen IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. We had made reservations for a night out. We were going to buy the all-inclusive package for drinks when we got there. We saw the vibe of the place and decided to leave after 10 minutes. The location is cool as it's right on the beach. However, transportation cannot take you right to the door. It's a bit of a walk. And if you're in heels, it's torture to walk the stone streets to get there.The bar was completely dead. There were maybe 10 people there. BORING.We should have gone to Coco Bongo. It was a few blocks down. They had a line that went on for blocks to get into there. Lesson learned. "

The portion was huge but I wasn't impressed, I ordered a margarita which had very little tequila if any in it, when I pointed it out to the waiter he had it refilled and this time I could certainly taste the tequila.

Both times were as expected. Excellent! The second time really stands out. We had 2 little ones with us (one 2 and one 6) and the staff did everything under the sun to make these little girls smile and laugh! We had balloon hats, crazy sombrero hats and they even let the 6 year old use their \"air cannon\". The signs hung on the roof are hilarious so are the signs they move around the restaurant. My wife was \"silicone free\" and I was a \"mommas boy\". Didn't even notice them placing them. The stage and DJ make for a great time. They found a bunch of girls from the beach (best beach in Mexico) and had them preform Wrecking Ball on stage, waiters with napkins in their ears applauding them. It was just a blast. I ordered the fish tacos and my wife had the coconut shrimp, both are Delicious!! A lot of reviews on here say it's touristy. But being a resident of Canada means I am a tourist! I love it and will return here every time I am in Mexico!"

You can't beat the location right on the beach in Playa. The food was good, service was good, and the drinks of course were great. It's smaller than a lot of SF locations, but again you can't really beat the view and location. Spent a lot of time hanging out, enjoying the view, sitting on the swing seats at the bar and having a great time. Until we got home. There were 3 of us that used our credit cards, and all three of us had our numbers stolen and charges of thousands of dollars were attempted at local Playa businesses and stores. Discussing with each other, we know it was here that our numbers were stolen because it was the only place in common that we used them and it was the only place in Playa I even used mine. So sadly a great experience was marred by the staff stealing our credit card numbers. Thank goodness for fraud departments who catch stuff like that. So always be sure to call your card companies to tell them your travel dates (the charges happened after we were back in the States) and watch your statements online closely after you get home."

It was about 9:00 at night and there was no one over the age of 18 in the place-obviously the \"older\" people (I'm 29) are smart enough to know how ridiculous this place is. The scene reminded me of a bunch of children getting wasted for the very first time and trying to prove how \"grown up\" they were by grinding and flailing around on the bar and dressing as cheap and skimpy as possible. I was embarrassed to be seen walking out of the place. It was so packed with hammered kids we could barely work our way back out. It could be perfectly fine during the day, but I got a terrible impression at night. Not necessarily the bar's fault-they just happened to have really tacky clientele the night we were there."

We were tourists! My sister and I had no idea what to expect, but we had a ball! Granted, it can get a little bawdy, at times, with some of their signs and the way they serve the drinks (especially the one in the palm tree). But we found the food to be quite good (I had shrimp fajitas, and she had a burrito) and the drinks were good, as well. Our waiters, Julio and YiYo are what really made the visit the most fun! These guys are off the hook, LOL! I thought the staff seemed to cater to those at the individual tables, and probably took advantage of the fact that there were two women (me and my sister) at our table, so it might have gotten a little crazier. But there were people in there with children, and they all seemed to be having a good time. We were there on a weekday, probably at about 4 or 5 pm. Would definitely go again, and recommend it to others."

Our girls were a little more apprehensive, so we asked the waiters if they would bring our girls up to the front and dance with them at some point (tipping them of course).

The restaurant overlooks a beach and the ocean, so try to get a seat near the balcony overlooking the view (if you're ok with watching drunken vacay make-out sessions, and smoke wafting over your dinner.) The food was only so-so, standard for a chain restaurant, nothing special. The decor was very interesting with kitchy little details all of the place, lots to look at! The waiters were very involved with the diners, walking around pouring shots directly into peoples mouths. They would also pull people onto the dance floor to dance with them regularly. I'm not at all into either of these things, and managed to wedge myself into a corner where they couldn't access me (thank god.) It was very entertaining and hilarious to watch, but as an introvert, was terrified they were going to seek me out at some point, as it was mostly women they were going for. There were clowns onsite, making balloon creations for diners. They were pretty funny, and requested tips for their work, but I don't believe they were employed by the restaurant directly. There didn't seem to be a limit on the alcohol, as there were multiple visitors who were completely wasted. One woman passed out in front of us, smacking her head on a table on the way down. Seeing someone bleed profusely from the head wasn't exactly the highlight of my trip. I wouldn't go back, but if you're into the party scene, it seems like a relatively safe/fun place to get drunk."

After several trips to Yucatan Mexico, and hearing about how much fun Senor Frog's could be, my teenaged daughter asked if we could go there during a daytrip to Playa Del Carmen. We decided to try it out for lunch on a very rainy day during Christmas week 2013.And... meh. The atmosphere is classic \"Caribbean Beach Bar\", with open sides and swings at the bar, a large stage and a thunderous sound system. We were seated after a 10 minute wait (1pm, though whether the wait was longer or shorter because of the heavy rain falling outside, I couldn't hazard a guess). Our table was pretty much dead-center in the not-very-large dining area, which was also probably the epicenter of the excruciatingly loud 70s-disco music track. My ears started to hurt almost immediately (and I left with a splitting headache from a sound-hangover).The wait staff are actually quite attentive and pleasant, and the menu is \"Gringo-approved\" with safe Tex-Mex and \"Amurrican\" choices including burgers and familiar Tex-Mex standards. The food wasn't actually BAD, it just wasn't particularly good or authentic. It was also on the expensive side (not just by local standards -- the prices are state-side chain restaurant +50%). My family tried a few different dishes: my wife ordered the appetizer cerviche, which was a heaping bowl of solid tilapia-based cerviche (a little salty but decent) with a cone of tortilla chips. My daughter had cheese enchiladas (similarly large portion, pleasant but undistinguished). My son had \"Andreas tacos\" -- beef and vegetables, the most flavorful thing we ordered. I had a Cobb salad -- once I got the forgotten dressing, not bad.Similarly expensive -- and this could be an issue if you're going to Senor Frog's to party down -- the booze list. As you'd expect, the menu is heavy with fruity concoctions in souvenir cups, but even basic beer is expensive ($9 for a 20-ounce schooner). You'd have to be pretty determined, and pretty unimagininative, to get drunk at Senor Frog's.Overall -- the \"cool\" factor wore thin very quickly even for a 14-year old. The food and beverage options were thoroughly average and expense, the music was deafening and stopped all prospect of conversation, and -- at least when we visited -- the crowd seemed to be going through the motions of having fun, more than actually having it. Pretty sure you can do better in Playa Del Carmen."

Yes, I have been one of them at one point. SO if you're looking to PARTY this is the place for you, even though there is a bunch of eager staff waiting to get you drunk and get you to spend your money and of course...there are always children present. Apparently it's ok to take your kids into bars when you're on vacation. ;) During the day it is more quiet and it is right on the water so you can people watch and relax with some chips and salsa and cold beverage of your choice."

Sure the clown was annoying, and the guys walking around putting sombreros on your head and placing goofy signs by your table were not entertaining. Who cares...that's what you expect when you go in! I had the coldest beer and the best pizza I have ever had that afternoon! And IHBtoledo picked up the tip. I would definitely return."

Within 5 minutes a \"clown\" came to our table, asked us where we were from, put a few balloons on my head, and asked if I thought he deserved a tip. Then I went to the men's room. A man stood at the door and watched me relieve myself. After I washed my hands, he handed me a paper towel and then looked at a basket with a \"TIPS\" sign on it. Evidently I was expected to give him money for his services. These incidents soured me on the place. I will not be returning."

We missed the 3 pm ferry and there was not another one until 5 pm and we had not eaten much of a lunch. This is a very touristy place that we would normally not go to, but it was hot and it had a beautiful view. It is right on the beach and honestly it is on one of the prettiest beaches I have seen with the white sand and beautiful turquoise waters. The staff seems to have a good time. They also do the best they can to have you buy \"extra\" things. They took our picture with a sombro and then framed it for us to buy. (honestly it is one of the cheesiest things we have ever purchased, but we do laugh when we see it) Just be prepared to say \"no\" to several things unless you want to spend twice the amount for your meal.The live band they had was terrible. I think they murdered several songs that we both really like. The people watching is interesting. It is amazing to me as to what people wear on a beach. My husband was enjoying some of the outfits. Ha!I understand that this is supposed to all be in fun, but they have a women's bathroom door that says to slide and it is bolted shut. The women's bathroom is on the other side of the wall and is out of sight. I suppose there could be some entertainment value to watching drunk girls try to get into the bathroom. The food was average and kind of expensive. However, it was better than I thought it would be. I realize that you are paying for the location and \"fun\" of it all. I did get the guacamole and they come and make it on a cart at your table to your liking. We got the pizza.It is a fun atmosphere and the location across from the ferry gives it a little boost."

There was only a handful of people in the bar so not much atmosphere in the bar due to lack of people which cannot be helped. They have a wide selection of drinks and cocktails in lots of different sizes and you can keep the glasses if you want to. we paid around \u00a310GBP each for a 'Palm sized' cocktail. Just be weary as each time they give you your bill they include a 60 peso tip in the total, as we were all paying separately this added up - it is not compulsory so just pay the cost of your drink and tip as you see fit. Some good souvenirs and worth a visit if you are in the area - enjoy"

We only meant to have a quiet drink but we ended up being dragged up from our seats and made to do silly dances with the staff. This then turned into a conga line with everyone in the bar being roped in and we all had free tequila poured down our throats at the end of it! I got dragged up to dance for a second time and ended up being taught how to salsa! I really didn't expect to be doing all of this at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon! The staff are so much fun and genuinely want to make friends with their customers.The cocktails are to die for - so refreshing on a hot day. The only reason I'm not giving 5 out of 5 is because they were a little overpriced but if you don't stay long then it's really not a problem! I didn't try the food but the table next to me had fajitas and they smelled amazing!If you're in the area I really recommend you pay this place a visit!"

The bathrooms were very dirty with tissues all over the floor. The bartenders are less than appreciative of your business and would rather joke with one another than pay attention to paying customers waiting for a drink. There are way more authentic Mexican eateries and bars that are more focused on service and appreciate your business. This place is not on the revisit list. Will never go again."

So after a couple minutes I looked at my wife and said OK, let's sit at the bar. Then the bartender did his job but there was a person I believe maybe a waiter? Wearing aunglasses inside amd that may have been a factor?! That waiter brushed up against me with a large box of some sorts carrying many bottles if beer that actually cut me! I didn't want to make a scene so I just kept on talking with my wife and let it go, but then when he again walked by and bumped into her, that was enough and I had to say something to the person, and I did and left. So we spent $30 instead of $100, and then went to the Tequila Barrel which truly gets and appreciates your business. Service is everything, this place has the perfect spot, no doubt but when you get to the point where the people that are your business aren't held as priority, they will disappear.

The price was \u00a38 ! Very OTT prices and the service was not exceptional as it was day time it was fairly full, i would have expected better service.We would have left a tip but no one came to serve us when seated, so my husband went to the bar and a mardy faced girl served us without a smile.We didn't go again, i was very disappointed as i was looking forward to going since arriving in PDC. There are better bars and also a lot cheaper."

The staff seemed like it was a chore to be there. the girl who showed us to our seats gave us the drink menu and told us our waiter would bring the food menu, without so much as a smile. The waiter came about 10 minutes later, placed the menu on the opposite chair (they're huge wooden menus) and told us he'd be back soon for our order, while we placed our order he didnt even look at us, then brought our food without saying a word, just placed it on the table and left. I needed a knife and after trying to get someone's eye contact or attention for a while I decided to go and look for a waiter.It was just me and my partner and we did notice that the bigger tables of 4 and 6 people were getting lots more attention, getting balloon hats, silly signs to get their picture taken with etc but we got none of that. The portions were HUGE so although the prices are quite high compared to neighboring restaurants you do get your moneys worth, the nachos (starter) could easily feed 3 people and my burrito could easily feed 2. We got a portion of chicken wings as a side and they came with chips which it doesn't mention on the menu, I'd have had the chicken wings alone as a main course. Overall I was very disappointed after looking forward to it for so long."

We have managed to avoid Senor Frogs (maybe if they had a Senior Frogs we might be more attracted) on all of our trips, but after a rainy day of touring Tulum and with an hour to ply away before our ferry back to Cozumel, we were drawn into this fun restaurant by the laughter (not so crazy) and the music and the thought, quite frankly, of just sitting down and watching our ferry come in (I mean, have you seen those ferries load and leave? Don't blink and don't miss your ferry!). We ordered drinks all around and a plate of nachos to share since we weren't really even hungry. What great drinks! And what a platter of nachos! Nachos to knock your socks off! We were initially dismayed - how could we possibly eat that mountain of nachos? But, not to fear, the amazing eating team chewed and sighed their way through to victory. We saw lots of families bringing their kids in, who LOVED the activities, the music and the fun, not to mention balloon hats! There was a great beach with lots of seating and you could choose to be as close to the fun and action or as far away as you wished, even though it was packed. The service was great and friendly and we loved their tee shirts - quite a bargain at $25 since we expected $45. We want to go back!"

This was my first visit to the one in Playa Del Carmen, and it will be my last. It's like the family black shep that's hidden away,and indeed it should be. This is a Disgrace to the Se\u00f1or Frogs brand. We went around 8pm on a Saturday night in June, and we're told there was no entertainment. We got a table for four, 2 adults, 2 kids. When we were shown to our table, we waited ages to be served. I think this was to do with the waiters concentrating on a group of girls at the table next to us. When we did get served we ordered our meal. They then brought out the starter which was nice. We were sat at a tiny table which really should have been for two. Halfway through the starter they brought out four mains. There was no room for the plates. When the mains came the quality of all four was awful. All dishes were loaded with salt. We could have taken my sons pizza down to the beach and used it as a frisbee. When I complained to our waiter that he had brought out the mains before we had finished the starter, onto a tiny table, he could not understand my complaint. He was American so it was not anything to do with language. My family were very upset, as on previous visits to the Cancun Frogs we had a great night. In fairness to the manager Carlos, when I spoke with him he said he felt bad. We had hardly touched our meals. At first he offered to buy me a beer, but soon got the message that want good enough. He then waived the bill. We left bitterly dissatisfied with the whole experience. Please save your money and time and look elsewhere. As for Playa Del Carmen, for the British readers, it's like. Mexican Blackpool full of tacky souvenir shops. This coupled with he pushy shop owners trying to entice you in made it an uncomfortable experience. I was offered cocaine by a shop owner."

One of them kept telling my friend that he'd carry her hammock type chair that she just bought earlier that day for $45CDN. When it came time for us to go, we left the bar and within just a 2-3 minutes realized she forgot her chair and went back inside to get it. The bartender said the guys \"took it\" and were gone already, but that they are in all the time and to come back tomorrow to get it. This went on for 4 days. It was always a different \"friend\" who had the chair and we should \"come back tomorrow\". Day after day after day, always a different story, always someone else. Pretty pathetic that they feel the need to STEAL tourists possessions and play silly games in an attempt for us to come back everyday and spend more money on drinks at the bar waiting for the return of the chair? Deplorable. One thing to note, there is a bar/pub just down the street from SF is called Carlos & Charlies and is owned by SF, all the same guys work at both places and they are straight up thieves and liars who cover for each other.

Seriously, make your own mexican food at home or go support your local Mexican restaurant instead of waisting your money in that corporate money sucker! I highly recommend that you try out some other small local place instead while in Mexico. You'll get some more authentic food and a less drunken Disney-like athmosphere (and price!)!  We went at Senor Frogs in Playa del Carmen on a Sunday afternoon, the place was half empty. There's about 20 people working the floor(clowns, photographers, etc...). You get the feeling your at a McDonald's party for adults that never got one while they were kids. Anyways, we tried 3 different meals (Burritos, enchiladas, and some kind of mixed salad), plus some appetizers(nachos with the most plain salsa I've ever had, and a fish ''ceviche'' with some fish that was already cooked; it was still warm when they served it!!). Another bad thing about SF, if you order something to drink, make sure it's not a soda. A Coca-cola tastes worst than the bubble-less and cheap pop syrup you get at McDonald's and it cost about 50 pesos. The staff is continually harassing every client around the place to make them buy more booze, or some souvenir photo in a SF dollar store frame they wanna sell you 15 bucks! Finally, if ever you decide to go anyways, and that what I wrote turns out to be true for you too, I've got a little tip; when the waiter asks you if everything was good, just be honest and say no and old 'em what we thought about there food. Our bill for 3 people came up to almost 800 pesos without tips (and we didn't even get a beer!), I paid the full amount, and the waiter came back to me with a new bill where he subtracted 2 meals from it(-300 pesos). Sometimes it's worth it to complain! Definitely number 1 on my list of things not to do in Mexico!"

When the cruise ships comes in it gets packed and it is super super fun! But the prices are super super high! We were paying $10 Canadian dollars for a Marg!I would recommend coming to Senior frogs to experience the fun for a drink or two because it is a fun place to be. But your also in Mexico and shouldn't drinks be cheaper? I mean, i don't even pay $10 for a mixed drink anywhere here in Canada! geesh! and I feel the same way about Charlies, up the road as well.We found that the Tequila barrel was a great great place to be in Playa.. It was packed with tourists and they had great deals on buckets of Corona and two for one margs! The crowd was fantastic and you were right on the main strip! It is more wallet friendly and a good time to be had for sure where a buck goes much further!"

We passed up lots of cute patio seating authentic mexican restaurants and headed down to Senior frogs. Big mistake. Yes we danced and the staff were completely trained to have fun and rack up your bill. Our party of 4 ordered 4 beers and I asked for a goblet for my beer and they brought out these senior frogs big glasses. I would estimate it was equal to 1.5 beers. One in our party ordered another smaller beer later. Then we were in the spirit and thought that maybe a tequila shot would be fun. Luckily my husband asked how much they were and the guy said 9.00. We settled on one that was 5.00. Long story short... 5 beers and 4 shots later our bills was 95.00usd not including tip!!!We all agreed this is how spring breakers get into trouble and we fell pray to there marketing scheme."

There was never a dirty/wet napkin, water spot, or empty drink on the table and the second our drinks were low they were over to ask if we wanted more. The bathrooms.. OMG THE BATHROOMS! This might sound weird but the bathrooms were crazy clean! I've never been in a club filled to capacity with bathrooms like these. The bathrooms were air conditioned (the rest of the club was not because it's an open air club), they had an active attendant keep everyone in order, little bathroom amenities, etc. Super clean, comfortable bathrooms! We were there during the New Years count down which was really fun and exciting to experience. The club put the clock up on the big screen and did a count down and then played music. The DJ was great, good music, probably the SMOOTHEST New Years night I've ever had out at a club. ZERO incidents, no idiots trying to be tough guys, just a bunch of people happy to be in a place together celebrating the new year. Also, the cow on the ceiling is weird as hell.. i like weird."

The waiter refused to give us a menue and kept on saying the bottlea start from $250. We managed to get a menue and to no surprise bottles were much cheaper listed on the menue, another sad reminder that we were in mexico. We selected a bottle pf don Julio which was one of the more expensive onea and it was listed at $200, although the waiter still wanted $250... So we order and a few minutes a bottle of Standard tequila shows up... I asked the waiter for an explanation, he tries to convince me that its a better tequila to my amazement... Again a sad reminser that we are i mexico and some people see you as walking $ bills... So back and forth with no success we decide to just drink the cheap tequila and call it a night... But our misery did not end there... The bottle turned out to be fake... And we were asked to pay $270 for it or \"else have risk our security\" needlwaa to say we paid and got out...

I belive it was a minimum spend of 200pesos per person to enjoy the facilities which wasn't a problem for the 2 of us!Chairs and loungers on the beach, hammocks and chair swings up top with full bar and cocktails; good service to boot. Happy hour was 2-1 and they had food and snacks too. Big bonus for a nice waterfront pool which i didn't notice at too many other establishments that weren't hotels. Looks like it gets pretty bumping at night too."

On the 1st day everything was nice, a bit expensive (600 pesos minimum charge for 2 chairs), but we felt it was worth it. We enjoyed our day with pretty decent food and ok drinks and when the bill came we gave a complimentary 20% tip and went on our way.Day 2 is another story all together. Still paying the 600 peso minimum for 2 chairs but the food was lacking and the drinks were very weak. When presented with our bill there was a \"mandatory\" 20% tip charge. When I inquired and told the waiter there was no \"mandatory\" tip the day before, he laughed and said \"well today is mandatory.\" I am not one to not tip, but when someone expects to be tipped at 20% for substandard service, well lets just say I WILL NOT BE BACK!!!

You pay big money for a 10 day pass already, you expect to be able to find a good spot to dance, but you probably wont, unless you are prepared to buy the spot.

A nice clean refreshing pool is a much appreciated benefit for the Blue Parrot. Food is also OUTSTANDING. Very fresh & delicious. The ONLY complaint is that there is a minimal amunt of choices on the menu & they are NOT FEXIBLE when ordering. For example we wanted a Fish Tempura taco & they said it was not on the menu..The next day we ordered the fish & chips which essentially is fish tempura & French fries --?? Strange!

Now we are in our early 40s - so we still hit it for old time sake but its a YOUNGER crowd and hot spot for the BPM festival every January in Playa. It now features a \"foam party \" dance floor in which you get sprayed with real soap suds about every 5 min. It offers a awesome pool near the back bar - if you wish to take a dip ...most people do. LOL. It has 3 bars, and 2 dance floors. The drinks are over priced and watered down - but your paying for the experience, DJ and being directly on the BEACH people! There are many clubs on the strip - this one is fun because its all outside. Cons : not much seating - so wear flat sandals that you don't mind getting wet when on the foam dance floor -lol. There is always a \"cover charge' but all clubs in playa have a cover - so...it is what it is folks! Its normally $60 per person all you can drink with a wrist band and about $100 during a festival for a well known DJ. Check it out - its fun ! They also serve food till about 10 pm in a small restaurant area and offer a motel style lodging - but the motel portion is only voted a 1 star and is SUPER NOISY....LOL. VIVA MEXICO!"

Mixed drinks were so-so, pretty weak for the price. Only recommended during happy hour, but going with beer ensures that you know what you get.They did a little trick with the bill (and they did the it on both days), they print a receipt with your items but show you a number on their calculator that is significantly higher. I asked the waiter if this included service, as I found the amount a little high, but he lied and said 'no'. So I gave him some 15% tip on top of the amount he had shown me.The next day we carefully kept track of what we had and realized that the discrepancy is 20% and is obviously a hefty, non-obvious service charge. I essentially got tricked into a 35% service charge the day before. My fault for not questioning the bill, but I don't want to be the 'nasty, suspicious tourist' - and paid for that..."

We also loved the margaritas during happy hour 2 for 1. I recommend the mint and lemonade frozen ice as well - it's really refreshing. The staff are friendly and the pool is perfect!"

They had six palapa rooms on the beach, and four rooms in the main office bldg. next to the Dragon Bar and a three bdrm. house 100 feet north of the palapas. Now granted , this was in the early 90's and Playa Del Carmen was very small, all dirt roads and small population. We stayed there three years in a row...in the 3 bdrm. house. With each year, the service was great but the surroundings got worse...a lot worse!! Hoards of Rude, obnoxious and down right unacceptable tourist's , treating the locals and seasoned travelers like \"they\" were the only ones that mattered!! Our last stay, I had a Knife pulled on me at the Dragon Bar, by a guy from Cancun, with no clue as to why he was pointing this switch blade at my crotch, I informed my wife and friends \"it's time to go\"!! We loved Playa Del Carmen.....but once the word was out about this beautiful ,quiet , sleepy little fishing village , as far as we are concerned, it has been Destroyed!!! all night parties on the beach, prices through the roof and way to many people!!"

I wished to attend more events there, but BPM is all about living in the moment, and realizing there's only one place one can be at a given time. Onto the club, a typical response with the typical reviews here, yeah it's a nice place, drinks do cost more by 10-20 pesos compared to other venues, though there's staff walking through the crowd every so often taking drink orders (and returning reasonably quick), and picking up empties. I read a review where someone mentioned Europe, which I spent a decent amount of time partying in, and one thing that drove me nuts, dancing with empties littered on the dancefloor, which Blue Parrot addresses properly. Bars on both sides of the place, so if you can't wait for the fellow (they were constantly around, I picked one and stuck with him when possible, threw him a $20 for a drink last day and told him to keep the change, should've seen how his face lit up, very thankful. Javier was his name if I recall). Line-ups for bathroom breaks to a port-a-potty left that part of the evening to be desired, but hey, not to be unexpected. The sound was good for all the nights, though during Luciano one side started to cut out. I wear earplugs, so the gauge for sound quality for me is, after a couple hours, take the plugs out for 10 minutes at a time a few times to enjoy the main acts, and if I find the sound unpleasing, I don't give it the 10 minutes, room isn't tuned to the system, plugs remain in. Sunrise was picture-esque (even more so one of the first nights, which I only saw the photo), during Luiano's set. Club thinned out after sunrise, which is always welcome for a more comfortable dancefloor experience. All in all, I'd return for non international headliner night if I was there the rest of the year. Which says a lot, as I will not attend Marco Carola next year there, or any other place/time, but there's little relevance of my interactions with him and his bunch in respect to Blue Parrot, which runs a solid establishment."

            "review": "Comsi Comsa.... Blue Parrot beach club advertisements are all over Playa del Carmen, primarily because they seem to host a lot of events, beach partys and concerts. I went there on two occasions, one was during the day to enjoy the beach club itself and the other was to see DJ Sasha at one of their events. The day time beach club is a bit underwhelming, especially if you have visited beach clubs in Europe, Vegas or the like. Now, not to compare because as we know... Europe is Europe. BUT nevertheless a beach club that presents and advertises itself in the fashion in which they do so should at the very least have a day time DJ, cool music and a totally different atmosphere. It wasnt what I was expecting, although if you just need somewhere to veg out after a long night this may be what you are looking for. On the other hand, the service is great and staff are very friendly and do the best that they can. The DJ Sasha night event, not really sure where to start. First of all the event was way over hyped by promoters who suggested that there would be between 3000-4000 people there, there were maybe 700.. not that it matters. Table service if you want it was reasonable, the purchase of two moderately priced bottles for a table. I highly recommend doing that for an event at this location as it is VERY crowded and VERY hot and you will want a place to sit down after a while. One major annoyance was the local DJ who continued to spin an hour and a half over his time and totally exhausted the crowd, not that he was bad but by 3am you kind of want to see the talent you came to see.Overall, if you are looking for a posh experience, this may not be the place for you. However, as I said, the staff are great and its not a bad place to wind down."

My new husband and I got married at Blue Parrot on April 13th, 2015 and I have to say, hands down, Blue Parrot went above and beyond our wildest dreams at making our wedding day the best day of our lives. The service was EXCEPTIONAL, the venue was INCREDIBLE and the way that they interpreted everything we wanted was beyond what we asked for. Let me also note here that we had booked at a venue just down the street (Kool Beach) who had made every mistake you could imagine, so much so that we actually canceled the venue 3 weeks before our wedding. We contacted Blue Parrot and within 3 weeks they put together what we thought was impossible. I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart the people at Blue Parrot are exceptional and really go all out with their customer service. They heard everything we said, they made all of our wishes come true and by far were the easiest people to get ahold of. They were attentive and responsive, they were timely and on the ball. They went over and above what we asked for and truly made made our wedding a night to remember not only for my husband and I but for all 50 of our guests. I have never written a review before but Blue Parrot truly deserves this review. I hope that anyone reading reading this who is looking for an incredible venue (ESPECIALLY if you are getting married), you honestly can't got wrong with this place. The food (my husband is a picky eater and we both loved the food),the venue, the atmosphere, the service, the decor...I still cannot find one fault in anything they did. Thank you Blue Parrot!! I can't wait to see you guys again on our one year anniversary!"

The music was good and easy to dance to played a lot of Spanish music too. There are a few bars and never took to long to get served. The lady in the loo was so friendly and always zipped up my Playsuit. One thing I wasn't to keen on was in the evening they did a bikini contest which the music stopped and everyone huddled round the pool.Overal had a great time here and will definitely be back when I return in November."

The strip - in the last 10 years - has changed no longer dusty and quiet but vibrant with clubs and bars lining both sides of the street, The Parrot is at the end of the street it's entrance insignificant, you are jostled by sellers trying to sell you wristbands we should have turned away! Despite the Facebook page offering 'Free Drinks' for Ladies you are still 'persuaded' to pay 25 USD admission for Free Drinks. Once inside it has the charm and personality of your garage. No pretty twinkling lights, cute swings, dancing fire eaters instead pushy staff watered down drinks and curiously a small pool ??? Empty dance floor music so loud your eardrums ring. How sad. Bring back the Partot of the past, cooler than school, beds along the beach, free entry, dancing fire eaters, haunting music stop trying to compete with the new bars you are better than that! Get rid if the intimidating entrance crowded with pushy salesmen if your club had the personality it had you would be packed with people who want a fantastic trendy beach bar - that's what you had and you are destroying your own venue :("

The nightlife at Blue Parrot is second to none. Definitely a bigger venue to fill but when a big act is in town , this is the BEST place to party.

We loved the option of lounging in the pool all day rather than the rough, sea weedy ocean.We were told that we had to order 600 pesos in food and could stay there for the day, which we did, and then some. Drinks were not very strong, but that was the only drawback."

Blue Parrott is up there with the best and a fantastic venue for listening to your favourite DJs. We went twice, once to a daytime party and once to an evening party that went on to the early hours. Both were a fantastic experience. Drinks, although more expensive than the rest of Playa, were still reasonable and compared to Ibiza were cheap! \u00a32 for a bottle of water, \u00a32 for a beer and \u00a34 for a spirit and mixer. The view of the sea is fantastic and the club attracts a real good mix of people who like to party. Security and staff are some of the nicest I have come across in a club. Security and waiters were apologetic when trying to get through the crowd and the staff behind the bar were happy, smiling and really enjoying themselves (what a difference from the likes of Pacha in Ibiza!) All the staff they have working in Blue Parrott really make this club and it is obvious they have been trained to a high standard and respect the customer \u2013 well done and keep it up. The sound system is stupidly loud, but luckily I had my ear plugs or you could dance further away from the main dance floor. However this meant you could really feel the music and this in turn made for a great atmosphere. The only downside to one of my nights were the Canadian security who were involved with the BPM Festival. I won\u2019t mark down the club because of them, but I have never met such a bunch of arrogant and condescending people in my life, complete idiots who hopefully won\u2019t be back next year. Replace them with the Mexican security from inside next year as they were far more professional and customer focused and they obviously know how to treat paying customers well and with respect."

The staff con you into paying 1000 pesos claiming you get free drinks all night. This is not the case at all! Do not believe a word they say!! 2/5 of us got 1 drink each which is ridiculous. We went to complain and spent the following 2 hours arguing with these horrendous people with horrific attitudes trying to get our money back. They refused over and over and over again. They were so unhelpful, knew they'd lied to us and stolen our money and just said they couldn't do anything. All we wanted was either what they'd promised us or our money back. We are a group of backpackers and are obviously on a budget and just want to have a good time in different parts of the world. We will not be returning here ever again. It is over priced as it is and the drinks are extremely watered down. You will spend a fortune and not even have a good night. The bar staff are no better and the whole atmosphere of the place is incredibly unenjoyable.

It is mostly (except for one small area) concrete now, and only had one dance floor in operation. The place wasn't very crowded and even by the time we left it was still pretty deserted. The old Blue Parrot was nicer, with more sand floors, more swings at the bar, and the multi-floored lounge-y building is gone :( I also liked that it used to have different dance floors with different types of music (pop area, techno area), but all that was there was loud techno. If I had never experienced the old Blue Parrot maybe I would have liked it more, however the nice Playa feel of sand, dancing and swinging by the bar is long gone. Now you sit in chairs in the middle of the concrete, can enjoy 2 swing chairs, and dance on one small concrete floor to techno. It seems like Blue Parrot tried to move toward a feel of a large techno club, but lost the appeal of being open air, right on the beach, and in downtown Playa del Carmen. I won't be back"

We got two chairs and a table on the sand, but at night they put up a barrier between the bar and the beach, so even though you are on the beach, you don't really feel like it because you cannot really see the water or beach. We wanted to pay cash for our drinks as we went, but were told that we would need to have a credit card and start a tab. What? We did open a tab and at the end of the night our bill was about what we expected but I can see how it wouldn't be hard to end up with an unpleasant surprise at the end of the night with your bill. Also, we paid a cover (I think $10 each or something like that) and drinks were fairly expensive. Two beers and a tequila shot was around $20. There are several areas within the club to party, but things don't really get going until after midnight. After our first night at Blue Parrot we didn't plan on going back but the next night we were standing outside getting a sausage sandwich from a street vendor (awesome sandwiches for just $5 btw) when our server from the Blue Parrot the night before came up to us and said we could get in with no cover this time. So we thought what the heck and went back. Had two beers and a shot of Don Julio, this time for a whopping $40! Needless to say we left after one drink. I doubt we will ever be back. There are much better choices along the beach."

The night I was there it was a bizarre Brazilian theme. What really p1ssed me off is that I asked twice (2 different staff members, one outside and one inside) when the fire show was starting and they both told me \"soon\". Clearly they lied to make sure we went in and spent some money on drinks while we waited for a fire show that was never going to happen.The new d\u00e9cor above the dance floor by the DJ booth is also very weird bordering on creepy with what look like aliens and venus flytraps hanging from the ceiling.When it came time to pay the bill the waiter leaned over and said \"Just a reminder, hon, but the tip is not included.\". Rude! I worked in the service industry for years and always tip very well. The staff there should be reminded that getting a tip is not a given and in no way is it ok to ask/demand for it.I will NEVER go there again and will make sure to let all of my friends know that there are far better options in town where they can spend their money and have some fun."

To add some context, I went here March 2013 with my 5 girlfriends and 2 guy friends. Our group of 8 was solicited outside of the Blue Parrot on 5th avenue. We had wandered here after thinking about going to Coco Bongo and deciding to skip the line and price. The ticket handlers came up to us and told us $25, all drinks included. We all bought tickets in the form of wrist bands. They gave half of us red bands, the other half green. Then the crappiness began. 1. \"Tequila\" is actually sugar water.The red banded people were allowed to get mixed drinks, while only the green banded people were allowed to get beer. We had all paid the same price and no one thought the colors of the bands meant anything. After an hour of drinking one \"mixed drink\" (mojito, margarita, etc) after another, we all felt completely sober. My girl friend and I asked the bartender to make our next drink stronger - he looked at us, poured HALF THE GLASS full of \"tequila\", all the while nodding and grinning in a \"you're gonna get sooo drunk\" way, and the drink tasted exactly the same as the previous sugar water drinks. There is NO WAY the tequila they use is pure - I doubt it's alcohol at all. 2. Waiters/bartenders shamelessly demand tips.The bartenders will barely look at you if you don't give them tips. And I'm not talking about a packed night, they don't have time or whatever. We got there at 11pm at the height of spring break and there were MAYBE 5 other people there. The bartenders stood and chatted with eachother right in front of our face, ignoring us. We gave them a few bucks in their jar. They glanced over at us and pointed to our wallets and said \"more\". After every drink that followed, they would say, \"don't forget about us at the end of the night, we gave you BEST drinks\" (false - see point 1).3. Place is DEAD. Our group went there on a Thursday night. We stayed there from 11pm - 3 or 4am. We kept waiting for the scene to pick up. Nothing. At most there were 20 people in the whole club. 4. All around sucky time. Please don't even consider going. I can't think of anything else but this place deserves to be put out of business, they blatantly rip off their customers through the bracelet all-you-can-drink deal and then simply don't put alcohol in the mixed drinks. They do this because they know people will go there once and not come back - that's why there is no one there, ever. They survive off new tourists who don't know how crappy their establishment is - do yourself and the country of Mexico a favor and let their business die a natural death of bankruptcy."

It cost you a 100 pesos to find out it's almost deserted, wille all clubs arround are crowded. A beer, that in all the bars and pubs on 5th av. will cost you 35 pesos and comes in a bottle with a part lime in it, here will cost you 40 pesos and you'll get it in a can. Not even to mention that when you pay with a 50 pesos bill, the guy behind the bar automatically assumes the 10 pesos is a tip. I'm not a cheap tipper (some day even have been called crazy for over-tipping ;-) ), but I hate it when people take tips without asking. The club exists since 1984, and according to the smell there's never done any maintenance in the toilets or sewer system. I do not want to know how it will smell during the summer when it's getting really hot."

We were recommended by locals as its the best place to party because it's on the beach, and you can party on the beach at night. This is a false truth. Part of it is on the beach, but it is boarded off. We were looking for an all inclusive drink club, and were approached by promoters outside the entrance saying girls can drink for free if the guys all pay 40$ for all you can drink. Sounds like a great deal no?We went in, no matter what we did we could not get a drink. They screwed the guys around like no tomorrow. We were told that only one part of the bar did all inclusive drinks, so we waited for a drink. Got to the bartender and he told us they didn't do the all inclusive at that part, it was at the other end of the bar. So we waited at the other end, surprise, he told us it was at the other end of the bar not there. So we waited at the other end, only to be told\" you didn't listen? i told you its at the other end of the bar\", i told him the other bartender said to go to him and he said well that's the only place we can get drinks.Now after 3 times of trying to get drinks we get a drink, i order 4 shots of tequila in a glass (ya kinda filthy but i was wanting to drink!), what do i get, a dixie cup of watered down orange juice?!So no drinks, this happened to all of us guys, and the girls got nothing but water. Asking for a vodka and 7up, got a tiny bit of vodka and water. WTF!?Now to the other part, you will get harassed for cocaine, non stop, everywhere you go in this bar. It's obvious that the management is associated with the cartel, or this would not be allowed. I mean i must have been asked if i wanted cocaine maybe 10 times in the hour we were there. The worst part? I go to the men's washroom, and as i go in 'im asked if i want cocaine, i say no gracias, i got to the urinal, while peeing, i get a guy on either side of me very close, asking me if i want cocaine, one being the one i already said no to, and the other being the bathroom attendant(useless person). I told them to get the *#&$ away from me, i was enraged. They left me alone, i go to walk out and the bathroom attendant tries to give me paper towel i said no thank-you, then he stood in front of the door asking/demanding a tip, i said no and squeezed past him. Walked out of the washroom and all my friends, 8 of us, were waiting for me a the exit. Worst bar/nightclub in playa del carmen by far."

I paid $25 for an open bar until 5am, unfortunately i had to discover while in the club, that the information i was given was completely inaccurate.

After arguing for over 20 minutes whether i heard wrong or what the policy of the club is, or the laws in Mexico i wasnt given any option....lets be honest i could had misheard what the lady who sold me the service or that actually i was misled, but the last thing i was expecting was to be told \"take it or leave it\", the whole issue could had been solved by confirming the information with her sales employees, but he was not willing to do so. I had the most amazing time at Playa del carmen's night clubs, and Blue Parrot club wasnt the exception until that night.

Awesome service, right? (again, looking back, HUGE red flag) Well, we were felling good and these cold beers couldn't get any better. 10:45PM - We powered through the first two buckets and order a second round. The buckets were at our table before our converstation was finished. We decided to take advantage of this excellent service and ask for a couple of waters. We asked, they delivered. Four luke warm bottles of water. No worries. The beer is cold. 11:00PM - First bathroom break. I was greeted by a gentlemen in the restroom asking if I was interested in some drugs. This is Mexico, didn't think anything of it and ignore the guy. Upon leaving the restroom the man wouldn't let me leave until I acknowledge his presence. That was a close call. But, I've got beer waiting at the table - I'm not too worried.11:02PM - Get back to the table...where's our beer?! Come to find out, it started raining, lightly, so the bartender decided upon himself to take our beers out of the rain. Kind of funny, but I guess he's just being nice...11:10PM - I find our beer. There's only 2 left in each bucket..odd, we didn't drink that fast. I confront the bartender about it and he replies by telling me that's the amount of beer that was in the bucket when he moved it. 11:15PM - We didn't appreciate being lied to, we asked for our tab and we'll be leaving. 11:30PM - At the least, 15 minutes later the man comes out with the tab. $140.00. 20 beers & 4 waters. We confront the man and ask how the total reached such a high number. He points to the menu, which lists the beer at $4.00 dollars. But, because we opened a tab with a credit card, there was a $2.00 surcharge for each beer? At this point, we simply say we're not paying that amount. He leaves only to come back a short time later with two large...very large mexican men. We stay strong to our word and say we're not paying that amount. He tells us that there's nothing we can do. The card's been run for the amount on the receipt. Looking at the three men, we figured there's really nothing we can do at this point. 11:45PM - Left the worst bar in Playa.

While we were on the beach we saw that it was ladies night so we went to Playa. It was a Monday night and was still hustling and bustling. We went to the Blue Parrot and got drinks for free while the boy with us had to pay so he ending up leaving and getting free drinks elsewhere and then coming back. The Blue Parrot is mainly an outdoor club, with one covering over the bar. I'm not sure if it was just because it was ladies night, but only one section of the bar would serve to the ladies. This side was very busy, and full of young girls who had never been to bars before or even drank. They said there was a single file line, and I told them that's not how a bar works. I finally got a kamikaza drink, which was decent, but probably only had about 2 shots in a full red cup. Then I got another drink from a group of girls which tasted like sugar and rum, which I ended up giving to a stranger. The dance floor is a tiny stage where you can dance which was fun. Keep in mind most of the club is made of sand, so flipflops would be preferred. We went to the bathrooms which was a very small room, and not even worth it! Blue Parrot was a fun place to start the night, but wouldn't stay there all night!"

Everything was nice before I ordered a bottle of beer, $4USD. Four dollars for only one bottle, thats is very expensive, true rip off. In New Jersey, USA, I can get a bottle of beer for only $2USD in all bars and free peanuts. In the rest of Playa, if you venture out and find a local bar that will serve you two or more bottles of beer for the same price. It is trully a great rip off which spoiled my mood for the rest of my night. I left the bar after the show. I would never go there again and will never recommend to any one to go there. This bar does not deserve for me to post a picture for them."

I cannot say its perfect and it is really good and very romantic! You get this vibe of romance, Caribe breeze and warm atmosphere! I really enjoy it every time I see it. Performance is really good and especially when it is done on the warm Caribbean night, with the sound of waves- it becomes real magic! So, if you are in Playa, please visit, the show starts I believe around 10-11pm! You will not be disappointed and will definetely enjoy every minute!"

We really enjoyed this night although the free drinks were pretty weak and there was a limited option to choose from. Fire show not to be missed though!!The second time we went there, there was no offers or shows on inside but as we enjoyed it the previous night we wanted to go just for some drinks. On arrival we asked the bouncer at the ropes (the beach area is cornered off by ropes to stop people getting in for free) if they were still open and if there was a charge to get in as it was pretty late. The bouncer seemed really off with us, he wanted 70 pesos each to get in and told us we had to walk all the way around the front on the building to get in (instead of him just letting us in under the ropes as they normally do every night). We decided to give it a miss after talking with him but as we walked off a member of staff run up to us and asked if we'd like to come in, it was free of charge tonight. We explained about the bouncer, the member of staff seemed really annoyed by this and asked us to wait while he cleared things up with the bouncer. We could hear them arguing for a few minutes and then they both walked over to us. The bouncer looked really pee'd off and was still asking for money from us, so they started arguing again... after a few more minutes the bouncer demanded ID from us all or we werent coming in (we are two couples in our late 20's). In the end he let us in but we felt uncomfortable with the constant stares all night so left after a drink.Im really not sure if I would drink here again. Fusion Bar was just up the beach from this, which also have a fire show. I found this beach bar to be much more friendly and no cost to get in."

It was good and we were close enought to feel the heat from the fires. A girl came around to collect money for the performers during the show, but oddly enough only to our table???

On top of that, the staff seems rather snooty like they work at the hotsh*t place on the beach and won't even look at you while they take your $10 per drink. Gimmie a break! This place is so full of tourists, its absolutely laughable. The highlight of the 20 minutes my wife and I spent at this establishment was looking at all the middle aged losers make a complete fool of themselves on the dance floor. Alas, even that little amusement turned from funny to sad rather quickly. We high tailed it out of there to find a place with a little more \"local appeal\".If you want an authentic playa nightlife experience, stay away from this place. If you want to order a \"moe-heetoe\" next to a group of tourists from the midwest US, that just got off their cruise ship, then head on down to the Blue Parrot."

We ended up infuriated and completely sober. The margaritas were the worst I have ever had in my entire life-- it tasted like sugar with a dash of lime juice and a spritz of tequila. We were there early which meant there were not a lot of people. We attempted to get our waiters attention so we could exchange the drinks. He failed to appear even after another waiter was told to get him. Finally we went up to the bar and returned the drinks and got beers. 5 minutes later our waiter arrived at our table. He then claimed that it wasn't his or the bars problem that the drinks tasted horrific and that becuase we did not exchange them through him, if we didn't pay he would be paying for them out of his pocket. I kindly explained that we had waited 15 minutes for him and he said he had other tables to deal with. He then disappeared for another ten minutes and came back with a round of margaritas. Not on the house. He insisted they were a different recipe. They tasted the same. He didn't care. So we forked over the money (overpriced drinks at that) and left. On our way out we passed his waiter zone. There was one table. Of two people. Laziness and disregard for the quality of service and drinks makes me warn all against this place. Oh, and the bars promotion of dishonesty and disrespect by their staff to their customers. It's a shame places like this exist. Go to Fusion instead. Fun relaxed live music good drinks."

On two occasions we were given double the beers that we ordered (normally not an issue for us Canadians) and it wasn't 2-for-1 prices. I guess they figured they would save time and bring us twice as much as we wanted, but only two of us were drinking beer so they go warm after a while. We had one round of tequila shots which came in those tiny plastic sample cups, and afterwards we figured they charged us 70 pesos each. My advise would be specific to the waiter what you order, and if you order any cocktails or shots ask them the price first. Lastly, some guy by the washroom asked me if I wanted to buy some drugs. In our two week stay in Playa with many trips into town and other bars and disco, this was the only time I was approached."

They charge a $10 per person cover at the door and we found out after we left that we were supposed to get two beers with that admission. They never told us that and someone took our beer tickets, that we didn't know they were, up as we walked in the door. We ordered three vodka and red bulls and one beer and were told the bill was $50. After we complained, he then said \"no, I'm sorry I made a mistake, it is $45\". Instead of using one can of red bull, they sent three cans to the table, as an obvious way to increase the ticket. So in review, four people, in the bar for ten minutes with one round of drinks = $85. Upon talking with other guests, we found many similar stories about visiting the Blue Parrot bar. I started going to the Blue Parrot in 1997, and it used to be a real cool place to go, but I plan on never returning. It is now a tourist trap that obviously the main goal is to gouge the patrons.

We rented the VIP terrace for our small group of 25 guests. The location was perfect for our group. We had a private bar/bartender and served plated fajitas. The food and drinks were fairly average, but the location and the service were absolutely excellent. The wedding itself was not on the beach, so it was nice to have this event right on the water. I made all the arrangements over email with Paula, the events manager. She was promt with replies and provided everything we needed (menus, contracts, etc.). They were able to meet our budget, which was about $40/person. We met Paula at the hotel a few days before the event to look at the location, the final menu, and final payment. We decided to use the free wooden furniture/chairs rather than rent fancy white ones. The free ones are just fine. They are very rustic and look great in the candlelight.Paula reserved the entire group ring-side seats at the fireshow which occurs every Friday. The only thing that I think could be improved, was that we were told the fireshow started at 10:30, so we moved everyone from our private area to the public beach area at 10:30 and the show itself did not start until after midnight which was a little hard on the old folks. But, it was definately worth the wait. The fire show is one of the highlights of my entire week in Playa.Immediately after the event, my fiance and I went to the hotel office to settle the bill. Everything was as we had agreed upon - there were no extra charges, or charges which we doubted (unlike at the actual wedding!).I would highly recommend planning an event at the Blue Parrot (there was another group celebrating the actual wedding there and it looked very nice). The planning is up to American standards in terms of response time and all charges being on the table at the beginning (another big difference from my hotel wedding!)."

Of course I have had poor experiences with hotels but this time we paid US$160 a night so our expectations were set a little higher.The reason is very simple, VERY POOR SERVICE AND TOTALLY OVERPRICED, OVERRATED. Our reservation was not respected; service is slow and they just won't care cause they are always fully booked; really loud. At our checkout they were even trying to charge $100 extra. And a very important factor, the reception and restaurant are a block away from the rooms (yes, at a different location), so every time you ask for something you can sit down and see your day go by.Believe me, it was not just me, the reception was crowded of unhappy people complaining everyday. Do yourself a favor and stay at a different, much cheaper hotel. This is absolutely not worth it."

Now they have cemented over the sand and play annoying techno music all night. I could not sleep in the evenings....Music plays extremely loud until 4 am...I had spoken to other people who stayed next door at a different hotel and said they couldn't sleep either. Between the Blue Parrot and the Pirate bar competing against each other with thier LOUD Musica don't plan on a good nights sleep. I like to party like the next person, but for some reason the city of Playa Del Carmen does not have any laws on noise control on the beach in the evening....The city fines the businesses on 5th ave for loud noise, but at the beach they seem to not care....Be very careful on this choice! Bring ear plugs! You can't find them in town!"

Victor and Carlos checked us in, studio was great. Great view of water and gardens room 213. Service was excellent. They called us every other day to see how our stay was going. We had family in 2 other rooms and they enjoyed there stay just as much as us. No problem with noise from clubs, security always on duty at hotel. Clubs were popping, location of hotel was great, walk to dinner every night. Finding NFL football was a bit of a challegne BUT we found it !!! There is a little bar next to hotel next to us that was 2 for 1 after 1p.m. they had good food and drink specials! We walk to Wal-mart that is quiet a walk about 7 blocks( taxi back for sure). We bought stuff for lunch and sodas. Went snorkling with one of the boats Capt ED. did some fishing it was okay not the season for fishing. Overall Blue Parrot was great, We will return again coming from mid aged folks too. Loved the convenience and location. We were there for Mexican Celebration of Independence that was fun too. So all you people concern about Noise from clubs and Construction - didn't effect us at all. Hats off to Blue Parrot and Staff !"

We went again on another night (I can't remember which sorry!) and it was really busy and we had an amazing night!No problem getting served at the bar and the bar staff were friendly. We went later the second time and had to pay to get in but you are then given a voucher for either one free drink or two free beers so it really works out the same anyway!As you come in there is some stone semi circle seating areas and then there are some TINY tables and chairs - think of a reception classes furniture at primary school! These are on a sand floor and infront of them is a sand dance floor, there are a few rugs laid down to dance on if you find it easier. There were also four large speakers you could dance on in this area.Behind this was a few steps up to another seating area with stylish but no so comfortable seats. This was just near the DJ booth.This area played proper dance music, we enjoyed it here even though this isn't our kind of music.There was a large bar in the middle with swings as seats round it, the novelty didn't wear thin on us we loved them! We have about a thousand pictures of me on them. lol it's like \"theres me on a swing, theres another of me on a swing, oh and thats another of me on a swing, a few more of me on a swing\" lol....The best bit of the club was the wooden dancefloor on the beach...we danced here even in the rain. The music was RnB and hip hop which I love but even though my boyfriend doesn't love it he still had one of the best nights of his life.It was crowded enough to have a great atmosphere but not so much that you couldn't dance/find a seat etc.Brilliant night out! Highly reccomended!!! Best place in Playa Del Carmen that we went to easily!"

Needless to say we love it there. There was some consturction noise, but it didn't effect our trip. The second time we stayed in the \"rear studio\" it was louder there. If you are concerned about noise, don't take that room. Otherwise, the rear studio is the best deal in Playa. Its the same as the other studio's and opens up to the same courtyard that you see on the website, except that it is the first unit as you walk into the courtyard. I thought it was worth the $50 per night savings to be only 10 feet further from the beach."

By far, this was the best place to go and party. Not only did they play great music, but the beach setting just topped things off. People were super friendly. I danced with people from all over (Israel, Italy). There were security guards all around the perimeter of the beach to ensure that clubgoers don't run off into the ocean intoxicated. However, they were the most respectful and allowed lovebirds to go about their business without any interference. If top 40 music isn't to your liking, then there is a second room that primarily played techno/house music. I never danced in there, but from watching, the room seemed like fun as well and catered perhaps to same-sex couples and gays. Overall, it was an incredible atmosphere in the club. I would most definitely go back the next time I am in Playa."

I've been to Playa many times and have stayed at the parrot when I could. Only when its booked solid have I stayed elsewhere. Other places in town where fine but as far as location, services, and entertainment go you can't beat this place.I'll be returning in September and am hoping to get a room."

            "review": "muy bueno. My husband and I just returned from a terrific week at the Blue Parrot Hotel. Our room was at the beach end of the regular hotel section (room 311 - I highly recommend it), and we absolutely loved it. It was a good size studio (with kitchenette) with charming, cozy decor, excellent air-conditoning, books on the shelf, lovely, clean bathroom, and a fantastic little patio with an exceptional view of the blue sea. The beautiful architecture of the hotel building makes for a really wonderful backdrop and great feeling in general. We never had any problem with noise from the beach bar... I'm surprised to hear that people have that problem. I just never heard it loudly. We did have a lot of banging from the next-door construction project, starting as early as 8 am and lasting all day. But we generally got up and out of our room at that time anyway, so it really never became a big problem. I could see it being one if you sleep late. We're more of the late afternoon nap types, and by then it had generally quieted. There is an enormous amount of construction going on all around the hotel, but it didn't really bother us. The beach was great (once again, lots of construction noise as they rebuilt the beach bar palapa that burned down, but what are you gonna do? It looked like they would be done with that project soon so it shouldn't be a problem much longer.) Otherwise we enjoyed the beach a ton. Drink service was good, nice music at perfect volume. Chairs are very comfortable and were always available. Nice people around us, not loud jerk types. The waves are very minimal at the beach here, and there are a number of fishing and diving boats at water's edge, so it's not quite the unspoiled ocean beach that some might be looking for (just up the beach at Shangri-La area the beach is a liitle more like that type; Tulum even more so), but the water was lovely clear blue, sand was soft and ambience beautifully relaxing. We just loved being in the middle of everything but still in a beautiful, relaxed environment.Our only real negative opinion of the Blue Parrot was the restaurant, mediocre at best with very spotty service, which was strange because service everywhere else throughout the hotel was excellent. We didn't really care, though, because it was fun to go up to the main drag for coffe/breakfast (Java Joe's and Hot Bakery were excellent), and Playa Maya restaurant just down the beach was terrific for lunch. Oh, one more thing: The guest services guy was annoying, trying to rope you into wasting some of your vacation time at some sleazy property sales pitch/time share presentation. He kept approaching us by name, and called us at our room, to try to convince us of what great free incentives he had to give us. Ugh. I can only imagine how disturbingly aggressive the sales-pitch people are at the actual presentation if the hotel guy was this bad. It just seems so crummy that they disguise it as \"Guest Services.\" The only service we got was lip service. Advice: Stay away!All in all we thought the Blue Parrot was wonderful and a very good value. We would stay there again in a heartbeat, especially in that exact room which we felt was ideal for us. The hotel is just so pretty, and the location simply can't be beat for those who like to walk around town and feel like they are part of it rather than set away at a big resort."

We booked the Suites area of the hotel thinking it would be nicer than the hotels right on the beach. To our suprise the Courtyard Studio Suite was VERY tiny and to top it off it was connected to another room, so close that we could hear EVERY word they were saying. I think they split up a large room to make the seperate bedroom a room in itself, not impressed! So we changed rooms and got a room on the beach and it was perfect!! We were literally steps from the beach, our room was the perfect size, little kitchen area, nice bathroom etc. The Suite was newly updated and the furnishings were newer but it didn't matter the room at the beach was MUCH BETTER! I like the hotel alot, it had a fun funky feel to it if you are looking for something different than an All inclusive. I would also have to mention that it is definitley for a younger crowd not for families. the Blue Parrot Bar/club is right there so that was convenient and the beach parties are the best! Also the Beach chairs are soooo wicked!! Good Guacamole in the beach restaurant/snack bar mmmmm...wish I was still there!"

Instead, we were given a kitchen with a bed in it and two bedrooms. I had to call and beg the staff for a lamp for the room. The air conditioner in my parent's room leaked on the floor constantly, an accident waiting to happen. I slipped and twisted my back in the water. The floor had to be covered in towels below the air conditoner. The jacuzzi never had water in it although the facility is only one year old. The flat screen TV in the center room never worked. I was told by a desk clerk there would be no complimentary breakfast, but the next day I asked a different clerk and was told it was served on the beach. It's just toast, coffee and juice, and if you ask for more for seven people, they bring you one piece of bread! I did not make a fuss at this place but decided I must let other people know that the managers of the Blue Parrot take their guests for granted."

From the pictures and reviews that I had gathered from the internet the hotel seemed exactly what we were looking for. When we arrived, we were placed in a second story room when I had originally requested a third story room. I had heard how noisy the joint could get and had also placed a \"follow up\" call to ensure that we had a third floor room reserved a couple of weeks prior to our arrival. Fortunatley we were only on the second floor for a night. Regardless of what floor you stay on, you hear your neighbors and the bar next door as though you were sharing one large open party house. If you want privacy, intimacy, or seclusion I would not suggest the Blue Parrot. If you want beachfront dorm style party accomodations, this is definately the spot. We also had many problems w/ hot water, room service, wake up calls, and message receipt (almost missed our Coba tour). We also had an ant problem (yuck!). The building is architectually stunning and the beachchairs are the best on the beach if you can snag one. Overall, I'd have to say the place was a big disappointment. Playa Del Carman is also incredibly expensive, I would highly recommend going all-inclusive, it really is the way to go. Check out the Gran Porto Real down the beach, it looks incredible and is also an all inclusive and the food looked amazing. We also did a thorough inspection of the Shangri La down the beach which looked SO peaceful in comparison to the B.P."

We paid extra for a beachfront studio and booked our trip through worldlinks. I called and spoke to a representative as I was struggling with choosing a place. I was going with a friend and looking for a place that was beachfront and would accomodate 2 - 3 people. The representative was helpful but I felt he was deceiving in the room description. I specifically requested a room with 2 beds. He told me the room was spacious and definitely had 2 beds. When we arrived, we discovered a relatively small room with one double sized bed in it and not much room for a spare bed. Considering that we were paying $278 a night, we expected 2 beds and more space. So unfortunately, our trip began with disappointment and the feeling of being deceived. I would not book with worldlinks again.The manager, Mercedes, was VERY accomodating and understanding. She tried to give us two rooms on the inside of the hotel for the same price. I was really pleased with how the hotel handled our disappointment. We ultimately decided to stay in the room and request an extra bed. The beachfront location was too good to give up. After beginning to unwind and get into the flow....we laughed when they brought us a blow up mattress that took up the entire floor space. They were out of cots or smaller mattresses. (We got one on the 3rd night) So..........If you want a total beachfront location and don't mind a smaller room, this is a decent place. ( We saw the rooms that are less expensive and on the inside of the hotel and they are fine but a little claustrophobic for me) The service was very good. Everyone was very receptive to any requests and tried to accomodate whatever needs we had. I agree with other reviews that it is epensive for what you get but if you stay in the beachfront units, you're paying for the location. We were steps from the beach and the water and I loved sitting on our balcony.As far as the noise, we did not have any problems with the noise from the bar. It does get packed but didn't impact us at all. The food was okay- nothing special. Overall, I'd have to say that the service was the best and if it's worth it to you to pay for a prime location, I would consider this place."

The balcony is a great place to lay around in the mornings before you head to the beach. The rooms are a nice size and they have a big bathroom. The service was pretty good too. We didn't tip the maid the first day because we were planning to just leave it all at the end of the week but our room didn't get swept that day. We left a couple of dollars daily for the rest of the week and didn't have any more problems. I think it was just our maid though, not a problem with the hotel because my in-laws left it all at the end and had no problems with their service. The waiter on the beach was happy to bring food and drinks all day too. Be sure to try the guacamole. We didn't go to the bar at night because it was too crowded but the rooms are seperated from it by another hotel so you were never bothered by the noise. Since this was my first trip to Mexico I don't really have anything to compare this hotel to, but we definitely had a good time and would love to go back."

My roomate and I, who are both 24 rented a room for 10 days for a little more than $100 a night. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated and unique. There was a kitchenette and a giant poland springs type jug of water to drink and a hammock and table and chairs on the balcony. The staff was extremely friendly but all of them did not speak English, nor did I expect them to. Please be an informed traveler and learn some common phrases before you go down, otherwise you look like an idiot to all the other intelligent tourists. There is no pool -- but it's on the ocean so who needs one?? The hotel is located RIGHT on the water and one block away from the CENTER of Fifth Avenue where everything takes place. At night the bar at the hotel is hopping and it is within walking distance of all the other hopping places at night-- Carlos N' Charlies, Senor Frogs, The Mambo Cafe, etc. I do have to say that it is a major couples spot. There are so many romantic restaurants and cafes but it also wasn't very hard to seek out the singles scene, it can be done! We had an amazing time in Playa. I recommend taking the bus to Tulum. I think it cost like $3.00 USD opposed to the private tour that picks you up at your hotel to take you there for a day trip which cost $75.00 usd. Definately do your research and don't sign up for just any offer on the street. Rental cars are cheap and the food and merchandise all over town have great prices. There are internet cafes in town as well. Playa Del Carmen is a MUST stop if you are in the Mayan Riviera, NO DOUBT!"

The one-bedrooms are big, sparkling clean, and comfy (with a wonderful bathroom and a shower big enough for two). The balconies are great, although the view could be better. The beach, however, is strewn with cigarette butts and bottle caps and there's lots of seaweed, both in the water and on the beach! If you've ever been to a real beach - or even a decent one - you'll be disappointed by the beach in town. And no, I'm not a snob. The pool is tiny but so clean you could drink the water. We loved the beach-front bar, esp. during Happy Hour (5-7 p.m.) or Ladies Night (Mondays and Thursdays, 8-11 p.m.). If you consider truly mediocre potato skins, burritos, or hamburgers to be \"outstanding international cuisine\" (as touted in the hotel's brochure), then the Blue Parrot's Restaurant is the place for you! If you're willing to spend $170+ per night on a hotel room, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. By that, I don't just mean a different hotel, but rather a different town/beach. To the north and south of Playa del Carmen there are plenty of superior beaches and hotels which offer _far_ better value for the money. I wish you good luck on your search and hope you have a great vacation! Brian"

            "review": "pretty good but noisy. Encouraged by all the good reviews, just came back from a very nice week at the BP. It's really a dreamy location and the best beach is right there. Really nice staff but, just to warn you: 1. the walls are pretty thin and you hear your neighbors the entire time, as well as the happy drunks at 4 a.m. I only had one good full night of sleep there. 2. no hairdryer in the room. Which is silly for a beach hotel. And you have to request beach towels every day from an office. Would rather pick one up right there on the beach. 3. the hotel bar on the beach is not so good. The drinks are dreadful, cocktails made with canned juice etc. 4. The hotel employee who took our reservation over the phone offered to book us a \"car\" to pick us up at the airport for $25. It turned out to be $50. On the way back, we took a cheap $6 bus from the bus station a few blocks away that took us to the Cancun airport in 1 hour.But the room was really nice (large shower for 2) and the satellite TV was welcome on rainy days. All in all, BP is right on a fantastic beach, with a diving shop so you can go snorkeling etc. Great massage on the hotel terrace by a woman from Quebec, Martine. Close also to great bars and fantastic restaurants, that are not cheap (80% of L.A. prices I would say, if not 100%... Be careful, some of them don't accept credit cards.) No time share hassle to report at the BP. We had a great time all in all and I would still recommend the place - just bring earplugs."

Because we were here in the off-season (Oct 16-20) the place wasn't quite the happenin' scene we thought it would be, but it was still one of the most popular bars in town, and it had a great atmosphere. We also really dug the fire dancing performances. The drink prices are higher than other places in town, and the normal music was American cheese, but for the location and overall ambiance it was enough to keep us coming back every night."

My wife and I just returned from a week at the Blue Parrot Inn, Playa Del Carmen. the hotel is an exceptional value and perfectly located directly on the north end of the beach. From every balcony there is a side view of the crystal blue waters of the Gulf. our room was very clean and nicely appointed. Check-in and out was painless, and so were the rates. I have noticed a couple of negative reviews of the Blue Parrot floating around the internet. They are obviously from people who stayed n the Palapas. The Palapas are very rustic (roughing - it) cabins directly facing the beach. They are very inexpensive and you get what you pay for. They seemed to be primarily for young backpackers that would like a little more privacy than a hostel would allow, so if that is not for you be sure and reserve a real room in the hotel itself. Slight warning - do not take a \"shuttle bus\" from Cancun airport to Playa - they will make you wait until they have a full bus which could take hours.Have a nice vacation - Jay Kahan"

When seeking a honeymoon destination on the Mexican Caribbean in late March of 2002, my wife and I were looking for something different from the insulative all inclusives and mega resorts that now seem to be the rule rather than the exception. We wanted something with personality-- a destination that was hip, comfortable and reflective of the local culture. Happily, we discovered the legendary \"Blue Parrot\" the funkily serene beachfront spot that started it all 20 years ago in Playa del Carmen. The accomodations cover the full range from charmingly rustic palapas to comfy studios with all the amenities just steps from the pristine beach. Wehn the sun sets on a long, lazy day of hanging on the beach, the action at the Blue Parrot's beachfront club begins. Although we were a \"couple,\" we found the on-premise nightlife to be irresistable. The energy generated by the DJ's and the good looking Euro-flavored crowd created some of the best club culture this side of Ibiza. Best of all, when we were ready to turn in, we heard nothing but blessed silence. For someplace with this much personality, service and attention to detail was very buttoned-up. From reservation to check-out, performance was seemless; maid service, dining and assistance by staff in sourcing local side trips was top notch. If you go, be sure to look up Rick Jones, the original owner and a colorful character who still lives on premise and will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Playa (and maybe take you kiteboarding if he takes a particlar shine to you!) The Blue Parrot truly was the best of all worlds--an unforgettable experience that will bring us back again and again."

So when we asked for the total bill , that was just 100 mexican pesos , my auntie gave to the waiter 500 pesos bill, and then he came back with the change of only 200 mexican pesos, so immediately we said was a mistake and after a discussion they totally deny the fact they were stealing our money, they really didn\u00b4t care, my auntie perfectly said she had just 500 pesos bills and she wanted to change it for cash cause we passed by the ATM machine before got in the club, that was really bad, and it\u00b4s unfair for all the people who works honestly in Mexico, in my view was just a bad experience, but on my family point of view they don\u00b4t want to come back to Mexico anymore.

He paid attention to details and made sure we felt safe. When a drunk girl spilled our drinks, he had refills there for us within moments, despite the club being really busy. The only negative?

We came back around 11:45 and were all immediately deaf upon entering the club. There was no talking to anyone unless you were a skilled lipreader. It was at least 30% Mexican Bachelorette Parties and 20% middle aged super drunk Mexican guys. The rest was a mix, and although we weren't particularly attracted to any of the patrons it was nice to be in a club that didn't seem filled with American tourists. The the waiters were disarmingly charming and attentive and brought us quite a few overpriced beers and tequila shots. We ended up spending most of the night dancing on the lighted up platform and getting laughed at by Mexicans. There was a large mix of pretty terrible music from all genres including terrible house music, terrible latin music, terrible pop music and terrible rap music (actually that was pretty good.) All in all, with enough tequila, it was pretty good time. But that's true of most things."

We were entertained by a body painter....a nice dance set by some couple we met in the plaza earlier in the week...overall great night.... No cover no mandatory drinks and they gave my wife a free drink...only downside is smoking is allowed in the venue...boooo I would go again...nice mix of people....from families...to locals...vacationers good crowd.."

We found our friends and ordered a few drinks. The service was good and the beer/cocktails were priced accordingly as to our location on the famous 5th Av - north of constituents. The band was playing classic rock from the 70's & 80's. The bar - open area was a littler cramped and the dance floor is rather small. Maybe enough room for 10 people - somewhat comfortably.We never saw a menu. We spent time talking with friends and enjoyed the evening's cool night weather - being in an open area. My summary for what little time I spent at Kitxen: Would I return? Yes I would to at least try the food and see what the place looks like during the day hours. World I recommend it to family & friends? Yes I would. However, the night time atmosphere is geared directly for adults only.

They were playing Queen, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Journey, The Eagles, The Rolling Stones and more great classic rock covers. We were singing along to every song, playing cards, and it was good times. Most of the seating was outdoor, and the chairs weren't super loungey, so it's not the kind of place you'll stay for hours, I wouldn't think. But overall, you'll get live music and good drinks, and I couldn't recommend a better way to spend an evening in Playa. Quite romantic feel!"

One of our friends had enough as we were trying to get our bill for quite some time and eventually had to get our bill for us at the bar. Luckily the only saving grace was the bartender who listened to us and seemed genuinely apologetic for the servers behaviour. He ended up giving us a round of tequila to try to make up for it.

Kitxen is one of those bars that if you just so happen to be walking by then its stunning simplicity and live music will surely lure you in.We visited last Thursday to find an excellent band called La Colosio playing live on stage. Drinks were cheap and the service was excellent. Its a shame they dont serve any food because we had to pop across the street to eat but as soon as we finished we returned Kitxen.getting back to the band La Colosio the lead singer was so nice. she recognised that my 6 year old daughter was having a good time and so would momentarily come to our table mid song :)also after the performance they allowed my daughter on stage, gave her a microphone and posed for photographs. thank you for this.My only regret is that we didnt visit Kitxen more often during our time in playa, but once again this charming bar has left a lasting impression on us and i cant wait to return when next in Mexico.I wish we had a kitxen here in Britain :("

But depending on which band and night it is there's a little bit of everything in genres, so the place suits whoever visits. The place has an unbelievable good atmosphere, and the staff has everything to do with it. They are kind and funny, and they instantly notice you're there.It doesn't cost anything to get in, and the prices for drinks etc are really good. So if you are looking for a cool bar you can actually sit and talk to each other in, Kitxen is the place!"

Live music starts at 7pm with a warm up band or individual and then the main band starts at 9pm. Nine means nine, which we like. Drink prices are not outrageous and our favorite waiter, Sergio, is still manning the helm. Be nice and you will be rewarded with peanuts or popcorn. Shout out to newbie Jorge, way to sweat out the second set.\u00a0Bring cash, Kitxen does not take credit cards.\u00a0O and locals will try to sell you bracelets, local homemade treats, etc. Buy them, help them out.\u00a0"

I frequent this place about 5 nights a week and it has never lets me down. It's nice to have a place close by where I feel like it's home. Everyone who works here really know how to make someone feel special and are one the hardest working crew I have ever seen. This is the kind of place where you can form some amazing friendships as well with either locals or tourists. Definitely a great mixed crowd and not as clicky as some other places. I am really surprised by the lack of reviews and suggest if you have been here, to share your experience. The band starts at 9pm, but there's always happy hour from 4-7pm. See ya later at Kitxen!"

I have visited pool parties all over from Mykonos to Miami and Vegas and was expecting to have a great time at Corolina's with my husband. We visited during October which is slow season in Mexico and while we read other reviewers saying this place was pricey no one gave specifics on what they were charging so we figured it would not be too bad since it was slow season.Wow were we wrong! It was $100 USD per person to get in and that goes for women too! Not even at the best pool parties in Vegas with famous DJs do they charge these fees to get in. They want to be a Vegas pool party so bad but they are in Mexico and will never be a Vegas or Miami pool party just a sorry imitation!!The door area was completely empty but they still would not budge on the price and would not let us at least go in and make sure there were people and good music. We paid and it was non-refundable and walked into an empty pool with the most annoying deep techno music. For the prices they charge I was expecting to see classy beautiful people but instead the crowd looked like something out of Jersey Shore. Pool is small, ugly, and completely in the shade. I give this place a few months before they drastically reduce their cover charges or shut down. In the meantime save your money and avoid this place!!"

As a Global luxury events management organisation from London specialising in the curation of bespoke events & impactful experiences for discerning corporate & private HNW clientele, we visited Coralina in order to experience the beach club first hand for upcoming events. Having visited, experienced and held a number of exclusive events at some of the top beach clubs in Europe including in Cannes, Monaco & St Tropez, we were impressed by the overall experience offered by Coralina which perfectly captures the mood, spirit and vibe of the global beach club phenomenon\u2014and delivers it well to its jet-set well presented customer base. With glamorous, fashion forward guests in mind, Coralina is a striking addition to an already spectacular destination. As Playa's new kid on the block, the club boasts a contemporary design complimented by spectacular ocean views. Catering to guests of all palettes, the club offers an array of diverse food & beverage items from which you can explore the flavours of Mexico and beyond. The music takes you on a journey of international sounds from chill-out beach music to afternoon lounging to heart-pumping dance beats, this coupled with bottle service and stylish dancers makes for a fun experience. Coralina is a not to be missed experience in Playa Del Carmen. We look forward to returning in November with our large scale corporate group. Thank you to all of the staff for making our experience a great one particularly Lourdes, Octavio, Veronica (The Shisha/Cigar lady) and Lucas who was a gentlemen :) Muchas Gracias y nos vemos pronto!

It's 250 pesos for 5 battered wings with lemon salt & peppers. Those were the worse and the most expensive wings that I've ever had. The drinks were ok and their prices were comparable to the clubs.

But I have a suggestion though: it would be very keen of you if you to change for plastic washable cups instead of disposable cups. Contamination is a big issue in Playa del Carmen so you got to consider using washable cups instead of disposable plastic ones and also consider not using straws unless the customers specifically asks for them. About the service, Anna and Jose Luis really try to give the best recommendations in both food and drinks."

The security is amazing. And the service, I'm speechless, Ana & Jose Luis, make sure you ask for them, they will make your stay here super amazing, totally willing to give recommendation, I would recommend to get a sun bed instead of a beach chair, they have a \"feet pool\" so you can take the sand off of your feet if you decide to go to the ocean instead of the pool.

I was pleasantly surprised! My quinoa bowl with veggies and tofu was super fresh and delicious. The wait staff was awesome. Very attentive and friendly. What would have been a quick stop turned into several awesome hours...oh, and they played fabulous music too! Great DJ that came on in afternoon. We had a blast. I will go back.

This is definitely the new place in Playa for the pretty and pretentious to be seen. Cabanas - check, bottle service - check, faux exclusivity with \"reserved\" signs on beds that were never used - check, gogo dancers - check, expensive chair prices - check, loud techno music - check. The beach in this area is great so I actually could have cared less about all of that silliness if the food and drinks had been worthwhile. The drinks were ok and prices about average for this type of beach club. The food however was the real letdown. I ordered a fish ceviche which is one of my favorite things to eat in Playa. The fish in the ceviche was still mostly raw and their version of ceviche is made with mayonnaise. Unfortunately, it was awful. I can't recall what my friend ordered but she didn't enjoy her meal either.Good thing that there are many options for beach clubs in Playa and something to suit every taste. This was definitely not ours!"

The seaweed invasion from last year is gone and Coralina has anything and everything you might want at the beach.This is a club. During the weekend, it can be expensive to park your butt on this stretch of sand, but it's not Mamita's ridiculous and ostentatious. My wife and I went to Coralina during the week with some friends. We're too lazy to carry chairs, so we parked on two lounges with an umbrella. There was no fee but there was a $500.00 peso minimum per person. A few drinks and some food takes care of that.The wait staff is young, energetic, polite and good looking. Most of them have sufficient English skills to get the job done for American and Canadian tourists. Food is delivered in boxes to help keep the wind blown sand and the seagulls out of your meal. The menu is eclectic and includes burgers, sandwiches and sushi. I got the spicy fish roll. It came with tuna and salmon and it was spicy. The fish was fresh the portion was large. It was delicious. I also ordered french fries. I like my fries on the crunchy side, especially compared to the Mexican standard of slightly under cooked and mushy fries. The waitress did not understand \"extra crispy\" but we worked through it. Asking for them \"cafe\" was the ticket and the shoestring fries arrived with a beautiful golden brown hue and a little snap when you bit them. Among the best fries I've had.I was also pleased to find a few good Mezcals at Coralina and my wife enjoyed the wine.The club's activity/rental booth was off to the side. A banana boat, jet ski, power board and other toys can be had for a fee. There is no pressure and the workers do not come about soliciting business. The club has music starting in the afternoon. It can be loud up by the pool, which attracts the young, muscular, bucket-of-beer crowd, but on the beach it is pleasant background noise. At one point in the afternoon, the music got a little louder and two attractive women in small bikinis and high heels danced on the wooden platforms and steps. Yet, there were no sloppy drunks, no screaming guys with backwards baseball caps and no creepy old men filming the dancers.Coralina's is a great way to spend the afternoon at the beach."

If all the cars you own cost over $250,000, if all the watches you wear cost over $20,000, if you like expensive champagne and name brand vodka by the bottle, or if you want to look like you have all this, then this is the place for you. Male and female go go dancers, in bathing suits, dancing on stands?They have beach lounge chairs and umbrella's on the beach, and day beds and tents off the beach, all with a cost, or minimum spend. Although this is on Hyatt property, it is not part of the hotel, which can be very confusing for Hyatt guests. I asked one of the Hyatt employees about the club, and she suggested I go and look around. She even walked my wife and I to the front of the club on the beach. Both my wife and I had plastic cups with about an inch of diet coke in them. When I took one step into the club (which probably had about a dozen guest total) I had two waiters jump in front of me one with his hand in my face both saying \"NO OUTSIDE DRINKS!\" I said I was a guest at the Hyatt, and we just wanted to look around. Once again \"NO OUTSIDE DRINKS, NOT EVEN WATER!\" I think this is going to turn off a lot of Hyatt guests.To sum up my opinion let me add a quote from a review on EverythingPlayaDelCarmen.com \"If you go here make sure to take your Prada and Gucci because everyone else will be wearing it. It is a place to be seen and see others. Enjoy the atmosphere here and music and if this place is too over the top then try Mamitas Beach Club.\""

One of the first bars I got to know in Playa del Carmen and since then I went there almost every night.The prices are cheap compare to other places around Playa and the place just makes you feel like you wanna stay more, there's the bottom floor where you can sit drink and there's the rooftop which is the best where you can grab a drink chill with your friends or even alone, the music is really nice, not too loud so you can have a talk as well, for smokers you can smoke upstairs and if you feel like there's also enough room to dance. I really recommend this bar I enjoyed every single time I was there."

They offer huge liters of mixed cocktails, and they seriously fill it up with liquor. This small dive bar has two floors: a sitting area and bar downstairs, and a small open rooftop lounge upstairs.I didn't see any signs regarding the free drink for 5 star TripAdvisor reviews, but then again I may not have been paying attention."

There are a lot of great restaurant around the block, so it is a natural place to end up at.It is big enough to have a party in, but also feels Mexican. There is nice mixture of clientel from all over the world.D are cheap and big (and 12 frozen shots are 100 MXN). For a Coca Cola lover (like me) this is the place to start - they, easily, serve the coldest coke (and probably beer too) in town! And this for only 20 MXN a can.On the party street a Coke (but luke warm, or watered down with ice) can cost you 65 MXN plus tip!Be aware! If you have had an early start and been keeping a good pace...you might end up visiting one of the two tattoo parlours on the street. Who knows how to explain at home why you got an itchy left butt-cheek saying 'L'Ambassade'??"

My friends and I were just walking by when we saw this place looking nice and full of people that looked like they were having a great time. We all went inside and talked to the bartender who was very welcoming and had very good English. He was really kind and answer all of our questions about all the drinks in the bar. While we decided what drink to have he was making conversation and make sure that we were having a good time. After we got off the bar we sat outside on the balcony and we were welcome by the owner and the manager of the place, this was a surprised for my friends and I he really cared to see if we were having a good time after the chat the bartender tent us with a surprised a round of shots that they were good and smooth and so very enjoyable. This was a great experience for my friends and I so different of what we were used to, everyone was very welcoming with a great service and the rush to have a good time. This was my spot for my time and in playa del Carmen and I would definitely be going back there."
