There is a souvenir shop in the area but the price relative more expensiveVisiting the Mausoleum is free of charge but a lot of strictly regulations. No short skirts or tank tops are allowed and there is high level of security check upon arrival. Day packs can be put in a safe deposit before you enter.

First I would like to tell you to go early casue the atracci\u00f3n close around 1 or 2 pm, they are very organized and even if you see a long line they pass very quick, cameras has to be left in the entrance in the beginning as not photos are allow inside of the mausoleum, when Ho chi Min is , you can pick them up right after and make photos of the beautiful surroundings, the presidential house , the summer house , the beautiful gardens is all really well preserve and beautiful, if it s summer you really want to be there before 11 am as is very hot and even if they are quiosk to buy water inside and souvenirs they are far apart. Is a Must!

There were a number of tourists around all taking photos individually and in groups. There were soldiers dressed in smart white uniforms standing at attention very much like the Buckingham palace lot do. There is a changing of the guard every half hour so that can be interesting to watch. There is a red line about 25 metres from the stairs to the musaleam. Do not cross the red line!!! Some girls went over the line just to mess with the soldiers and they politely but firmly motioned them backWe could not go in as it was closed for some reason. Not sure I would have gone in as its not my thing to view embalmed bodies but many people might want to and do.It's a nice outdoor activity and one of those tourist tick the box locations. I was glad I went, does not cost anything, and now I can say I was there ;-) I've got the photos, wrote this review and now I'm moving on.Be careful of the taxi drivers. We got ripped off by one in a green taxi. After we had travelled 200 metres, he reset the meter to 200 000 dong. Said it was a different rate that time of the day which was BS*. Then his meter spun as if he had won the Vegas lottery except it was a drain hole for my wallet if you get what I mean. It cost me 500 000 dong ($30 NZD) for a 5km ride which should have been around 30000 dong. All Vietnamese taxi drivers can thank this guy for the fact that the other twenty taxi rides I went on in Vietnam were then all with Vinasun taxi services, who are trustworthy and consistent."

Ho Chi Minh lays beautifully 'sleeping\" and he looks perfect. Absolutely worth the effort. Trouble is when you leave the mausoleum you have to walk through al the palace gardens to get out. On a very hot day this was not very pleasant but if it was cooler I would have appreciated it more. The one pillar pagoda is nearby and good for some nice photo opportunities.

If you are prepared to get up early to queue, to endure the white-coated guards blowing whistles at you for stepping out of line, and the sticky heat from so many bodies in the queue, then this is a brilliant experience. One of our highlights in Hanoi for sure. There is copious security and you have to walk right round the back of the building to find the end of the queue but to be fair it moves pretty fast, and the actual mausoleum building is heavily air conned. They instruct you to keep walking round the body at all times which means you can't really stop and look, but nonetheless the general atmosphere is amazing. Ho Chi Minh is very visible and lit up. Really reverent and stunning experience. Be respectful, cover up and don't put your hands in your pockets. I hope this tradition continues because it is very educating of Vietnamese culture even today."

As I travel I carry a huge rucksack of equipment, and a tripod. Now any professional photographer will know that the tripod, the most dangerous photographic item in the world, is not always welcome. On arriving at the Mausoleum on a Sunday night at around 8pm, there were probably around 50-100 people wandering around. It's a huge place, so that meant that there was plenty of space, no large crowds, and as a photographer plenty of opportunities. I had previously been using the camera on a tripod prior to arriving, and so they were still mounted together. I sat on the floor to change a lens with the camera pointing towards me - and away from the Mausoleum. A police officer approached - and of course we didn't speak each others language - but in effect it was clear he was saying 'no tripod'. This I know happens in some of the major tourist attractions - so I'm ok with it. I gave him the thumbs up sign, and tried to show him I was changing a lens. He became irate and started shouting in Vietnamese - which wasn't really helpful. I then translated using my phone the phrase 'Only changing camera lens' - showed him, and he shouted even more. Obviously I was getting irate myself then, as I wasn't using the tripod to take a photo - the camera was pointing at me! I then translated another message 'I am not using tripod - only changing lens' - he shouted again, and then stood behind me while I finished changing the lens, and then separated the camera from the tripod. Whilst sitting on the floor, I was able to take some photographs with the tripod next to me, a rule I always find to be crazy, but I'll always comply. As it is a tourist area, it would be good if the Police were trained a little - not specifically in languages - but how maybe they use body language to try and communicate, as there are many languages in the world - without being shouty shouty shouty. This does nothing but heighten stress. So if you have a tripod - don't bring it here. I sat and relaxed for a while - and my 'guard' stood next to me the entire time - making sure I didn't touch the tripod. Sometimes photographer seems to equal terrorist on the scale of police activity."

Security is tight and no photography is allowed within the mausoleum itself, although you an photograph outside in the grounds. I would recommend that you takes guide with you to get the full history and some explanation of his life and ideals."

I had my cellphone in my shorts and I didn't see them frisking anybody. Just make sure not to take fotos near a guard or inside. NOTE: Wear shorts to your knees or pants and regular t-shirt, not the sleeveless ones. Otherwise you wont get in. I was impressed by the nice marble inside. Also by the 4 guards around Uncle Ho. I wonder how long they can stand without moving? Unlike Chairman Mao, with Uncle Ho you really get a close-up view of him. We were in and out withing 10 minutes. I recommend the earlier you arrive, the quicker you will finish. One good thing is that if you do go late, they have provided a covered walkway to shield you from the sun.

It was still very busy and we basically shuffled around viewing his house on stilts, (where he eventually spent his last years), three old cars he used and other buildings he had lived in.

The square itself is gigantic and interesting, with a huge Vietnam flag waving over all of it. The structure is imposing and stark, very communist flavored. There are guards stationed all over the place wearing elaborate crisp white uniforms. Be sure to stay behind the yellow lines, because the guards spring into action at the slightest encroachment towards the building."

As someone who has done my research on Moscow and Pyongyang in the past, I was not in the least bit surprised when I first laid eyes on the mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh. The architecture dominates the entire flat area around the grounds of the park, with the building visible from all of the surrounding building lines.The park itself is fairly plain, merely consisting of wide communist concrete parade ways and patches of grass. On a hot day it offers absolutely no shade from the sun, which gets rather sweltering. Once one has admired the mausoleum, however, there is very little to do. Unlike in Moscow or Pyongyang, one cannot go inside the building. If a single step is taken up off the road onto the outside pavement, the chief of the security guards shouts angrily to warn you off. The grandstands too are unapproachable. I did wonder why our rickshaw driver offered to wait for us when he dropped us off, and we soon found out. The stop is worth about ten minutes, and is rather difficult to get to from the old town. As a result, I found myself disappointed."

We busted the presidential compound and the museum. Some really interesting information on his life and the birth of modern Vietnam. Probably spent about 2.5hrs wandering around. All very well organised. From here you can walk to the lake and the Pagoda no trouble."

Once inside the Mausoleum, you cannot dwell. You keep on shuttling and have about 15 seconds of glimpse of the embalmed body. The face looks like a wax figure but very well preserved. There is no picture taking inside. You can catch the changing of the guards. You may have to check (store) larger cameras. I think this portion is free. Once outside, you can take your time to tour the presidential palace (which requires an admission) and simple bed and room HCM used to sleep. We were told by the guide that HCM was never married (so he could focus on his country), and that he died (in 1969) before seeing unification. HCM is declared a Saint by the Communist Party."

You have to go to this super early b/c many tour groups arrive and you have to wait in line to enter the Masuoleum. You need to purchase tickets (cheap) and leave your bags after clearing security. They allow only groups of people who're not part of tours to enter the property (there's a separate line-up for tour groups) and then walk in rows of 2. NO cell phones/cameras allowed so keep them inside your pocket otherwise you have to leave them at a checkpoint. After walking along with instructions, you enter the Mausoleum in files of 2 inside at a slow pace and the guards there will instruct you to walk along to keep the line going. There he is, lying in the center with 6 guards in position watching you and guarding the body in a glass cage. Lots of locals visit so definitely go early. Also, there is a dress code; you have to cover your shoulders out of respect in your attire; no tank-tops or tube tops. You don't want to disappoint yourself for not wearing appropriate attire. Also, that whole area has very strict entrance and exit; it's hard to get around the property easily. Also, tour groups and your own enter at two separate locations so be sure the taxi drops you off at the right one."

I saw quite a lot of local people visiting and paid their respect to Ho Chi Minh and that was honourable. It got quite a strict entry rule : no shorts, no tank tops visible shoulder, no camera, no water. And even stricter one inside the mausoleum : no loud talks, no walking outside the carpet, no stopping. But that's what made it a solemn visit. A bit disappointed that the staffs at the front gate couldn't see that we don't understand Vietnamese, but still blurted out orders in Vietnamese. On our day of visit, it was drizzling and the staff either told us to keep moving (because we stopped to wait for the rest of the group) or any other, because it was drizzling. But we were lucky and there were not much queue that day, we didn't stop until we reach the mausoleum. And even luckier, the entrance to the mausoleum is in form of stairs and one of our group members was in wheelchair. Since the mausoleum is guarded by guards, they were kind enough to carry the wheelchair (like some VIP guest) up. Afterwards, it was a tour to visit the gardens and residence of Ho Chi Minh, it was quite normal. Make sure to take a picture of the mausoleum structure once you're outside."

The entrance of the mausoleum is in the southwest corner (at the corner where Le Hong Phong meets Ngoc Ha) but the queue stretches northward along Ngoc Ha. 3. Don't bring bottles of drink, since you can't carry them in. If you have a large bag, they will ask you to store it at the lockers. Small handbags are OK to carry in. You are not allowed to use phones or cameras in or before the Mausoleum but you can take photos after you exit the mausoleum.4. The mausoleum is air conditioned, which is a respite from the Hanoi heat. The corpse is dimly lit and is guarded by four soldiers. If you get the timing right, you will see a changing of the guard."

When we asked how, we were given several different answers which ended in us both being rather frustrated and unsettling as our bags contained our passport. Turns out we had to walk all the way back around 2 blocks to get back to the entrance to collect our stuff, which no one told us when we checked out bags in. Luckily for us there were 2 guys from Northern Europe who were in the same boat as us and we eventually all found our way back to collect our bags.Seeing Ho Chi Minh's preserved body was interesting, he looks a little like a rubber chicken. He is very heavily guarded by security guards that are paced out every 5 metres or so. There are very strict rules you must cover your shoulders and knees before entering into the Mausoleum and must walk in 2 lines side by side, no arms folded across your chest and no holding hands. Would recommend seeing it as it was very interesting but once you've seen it you probably don't need to go back again."

All that lining up and it's a circular walk and your out of there. After this you can see the grounds of Ho Chi Minh palace, his cars, and other smaller houses he chose to live in through out his life. You really need an informative guide to tell you the history.

(Disclaimer: I went mid-morning, on a Saturday, during the Vietnamese school holidays - not a good idea!)I arrived at about 9.30 to find thousands of people in a huge, snaking queue out in the sun. I joined the line, not wanting to miss out, but I really regret it.The kilometres-long line (no exaggeration) moved decently quickly, but it was still about an hour until I got to enter the mausoleum. Bring a hat and sunscreen.You need to deposit any bags and cameras before entering the mausoleum - the signage is very clear and you don't really lose any progress in the line. It is free of charge.Seeing Ho Chi Minh was pretty cool, although you're whisked along very quickly, so you spend less than a minute in the mausoleum itself. You enter the room in two lines, and the left line gets a better view, so aim to be in that one.After exiting the mausoleum, you end up in a park area (forgive my ignorance; I don't know what it's called or what its purpose is). A long pathway leads you through the park, souvenir shops, cafes, etc. After about a kilometre you may reunite with your bag +/- camera!Overall, it was an ok experience. I definitely recommend going early in the morning (apparently it opens at 8am), on a weekday, when it's not the school holidays.P.S. Don't believe Wikipedia when it says to wear long pants/trousers! Barely anyone wore long pants. I did wear them and sweated so much! Just dress sensibly with shorts/skirt at knee level and shoulders covered."

However, after quickly passing through the security check, the queue moved pretty quickly and we enjoyed the whole experience in about 30 minutes. Cameras (SLRs etc.) must be placed in a special bag at security check and then handed in just before the queue enters the mausoleum - you get them back immediately as you exit the mausoleum; camera phones were not collected in (but you are not allowed to take photos inside). Shorts seemed OK, but shoulders must be covered and hats and sunglasses removed as enter the mausoleum.The opening times remain a mystery to me (the queue seemed to close at 1030 am?), but getting there early in the morning (pre 10 am) worked for us!

In visiting the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, I knew little of this revered national hero and his impact on Vietnam. After visiting the site including the homes and museum, I had a better understanding of his role in Vietnam's long history. This is a 'must see' for many of this country's citizens. School children arrive by the busloads, older folks, tour groups, et al, visit between 7:00 am and 10:30 am (yes, very limited hours) to see the mausoleum and surrounding grounds. The wait can be as long as an hour or so with a long winding line in the morning heat. Other reviews can give the detail of walking into the mausoleum and the protocol (be quiet, no hats or sunglasses - AND NO PHOTOGRAPHY!). Be respectful of their customs, rules and laws. Remember this is a communist country. Would I visit again? Probably not. Is it a must see? Yes, if you read the background and get an understanding of what you will see and experience.

The Vietnamese people love Ho Chi Minh ....... but not enough to honor his wishes that he be cremated and his ashes scattered over the countryside of Vietnam. Viewing Ho Chi Minh is a rigidly controlled experience. Guards line people up two by two and people are not allowed to stop walking when viewing Ho Chi Minh. One man walked in clasping his hands in front of him and he was immediately told to put his hands by his side. People musn't touch each other while walking through the mausoleum. No talking of course, not even whispering. Nothing can be carried into the mausoleum. The line of people walk into the mausoleum, along one wall and then across the front of the Mausoleum. Turning their head to the left they can then see the emblamed Ho. There is a light that illuminates Ho. Behind Ho, the wall looks to be dark brown marble. On one half of the wall is a big yellow star and on the other half of the wall is a hammer and sickle, all done in marble. It looks very dignified. Be careful of opening hours - sometimes they are restricted. Also be aware that Vietnam sends Ho Chi Minh to Russia somewhere around September - November each year for re-embalming. So he isn't there during those months. It is worth visiting the mausoleum just to experience the rigid conditions of entry as the viewing of Ho is extremely short. Most interesting is how the Vietnamese people love Ho and to see their reaction and reverence was more interesting then Ho himself.Don't forget the museum , it free to wonder through and also you can see the one pillar pagoda and presidential palace here too."

The granite tomb is impressive but sadly no pictures allowed. Once inside you file past his body in silent single file; it's eery and weird! He looks in AMAZINGLY good shape. I visited Lenin's mausoleum in Red Square once and Lenin was wrinkly and did look every bit a mummified corpse. When home I got to looking the subject up. There are theories abound that what we're looking at isn't the real McCoy and that the real Uncle Ho is in a secret location somewhere else. In my humble opinion he looks like a wax work. Judge for yourself....The grounds are pretty and you can wander around looking at his small residence from the outside. Some great old cars to see.

There are guards all over the place, and they do not tolerate shenanigans. Only take pictures when they say it is okay, don't shout (raised voices or excessive laughter will get you kicked out) and make sure to dress appropriately. Men- long shorts or pants, no sleeveless shirts. Women- Long skirts or pants, no shoulders or cleavage. Do NOT take your camera out when you are inside the mausoleum!!! Ho Chi Minh's preserved body is inside, and pictures are prohibited. On Sundays, the mausoleum is free, but this means it is very crowded. People from all over Vietnam will be visiting on Sundays, so that means you may run into some people who have never encountered Western people before (white people). When we went, it began to get a bit uncomfortable, as we were being grabbed to take pictures, my hair was being grabbed (as it is blonde), and we were crowed around for photos with or without permission. It is best to just smile and nod and be respectful even though your personal space may be invaded a bit."

You can enter the gardens and museum separately and avoid the queues or it's a natural progression to do all three at the same time.First, the queue. There is no avoiding this unless you get there hours before the opening time, so come prepared to line up. Tip: The queue is divided into two lines - pick the one next to the wall as this is the side nearest the body in the mausoleum. It also gives you the opportunity to perch on something when the queue is stalled. When we were there, the gates opened at 8.30. We arrived at 7.50 and the queue was already hundreds of people long. It's very ordered and moves quite swiftly once the gates open. We queued for just over an hour. You'll swelter in the heat, so dress for the weather (and modestly if you're intending to enter the mausoleum - see the dress rules). There are lots of local sellers going along the queue offering you the chance to purchase fans, trinkets and bottled water. Don't worry about buying souvenirs,. there's some good shops inside the complex selling reasonably priced and interesting items. Definitely buy a fan - I'm now the proud owner of a Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum style that was very efficient as I slowly melted in the humidity. The locals are very friendly and curious; we had our photos taken with various people we met in the queue and were the object of much interest from the children. I'm sure they will now grow up convinced that at least some westerners are wet and slippery like eels due to my complete inability to handle the heat. Once you're through the gates, you pass through security and must hand over any camera equipment, including phones and ipads. The item will be placed in an official bag and you'll receive a numbered tag that you hand in when you leave the mausoleum area. You won't need to do this if you're only visiting the gardens.The queue keeps moving - you must not stop or pause as you move through the mausoleum. The body of Ho Chi Minh is displayed in a sunken section in the middle of the mausoleum (blessedly air conditioned) so it's easy to see, especially if you're the height or taller of the average westerner. Exiting the mausoleum you can collect your camera gear and proceed around the gardens to the museum. Everything is clearly marked -there's no charge for the mausoleum but there is a charge for part of the gardens though some people appeared to walk straight through. We couldn't figure this out. The gardens of the Presidential Palace are lovely, with Koi ponds and a variety of plants and trees from all over Vietnam. The Museum is of interest as is the Treehouse which is surprisingly chic. By the end of your visit grab some freshly squeezed sugarcane juice and sit under a fan to cool down, then buy some souvenirs in one of the many shops. Despite the queues and the heat (did I mention the heat?), we felt this was a terrific experience. Probably not recommended if you have small children unless they're weirdly patient. Arrive early, check the dress code and opening times, obey the security and make a bunch of new friends!"

His name also brings back memories of the 1960/70s: the demonstrations, the horror of war, the victory of the Vietnamese people. This visit is rather underwhelming. It is an efficiently run affair, no waiting, it all runs smoothly (at least it did this Saturday 21 May 2016, two day after the commemoration, one day before elections in Viet Nam and two days before the historic visit by Obama. Once in the mausoleum, people are hushed to pay due respect, and one files in a never stopping line along the body of this great leader of modern Viet Nam. It is a bit of a Madame Arthur's experience, he looks rather waxed in the dim light, and his hands seem very small. So while in physical terms it is not a very exciting stay, it has a lot of value in that it gives food for thought. The nearby park with his house etc makes up a nice complement to this more macabre attraction. No pictures allowed!"

Student groups from kindergarten to high school throng the mausoleum on weekends, and we only found out later that the huge weekend crowd likely came from other provinces outside Hanoi. Water, paper fans and humour/patience are good-to-haves. We started queuing at 740am and only completed the whole experience at 11am. The crowd on our day was 95% local and you simply need to have an excess of humour/patience, as there were lots of queue cutting and jostling, and no one seems too bothered with private space (the guy behind was constantly stepping on my shoes and breathing down my neck). Logistics were not well handled, I had the security personnel shouting and pushing us physically in two files, which obviously no one seemed to observe or care, and of which a proper queue management system with barriers would have 90% solved.Anything larger than a small sling bag must be stored at the luggage storage counter, which obviously adds on to the already considerable hassle, so I definitely recommend going light.Funny thing was, after queuing for nearly 2.5h to get to the entrance of the mausoleum, I saw a tour group of elderly caucasian tourists walking straight in after presenting a wreath of flowers, hence bypassing the crowd and heat. Normally I wouldn't have mind such \"priority queues\" for \"privileged\" people (after all in many place you can pay a due to join the express foreigner queue), but I put myself in the shoes of the locals and wonder how they might feel about foreigners' privileges at visiting their own leader. This did not feel quite right, we were not exactly at Disneyland with express lanes. Moreover, the caucasian tourists were happily snapping away with their cameras right in front of the mausoleum. And I thought cameras were strictly forbidden???All in all a very average experience logistically, but I am impressed by how the locals came in forces to pay their respects to their leader. Not quite the same sombre and peaceful experience I had at Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow some years ago, so I would say come join the crowd only if you like mausoleum visits, and be prepared for the long queue."

It was just impressive to see the immensity of the grounds the city has dedicated to the mausoleum. We got to see the guards change which was cool. There's enough other main sites near the mausoleum that it can easily be fit into an itinerary. Just a note, if you're going to take a cab from here to you next destination, make sure it's one of the cheaper ones. The cabs in Hanoi charge vastly different rates and I got the sense that the more expensive ones hang out at this location (we learned the hard way). Would be worth walking a block or two to find a more affordable fare."

The visiting hours are quite short everyday and so there are long queue for both Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum and The Presidential Palace cum Ho Chi Minh's House everyday. They do not open on Monday and Friday. There are student groups and tour groups queueing for the two different attraction everyday. For free & easy traveller, it can be very confusing and the soldiers do not speak English and so help is limited. Some suggestion: 1) Go early before opening time 2) The 2 attractions are at the Ba Dinh square and there are two different queues for the two attraction. it is very crowded and so take note of people jumping queue 3) Bring small bags because they will do security scan 4) No bermudas and slippers allowed. Wear decent 5) forget about going on sat and sun. the queue is too long 6) If you want to visit both attraction, queue for Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum first because the queue is longer. 7) Tell the taxi driver to stop at the area for the queue because Ba Dinh square is quite big and you may have to walk a long way to the queueing area if he stop at other side of the square. 8) Tell the hotel to write the attraction in vietnamese so that you can show it to the soldiers to check which queue for which attraction."

An interesting and immaculately kept place, let down for me (as a western tourist) by the strictly enforced military discipline.We went as part of a Chinese coach tour, and upon arriving we were told to leave any bags or water bottles on the coach. Having been escorted into the grounds by our tour guide for a brief walk around outside the mausoleum, we then had to leave the site, and join a long queue to go through airport style security to re-enter the site when it opened properly at 8:00am. Eventually arriving at the security check I was told that the small camera in my pocket wouldn't be allowed in, and had to be given to our tour guide - which is bizarre, as mobiles which all contain cameras nowadays were allowed.Having got through security you are strictly shepherded into two lines as you walk through covered walkways to the mausoleum.Bearing in mind that the temperature was by now in the mid-30s (centigrade), and we hadn't been allowed any water for well over an hour, I wasn't happy. I'm sure this kind of enforced mass dehydration of tourists wouldn't be acceptable in the west.Upon approaching the mausoleum any hats must be removed. Inside was thankfully heavily air conditioned, and pleasantly cool.You are watched closely by Vietnamese soldiers in white dress uniforms, and any talking or signs of levity are quickly suppressed.Ho himself is inside a glass case in a pit surrounded by four more soldiers, all in a strange orange glow.The two lines move quickly around three sides of the room, down the stairs and back into the hot sunshine.After a tour around Ho's garage, office and house on stilts, we were at last allowed out into the gift shop area, which thankfully sold large quantities of cold bottled water.In interesting, but not particularly pleasant experience."

The queues on the weekend are very long but seemed to move at a good pace. We deceided not to view Ho Chi Minh and instead strolled through the gardens and surrounding areas including the Former President's house on stilts where he lived from 1958 - 1969.The house overlooks a medium size lake filled with goldfish. He never lived in the Grand Presidents home.Also in the area is the small but iconic One Pillar Pagoda. The area is very safe and serviced well with police, soldiers and other men in uniform. You can spend up to two hours here enjoying the atmosphere. Just a short walk away lies one of the oldest sights in Hanoi, The Temple of Literature, called Van Mieu in Vietnamese. The \"temple\" was founded in 1070 by Emperor Ly Thanh Tong, and is dedicated to the Chinese philosopher Confucius. Six years later, Vietnam's first university was founded here to teach the children of royalty and aristocracy.The long narrow temple complex consists of a sequence of five courtyards divided by walls.The first two courts are basically gardens with mature trees providing shady surroundings while the high temple walls help to subdue the constant noise of the streets surrounding the temple on three sides.The third courtyard is mostly taken up by a large pond, called the \"well of heavenly clarity.Beyond the well of heavenly clarity is the courtyard of the sage sanctuaryThis paved courtyard is lined with buildings on three sides. Directly facing you as you enter the courtyard from the previous one is the Great House of Ceremonies, which houses a large red lacquered statue of Confucius. The buildings that flank the Great House. The last courtyard is the Thai Hoc, holding some of the largest structures. Flanking the large two story main hall are a drum and bell tower."

To collect yr bag you have to walk all the way around the mausoleum at least 600 meters back from the exit to get it so best not to take one . We took out camera with us all the way but just put it in our pocket when we got closer to it. You are supposed to hand it in but it wasn't a drama to have it in our pockets .

It did give us a little more of an insight into the history of this very beautiful but complex land. The architecture of the presidential palace is glorious and is absolutely polar opposite to the private homes of Ho Chi Min which is comparison were absolutely frugal. The grounds are beautiful and the guards changing every hour was quite a spectacle. We didnt actually get to go inside as it was a Friday, i would like to next time we are in Hanoi."

I strolled all my way from my hostel at the Old Quarters to visit the Citadel, the West Lake, the Military Museum and the Ho Chi Minh Presidential Palace Historical site and it was a waste that I missed the viewing of one of the greatest and most respectable revolutionary leaders of South East Asia. So, if you are keen to view his body, don't come on Monday and Friday when the mausoleum is closed for viewing. Nevertheless, I still had the opportunity to take a photograph at the front of the mausoleum with the background of the white uniformed officers standing solemnly and smartly on guard at the place. I also went to the rear of the mausoleum to visit the small little Botanical Garden and the Ho Chi Minh museum. It is fun wandering around looking at the slow march of the guards and watching the visitors taking photo at Ba Dinh Square. I had visited Mao's Mausoleum in Beijing few years back and it was a tiring long queue. No luggage or camera is permitted in the viewing hall. I believe the same procedure applies here.Ho Chi Minh is a great revolutionary hero who led his people valiantly against French Colonialism and US imperialism. The French were in Vietnam to exploit the resources and in defense of Democracy, the US dumped millions of deadly bombs into Vietnam and transformed the battlefields into killing mines. No nation had ever undergone such tumultuous times for independence and suffered such catastrophic damages and intense misery that Vietnam had gone through. Yet, Vietnam survived and emerged a victorious and united country. The credit goes to this man - Ho Chi Minh. While I am not a supporter of communism, I respect this man and his contribution cannot be denied in the history of mankind. in the relentless struggle against colonialism by the Western powers, he made all Asians proud. My salute to him! Uncle Ho, may your spirit now rest in peace."

Vietnamese people are expected to visit here at least once in their life.The mausoleum is a stand alone building containing just his embalmed body in a showcase, looking like something in Madame Tussauds. Getting to see it (which takes literally 20 seconds before you are out again) is a mammoth exercise. It is only open a few hours a day, closed 2 days a week, and for 2 months a year he is shipped off to Moscow for maintenance. The crowds are monstrous, with no indication of which long queue to join. It will normally take at least an hour in the queue, even if you get there well before the 8am opening time.Most tour groups will not take the time to queue, so probably few westerners actually get to do the actual walk past the body.

After queing for 70 minutes we filtered through the mausoleum centre in two neat lines to view the perfectly preserved body of their beloved leader in a glass casket. This was a bit strange but interesting none the least. After filtering outside you then pay a small charge to enter the palace grounds and have a free guide service through the grounds and parks around this auspcious site. Worth a visit as you get to understand a little more about the Vietnamese culture and their respect for their long term leader."

The entire complex is spick and span. Though the tourists' number is usually large, the staff maintain order and discipline to ensure the viewing is done without hassle. Inside the mausoleum late Ho Chi Minh's embalmed body is kept in a chamber controlled at certain temperature so that the body preservation is not affected. The body looks life like. Close to the mausoleum one can see the old presidential palace, that was once used by the French Governor General, and Ho Chi Minh's two homes, both very modest for a head of state."

It was a fascinating experience.No pictures are allowed inside of the Mausoleum and you must take off your hat as a sign of respect.As you leave the Mausoleum, have the chance to walk by a garage which has some of Ho Chi MInh's old cars on display. The, as you continue walking, you have an opportunity to walk by the structure where Ho Chi Minh worked and lived in his later years, the building where he lived just before he died and the building where he died (when he had maximum medical assistance).The entire area is well maintained and there is a beautiful lake."

Before you go, make sure you have read even just a small paragraph about Ho Chi Minh. Hell I will tell you the little I know. Uncle Ho wanted to be cremated and have his ashes spread across Vietnam (kind of as a giant gesture of Vietnamese unity). After he died, they decided instead to embalm him and place him in possibly the coldest ugliest building you will ever come across. It is rumored the (wannabe Lincoln mimic) building is representative of a lotus flower. We had fun trying to imagine how! Why I recommend the trip is because once you have been marched into the mausoleum, silently walked around the body and marched right back out you will feel genuinely disturbed.

It is ideal to go on a tour to these sightseeing highlights as often an English explanation is not provided. This can be viewed and photos completedIn around 15 minutes. Combine this also with a self guided trip around the city using a sight seeing guide to glean the history."

However we were on a city tour and this was on the list and I'm very glad we went. I would highly recommend doing this with a guide as ours knew where to get the driver to drop us off, where to get into the queue and then for the hour that we had to queue he told us about Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi and all sorts of interesting info. He also got us talking to a school group in front of us so they could practice their English and then he translated what they were saying. The wait time in the queue went by very fast and was an experience in itself. Viewing Ho Chi Minh was interesting and it meant so much more as we had been told a lot about him beforehand. The queue is marched through and past the body very fast - that's how they get so many people through in the 3 hours it's open - and there is no photography allowed. Highly recommended with a guide!"

The line moves at 7.30am but the mausoleum opens at 8am. We were right behind the guards and first in. Then the path takes you out and into the Presidential Palace, Ho's homes and car garage and Ho Chi Minh Museum. The Mausoleum itself is a sombre affair and represents the respect the people have for their leader. We arrived at 7.20am and were through about 8.15am - you get 30 seconds in the actual chamber - if you stop you get moved on."

Cameras nor ipad is not allowed and if the security detects it you will have to leave it with the security. The day we went, there was a Chinese lady who kept taking pictures with her mobile phone. A security guard walked passed her many times as a warning gesture but she kept doing until he had to give an order for her to stop and turned off her phone. You will not have more than a few minutes with Uncle Ho. So if you had no idea of what this great man had done for his beloved country, you might think it is a waste of time.

Do not miss the optional guided tour in the beautiful park, originally belonging to the French colonial governor's palace, where (according to the official legend) Ho Chi Minh spent his last years in a simple stilted house. Even though you might not agree with the views of Uncle Ho and his successors, it is still one of those experiences, where you will sense the wings of history. Do take note that Uncle Ho is absent a couple of months every autumn due to renovation of his remains.

What was interesting was seeing how many people came to stand in line, he is much loved. So move over Disneyland this line wins hands down."

Bags are not allowed. there is a line indicating that from there pictures are not allowed. Soldiers in white uniforms organize everything. While 'normal people' line up, other groups (sometimes in uniform) line up on the square. Finally people enter, in two lines, the mausoleum itself. After taking some stairs one reaches the inner part where again soldiers in white uniforms guard the body of Ho Chi Minh and arrange some speed. His body is surrounded by glass. At the exit people head for the Ho Vhi Minh Complex. One has to pay entrance. In this complex various houses where Ho Chi Minh worked and lived without luxury can be visited. Leaving this complex one can see how far the line reaches. Those standing there, among them many children, will certainly have one or more hours to wait before paying their respect.

On entry security is very tight so I would say don't take a large bag as it takes longer. I took my camera, which is a large Canon and they take them off you. It's safe and secure, you just have to check it in a special camera bag (supplied). The masoleum from the outside is a large square pillared structure which is quite plain. Apparently can withstand an earthquake measuring 7 on the richter scale with no issues. It is heavily guarded by Vietnamese military in white dress suits. Remember to stay silent once you go inside. You are directed through a chamber when Ho Chi Minh lies in a glass coffin. I wasn't expecting that. He is flanked by four guards and there are other guards surrounding the path tourists follow. I find it difficult to express what I felt in words but it was an honour to see him. It looks like he is lying there sleeping and he could wake up any moment. The atmosphere is charged with emotion and it is truly a magicial experience. I honestly could've sat there and watched him for hours. (They don't let you btw.) What charisma Ho Chi Minh had in life has followed him into death, holding the room and the watchers spellbound as they silently file past his coffin, decades after he died."

Well maintained expansive grounds cover the whole complex which comprises museums as well as this mausoleum.However it is all over the top as the white uniformed military control the visiting public with a military approach to an extent that it is unnecessary but not overbearing so as to impact but not spoil the purpose of your visit here.Very much worth a visit.Easily accessible by taxi to and from the site with cost from Top end of Old Quarter around vnd50,000 but return was twice as much - both with metered taxi (no surprise).Care, check times on website as closes early in day."

Seeing the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh was unique and shows the respect Vietnamese people still have for what he achieved. As such make sure you dress appropriately and sorry to say no cameras are allowed. Also the armed guards (dressed completely in white) stand out, but be respectful and mindful when taking pictures of them. The mausoleum does get busy (especially in the later morning) and is closed Mondays and Fridays. Interesting to architecture and history enthusiasts.

Ba Dinh Square itself is enormous and is for foot traffic only. The Mausoleum is well protected with special guards from the Army looking after Ho Chi Mnh in perpetuity. In fact, if you stray onto the well-manicured lawns adjacent to take a photo, you will be ushered away. Unfortunately I cannot offer you an opinion of the interior as our tour group showed poor planning and arrived after the 3PM closing time.Bu if you do only have time for a quick look, it is a great venue for a photo stop."

The place is generally crowded and long lines are expected. However the lines move on quickly and you shall be done within 30 minuted. It might take some more time to visit the palace, the one pillar pagoda and the museum all of which are in the same compound. Also note that you need to be appropriately dressed to visit him, avoid skirts, shorts otherwise you will be asked to cover the same. At the start of the line you shall be asked to deposits your bags (free of cost) and later on as you move in the line you will also be asked to deposit your cameras (free of cost) however i guess you may pay and carry the same. Taking photograph of the body is strictly prohibited, you make take pictures outside. The guards do not allow any sort of talking or giggling and also make sure to switch off your phone ringer and hands have to be kept out of your pockets when inside the mausoleum. It was really interesting to see him lying in a dimly lit room, the body is well preserved. The museum is closed between October to January as the body goes to Russia for preservation and restoration. Further if you wan to visit the palace and the stilt house you need to pay around 40,000 VND per person and another 40,000 VND for the Museum. The palace can be seen only from the outside, and yes do not forget to check out the cars in the garage next to the palace. The one pillar pagoda (free to visit) is also there however nothing extra ordinary and might be seen from distance.It is definitely a must go when in Hanoi."

There are very strict rules that must be obeyed and soldiers in attendance will enforce them. No cameras, smart phones or video recorders are allowed inside and there is a strict dress code. Another was the number of armed guards policing the strict rules regarding silence (particularly no laughing)The Botanical gardens are full of a variety of plants and trees and again with a guide you my get to understand all the different species and significances, whilst also learning about his life and revolutionary activities. The Palace looks as if it is brand new and is still used today. This used to be the residence of the Governor of Indochina and after 1954 it was named the Presidential Palace and became the place where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked until he passed away in1969."

We were told that he is regularly sent there for a touch up. Anyway, we got to see the outside and grounds from afar, as we were not even allowed up the steps that lead to the building. It is an impressive structure, despite being voted the sixth most ugliest building in the world in 2012. Due to it being closed we spent our time in the Ho Chi Minh Museum next door. Both buildings are included in the one entrance fee. A quick tip - the guards look great in their white dress uniforms, but they didn't dress up for fun; they are serious about their job."

Ho Chi Minh avoided the pomp of the former French Gov Gen's palace for more modest, sparsely furnished digs on the estate - well worth seeing to get a sense of his austere preferences. Other interesting aspects of these imposing grounds: bunkers, special hospital for his later days, a palm tree he planted in a huge deciduous tree as a symbol to represent surviving the bombings (palm tree lives, Viet Nam lives)."

After a couple of stairs you walk around the glass coffin with HCMs well preserved body in it. No photos are allowed and you cannot linger there. Whole thing is over in less than a minute.

Don't bring a big purse or backpack unless you don't mind checking it in and picking it up in another location. They transport all bags on vehicle to another bldg. I personally had a small pouch with contents of phone, cards, money hung around neck and I was fine.Big cameras will be asked to check in.You can take pictures of grounds and huge flag after you leave the building. So I had my Android phone.Upon entering his presence, you will be asked to remove your ball cap, or hat. You can't enter in shorts or tank tops. Basically be smart, dress covered and be respectful.It's as if you would do the same in another country or entering a temple/wat.I enjoyed that the country have respect and it is done orderly.The grounds surrounding the Mausoleum is clean, vast space.Upon leaving the grounds you have an opportunity to see his residence prior to exit for another fee.

It is fascinating to see how revered Ho Chi Minh was for the Vietnamese people- viewed as the father of the country doing marvelous things for his people.The mausoleum has a well preserved \"Uncle Ho\" lying in state, a little bit unusual, nevertheless interesting- reminiscent of the Mao mausoleum in Beijing. There is a lot of pomp and ceremony with white uniformed guards everywhere.The area is large and well cared for with many interesting sites within in besides the mausoleum itself. The yellow building, the Presidential Palace, Ho Chi Minh never lived there is worth a look. Seeing the homes where Ho lived are also interesting as is the display of his three cars."

My partner gallantly let me continue which consisted of marching for a further 45 mins in queues, along guarded roads and walkways until I entered a shining monolith of a building at which point the guards became even more intense. I seemed to get told of for having my hands in my pockets, holding a phone or arms crossed (if only they gave you induction into how to comport your limbs in said monolith. Eventual shadowy guard lined passageways gave way to opened up central tomb, a sunken area separated the masses from the glass sarcophagus encapsulating the dead man God and all his white wispy follicles.

The sighting of the body is quick, as you need to continue walking around the cube.Be sure to get the most out of the experience and read up on Ho Chi Mihn and his influence on the country before visiting the Mausoleum."

The guy wanted to be cremated, but there he is preserved for posterity with Russian technology, the way Lenin was. No pictures allowed inside. You file in and are quickly hustled around the bier and back out the door. You get less than 30 seconds to gaze at his body, so hopefully you didn't have to wait in line, although that can happen unless you are lucky enough to going during Tet when most of Hanoi leaves town."

It would have been simpler to just leave the camera at the first booth! Also, there are areas of footpath which you are not allowed to walk on. The actual mausoleum is a somber affair, where you silently file past the glass sarcophagus where Ho Chi Minh lies, and then back out to daylight. Uncle Ho is clearly revered by the Vietnamese people, and his imposing mausoleum is testament to that."

We visited this Hanoi \"attraction\" on a cold blustery day, followed the prescribed route and were part of a long line of mainly Vietnamese visiting Uncle Ho resting in his glass coffin in the dimly lit Mausoleum. Not something I would normally choose to spend even part of my morning doing. The building is not a pretty one and the experience haunting but unforgettable. Once out of the dimly lit Mausoleum the compound in which Ho Chi Minh spent his final days is of great interest. It is a calming place with beautiful French inspired building where he lived and worked. You need to understand that Ho was a man of culture, had travelled the world and only wanted to make his country great. Wether or not you agree with his philosophy he ultimately succeeded in doing this though he died before it became the place it is now.The history of Vietnam is tied up with this clever little man, though his countrymen failed to do as he asked and have him cremated ad his ashes buried in three caskets in the North, Middle and South of Vietnam. I think he would be less than happy with what they did to him for though he wanted his followers to visit the sites of his caskets he also asked that when they did so they planted a tree in his honour. A much greener way of remembering him rather than what we see today in his Mausoleum. Worth a visit if only to get an understanding of the man."

When I tried to visit this place I had my three year old daughter on my back in a child Carrier as she was tired. I asked at the front gate if it was OK to have her on my back while on the tour I was approached by a guard to say that you can not visit the masalium with your child on your back. I said I spoke with the staff at the entrance and they said it was ok to do so. As I went to keep up with the tour the same guard approached me from behind and tried to take my daughter out of the carrier she was in and in the process scratched her eye. By this time my daughter was historical and frightened. After I exchanged a few words that I will not repeat here I headed for the exit where I was escorted from the grounds. Not a very pleasant experience for us at all, considering we found the Vietnamese to be very friendly elsewhere."

There were guards ensuring that you take your camera to a booth where you will pickup your camera later. In addition, women cannot wear miniskirts or shorts inside.

There is also security to pass through - no water bottles and you need to sign in cameras as no photography is allowed. It is quite a walk from the entrance and you must walk on the lines. Guards are positioned to ensure the rules are enforced. On entering the building there is a sense of reverence. The light is dim and then you see the glass case protecting the body of this important leader to Vietnam. You process slowly around until you are exiting.

If you are in doubt about that, go to the museum afterwards, which tells you all about Ho Chi Minh and the struggles and development of modern Vietnam, its a great exhibition and well worth an hour or so spent over 3 levels of a very grand building for a modest entry fee."

You March up the stairs of the mausoleum and pass by 3 sides of Ho Chi Mihn, all at steady pace, as the color guards March you along. Somehow s you exit, they now have your cameras on the other side for you to use as you go look at the house and the garage with cars that Ho Chi Minh used.

I completely understand and respect the need for not allowing cameras and so on its just that the process was a bit weird and not as well organised as I anticipated. Perhaps if we had chosen to pay money to enter the other site it may have been easier for us to find our way back to our belongings. You will need a lot of patience and I'd only recommend doing it if you are really sure."

I know others have said it is boring, just a body in a room, but for me it really helped me to understand quite how much this man is revered here.We decided to get there early as we had heard about the lines and knew it would close in the middle of the day. We approached it from the direction of our hotel and could see the line to get in and walked towards it only to be waved off by a guard and had to walk all the way around the entire complex to find the actual entrance. I though we would never find it.You go through security with bag scanners and metal detectors and then have to check your bag instead of taking it with you. They said we had to pick up the bag by 10:30 and it was about 8:45 at the time. After that you start walking through a series of covered walkways. As you approach the mausoleum there are a number of guards in white uniforms, some holding rifles with bayonets. They instruct people to remove hats and as you enter the building, to be silent. There are signs everywhere saying no phones or cameras.We walked up some stairs after entering and then came into the chamber holding Ho Chi Minh's body. He is inside a glass case and the walkway is raised so that you walk around three sides of it. The room is darkened and the case is lit up. There are four guards standing at the corners of the case. He looks quite good. I understand from my reading that he is removed for a couple of months every year to be restored again.There is something quite amazing about feeling the reverence that the people have for this man. In other photos and documents we have seen him frequently called Uncle Ho.I don't think I fully \"got\" this experience until I had travelled the rest of the country and heard more about the war and Ho Chi Minh and heard from some of the Vietnamese people about how they feel. I was glad that I went as it provided context for the rest of our visit in Vietnam.Some have said not to take children. Our kids were 11 and 13. I just explained to them before we went in what they would see and they were totally fine."

I've been to Lenin's and Mao's mausoleums and they are all kind of \"must see\" for former or existing (depending on how you see it) socialist countries. So, I went and I didn't mind the queue. Do need to find the entrance as tourist guide books do not give your very precise information. But normally there is a crowd going there and just folow and you'll be there. Bags are not allowed and you need to keep it at the \"left luggage\". So far so good. No charge for everything. And that's vey nice.When you finish your \"tour\" (again, depends on how you see it), you will be led to a gate to enter Ho Chi Minh's museum and former residence. I finished tour near 11:30am and according to guidebook, this was about time to close for lunch break. So, I decided to skip the museum visit.Then, I found myself heading towards unknown direction. Theoretically, it shouldn't be a problem. I follow the boundary of the mausoleum and then must be able to get back to the \"left luggage\" counter. So, I walked. Then, I noticed that there's a park right next to the mausoleum. Because the museum and residence were inside the park, there was no short-cut to get back to where I started. It wsn't really a long walk (15 minutes, I think). But mind you, the \"left luggage\" service would be closed at 12 noon. So, all in a sudden, I found that I must run and need to be sure that I stayed on the right track. Otherwise, my bag would be left there and be kept there over the weekend (meaning I could not go back and pick up as I'll leave on the next day).No big deal. But if you don't need to bring a bag, don't bring it along.The other way to look at this is that mausoleum is free but you are expected to contribute by paying your entry fee to the museum. Not a big sum"

At one point we entered the mausoleum, a very cold and very silent room with dim lights and extra ordinary security where Mr. Ho Chi Minh's embalmed body was resting. Four sentry was guarding his body standing at the four corners of his bed. I thought how does it feel to stand like a statue and protect a body, and do this regularly for a living?

The depositing point for your valuables and cameras is different from the retrieval point, which is ferried by a staff.

Uncle Ho was loved and idolised by so many and it really shows when travelling throughout Vietnam. Regardless of political beliefs and backgrounds I can't help but respect the man for his accomplishments during his lifetime. The mausoleum building itself is no work of art however it does have a strong and powerful presence. There was a large line up to get in but I found it moved quite fast, I would get there early in the morning for quickest entry, also there is no admission fee."

Even if it is not really his body, which was hinted by our guide, again the experience is worth it. You buy a ticket and go through a series of checks, wait in line--single file--and enter the Mausoleum. As you walk past the body, you are admonished if you speak, if you show physical affection or anything but show great respect for he man/God. There are four guards surrounding the body standing rock still (except their eyes taking it all in). I wonder how often they change these guards and how many faint? This is a great way to experience Communism."

Of course it is a great place to visit to witness the respect and admiration the Vietnamese hold for 'Uncle Ho', it is not a beautiful nor awe-inspiring piece of architecture.Of typical Soviet-esque construction, set in the middle of a large plaza, across from the Vietnamese parliament it is an obvious landmark in Hanoi.The most interesting part of the experience would be watching the changing of the guard."

The first stop was an ATM so we could get some Vietnamese currency.Our first site was a visit to the Ho Chi MInh mausoleum. \u00a0You are not allowed to take any photos inside so unfortunately, we had to leave our cameras with Alex while he waited for us to see the actual tomb. \u00a0Ho Chi Minh is embalmed, laying in this huge building that resembles Lenin's tomb in Moscow. \u00a0He is in a coffin-like case and his hands and face appear to be glowing as if they are lit from within. \u00a0 Four guards stood at attention at all \u00a0times within the tomb without moving a muscle. Right in front of the mausoleum is this HUGE boulevard that is closed to all cars. \u00a0And, surrounding the building are these really beautiful gardens. \u00a0In addition to the gardens, we could see the presidential palace that was built by the French a couple of hundred years ago. \u00a0Ho Chi Minh never lived in it because he felt it would be \"unseemly\" given the abject poverty of the vast majority of the Vietnamese so he lived in a much smaller residence with three fairly basic rooms albeit they did have his four cars on display - one of them being a Rolls-Royce!Later on, Ho Chi Minh moved to another home based on the Thai model of building homes on stilts. \u00a0This particular home was quite beautiful, made almost entirely of teakwood. \u00a0Adjacent to the home was his bomb shelter which was used quite often during the \"American\" war as it is called here. \u00a0As the communist leader got older, he was no longer able to comfortably climb the steps to the stilt house so he moved to another residence 200 yards from the stilt home - also a small home with three rooms and an adjoining apartment with all his medical equipment to keep him going!"

If you come to Hanoi you must visit the Mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh - Ho Chi Minh is considered by many Vietnamese to be the founder of modern day Vietnam. Best time to come is in the Winter when crowds are at their lowest as otherwise waiting time can be over two hours. No photos or electric equipment are allowed in the building so be aware of this before you intend to lug expensive equipment around with you (if you do decide to do so, then be aware that it will be taken off you and returned later after the tour). The exhibit claims to be the preserved remains of Ho Chi Minh (I'll let you be the judge) - there is a deep sense of respect and reverence throughout. You must be silent when you enter and keep your hands out of your pockets. Photos are forbidden.Worth the wait? Probably not. A must see when in Hanoi? Absolutely. What pushed this from a 2 to a 3 was the rest of the attraction where you can see where Ho Chi Min lived - giving you a sense of the simplicity of the man, how he never wanted to forget he was a man of the people. You see the bunker he lived near during the many wars and the old Presidential home. I will definitely be picking up a good book when I get home to find out more about him."

You can't stop and you are invited by soldiers in white uniform to continue walking around it. Inside the Mausoleum are (which is very big), there are other spots to visit. Interesting the history of Ho Chi Minh: you need at least another extra hour if you want to read all in the Museum. Getting out of the Mausoleum area, you will bump into the One Pillar Pagoda so you can combine the two visits. There are lots of limitation to visit the Mausoleum: check the opening hours, check that the remains are not under restoration (periodically they are and a team of Soviet doctors come to Hanoi to do the work), make sure your legs and shoulders are covered, you have to leave your camera and you will pick it up when you exit. I strongly recommend this visit if you want to better understand Ho Chi Minh personality and role in the Vietnam history. Cuing is not a big issue as you will socialize with many lovely locals."

However I just went in Nov 2015 and there is a whole new security set-up around the area that directs all the traffic through a screening process to get into the area to see the mausoleum and the one pillar pagoda. I was very confused about what was happening but we went along with the line to see what was happening. You had to turn over your computers and cameras. I was also told that I had to cover my knees. We were marched 2 by 2 to the mausoleum and went inside to see Ho Chi lying in state! The atmosphere was very stately and we were really surprised to be a part of it. It's unclear to me if that is always an option or if we got there on a special day?"

It seems that the late revered leader of Vietnam was not much into pomp and pageantry but after his death his followers were not content to let him slip into oblivion. Thus this massive memorial park with his embalmed body lying in permanent state with an honour guard in his large mausoleum,the official Presidential palace,his last simple wooden house,his office and even his garage with his cars! There is a well looked after garden and a pretty lake. There is also a large parade ground for national level celebrations. Good for history buffs though the queue for the tomb can get very long."

The mausoleum is the highlight of the Ha Noi city tour because this is where visitors can see the preserved remains of the late Vietnamese President HCM. Big bags and cameras are to be left near the entrance for security reasons and security is also tight inside the mausoleum, which is understandable. There are many nice views right outside the mausoleum such as government buildings and visitors can take pictures after getting back their cameras from the check-in counter.

This is the first attraction in Hanoi we have visited where locals outnumbered tourists. Judging by the numbers of school parties, this visit is part of the curriculum! The closer we approached the mausoleum, the more officious became the behaviour of the guards. One of us had our hands in our pockets, to be told by a guard (who looked all of 18 years) to 'put your hands down'! Interesting sights while waiting in the queue included white-uniformed guards goose stepping, a school band striking up followed by the rest of the school party emulating the guards in goose stepping. Until then, we hadn't felt the communist regime in Hanoi. After an hour of queuing, we were treated to a 5-second glimpse of the great leader as the queue snaked round his well-preserved body. You decide if it's worth it."

He's guarded heavily by guards in white, neatly pressed uniforms. They don't tolerate much in ole Ho's presence---not even crossing your arms. As for Ho, he glows as if he just came out of a radioactive spray tan booth. The Vietnam and communinst flags proudly hang behind him.

Do not misunderstand; these guards were serious and took their duty seriously. But. It was no more than you would see at major political locations elsewhere in the world, and far less anxiety-ridden than our last trip to Beijing.Perhaps my favorite part was enjoying the many groups of school children visiting Ho Chi Minh's residence area with their teachers. As a teacher, it is reassuring to see that we all look the same when we take children on field trips. More importantly, there is a unifying effect of smiles, waves, and \"Hello!\" repeated again, again, and again. The world could use a team of 5-year-old ambassadors.The museum is top-notch, and while it was difficult at times--given the history between the USA and Vietnam--the artistic nature of many of the areas was quite enjoyable."

Our line of locals and tourists then walked almost in single file march, on the road rather than the pavement, up to the mausoleum, the red carpeted entrance up to the concrete block holding it flanked by white uniformed guards, who grimly suggest you remove your sunglasses and whatnot. Once inside and into the sudden darkened blast of Aircon, still in single file or two abreast and in complete silence, we proceeded round short right angles of concrete stairs, a guard on every corner, until reaching the kernel of the building and shuffling round the u-shaped mezzanine where Ho lay in his sarcophagus highlighted under dimmed lights, flanked by four guards again - three very serious and one looking like he was about to corpse (no pun intended). Ho's tidy beard was in order and I suppose he was as immaculate as any preserved head of state might be. Apparently he's sent off to Russia for two months each year to have an oil change of his Soviet strength formaldehyde. It was a bit of a relief to exit and return to normal. We loitered outside to get our camera back (you hand them in, bagged up) as the guards trickled out of the building after the tourists. They formed up with their bayoneted rifles and marched off. I swear each one was wearing bright white hunter wellies. You then continue around the complex - in our case, shortly before it closed for lunchtime, the regimented feeling not abated by the slow pursuit of a uniformed type tapping his watch as we peered into the austere rooms Ho inhabited by his fountained fish pond, stilt house and small collection of old cars."

At the entrance you have to leave your bag, backpack, day packs etc. Take out your valuables like cameras & money then you queue up. They will give you a small hand bag with a camera logo outside. You can put your other valuables in here. They give you a ticket # for the bag. Further in, there is another counter where you have to leave this bag because cameras & cellphones are not allowed.Once you're queued up in two lines the leader will take you while other guards direct you which way to go. Before entering remove your sunglass because you will get told off to remove it. If you make a notice inside you will get told off. As you walk in the tomb there is no pausing or stopping so you look as you go. Once you've finished this go through the presidential palace then finish picking up your valuables & bags. As this point you can access the front part of the tomb from walking outside the street. Turn left on this particular street, you won't miss it because it's a wide street & is barricaded from vehicles... walk the length of this street.If you finished early then you can see other groups go through it & you can now take photos from the other side of this street. You'll encounter guards matching of as well."

The day we went it was very hot, some of the walkways at the start of the exhibit are covered but once you leave this area it is out in the hot sun.

Just before 9pm guards march out to ceremonious music to take the flag down. It is all taken very seriously and it is a very grand gesture to occur every night. I believe a similar ceremony takes place every morning to raise the flag too.If you are staying nearby in Hanoi city, it is definitely worth going one evening or maybe in the morning to see how much respect is paid by the locals for this daily event."

I have read some of the other reviews and clearly some didn't do their homework -- yes, the mausoleum closes for some months for renovations -- understandable, but don't forget the 70 year anniversary was in September 2015 as well. As far as an ugly building - clearly these people are not in the building industry -- to consider it was built in the 60's i think it is a testament of Vietnam's growth -- well done. This was the first place our guide took us and yes, you can't take a backpack or anything in fact inside -- most of all just obey the instructions from the guards and all will be good. I would recommend if you are going to visit, do some reading of history and ask about opening times. What appears to me, that everyone tries to go early as you walk a far bit under a covered walkway and you wait, and wait; but the afternoon seemed not so busy. You can't take cameras and remove your hat as a mark of respect."

The queue was horrendous when we first arrived, many of groups of school children so our tour guide decided to take us to the Temple of Literature first and come back later in the morning when the queues had died down.When we returned later in the morning the queue was a lot better and took around 15 mins to reach the entrance of Mausoleum. Camera's and water were placed into lockers whilst you visit the mausoleum, no pictures or water allowed inside the building.Upon entering the middle section of the building you enter a cool air conditioned room where the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh lays inside a glass case - very strange to look at. When filing pass the body you must be appropriately dressed shoulders covered, no short shirts or shorts quiet, no smiling, no folding your arms or hands in pockets or you'll be told off by the soldiers that guard his body. The viewing of his body takes all of 5 secs to walk around the glass case and then back out to the grounds. I found visiting his modest house on stilts and car collection much more interesting than viewing an embalmed body. Ho Chi Minh lived a modest life which I found surprising. The grounds with a gorgeous pond in the middle are immaculate and enjoyable to walk around. Close by is the One Pillar Pagoda which sits in the middle of a small pond. Throughout the grounds you will see soldiers in their immaculate white uniforms marching around the place. Changing of the guards which was interesting and amusing to watch.It's a busy place with many visitors but an interesting place to visit. You really do a get a feel of how loved and well respected Ho Chi Minh was by the Vietnamese people."

The good thing is that they have the waiting areas covered, so in the rain you can stay semi-dry, but I would bring an umbrella, too. View the grounds, his house and garden areas. This place was built for him, although Ho Chi Minh lived modestly (compared to?). Again, having a tour guide to inform you about the buildings and grounds is helpful.

The Vietnamese in the line were solemn and respectful as you would expect judging by the reverence they still have for Ho despite it being almost 50 years since his death.

Beautifully maintained gardens surround the complex, so there is always something to look at despite the crowds."

This is the final resting place of Ho Chi Minh, the most iconic and popular leader of Vietnam, known to his people as \u2018Uncle Ho\u2019. His body is preserved here in a glass case at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in central Hanoi (although he had requested to be cremated). His body lies in state similar to Lenin, Stalin and Mao, other great communist leaders before him.Security is tight and visitors should dress with respect (no shorts, sleeveless shirts and miniskirts) and everyone has to deposit their bags and cameras before getting in. Visitors are not allowed to stop and hold the constant queue up as the place is constantly busy.Highly recommend to go early in the morning, as the queue is long, and it gets quite hot standing in line. You will not only see streams of school kids lining up (learning their own history and great leader) but Vietnamese travel from far to see and pay their respect to Ho Chi Minh so dont be suprised the amount of people there are when you arrive. The queue does move fast. You will be ushered in by guards in 2 straight lines into the Mausoluem which is very cool and air conditioned. You will be only allowed to see him from the moving line and talking is prohibited. Though it only takes a few seconds to walk into and around to see this embalmed corpse, you feel immediately silent and transfixed when viewing the body. It is an eering and scary feeling but nonetheless well worth the visit. Every year the embalmed corpse is sent to Russia for maintenance so the mausoleum closes for a couple of months from October. Check with your hotel before planning your trip.HCM's Mausoleum is connected to HCM's Presidential Palace and historical site. After you exist the Mausoleum, you walk through a small garden and pay to enter to visit the Palace.Opening Hours: Tuesday to Thursday and weekends from 8am \u2013 11am.

We arrived at about 10:20am and were pleased that we didn't have to do much queuing, even though it was a Saturday. Watching pop songs about 'Uncle Ho' was a bit bizarre before then being ushered through to see the man himself. We enjoyed wandering round the gardens and seeing the One Pillar Pagoda which is just nearby. A strange experience but we'll worth a visit!"

We got in line about 8:30 am, after checking our backpack and camera at two separate locations. We were then funneled into a very well organized group in two lines to wait for out turn to visit the mausoleum. The entire queue is covered with hardened roofing or fabric covering so you're not in direct sunlight. We waited about 30 minutes. Upon entering the mausoleum, the AC is a welcome blast. There are guards everywhere an you file up the stairs, into the chamber and around the crystal casket, then down the stairs on the other side and out you go. It was really fascinating to be there with mostly Vietnamese people paying their respects. The mausoleum itself is free, but after leaving there the only possible exit is through the grounds of the estate, for which there is a fee. It took us another 25 minutes to figure out how and where to get our backpack and camera back, and wade through the hordes of people exploring the grounds. All in all, a very interesting experience. Definitely worth a visit."

The process of getting from the street into the grounds and through the mausoleum itself is very strictly controlled and super efficient. Enter at the corner of Hung Vuong and Le Hong Phong Sts. The mausoleum is the last resting place of Ho Chi Minh and a symbol of gratitude and respect from Viet Namese people for president Ho Chi Minh. Rules regarding dress and behavior are strictly enforced by staff and guards. Legs must be covered (no shorts or miniskirts). Visitors must be silent, and walk in two lines. It's a solemn place, and must be entered in silence. Hands must not be in pockets, nor arms crossed. Smoking, drinking, eating, photography and filming are also not permitted anywhere inside the mausoleum. 8-11am Tue-Thu, Sat & Sun Dec-Sep, last entry 10.15am. Behind the mausoleum are the Presidential Palace, a carp pond, the stilt house where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked during the last decade of his life. It is based on homes of the Montagnard ethnic group of the far north. The mausoleum and museum are examples of soviet era architecture. Ho Chi Minh (light bearer) once said \u201cTo reap a return in ten years, plant a tree; but to reap a return in 100 years, cultivate a people. A wise man who is respected by Vietnamese and foreigners alike. Uncle Ho is consider one the most influential people of last century by Time magazine. Opposite the mausoleum a new national assembly building is being constructed. Check out the neighboring gardens before visiting the 1,000-somethng-year-old Pagoda. While the pagoda itself is small, the complex is definitely worthwhile."

We waited for a long time before we were ushered in, and we were expected to place our bags at a station near the entrance. The staff at this station were rude and brusque towards me -- while I understand that it was a hot Saturday and she had to combat the crowd, there was no need to glare at me after giving me the luggage tag, or act like repeating oneself is a chore when I asked her to. This trip was simply an incessant wait to see one of the most overrated attractions. After queueing for an incredibly long time, at times under the hot sun, we entered the mausoleum to see the body of Ho Chi Minh. It was a complete waste of time and we wanted unnecessarily long just to see his body, and I was incredibly uncomfortable with this extravagant display. I understand why the Vietnamese people venerate Ho Chi Minh, but such an ostentatious display of his preserved body served to undermine his wishes and values, and this makes everything feel exploitative. Getting my bag after this encounter was a hassle because I had to walk all the way back to the entrance to get my bag in the heat, and two security guards gave me contradictory directions so I didn't know if I should continue on the demarcated path or retrace my steps back to the entrance. At the end, there was also a pathway for locals and foreigners, and I wondered why this was so, and that everyone's movement had to be so restructed. I also got yelled at a few times, and the language barrier served to exacerbate the situation. In fact, I was in such a bad mood that I did not want to see the other attractions in the area, like Ho Chi Minh's Presidential house. It was infuriating to get questioned everywhere I went -- I understood why, but this bordered on paranoia and greatly hampered me as I made my way to get my bag. The upside was that some guards were helpful and pointed the way, but most of the time, I felt like I was being questioned for no reason. I also thought I got lost in this large compound, and worried that I wouldn't get my bag back. I was also falsely led to another baggage station that didn't have my bag, and it was frustrating to finally obtain it. The long queues, walking time and getting fried under the hot sun was not worth it just to see the President's dead body. Do not bother with this attraction at all, visit the museums, cafes, or whatever else tickles your fancy."

A unique experience. Well worth the visit. Queues move quickly."

Nothing really made sense to me with lots of abstract art which appeared to have a very loose link to Ho Chi Minh, all very surreal! The layout appeared to be very haphazard with no real flow. There was also very few English translations so overall a disappointing experience and one place to be avoided if you don't have much time in Hanoi. The sign posting outside is very poor which meant we were unable to find Uncle Ho's Stilt House"

When I went back to queue, the guard pointed at my shorts and said 'No-no' again. \u00a3$%^&*( Then we had to go shopping for trousers, but again, the cheapest option was 6$ and I didnt really need trousers,so finally we decided to take a taxi back to our hotel and get the clothes. It was cheaper, indeed. When we finally were in the loooong queue, it was already around 11 o'clock. Luckily the queue moved quickly. We went inside the complex and had to leave everything at the entrance: bags, camara, even water bottle. The queue moved forward very quickly and in around 10 min we were inside. I was funny, as so much rush to get to the mauseleum and you spend inside around 10-15 seconds. The queue just keeps moving, you are not allowed to stop inside, you enter, go around the glass box with Ho Chi Minh body without stopping and then just go outside. So much morning rush for 10 seconds of experience. Anyway, it was interesting. Just make sure to wear the appropriate clothes:))"

It's hard to appreciate the degree of veneration for HCM in Vietnam until you visit the HCM Mausoleum complex--you'll find locals coming in their Sunday best and often waiting in line for hours just for a 30-second moment with what may or may not be Ho Chi Min's embalmed remains. I'd strongly suggest coming early in the morning on a weekday, especially if you're coming in the summer--doing so beats both the weekend lines and the afternoon heat. It's an absolute must to wear conservative clothing--for men, this means full pants, and for women, this means covered shoulders / skirts or pants covering the knees. A few people not keeping to the dress code were asked to leave while in line. Don't expect to stay in the actual tomb for very long--the line moves very efficiently."

The building is protected by guards in white uniforms, and a large yellow line indicates the limit to how close you can get to them. I was quite lucky to time my visit with the 'changing of the guard'. It's an impressive display of synchronised slow marching. I was out-numbered of course - most of the visitors were Vietnamese coming to pay their respects to their past President. If you decide to go inside the mausoleum, be careful with what you wear (e.g. no short skirts or tank tops) and expect a security check. You mustn't talk, point, or take photos. Be respectful!"

So when you exit the mausoleum you end up at the entrance to the palace/museum/buildings which we had not planned to do but the alternative was to walk back around in the hot sun so we chose to pay and walk through the gardens, it was quite interesting to see the displays and it was certainly nice in the shade. Wandering around, seeing Ho Chi Minh has prompted me to read a bit more about him and his beliefs so I think that is always good when such a visit motivates this to happen.

One evening, she handed my my iPad with it queued to a one hour documentary on him. I was flummoxed that we Americans were not taught more about him beyond newscasts about the Ho Chi Minh Trail. That such a beautiful monument exists to celebrate Ho Chi Minh's life is not surprising. Everywhere i visited in Vietnam--from north to south-- the young and the old alike asked me about him with love and affection. There was never any doubt in my mind that he remains significant to the population. The mausoleum is set in a very large urban park-like setting. During day and night, people are present; many exercising in the park, many just being comtemplative and others just being pedestrians passing by. Viewing hours are limited each day and the setting is somber. No photographs permitted. Guards are present and I was present for the changing of the guards one evening which was special. For an outdoor ( and much cooler) experience, i would suggest a nighttime visit. The monument is salient and well lit which I thought enhanced the experience. A trip to Hanoi should include this venue on your itinerary. And take the oportunity to learn about this leader and his simple objective, albeit one that complicated to achieve, i.e. freedom for the Vietnamese people from the colonialist powers."

You will leave your bags at the entry point for free to be collected upon return.No cameras allowed either. Cameras will be collected short way towards the Mausoleum and will be returned on the way out.Conservative clothing essential. Short shorts, skirts, open to and sleeveless t-shirts and garments are a no no.

It's ironic that Ho Chi Minh, who engineered Vietnamese independence and eventual reunification, stated that he wanted a simple burial when he died.Instead he has been embalmed, put into a glass casket, and is on daily public display in the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, a monumental edifice in Hanoi.When I say on daily display, that is not quite true. On an earlier visit to the Mausoleum it was shut because Ho Chi Minh's embalmed corpse had been sent back to Moscow for a \"touch up\".It seems strange to want to go and see a dead body, but this was a giant of 20th Century who took on the might of the French and then the United States and won, although he died before eventual victory.You must be on your best behavior when you go to see him. Dress conservatively and remove your sun glasses. Wait in line, which can sometimes be quite long, and don't laugh or chatter loudly, or you will be castigated by one of the guards. In fact it is best to keep a very serious and demure look on your face at all times,At the entrance there are bouquets of flowers for sale for you to place on the Ho Chi Minh shrine. I suspect that as soon as you have left they are recycled for resale to the next visitors. But it is curious to see many Vietnamese buying the bouquets and soundly banging their heads on the concrete floor several times as they place the flowers, copious tears flowing in the meantime.Once inside you must keep moving, so you basically take a slow walk past old Uncle Ho, resplendent in his simple khaki uniform and waxed make up, and marvel at the deification of this humble man.By the way, no cameras allowed inside."

The mausoleum is fantastic, gave me goose bumps and eerier feelings to see how they can preserved president HCM body perfectly! The President seems like resting/sleeping peacefully.What i want to comment here is during my visit to the presidential (old house) where when i just walked in and strolling over the house area, trying to read and learn about HCM history, furniture, etc. suddenly me and my family were chased away/OUT from that area just because it's their lunch time, what?? Seriously, lunch time at 11:00 a.m??And how can a tourist spot can be closed for lunch time?? What???We paid 20K VD just to enter the HCM old house, yes it's very little money but it's NOT free!! But the mausoleum is free.At the end of my trip, especially at the HCM Square I can say I learned NOTHING!It seems that this place is 'NOT READY' to 'share' their history stories to the tourist yet. I was very disappointed during my whole visit. I was waiting to come to this place months and months before, and what I expect from this place maybe little higher than what they can give, probably. But, lunch time at tourist stop? hmm..Hopefully they will improved.My advice, just come very early, meaning 08:00 AM you have to be there at the Square already."

Locals (from all over Vietnam) would come here just to pay their respects to Mr. HCM. Some who live in Hanoi even come here multiple times a week!You can tell that the locals really respect and admire Mr. HCM, and it is sheer devotion and gratitude that many come as early as 7am (the place opens at 8am and the queue forms way beforehand). I visited at a time when it was summer vacation for the schools, so there were many children on excursions as well and the queue longer than usual.It is a solemn place and you do have to watch your behaviour, as well as attire. No flip-flops nor shorts (even bermudas) are allowed, so try to come in long pants and be clad in smart casual. I just found the experience quite a breathtaking one, and out of the ordinary. Definitely worth a visit if you have time in your itinerary - set aside a full morning if you'd like to explore the compound of the Ba Dinh Square as well."

When we arrived the huge queue just to enter the front gate was extremely off putting, the line was about 300 metres long. We'd read that it does move quickly so we joined the line. Officials were very efficient in keeping the line moving. You go through a security checkpoint, bags are x-rayed and you go through a metal detector. All cameras and bulky bags have to be checked in. Both men and women have to have knees and shoulders covered - no shorts or singlets - they monitor dress code strictly and some visitors were given smocks to wear to cover up. Once through security it was another long queue, stretching at least 500 metres. It took us a good half an hour but it was under the cover of awnings so we had some protection from the sun.As we were about to enter the mausoleum, the protection guards stopped everyone entering and we watched a group of Vietnamese war veterans lay a wreath and march into the mausoleum. It was great to observe this tribute to the past and see the respect locals have for this monument.Once inside the mausoleum you have to keep moving and aren\u2019t allowed to talk. Protection guards continually move you. In the centre of the mausoleum lies the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh himself, laid out behind glass. It was a bit eerie seeing his body laid out like that. We were also fortunate during our very brief visit to see the changing of the protection guards that surround his body. For all of the queuing we were only inside the mausoleum for mere minutes but it was something a bit historic and different to see.Within the complex you can also visit former residences of Ho Chi Minh, including the old Presidential Palace, and there are well planned and laid out gardens and a lake. The visit to the mausoleum itself is free; you only have to pay if you want to see outside the Presidential Palace.Glad we took the time to include a visit to this site."

An honor guard surrounding him on the second level in a glass coffin lined with ornate wood. Must go here."

However upon entering the cool calm of the mausoleum we were instantly transformed. We filed slowly into a dimly lit room where a large wooden ornate glass sided casket housed Ho Chi Minh himself. Four guards dress impeccably in their rather splendid white uniforms stand silently at each corner of the casket. I have to admit our ignorance at this point as neither myself or my husband knew much of Ho Chi Minh or an awful lot of his work, however we left the room where he lay in state totally in ore and touched by this somewhat surreal experience. From the mausoleum you proceed to explore the grounds and the house where he spent his final years. The lake and gardens are nice to walk round although not particularly vast.

We were in line for about 3/4 of an hour. Viewing Ho's body is a matter of about 2 minutes, the immaculately white-uniformed honour guard keeping the line smoothly moving. It is clearly of huge significance to the Viet people despite Ho himself, a man who led a simple life, not having wanted any such cult around him, stating in his will that he wished to be cremated.The park surrounding the Mausoleum has an entrance fee to visit Ho Chi Minh's houses, the Pagoda etc, but is well worth it.If you just want to look at the Mausoleum building itself, this is possible from outside the park."

It was a very interesting experience (no cameras allowed of course), but what an opportunity to see him lying in state with presidential guards all around. You're then ushered out the doors, and into the presidential palace grounds where you have to pay to enter - free to visit the Mausoleum, and 25,000 dong to visit the grounds (which is the only way we found to get out!). Worth a stroll though the grounds, and a very quick visit for us, we were out at the main entrance again by 11.30am (that is the final time to collect your bags from the drop off zone). Give it two thumbs up! Woman, remember to wear long pants or skirt below the knees, and a top that covers your shoulders, and men also a t-shirt and longer shorts or pants, and recommend going earlier in the morning so you don't have to stress about getting back to the entrance by 11.30am (when they close off bag pickup) to collect your personal items!

Also, completely avoid the time from 29th of April until 1st of May. They're national holidays in Vietnam (30th of April is Liberation day) and there will be lines around the block.

Everything is very well sign posted.If staying in the Old Quarter I would recommend getting a taxi only 50000VND as its quite a walk in the heat - we took taxi there and walked back.It was good to see Uncle Ho and to see the locals paying their respects to him - was an experience.Well worth visiting!"

You must wait in line, check any thing you are carrying, and no cameras.It is a stark place and there is a enclosed area where the preserved body of \"Uncle Ho\" as he is referred to by the Vietnamese is encased in glass. It's eerie looking at the body of a small man who was responsible for a civil war and brought a Communist government to all of Vietnam. The masoleum is only open for a few months each year as the body is removed to keep it preserved. Check to see when it's open as well as the hours of viewing which are only 4 hours per day.Worth the visit."

The Vietnamese government has a program where they pay for their war veterans to travel to Hanoi to visit the mausoleum. Many of them come from countryside villages and see significantly less (or no) westerners where they live. When I visited with my sister a group of veterans wanted to talk with us. They were so adorable. Our friend, who is local Vietnamese, told them one of us was American and one was Canadian. When we asked her later why she did that she said, \"They'll be so excited to go home to their villages and tell everyone they talked with people from two different countries.\" I supposed it's a unique experience to see Uncle Ho's embalmed body but, like I said, it's a long time in line for a very brief view of him."

It did only take us 35 minutes to get to the mausoleum itself. If you are a westerner you will find yourself in a huge minority, and will be the object of a certain amount of very good-natured attention from the locals. There are locals of all ages in the queue, from babes in arms to pensioners. Dress and attitude are expected to be respectful, and the closer you get to the mausoleum itself, the more the guards are vigilant about behaviour, even of children. There are often large groups of schoolchildren from Kindy upwards who have a special ceremony to lay a wreath at the entrance to the tomb, which cause a certain amount of delay in proceedings for those ordinary members of the public in the queue. You are ushered silently and swiftly through the central chamber where Uncle Ho's remains are displayed, guarded by four immaculate white-clad guardsmen. We did see a couple of people in wheelchairs who got their own white-clad guard to carry them up and down the stairs."

That is my \"BUT\" of the review. Would have been more interesting to take in the place if you could stop up and look around. After the mausoleum, you can walk the Ho Chi Minh grounds and it's very interesting. There is a souvenir shop and food to buy as well.

A slightly surreal experience as our group lined up to visit his body lying in state in an unmistakeably Russian influenced mausoleum. No smiling, hands out of pockets and certainly no pictures is a no brainer but the soldiers guarding the body make sure all visitors are suitably solemn so bear it in mind and don't try any clandestine photos. The guards are all volunteers and it's apparently a job for life according to our guide. Once you've shuffled through and seen the body you can tour the site to see some of Ho Chi Minh's other places of residence from the rather grand French colonial buildings down to the more modes wood house he lived in during some of his final years.The site is always busy with many Vietnamese coming to visit their former leader. Whilst he is preserved here for as long as time allows, it's interesting to note that his final wish was to be cremated and his ashes scattered throughout his beloved land. When you arrive you will need to be aware that backpacks need to be surrendered at a drop off point and you can pick them up at the end so make sure you take your wallet with you. Also, before entering the mausoleum you will have to hand over your camera which by now will be in a red bag handed to you on entrance. All our items were returned safe and sound so there were no problems but something to be aware of."

Once inside, you have to shuffle along with a lot of other tourists and locals to see Ho Chi Minh in repose. I doubt that it is the actual body of Ho Chi Minh, (it does look a bit waxy).

Hundreds of school children, all of whom were keen to smile and wave and call out \"hello\" to us, were visiting the \"father\" of their nation. As were hundreds of Vietnamese people. They were all very obviously moved by seeing their leader.The queue time isn't boring because you get to see military officers marching around in their gum boots, and are often shoved into single file, or pulled apart into pairs (depending on the whim of the officer, or so it seemed) and trying not to giggle at everyone who is taking the queuing oh so seriously!It's free to go in, so worth a visit"

Once you are in the actual mausoleum, there is no stopping, the line just keeps moving but you are able to view the area well. The guards are everywhere. Interesting part of history and felt it was a good place to visit to get an idea of the history. Would recommend going as soon as it opens as crowds are less. No bags or cameras are allowed inside. They have to be turned in have if you have them. Have to dress respectfully, covered shoulders, no shorts.No talking and hands out of pockets and a respectful attitude is very important, otherwise the guards can single you out.This may sound intimidating but it really is not bad and a good place to visit. Just somethings to be aware of. Good idea to check the timings before going.Inside the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, Ho's body lies in state under a glass sarcophagus, overseen by an honor guard of four sentries standing at each corner of the bier. The embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh is very well preserved. His face and hands are illuminated.The rest of the room is dimly lit. The grounds have the presidential palace building but it is not open to tourists. One can see it from outside and straying from the designated path is not a good idea. The grounds have the wooden stilt house that Ho Chi Minh used to live in as he did not live in the palace and the house is open to the public and one can walk up the place and look at the house as the rooms are open. It is not very big and has only 2 rooms with few of his belongings. The grounds have fruit trees and a pond in the center."

I obviously lingered for a fraction of a second too long and was grabbed and dragged twice. The whole process from beginning to end is regulatory and disciplinary and I get the distinct impression that any slight transgression such as sneezing or coughing could get you into hot water with the officials throughout this venue. Not for anyone who has any mobility issues or behavioural challenges as these will not be tolerated. Good respectful behaviour required throughout. The complex outside and Ho Chi Minhs house are fascinating and worth a visit."

It's a good day and well worth the visit. It's does not open on Mondays and it closes for a few hours of each day. I think 11.00 until 2.00pm. Di best work around these times. You should enjoy it.

The whole area look so beautiful. Before entering the secured area you have to hand over the travel accessories like Jacket, camera etc to the staff of security. If you are along with the travel guide he would carry all the belongings. While entering the area the people are standing in the que very politely and patiently. Ho Chi Minh is very well respected personality in Vietnam like Mahatma Gandhi in India. His body is kept in a glass box and the body is lying as if he is sleeping. People are looking at him with so much reverence. When you are coming out you are onto a well maintained garden. A very good experience."

The lake inside is nice and it was interesting to see Ho Chi Minh's house, cars and the house on stilts.We returned the following day to enter and see Ho Chi Minh. The line was huge but moved very quickly - be mindful of people who push in initially though. Once through the first security check point you have to leave your back pack at a luggage check point and are given a tag for collection. About 150m further along you are required to hand over your camera and are also given another tag. From there you queue up again and walk along until you get to the main building. There are guards everywhere, some with firearms and bayonets attached. As you approach the building you must walk in two single files. You are required to walk around to the left inside the building, up the stairs in an anti clockwise direction towards the body. You then enter a cold, quiet room where there are 4 guards standing with guns/bayonets at either corner of a clear glass coffin. You are not permitted to stop walking and will be ushered along if you do. You are probably in the room for about 1 minute all up but I definitely think it's something to be seen whilst in Hanoi.After you leave the building you return to a different point close by to collect your camera and the same place as where you drop your bag off.Entry to the Mausoleum is free and there is a 25 000 VND fee if you wish to see the rest of the complex."

Two in our group got herded into a lineup that was going to the mausoleum and we didnt know it. The other 4 missed out as it closed by 11am. When you go to the museum complex do this first. It is everything you would expect from our tv experiences into mausoleum protocol. Marching single file into a cool, dark building, parading around the glass encased and guarded body.

It's a worthwhile experience for those of us that remember the Vietnam War; for younger people it probably won't mean much. Interesting to see the revered \"Uncle Ho\" (preserved and sent to Russia every year for \"maintenance\"). A historic icon in Vietnam, but sad to have read in various writings that he just wanted to be cremated and his ashes scattered over Vietnam. The gardens, pond, his house, and seeing the cars he drove were restful after (briefly) filing past his remains. Not for everyone. You really have to go with a feeling for the history of the era and some knowledge of the conflicts within Vietnam."

It would have been quite confusing if we were on our own as it was not obvious where to go or what the protocol was. We saw many war veterans paying their resects and then we were ushered in to the mausoleum. You have to keep moving past the body and the walk though only took a few minutes but it was quite interesting. We then saw more of the grounds and the house Ho chi min lived in which was also quite interesting. None of this attraction was mind blowing but if you have a good guide who can tell you the back ground and some good stories then it is definitely worth a look."

Many people who came late would have missed ou when it closed. Within this area is also the Presidential Palace, Ho Ch Minh's House, the Botannical Gardens and the One Pillar Pagoda. All up I spent some 5 or 6 hours touring these complexes and it was a day very well spent.

The temple was closed for refurbishments and by the time I ambled past the souvenir sellers to the museum, I couldn't bare more tourists (plus the place looked huge).

First you have to pass a security screen, and leave any bags and cameras at desk, as not pictures are allowed( which you will get back exiting the mausoleum). Also don't both bring water in as it won't pass security and you will either have to drink it all or dump it. You have to walk single file with plenty of military guards onsite, and walking to the mausoleum feel surreal. There is an open parade ground next to the mausoleum making it look like a communist army is going to march through, saluting Ho Chi Minh. It's important that you keep quiet while entering and view Ho Chi Minh body as it is seen as disrespectful. After seeing his body, you go pass the presidential palace, and see the stilt house, similar to where Ho Chi Minh stayed before coming to power. Shorty after there is a pagoda which is still being built, overall worth a visit and your time."

Be aware that talking and laughing while inside would be very disrespectful.

The whole process was kind of fascinating. Once you are out of the mausoleum, you can pick up your camera if they asked you to leave it and you are free to roam through the rest of the complex and take as many pictures as you like.

It would be hard to imagine promoting such reverence and respect with tourists wandering all over the shop acting as if in the street. I didn't have a problem with it. There was no cost, as it should be. The walk through the chamber where Ho's body is held takes only seconds but the observer gets a clear idea. No talking, no camera etc and all under the careful scrutiny of white uniformed guards giving clear direction as to what is expected. For gardeners, the huge bonsai pots surrounding the mausoleum are a treat. It was great to see so many school groups in their white hats visiting. The mausoleum complex is open from 08.00-11.00 and 14.00-16.00 and is closed on Mondays and Friday afternoons. If you're of an age from the war, this is a must."

Remember you are visiting a tomb so the security police will be on look out for any misbehaviour, disrespect or attempts to take photos. When you reach his tomb you just pass by . no stopping, no hands in pockets etc , dont draw attention to yourself they are very quick to reprimand you.unless you have a lot of patience , go early in the am and on weekdays to avoid long queues. The remainder of the complex is lovely to see, the palace from outside and views of the simple life Ho Chi Min chose to live in his simple home and his stilts house. All viewed from outside through glass but here it's allowed to take photographs. If you don't have long queue for mausoleum about one and half hrs will be sufficient here .

Some of the wait is covered to protect from the sun, but some isn't, so be prepared to cover up during your wait. Once entering the actual building, you get moved along by the guards. No one is allowed to stop, or talk. It's all explained on signs as you enter the building. You shuffle past the body - just looks like he's asleep and looks VERY good for the years since his passing.I found getting out of the grounds and back to my bag a bit confusing. You can't go back the way you came, so you have to go through the grounds to get back to the place you handed your bag in. I didn't want to see the grounds, but as a foreigner, was being asked to pay to see them. I just wanted my bag! So I snuck through the Vietnamese free gate in order to get back to the start. The grounds were pretty, and you could easily spend a couple of hours in there. Worth a visit if in Hanoi - such respect shown for the man."

He looks like he's just fallen asleep, and you get a few seconds to view him before you are ushered along to exit the interior.Then you can see his office and living quarters and also the humble stilt house he had built for himself later, with the openair office underneath.An appropriately sedate monument to one of Vietnam's heroes, and the founder of the modern State, but I couldn't help wondering what he would make of the current state of Vietnam, which to all intents and purposes is now a (successful) single party capitalist State."

Once through the airport style security, your camera will have to be dropped off at a left luggage along with any food etc. Water is not permitted and will be thrown away. Once though security, you snake through the Ho Chi Minh museum - where you mix with all the other tourists there, so much for security. You snake round to the front of the Mausoluem, where you enter at ground level in the center amongst much csremony from the guards dressed in white. They take this very seriously and there will be no infraction of the rules and serious demeanour. You go inside, up several staircases -there is a lift for the disabled -and are ushered into the small central vault where he lis, lit very dimly with yellow lights on his face and hands.

Of course to enter there , despite ticket price, there were lots of rules and regulations to follow, such as cannot wear short, cannot take photo, cannot wear sunglasses.. The tour guide will tell u all of these.The next is to visit his cars. The president car, which is a bullet proof one, was given by Soviet Union. Then he had another 2 cars, one of them was given by the people of Vietnam, it was a Peugeot. Lastly we visited the uncle Ho's previous home. The stayed in 2 different houses which were not far apart. The visitors were not allow to enter the house, everything was preserved as what they been. We only can peep from the window, it was rather simple and never a palace looking. We get a long story about him, and all the sacrifices being done to bring the country along the journey of independent. It is a place that worth visiting, that's why 5 stars be awarded."

It is cheap and offers nice garden-like area to stroll around and visit the few points of interest inside. Arrive early because the mausoleum closes at 11 AM.Ho Chi Minh's body itself is better maintained than Mao's in Beijing. Overall, the room with the coffin is somewhat more beautiful and mysterious than Mao's own place. One should remain quiet and keep slowly walking through it.If you have a big camera you must leave it before entering the mausoleum. You will get it back right after exiting and it will be kept in secure place. They also confiscate your water bottles and them you will NOT get back.

Tickets are only available in the morning until about 9 or 9.30am. To avoid disappointment it's best to check online to see if the Mausoleum is open, and the cut-off time for tickets. Once you have your ticket, you join the long line/queue to make your way into the building. Bags, backpacks, purses, cameras are not allowed in the Mausoleum, and you have to check them in with security. I was fortunate to join up with a friendly tour group, so I left my bag etc. with their belongings which worked out well. As we got closer to the entrance, there was an increasing sense of reverence and importance. The interior of this enormous building was very cool, with an eerie silence. Uniformed guards stood at every corner and quietly directed visitors to the auditorium where 'Uncle Ho', as his followers liked to call him, lay resting under a glass dome. It was quite incredible to actually see this iconic figure who passed away 48 years ago! On exiting the Mausoleum, the tour guide fielded our many questions about the history of Vietnam. The combination of viewing Ho Chi Minh and having a very knowledgable guide, make this a really memorable experience for me."

But the complex is quite large and we did see his house, which had many of his personal items on display. He lived in a wooden house in the style of the countryside, not the large presidential palace built by the French. The One Pillar pagoda wad also under restoration, but you could walk up and take a photo. The day we went there, hundreds of school children in their blue and white uniforms were there to sightsee."

Ho Chi's body leaves once a year for 2 months to Russia for re embalming, so try to go see him when he is there. The whole complex is fantastic, the museum there is great, an emotional and moving experience. Take at least half a day to see it all, the queue that you have to walk in to get into the mausoleum is very long, but moves quickly, and as it is not just for tourists this place but locals,and many Vietnamese that have travelled all over the country to see it, you can interact a bit with them as you wait. I wouldn't say this is a 'tourist' attraction as such, as it is not for tourists specifically. A great visit, if you have time for only one attraction in Ha Noi, even all of Vietnam, then make it this one. Don't miss it whatever you do, even just see Ho Chi if you are time poor. Fantastic!!!"

The mausoleum is a really great excursion to go on if you are interested in learning about Ho Chi Minh and are willing to wait in line. If you plan to go, you should be prepared for long queues in hot and humid weather. You are able to bring a camera, but you must leave your belongings at the entrance when going to the mausoleum. You also go through a scanner, so bring disposable water and money so that you can buy water on the other side. Due to the importance of Ho Chi Minh, the mausoleum is highly busy and is only open at certain hours, so research times to go and book ahead! I went in the morning and had to wait 3 hours in 34 degree heat. Thankfully, shade to stand under is provided but large bags and cameras are not allowed within the actual mausoleum. You only have a small amount of time to pay your respects, and are chaperoned around by guards, but once you have visited his mausoleum you have more freedom to visit the presidential palace, Ho Chi Minh's home and he museum dedicated to him.You can only see the palace from afar, but are able to get closer to his house. It was very crowded when I went, and the children who were there seemed to be thoroughly uninterested. The museum was also very crowded, but interesting to go round. It isn't very large, so only takes about 30 - 45 minutes to see. Overall, it was a highly interesting experience, but quite tiring from all the walking and heat. I wouldn't recommend it to those who aren't interested in the history of the country or those who have children. Otherwise, it is a unique - if not eerie - sight to see."

History suggests that Ho Chi Minh requested a cremation but the public demand was such that the authorities chose to commemorate him in traditional Soviet style a la Lenin. As it turned out the mausoleum was undergoing it's annual shutdown for maintenance during our visit and so we were only able to view the main building from afar. The building itself appeared to be designed to make a statement of grandeur and to my western eyes appear to err on the brutalist style. Fortunately, in the company of our Buffalo guide, Springy, we were able to gather a detailed understanding of the affection still harboured for 'Uncle Ho' who apparently is still regarded as an extension of the family by many Vietnamese. He's certainly a character that I intend to investigate in more detail - by all accounts very well traveled and a deep thinker who looked to combine his travel experiences to create a way of life to which he adhered. Although the mausoleum was closed, the gardens and his former residences were all open for inspection. I was particularly impressed by how simple and humble these were for someone wielding such power - whilst the accommodation was very nice there was no overt ostentation as one might expect of such a prominent person. I particularly loved the polished hardwood residence situated next to the carp pond. I found myself thinking of him more in terms of Gandhi or Mandela - one of those rare people who preach reasonable things and actually practice what they preach.There were some well preserved state vehicles on hand to reflect the past - a Peugot from French colonial times and a fine pair of Russian models that I didn't recognise.Overall, well worth the visit."

We booked a tour to the Ho Chi Minh complex with a local student guide - an amazing experience in itself. We visited the mausoleum and the compound right around the Vietnamese independence day - that meant a lot of activity in the mausoleum. Our guide told us people nearly do pilgrimage to the place. Afterwards we looked around in the compound, and ultimately at the museum - which was really biased, BUT it is part of the experience of Vietnam - another guide we had in Vietnam kept talking in loving terms about Uncle Ho, and it seems that he is a figure that all Vietnamese can come together around - all of our guides - some rural farmer girls others middle class hanoians, who were deeply political different could all express the same feelings toward this man, who has been placed in the mausoleum against his will. One has to bear in mind when visiting both the mausoleum and the museum that this image is the one the Vietnamese know - and how much one may disagree with the political propaganda, one cannot discharge that Uncle Ho is essential for anyone who wishes to understand the Vietnam of today."

According to a local would-be motor-cycle guide, Ho Chi Minh was off with Lenin enjoying a vodka. This legend, urban or otherwise, was lent credibility by the complete closure of the streets and straits around the tomb itself, forcing visitors to flock into the fabulous historical museum and the adjacent One Pillar Pagoda in the immediate vicinity.At other times, an early morning vigil and a long wait will allow you access to the great man's apparent remains, and for appropriate homage to occur. Once again, there are urban legends: one guide is heard to say the remains are real; others are adamant they are 'plastic' or at any rate a facsimile. none of this matters, as you are there to pay obeisance in respectful silence, and the result is always awe-inducing.The Diplomantic and Governmental avenues around the Mausoleum are wide and aeroplanes bearing presidents and dignitaries land there, moments away from the pumpkin-coloured ministries that surround the mausoleum. In the evenings the plaza becomes a flood of locals out to exercise within a stone's throw of their great leader's gaze. Ba Dinh Square is one of Hanoi's great public spaces.The ethnography surrounding the mausoleum with its Vietnamese-styled neoclassicism is as fascinating as the site itself. Modelled on Lenin's mausoleum between 1973 and 1975, the austere stonework shines in dark greys and flashes of red. Visitors are to dress respectfully, as they should for a visit to any pagoda or other shrine or site of worship, and to avoid any clothing that stops above the knees.Photograph yourself and your family, but, remember: \"N\u01b0\u1edbc C\u1ed9ng H\u00f2a X\u00e3 H\u1ed9i Ch\u1ee7 Ngh\u0129a Vi\u1ec7t Nam Mu\u00f4n N\u0103m\"."

( we were in the part that wasnt going to get the cut :( .Third time we book it part of a day tour around Ha noi which include a few other places as well, we get in through the tour entrance ( no line ). but once inside it was worth it, get to see the National Hero, very strict inside though like no camera, check your bag and stuff. Definitely a place to see if you visit Ha noi. If you want to see it without going in a tour I recommend get here at 5 30am and be the first to get in, nice weather for a morning walk as well :D"

The controls at the entrance resemble the ones at the airport (there might be long queues), the rules inside are very strict, no stopping, no talking, you walk in a line around the glass showcase and are surprised, how tiny he actually looks compared to all the statues around Vietnam. The actual visit inside the mausoleum lasts only a few minutes, I would appreciate more time to take a good look. :) The men standing on guard looked really great in their formal uniforms."

The mausoleum is a really great excursion to go on if you are interested in learning about Ho Chi Minh and are willing to wait in line. If you plan to go, you should be prepared for long queues in hot and humid weather. You are able to bring a camera, but you must leave your belongings at the entrance when going to the mausoleum. You also go through a scanner, so bring disposable water and money so that you can buy water on the other side. Due to the importance of Ho Chi Minh, the mausoleum is highly busy and is only open at certain hours, so research times to go and book ahead! I went in the morning and had to wait 3 hours in 34 degree heat. Thankfully, shade to stand under is provided but large bags and cameras are not allowed within the actual mausoleum. You only have a small amount of time to pay your respects, and are chaperoned around by guards, but once you have visited his mausoleum you have more freedom to visit the presidential palace, Ho Chi Minh's home and he museum dedicated to him.You can only see the palace from afar, but are able to get closer to his house. It was very crowded when I went, and the children who were there seemed to be thoroughly uninterested. The museum was also very crowded, but interesting to go round. It isn't very large, so only takes about 30 - 45 minutes to see. Overall, it was a highly interesting experience, but quite tiring from all the walking and heat. I wouldn't recommend it to those who aren't interested in the history of the country or those who have children. Otherwise, it is a unique - if not eerie - sight to see."

            "review": "One of the few reminders you are in a Communist Country. Much of the time you're in Vietnam, as a visitor at least, there's nothing conspicuously 'communist' to be seen, other than the occasional Soviet-style artwork posters in the streets and on roadsides. Many years ago I visited some of the old Eastern Block while the Soviets were very open and proud of their control of their neighbours (that said we're seeing glimpses of this again in Ukraine) and more recently went to Cuba, so I thought I had an idea of what a typical Communist State looked like. I didn't expect Vietnam to look like Czechoslovakia in the early 80's as even today's Czechoslovakia doesn't look anything like the old Soviet controlled Czechoslovakia (it doesn't even exist as one Country) but I was expecting it to be rather more like Cuba in some respects. Economically Vietnam puts Cuba firmly in the shade and looks like it's out-performing many of its non-communist neighbours too. While the Vietnamese are quite open about their dislike of China (more so than the US or France) they appear to be following their economic approach faithfully and very successfully. So when visiting Ho Chi Minh in his mausoleum (he was I understand preserved in Moscow and has been returned there every so often for repair work) it came as a bit of a surprise to be told to walk in twos and to keep our arms at our sides and not to even whisper by the many guards lining the route. I could see the frustration in their faces as they had to repeatedly tell the vaguely interested tourists to show more respect. I was half expecting to be instructed to walk in step with my partner. Ho Chi Minh is clearly, and for very obvious reasons, still highly revered by the Vietnamese. Apparently he wanted to be cremated when he died and have his ashes scattered throughout the land, but the Government wouldn't allow this and had him preserved instead and put on permanent display for future generations to visit and pay thanks to (and now tourists, but I doubt they thought about that at the time). I suspect this was a very wise move by the Communist elite as Ho Chi Minh will remain the leader of their Nation in perpetuity and the people continue admiring what he fought for, believed in and accepting of the form of government he imposed. Consequently, to criticise the government is to criticise Ho himself, and what self-respecting Vietnamese is likely to do that?"

The crowd waiting, then slowly walking towards the Mausoleum is disciplined. In true communistic order everyone stays in line and obeys the order of the guards in detail. They tell you to be quiet, to stay in line, to bring your arms from behind your back to you sides in honor of the embalmed person whom you will see shortly for a few moments. Is it the real Ho Chi Min or maybe an imitation? No one wants to answer this question. However, this body is preserved in a cooled hall. For many Vietnamese Ho Chi Min remains a hero.The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum is located in the center of Ba Dinh Square, which is the place where the chairman of the Communist Party of Vietnam from 1951 until his death in 1969 lived. Here he read the Declaration of Independence, establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This mausoleum was ranked as the \"sixth most ugly\" building in the world by CNN International in 2012. Was it worth the waiting in line? Yes \u2013 to get a bit closer to understand communism."

I tried to explain to them about Bac Ho, how great he was as a person and a leader of the country and what the mausoleum was used for (before, during, and after the visit). I hope my children would remember some of it until the next time we have chance to visit it again."

There is always a daunting line, but don't worry, it goes fast. Make sure not to bring a big backpack and they don't like big cameras, either. I had a small purse and a point-and-shoot that was fine. You shuffle along orderly and then when you reach the mausoleum white uniformed military guards make sure nobody loiters. Ho Chi Minh is encased in glass and has a yellow tinge to his skin. It's all quite peaceful, if not a little macabre. Afterwards foreigners have to buy a ticket to see his stilt house, the President's palace, his cars and the gardens he used to walk. Then there is the Ho Chi Minh museum which is filled with old photos and symbolic exhibits. That part was not my favorite. Everyone was screaming, kids were running wild and I found it hard to concentrate. Oh well. It is a very special place for the Vietnamese. Tons of souvenirs to buy afterwards. Uncle Ho goes to Russia every fall for 3 months to get freshened up, so check to make sure he's home before you go!"

Seeing his body in person made this experience seem quite special and brought understanding of all the museums dedicated to this one leader. It's not every day you can view a mummified world leader so I emphasise the importance of waking up early and going to the mausoleum.

We arrived to find a fair number of Vietnamese families making their way across the park towards the nightly lit Mausoleum, in front of which the guards were standing by a large the flag pole where the Vietnamese flag fluttered in the warm wind. At 9 pm on the dot revolutionary music was played through the loud speakers, and the ceremony began. I was impressed by the way the large crowd of people (I did not see another foreigner) stood behind a white line painted on the ground without surging forward, with only a young soldier standing on the other side of the line seemingly in complete control of the situation. The ceremony involved lowering the flag and the soldiers marching around the square taking exaggerated steps in exact time with the music playing from the loud speakers. It was sombre, and I found it moving in that the people around me were obviously taking this act of national pride very seriously. Afterwards, my friend and I, along with many others, crossed the line and wondered across the square to the front of the Mausoleum, where I had my picture taken and where I took pictures of the children and families playing in the square. I would like to visit the Mausoleum during the day and wait in line to see Ho Chi Min's preserved body, but that will have to wait till another time.

Incredible!Actually, it is an odd feeling when you are ushered into the room where Ho Chi Minh is entombed by military officers in full dress - silence is strictly enforced and a hushed awe befalls the room as you file around his final resting place. Much more awe-inspiring than I thought possible.p.s. The staff throughout the grounds are crabby; just ignore them and have a nice time wandering the grounds and enjoying the scenery."

If you've ever been to Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow then it's (purposefully) startlingly similar.

Coincidentally, this was also the day that Ho died in 1969 . The embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh is preserved in the cooled, central hall of the mausoleum. Construction work began on September 2, 1973, and the structure was formally inaugurated on August 29, 1975.

The exterior is made of gray granite, while the interior is gray, black, and red polished stone. The mausoleum's portico has the words \"Ch\u1ee7 t\u1ecbch H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh\" (Chairman Ho Chi Minh) inscribed across it.

There is a lot of shade and some fans, but you are not allowed water so I recommend drinking as much as possible during the initial stages of queuing. The military officers will temporarily take your cameras, make sure you do not talk on your phone, and make sure your hands are by your sides and you walk in an orderly fashion. I think many of the locals found this a hassle but I enjoyed the discipline and the way the Vietnamese respect the process as much as Uncle Ho himself. The whole thing felt like a wholly pilgrimage for Vietnamese.Uncle Ho is quite hard to see, and you don't get long to look, but for me the beauty of was the experience itself. The parade grounds outside have a very imposing feel to them, but coming from the west I loved it, we have nothing like that where I come from. Remember to wear clothes that cover your shoulders, and for ladies, remember to wear pants, as you will be asked to leave the queue if you have shorts on.There are vendors to the left of the queue once inside that sell pants and scarves to don't panic if you forget, just pop over there and then re-join the queue."

So, in the interests of paying respects to a leader much loved by his country we joined the long queue to visit the mausoleum. The queue seemed very long when we first joined it and at various intervals there are requirements you have to abide by, like a bag drop off point and a location where cameras and video cameras of a certain size and type are handed in under a ticketing system. I had a smaller hand held camera and was allowed to progress with it but on the strict understanding no pictures. Which I was always going to respect. The queue actually moves very quickly so the wait is not that long. Soon we were entering the mausoleum building and being ushered along at a pace by the white uniformed guards. Ho Chi Minh's body is on display and you get a few minutes sight of it before the flow takes you out of the building and away. All done fairly respectfully, if having your body on display to the public is deemed respectful. After leaving the mausoleum you can walk round to the other side of the yard area in front to grab some pictures, near where the large flagpole is located with the huge Vietnamese flag on display. I have rated this fairly highly here as the Vietnamese worshipped, and still do, their former leader and this mausoleum allows many nationals to visit.

I had a lot of respect for the man so my husband and i were determined to visit thie Mausoleum.Be prepared for LONG LINES. The mausoleum is only open for a few hours each day and the lines are just unbelievably long but everyone stands very patiently. Most of the people i would say 95% are Vietnamese as they loved this man. We stood out in the crowd since we were from India and looked different. Yet i have to say the people of Vietnam are very kind. We could not speak their language and they could not understand us as we spoke English but the kindness they showed us just warmed my heart. We are in our 70;s and it started to rain and the couple behind us pulled us under their umbrellas so that we would not get wet. When the lady found that the four of us could not fit under one umbrella she tapped the gentleman in front who had an umbrella for himself (he had not noticed us getting soaking wet) and told him to take me under his umbrella which he did very willingly and all this without a word being spoken only gestures. I will never forget this experience, and i have to say we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to this beautiful country."

Visiting mausoleum keep on mind that you have to behave with respect - no photos are allowed, you can't stop - just keep walking in a queue around Ho Chi Minh - and your arms have to be all the time along your body - no crossing them or so - otherwise militars will take immediately care of you. When you exit mausoleum you will follow the crowd and get to Ho Chi Minh residence and garden. As a foreigner you have to pay entrance fee - meanwhile all locals are passing freely around. I did not understand what am I obliged to do there when I was stopped by militar - and when I asked he was not polite at all - rather screem at me pointing I have to pay (and it really took me a while to understand why I have to pay). However it's worth to visit this site."

We went on the weekend of Reunification/Liberation Day, so the queue was incredibly long, but it moved very quickly and was very well organised. Some locals were (of course) blatantly pushing in but the guards very quickly put a stop to it. The site is well set out, the building very impressive, and it was a very interesting experience to visit. Don't wear shorts on or above the knee or you'll be forced to buy a US$5 scarf to cover them up. Cameras are taken off you and you collect upon exiting the building."

I arrived at 7.55 a.m., the visit starts at 8 a.m., I was the 10th person in line, the line moves very fast and people are quiet and respectful. After one enters and walks up a few steps, one sees the glass casket of Ho Chi Minh lying in state, the line moves fast and quietly around the casket , at a certain distance, but one can view the face of Ho chi Minh well, from the left, the front, the right, and then the tour takes one down some steps and out. It all goes very fast. I loved the visit, because one can observe the people of Vietnam who come to pay Ho Chi Minh respect. Soldiers in white uniforms stand guard and help elderly people up the steps. Even if one comes later, the line moves fast. During opening hours of the mausoleum from 8 to 11 a.m. every day, one cannot go to the front and take pictures. After the mausoleum one can visit the home of Ho chi Minh and admire the French governor's palace in a beautiful park."

I don't know about you but gazing no matter how reverentially on the preserved remains of a human being does absolutely nothing for me.The last time I was here, his remains had been sent to Moscow for a periodic service so it wasn't open. Neither is it open on Fridays or between 11.30 and 1.30 pm each day.On arrival and alighting from our bus we were fed into a gigantic conga line which progressed about 500m at a steady rate from the back of the precinct around the side and along the big square in front of the mausoleum. There are occasional pauses while they do a shift change of the guards.Inside the tomb all is dimmed light and hushed tone with the white uniform guards ushering folks though, ensuring people remove hats and don't talk; one moves by the glass walled enclosure and out the other side.I couldn't help feeling that a Madam Tussaud effigy in a standing pose delivering the oratory that caused the site to be selected, would be a more compelling mark of respect.But that's only my opinion.The adjacent park and 'house on stilts' was also jam packed meaning the conga line continued.I had been before when it was quieter and it was much more enjoyable."

Some Vietnamese people just tried to cut in front of us on a few occasions and we had to be assertive in order to prevent this. You walk for ages through strict security and eventually get to the mausoleum with guard every few steps and get to walk around Ho's body. I found it a bit weird but he looks great for someone who has been dead for 45 years. He just looks asleep. You walk around, look at him and leave.Glad I went but wouldn't have gone if it wasn't free."

After seeing Ho Chi Minh himself you'll also get to walk around the old presidential palace, his modest house of stilts and see a collection of his old cars. If I had to sum it up I'd have to say its a weird mix between an army parade ground and Disney land! Not sure how Uncle Ho would feel about Pepsi being the refreshment option of choice for example.

But even if the queue seems endless as it was the case when I went, it goes really fast so don't be discouraged.Be prepared though:1) lareg bags (that included my normal day backpack) can be pulled out and asked to be left at the cloak room at the entrance. that means that to get it back you will have to walk all the way from the exit along the outside walls from the opposite side of the entrance ... and it closes at 10h30...2) large cameras are also taken away at a different point before reaching the mausoleum - getting it back is very easy though, straight after exiting the mausoleum itself.3) be decently covered, do not show to much skin, shoulders should be covered.it is possible to take pictures near the mausoleum (except when your camera has been taken away.....) but not inside.NOTE: if you want to see the mausoleum without getting inside (personally, I did not think it was worth the hassle but...), just ask a taxi to drop you on the opposite side of the entrance, near the laws. you can get close to the mausoleum without a ticket and take as many pics as you want."

Really very unique compared to home, like an eternal wake/visitation versus just one day. Just by observing we learned a lot about the reverence held for HCM even today. Worth the few dollar cab ride from the Old Town, especially when accompanied by a visit to another attraction on the grounds. After our visit, we took a leisurely walk back to the Old Town (bring your map!) stopping for lunch at a delicious Hue-inspired restaurant along the way. Logistics: Wear LONG pants (no skin, not even calves/ankles) and avoid sleeveless shirts. Arrive early, the line is long (though it moves quickly) and the last entrance when we were there was around 10:15. We had a bit of a hard time finding the entrance line to the mausoleum....

One can see clearly how much respect the Vietnamese people hold for Ho Chi Minh or \"Uncle Ho\". Ho Chi Minh had stated in his will that he wanted to be cremated but somehow, his followers altered this will and with help from the Soviet Union, preserved his body.

Slowly winding through the corridors, steps and other we came out in HCM\u2019s the chamber then around it and wow out the other side just as quick shuffled as we came. Its very regimented, very controlled and don\u2019t even stop on the grounds outside or the security will swarm you way to hurry you along.I hear you ask \u201cWHY am I of two minds, the above sounds like I didn\u2019t like it\u201d\u2026 well, the reality is I liked it for the experience, it opened my eyes to the transcending veneration and adoration the Vietnamese and the Government have for HCM and what he did for the country. Where I think it falls short is that it really isn\u2019t anything but a Mausoleum. If you want to learn about the man that was, or what he did you have to find it elsewhere.Expect long lines as its basically single file. They confiscate cameras and phones at the entrance and you pick them up at the exit on the other side of the complex. For my two cents, it was worth the 1-2 hours but if you a lucky enough to visit when they have any of the military honours or parades in the front square the experience will probably be better again. oh and wait around for the changing of the guards if you can as this is military precision in full dress like the movies."

The actual part where you file silently through the room past the corpse is brief, for me the real interest was all the ceremonial ritual surrounding the mausoleum, the gorgeously-uniformed guards (stick around to watch the fancy snappy marching when they change shifts with a new team), the rules about visitors' dress and conduct, the solemnity with which the whole area is managed (actually the whole city block, around which you have to walk the long way, twice, to get to the distant entrance to join the queue and then to retrieve your bag from locker room), and watching the reverence of the local visitors towards this man of incredible vision but who presided over so much oppression and suffering. Really worthwhile to try to get some insight into the attitudes of all those local people in whose homes you will see a Ho Chi Minh portrait in a prime position on the wall.

Eventually you are shuffled in silence by stern looking white suited guards into the mausoleum itself. To see Ho Chi Minh lying in state is a little unbelievable but there he is. To me it was a fascinating piece of history, there lies this man I knew little about yet the name Ho Chi Minh is so familiar from my childhood. You can't take photos and respect is key, it it's a very interesting insight into the communist state and cult of personality that exists here."

We had to line up outside the mausoleum, 2 single lines, caps/hats off, bags scanned and searched as we made our way into the depths of the mausoleum under the watchful eyes of white uniformed guards/soldiers at every point.Once in the main chamber where Uncle Ho serenely lies in state it was surreal.

For close to two months every year, somewhere between September to November, the mausoleum has to close down and the body of Ho Chi Minh sent to Russia for maintenance (yes, the embalmment needs maintenance). So it definitely would be wise to check ahead with your tour agency or hostel clerk regarding the mausoleum's closure if you are visiting during those months. Interestingly for us though, both the tour guides and hostel receptionists knew that the mausoleum was closed for maintenance but not when it would reopen. Fortunately for us though, the mausoleum reopened on the last day of our trip.There will always be locals (as well as some foreigners) cutting the queue past the shuffling throng, indifferent and oblivious to the indignant glare of foreigners, so be patient with these people. Long the queue may be, but at least it was moving albeit at a snail's pace.The interior of the mausoleum was not vast, surprising considering the size of the mausoleum from the outside. However the corridors were wide enough to accommodate two abreast with much room to spare. We noticed that the interior was rather dimly lit and cold, lending an even grimmer and dour sense of the place. Honor guards stood at intervals along the path, silently staring at passersby with an air of indifference.We entered a rather small area where everyone's attention was fixed on the dais in the middle of the room. Encased within a glass sarcophagus was the body of Ho Chi Minh, the nation's leader. He looked rather serene, lying within the sarcophagus with hands clasped and sandals on as if asleep, with only the waxy face betraying a hint of his embalmment.It took us more than 30 minutes to reach the heart of Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum but less than 5 to walk past the body of the deceased leader. Most guides will recommend in a short sentence one other event to witness while visiting Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum - the changing of guards. I however recommended strongly to be there at the right time to witness it.Is there mausoleum worth visiting? I would say it depends on your purpose. One may not hold much interest in the bygone communist days of Vietnam of for the deceased leader of this nation, but the monument itself is such a landmark of Hanoi that one could barely claim that one has visited the city without snapping a photo in front of the edifice. Following the queue may not be necessary for most, if you are only there to take a picture of the gray facade."

This place is laden with guards who are quick to call you out for anything but not overly pushy, just no talking, hands out of pockets, & no pictures...that sort of thing. Other than that the whole complex is kinda weak. You can only go through the Mausoleum, Ho's house, the other houses he worked and lived in, or the museum ONCE...basically once you are herded through with the other countless groups you eventually walk out the back exit and that is it. I can understand how this would be a great trip for local Vietnamese but we were basically going just to see his preserved body (which is remarkably preserved having died in 1969). Other than that it was kind of dull. The museum is hard to follow as most of the displays are not translated."

Whilst in the queue though we noticed a young girl sweeping up leaves and if one was to fall this was quickly dealt with - the grounds were emaculate and lovely to look at whilst waiting. Obviously this monument is very well guarded and you have to be so careful as you have to 'cover up' arms and not wear shorts above the knee. Went entering you are not allowed to speak and must keep moving which is watched over by the guards - all very smart in their white uniforms. Once inside you file past the body of 'Uncle Ho' but you are not allowed to stop for a second as you are ushered on. I found the experience to be very moving although regimented. Afterwards we walked around the grounds and then made our way to the one pillar pagoda. Well worth a visit as it's history that we remember."

I have to say the queue moved very quickly and it really didn't take long. For me it was the experience rather than just seeing the old chap lying there. The communist state really came out. I kept getting told to stand right next to my wife while walking in the queue and if we moved away slightly were told to stand together. If we moved slightly out of line or dropped back very slightly they were quickly on it telling us to move along. I found myself doing it deliberately just to annoy them. They did take my camera off me before we entered but they did let me take quite a big bag in after they checked there was nothing in it. I did have an iphone in my pocket but think it would have been a big mistake to take it out while I was in there. Photos weren't a problem outside.

Stuffs related to ho chi minh...everything is about him.What to see outside the mausoleum?Foods and drinksGardens and thats it.If you prefer for just sightseeing, the place is ok...but if you dont want to have a long walk and if its ok with you not take pictures as your remembrace to everything you see, the place is fine too. But not that memorable in my own opinion. But we have to respect their customs and their society for what they think is the right thing to do with regards of their property.But i think i wont recomend that place for my friends.

As for dress code, I had longer cargo shorts and a t-shirt which were fine, but one friend with above knee shorts was turned away."

The dress code is strict - shoulders and back covered, clothes to at least knees etc. You must also check in backpacks, large bags, and water to the free luggage check in. The complex is only open from 830 to around 11am so timing is important. I get there around 930am and join the long queue. All up, it's probably 1km or so of queuing under shaded awning. Luckily today it was busy but we moved forward at a slow walking pace rather than being stopped. It ends up being a scenic and leisurely stroll through the park grounds so it's not too bad.I watch the changing of the guards in their crisp white uniforms, bayonets, and sharply defined steps. Entering the Mausoleum we are gestured by guards to remove hats and be silent. We file through the marblesque tomb past Ho Chi Minh embalmed and under spotlight. He looks rather like a wax figure from Madam Tussaud's. I don't know why people say it's creepy; I thought it was very reverent.I loved the moment when the guards around Uncle Ho changed and two of the young men smiled at each other as they swapped. The young guy struggled for a few moments to swap the smile for a Buckingham Palace guard type look and had to keep his face ducked down; I'm not sure if anyone else noticed.From there, we file outside and follow the path through the grounds. The Presidential Palace is viewed from the outside as is the Stilt House - though the windows are open so that we can view the interior. It looks homey and I can see why it would be more comfortable living there by the lake then in the palace."

So, one can think that this is closed from October through December. If you have valuables, you will have to check EVERYTHING before entering. I felt uneasy leaving my expensive camera and accessories as well as cell phone with security and then getting a numbered chip in order to reclaim them. It is efficient, fast and painless. I have NEVER heard of a theft of any item during this check in.Inside the entrance and through the meandering stairs, they are picky about how you comport yourself: no hands behind your back, always showing, silence or the lowest whisper ever, and you can not stop! Seeing the body in the glass enclosure, fresh, clear and clean, was an \"unreal\" experience with the body of Ho Chi Minh seemingly floating just above the bottom of the 8-foot tall enclosure, the body is at the lowest level and, right after that, one climbs up and out and into an open area where items are claimed and the experience completed.Imagine if George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, John F Kennedy or Martin Luther King, Jr. Were entombed and you were able to see them floating in clear embalming fluid. It is a deep experience and, for the Vietnamese, Ho Chi Minh is equivalent to how we revere those I mentioned earlier.Worth going and there is no fee that I can remember."

But as long as you put your camera in your bag you are fine. They have guards watching you at all times. The line to the Mausoleum is LONG but moves quite fast. There really is no signs of the rules so when you get to security check point you get told things. I must say the staff at the Mausoleum are very unfriendly and rude. I asked a question and they just pushed me on or completely ignored me, this happened twice to me. They yelled at people for doing something they didn't know they weren't suppose to do. This is the first thing you do when you get to the whole Ho Chi Minh Complex and it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I must say they are efficient when you go in the Mausoleum and the Mausoleum is impressive. It is kind of peaceful walking through but it is very fast and then you are ushered out again. It is free and interesting to visit just beware of the guards and don't let the line scare you it really isn't that long of a wait."

There seemed to be a number of different queues and some where having their bags checked, others (like us) when through with our bags and no one blinked.Single file you are ushered into the main room and there he is, lying in state, surrounded by guards who usher you along - you can't stop moving nor can you take pictures (that would be rather morbid though).No entrance fee so if you are up and about early, you have to go and see him."

One gent with us was taken aside and his camera confiscated until the guards were satisfied he had taken no photos of \"Uncle Ho\". Otherwise it was worth the effort of going.

Fair enough, we accept the NO Camera stuff, but we were also directed by an armed soldier to remove our sunglasses as we approached the building. Why? Loosen up guys, some of us actually appreciate what Uncle Ho did for this country, but we don't need to feel like you would detain us if you felt the luminescence of his embalmed majesty was somehow diminished by our Maui Jims."

If you have the time you can walk here from the Old Quarter, taking in the interesting district nearby which houses all the foreign embassies styled according to their national traditions. Just head for Dien Bien Phu Road, checking out the statue of Lenin on your left and then zig zag up some of the side streets as you walk towards the Mausoleum. Take care to be early though as the Mausoleum admits it's last visitors at 10.15am and many tour buses dump dozens of sight seers. If you take a taxi, don't be alarmed when they drive past the Mausoleum, because the entry is around the back, where you will have to check in your backpack and other items. Take care to find out the latest time you can collect your belongings or you may have to come back another time. Cameras are allowed, but no photographs are permitted within the Mausoleum itself. After purchasing your ticket you can walk along a covered footpath but will then have to line up in the open for many metres to wait for admission in very small groups. If it is raining and you have no protection, you WILL be soaked. Wear modest clothing and behave respectfully otherwise you will be ejected.The building itself is an imposing Soviet style concrete edifice with plenty of attendants ensuring security and decorum. You will need to shuffle silently through the dimly lit chamber housing the vestige of the man himself and he is surrounded by no less than eight stiff guards all immaculately dressed in white, and seriously armed. No stopping is allowed. Having passed away in the late 70's, Uncle Ho is looking a bit pasty these days, even though his body is apparently sent annually to Russia for an embalming touch up. No disrespect intended. Afterwards wander through some nicely kept gardens and perhaps check out the nearby Ho Chi Minh Museum and One Pillar Pagoda."

All you really do is wake up really early, line up for kilometres (the line moves quickly), get shepherded through the tomb by guards, then spend ten minutes trying to figure out how to leave the grounds without going through the artifact museum. Nevertheless, we had a great time lining up with the thousands of Vietnamese people coming to check Ho Chi Minh out, and I would recommend going to anybody visiting Hanoi.DEFINITELY go as early as you can. We got there at 7:30 and the line was already absurdly long. Also, make sure to cover your knees and shoulders, and try to avoid bringing a bag."

It is just a small structure, with a big square in front of it. Umbrella or hat is important as shrubs around the mausoleum were not enough to provide shelter from stinging sun. Learned from other reviewers, the queue into the mausoleum can be stunningly long. So, drinking water might be necessary while we battle through the queue.The mausoleum was closed on Friday as well as on Monday. My family and I didn't go into the mousoleum as our visit was on Friday. However, taking photo outside was allowed. The trip to mausoleum should be done together with other places nearby such as Hanoi Botanical Garden, One Pillar Pagoda, and Hanoi Royal Citadel.Hanoi Botanical Garden next to the mausoleum is really worth a visit, as it houses the stilt house of Ho Chi Minh. The story about how uncle Ho refused presidential palace and lived in the stilt house was touching- that's what the real leader should be. The trip to Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum is not complete without visiting Ho Chi Minh stilt house. More of my experience is available at bettyandlingshing.blogspot.com/2013/05/ho-chi-minh-mausoleum-and-places-nearby.html."

When visiting the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi, Vietnam, be prepared for 2 hour queues ....unless of course you are visiting in a wheelchair, and then be prepared for a full on military escort all the way through! If you are travelling in a wheelchair let them know at the security checkpoint. You will then be asked to wait about 5 minutes, before someone comes to escort you past the mile long queue. You will then be met by 6 guards at the base of the Mausoleum, to be carried up the front stairs into the building. Be prepared for stares, as they are dressed in white, (mourning) full on military uniform, and cannot be ignored! You will then have this escort through the whole building. I was actually too busy trying to stifle giggles at this, (along with the guards), that I probably missed the significance of seeing the embalmed body.No photography is allowed, and no stopping is allowed. You will go in one side, and walk straight out of the other, in a long line of people. Do not try to visit on Fridays or Mondays as it is closed, which also means that it is twice as busy the day after. This is a must when visiting this city, but do be prepared. The only other time I've seen such queues is at the Vatican City."

The entire grounds of the mausoleum including the gardens is an impressive looking place and very expansive considering space is such a premium in Vietnam. Ho was lit with an eerie looking shade of red. My water bottle was confiscated at security screening, flow of pedestrian traffic to see Ho is one way only, but I needed to retrieve my water bottle so had to go the long way around. My advice is to leave your belongings with the numerous checkpoints that allow you to do so. On our way to get my water bottle we were shouted very aggressively 'BUY TICKET!' by some guy in a miliary-looking outfit, the tickets were for a tour guide at 25,000VND pp and I didn't see why I needed a guide. Looking around, nobody else was buying them, so I'm not sure if only foreigners were required to buy them as all the locals seemingly could leave without one, or if it was just some random dude dressed up trying to scam us, needless to say, we found another way out without having to buy a ticket. The employees in military garb do not speak any English, if you need to express something, speak to the ladies at the belonging checkpoints as they can translate and pass on the message for you as I had done. When I finally reached security screening and got my water bottle back, what I found unnecessary was that the man there had to escort me by arm out of there...I know which way I came from thank you very much. Also we saw many people wearing shorts and t-shirt, females also. Just look polished and you should be fine, we didn't take anything else besides water so that we didn't have to check in our things at belongings, so we wore long pants on a 35 degrees celsius day without something to change into (where are there any change rooms anyway) and within a few minutes we were wishing we had."

The mausoleum contains just his preserved body, which I found oddly moving to view. There was a decent-sized line to enter the mausoleum (which was free to enter) but it moved at walking pace and took just a couple of minutes to get in. There are plenty of rules to follow: - No tank tops - my wife brought a silk scarf to cover her shoulders - No photography inside - and we actually got told off for taking photos of guards outside so be careful there- You'll need to check your bags if they're bigger than a purse; same goes for DSLR cameras (we removed our memory card and took it with us to be safe, but had no problems) - you can reclaim them immediately upon exiting the mausoleum- Lonely Planet said no sandals or shorts but we wore sandals and saw lots of people in shorts The whole thing is over in a couple of minutes - there's just the one room with the closely guarded body - but I found it worthwhile."

I haven't see patriotism like this anywhere in the world except at Chairman Mao's former residence. The entire experience is great. First, you have to form a line just to enter the area where you form a line. This made no sense but set the tone perfectly for a trip to see a great Communist leader. We went through metal detectors, but I just kept my camera in my pocket. The detector alarmed but they weren't checking anyone. If you play by the rules, you are supposed to check in any camera or recording device and they will give it back to you afterwards. Seemed risky to me, so I kept mine in my pocket.

The taxi ride from not the old quarter was 50.000 dong - but unfortunately the taxi drivers drop you close to the mausoleum. Unfortunately the entrance is quite along way south west of there. Have your hostel point it out on the map and insist the driver drops you there.After our long walk to the entrance we got in line and went to the mausoleum with the other guests. I would go on a weekday as it gets crowded in the weekends. When going into the mausoleum stick to the left - and/or behind someone who is not too tall - so you get a clear view of Mr. Minh. YOu will only have about a minute to take it all in.Be respectful when visiting - you are a guest in Vietnam - so don't fool around and insult the armed guards. Follow the rules.Don't bring too much stuff as you have to hand it in at the gates -something I am always reluctant to do. No photography is allowed in the mausoleum itself.Remember the place has very limited opening hours (morning usually)After the mausoleum you can go to some buildings - if you are in a big group you may get in without paying the 25.000 Dong.

Well, they don't stop. once in the building you are ushered through and past the waxy remnants of the former leader at a steady pace. No photographs are allowed and you should remove your hat in reverence.It is chilly inside as they have to regulate the temperature. Also, the soldiers may take umbrage if you are wearing shorts and sandals. I had even heard of people not being let in with short sleeves but there was no evidence of this when I went. Vests were a definite no-no. Best to bring something long sleeved and light trousers just in case.A point worth noting is that you should leave your camera and water at the security check. They don't allow water or liquids to be taken in so unless you want to lose it, it is best to leave it behind for the time you are in there. In Hanoi, you don't want to be without water in summer particularly."

As much as I can appreciate the significance of this attraction for locals (they truly adored this man), for someone not impacted by his work or life it was hard to feel the significance. Our tour guide spoke about the modest life that this great man of Vietnam lived and the request that his ashes be spread under three mountains in different parts of Vietnam. Seeing his body in a grand Mausoleum seemed somewhat incongruent with the stories I heard about him alive."

The intimidating grey structure feels incongruent to the perfectly manicured grass that lies before it and the kind yellow buildings around it. And this is just the beginning.From the outset you're intimidated (as you rightly should be). Line up with other tourists to have you cameras confiscated until you re-emerge from visiting Uncle Ho's preserved body. Be sure to dress appropriately - visible shoulders and knees are disrespectful. Don't be one of *those* tourists.Once you've been ushered through in the single file queue, the actual walk through the room to see Uncle Ho is actually very short, seconds in fact. It is also extremely unsettling. Ho Chi Minh specifically requested that his remains be burnt, to be scattered across different regions of the country. That the government has gone against this express wish in the exact opposite, most garish way, affects many a visitor. You've been warned.Once out of the mausoleum, from there it's a short walk in to the neighbouring gardens of the President's Palace and HCM's old living quarters. Beautiful and worth the visit in summer especially.Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum is a very valuable experience as a tourist to really get a sense of Vietnamese culture in the north, and underlying political sensitivities, still very present today."

The flower garden at the backyard was also serene, specially the series of Bonsai. The low-key patriotic songs in the PA system praising HoChiMin added to the serenity of the place!"

You cannot walked to the other side of the Mausoleum, as you'll get a police whistle to the face there too. You must walk about 10-12 mins the long way around and two blocks behind the place to get in line. No signage. Basically, we just kept trying to get in until we could.

The queue moved at a steady pace and weaved in and out of the larger grounds. There are signs which say to drop your bag off at the locker point but we found out later that you don't have to drop it off at all. You need to hand over your camera and mobile phones at the second check-point. If you have a money belt, best to keep your phone on you turned off. Walking up to the Mausoleum, the crowd hushed and we entered the shrine in a very solemn atmosphere. It was a truly bizarre experience and I believe even the Vietnamese people in the crowd were also filled with awe and shock at the slightly macabre nature of the open 'coffin' itself. Definitely worth visiting as the feeling of seeing Ho Chi Minh's body over 30years deceased is indescribable."

I was able to catch the last entrance to the Mausoleum this morning (around 9:30am to 10:30am) and it's true that there is an awful long line. However, it was moving which is why the wait didn't feel as long to me.I was prepared to leave my backpack on the 1st checkpoint but was informed that I can take it with me provided that I surrender any water or food with the security. I had a bottle of water so I left it with them. They give you a stub and when I came back for it, it was returned to me.The 2nd checkpoint is where there is a machine similar to that used in airports where they scan your bag. I had two cellphones and camera inside but because it was kept and with no intention to use, again, I was cleared to bring my backpack.While walking in line, guards may have to remind you to take off your hat or shush you when you're closer to the entrance. I suggest keeping a solemn behavior and your hands to your sides. The viewing is a thousand times shorter than the walk and to get a better view, I would recommend that at the very gate, stay on your left side when the guards/ staff ask you to form two lines. When inside, don't take your eyes off the casket (enclosed in glass) but of course be mindful of your step so as not to bump into the one in front or in back of you.I'm glad I had the chance to visit this place. I don't need to see the other Museums anymore. This makes every bit of Hanoi worth it. :)P.S. There is no entrance fee."

We thought the best way would be across the grass directly in front of the mausoleum. A nice soldier with a very loud whistle made it most clear that though one could clearly see the mausoleum and it looked the quickest way in we were wrong and a good 10 minute walk around the perimeter was the only choice. Once you find the entrance - no mean feat - you can then join the queue. My tip would be to avoid this on a very hot day. All bags have to be checked in prior to joining the queue. Small cameras have to be placed in pockets. No photography is allowed. I think food and drink were were not allowed. So a long wait in the sun in the queue may not be an attractive option. We were lucky as the day we went there were not too many people there. Our guide said that queues ot two hours are not unusual. This being somewhat excessive for what amounts to a few minutes in the mausoleum.As you get closer to the mausoleum the queue quietens down and the atmosphere becomes more reverential. There are many soldiers on duty ensuring that all the rules are obeyed. Once inside the mausoleum the first thing you experience is the pleasant effect of airconditioning. Then it is slowly up some stairs and you are there - still in the queue - but slowly walking around the body of Ho Chi Minh laying is state with two soldoiers gurding him. Then its down some stairs and out.. And that is it....Not a unique experience as there is also Lenin and Mao - but a fairly unique experience and perhaps of all the sights you amy see in Vietnam perhaps the most powerful one. So if the weather is cool and the queue is short it is recommended."

You then walk under a covered walkway where there is some bathrooms before the 2nd check point which is a security check point. Here they put bags through a scanner and you walk through one as in an airport. Then cameras are taken at the next stop and put into a bag - you get a card and the camera is returned safely on the other side - there is no problem with this and is safe so don't be concerned. You the line up and walk into the mausoleum - you must be silent and you walk around the casket with ho chi Minh inside.

There was a blue canopy up to mark the route, which would have been greatly appreciated on a hot and sunny day. For me, on a not so sunny day, it simply highlighted the fact that everyone was being ushered along one path when actually there were many routes we could have taken to arrive at the entrance to the Mausoleum. Along the way, one of our party was told she had to leave her camera behind at the counter. None of the rest of us did though, we were told. We never did understand why. When we arrived at the entrance to the Mausoleum the queue moved quite quickly. It soon became apparent why. People in the line were 'shushed' when talking quietly and one of our group was even 'told off' by a soldier as he had his hand in his pocket! The queue moved through the hallway in a steady fashion, no one stopping or even slowing down on the way through. Then out the other side. This was a surreal experience and not one I particularly enjoyed, although I am no history buff so perhaps that is not too surprising. On the basis of the organisation of the whole place, we decided to give the Museum next door a miss."

I won't make comments about other related, nearby, sites that have their own Tripadvisor review pages, but will note here that the area has a number of sites, within easy walking distance of each other, that involve the legendary leader's life and legacy (such as where he lived, and his cars). I think this area and the mausoleum, in particular, represent the ideological and political heart of today's Vietnam and its reverential position clearly show in the beautiful grounds and state of upkeep. (I can't say spiritual heart as the nation is officially atheistic, as I understand it). So a visit to these sites should be recognized as significant, in terms of the history of the nation. It is worth spending some time reading a bit of its history to gain some background.The \"street\" in front of the mausoleum deserves notice. No traffic is seen, on what I estimated to be its width, equivalent to perhaps fifteen or more lanes. I do not know what its planners envisioned in its design, nor do I know how it is used. But on the day we were there, it appeared to me as a somewhat stark, silent, concrete reminder of human labor - and I should note that all the roads we were on during our stay, every few hundred feet or so, displayed red and yellow national flags often alternating with red and yellow hammer-and-sickle flags. The Soviet Union is gone, but its symbols, and the Soviet-designed mausoleum building conttaining Ho Chi Minh's embalmed body, present a sense of the country's Communist ideology. I don;t know if there is any place else in Vietnam that provides this experience.We were informed that the Soviets provided the technical assistance needed to preserve and maintain Ho Chi Minh's body, with their experience from embalming and maintaining Lenin's body, in Moscow.There were long lines but they moved efficiently, into the mausoleum, around corners, and finally into the darkened chamber the held the body on a raised platform,k lit by lights from above. No picture-taking was allowed. From the outside, we walked on red carpet into, through and out of the building, as I recollect."

Plus you have to find your way back to the different storage points when you come back out, a mission in itself.Check opening times and days so you don't trek all the way up there if you are staying like us in the Old Quarter to then find it closed!Read the do's and dont's of visiting and respect them for the sake of an important man and the Vietnamese people.Oh yeh you don't have to pay so don't know why some people have said they did, strange?"

Not sure if there was an entry fee or not (we went as part of a day tour that encompassed other sites). The guards do usher people through quickly and cameras are not permitted. The viewing room is quite dark but the famous leader can be clearly seen and appears to be well preserved having passed away in 1969! If you are in Hanoi you should visit this."

The grounds are just as imposing as the building itself, with wide streets (probably useful for passing military parades). That said, however, it was good to be able to see him in the flesh, so to speak, even if you can't get closer than a few metres to have a good look. There was a big line when we were there but it moved quickly. You don't get time to loiter when walking around the body. While no photos are allowed inside, you can take plenty of the outside on your way out. It is free entry but not open every day so check before you head off.

This was a good move, as by the time you walk to the building its all over in about 3 minutes if that.The first day we arrived the taxi driver dropped us right around the back on the far side of the grass overlooking the parade ground, we walked and walked and asked guards as we went how to get to the front, they just point. The second day another taxi driver tried to drop us to the side near that back, we told him no and to keep going, not sure what it is but the taxi driver didn't want to go near the front, probably traffic!Alot of donts.... don't walk on the grass near the parade ground, no hands in pockets, no hats and no speaking... we watched people being told to shush and hand signals to get hands out of pockets. Fair enough alot of this should be common sense anyhow!If your there at the right time you might see the army in action and their version of changing of the guards.

The Mausoleum itself is an interesting piece of architecture in its own right and stands adjacent to an imposingly large and obviously Soviet style Ho Chi Minh museum next door. The actual Mausoleum opening hours are only on specific days and close at 11AM, so make sure to ask your hotel. Most taxi drivers, hotel staff and tour operators all seemed to be well familiar with the days and times. Inside, you walk around his embalmed body which is in a glass display case up at eye level. You aren't allowed to stop or to take photos, but it was enough time to visually take in the site. His body looks as though he died only yesterday. It was eerily interesting and thought provoking. Outside, in front of the Mausoleum is a large park space but is also an excellent place to take photographs. There is a strict no-cross yellow line in front but it's close enough that you can still take a good shot. None of the guards we spoke to would allow us to take their photos or have our photos taken with them. I'm not sure if that was personal preference or policy, but it would have been fun had they allowed it. Still, it's worth making the trip even if only just to catch a photo of the exterior."

I spent 5 days in Hanoi, primarily in the Old Quarters and flipped through my Lonely Planet book numerous times until I decided to check this landmark out. I didn't bring any pants on this trip, only shorts so I was rather bummed by the idea of having to buy pants to get into the mausoleum. However, I don't think you actually need long pants (although they say to cover your knees). I saw a few folks wearing shorts with a button up shirt. My guess is that you just need to look respectable and leave the Bart Simpson look at home. The mausoleum itself is ridiculous. It's quite a spectacle to watch as the heavily guarded mausoleum is teaming with security guards and military personnel. This by itself was more amusing than Ho Chi Minhs' corpse. You only get to spend literally 1-2 minutes in his mausoleum. He looked alright, a bit skinny and his nails were starting to get a brackish color. The amount of manpower they use to upkeep the grounds and guard his dead body is just ridiculous. There was even a full platoon of sorts with assault rifles hanging out in one of the many gardens. The country outside is struggling to develop and pull itself out of poverty, but inside this mausoleum no expense seems to be spared. Seriously, it's worth the visit because of it's sheer ridiculousness.Quick pointers, you will get yelled or turned away if you don't follow these tips:- Check-in your bag if it's large, a typical day backpack is not allowed. Purses and man-purse (murses) are ok. Free check-in.- Don't put your hands in your pocket when you're in the mausoleum, it's considered disrespectful.- Don't chat while in the mausoleum or on the way in.- No food, including water, otherwise you'll need to check it in.- No electronics inside the mausoleum, but you can take pictures on the grounds outside.- Dress respectfully, pants below the knees and covered shoulders. Bring a scarf or something if you want to test waters."

You must arrive there early as it is only open for a couple of hours each day and you must have your shoulders and knees covered up or they wont let you in. The line can be rather long but since they shuffle you through like a cattle line it doesn't take long to get inside. The building is airconditioned to the extreme! You are ordered to walk 2 abreast and you cannot talk or wave your arms or gesture or slow down or you get told to move on. You walk in and round the body and out, that's it. However it is fascinating to see him 43 years after he died in such a good condition due to Russian Embalming technology!"

In China and North Korea, the Mausoleum line-ups were daunting.  Make sure you check the hours before you go. While we were there, it was only open for a couple of hours in the morning, on certain days of the week. And as I understand, it is closed entirely for a couple of months each year.

No cameras or cell phones (turned off in pocket) allowed since photography inside is forbidden. I gave our tour guide my camera and he took pics of us waiting in line but that was the extent of it until we got out of the mausoleum. I had read that the lines can get quite long but since August is the rainy, slow tourist season, and schools had started, not much of a wait. The line moves constantly as there is no stopping allowed. The guards got slightly annoyed with my wife who uses a cane when she slowed the line down behind us as she was climbing the stairs. The actual time in the mausoleum is no more than 1-2 mins max. You can take pictures of the outside of the mausoleum and the grounds are very well kept and spacious."

Coming from where we do, we think its weird to idolize some dead guy.'Anyway, the mausoleum is there, and it as well as Uncle Ho is a big deal in Vietnam, so we felt it natural to visit. It is a part of the history lesson this whole trip was meant to be for our kids. The day of our visit, an official North Korean delegation visited the mausoleum, so the side entrance normally open to foreigners (according to our guide) was closed, and we had to get in line. I had read it can take a long time to get in, but despite foreign dignitaries, I took us no more than 45 minutes to get in. It rained, but most of the pathway where we lined up was covered, so we passed time by looking at the overhead monitors, showing non-stop videos of various celebrations of the great leader. Sort of \"get you in the Uncle Ho mood\" while standing in line.The mausoleum is heavily guarded(?) by soldiers dressed in white parade uniforms. We were told they are trained for at least three years before they can serve at the mausoleum grounds. That is because they are not allowed to move as much as an eyebrow should they be unfortunate enough to have a bee land on their face.......Once inside the mausoleum, you are filed at slow pace in a big U around the glass coffin. There are ushers to ensure no one stops, and the coffin itself is surrounded by an honor guard.The dresscode was said to be very strict. I had brought extra pants for the occasion, as it says that men must be covered over the knees. That was not true. I wore shorts and no one said a word.After the mausoleum, we visited the grounds. They contain many interesting buildings. The most beautiful in my opinion is the Presidential Palace of Vietnam. Built from 1900 to house the French Governor-General of Indochina, it is a beautiful example of an Italian Renaissance building. Unfortunately it is closed to the public. There is also a garage with Ho Chi Minhs three cars on display; a Peugeot 404, a Pobeda and a Soviet made (Packard copy) 1954 ZIS.Further on is the simple apartment Ho Chi Minh lived in, and a stilt house he also lived in. The One Pillar Pagoda, or rather the reconstruction of the One Pillar Pagoda that was originally erected on 1049 sits on the grounds. The whole complex is absolutely well worth a visit, even if you skip the mausoleum."

Ho Chi Minh is such an important part of Vietnam- and to be able to see him and his actual preserved body is something else and incomparable to other Mausoleums because of this. The lines can be massive, but it moved really quickly. It is a tourist attraction but it was cool to see many local people going to pay their respect- more reason to go and more evidence of the important role Ho Chi Minh has taken in Vietnamese lives. Once inside, you probably get to see him for about 1 minute, but it's so cool. We were lucky enough to see a change of the National Guard as well at the same time. It's worthwhile and it was very easy to get to. It was very intriguing to experience."

The lines were rather fast and efficient and we were in and out of the Mausoleum quite quickly. In total, the average visitor only has about 20 to 30 seconds to look at the body, but that is enough time anyway because obviously cameras not allowed in such a place. If you have a camera you will need to turn it in before going in but you get back once you exit. It is pretty easy to see where to drop off and pick up your camera. There are other attractions nearby including the Temple of Literature. I recommend you start the day here and then walk out and explore the surrounding area."

You do literally file in and out of the Mausoleum quickly and look at a dead body, but it was an interesting expeirence. Make sure your shoulders and knees are covered, otherwise they make you buy cheap scarfs at the 'reception' area, but they weren't expensive, and no water allowed or cameras.

Before you go, make sure you have read even just a small paragraph about Ho Chi Minh. Hell I will tell you the little I know. Uncle Ho wanted to be cremated and have his ashes spread across Vietnam (kind of as a giant gesture of Vietnamese unity). After he died, they decided instead to embalm him and place him in possibly the coldest ugliest building you will ever come across. It is rumored the (wannabe Lincoln mimic) building is representative of a lotus flower. We had fun trying to imagine how! Why I recommend the trip is because once you have been marched into the mausoleum, silently walked around the body and marched right back out you will feel genuinely disturbed. More than ever you will appreciate your free will and rights! Go do it!"

Be mindful, the military citadel is off limits and you can only enter the line to go to the mausoleum in two places. So do not trust google maps because the streets they tell you to walk down are restricted. The mausoleum is only open from 8am-11am, I'd recommend going on the earlier side to avoid the heat and long lines.You enter from only 2 entrance points. There are signs with arrows all around the area telling you where to go. All backpacks are scanned and you walk through a metal detector. You are not allowed to bring water with you. After security, you follow the line of people to the entrance. Military guards with bright white uniforms are around directing people, impossible to get lost. The line to the entrance is covered blocking you from the sun, very nice!Walking the steps to the mausoleum, passing the guards in white you are greeted with very cold air conditioning. It's much appreciated in hot Hanoi! Following the line, you walk on a red carpet, through 3 short undecorated halls to meet Vietnam's most famous celebrity. The room with Ho Chi Minh is quite small with 8 guards, photos are obviously prohibited. WALK SLOW! It's not a big room and you can't stop, so walk as slow as the guards will let you to get a good glimpse. You only spend about 30 seconds in the room with Uncle Ho. From there you follow the line to the hot outside and you can go where you like. We went back to the front to take pictures in front of the mausoleum, pictures are allowed of the outside.This is a great attraction because it's free and short. From standing in the security line to leaving after taking pictures in front of the mausoleum, it's about a 15 minute attraction. Plus have you ever seen anyone embalmed before? It's a very interesting experience."

We were perfectly respectable in our dress and demeanour but felt intimdated and were happy to leave. It reminds you that as a tourist destination, the people seem split between those who welcome us getting to understand their culture and those who'd rather see the back of us. Then again, I'm grateful for a taste of a real place and people. Even so, I could have done without it.

The guide books explains what you should wear and how to behave at the mausoleum but even when you think you have done everything in preparation it can still be a hassle. So I hope this review will help eliminate some of that hassle. First don't go on the weekend. There are thousands of local Vietnamese turning up to pay their respects and the queues are enormous. Stick to a week day and go early. Do not have bare shoulders but you can wear shorts as long as they cover the knee. You will not be allowed to carry any food or drink into the mausoleum and will have to leave your rucksack/bag at the entrance building. Carry a smaller bag for glasses, wallets etc which you can transfer these belongings into. About half way along the queue you will have to deposit your cameras. These go into a security bag and you pick them up as you leave the mausoleum. They are very efficient and the system does work so don't worry. The actual experience inside the mausoleum is interesting because of the great reverence Vietnamese people still pay to \"The Father of Vietnam\". The experience inside lasts a matter of minutes as you are ushered around and quickly moved on by security guards if you pause. Once outside you can buy a ticket to visit the other buildings associated with Ho Chi Minh. The museum is definitely worth visiting. But remember the complex closes for lunch so collect your bag before they close otherwise you are stuck until they reopen in the afternoon or following morning."

Given the reverence that is bestowed upon Ho Chi Minh it is surprising really that foreigners are allowed in to see him at all. For that reason then, I advise you to maintain a certain solemnity, unlike some French people who were just in front of my daughter and I in the line. It's not that hard really to move silently as requested and to observe a couple of minutes respect for another person I think. There is no time for loitering to have a look at Ho Chi Minh but the first thing you notice is his definite orange glow! The second thing is the dumb-struck awe on the faces of the Vietnamese - this really means something to them. Once outside, the Presidential Palace grounds are adjacent to the mausoluem. You ca also stand at the front of the mausoleum and take photos - but don't step on the grass!"

Never mind that he wished to be cremated, or that preservation of somebody like this is more of an imitation of what the Russians (who paid for Ho Chi Minh\u2019s preservation) did with Lenin, he lies in the mausoleum for all to see. We waited in line for 30-60 minutes, a relatively short time compared to normal waits here. We are carefully herded two-by-two through a series of right angle turns until we are in front of the mausoleum. In the course of waiting, we have had to shed all cameras, and been checked to ensure we meet the dress code-no short shorts, bare shoulders, sunglasses, or hats. This place deserves all the respect and more of the most sacred temples in this country.  Outside and inside the mausoleum are guards wearing white uniforms trimmed in the gold and red of the Vietnamese flag (gold and red historically symbolize prosperity and happiness in Buddhist tradition, but the red today also symbolizes the blood that spilled by many generations for Vietnamese independence; the five-pointed gold star in the middle of the flag symbolizes five classes (military, professional, administrative, farming, and working) working together for the prosperity of the country). I am assuming this assignment is quite like that of Arlington Cemetery for U.S. Marines, but I was also taken here by how unkempt the uniforms looked and undisciplined the guards outside seemed. None of the look-straight-ahead-stand-straight-as-a-board-never-twitch discipline that I associate with our Marines at Arlington. Inside the mausoleum, I counted 18 guards, including four who stand at attention with rifles at each of the four corners of the glass enclosed tomb where Ho Chi Minh\u2019s body lies. Guards along the line seemed to be devoted primarily to grabbing slow movers, like me more than once, by the elbow to move us along. After an hour wait, one views Ho Chi Minh for less than a minute, and then moves on to the the French-built building where he lived from 1954-58 (not the \u201cpalace\u201d the French had built, but the former servant\u2019s quarters), and then to the Vietnamese house built on stilts in the style of the homes of the mountain people where he lived the remainder of his life. It is a simple, pretty, heavily guarded place on pond where tourists clap to attract the carp to the surface where they feed them until they are shooed along by the guards in white. The preserved corpse is a little creepy. The homes are simple, but provide real insight into the man. The real reason to go her, though, is to see the thousands and thousands of people who flock here from all parts of the country to honor Ho Chi Minh. This complex attracts thousands upon thousands, young and old, families and couples, Vietnamese and foreigners--much like Washington DC, when school is out."

However, that aside, it's worth the visit, you don't often get the chance to see an embalmed, long dead, great leader."

They take all of your cameras and phones off you and you handbag if it is a large one. also backpacks etc. You then have to walk in two lines into the mausoleum. No talking, laughing etc. a very sombre place. You then walk up some steps(in 2 lines) then walk briskly past Uncle Ho, who is looking remarkably good for one who has bee dead for so long. Apparently he goes to Russia between September and November for a touch up each year. When walking past the guards also ensure you walk with your hands by your side. a word of advise- very cold in there so make sure you have a light jumper or cardigan. also, you must ensure you have shoulders and knees covered to be allowed in. so no tank tops and shorts but T. shirt is O.K and longer skirt, shorts or jeans. After filing past the coffin, you get to see where he spent the last few years of his life and view the outside of the presidential palace."

My husband and I got there about 10:00am. I would advise getting there much earlier. There were a lot of people being dropped off in coaches. We queued for about 45mins. You must dress sensibly to enter - no low tops or short skirts. (We witnessed two woman being turned away because of the way they were dressed!). Large bags and backpacks were not allowed inside the mausoleum and cost us about 10,000VND to check in at the office. No water or cameras were allowed. We first had to go through airport type security - bags had to be put through a scanner and each person had to walk through a metal detector. As we got closer to the building itself it was all quite formal, like a military operation! We had to walk single file, in silence and all hands out of pockets. There were many guards with rifles by the entrance and inside. They were checking everyone in the queue and making sure we kept quiet. We had to walk through the building at a slow pace without stopping. It was very cold inside and you get a very odd feeling seeing Ho Chi Minh's actual body laying there in a glass coffin. There were 4 men in each corner of the coffin guarding his body. Complete silence! You were only in the room with the body for about 20 seconds but overall it was definitely worth the long wait and I would recommend it to everyone visiting Hanoi. The whole thing was an interesting experience!"

When visiting: wear clothes as ordered, follow the lines, do not stray onto the grass, keep your hands at your side, take off your hat, take off your sunglasses, check your camera, pick up your camera hopefully where you left it, no laughing, no talking, keep up with those ahead of you, 10 seconds of looking, get going."

OK it is obvious that 'Uncle Ho' is the perpetual figurehead of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam but I'm not sure if this is what he wanted. The queue, even early in the day, was long and tedious. The guards are extremely officious and controlling re what they regard as disrespectful behaviors and when you get inside the mausoleum the viewing of Ho Chi Minh is relatively short and also a bit difficult due to the lighting being just a little low. Yes this is a significant place for Vietnamese but can't help thinking it is a bit overdone. Worth going through to see the gardens and buildings of the Presidential palace."

The mausoleum itself is a stone block no big architectural moment here, a mixture of soviet realism and greek temple in style. Inside there is Ho Chi Minh lying in a sacophag and you can see him pretty good. Unless you are a fan of him, nothing very impressive, in the end it is just a dead man. What is fascinating is the cult around it. Not only tourists are driven there by the busload, also huge amounts of vietnamese people come her, a lot organized and the minorities in their local custom. (they get priority access) The queue does moove pretty fast, you have to check all your belongings (cameras, bags and so on). Outside and inside soldiers will guard the place and they make sure you have even your hands in the correct way. All in all a good way to feel the dedication and admiration directed toward Ho Chi Minh."

If you don't see this you may just miss a fundamental part of the country that is not too evident elsewhere, but pervades things in a way we maybe don't get to see. Note the coachloads of orderly children from all over the country in disciplined crocodiles, but also perhaps notice the teenagers nearby with their smart phones and skinny jeans etc and wonder where it will all be in 10 years time."

Despite the fact that you are basically staring at a dead body and despite the fact that embalming was strictly against Ho's wishes (he hated the personality cult so would probably be turning in his grave if theyd' buried him instead of embalming him!) the need to say you have visited the mausoleum is overwhelming. But remember to get there between 8am and 11 am because it closes after that. The queues can be long but they move quickly. You won't be allowed in unless you are dressed respectfully (no shorts, no exposed shoulders) and you have to leave cameras and mobile phones in a secure area. I am told that every autumn he is flown to Russia for maintenance so you may need to check that he is actually there when you visit. Finally, it is ironic that as you exit the mausoleum and make your way to the rest of the complex you are confronted by stall after stall selling Pepsi Cola - if only the Americans had waited 30 years they could have avoided a lot of trouble!"

They will however challenge anyone wearing sunglasses or otherwise acting irreverently. You will then follow the slow moving queue past Ho Chi Minh's enbalmed body which even after 43 years shows no sign of deterioration.

The Mausoleum is also close to the Ho Chi Minh Museum and the 1 piller pagoda. So like I said, it is a nice walk over there and you have plenty to see in one spot."

Ho Chi Minh's resting place, an impressive mausoleum in Hanoi, is well worth a visit, but be warned - get there early as thousands of Vietnamese families begin lining up from about 7am. You'll be required to leave your camera for safe keeping as you join the queue (no photography is allowed in the mausoleum) but it will be waiting for you several hundred metres away when you leave the mausoleum. It's a very efficient service .Depending what time you arrive, it can be a long, slow walk in the queue to reach the mausoleum. Make sure you time your visit with the changing of guard which is a spectacle in itself. Make sure you watch the older members of the families explaining to the children what they're seeing. Their reverence is amazing and it's common to see people crying as they walk around the glass tomb.Nearby is a museum on Vietnam's history and Uncle Ho's house, which features outstanding use of timber. The gardens near the mausoleum are a great respite from the heat. On the way back to Hanoi stop and look at the infamous Hanoi Hilton in the old gaol and get more information on the country's history."

It was so regimented and very little freedom of movement was allowed. No stepping out of line, walking single, then double file, every movement was controlled. Lots of soldiers everywhere all looking resplendent in sparkling white uniforms; but put a foot wrong and who knows how they'll react. Even outside on the street, everyone could only take pictures from way back and far away.HCM was a very tiny man!"

Visiting the interior actually took about 1 minute - four guards around the sarcophagus and a constant stream of people going through. Then when you get out you can go to see Ho Chi Minh's house (quite interesting - 10,000 dong) and the Museum. We took a taxi to the mausoleum and it cost about 25,000 dong from the centre."

Once you enter the mausoleum, you cannot talk, you have to have your arms hanging to the sides (don't put them in your pockets, or a guard will walk up to you to correct you). At last you arrive in the main chamber and have about 30 seconds to look at the body. I looked, and looked again, then looked some more. Perhaps it's my inexperience with embalmed bodies, but I swear it looked like one of Madame Tussaud\u2019s wax figurines. The other people on my tour agreed. It just looked so fake and waxy with a yellowish tint. The hair on the sides of his head looked like it was etched into his scalp rather than protrude like normal hair does. I came away unsatisfied."

Newer reviews suggest that it is now in fact, open. Regardless the grounds were beautiful and the building was quite decent for some photo's. The numerous soldiers around the grounds were well presented but DON'T step over that white line or they will yell at you! (fair enough too).

We were sweating in shorts and thin tops; we wondered how they survived standing in the full sun in Hanoi's humidity for any length of time.Usually there are long queues of Vietnamese and tourists waiting to pay their respects to Ho Chi minh, but for our visit the Mausoleum was closed to visitors for renovations; apparently to the body of Ho Chi Minh, not the building.We did wonder what such a seemingly humble man would think of this memorial built in his honour and to house his body. It was Ho's wish that he be interred in three separate areas of north, central, and southern Vietnam upon his death. Instead the beauracracy chose to erect this monument."

Bring your camera (before you go into the mausoleum you have to hand in the camera as taking photos inside the mausoleum is forbidden) --> behind the mausoleum you will get your camera back as you might need it for the complex and the other buildings (I didnt know that and couldnt take any pics...my bad!)3. Dont wear sunglasses, hats, ultra short shorts or sleeveless shirts --> they might ask you to cover your \"exposed body parts\" :-)4. Its free...so go there and enjoy (as much as you can enjoy looking at dead people...)"

I come from the school of thought that sees it all as a bit ghoulish, but fortunately I was there in December when the body was away from re-embalming, so I got away with only viewing the waxwork replica.The Vietnamese are very formal about it, as you would expect for the last resting place of a dead national hero. Photography is strictly forbidden, although I did see a few people taking discrete shots with camera phones (although not inside the mausoleum itself - that would take a brave or stupid person). Goose stepping guards lend an air of surreal formality to the procession. And every so often they snap at someone who has not shown the proper respect (for example, by not removing a hat). I wouldn't want to overstate it, but it did provide something of a window into the way that the ruling party sees itself and its country.Overall, I think it is worth stopping in, not least because the setting is very picturesque and you can enjoy the calm and quiet. You can then go on to see the One Pillar Pagoda by the exit, and (if you like) pay to enter the Ho Chi Minh museum."

Even waiting in line is an experience as there are military soldiers dressed to the nines in their fabulous white suits all along the pathsways. The square in front of the mausoleum is huge and must be packed on special days. The entry is as grand as the building and full of reverence and awe. As you shuffle quickly up some stairs and into the main area where Ho Chi Minh lies instate, you can't help but be touched by the way he looks.....just asleep, but what a fine looking man. It is cool, dark and surreal and must be your first stop in Hanoi to understand the country and the reverence which Ho Chi Minh commands even in death. After you are shuffled out, race back to get your cameras and bags etc and take a couple of hours to wander at will, around the beautiful gardens and grounds and take in the cars, stilt house, ponds, drink stands and all the little shops to buy some goodies to take home at reasonable prices."

            "review": "Seeing the body lying permanently in state is a curiosity. I saw a long queue of mainly Japanese travelers waiting to go inside the granite mausoleum in Ba Dinh Square to see the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh.Yes, there he lies on a four-poster bed with a guard at each post. His body down in a cut-out section of floor so that visitors can walk around and look down on his uniformed body. His mausoleum is fashioned after Lenin's in Moscow. Once a year, he is shipped off to Russia for renovation... and new makeup, I would presume. Then he is back in place for visitors. He was there in all his regalia while I visited so, naturally I had to see this site for myself.After seeing the body, I then had to see where Ho lived in a modest home and then the lovely place built for him. Always on a pond stocked with fish since he loved fishing. Seeing his revered body only intrigued me to learn more about this man so I researched more when I got home. Fascinating figure. This was really different that seeing mummies or relics of popes in other countries. Definitely one side of Hanoi that is worth a visit. Standing in that long queue is something I would not have done without the help of our guide, Han, who got the six of us past the line and inside easily. If you have that priviledge, go in the mausoleum. Traveling time is so precious, standing in long lines does take up too much time when I could be seeing other sites of interest. I was lucky.If there was a fee, I didn't know, as I was part of a very tiny group and it was included. I can't answer the question below about this attraction."

During our stay in Hanoi we decided to visit the Mausoleum, a place where Vietnamese travel to pay homage to Ho CHi Minh himself. My suggestion is that if they don't want tourists then don't open it up to them!It was complete disarray! After taking half an hour to find the entrance, we couldn't find any signs where to pay to enter etc. We circled a few times only to got back to the start where we found a security booth which had been unmanned previously. We walked in to ask what to do and were told to get our bags scanned. We were then told we were idiots for not putting our water bottles in the bin...sorry didnt see the sign on this??!! We were then shoved out the door and pointed left. We wandered along until we found a covered walkway and followed along until a place where we deposited our camera. Sure I was never seeing that again I actually did get it back. We then sauntered along (Vietnamese dont do anything fast lol!) until we filed through the mausoleum for 20 seconds of looking at HCM and then bam ya out, collect camera and then pay to go look at his house etc. I have a great appreciation of other country's history and culture but this was not worth the hassle!"

I was expecting the Mausoleum to be fairly ordinary, something to tick off the list but I was blown away by how much respect the people have for this man, and rightly so I guess - he was certainly a modest leader for the people. To see Ho Chi Minh embalmed, perfectly preserved was, I can't describe it, the place just had this unusual vibe to it. The strict guards, the silence, the line shuffling through - I'm glad I experienced it and would actually go back again if I ever return to Hanoi."

He did get a numbered tag so he could get it again after seeing Ho Chi Minh. Meanwhile I asked the guide what I had to do to be able to get in so she told me to buy a shawl from the shop and wrap it around my waist. This cost about $6. My husband returned and asked me where I had gotten the shawl from I told him I had bought it. He started to laugh and told me that they had them for free up in the collection area and you just returned them on leaving. Ripped Off!

The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum was built on the spot where Ho Chi Minh (not his real name but one of his many aliases), declared Vietnamese independence. The Vietnamese people love Ho Chi Minh but not enough to honour his wishes that he be cremated and his ashes scattered over the countryside of Vietnam. Viewing Ho Chi Minh is a rigidly controlled experience. Guards line people up two by two and people are not allowed to stop walking when viewing Ho Chi Minh. One man walked in clasping his hands in front of him and he was immediately told to put his hands by his side. People musn't touch each other while walking through the mausoleum. No talking of course, not even whispering. Nothing can be carried into the mausoleum. The line of people walk into the mausoleum, along one wall and then across the front of the Mausoleum. Turning their head to the left they can then see the emblamed Ho. There is a light that illuminates Ho. Behind Ho, the wall looks to be dark brown marble. On one half of the wall is a big yellow star and on the other half of the wall is a hammer and sickle, all done in marble. It looks very dignified. Be careful of opening hours - sometimes they are restricted. Also be aware that Vietnam sends Ho Chi Minh to Russia somewhere around September - November each year for re-embalming. So he isn't there during those months. It is worth visiting the mausoleum just to experience the rigid conditions of entry as the viewing of Ho is extremely short."

Our guide took there anyway...what an eye opening experience. We felt the Communism in the air from the moment we were in line. They take your bags, phones, cameras (our guide took ours so we didn't have to give them to the guards). You walk in silence in this long line of people. Inside it is dark and so cold and silent... no talking allowed, and the guards take that serious! There seem to be guards everywhere. It is kind of creepy to go in and see Uncle Ho laying there, but is very interesting to see the guards, the VIetnamese people, and their reverence for this man. I would highly recommend going to there just because I have never seen or felt anything like that before in my life! Afterwards, our guide met up with us again and talked to us about Uncle Ho and the history. Very interesting to get a Vietnamese point of view!"

None of the reviews i read so far (either on this or other sites) mentioned the opening hours so i thought it would be good to point this out.I was told by the hotel this place opens only on Friday - Sundays, from 7.30am to 10.30am. However, my tour guide told me it closes at 12 noon. Because of the last-min. notification of its short opening hours, I had to give the Mausoleum a skip as I could not reschedule it in my plans. Just a point to note if you are planning to visit. It was a 'so-near-yet-so-far' situation for me! :("

The other reviews/guides give you the gist -- you line up in 2 lines, usually with about 2000 schoolkids and other curious tourists. You walk steady from the back of the line through the room where they have Ho. No pictures or they might shoot you. You get about 10 seconds in the room with Ho. Quite an experience. Really is neat to see the reactions of the native Vietnamese, especially all of the young kids (I believe that class trips are very common)."

They line you up two at a time and in total silence you are allowed to walk by and view him lying in state. While it may seem goolish, it is a fascinating experience and take a moment to look at the faces of the Vietnamese that are in line with you."
