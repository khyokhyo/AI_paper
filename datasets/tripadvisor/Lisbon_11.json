While it's easy to get a tuktuk or taxi to get there, it's much harder to get one to leave as it's quite far out of the old own. We ended up walking back."

They had a link that you can access a guide through your smartphone , but I was too busy taking pics, so I wish I had another alternative. When you think of \"tile museum\" it simplifies the beautiful art form inside a perfect Lisbon location .... A convent! It is much more than what you think a tile museum would be like.... And to me, the best is culminating in an actual chapel/church combining tiles and the typical Manueline style of the country.... Odd and interesting were the choir chairs - behind them , on each back rest ,were some interesting, some gruesome reliquaries that you might miss because you are in awe of what lies ahead . It's truly a special , unique, tastefully presented museum and delivering more than what you expect ..."

I found the religious ones less interesting but, obviously an important part of the culture. The small chapel is impressive. One can follow the Moorish influences and I personally found those tiles more impressive. There is a beautiful garden and a nice cafe, also decorated with tiles. If it happens your trip coincides with the first Sunday of the month, the entrance is free."

It's one of the oldest European countries with so much history and so much that the rest of the world owes to their people, their nevigators and what they discovered. They brought everyone together by their discoveries."

When she heard that we were off to Lisbon a neighbour told us 'don't miss the tile museum' did not describe it, just said we would see when we got there! It is a lovely peaceful building, with a shady courtyard where we had a coffee and after securing a very good map rooms full of tiles tracing the history from earliest Moorish patterns to modern ceramics. Formerly a convent as the suggested route is followed through severe stone corridors and cloisters suddenly you come into a huge gilded and decorated chapel which has to be seen to be believed. More corridors and tiles, and another lovely chapel on the floor above. We stayed for a very tasty and inexpensive lunch, in a refectory decorated with blue and white tiles depicting meat, poultry and veg from long ago. A lovely cool and interesting place to be on a hot day in Lisbon"

I also enjoyed the modern examples of ceramic pottery. Other highlights are the church and the cloisters. One small quibble would be that when we paid we were not offered a floor plan so had to go back. It felt slightly unwelcoming in view of the fact it is a bit out of the way and we had got a local bus. Surely they want visitors? We had tea in the caf\u00e9 courtyard which was lovely."

            "review": "Extraordinary collection, staff inadequate. The collection of the National Tile Museum is an artistic wonder - full of amazing examples of the beautiful colored tiles that have been produced in Portugal for centuries. The presentation is comprehensive, starting with early examples from the Middle Ages and continuing on to the present times. It is also possible to watch an interesting film about the history of tile making, although its format is insufficiently complete and systematic and concentrates too much on the self-indulgence of the filmmakers (a tremendous waste of time that could be used for a more meaningful experience). The building in which the collection is housed is a masterpiece of Manueline architecture that is worth visiting for its own sake. The behavior of the staff that I experienced there recently unfortunately makes it impossible for me to give a higher rating than average. They are not helpful and not friendly, even when asked questions in Portuguese. They are indifferent at best and frequently rude, for example when I tried to order something at their restaurant and only received disgraceful rudeness in response to a polite request in Portuguese for an item clearly posted on their menu. I couldn't recommend avoiding the collection just because the staff is so poorly trained. The beauty of the tiles is easily capable of making the spectator forget their inadequate sense of professional obligations."

Yes, it\u2019s out of the way in a rather industrial area but all of that is forgotten when you walk through the door of the former palace. The collection of art is fascinating and walks you through time as Portuguese tile art evolved through time.

This museum is in itself beautiful as it is located in a \"repurposed\" convent which incorporated a great deal of the art of Portuguese tile (azulejos=tiles) in its construction. The museum explains the evolution of the tile from an Arab art passing to Holland and landing in Portugal. The Portuguese used the azulejo to decorate or cover entire walls of a building's interior so they had to speed up the azulejo manufacturing process.As you go through the museum which offers the opulence of the former convent as a subtext, you see its evolution and even modernist renderings in ceramic. Once you leave the museum, you start to see its \"lessons\" popping up as you walk through the street of Lisbon and into its buildings, churches, cafes, restaurants, etc.I would say that you could spend a very pleasant and informative two hours here. The cafeteria attached is also quite lovely \"sort of\" open air with awning to block any direct sun and a gurgling fountain."

Three floors of exquisite \"azulejos\" (tiles) from the 8th Century to the 20th Century). Three floors divided by time \u00e9poque. The colors and intricacies were unbelievable; largely religious motifs. Attached to the museum is a church and chapel, again featuring intricate tiles and others pieces of religious artifacts.

If this is your thing, take a trip out to the museum."

When we left, we waited for about a hour to catch a bus back to the centre but the scheduled one did not turn up so this is not the easiest of places to find.There is a fee to enter the museum and there is a good caf\u00e9/restaurant near the entrance. There are also toilets near the entrance.There is an extensive collection of historic Lisbon tiles, including religious, period and geometric themes. there are also some unusual scenes, such as the chicken's wedding, where the chicken is being driven to the church by monkeys! There is also a full-scale chapel in the museum. Towards the exit, there are modern exhibits and an impressive tile display of the Lisbon cityscape. Do not attempt to stray off the suggested route (which is not always marked out) or the security guard may get grumpy!Allow around one and a half to two hours for a visit."

It's a time consuming business - each one individually numbered and cleaned with small brushes and dentistry type tools!The cafe is reasonably priced and the food tasty.

When you step into the museum, the collections covers from as early as 15th century to today in various styles. Since it is located in a former convent, so a chapel decorated with gold & tile painting will surprise you. The highlight of the museum is the longest tile, 23m with 1300 tiles, made in 1738, which shows the city scenery of Lisbon before earth quake in 1775."

After spending a few days touring Lisbon and visiting historic sites, it is fascinating to then look at the panorama and compare it to what you've seen.

The National Tile Museum itself is quite a sight too, even if tiles are not really your thing either: its situated in an old monastery, offering a peaceful atmosphere even in high season.

I enjoyed the timeline of how the tiles evolved over the centuries. There are cards with information on each tile and the museum has an app you can download in English with more information. Because tiles are part of Portugal's history, I think this museum is worth your time. It's only 5 Euro. Plus, you can enjoy the convent and cloister, too."

It's a bit slippery but they have someone guarding it, asking you not to stand on it for your own safety.I'd advise that anyone who visits, should spend some time in the cafe. The cakes and coffees were wonderful. Really tasty large portions. The outdoor area was so relaxing with plenty of seating amongst the water features with turtles/terrapins. The gift shop is excellent too with something available for everyone - no matter how hard to buy for. Not your usual gift shop tat but really classy looking gifts at affordable prices.

There was a very interesting section on how tile was made, though it is a part of the museum ripe for a video rather than just a series of displays, some (but not all) of which are in English. The museum traces the history of tiles. It is amazing to see tiles that are more than 500 years old that are still so brightly colored. There is a church (annexed into the museum? Recreated?) that is odd because you notice all the gold so much more than the tiles. There are two very interesting sections of contemporary tiles.The gift shop was a HUGE disappointment. They sell almost no actual tiles. We had seen tiles and items made with tiles (picture frames, mirrors, jewelry) elsewhere, but held off thinking we'd purchase at the museum. However, the selection there was limited to non-existent. If you see something you like elsewhere, buy it. Seems this could be much better both for visitors and as a revenue generator for the museum. Very disappointing.Altogether, worth a trip, but I was glad we went in Sunday and got in free."

The first part of the display concentrates on the making of tiles, which is surprisingly simple once you know how!

            "review": "An unusual art and tradition. Portugal is practically synonymous with azulejos, or decorative tiles. They are most visible on building exteriors across the country, but are also found lining a variety of interior surfaces, including ceilings, walls, mantles, and even altars (at one point in Portuguese history, churches were the largest commissioner of tiles). While Italy decorated with frescoes, Portugal decorated with tiles! The azulejo is so important to the history of Portugal, there is even a museum dedicated to this art.The Museo Nacional do Azulejo is housed in a former convent, so it is architecturally beautiful, even beyond the colorful tile aspect. It has a traditional cloister and courtyard, and a stunning gilded Baroque church dedicated to Madre de Deus or Mother of God. As a museum, it houses a diverse tile collection, ranging from 15th century tiles to modern tile art. Beyond showcasing the country\u2019s tile heritage, the museum also serves a social responsibility of tile preservation and restoration. If you enter the cloister\u2019s quadrangle, you can see the preservationists at work, sorting and repairing an incomprehensible number of tiles.The museum depicts the various techniques used to make tiles and how these methods evolved over time. Like the technology, the designs themselves changed depending on trends -- from simple Moorish-inspired geometric designs to Renaissance biblical scenes to blue-and-white Dutch Delft patterns to Rococco nature scenes.The museum was the very first thing I did in Lisbon, which proved to be a wise choice over the next five days; it provided me with a much greater appreciation and understanding of the tiles I would encounter practically everywhere!The museum is slightly isolated on the Lisbon outskirts, especially if you are averse to public transit. I took bus 742, which stopped just a few blocks from our hotel (the Sheraton) and dropped me off right in front of the museum. Bus 742 also has several metro connections, including Saldanha and Arroios stations. I enjoyed the ride, as we passed through local neighborhoods I never would have seen otherwise.Entrance is \u20ac5, but there are many combination tickets I realized in hindsight would have been financially smart. You can see the various combinations on the museum\u2019s website and pick one that makes sense for you. The museum is also included in the Lisbon Card, which provides access to multiple attractions as well as transit.I wrote about the museum and the tiles around Lisbon on my blog (link in profile) if you want to see a lot more of my photos."

This museum collects and guards a precious collection of tiles first created in the 15th century, that a times takes your breath away with the scale and beauty. Examples range from the 16th century up to the present day. The museum is located in a tranquil location housed in a former 16th century convent with beautiful cloisters and a sacristy panelled in Brazilian wood. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit on a very wet day and spent all morning looking at the displays of tools, the craftsmanship and collection of paintings.The museum has a good caf\u00e9 on site where at the end of our visit we enjoyed lovely Cream of Leek Soup with crusty bread and good coffee, This visit is a must see if you find yourself in Lisbon"

Exhibits for the most part have English as well as Portuguese labels, and they are arranged chronologically so that there is a sense of the development of the art form in Portugal. As many have noted, there is a sadly untended garden in the cloister center, and while budgeting is undoubtedly tight it wouldn't take that much to weed and water the garden. If the doors are open, walk out into it anyway and look in through the windows at the masses of as-yet uncurated tiles -- it gives a sense of the ongoing work of the museum. The cafe on the main floor has unremarkable food and service but at least has a nice garden to sit in.While interesting, the museum could be so much better. Discussion of tile-making technique and changes, more indication (photos would be nice) of how the works would have looked in place, something to add some visual drama to what (to the uneducated eye) seems like an endless array of largely blue and white tiles."

After the third room we visited, I felt it was going to be a bit pedestrian however walking into the chapel, which we didn't even realise was there, just knocked our socks off. Incredible age, beautiful stories depicted in the tile work and set in a majestically decorated religious space. The top floor had some contemporary tile art, not my cup of tea, but lots of young people taking it in.My only downside to this place is that the internal cloister garden, central to the beauty and age of the place us run down and unkempt. This channels really, the current story of Portugal I think, in that the government is pretty broke.Highly recommended visit."

However, it is definitely worth a visit. it starts out with a history of ceramic tile in Portugal from the 13th or 14th century up to the contemporary era. The early material is relatively simple in individual design but wonderfully rich and complex when brought together into patterns. Over time it takes on religious themes and then becomes more secular (the Marriage of the Chicken!). The highlight of the entire museum is on the top floor (it takes a bit of exploring to find it) where there is a 20+ M long panorama of the entire city of Lisbon in the early 18th century, just years before the city was razed by an earthquake in 1755.

The museum has a comprehensive part dedicated to the history of tiles in Portugal, which traces the different production techniques and explains how they allow for different styles. There's also a part concerning the role of tiles in society, as socio-economic markers, religious use and much more. Lastly there's an exhibit of modern tiles, and a changing temporary exhibit. In addition the museum grounds is in a old cloister, and you can see some fantastic chapels and renovated pars of the cloister. The whole thing is narrated via an audioguide which you download as an app. The museum has wifi. This audioguide is very good, and even has text and pictures if you want to delve even further into the history of tiles. Remember to bring your smart phone and a headset! In addition to all of this, I found the staff to be the most helpful and courteous of the ones I met in all of Portugal. They have also focused on accessibility for the blind (with tactile displays and the audio) and wheelchair users. This place is a gem!"

Tiles are such a big and unique part of the Portuguese decorative language that it would be remiss to not see the national collection if you are at all even vaguely interested. Tiles are covered from early period work though to current artists. The displays are weak in the latter period 1900 till current day ( partly addressed by temporary exhibition) but the display from this era would be worth the trip alone. The chapel from it's previous life is special and seems to be remarkable well preserved. The museum is some distance from metro or tram a bus stop is out the front but for 6 euro a taxi will take you there from the old town centre and is well worth the fair.The shop at this location was very good with artisan signed pieces on sale for extremely reasonable pricing.I did not eat at the well reviewed cafe but it did have a nice ambience about it.Over all a remarkably good experience without the crowds at other museums around the city."

I had seen the staff exchanging glances at some other tourists who were being a bit more demanding of good service. Really a bad experience here. The tile museum was just great. Really interesting although the English translation tailed off on some of the more interesting exhibits.

A highlight for me was to see the panoramic view of Lisbon pre 1755 earthquake. There are probably few surviving visual records of the city from that time.

The museum is set in a former convent and there are wonderful cloisters and the most lavish chapel all full of tiles as well as plenty of other examples, my personal favourites being those that showed hunting scenes. But there is so little information about them. I became frustrated after 5 minutes that I was not learning anything about the tiles on show so went back to the shop and spent a massive 32 Euros on the guidebook. I am glad I did - it meant I could read more information about most of the tiles on show, spot things I would never have seen otherwise and I also have a wonderful memory of the visit. But some of this information should be on the labels...Oh, and the staff need some lessons in customer service. Really unfriendly lady on the desk and the guy in the shop did not want to provide me with a receipt for my catalogue purchase though one of his colleagues came to the rescue.Thanks to whoever suggested getting a taxi to the museum.

Quite a lot, as this museum showsThe reason this is worth a visit is that tiles are a National Passion in Portugal. One way to know you have crossed from Portugal to Spain is to look at an urban scene. If many of the building are covered in tile, you are still in Portugal; if not you are in Spain.Our experience was vastly enhanced by our Viking guide who was an art history major . I fnot on a Viking tour it is probably worth hiring a docent there is a lot to the story of Portuguese tile.There is a Portuguese tile style and it is worth learning as it will inform what you see as you go about in Portugal.Be sure to go the top level t see the tile mural done just before the 1755 earthquake showing Lisbon literally before the crash.Another reason to see this near the start of your trip is that museum has an option to paint/glaze a tile of your own using traditional methids and glazes."

There are tiles from the 15th century along with a whole wall of tiles that were completed before the earthquake in 1738 showing the Lisbon city scape. The colors and detail vary based on who was in power and what was going on over the years. Plan to spend at least 2-3 hours. Take a cab there. And look for the train on the capital of a column. Well worth the time to get there!"

This museum tells the story of the azulejo - the ubiquitous decorative tile seen all over Portugal from the time it was brought to the country by the Moors, through its development as an art form across the sixteenth to early nineteenth centuries. From the early figurative tiles to geometry to art-works to the kind of \"statement\" (look for the set commissioned by the merchant telling his life story), it's all there and it is beautiful. Only the last leg after about 1850 when industrial production meant that it ceased to be an art form is in any way disappointing.(One other small point: the French-made documentary shown on the last stretch is like all French documentaries: too wordy and too long, but that's just nit-picking).Decent cafe downstairs serving good food at reasonable prices (\u20ac10 buys a main course and a coffee).

With beautiful exhibits and fascinating history of tile design in Portugal, it's worth visiting (and is just \u20ac5).There is a cafe and garden for refreshments on offer too."

The building is superbly suited for the role, with the original cloister and a number of chapels remaining, and the selection of tiles is amazing, starting from the 15th century right up to contemporary tiles. They start with Moorish influenced geometric tiles, and then flow through religious and various types of secular tiles. Don't miss the huge panoramic of Lisbon on the top floor created in 1755. Another nice feature is various points where the manufacturing and artistic techniques are explained and, unusually, while it loses its way occasionally there are explanatory boards in English almost throughout. I know a tile museum sounds a little esoteric, but if you have any interest in history, art, or construction technologies you'll enjoy this superb little specialist museum.On a practical note, we went on a Sunday and it was free, so I assume that this is the norm. Also given that it was pouring down we took our car and had no problems parking outside the museum."

The lighting is poorly arranged, shining so brightly on sections of the tiles that you can barely see them (and photos are ruined by the reflective glare). I thought this might be a ruse to sell more postcards in the shop - and would gladly have bought cards of my favourites - but selection of these is also poor.

Portugal has such a long history of tiles so if you are interested then please go and visit. Its free with the Lisboa card - 72 hours.It may not be the easiest to get to, bus only but still worth it. Then spend some time in the nice garden have a coffee and a friendly staff. The coffee is not over-priced for a museum at all and again, the staff is really polite and sweet."

This museum has easy to understand displays of the evolution of ceramic art from ancient times to the present. There are examples of tiles in all different styles from all time periods. On the top floor is a panorama in tile of the city of Lisbon, saved after an earthquake. There is a small coffee shop and a lovely courtyard for refreshments. The gift shop is tiny but exquisite. We took an affordable taxi from downtown to get to the museum, and it was well worth the trip. The museum building itself is beautiful and wandering through the halls brings an aesthetic delight at every turn."

One of the most remarkable things in Portugal generally and Lisbon and Porto in particular, is the widespread use of ceramic tile, both in geometric patterns and large scale \"painted\" scenes. It has been said that what the decorative art of fresco is in Italy, azulejos (tiles) is in Portugal. Whether you go to Sao Bento station in Porto, the university chapel in Coimbra, or the Arab Room of the Sintra National Palace you will see masterpieces of the art of decorative tile. In addition, many homes, churches and businesses in Portugal have elaborate and beautiful tile facades.The National Tile Museum provides a fantastic venue for starting to learn about and appreciate tile art. It has many wonderful examples of tile installation, most salvaged and saved from locations where they otherwise would have been lost. There is also considerable technical information about the hows and whys of Portuguese tile as well as historical background. Also on the premises is a restoration shop as well as displays of modern tile artists' work. It is really an enjoyable and valuable experience and an aid to appreciating Portuguese culture.Highly recommened"

We later realised that Museu Nacional do Azulejo translates to National Tile Museum (This was not mentioned in our Lonely Planet guide). As you can perhaps tell, we have absolutely zero interest in the area.Despite this, the museum does have some brilliant and beautiful tiles exhibited but little to no contextual information is displayed and so we left with no more knowledge of the history and origins of the tiles than what we had begun with. If you do happen to appreciate tiles then you may well enjoy the Museu Nacional do Azulejo with its impressive collection, but we couldn't help but wonder if our Lonely Planet guide was being sarcastic when it said that you hadn't visited Lisbon unless you'd visited this museum.(We apologise to the hardcore of the tile appreciation society for any offence caused, but a trip to Topps Tiles would probably be cheaper)"

Ask bus driver where to get of, he will certainly tell you where to get of. From there it is short walk to entrance. Museum has a really large collection of tiles and is still working on preserving more works and restarting complete mosaics. The building is also a cool get away on hot sunny days. When we visited in may 2014, we suddenly bumped into the first lady of turkey who paid a quick visit at the museum. Some of the works made me think of dutch 'Delfts Blue' porcelain. Except for old historic works there is also more modern tile-art to be seen. Although not in the best neighborhood we explore the streets around museum afterwards and shows some other scenes besides the touristic lisboncentre streets."

The bad: getting to the museum is a mission. On the website it only cites bus lines (the numbers) but not where to get them - so very useless. We decided to take the metro until Apolonia and then walk. Not very advisable. We followed the street under the highway next to the harbour - which did not feel particular safe - until the Lidl and then turned left and before the railway left again. Nothing is signposted - so we had to ask. Back we took a bus to Apolonia which was much easier, but I would advise people to take a taxi. Overall it dd not seem that the museum has a great interest to help people to find it. The book/gift shop was disappointing too. Every touristy shop in town has more postcards of Azulejos than the museum."

The building in itself is worth visiting - it's an old monastery with really beautiful cloisters, also perfect if you're in the company of very active children (like I was today - see below).There was a vast selection of tiles from about 1500 to your days, plus temporary exhibitions. It was just breathtakingly beautiful! While I was admiring the artworks, my kids were running in the corridors and cloisters, and the personnel didn't seem to care; but then again, most Portuguese seem to be very child-friendly (having lived three years in Germany, I know it's not the case everywhere!).The entrance fee was next to nothing - the family ticket only cost 5\u20ac. There's also a reasonably priced coffee shop/restaurant, serving quiches, salads, and crepes."

Haven't had such a cracking day since it was 3 for price of 2 at my local Tops Tiles store!This is a walk away from the last stop on the Metro Line (Santa Apol\u00f3nia on the blue line), as it was hot we took the easy 794 bus from in front of the train station. It goes right by, look for a massive church tight on your left, the entrance is through a area with big palms and nice plants.It's in an old church, and accordingly some of the museum is a church. There was lots to look at, it took a decent amount of time to get around, and to be honest I preferred it to the Gulbenkian art gallery. There is a really nice cafe-restaurant attached. Loads of bathrooms dotted about the place.It cost \u20ac5 to get in, though it's worth checking if they do free entries on Sundays (lots of the museums in Lisbon do). Outside and along is the massive Port with cranes, crates, trains, if you want something to look at."

We liked the material on how they are produced (more could be done on this though) and a good sense of how the artwork has developed into the twentieth century. We lost a touch of interest halfway through, in part because the tiles of the c17th-c19th become less distinct from other European art, but contemporary work at the end was also interesting.A bit of a trip out - I might not recommend for a 2-3 day Lisbon break but worth it if you have the time."

I'd recommend just getting the bus from Santa Apolonia or Restauradores, it is quicker and less hassle! The bus stops right outside the building too. Beautiful tiles which also shows the history of azulejos. My favourite was the azulejos showing the panoramic view of Lisbon on the top floor, showing Lisbon as it was prior to the 1755 earthquake. You can spot some of the landmarks that remain (Castle, Convento do Carmo etc.) but also many that no longer exist. Absolutely fascinating! The courtyard was very nice and looks like a nice place to sit and have lunch after your visit, but we came in the late afternoon and the cafe was closed. We spent an hour looking around.It's definitely a bit \"out of the way\" from the center of the city, but if you really want to learn more about azulejos/see some beautiful examples, I would 100% recommend coming here. I didn't manage to fit it in during my weekend trip in March as there was already so much to see, but now I am here for a few weeks this July, it was easy for me to make time to go."

You can also see tile restoration being done.It was a little difficult to get to, but worth the extra effort."

The museum will take 1 - 1.5 hours to explore. More if you are detail-oriented. Look for the 'chicken wedding' tiles--very interesting. My favorite part was watching the workers repairing historic tiles on the first level."

We got the metro so far and then tried to find the bus stop for the correct bus to get to it and couldn't and ended up walking quite a distance. In hindsight, I'd have got a taxi after we got off the metro. We did catch a bus from the stop outside on the way back.It was a much bigger collection than I'd have thought and the large panoramic tiled scene at the top was really interesting and impressive. There were tiles from the 1600's and 1700's in really good condition. There were also some modern pieces which were works of art. I'd recommend a visit."

A bit out of the way along the river but you can hoof it through the Alfama, past the military museum and along past the station, up the overpass path, turn left over the tracks, first right and about 1/2 mile. Again we got reduced entry. Take your time. You can get tiled out but there are good displays of the history of tiles in Portugal and the techniques used through the years for production. Also when we were there there were modern tiles with varied designs including some with Escher type optical illusions -really!The old convent church (that's where the museum is) is lovely and the art works well preserved. There is a very airy and light tea room serving drinks and fairly substantial snacks. Allow 2-3 hours for the visit. Afterwards when you leave cross the road and go left under the bridge then right. Brings you back out onto the main riverside road right by a bus stop where you can get right down to the Monasterio"

The building itself it also very interesting. We particularly loved the inner cloister, with its intricate stonework and lovely tiling. We also enjoyed the cafe in the large leafy courtyard, which is quiet and relaxing, and served a tasty, good value lunch. The only drawback it that some of the translations into English were obviously not done by a native speaker, and were sometimes incomprehensible! Also the museum is very low profile and hard to find - it's just off most city maps which seem to stop at Santa Apolonia. Best to look it up on Google maps. Coming on the the bus from town, there is no visible sign and we went past and had to walk back, asking people. If you go past Santa Apolonia Station and then go under a railwaybridge, get off! The museum is just back into town from the bridge, on the right going toward the city centre."

A nice cafeteria/restaurant with inside as well as outdoor seating in the 'court yard' can be found on the ground level.@ The museum: What could potentially enhance the experience even further is a bit of work on the information signs pinned to the different objects;- make the information signs bigger and use better material for them- use some nice font face and increase the size of the fonts- some more information in english (and possibly french as well) would be greatThese measures should be quite cheap and easy to implement - and would even further enhance the experience for the visitiors of this museum."

There are exhibits explaining the different processes used for making tiles through the centuries, along with examples illustrating the differences in form, style, and type of decoration. Most of the exhibit rooms have ramps making wheelchair access easy, and there is a lift to the second floor (although you do have to ask at the ticket counter to use it). The personnel in the museum were very helpful and courteous. The easiest way to get there is by taxi. It cost about six Euros from the city center. The taxi leaves you off at the entrance to a courtyard. You can catch a return taxi by flagging one down at that same courtyard entrance. The restaurant was quite good, and very reasonably priced. They had veal lasagna the day we ate there, and it was quite good. You can see the museum in an hour, but allow two if you really want to enjoy all of the tile exhibits. Walk the three major neighborhoods of Lisbon, visit Bel\u00e9m and Sintra, visit the Gulbenkian, but then by all means visit the National Tile Museum."

We got off the train on the water side and ended up having to cross a major highway bridge to get to the right side of the road. Lesson: if you take the train use the underpass to exit on the town side, not the water side. After a long walk to the tile museum we were rewarded with a well laid out, manageable museum. There are 3 floors around a central courtyard with well labeled signs to go into different rooms as you circle around. The chapel is a surprise and a delight.

It's a great way to learn the history of this art and there's even a hands-on area where you can create your own. One large tile depicts Lisbon before the earthquake. The setting is in the 16th Century convent of Madre de Deus. The convent's chapel is a Baroque wonder to behold. Decorated in paintings and (of course) tiles with its ceiling and choir in carved wood with rich gilt embellishments. It's easy to get to the museum by taxi. Entry fee is 5\u20ac and half price for seniors. And rounding it all out is a very nice restaurant."

The church, which features much gilding as well as azulejos (tile) friezes, is very grand and impressive, and the museum is housed in rooms off the cloisters. The culmination is the panorama of Lisbon, handpainted on tiles, on the second floor. There is also a good cafe/restaurant on site, with azulejos friezes of a smokery and kitchen, which serves good coffee and food - a necessity as you will want to take your time on this visit!"

Azuleijos are a big part of Portuguese tradition and although you can see a couple when walking around the city, this museum will really show you what they were all about. Throughout the rooms you will get to see how this art evolved from a very Moorish style when it arrived in Portugal, to its becoming of a very important part in portuguese culture.My favorite part of the museum was, however, the cathedral within it (the museum used to house monks and nuns). It is simply breathtaking and completely unexpected. Although it is not at all big, I spent a good 40 mins inside just trying to take it all in. Absolutely beautiful, and my favorite memory of Portugal.*Note: Getting here was somewhat difficult for us as the museum isn't close to many other tourist attractions; also, for some reason nobody seemed to know about the museum when we asked for directions which made it even harder to get there. After a half hour of searching we went into another museum where they finally helped us hail a cab and told the driver where to take us. This museum needs more advertising!"

The museum building is amazing being a historically important artefact in itself as well as providing a light and airy space to wander in. I learnt a lot about this ancient art and marvelled at the excellence and precision with which tiles were made in the past using basic, traditional methods. The technicality of how to produce different types of tile design is explained, with examples of how those techniques are applied, arranged in a timeline of the history of tiles, their uses and the significance of their patterns, in Portugal. The exhibition rooms and passage through them give a clear idea of how important tiles were for religious and secular purposes. Uses ranged from decorative - demonstrating status, wealth, etc., to narrative, particularly Biblical stories in a religious context, then to some which are quite obviously subversive having a satirical message or conveying political propaganda. Moving on to the modern displays I was particularly impressed at how versatile 'tiles' - or the tile making technique - could be artistically. It could give a whole new appreciation, when travelling the city and seeing houses or even whole blocks of flats clad in tiles, of the work involved to achieve the look."

We spent the whole afternoon browsing around the exhibits and meditating in the inspiring chapel. The exhibits have tiles from the past few hundred years all the way up to an exhibit of modern tile work by a contemporary artist. Can remember names but the website is sure to list info. The old convent is easy to reach by public transportation and costs only 5 Euros. Well worth it. Only sad thing is the courtyard garden which made me wish I had my clippers and gloves. So glad we took the time for this very special place."

There were very few other visitors when we came on a Tuesday in August, so we got some great photos. Flash is not allowed inside the exhibits but the lighting was good, so our photos turned out well. We spent about 2 hours browsing and then had lunch in the museum restaurant/cafeteria, which we were also very pleased with The restaurant/cafeteria has indoor and outdoor seating, and serves a variety of entrees, beverages, and snacks at reasonable prices. The gift shop is on the smallish side, but I found some pretty jewel boxes (<$30 USD) to take home as souvenirs. I also saw some gorgeous platters which were reasonably priced but too large for me to transport home. We spent about 4 hours at the museum \u2013 time very well spent.

Surprisingly engaging (my children, aged 10 and 7, were appreciative of many tile panels) there is perhaps not as much information offered in English for a deep understanding, but the artistry on display is enough to amaze. Of particular note is the tiled panorama of 18th century Lisbon, which shows the city before the devastating earthquake of 1755 that we had read about in our travel book. Fees were very reasonable, I paid 5 euro, but the kids were free. A nice day out was capped by a visit to the cafe/restaurant, which even out of some selections of food, held more tiles of kitchen scenes and opened onto a courtyard where we sat in a tranquil and lush garden."

My wife is more of a tile fan than I, but we were walking around Lisbon and happened upon this place so we thought we'd give it a go.Excellent call!Set in a lovely building, the highlight was, without any doubt, the (sadly temporary) exhibition \"submerged art\" by Sylvain Bongard - not tiles, to be sure, but amazingly detailed, often scary, always interesting art that one might find in the sea - from fishes to heads, tin cans to a watch. Ending November 2nd 2014, if you've been thinking of going but haven't yet got around to it I'd say, without hesitation - now is the time!"

For 5 euro you can see this converted convent that is beautifully decorated with originals from hundreds of years before. There is a lovely cloister in the center where you can have a coffee or lunch if you get tired. If you are into art and history, this is a must see!"

From the town centre you need to take either the 728 or 759 bus from Praca Comercio (near the arch) - watch out for going up and over the bridge at Xabregas (not over a river) and the bus then turns left away from the Tagus. Press the Stop button as soon as it turns, get off and stay on the river side of the railway, walking back towards the city - the museum is the second building on the right.The history of the tiles is pretty impressive, the examples are stunning. There is also a room dedicated to a huge fresco of the skyline pre-earthquake, and when we were there also a temporary exhibition by an artist who works in glazed fired clay made in a similar way to the tiles.The only slight downside was that we went for a quick bite and drink in the cafeteria afterwards. It took almost an hour for a cheese toastie to arrive, despite there being 4 staff and only about 8 customers. Disorganised to the extreme! So go elsewhere for your culinary needs - but do get to the tile museum if you can, it's far more interesting than you might think!"

Tiles are a big deal in Portugal; you see them in all sorts of places that wouldn't make sense elsewhere -- in churches, covering whole sides of houses, ... -- but in Lisbon it's just the done thing. Hence the tile museum, and undoubtedly browsing here is definitely to connect with something more genuinely Portuguese than the oceanarium.But, existing excellent reviews aside, it is just tiles. If you're not into tiles, chances are that you won't be blown away. I found several of the 20th century works most appealing, and was amused / bemused by some of the stranger and larger earlier frescos -- why would you go to the effort of making such a thing with tiles?! But after half an hour I was dawdling to pass the time, and overall didn't stay more than an hour. Unfortunately the explanations of the history and technique (at least the English ones) are limited to the first room and then you're on your own for tile after tile after tile.The building is the real star: the old convent has lovely stone collonades and cloisters, and the church and upstairs chapel and choir are quite remarkably ornate (and tiled, of course). Worth going for that alone, I think: if you want to visit one Lisbon church before going to the oceanarium, this is a pretty cool one... and you get to see some quite silly satirical tile frescos, too."

We enjoyed reading about the history of the tiles and the fact that it was not crowded. We were able to take our time and look at everything at a relaxed pace. There are some stunning displays. The area next to the cafeteria is a nice place to sit and relax after the visit. Friendly staff"

Great way to spend the day with family, kids, friends. Keep up the good work!!"

After having seen different churches with beautifully coloured tile decorated walls, we decided to visit the National Tile Museum as well. Off the beaten path, but easily accessible by bus (794 from Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o or 742 from near Saldanha), set in a beautiful old convent, it turned out to be a charming little museum. The entry fee is very modest (5 EUR). The collection is quite small, we finished the visit in one hour. The old convent is quite beautiful, you can walk through the cloister, closed with windows, through which you can easily see piles of tiles being classified and curated, I imagine. During the tour you also get to see one or two chapels and a view of the church from the top, all beautiful.  There are different sections classifying the tiles, motives and patterns by historical periods, from islamic and gothic tiles to 17-18th centuries and then contemporary period. Most tiles come from palaces and churches/convents. They have beautiful big panels and virtually paintings on tiles, from the simple ones with blue on white faience to the more coloured ones, representing religious scenes, floral or textile motives, maritime, courtly or hunting scenes, sometimes covering entire walls. Don't miss the great panoramic view of Lisbon before the great earthquake of 1755. In blue and white, straddling over an entire room, it depicts the countless number of palaces, churches and convents, with little explanatory notes on their subsequent fate and current status that made Lisbon centuries ago. It is worth a visit if you're into ceramics, although I think it could improve the story behind the painted tile as fundamental element of the portuguese identity, it could offer more information and there is room for improvement in the small museum shop."

Not particularly impressive. The contents however were grand. There are two floors of tile samples to see, from 500 years ago to relatively modern. You can watch the curators catalog and clean tiles saved from old buildings. Typical museum material. I think my wife liked it more than I did. Pretty inexpensive to visit. If you like seeing the old tiles on Portuguese buildings, go to the museum."

There is a bus line that passes within a block of the museum. Be sure to tell the driver that you want to go to the tile museum (museo azulejos), and he will let you know where to alight. There is very little signage to point the way. From the bus stop, cross the road, go under the railroad trestle, and stay to the left. The entrance to the museum is down around a curve, near a crosswalk. To get a bus back to town, you need to walk back out to the main road that runs along the waterfront (only a couple of blocks from the museum). There is a big Lidl supermarket on the corner. You will see a bus shelter on the main road. I found that Google directions give precise, helpful instructions. Just click on the icon for public transit and it tells you bus number, number of stops, and the name of the bus stop for your destination.

The collection and the explanation is most important to understand the existence of these tiles-Azulejos in Portugal all over.One can say \" A Portuguese is born in a hospital full of Azulejos, prays in churchs decorated with Azulejos, takes the metro in stations surrounded with Azulejos on the walls, listens to music in Fado restaurants among Azulejos and is buried in a cemetery with walls and gates made of Azulejos\"."

It is out of the way, there's nothing really in the surroundings which seems sketchy too, but it is worth the visit IF you're into art, tiles, etc. Otherwise skip it because you'll find it boring. It is, however, a very interesting collection. Don't miss the huge tile panel of Lisboa before the earthquake: it is overwhelmingly beautiful!!! The only down part is that for the fee they charge, it seems as if the venue should be in better conditions. It is worn off, showing lack of conservation, and the smell of mold is a bit too much in some of the rooms. Other than that, it is worth adding to the list."

Leonor (1458-1525)\". The museum is a bit out of the way. However we caught the 794 bus from Santa Apol\u00f3nia and it stops outside the museum. My recommendation is to tell the driver when boarding. Our driver was extremely helpful both on the way there and coincidently on the way back.The museum is free on Sunday till 14:00 and also with the Lisboa card.After spending about 1.5 hours in the museum we had a drink and baguette at the museum's very pleasant and reasonably priced cafeteria."

Taxi is another way to get there.Superb collection in a former nunnery - complete with a marvelous gilt and tile chapel. Fairly quiet when we were there, so it is relaxing. Lovely courtyard cafe, too. Get out of the crowds, and see some real Portugal."

Sublimely pleasant cafe with inside garden courtyard tables, wine or beer and unexpectedly fine food (far, far better than at the Gulbenkian museum at the city's north end).

We took the 759 bus from Plaza Figueira and the bus driver was kind enough to tell us when to get off! From the bus stop, you cross the street and walk down towards a church and it is on the right side of the road. We thoroughly enjoyed every room from the early tile work to the church to the modern tile work.... but best of all is the panorama tile composition at the very top floor of Lisbon pre-earthquake! I would recommend going at the end of your trip so you can recognize what is what on that panorama. Neat little gift shop as well and friendly staff, plus a cheap cafe inside! We took a little over an hour and saw everything we wanted to see."

There are rooms and rooms of azulejos but somehow you never tire of the changing colours, patterns, techniques. There are some English translations of signs, and videos. I was amazed when i walked into the Igreja da Madre de Deus, the chapel of the convent. Lined with tiles and gold decorations it is stunning - a very special place to experience. And don't think you have seen it all until you climb to the top floor to see the tile panorama of Lisbon depicting the city before the 1755 earthquake. Extremely detailed and great to examine after a few days exploring Lisbon, so you can picture where palaces, monasteries, bridges etc were, and what remains. The cafe is pleasant with hot and cold dishes and a nice outdoor terrace. The shop offers great cards, scarves, textiles and .....tiles!"

Inside the museum there are 100s of tiles and we spent the afternoon exploring all the floors. The church is a bit of a surprise and completely over the top.

We were in love with the iznik we saw in Istanbul, and the Spanish azulejos we have seen in places like Cordoba.So I made sure to visit this museum on our first day in Lisbon, and this was the perfect plan. The combination of the incredible collection of tiles from 4 centuries and the convent rooms all decorated in tile just delighted us beyond description. I even liked (some) of the modern tiles!The highlight of the collection has to be the 18th-century (pre-earthquake) map of the city in tile, filling an entire gallery on the top of the museum. They call it the panorama I believe. Just spectacular.The museum's cafe is very nice - with some refreshing and filling salads. The waiter there seems easily overwhelmed, but if you are patient, it is just the most tranquil spot, perfect for refreshment and contemplation of the museum's riches!"

We were pleasantly surprised with not just a chronological showcase of tiles but probably the most decadent displays of paintings and religious artifacts in gold in a convent. Like other reviews, the directional signs weren't prominently displayed but we thoroughly enjoyed this hidden gem. Too bad it's not as well advertised especially with signage on road ways. Be sure to see the panoramic tile collection near the end. It is amazing and ceramic artistry at its best."

If vacations had themes, our trip to Portugal would have a theme of azulejos, the elaborate tiles that the Portuguese used to decorate their homes, churches and government buildings (inside and out). They range from abstract geometrical designs, to floral patterns, to portraits, panoramas and history lessons. The originals were white and blue (thus \"azulejos\" - azul is the Portuguese word for blue), but quickly expanded the palette to every color in the spectrum. The Tile Museum is a double pleasure: not only does it provide wonderful examples of tile artistry through history, but it is housed in the former Mother of God Convent and some of the art from the convent has been preserved in several rooms. Some will find the tiles from the 20th century, including a Cubist rendering, not to their taste, but I found them a pleasant diversion from the more traditional themse of older tiles. On the other hand, there could be nothing more whimsical than the huge tiled presentation of \"the chicken's wedding\", with baboons as the coach drivers, etc. Also, don't miss the cafe - good food and a delightful garden seating area.The only drawback to the Museum is its location, in the far eastern Lisbon neighborhood of Xabregas, along the river about halfway between Alfama and Nations' Park. I believe there are buses available."

On Sunday morning entry is free, so that's probably the best time to plan a trip if your schedule allows.Note: The museum can be reached by bus (easy to catch from the Praca do Comercio) or a walk through the Alfama. If you're in the Praca do Comerico (the main square in Lisbon) then stop by the tourist office on the Northwest side of the square and they will help you figure out what bus to take. The museum isn't the greatest part of town (not particularly scenic) so plan on walking up through the Alfama or catching the bus back into town after your visit."

Based on the condition of the tape, it had been there awhile.The staff also weren't especially helpful or interested in answering questions."

The National Tile Museum has positively got to be one of THE best places in Portugal to visit to experience the uniqueness (and perhaps one might even use the word, \"genius\" in this respect) of the traditional Portuguese aesthetic!! Firstly, the museum is housed in the architectural gem of the \"Manueline\" Convent of Madre de Deus situated on what was once almost the shoreline of the River Tejo. The main portal of the building is, I think, an almost-perfect 19th c. reconstruction of the original \"Manueline\" doorway. The church in this convent ( I do not know how much of what one sees today has been re-built/restored and how much of it actually survived the earthquake of 1755, because the unity of guilded wooden carving and wall tiles and paintings on the cofferred ceiling look perfectly harmonious....) is a wonderful amalgamation of artistic \"churchwork\"--e.g. guilded carved wood, paintings, tiles, etc.-- from the 16th through 19th centuries. Secondly, the collection of TILES here , exhibited chronologically from the 15th c.through to the 21st c.,, is unequalled for their range and quality---they have much of \"the BEST of the best\" on display in their permanent collection---including an incredible, and vast, early 18th c. blue and white tile \"panorama\" pictorial view , from the river , of the Lisbon shoreline BEFORE the earthquake of 1755!! --- and there is at present also an excellently-curated temporary exhibition of tile panels and relevant ceramics. Thirdly, and reason enough to visit this museum if only for this, is their cafe: It is adjacent to a quite salubrious and lovely shaded garden area (in which one can eat and drink and relax when the weather permits). The cafe's walls are themselves covered with a totally UNIQUE and idiosyncratic set of 19th c.\"kitchen\" azulejos depicting a riot of food products--fish, chorizos, hares, \"leitao\" (suckling pigs), game birds, gourds, cheeses etc.etc. all \"hung\" , that is, depicted as though these were actually hanging from the walls! .And even if the food offerred weren't quite good (which it actually IS!!), sitting and eating among these tiles alone would be reason enough to take a meal here!! This Museum is absolutely NOT a place to be missed when visiting Lisboa!!"

So you can see how tiles developed over time. Some of the examples are staggering. The highlight is a wall which must be 15 metres wide at least which is a picture made up of tiles of Lisbon as it looked from the river before the earthquake of 1755. This museum is well worth a visit - spending a couple of hours looking at tiles sounds boring, but it isn't - it's fascinating and I would recommend it.

The style is baroque and the walls of the chapel and ceiling are filled with huge paintings, all in gold colored frames. The artwork in the chapel is outstanding and impressive. We did not expect to see such a beautiful chapel. It is really a big church, and not a chapel. In the rooms of the former convent, one can see the history of the ceramic tile in Europe, especially in Portugal. The Portuguese became famous making ceramic tile with blue painted scenes.

Every where you go you see it used in so many ways, the sidewalks, walls, decor... tile. Why not see how they make it and the beauty up close. Photography is allowed. The setting is the old Convent of the Nuns of St. Claire. It makes the perfect place for the museum. It was an unexpected surprise to see the chapel and the blending of the tile work inside is a must see. Well done museum. Grab a bite in the cafe, there isn't much to eat in the area. It is simple fare but fresh and the outdoor cafe is enjoyable. Staff could learn to smile and be grateful for the tourist but it didn't take away from the meal."

Its easy to get to from town - 794 bus from Comercio Square and takes about 10mins.The museum is set in a beautiful grand house, which is a sight in itself.

The Chapel on the ground floor and the Panorama of Lisbon before the 1755 earthquake on the top floor are noteworthy, but the whole collection is interesting and varied.The easiest way to get there is by the 794 bus that drops you directly outside the Museum. Catch it from Praca do Comercio or the Terreiro Paco bus stops in town. Get off at stop Igreja Madre Deus and just cross the road. To get back into town the stop is to the right of the exit on the same side of the street."

The Tile Museum (Museu Nacional do Azulejo) was a former convent with incredible tiles on the walls everywhere. The state has now taken it over, preserved the tiles and converted many of the rooms into a museum with exhibitions about tile making and with many beautiful historical tiles. The Moors brought ceramic tile making into Portugal many centuries ago and it is still a major industry of Portugal. This museum is a great way to learn about this part of Portuguese heritage. We walked through many of the exhibitions and learned about ceramic tiles and tile making and then we arrived at something you should not miss. The Sala do Capitulo, or Chapter House, is a chapel where the nuns held their services. It is magnificent \u2013 the only church I have ever seen with incredible ceramic tiles on the walls, depicting religious scenes or just beautiful artwork."

The museum is located in a former convent which itself is extensively tiled -- so the visit consists of viewing both the tiles and exhibitions as well as the building and tiles in situ. There is a good explanation of the history of tile making, the tile making process and how tile making evolved over time. We now know how, when looking at a tiled wall, to distinguish the truly old tiles (with the three spots in the glaze) from later replacements (without those spots).There is a magnificent chapel (see attached photo) as well as an impressive cloister -- both extensively tiled. Walking the cloister one sees how the tiles were designed to give instruction and admonition to the women of the convent. (An example is in one of the attached photos.) However, as also shown in an attached photo, not all of the tiles on display are of a religious nature. (One of the most amusing is that of the Wedding of the Chicken.)The museum is a couple of miles east of the city center. One can reach it by a 20-minute walk from Santa Apolonia station or by bus 794 from Terreiro do Paco (just east of Praca do Comercio) or Santa Apolonia. Admission is included in the Lisboa Card. It is truly a worthwhile, and enjoyable, place to visit."

Tiles are a feature of Lisbon, and this museum tells you about them, and shows a large historical selection, but it's the building itself that is really special. It is an old convent, with excellent tiles in its cloisters, and a staggering church, where every surface that isn't tiled is either painted or gilt. The best exhibit as such is the 18 metre long tile panorama of Lisbon before the 1755 earthquake, which really helps understand the city. Also not to be missed is the convent's 18th century crib set, in the tiled St.Anthony chapel. The cafe is very good as well."

Not only the collection of tiles but also the building itself deserves our attention. There are two cloisters (one in Manueline style), an upper and lower choir, a richly decorated church and a chapterroom.The permanent collection starts with an explanation of the different production methods. Then some rooms are dedicated to the early Hispano-Moresque Tiles. The next rooms are dedicated to the early Portuguese tiles. Other rooms show the Oriental influence.....Finally on the top floor there is the Panoramic View of Lisbon that shows us the city before the great earthquake."

About the first thing a new tourist in Lisbon notices is the vast volume of tile on both the inside and outside of (almost) all the buildings. Very attractive, very distinctive. The Museum traces the history of tiles in Portugal, including a very wide array of displayed tiles, both decorative and artistic, and some thoroughly informative displays on how they're made. The museum is inside a former convent, in the visit, and it is spectacularly beautiful, including the church altars and paintings on the walls and ceilings. One real highlight, up on the top floor, is a panoramic view of pre-earthquake Lisbon, all done in painted tiles. Many present day landmarks are still readily visible in the panorama, as well the depiction of many churches and buildings that were destroyed in the earthquake. We figured we'd spend an hour at the Tile Museum. We ended up spending about three very entertaining hours there. A must-see in Lisbon!"

OK, so you have to be interested in tiles, and I had very very low expectations - but I was surprised how much I enjoyed all the tiles from different eras, and especially modern artists. The best was the huge tile painting of old Lisbon, where you could pick out the structures from a few hundred years ago that had stayed around, and those that had appeared later, or disappeared altogether. Altogether very enjoyable and surprising!"

While we generally use tile INside our homes, so many bldgs have them on the exterior - in brilliant colors and patterns. Worthy of a visit to learn more about the different patterns and history. The tiles are ubiquitous throughout Portugal. This museum will give a deeper appreciation for the architecture/buildings as you enjoy your stay. Very well done and only requires a couple hours of time. worth it!"

Sure, you can see gorgeous tile, learn about the origins, how it's made (very interesting as described), but this place is worth seeing just for the incredible chapel. Picture the most ornate one you've seen and add a ton of tile work-- it adds beauty and serenity, definitely worth seeing. BONUS: if you think \"relics\" are interesting, then this is the place for you! In a small chapel, dozens of different little statues with glass containers built-in house various pieces of bones. Really fascinating. Museum visit takes about an hour and you should plan on 15-20 minutes each way from city center via bus or tram."
