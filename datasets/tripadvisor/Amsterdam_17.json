The birds particularly were fascinating to watch."

I have to say the aquarium section of the Zoo was Amazing ! We loved it and would recommend it based on that even alone ! Great little carts for putting toddlers around in which were cool !

I like their promise to never get any more animals and try the best for the ones that already live there. A new born elephant is now in that family. The price of the tickets though is way too high. I used to get the annual member card but I can't afford that at the moment either. It would be nice if they now and then give some discount offer for more ppl to get the chance to visit the zoo. But I know that the cost to keep everything well is really huge."

I know a lot of people don't, but for me the captive breeding programmes and educational value alone make them near essential. Getting close to our fellow creatures is also a bonus. Amsterdam zoo represents all that is best in zoos. Animal welfare is clearly at the top of their agenda as well as trying to educate folks (the place was full of school kids when we went). It isn't the biggest zoo in the world, but has a good array of animals (the aquarium is particularly impressive). The African hunting dogs are a nice touch too. And, there are lions, giraffes and other crowd pleasers too.There is a good range of grub and a wonderful diorama. The gift shop has a good range too. Go - it's great."

It is not too big and a takes a few hours ( about 3 hours) to enjoy this place. Of course,you can spend more time if you love animals and spend the entire day. It costs about 20 euros for entry. It has lots to see like Giraffes, Zebras, deers,Elephants, wolves, lions, birds, buttrerlfy house and also a large Aquarium. Some of you may feel that there isn't much room for the animals but they look well cared for.I have been to this place twice and with children. They loved it too."

It blew here mind; we started at the Planetarium with an animated trip through space to distant galaxies revealed by the Hubble telescope. We then wandered among many small primates in an exhibit with tarsirs, sloth, marmosets and flying foxes loose in the room, toured the whole scene and ended up with the aquarium which shows an underwater view of the Amsterdam canals. It is impossible to list all of the cool stuff; we spent a day there and had a picnic. So fine, as Ray Davies says: \"I wanna Be An Apeman!\" Enjoy!"

            "review": "Outstanding Collection of Asian Animals. This is an outstanding zoo. A few things struck me immediately. First, there is very little that separates the animals from the visitor. I was amazed at how close some of the animals, such as the spider monkeys, can come to an individual. No way that would fly in the States. Secondly, the lack of sufficient restroom facilities...the perpetual issue in Europe.The butterfly building is beautiful. A great habitat to show case a wonderful collection. Although we have seen bigger and more diverse butterflies, this is one of the biggest habitats and more beautifully landscaped exhibits we have ever seen.Kudos to the zoo for having such a diversified collection of animals represented here. There were so many animals we have never seen in American zoos. The white throated martins and the Malaysian tapirs are just 2 examples of rare and unusual species not found in American zoos. For the most part, the exhibits are well done and suitable, although I found a few of the habitats dated. It appears the zoo is undergoing a major construction project so hopefully some of the old, less spacious enclosures will be done away with.We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. Between the aquarium and the indoor and outdoor exhibits there is so much eye candy. The staff was extremely friendly and willing to answer questions. It appears to be a well run outfit.The entry fee is high...well over 50 euros for the 2 of us. They do not give out free maps. We had to purchase a map for an additional 2 euro fee. That irked me. There is no reason for it.You can easily spend the majority of the day here. There is so much going on. Definitely worth the effort to visit if you are in Amsterdam."

That said its an excellent tourist attraction with so much to do and see and lots of different eating areas, a beautiful place to spend the day."

Often in a zoo you see that the animals are treated to lovely enclosures whilst the humans walk around in an area much less pretty, but not with Artis. The animals looked well looked after and the garden elements were beautiful, but what more can you really say about a zoo other than the fact that it's a zoo and they're all pretty much the same!!

Unfortunately there wasn't a lot of information given about the animals and no large map of the zoo. We had to find our way by a few signposts. We had been offered the chance to buy a map with our tickets but there was no later opportunity and no map inside.

Tram 9 from Amsterdam Central station takes you practically to the entrance and a return fare is quite reasonably priced. The entrance fee for the zoo is comparable with any although maybe more expensive than normal just now because of \u20ac/\u00a3 exchange! We were very lucky though as we approached, a lovely Dutch couple gave us a voucher for free entry for two adults as part of a supermarket special offer! The zoo is flat, easy to walk and easy to navigate and the variety of exhibits is super with all the usual and many that are not. We stopped for a drink and a bit of cake and were pleasantly pleased with the price. The caf\u00e9s were very clean too! Overall, well worth a family visit!!"

This zoo is perfect to go to with kids, and yes I am aware that zoo's are usually focussed on marketing.Since my childhood this zoo has stayed the same except for minor changes. There is a huge play ground in to east part of the park including a buffet restaurant which is highly expensive for what you get. In my opinion the zoo is outdated and with the major environmental uprising in the media and in general: the zoo is not very a frontier in making their animals comfortable.I remember Artis having a polar bear (which now they dont have anymore I think) and he was always walking the exact same route over and over again, the tigers and lions to it as well.There are better zoo's in the Netherlands although on distance from Amsterdam. For example Safari Zoo where you can go on a boat trip to see animals, walking, or even in your own car. You also have Apenheul where the monkeys can walk up to you.I must say I am not a supporter of animal captivity for commercial activities or personal collection, especially when it comes to wild animals. Although in some ways it protects them from for example rhino poaching.The time spend here with my friends was very enjoyable and had a lot of fun. The zoo is a great place to go to with young children; thats it really :/"

The zoo, like Amsterdam, has a certain informality about it and while the animals are mainly in their own areas, they feel very closely - in fact the Lemurs were out and about in the crowd and raiding prams and bags for treats (or they did until the staff rounded them back up!) and this added to the fun atmosphere of the place. I genuinely loved it and so did my daughters who are both teenagers and therefore a tough age group to please!I would thoroughly recommend a visit to the zoo to anyone as it is a lovely, relaxed day out, with a wide and varied selection of animals to see."

The aquarium was very good as was the bird, / woodland house, where the birds and bats were all around, as well as the butterfly house. Some exhibits were \"old fashioned\" in that they didn't seem adequate for the animals housed, along with poor opportunities to see the animals, in particular the lions enclosure which was very small, there is work going on to give the elephants greater space, so I assume they'll get round to the lions eventually! The setting is lovely though , with majestic trees providing shade etc, well worth a visit. You can also \"escape\" with out going through the gift shop, which may appeal to parents!"

One of the elephants wanted to go back inside but couldn't and frankly looked distressed waving from side to side by the door and tapping his trunk on it. The Sea Lion cut a lonely figure and the penguins didn't seem to have anywhere to swim properly (more like paddle). Many of the children seemed to be enjoying themselves and the zoo is popular with families but maybe we've been spoilt by Colchester, London and wild life parks where the animals have more room on the whole."

There does seem to be a lot of investment in the zoo currently which is addressing these issues. A new jaguar enclosure is almost finished. And the beautiful elephants will soon have a shiny new and more spacious home. Ultimately animals belong in the wild, however the sad truth is that as long as we continue encroaching into these species habitats, zoos will always exist, the best taking part in international breeding programmes to ensure species survival as artis does. Highlights for me were the gorillas, giraffes and elephants. I was also able to get incredibly close to a two toed sloth, some pygmy marmosets and a white faced saki. Being particularly fond of monkeys I was like a kid in a sweet shop."

Toilets and restaurants are placed at intervals around the park. We dined in the largest restaurant next to the giraffes we got a huge meal for \u20ac9 and none of us could finish it, it was delicious. I am glad that they are expanding some of the enclosures because one of the elephants was swaying from side to side. The other enclosures though are very good and most animals looked content. It is a lot of walking but well worth it and they even have pull along buggy things for any smaller children. Good money and if you are into science definitely go to the microbe museum!"

That I totally do not agree with. As much as I love going to the zoo and seeing all these amazing animals in person, there is this conflict between is it really for the animals or is it just for the public show? I felt that when seeing some of the animals e.g the lions, seals, penguins and alligators. It is however a beautiful zoo and kids would love it. Great outing for the day!"

There was definitely so much to see and we spent so long here, we weren't interested in the Micropia though. I'd definitely recommend spending a couple of euros on the map because you'll definitely need it! A lot of the animal enclosures are so much closer than we're used to with zoos in the UK so that was a nice surprise. There were definitely a few animals which were lose within the enclosures such as the small monkey house and the lemur walk through. The zoo is absolutely huge, believe me it doesn't look it from the outside. It's a great day for families and couples, would highly recommend!"

As the zo was at the end of the road to our apartment, it would have been rude to not have gone - also the fact I am a HUGE animal lover.Zoos I am torn about. I hate the fact that these animals are enclosed, especially large animals such a Lions, Giraffes and Elephants. They almost look distressed, the space they have in any zoo is inadequate. So I try my best not to support zoos, however, what would happen if we didn't go, to the animals who are currently held in captivity there.Anyway, enough of my ranting!The zoos was the largest I have been to, lots of things going on, watching the penguins being fed was a highlight, the way the looked at the zookeeper was just adorable.The part I was most surprised with was the reptile house, as a keeper of reptiles I was at awe in what was there, I loved the whole day, the experience.The only thing that let it down was the cost, I found it to be the most expensive thing we did all of our trip, but I am glad that we went.Must see the sealions and penguins!! Fantastic day!"

All the usual ones you expect like giraffes, penguins, lemurs, elephants, vultures, monkeys etc.For a city centre zoo it is fairly large. There is a performing sea lion show and a Punch & Judy show (when do you ever see them now?) for the kids.One criticism: the single lion wasn't in a very natural environment though, poor soul.There is an additional educational attraction called Micropia which has an additional charge to visit (we didn't go there).Good day out."

The only thing negative I would say is, I don't think they should have the bigger animals there... giraffes, zebras, lions.

The aquarium was also good. Easy to reach the zoo from the centre of Amsterdam, just a few stops on the tram. Everywhere was very clean and tidy and it was nice to see evidence that they are continually improving things, they are building a big new enclosure for the elephants at the moment which looks like it will be really good.

We must have hung out in that area taking photos and talking to the docent for 20-30 minutes. They had a large variety of animals that we don't get to see in many zoos. Their giant anteater was a treat for us to see, their lemurs were awesome and there were many other animals that we saw that were so interesting to see (but I can't remember the names of their species). For us, it was one of the most pleasant surprises of our trip. If you are a zoo lover, this is one that you shouldn't miss. They also had beautiful gardens and statues. It was simply beautiful."

The enclosures are thoughtfully laid out so it doesn't feel like the animals are trapped, and they're all easy to observe.The highlight is probably the aquarium, which is huge and has a variety of types of fish. The planetarium was also a disappointment, since the chairs don't recline and the show was really more of a video shown on a large screen.Overall, an enjoyable day out and a worthwhile visit, especially so close to the centre of a city."

I guess we were influenced by the petting area at Berlin Zoo which was great. This area had about 8 animals total, the gate was off its hinges and leaning against the entryway, you could not buy food pellets to feed them and they all seemed drowsy and as bored as we were. The snack wagons scattered about were pretty good. There was a definite lack of zoo keeper presence which again I was not used to and there was no play area for children as such.

If you plan on using the public transportation and seeing some of the other Museum's in Amsterdam, you might be better off getting the I Amsterdam card that at the time of this review included entry into the Artis Zoo."

They have an amazing variety of species, and many artistic beautiful areas to explore and appreciate. The most wonderful part was that the animals seemed to be happy and well cared for. They were active, engaged, stimulated, and appeared relaxed and content. What better recommendation can a zoo have? (And it's free if you have an \"I Amsterdam City Card\" for tourists!)P.S. I realize there are some animal-lovers who hate cages and zoos in general (though they kennel their dogs, declaw their indoor cats, and keep their fish in aquariums). Don't forget that well-cared-for zoo animals get free food, free health care, complete safety, and have much better health and longer lifespans than their wild brethren. They have social companionship, guaranteed mates, and a large chance that their offspring will live to adulthood. Zoo animals act as ambassadors for all of the natural world. Seeing real wild animals educates and inspires children and adults to care for the environment, and protect natural habitats and endangered species. Sometimes the species conservation and breeding that is done is zoos is the only hope that endangered species have for survival, and perhaps eventual reintroduction to the wild. So a good zoo is an important and valuable thing."

We also were lucky to see Rotterdams zoo which is bigger and offers a large aquarium with its speciies of shark / turtles / stingrays really does take number 1 spot in terms of zoos to visit in the netherlands. Nevertheless I would recommend Artis if you are in Amsterdam and can't get to Rotterdam."

Loads of animals to look at and a very nice clean place to walk around, we found some of the enclosures a little bit small for the amount of animals in the area for example there was 5-6 lions in one area that was very small I think they had a door to another area behind the scenes but that was shut so they were stuck in the small area but they looked happy enough. The best part of the zoo for ourselves was the butterfly greenhouse! It was amazing to see so many beautiful butterfly flying around freely. We stopped at the lil cafe by the butterfly's and had hot dog and a beer then carried on exploring the main down side to the zoo was the planetarium - honestly they shouldn't advertise that they have it!!! It's hardly worth being there! So don't waste your time even looking! But the rest of the zoo was brilliant and worth the trip! We walked from dam square took us about 20mins would be a nice cycle and you can catch a tram there! We caught the tram back to dam square \u20ac2.90 to jump on and off for an hr we just did the one trip as it was nice to see different part of the city."

We loved the butterfly enclosure where you can see them all flying around very close to you. We had a very special day (took a picnic with us and ate in the middle of the zoo in their beautiful gardens). Would definitely recommend to families and animal lovers - you won't be disappointed."

First impression was that this was quite an expensive attraction - no family or student discounts; 80 euros for the 4 of us. However, once inside you realise that the price does reflect the quality of the experience. There is so much to see and do. We stayed for 5 hours and still didn't make it to the planetarium or aquarium! My daughters loved the butterfly house - a good attraction in its own right.Generally the animals seemed content and very well looked after. Most enclosures were fairly natural looking but also allowed visitors to get close to the animals. There's a new elephant enclosure being built which will give them a lot more room which is good. The only compound that I was not pleased to see was a sandy patch near the front of the zoo where camels, African cows, donkeys and reindeer were stood motionless in the sun. No grass and nothing to do. Difficult to think this was a suitable and enriching space for the reindeer in particular. Ok if it was just for an hour or two but they were there for the whole of our visit. Felt sorry for them. The only other thing that stopped this being a 5 star attraction was the lack of free drinking water for visitors. Making visitors rely on 3 euro bottles of water comes across as money grabbing."

It's a timeless classic and let's you see a different aspect of something that you're used to in your own part of the world. This is a very calming and enjoyable experience smack dab in the middle of a hustling and bustling people-packed city. My friends and I really made a day of it. We enjoyed seeing all of the animals, casually walking without all the main city tourists crowding the walk ways. The animals were in very good condition and you can tell that this zoo really takes care of everything from the animals, the building facilities, and even the landscape. I was throughly pleased. In fact, I have more pictures from the zoo then I do from the entire rest of my 10 day trip to Holland. We stopped for lunch at the caf\u00e9 inside the zoo (right near the giraffe\u2019s). It was quite windy so we opted to eat inside rather than outside. They had a great variety of food, snack, beverage and dessert options. The only thing I didn\u2019t like about the restaurant was when my friend loaded our tray with condiments for his food and when we got to the cashier, they said there was a charge per packet. I told him he was crazy and to put them all back except for how many he actually needed. LOL Coincidentally, this is also where I fell in love with Curry Ketchup for the first time. We had an excellent lunch conversing and went back out to enjoy the second half of the zoo. There was really a lot to see here. More than I expected for hearing that it was a small zoo. Aside from the many cafes we visited in the city and the canal ride, (being a lover of animals) this was truly one of the highlights of my trip. If you have time, I recommend going during your trip. We went early to mid-morning and the crowd was just right. We stayed until about an hour or two before it closed. We also really enjoyed the butterfly enclosure. So much fun!"

The zoo map was beautifully made with clear illustrations (unfortunately no English but clear enough without) and zoo signs were bilingual so we could understand the main points of info on their various inhabitants. I was not anticipating the sheer range of animals they are looking after - from firm family favourites of big cats, monkeys, etc to my personal favourites (sloth, anteaters, tropical birds). The vulture section is fascinating - do not miss feeding time unless you are with small children as it is a bit gory! Small tots will enjoy the penguin feeding, though the guide will speak in Dutch unless you go to designated English showings. We unfortunately missed the planetarium showings. The zoo have designed their enclosures in such a way that allows the visitors to get as close to the animals as is safely possible without the use of bars. Very clever and really engaging. The cheetah self serve restaurant is a marvel - so many options and the food is top notch. Again, I was expecting simple fare and I came away having had some good wine and a burger cooked fresh in front of me with all the trimmings. My partner sampled some of their extensive pastry offerings. A fantastic lunch! All in all, a wonderful way to spend the whole of our last day in Amsterdam!"

We was close enough to walk to the zoo and we paid about 20 euros each but we was there between 3-4 hours and could have stayed longer. Strangely the zoo was not well advertised we thought so our expectations were low but they have many animals and have converted an old building into something of a museum. The scenery and grounds are beautiful and kept well. I think you can get a better deal for families with young ones who would really love this day out. I noticed that there were groups of young ones with schools or clubs who really seemed to have fun here. Well worth a visit."

Our daughters, 10 and 12, thoroughly enjoyed seeing all the animals -- many in large, more natural enclosures than cages -- and found the variety to be incredible. You can get there easily enough on public transportation but we chose to walk from Central Station (15 minutes), and it gave us a bit of great sightseeing along the way of canals, shops, and parks. Many of the information displays are in English as well as other languages, and the staff polite. Our favorites were the gorilla house and the most entertaining chimpanzee exhibit. Would definitely go again and it was a relaxing break from the hectic frenzy of the city."

Some got in our pram and tried to eat our daughters packet of sultanas! You could easily take a picnic and eat on some of the grassed area. There was a playground that had water play so I wished I had bought a towel and bathers for my daughter. There was also another water play area immediately outside the exit of the zoo. We didn't find anywhere fantastic for lunch inside the zoo, but there was a nice ice-cream cart and a mini blini cart that were delicious. Cash only for those carts."

The Artis zoo is over 100 years old and occupies its place in the centre of the city with an ease not usually afforded to Zoos in newer more contemporary cities. Many Amsterdammers enjoy all year round views of some rare and exotic creatures. If the spaces for the animals are smaller than some people would are nowadays happy with, there are no hard pens or concrete bunkers here, the beautifully maintained grounds and wonderful canopy of tall trees make a meandering journey through the zoo on a sunny day, seem like a stroll through the surrounds of Shangri-La! The arts & crafts designed buildings are beautiful in themselves and reflect the Amsterdam School, so worth a visit for anyone with an interest in architecture. Enjoy a meal overlooking a pool with elegant pink flamingos, the restaurant is way better then expected. The Zoo is also a natural history museum, with exhibits to keep children amused and interested all year round, wet or dry. The small size of the Zoo has other benefits too; Its thrilling to be close enough to feel the heat of a Giraffes breath! It's not a cheap family day out, but if you are able to come back, annual tickets are better value. My advice, go early and spend the whole day, get value from the tickets, you won't be disappointed."

It was a nice treat, and fun to see so many animals. The zoo was wide spread and it was enjoyable to walk the grounds. We got there early, so it wasn't very crowded. Everything was very clean"

            "review": "Typical city zoo. I have been to a few European zoos and this one is good compared to some. It is very easy to walk around and plenty to see. I think there is probably too much packed into the space they have. I thought most of the animals looked happy enough and were interacting with people so not distressed as a lot of comments have been made. There were very small enclosures for some of the larger animals especially the lions, there wasn't enough space for them to run about or have there own space, 4 in a very small enclosures. The male lion appeared to be staring out at something for long time but now I guess he may have just been plain bored as little to occupy them.The overall zoo was very clean, facilities were very good for the visitors with plenty of places to eat or green area to sit with your own picnic. I'm not normally a fan of aquariums but thought this one was well worth the visit, the living corals were beautiful as we're the fish.The grounds and gardens were also well kept. Some of the smaller animals had plenty of space to run free and seemed very happy but I am unsure how they are going to establish big enough enclosures for the large animals. The entrance fee is about right for the zoo, we spent over 3 hours wandering about and didn't visit the reptiles house and some other areas."

There are some fantastic exhibits where the animals are free to wonder, like the sloth and lemur exhibits. Take you own food in and have a picnic on the lawns or gardens, or buy some there. There are new exhibits or the elephants and jaguars under construction which I would revisit to see. Very enjoyable. The map supplied isnt up to date so be aware if you are looking for a certain exhibit."

This was the first zoo in Europe I have gone too, and I enjoyed the blend of a carryover as this zoo has transformed exhibits to wonderful living exhibits of habitat, yet retained some of the classic buildings from the zoos early days. The accents and the zoo themed building reliefs on the buildings are classic and are an enjoyment simply for the art of the craft.The zoo is extensive, hosting animals from all over the globe in an enjoyable grounds with wandering paths and well placed areas to rest, snack, and/or simply enjoy a spot for shared conversation or simply meditating on everything around you.The grounds also house an Victorian style aquarium done in the classic Greek style. The exhibits for the aquarium are not huge, though there is plenty to enjoy - about two hours. But do not fail to appreciate the building, its lines and shape, and classic craftsmanship that we seem so pressed to produce nowadays.Great day for family, kids, couple, alone, but I have always loved the zoo so admit my bias."

The primate house and bird areas have no enclosures. The animals are right there. They come to look at you. It has an aquarium and multiple reasonable food choices. We stayed several hours. It's easily accessible from the tram."

These elephants had a poor enclosure, limited space. The zoo it's self was ok. It's a city zoo. So... expect to see just that. It's not a safari park. The cages were small. The sea lions tank was dirty. The apes appeared happy and relaxed. Hardly any staff on hand and limited information given to the public about the animals on display. It was a rainy Monday, few Schools visiting, nice experience but poor show for the animals. However, there was a huge renovation being developed which indicated more space for the poor lions which was welcoming. "

You can take food and drink and sit on the grass if it's nice and have some lunch it's a great afternoon out and I would recommend anyone to go!

Outside enclosures include camels, ox, pelicans, lions, wolves, vultures, giraffes, zebra, emu, gazelles, penguins, primates, racoon and many many more animals, mainly very photographically accessible and looking very relaxed and comfortable in the reconstruction of their particular environment. Their are indoor pavilions where you can wander among birds, squirrels and lizards freely roaming in their beautifully recreated habitat, offering some dramatic photography opportunities. The watchful eye of staff in the unrestrained exhibits ensures that interaction remains safe and kid-friendly Staff are very qualified and responsive to questions. The aquarium building is architecturally impressive and the exhibits inside quite amazing. The light is very low and the echoing acoustics seemed to encourage some unnecessary noise making by the species on the viewing side of the glass.A half a day (without rain) is needed to cover Artis. With a pair of comfortable walking shoes you won't notice the time go by. You can take a break at the zoo cafe, De Twee Cheetahs, overlooking on one side a very picturesque stretch of the Amstel lined with old barges and, on the other side, an enclosure including zebra, emu and giraffe. The most rewarding part of the experience is the reassurance that the welfare of all the inhabitants is so obviously considered and supported with professional and specialised care."

It was very easy to get to although we walked from dam square without realising a tram stops right outside (get the tram!).We spent about 4/5 hours here and although it was drizzling most of the day we had a great time. This was the best activity we did in Amsterdam and highly recommend it to all! A new exhibition had opened that week where you can walk through an enclosure of wallabies/small kangaroos. The zoo was still testing this out and I thought it was great being able to get up close to the animals (although we didn't touch them). They were also in the process of building a jaguar enclosure which looked so good, we will definitely be back to see this next time we visit Amsterdam. There was a nice cafe right by the entrance and clean toilets, great for sheltering from the rain, fairly expensive but who cares.Overall a great day out for families, couples and friends."

We combined our tickets with a canal cruise, which cost \u20ac13, instead of \u20ac16.We arrived at the zoo around 1.30pm in the pouring rain, expecting it to be empty. There was no queue but there were plenty of other crazy people visiting in the rain. 1st stop was the zoo shop to buy ponchos \u20ac3.50 each (you can buy cheaper ones at the Van Gogh museum shop) or pay more in some of the souvenir shops in town (\u20ac5). The zoo itself is lovely, however, I did feel that some of the enclosures are very small, particularly the camels, lions, elephants & gorillas. We did enjoy our visit tho, and there are plenty of places that you can hide away from the rain - butterfly house, insectarium, planetarium, aquarium, monkey house, bird house & reptile house. The highlight for me was seeing the baby gorilla. We did not eat at the zoo, as the cafe attached to the butterfly house closed around 4pm, which was strange, as the zoo was open until 6pm. This was only one of the food places, not sure about the others. However, as most people had just enjoyed the Sea lion keeper talk & were sheltering here from the rain, it would have been good to have it open.Make sure that you get a map, we went directly to the person in the gate, as we already had our tickets, we weren't offered one & did miss seeing some of the animals.

Definitely 100% go and see the animals, so easy to get to..bus or tram, you'll be amazed with the variety of animals and the freedom some of them have (for instance walking with certain ones) just go and check it out!!"

A great selection of animals large and small and everything in between. There is a beautiful butterfly house which must not be missed together with an interesting aquarium which almost doubles as a museum. All of the animals looked very well cared for as was the whole surroundings with lovely flower beds dotted about and loads of benches to sit and enjoy the animals. Undoubtedly, the highlight for me was the gorillas. It was a privilege to witness the tight family bond between them all and an added bonus was a five month old baby. The eating facilities are good and there is the obligatory shop. Definitely a must if you are visiting Amsterdam and you like animals."

The animals are clearly looked after with environments made especially for them, eg the forest and bird houses were unique as was the mountain goat exhibit. I can't wait to come back for the likes of jaguars! The layout was amazing and maps were simple. The aquarium is AMAZING, huge building and very interesting. FOOD AND TOILETSThere are only really two main eateries and they are lacking one in the lower end of the zoo, but all in all one can't complain because the food is healthy and scrumptious! Toilets are dotted about everywhere, so no fear! GIFTSHOP Was a little small and the customer service wasn't great with only one girl on till, with a queue of 10+, who didn't seem to have a clue what she was doing. That won't stop me from giving it 5*!"

Lion enclosure was a highlight for me seeing such beautiful animals from up close. Spent almost 3 hours there with plenty to see. The area outside is lovely with plenty of restaurants and cafes surrounding the zoo to go to before heading back into the city!"

It was kind of sad to see.. But I guess that's hard to see in all zoos! Highlight for sure was the butterfly place.

Entry cost is \u20ac20.50 for an adult, plus an additional \u20ac2.00 if you want a paper map of the zoo\u2019s layout.The zoo is a small one, but easy to walk around on the well-maintained paths. The garden beds at the time of my visit were filled with lovely Spring flowers.From a landscaping point of view some of the exhibits were a bit ordinary. For example the first exhibit a visitor sees consists of Bactrian Camels, a couple of Watusi cattle, a solitary Reindeer and some donkeys all standing rather forlornly on sandy-looking bare earth. There were, however, some great surprises: South American Giant Anteaters and the seldom seen Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s Zebra were just two of these.The best exhibits, however, are those kept behind glass, probably as much for their own protection as that as that of their badly-behaved human onlookers. I witnessed several kids banging on the glass while their parents gazed at them indulgently. Meanwhile, outside, other kids were ripping leaves off a camellia and then standing on a fence throwing them at a group of Sulawesi Crested Macaques. Their parents did nothing to prevent this behavior.The best part of the glassed exhibits included the Gorilla family, the excellent aquarium, the reptile house and the small animal exhibit.The Butterfly house was really good, consisting of hundreds of free-flying butterflies in a humid, tropical atmosphere with plenty of warm climate plants. It was a significant challenge to capture photos of the butterflies as they were flying, rather than resting, the majority of the time.Although I didn\u2019t use any of them there were half a dozen food outlets at the zoo. They seemed to be well patronized.The entry price was rather steep, but I enjoyed my zoo visit and would recommend it."

Except for when you reach the savannah, which looks over some houses. Pretty amazing for the people living there. Who can actually say they have a zebra in their backyard? The parc itself is OK, nothing special, looking like a average Zoo. Although they have a pretty cool theatre featuring a movie about the planet. And a exhibition called: Micropia. The animal cages could use some enhancements, especially the cages from the cat-type animals. I don't know the correct word for that. Also the snake aquarium is pretty sad. As if a snake is always rolled up like that. It needs space, and a lot of it. Wake up, Amsterdam Artis. The food and drinks (think of fries, sandwiches, fried snacks) are a bit expensive, comparable to most of the touristic places in Amsterdam. So better bring your lunch package with you. "

It can be easily accessed by tram, jump on the number 9 from outside the Central Station and jump off at Artis. It's 20.50 Euros per adult, plus 2 Euros a map [just download onto your phone instead].We've visited many zoos and I'd say this is deceptively larger than others, especially considering its city centre location. You could circuit it in 3 hours, or take all day as there is lots to see. The exhibits closest to the entrance were packed with groups of children. We were surrounded by very noisy uncontrolled kids, pushing past us to get a view of seemingly anything we looked at. They then lost interest very quickly, as such were their teachers who thought nothing of their pupils picking sand out of the drain! I see other reviewers had a similar experience.It quietened later and we took a leisurely stroll around the aquarium, large and small mammals, insects, birds... There's something lacking though, there's no energy, maybe down to minimal staff presence. We couldn't put our finger on it!?What's strange is some of the enclosures are lovingly made and the animals seem content. Then in other areas, enclosures looked shabby with no imagination e.g. the seals were contained in an old bowl-like pool. The gorillas were extremely active at feeding time. The silverback is huge, but seemed distressed, running around and skidding in the indoor enclosure. The younger ones were beating their chests and bashing the windows. Perhaps this is normal, but it saddened me!In summary, families with kids will love the huge play area and may see through the dullness of some enclosures. I'm pleased to tick it off my list. But won't be returning anytime soon."

Visited artis zoo on a sunny afternoon in earley September and what can I say apart from wow!I currently live 1 mile from the number 1 zoo in the uk and have family who work there so I visit regularly and Dident think anything could compare to it but I was wrong!Artis zoo is absaloutly fantastic The lay out is brilliant the selection of animals is brilliant the enclosures are brilliant!1000% worth a visit for young or old!Don't forget to check out the white building on the left of the zoo where you step inside the enclosure with a range of monkeys sloths and lizards all running freeYou can get real close to them and get some real good photos!Definately visit again!!!"

Having seen other reviews and talk of the size of the zoo I'd say we were both rather underwhelmed by it all. The zoo itself is indeed of a good size and has a decent layout with animals in large enough and interesting enclosures. The animals were varied enough and the aquarium was not at all bad as part of a zoo. However, there wasn't any 'wow' factor of anything unique and different from so many other zoos we've been to. There was some mention of conservation but nothing significant enough for my liking. We also resented having to pay extra for a map of the zoo, so instead just downloaded a map from their own websiteWhat really did spoil our journey around the first half of the zoo were the visiting parties of children. I'm not sure if it was a particularly bad day or a full moon but the children were rotten and so poorly behaved; children tried to barge in front when viewing, they were sat on the information boards in the aquarium playing with toys and not looking at the animals and we saw one child throwing clumps of wet sand at ducklings with nobody supervising."

He seemed to enjoy his job and when a number of people who had been watching him, asked him questions, he answered and conversed further with those who wanted to know yet more."

A big sign or something at the tram stop would be nice!Anyway, we had a really nice time. There is a really good selection of animals to view and the whole zoo is set up like a park. There are areas of construction, but that didn't take away from our enjoyment.I am generally not a fan of zoos and believe that animals should be left in the wild. That being said, I felt that they actually try to treat the animals as well as they can.But if you decide to go, get there early. When we arrived there was already a huge line and we had to wait about 35-40 minutes to get in."

It is not the largest zoo in the world, but it is well situated and planned out and their collection has it all, including a nice little aquarium. Usually when you visit a zoo, a food rating is not possible because the food pretty much sucks. Not at Artis, in addition to having a place to eat right by the main entrance, there is also a new modern building by the zebras and giraffes in the back that serves some rather good food and beer. You can sit inside, or outside and enjoy your meal. I'm not at all surprised by the rating here, it is well deserved. I wish someone from my local zoo would travel here to see this, they could learn a lot from this place."

I would have thought that the map would be included for that price! I just meandered my way through the zoo. There is at the very least an hour of walking just to see everything. The parts I enjoyed most were the lions, elephants and WOLVES! It had all sorts of animals including myself.Some of the displays were needlessly underwhelming which I found to be disappointing. It was a shame to see some intelligent creatures in cages no matter how well looked after. But there isn't much option to see these animals otherwise. I hope the zoo sponsors wildlife around the world from its profits. Even while it is expensive for the individual and moreso for a family I would recommend the experience for everyone."

The zoo its self it so beautiful with lovely gardens and pathways. It seems huge and i'm sure we probably didn't see everything. there is options to get refreshments and something to eat and i would say that it was wide in choice and very nice also reasonable. there is a huge park for the children too.the second time we went we were in the car and were able to park just outside the zoo free of charge. However the boys liked the trams better ( again the cost covered with the I Amsterdam card)couldn't fault it and would defiantly return to Amsterdam and the zoo with the children."

We got there at 11.30 and there wasn't much of a queue but we left around 2.30 and there was a much bigger queue so go early. You could easily spend an entire day there in good weather as there are lots of areas to sit and enjoy the sun."

You can see different types of birds, animals like lion, reindeer, red pandas, giraffes, chimpanzees etc. Penguins watch and sea lion shows are good. It's a relaxing place with lovely old trees and benches to sit. There is also a small farm where children can pet calves and hen. You must visit if you have kids with you"

The staff all spoke good English and were friendly to help, the price was a little on the steep side but then so is the all the city attractions. The range of of animals is astounding, it's like a zoo/aquarium/natural animal history museum all in one! One downfall I will have to point out is that some of the larger animals have a rather small enclosure compared to most other British zoo's especially the lions, beware though, the gorilla house absolutely pongs!! All in all, it was a great day out and would happily go again when I visit Amsterdam next."

The neo classicism architecture creates a quaint atmosphere, ideal for a half day activity. The zoo is centrally located, two tramstops from Rembrandtplein (line 9) and has a small selection of our favorite wild life animals. Cesar the king lion and his three females (two are his daughters) live close to the entrance. Don't visit them on Thursdays as it is their lazy day since they aren't being fed on those days. Wild dogs, giraffes, elephants are amongst Artis inhabitants. The insectarium, the aquarium, the butterfly garden, the indoor small animal area and the reptile house make Artis ideal for rainy days.There's a small children's farm and a playground as well.Artis is small, but cosy and educational.

First impressions were of the camels, buffalo, reindeer & others all squashed into a small patch of land. They all seemed to get along but was strange to see.Couldn't get over the open aviary with the herons flapping around like pterodactyls and the pelicans. The reptile house was extraordinary, had never seen a snake-headed turtle, komodo dragons, snapping turtle or a crocodile in real life before, although the croc didn't have a sufficient enclosure. The lions who were great to see up close, were in a very small enclosure and sounded distressed. They came out eating chickens as well almost like they were performing for us which made me sad. The caf\u00e9 overlooking the giraffe enclosure is fantastic. The range of food is extensive and reasonably priced. Only zoo I've been to that sells alcohol. Had my first cone of chips here too. The butterfly farm was extraordinary like a taste of Costa Rica. We were fortunate to get a great day weather wise and it was busy enough for a Tues. I would recommend this to travellers."

Although it's located in the very center of Amsterdam, the territory is pretty big - may be even too big for a single visit.

There is a number of pavilions where you can go inside and observe some species without any barrier.Afterwards you can arrange a picnic at the riverside next to the zoo.

It is not too small or too big, fair size to be in the middle of the city. It took us 3hs to walk it all. There's a couple of places you can have a snack or a proper meal at. I have to say it was not too bad for a zoo restaurant either (including children's menus). There was also a children's playground next to the restaurant. When it comes to animals, the fish area was very interesting, the sea lions were gorgeous and so was the butterflies' house. Loved the fact that they were in open spaces and you could almost touch them and in some cases, they were wandering around you. Our daughter loved it.There is toilets easily accesible and they have small pushchairs for children if you don't have one and your child gets tired. Overall a great fun day with kids."

I'm always a little nervous about zoos in this day and age, whilst I realise they play their part in breeding projects it still makes me feel sad that we have the need for such places. With a 13 year old I do try to keep an open mind but Artis didn't make me feel any differently. Although they are doing a lot of work here to improve the enclosures I didn't like the elephants in a small space or the small enclosure for the lion/tigers. The butterfly house on the other hand is lovely. Be prepared for school children on day visits too that didn't seem to be accompanied by an adult but were left to run about, at one point I watched a young man lean over a barrier and put his hand through the enclosure for the wolves, had the beautiful wolf watching him decided it was lunchtime I know who's side I would have been on!

Our worst experience was visiting the Beijing zoo where even the pandas looked miserable.Artis has well designed enclosures and really go out of their way to look after their animals.The park is big with many interesting species from all around the world. We were particularly captivated by the lemurs area. They are not kept in an enclosure but rather an area where you encounter the lemurs as you walk along. We were told that they stay in this one place because they feel comfortable there. You can get close enough to almost pat them!Their giraffe breeding program is a great success and it was delightful for the young children to see so many baby giraffes.All in all an interesting and fun day in the heart of Amsterdam."

All the exhibits are very open and you feel vey close to the animals. We walked into the aviary expecting birds, but we found a tropical house with monkeys swinging just over our heads, bats stretching their wings, a very large iguana scattering along a brand just overhead and shrews running right in front of us. Even the Sloth was moving about. The animal information was in English and other languages. Zookeepers were also in the rooms to help with more info. We spent a lot of time in just this room taking in everything. It was also nice and warm in there for a cold day outside. You can walk right up to the Lemurs. The new Jaguar exhibit looks like it will be really great. We walked amongst the wolves who were singing for each other in between chewing on their dinner bones. And there was a large play area for kids to climb and play outside the cafeteria style restaurant. We didn't even see all the exhibits. We were lucky to be there around 3 pm which seemed to be feeding time so the animals were very active. If you are traveling with kids, I recommend the Artis."

Having come from Colchester where we also have an amazing zoo, I have to say it's a very close contest between them. I would 100% recommend this to anyone!

Animals all seemed happy, I thought maybe a couple of the enclosures were a tad too small but I'm no zoo animal expert! The butterfly house was absolutely beautiful too ! With a nice little cafe in it where you can look over the whole butterfly house ! Defiantly recommend for couples and family's !"

Camels where very dirty looking and scruffy. We walked around to the reptile house where there was a full size crocodile/alligator in a pool no bigger than double its body length, absolutely shocking. Outside the reptile house we had the unfortunate experience of seeing the lion enclosure. 4 lions in a tiny corner surrounded by water, they never moved the whole time we was watching. Clearly unhappy and maybe looking depressed? These cats should be running round playing and excersizing.We then got to the sea lions stayed for 5/10 minutes but had to walk away as it was too sad. Four sea lions in a tiny pool the poor things just swam from one wall to another the whole time. Two very large elephants also in an enclosure that is far too small surrounded by water.We also witnessed 8/9 Silverback Gorillas in a small cage which would be suitable for around 3 Chimpanzees!!!! Looking very depressed.All in all this place good be great, like Amsterdam City. It needs expanding or relocating, those animals need sufficient space to live. Such a shame, Sort it out ARTIS AMSTERDAM ZOO!!"

A nice cafe beside the planetarium where we had a lovely lunch. Butterfly house is a must see along with a small house that has little monkeys and lizards right in view. Reptile house had lots of variety of really cool animals and the aquarium was out of this world!! Lemur enclosure had a little door so the lemurs can roam around as they see fit and if the CHOOSE to touch you- lucky you! Some of the other animals are within a reachable distance but your not supposed to touch the animals (obviously). It's lovely to have that little bit of freedom to see them with a fence.The only downfalls were the very very small lion, elephant and gorilla enclosures.At the moment renovations are being made to new exhibitiona and there is some sort of fundraising going on to purchase a proposed car park for a new elephant enclosure. For now though...Gorillas only had access it seemed to an indoor house and all looked very depressed but looked healthy and we'll cared for.

I thought city zoo meant tiny enclosures and I'm so glad I decided to give it a chance! All of the animals have plenty of room and all seem perfectly content with life in the zoo. Didn't see much staff so it was quite nice that way, almost like they take more of a backseat approach. Not sure if that's the case but it was nice to see a zoo without keepers constantly pestering the animals to be in view for customers. There are so many different areas and you could easily spend all day here, although, the food areas we found were crowded, and I imagine quite expensive.I would make a point of visiting the aquarium which is in a building in the middle of the zoo. There's a walk through building too where you are literally surrounded by animals; bats, sloths, and small monkeys and lizards. It's amazing and there are keepers in the room with the animals who will happily explain what all of the animals are etc! And, there's an insect house too with the usual creepie crawlies with lots of interactive bits for kids.I could go on for days about how wonderful it was and how much there was to see.Entry to the zoo was around \u20ac16.50 for an adult, although when we got to the queue a few friendly locals offered us supermarket coupons which meant we could get in for free. It was my birthday the day we went so it was a lovely bonus. One of my favourite things about Amsterdam are the wonderful local people. Always so welcoming and happy to help. I loved this zoo so much and would happily visit every time I visit Amsterdam!"

There was one animal in a cage that was trying to pull up the drain cover that was in there and was generally pacing around looking quite agitated. Another concerning sight was a large bird walking around it's cage with a dead mouse that it seemed perplexed as to what to do with (it was definitely not it's normal food!). I don't wish to be completely negative about the place, as the butterfly enclosure was fascinating to be in and the member of staff inside was very informative about the different species.

No sign of several animals you might expect to see in a large zoo - big cats (apart from a three lions in a far too small enclosure), hippos, rhinos, most deer species... On the other hand, you might rejoice that such creatures are not being confined in a zoo. Best part for me was the large/wading bird compound/lake. Presumably built for the pelicans, but several wild herons, egrets and storks have taken up residence in the surrounding trees as well, to make the most of the free food!"

I particularly liked the tropical area where various animals were freely walking about or chilling in the trees. There is lots of information about habitats etc, and all the animals look really well cared for. Although there was quite a lot of construction going on during our visit, it looked close to completion and didn't spoil the visit. I will definitely be going back to see it when it's all finished.

There was a lot of construction work, which isn't a problem but they should avoid letting the construction dirt and dust get everywhere by getting street cleaners out. We enjoyed the Penguins, sea lions, wild dogs, lions, gorillas and of course the small mammal enclosure.Well prices but it's a shame the micro-zoo was so expensive."

If the weather is nice I would recommend this zoo as there is plenty to see with a good range of different animals and species. You can pay \u20ac2 extra for a map, but all the proceeds go towards building the elephants a bigger and better shelter which is definitely worth it. This is a very spacious zoo so I do feel that some of the animals, such as the lions and giraffes, could of had much more room to roam. The park is currently under construction though so I hope this is an issue that is being addressed. Overall, a very good day out, but is definitely weather dependant."

The attraction does not offer a free map, but you can purchase one at the kiosk with your ticket for \u20ac2, but it is not essential. It was a disappointment to see the majority of exhibits being in progress to be built and the zoo fishing for funding from the public for the elephant habitat. The aquarium does not have many species, which dampened our experience. I'd recommend people visiting on a sunny day as the animals are friendly (especially in the petting zoo) and they are not by any means camera shy (unless they are eating)."

It was nice to be able to see the animals at eye level without many fences (they use moats to prevent the animals getting too close) we spent a good few hours here, and could have spent longer but we didn't have much time left in Amsterdam after this.My own personal concern is that the animals (especially the lions) didn't seem to have much of an outside enclosure to run around in, compared to the Yorkshire Wildlife park (when the 13 lions arrived here, they had 1 acre each) I know space is an issue, but it was nice to see the expansion works, so maybe there is something in the pipeline to give the big cats some more space."

It feels spacious but at times certain bit seemed hidden away.A zoo is a zoo is a zoo in some ways and a lot of them are doing the same as ones elsewhere but with a different order but I quite liked Artis. It initially felt very enclosed but actually it was more just the layout of the place. The animals have plenty of space to live and the place seemed well kept and looked after.Had the opportunity to see the sealions being fed which was a fun if slightly wet affair as well as get to see some penguins which my wife loves.If you like such places then go, you won't be disappointed."

Unlike English zoo's you can get really close to the animals which is great for photographs, there are also a large variety of different animals and an aquarium so you don't get bored! The only concerns we had were that on walking past the lion enclosure the male lion was clawing at the door trying to get back inside as the lions had been shut outside, they had been shut out so the zoo keeper could do a talk, the talk was in dutch so I'm not sure what they were saying but it seemed a bit unfair that the lions clearly wanted to get back in but were being kept out. Other than that the visit was very enjoyable."

The inside enclosure of the little monkeys, where you are literally a foot away from them, is definitely one of the best parts. The lions are great too, they are not inside any sort of barrier apart from a small stream and a wall, which is again incredible! The giraffe's and elephants are also gorgeous and given a lot of space to live/socialise in, which is always good about a zoo. Overall, would recommend to people who are visiting Amsterdam (it is just a short walk from Waterlooplein Metro Station if you need directions!) and is definitely worth the \u20ac20 entry price."

Some of the the monkeys only had a stone climbing frame in the middle of a busy path surrounded by water which didn't give them much space to move around in. The zoo did look like it was making new enclosures though which hopefully will provide the animals with more space! Overall quite a disappointing trip."

We managed to catch the lion feeding which is definitely worth a watch. The grounds of the zoo are also lovely to look around and the zoo is very well kept! For a small price of 2 euros you can purchase a map of the zoo which makes things easier to find and the cost goes towards the building of the new elephant enclosure. Although there is some construction this didn't ruin the day at all as still plenty to see."

The lions were on a tiny patch of dirt surrounded by water, the elephants were clearly distressed and trying to go back inside (the large metal doors had been closed to keep them in their tiny outdoor enclosure), and the primates were in small cages with very little room. All of this wasn't helped by the behaviour of the visitors - everywhere I went there seemed to be groups of kids (and sometimes adults) banging on the walls of the cages and shouting at the animals to try to get a reaction. This place should be shut down - I honestly don't understand how it has such a good rating on here."

The Forest House, where you walk through a glass house with Marmosets and iguanas roaming freely around as you wander, as well as the lemurs who are happy to pose outside next to you, really added to the excitement. The 2 cheetahs restaurant was surprisingly good value and the toasties were tasty and made to order. There is also a new children's adventure playground which was a big hit. Some of the buildings are of architectural interest and all of the animals looked well cared for and there were quite a few baby animals around, which was a treat! There is some construction work going on at the moment, so no jaguars at the moment (but the lions were v impressive!) but that didn't detract from our enjoyment. Would highly recommend a visit. It is close to the Resistance Museum, Micropia and Botanic gardens if you want to visit 3 more great attractions in the same area!"

You're able to get up close and personal with the animals. instead of cages, most enclosures just have a moat and wall separating the animals from visitors so it feels a lot more natural. Then there's the monkey house with monkeys jumping about above your head and alligators chilling a few feet away from you. And the best bit is the lemurs. They roam free. It was so sunny when we went and they were just lounging about sunbathing beside us. Perfect trip for anybody visiting Amsterdam, families, couples, mates, anyone.

The Planetarium is not worth going to unless you understand Dutch as this is the only language that the show is available in. The high points for us were the Butterfly Pavilion, the Sea Lions, The African Hunting Dogs & the Penguins. Overall this Zoo is not the best one we have ever been to but is okay for a day out if you don't expect too much."

Another visitor complained and was simply told it closes earlier to allow staff time to clean the floors. Again we were not advised of this, had we known this we would have tackled the aquarium first. Visitors should be warned of this to allow them to take this into account.

As soon as we entered the zoo we noticed how much maintenance was going on, with over half the animals not on display due to their enclosures being renovated. In my opinion the Zoo should be closed at this time of year if they want to close off half the zoo to do refurbishments as it was a waste of money. We weren't able to see any of the main animal attractions (Lions/elephants) which was disappointing. Staff in the cafe were very rude and unhelpful. Probably a better place to visit in the summer when all the attractions are open."

Rather, they have motes around their 'enclosures' and it feels more wild, I guess you could say. The butterfly house was the biggest, coolest and most exhilarating one of its kind that I have been to anywhere. I loved it. I could have stayed there all day. Everything was really clean and the employees were all really nice. $20 per person was a bit more than I've paid anywhere else to get into a zoo, but it was worth it. Also, if you get the 'I AMSTERDAM' card, you get in here for free. It's interesting that this amazing zoo is in the middle of the city. You don't feel like it. And I can't wait to come back for the 'big cat' (cheetah?) exhibit they are building."

There was a really smelly indoor enclosure where you see squirrels and little monkeys and they may jump on you, but didn't stay long as the smell made me want to be sick. The aquarium is in the most amazing building, so beautiful. There is also some pieces there which are more like museum items & a giant whale skeleton. Lots of good things to see here. Didn't eat so can't comment on the food. The gift shop was lacking a little. Good price for what you get to see and the time you will spend here. I must have been there approximately 3 hours.

In typical dutch fashion the Zoo is constantly changed and renovated.I hope the \"metzelaarkas\" tropical hothouse will open again after years of closure.Even on a dull january day ARTIS still is interesting with it,s aquarium and butterfly garden were winter seems more colorful.The wisent buffalo enclosure will be made into a wallabi-kangarou area.A new spacious jaguar cage has been build.The old 19th century large cat cages have been demolished and a large new area for asian elephants will be build here.But enough space is still left as it is."

It is very much a traditional zoo, which is currently being expanded to accommodate the animals better. Highlights were the lions, elephants and the sea-lions - whilst many other animals proved very interesting and watchable. I must admit the insect house was a little \"find the exhibit\" due to natures way of camouflaging - but even this was fun. The zoo was not busy on the day and we had a very reasonable and tasty meal in the cafe. A very good day out in all, but not in my top ten places to visit in Amsterdam."

It is in quite a strange location, not where you would normally expect a zoo to be and the entrance was not very well signposted (unless we were just being a bit thick) However, the zoo itself was clean and tidy, or as much as it could be in the pouring rain in the middle of winter.....The animals looked to be well cared for and there was signs of improvement going on right around the zoo - building new enclosures for various animals. The reptile house was fab, not to mention a welcome break from the rain, as was the aquarium. All in all, I enjoyed our visit, even though it didn't stop raining, but hey ho, us Brits are used to that!!"

Like Berlin zoo it is very surreal to hear elephants and lions in the middle of the city but we enjoyed it very much. Due to the fact we bought an Iamsterdam card we got into the zoo free as well as their exhibition Micropia (which was also very good). "

We thought it was going to be quite small and were amazed at the size of the place. There was an aquarium, monkey house and numerous animal enclosures. The zoo is laid out in such a way that it looks very attractive and we wished we had more time there as we could not get to see everything. The cost was approx \u00a315 per person when we went in January 2016 but you could pay extra for a map and to enter the micro exhibits. Definitely worth a visit if you want a leisurely stroll away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas."

The cafe offered a wide variety of cheeses and lovely coffee.

Appearance from the outside makes it seem small but don't be fooled as there is lots to see and do! As previous reviews have mentioned you can get quite close to animals. However, the zoo seems very dated in parts and some of the enclosures (in particular I remember the wolves and the lions enclosures) were clearly far too small for such magnificent creatures. Additionally some of the cages had clearly not been cleaned in a while and really did smell so awful I could not go near them. The staff there were lovely and lots of them are around to give you information and point you towards where you wanted to go next. I would suggest going in the morning as there were no queues and lots of the animals were being fed which was interesting to see. It is good value for money but I just hope they do something to improve the spaces for some of the larger animals. Oh and I saw a baby giraffe which was adorable so kudos to the zoo for their successful breeding programme!!"

Also, if I remember correctly, you can go straight to the entrance and they will accept the HollandPass tickets - no need to use them to get an actual zoo ticket (we probably wasted 20 mins in line). This zoo is a bit different in that you can get really quite close up to some of the animals.

It is well worth it as you get to walk through open air exhibits and see some animals right up close. The butterfly exhibit is amazing. Beware there is some construction going on but it does not, in my opinion hinder the experience! Also there is a touching tribute with flowers to one of their baby elephants who passed away."

You can easily spend all day here, our faves included the red pandas who were really friendly and the cheeky young gorillas.

It has a very remarkable history because during World War 2 it was a place where people could hide from the German's. Today the Zoo has many very beautiful new additions but the most wonderful experience is the Butterfly pavillon. Huge blue and green butterflies fly around your head or come and sit on your shoulder while you walk around in a little jungle. It is a small exotic journey, as if you are in paradise. And don't forget to visit the lovely restaurant De Plantage"

The entry fee is inexpensive and there's plenty to see and do with the family. The butterfly pavilion is a pleasant place and the Aquarium is one of the oldest and best informed in all of Europe. It was even nice to see the local flora and fauna of aquatic life living in the canals of the city exhibit. The zoo portion is reminiscent of the NYC or the DC zoos.

Zoo is large but everything is quite close together with cafes and seating in excess. Also has a planetarium which was an interesting bonus, however the shows are in Dutch so don't expect to understand! Interesting all the same. Favourite part was the beautiful aquarium and zoo history museum; really made us appreciate the age and popularity of the zoo. Must see for anyone in Amsterdam long enough. Would have probably been there all day if it wasn't for the weather but in total we probably spent about 4 hours there including lunch"

Building work going on around the zoo with loud bangs and drilling echoing across the grounds. Some of the most exciting enclosures were having work done on them and this wasn't mentioned when we were handing over our \u20ac40 at the entrance.The most upsetting thing about this zoo was the keeping of some of the animals. The monkeys looked unhappy and bored, the lions had a grey, dull enclosure with a lack of any greenery and the gorillas were laid around in their miniscule enclosure with nothing to play with. Most of the animals looked unkempt and in poor condition. I understand that zoos are for keeping animals but in 2015 I don't believe there is a place for this type of Zoo as a tourist attraction. As a comparison, we visited a zoo in Basel, Switzerland last year which was brilliant."

There's a wide variety of animals, more than the zoo back in Edinburgh and they also have a huge aquarium which I really loved. They have seprate buildings for the chimpanzees, gorillas, insects, reptiles and butterflies which made the experience even better. The one criticism that has to be made was the size of the lion enclosure in particular. There were around 4 lions and they didn't have any running space really which was disappointing.

Although there are a fair number of good enclosures, my general impression was of a preponderance of concrete. I was particularly disappointed by the lion and tiger enclosures - small and cramped, with little tree cover and no real opportunity for the animals to exercise properly. The Japanese snow monkey has been lauded online as cutting edge - I fail to see how a concrete pyramid with virtually no vegetation can be described as such.On a positive note, the great ape and the African plains exhibits are good examples of what can be done if some thought is put into enriching the animals' lives.If people want to visit a good Dutch zoo, I would recommend the Burgers Zoo, near Arnhem, instead."

I always struggle to review zoos, especially as the criteria involved in the rating process goes something like this:-- Lots of animals - check.There was a lot to see which was good and takes a few hours to get through at a steady pace. They have an exotic fish section which was nice to see and provided a nice reprieve from the showers we were walking through whilst outside.I can't remember the Chimps' names, but they put on a good show of play fighting and pelvic thrusting to the crowds watching.The on-site restaurant actually served edible food which was a welcomed change to the usual boil in a bag and microwave crap I have come to expect at zoo caf\u00e9s.Good for a nice walk around with your partner or a young family."

There was a rainforest experience enclosure where you walked through and bats, monkeys, birds, reptiles and sloths had free roam. The restaurants were nice and modern and it was nice to see a variety of animals. There was lots of info provided on the animals too.However some enclosures needed a lot of maintenance. Some were dirty and water needed changing, etc. A lot of the enclosures seemed to small for the animals, especially the lions. That quite upset me as they looked so miserable and the enclosure was tiny for the 4 lions I could see. There were also very few staff seen about and keeper talks are in Dutch, so English speakers be warned. Other than that, a pleasant and interesting experience!"

The camels were covered in their own excrement and shared an enclosure with many species that were not associated with where they are originally from. The sea lions had a tiny pool with no decoration, no vegetation, and it appeared unhygenic. These poor animals were swimming around with no intent and looked extremely upset. Finally, the big cats in general had an enclosure which was completely unsuitable for their size and the amount of excercise that they need. The cheetah which I saw in an enclosure about 20m long and 10m wide was pacing up and down aimlessly. I was horrified by this zoo, the animals looked underwhelmed, hopeless and in some cases insane. Imagine being kept in a cage, not coming into contact with any of your same species. I am disgusted and will never visit a zoo again after this experience."

It is not large with too many animals but you can easily spend there nearly all the day. It was founded in 1836 and this old atmosphere is really ubiquitous in a very positive sense. You really feel like a man discovering Africa, India or New Zeland in 19th century. Artis Zoo is greatly located in a beautiful park with high trees and several cute relaxing zones. All animals are so close that you can nearly touch them. Some are ther even free. They are not afraid at all. Except rather traditional animals like lions, elephants, giraffes, penguins and sea lions, you can see there also plenty of very unique species that can be hardly seen somewhere else such as tiger sharks, white wolves, big antshunters, red pandas, colourful birds from very small places of the world, and so on. Aquarium, insect and butterfly exhibitions are very special too. Last but not least, restaurants and food and drinks there are of a very good quality as well. So, you can relax there and observe your kids playing in nice children playgrounds just next to animals and canal. I very strongly recommend to visit Artis Zoo. Btw it is a very nice 25min (2.5km) walk from the center or central train station."

Why? i don't know - it might be that the relatively small area and its focus on education, rather than grand displays, was the reason. This week I joined my kids to have a look what changed. Well, some of the newer displays were actually very interesting, particularly the Monkey and Bird House, with free-roaming and well-visible bats, sloths, tupajas (tree shrews), a variety of small monkeys and big lizzards, and the Butterfly Pavillion. On the other hand, some enclosures were disappointingly small, like for the African painted dogs, the lions, elephants (which will be expanded soon), and the new savannah ws still looking a bit lost in between the buildings that surround it. Good trip for a long morning visit, and if you want to be up close with species not commonly encountered in other zoos (like Tree porcupine, Asian marten, Anoa, Rock cavy and Gundi)."

The grounds are massive, there were lots of exhibits, and it was fun to just walk around and see what we saw. They had a lot of animals I'd never encountered before and you were very near the animals for most exhibits...it was definitely a \"tourist beware\" environment, as there were several signs placed in multiple languages warning guests not to stick their fingers in. You were THAT close to the animals.My only complaint is that some of the exhibits had a LOT of animals in them. And by that I mean that there just didn't seem to be enough space for everything in the enclosure (namely the giraffes and elephants, though there were signs near the elephant enclosure asking for donations to expand the area)."

Whilst staying in Amsterdam, we decided to take the open top bus tour of the city and we are so glad we did because it allowed us to find this marvellous place!When we first drove past, it seemed to be a small but very welcoming Zoo. However, once we arrived at the Zoo, it soon became apparent that this is a very large Zoo!My two main points for this Zoo are: 1) The value for money is just outstanding!!! 19 Euros for an adult is incredibly cheap once compared to like for like Zoo's in Europe. 2) As mentioned previously, the Zoo is very large and you will need to allow a good part of your day to visit. Other points to consider: 1) The Zoo is very interactive. You get to experience interactions with animals that most other Zoos wouldn't permit. 2) The facilities e.g. Toilets, Shops, Restaurants etc... are of a very high quality. 3) The staff are very welcoming and love to interact with you. 4) BUY A MAP, this place is huge and sometimes it feels like its never going to end! Buy a map so that you don't miss anything. 5) JUST GO!!!You really will enjoy this place, I promise!"

It has a wide variety of animals, birds, reptiles, insects, fish etc to see and is also nice to walk around on a sunny day. Dropped a point off as I felt some of the enclosures were a bit small for the animals (never really thought about this until I saw the Blackfish documentary) but apart from that it is well worth a visit."

Seeing people cry at the lions who lie unmoving in their crowded space. Hearing flamingos scream as they can't leave a small fenced off area overlooking their usual lake. Wondering how a leading city such as Amsterdam could have such a poor zoo.This is how we found our visit. The enclosures for the most part are depressingly small. Animals are clearly distressed at their situation. There is little (almost no) educational value nor, it seems, conservational value to the park - these being the two most important factors to a zoo. Instead we are left with a spectacle - creatures far removed from their natural habitat with no purpose other than to be gawked at. Some elements were better. The Penguins were having a great old time. Penguins always seem to get the most space in any zoo. The butterfly house is also interesting, although still lacks any real educational value. One thing I will say is the ground staff did a great job. The ticket staff were friendly, and the girl we saw cleaning out the enclosures was working very hard. The park is also very clean, suggesting some effort goes into keeping it that way. All in all a sad couple of hours. I only took one picture, attached, and didn't feel like taking more while we tried to make the most of the \u20ac40 entry fee (for 2 adults)."

Most of the exhibits provide ample room for the animals. Access to the animals, especially for photography is incredible. Very few of the exhibits require the visitor to look (or shoot pictures thru) glass. There is a small 'Lemur Island' that has free running red ruffed lemurs walking around. Photo ops are abundant. The butterfly enclosure was fun to walk thru. I have to admit that, after 4 hours, I never got a chance to go to their aquarium. I would very highly recommend this zoo to any animal lover and/or photographer."

Well worth buying the map on your way in for a small donation.The top spot by far is the monkey and bird house, where you get to see all kinds of animals (bats, sloths, lizards, you name it) within touching distance -- no glass here. We got close to lizards bathing in the stream, watched a sloth cross ropes right above our heads, and got swooped by bats. Very cool! Other rooms included bird exhibits where they can come out and walk around you or swoop overhead.The butterfly pavilion was neat, though I would have liked more signage about which butterflies are shown. We also enjoyed the aquarium, with a fascinating and diverse selection of fish, and I loved the viewing bee hive in the insect house.The only disappointment was that the planetarium was booked by a group of school students and we didn't find out until very close to the show start time. Perhaps a sign by the entrance showing which sections are unavailable would be a neat way of communicating this to visitors."

Although the animals seemed physically perfectly healthy, you can't help but question the size/quality of the enclosures/enrichment. Sure, it meant you never failed to get close to the animals - which was great - but I fear they tried to pack too many exhibits into the limited inner-city space, which was surely to the animals' psychological detriment. Our favourite part, however, was the renovated aquarium. There were no awe-inspiring, giant, seemingly ocean-sized tanks like you get in some places, but there were TONNES of them with all the freshwater and marine species of fish, coral, cephalopod, arthropod and weed you could think of.

Only stayed around 15 minutes as couldn't bare to see any more clearly unhappy animals kept in areas far too small and not suited to their needs. Small pens housed seemingly random groups of animals together. Many of the bird species and also the lemurs are allowed to roam free - meaning that children (and adults!) are able to prod, poke and harass them all day. Walked passed the lion cage and there was a very large group of people watching and shouting - turned out this was because the lion was up against the back wall \"attacking\" it, clearly in distress. Saw other animals such as elephants, giraffes, sea-lions, all of whom looked depressed and in areas completely unsuitable. Obviously there are other, much more cruel zoos and animal shows in the world, however I was shocked to see all of this in a modern, western country like the Netherlands. The trip to the zoo was the only downside to an otherwise fantastic trip to Amsterdam. I would not recommend a visit - instead give your money to a well-deserving animal charity who may actually do some good with it."

Most of the zoo is just like any other zoo worldwide with the same kind of animals.This zoo has quite small enclosures with mostly baby animals however there still isn't enough room for the animals to properly move around.However the butterfly enclosure is absolutely stunning! Would recommend going purely for this! Get up close and personal with some of the most spectacular insects with the best colours! Big and small in a large free open enclosure you can walk straight into."

The lion enclosure is heartbreaking and the only thing that stops me being too depressed is the fact a new enclosure is being built for them, not before time. On the flip side the giraffes have a huge open modern enclosure which is a credit to the zoo. I appreciate that as a private enterprise, money is limited but I hope the well advertised changes occur soon. The main reason to recommend a visit is the fact your money will go towards building a better zoo. I look forward to coming back when the animals are all in an enclosure they deserve."

Going to the zoo hadn't been a holiday priority, but I had a spare day and the weather was good. I was pleasantly surprised! It's a large, good quality zoo, with a great range of animals. Even if you've been to bigger zoos in other countries, this one was easily up amongst them for a great experience.It had a good number of indoor tropical houses where you can walk among birds, butterflies and even sloths - that was a highlight! Giraffes were also particularly good, they had a lovely little baby giraffe :) And they had capybaras, which are my favourites! Hooray!A criticism would be that it wasn't very helpful towards international visitors - the map was in Dutch. Most of the labeling in the zoo was available in Dutch and English, but not consistently. There were a few animals where I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at! Also, all the toilets tended to be quite busy and not always entirely pleasant - not awful, but I would have expected better."

Loved seeing the lemurs close up (until one got cross with me, bared its teeth and hissed!). Also got a good look at the giraffes. The butterfly house was a real treat although very hot.There's a couple of areas that need work. The meerkats could do with a bigger enclosure, as could the elephants. Also we didn't have enough time to explore as much as we'd have liked. This is definitely on our list for our next visit but will be better prepared.Really lovely.

We arrived at about 9:15am and there was no queue at all which was great as we went straight in - so I recommend arriving early. The park was fairly large and not too busy. We bought a map on arrival which I also recommend as I didn't notice any maps within the zoo. The restaurant we ate in was a good price - we shared a 2 person platter for less than 10 euros and the food was good quality and staff were friendly. The only reason I'm not rating this 5 overall was due to the poor size of some of the exhibits - the lions in particular had little room. But a very enjoyable day out and great for everyone!"

It's not too big, and it's nicely landscaped. The smaller enclosures are really well laid out. We saw racoons, meerkats, white wolves, mountain goat, okapi several large bird species, including a colony of cormorants. I'm not sure if they were part of the zoo, or had just taken up residence in the pelican lake. My favourites were the vultures.If you don't speak Dutch, it's fun trying to read the names of the animals in Dutch.There are spacious cafes to sit and watch waterbirds swim past, and a gift shop.I wish we'd had longer there. There's places to just sit and rest between the enclosures.My only negative point is ( and it's the same with other zoos) I don't like to see big animals like elephants, lions, camels giraffes, zebras in small enclosures. Having listed these animals, I've just realised how big the selection of them was!I would happily go back there tomorrow!"

I visited with friends, but would gladly spend a day here with my children as I know they would be amazed and fascinated by it.We accessed using our iAmsterdam city card, but I would have happily paid the admission (very reasonable anyway, only \u20ac19,95 for an adult) as it was a great visit and I would go again.The zoo is actually situated in the middle of the city, but you wouldn't know! It's peaceful, tranquil and the air was fresh. The zoo itself is very clean, very well kept and well presented. I thoroughly enjoyed the visit, and all the staff that we encountered were very friendly and knowledgeable. There are so many animals to look at and so many talks to squeeze I to your visit, we didn't get it all done sadly which of course is a great excuse to make a point to re-visit in the future!I can't even begin to start listing all the different types of animals as there was just so much, but my highlight was a secure building where you could walk with the animals being loose and free in there too - monkeys running above your head on the tree branches and sloths sleeping next to where you stand! It was an amazing experience!Loved the visit, will return again!"

We spent about 4-5 hours meandering through the various areas and enjoying the sunshine. Lots of interesting information available about the various species on show and the current breeding programs. The African hunting dogs and red panda were highlights for me. Some of the enclosures seem a little dated and small, but there is development of new enclosures in progress.I recommend the cafe between the canal and the giraffe enclosure for a quieter and more scenic stop - excellent chips and mayonnaise!Overall a lovely day out with plenty to enjoy for all ages."

The Zoo is quite big, so it does take around half a day if not more to get round.

Although a number of sections have been renovated, i could not help but feeling depressed by the size and state of some of the habitats, mainly the big cats.

Plus how good can a zoo be in the very heart of a city?Apparently good enough to go two days in a row. I went with my 5yo son while my wife and 16yo daughter did whatever it is women do when visiting European cities from abroad. We had a phenomenal time and my son begged the gals to go again the next day so he could show them around and see the stuff we were too tired to see the first day.My son was engaged the entire time, asking questions about where the animals were from. Coming from North America, there were a lot of animals I had never seen before and many I had never heard of.There are also nice gardens to stroll through and rest in when you're taking a break. The animal enclosures are (mostly) pretty spacious and allow you to get pretty close."

There is a very good selection of animals to see here especially considering the size of the zoo. The elephants were our highlight. The zoo is a little on the expensive side and is popular attraction for family's, it and had a long queue at the gates when we arrived.

They have accommodated so many species in such a small area, it is to be experienced to believe it. The kids love the many interactive installations that are put up at regular intervals. The small wheel barrows are a hit.We particularly enjoyed the enclosure where in the wild animals were free to roam around along with the visitors. Was quite a novel experience.

            "review": "Lovely zoo, and one of the best ones I've been to in a long time. I like my animals and I like my zoo's (which led to me to 4 years of university study), and I've not been to a zoo in ages, so it was on a trip to Amsterdam where we decided that a trip to the zoo was in order.We arrived bright and early to get in before the queues, however, there were no queues. In fact there was only a handful of people at the zoo the whole day, though I suspect that this might have something to do with the weather...Artis is very easy to get to by tram, and the walk from the tram stop to the zoo takes you by some great looking buildings and architecture. The cost of entry on the door was a shade under \u20ac20 per person, and you can buy a \u20ac2 map, the proceeds of which were going towards a new elephant house.The zoo is large, much larger than I had anticipated, but you should easily be able to see everything over the course of the day. There are the usual zoo stalwarts - lions, kangaroos, monkeys, gorillas, and the like, but also critters that I can't remember seeing at other zoos, though these were mostly reptilian, insecta, and molluscan in nature.While we were in the reptile house (they house a nice selection of snakes and lizards, including some awesome and very active legless lizards) it started to rain. Heavy rain. Torrential rain. Not the zoo's fault, obviously, but we were stuck in the reptile house for a lot longer than we intended (just as well I like reptiles). Once we felt the rain had died down enough, we wanted to run to the next enclosure, but, whilst running, the rain started off again, and we couldn't tell which way to go. Eventually we found a doorway in which to squeeze under just to get out of the rain. Unfortunately, we were stuck there for some 30 minutes whilst trying to work out where we could get to without getting soaking wet. However, the total lack of people outside, the howling wolves, driving rain, and swaying of the trees and vegetation allowed me to play out a \"Jurassic Park\" fantasy (that T. rex almost got us!)Once we could we headed over the sea lions just in time to watch feeding time (it was still drizzling, but the bulk of the rain had dissipated). Although the entire thing was conducted in Dutch (as it should be, being in The Netherlands and all) it was easy enough to follow. Besides, it was great fun watching the sea lions feed - they made a little show of it.Wandering around the zoo we took in chimpanzees, various ungulates, birds (the vultures were particularly gorgeous), elephants, giraffes, and a good many larger mammals.One of the highlights was the butterfly enclosure, full of great looking exotic plants, and, of course, butterflies fluttering around. The butterflies appeared \"tame\" or at least very used to human presence as they didn't scatter when you approached to take pictures. Marvellous.During our time there we took in feeding time with the penguins, gorillas, and red ruffed lemurs. The latter was particularly good as they allow the lemurs to come out of their enclosures to feed. They often jump over you to get to tree branches, and walk by you going you \"the eye\", however, I'm not sure they're tame enough to stroke, and because the whole talk was in Dutch and no one else was reaching out, I thought it was best not to. However, it is amazing to get up close and personal with such awesome creatures.We spent pretty much the whole day there and I believe we saw everything we wanted to. Oh, there is even a museum and planetarium in there which was great. Food wise there is plenty to have and it wasn't too extortionate price wise.In short, Artis is a great day out, most of the animals seem \"happy\", though I did see a wolf limping, but couldn't tell if it was an old injury or recent sustained. The staff are great, very friendly, and always with a cheery \"hello\".Easily one of the better zoo's I've been to."

That said, the zoo is well organised and has a variety of species and lots of staff looking after them. It is much nicer than London zoo and is on a larger site in the middle of the city. It is easy to find. Get the number 9 tram from the centre of town and hop off and cross the street to find the queue. We waited in line for 20 mins but it was made painless by the ice cream from the shop next door.Inside the food plentiful but expensive. There are lots of places to stop and grab a drink or some food but the best is the cafe near the play park at the very back of the zoo.I would come back but I'd take a packed lunch and avoid it altogether on a hot day."

We were impressed by how much there was to see including the Aquarium and the Planetarium. The viewing of the animals was great, but encloseurs could of been cleaner and so could the water. The Elephants actually made me cry. They did't have half of the room they need and deserve, and when we saw the inside closeures, these were very small with no enrichment and the baby couldn't get to his food. Again, the encloseurs were not very clean. One of the elephants in particular was pacing and looked bored and restless. They were offering a small promotion in the shop, to help the elephants get a larger encloseur using some of the car park. It will be interesting to see if they raise enough money to do that. The animals in general looked healthy, although for some, more enrichment to stop them getting bored would be nice to see. The gardens were beautiful and the little parks for the kids were great too. There was a section with free roaming animals, like small monkeys, sloths and lizards were great and they had a huge area to play in while visitors could surround themselves and close up for photos. The staff were on hand to answer any questions and were very friendly. For \u20ac18 the value was great and the zoo was very clean ( apart from most encloseurs). We didn't eat there but we saw the restraunts were big. We went on quite a rainy day but there was enough to see both indoors and out to keep us happy. They offered also a free \"daily news\" with information on public talks, and animal updates. In general a great day out, just needs more attention to animal cleanliness and a better shop"

Lots of animals to see, many more exotic animals then in UK zoo but some of the elosures were just too small. All the enclosures were very well done but just not enough space in some of them for the animals to run around, in particular the lions and elephants. We had food at the cafe towards the back of the park which was good and reasonably priced. All in all a good day out, we were there five hours, but just seems a bit more could be done to make the animals happier rather then the tourists"

We visited the zoo whilst in Amsterdam as my boyfriend has been pestering me for ages to go to the zoo so I thought why not visit a lovely zoo on a sunny day on holiday. We visited the zoo about 12pm and stayed until round 5pm. There are lots of animals to see but also the way it is laid out there are plenty of nice seating areas to stop, relax and absorb the atmosphere. It is very family friendly but also great for couples and friends too. The animals seemed fairly happy, but I did feel they do not have a lot space to roam around. If you like Zoo's then it is worth a visit."

I love going to look at the animals and enjoy the whole experience but I hate seeing animals who look somewhat trapped and not as well looked after as they could be. However this zoo was absolutely beautiful and so were the animals. The animals looked happy and very well looked after. Their enclosures were suitable for their needs, large, well kept, clean and lovely. And the other areas of the zoo were very clean too and all round pretty. It cost me around 19 euros to enter the zoo which I thought was a very good price (I think it was an extra 2 euros for a zoo map which I definitely recommend). The zoo is big but you aren't walking far to find the next animal to look at. I loved the indoor building where you could walk through and there was reptiles and monkeys in the trees/plants around you, it was amazing to see them that close. But I really did love looking at all of the enclosures! There is also wonderful restaurants and cafes within the zoo. There is a seating area next to the flamingos where you can have a drink/something to eat whilst enjoying an amazing view of them! I would definitely recommend wearing comfortable shoes as this is an all day event and definitely bring a camera! Make sure you go inside the aquarium too as walking past all of these sea creatures is an amazing experience.The only complaint I have is that the indoor part of the elephant enclosure was closed and the elephants were trying to get inside, although it would have meant people wouldn't have been able to see the elephants (unless there is a viewing spot inside too?), I would rather them have been happy indoors."

However, I don't think I've ever had to pay for a map of the zoo before. To get a map (on top of the ticket price) you have to pay 2 euros.

They have all your usual zoo animals plus rare and even unheard of (in my case) animals, that all had spacious and clean enclosures, which is always nice to see. There was also a bird Avery and a reptile/butterfly house. We stopped to watch a Sea Lion talk, which although in Dutch was still an amazing thing to watch, and the cafe served a fantastic array of food and drinks, including fresh fruit smoothies on ice!

This is always nice to see that the conditions they live in are good. They have such a range of animals here, and, considering we went here in early March, they were all still out and active. The zoo is mapped out and signposted quite thoroughly and clearly too. The only bad part, the food available is quite expensive and not very varied.

They have lots of animals of different species and at the same time I love their butterfly garden. The butterflies just rests on your hand and you can have a closer look at them.This zoo is also good for wheelchairs, they can easily roam around, there are just some steep downhill in one side of the zoo, but it would be no problem with wheelchairs.

The zoo is a little out of the way - it took us a while to walk there but there is also public transit available. My favorite part of this zoo was that so many of the animals were basically free. For example, the lemur house is a house where the lemurs live, but they can exit the house and walk around in the yard which you are standing in. You're not allowed to touch them and there are staff around, but basically you are right up close with these animals. Several of the monkey exhibits were also very open. This allows you to take better photos than at many other zoos where you are shooting through glass or wires. The zoo is large and will take you a while to get through everything which, in my opinion made it worth the slightly higher price of admission. We also paid an extra 2 euros for a map, but the woman explained that those funds are helping build a better facility for the elephants."

As had free entry to the zoo with our Iamsterdam we decided to pop in after our visit to the Resistance Museum.The zoo was quite well kept and the animals seemd to be adequately housed although there wasn't a large range of animals to view. There is ongoing renovation to make the animal enclosures less cagelike. We did a quick circuit and were entranced by the large collection of pink flamingos that we don't see in Australia.The gardens in the zoo were pretty and well maintained with lots of grassy areas to sit and picnic. From the joy on the faces of the many young visitors there I guess that the zoo is a hit. I'm not sorry that we wandered into Artis Zoo."

There are many options from healthy salads, fruit, sandwiches to less healthy chips and ice cream. Children portions available as well. There are enough inside things to do for when the weather is not so nice, like the aquarium, the butterfly building etc. The big restaurant \"Twee Cheetas\" has a very nice playground and a big terrace.

My wife can not walk long distances, thus we were very appreciative that the zoo provides free wheelchairs at the entrance. This is jot a large zoo in terms of the number of animals, but the layout is easy to manage, birds--both those in confined areas as well as the free roaming visitors--are everywhere. The plantings of flowers throughout were attractive, as well as the beautiful rhodendrens that were in bloom in several places. The zoo is a mixture of old and new. The acquarium is quiet old, but still interesting. The butterfly area and the small mammal facilities are newer and quite well done. We particularly enjoyed the former as there were two very informative volunteers to point out specific species. We ate at a new facility with both inside and outdoor tables. Reasonable priced sandwiches, fries, and very good desserts. Plan to spend 4 hours to thoroughly enjoyed this gem."

It is good to know however that Artis is improving the living spaces of their animals and will not acquire any new species anymore. A minor flaw I found were the feeding presentations. It was not even that crowded but I could not hear the speaker because of the noise of other people and they were very short. You will need a full day visiting this beautiful park."

The fact that the zoo is 175 years old means that the buildings (for example bird house, reptile house etc) are very beautiful and historic. The zoo itself is beautiful to walk through with lots of fountains, waterways and pretty gardens. The staff are really nice and the main restaurant has delicious food.When it comes to the animals, I thought most of the exhibits (elephants, big cats etc) were just way too small. The elephants were seriously depressing, 4 elephants crammed into such a little space. Some other enclosures though like the lemur island and some others were however then again quite decent.So as I was walking through the zoo I really just had mixed feelings all the time. The problem with Artis is that they are in the middle of the city and have no space to expand. They are currently working on a project to give part of the parking lot to the elephants, which I think would be great. Otherwise they just shouldn't have elephants because that enclosure is not decent for them.There are so many beautiful zoos in The Netherlands, I just don't think that Artis sits at the top with Ouwehands, Blijdorp etc."

I liked how many of the animal areas were surrounded by moats and gardens instead of fences and wires. The zoo is quite large for being in the middle of a city and I spent several hours and saw most of the animals. There are also several food stands and a good restaurant next to the entrance that is cafeteria style with lots of good choices. Best of all, admission is included with the Iamsterdam City Card!

From this we planned a whole afternoon there, however it would have been easy to spend a whole day there! The entrance fee was 20 euros each, and an extra 2 euros for a map. Once inside though, everything else was part of the ticket price, e.g. aquarium, butterfly house (and the planetarium although we didn't go in) so we felt that it was good for the price. There was a wide range of animals and exhibits, it felt that some of the there enclosures were slightly small however, we are sure that there was houses at the back for them to go into. It was unlike many zoos in the sense that you could walk around and for some of the enclosures, there were no fences, only a moat of deep water. This meant you could get excellent photos and was a very different experience.They also had an open lemur enclosure, where you could go to stroke them, and take photos close up. This was really cool!There were plenty of benches and places to have a picnic, and you could take in your own food to eat, which meant that it was a very affordable day out...

The encounters with the animals are much more intimate -- I filmed a sloth moving from 3 feet away inside the forest house with no barriers, and got within a foot or two of penguins, monkey of all kinds, etc. The ambiance is wonderful. Right in the city, relaxing and uplifting. Probably my most enjoyable stop in Amsterdam!"

Founded in 1838, this zoo is experienced, well seasoned and takes pride in renewing itself and innovate.Part of renewals and innovations is the current refurbishment, relocation of cages and animals and part of the zoo being inaccessible or bein routed past empty pastures. These are temporary measures, enabling the zoo to grow, innovate and give its animals the housing they need. Bear (pun) with them - slowly but surely it will get its shape and a better zoo will unfold itself. Tickets can be purchased online."

Construction work is still in progress but this did not compromise our enjoyment. Pretty much all the Animals seemed happy in their environments. Of particular note is the reptile house which featured some of the largest false Garials I have ever seen and the Seal display which was very fun and informative for both my teenagers. The herd of Giraffes was surprisingly large and there were a number of young and adolescent animals which I presume had been raised at the Zoo."

Avoid coming there in the weekends, its to busy then.Since I have have a subsciption, I can be found there with a a coffee just enjoying myself. There is a downside however. Some of the cages are very small. Artis is working very hard to make the circumstanses and cages much better, but like all good things it takes time. Still I think its very much worth your while."

It has a great selection of animals including penguins, seals and baboons. Their exhibits to my opinion are world class. they also have a planetarium which I think is great. Watching the animals relaxes you, the only cons I found in this zoo are some of the exhibits which i found relatively small e.j. (elephant enclosure as well as the jaguar's.) Oh lastly, if you purchase an Iamsterdam card the fee is included so there was no entrance fee for me. the card is purchased right out of centraal station."

All of the animals seemed well-fed and contented. We went round twice, The butterfly pavilion was super. The aquarium appeared to be only a small building from the outside was packed with many curious exhibits. Super day out!

Life in all of its wonderful forms showcase their beauty in a small (compared to US zoos) but fantastic locale right in the heart of Amsterdam. Great kids area where parents can enjoy food and drink while watching their children play. Overall a great day- will be back many times over the next couple of months. If you're planning to attend more than 2.5 times in a year buy a season pass."

I visited the Zoo on a trip to Amsterdam with my partner and we were very excited to see the animals and especially the Bears as that is my partners favourite animal. We noticed that many of the cages/enclosures were FAR to small for many of the animals! The birds with massive wing spans could hardly fly in their enclosure. We were more upset that there were no Bears available to see (bears were our main attraction).Overall it's a big zoo with a lot of animals just in the wrong size encloses that isn't fair on them. Definitely needs looking into by the owners...."

When we got there, we had to que for about 5/10 minutes to buy a ticket, we were asked at the ticket office if we wanted to pay extra to go see an exhibition called \"Micropia\", we didn't really know what to expect so we decided to pay extra to go and see the exhibition, the exhibition was basically about germs and what germs lived on what etc. I wouldn't recommend paying extra if I'm completely honest... I found it quite boring!Besides that, the zoo was great, definitely the best zoo that I've been to so far. It was huge, we even got lost a few times! There was so much to see, we were there about 3 hours and a half and I'm pretty sure we missed a few things too. My favourite part was that it had rooms that you could walk into and actually be with the animals. They had a few rooms like this, we went into one which had monkeys, bats and lizards - they had the cutest little monkey in there, they also had a separate room that you could walk into full of butterflies which was nice.I really enjoyed my time here and I definitely think you should give it a visit if your ever in Amsterdam."

What this zoo, in particular, has achieved is a good transition to the 21st Century. It still has a little way to go, but it is certainly moving in the right direction. The only real animal welfare problem not yet solved is adequate accommodation for the elephants, however plans are in place to renovate and enlarge their enclosure. Other than that, this is a very good zoo with lots of animals that seem to be well looked after. The zoo is quite large and remarkably close to the city centre."

Instead of the usual fences, in many places, these guys used a normal 1m high fence and a water moat to separate the animals from the visitors. This allows you to much better see and photograph the animals ! The garden is well organised and for 2Euros you can have a map to guide you through the park. Be sure to visit Amsterdam's objectives using a 2 or 3 day city card as you'll save a lot. For me, the museums visited on a 3day city card + 1day region ticket costing me 79Euro, were worth about 150Euros in museum admission fees and transportation if purchased separately !"

I can't say I was expecting much considering it is not far from the centre of Amsterdam, but fair play it is a beautiful area... until you go in. The first enclosure you see when you enter is the camels/donkeys/alpacas/watusi cows/reindeers all in a small sandy area with very little vegetation to graze on- not exactly a natural setting for any of the species. As we walked around there were so many distressed animals in very inadequate enclosures. For example the lions - 3 females (2 looked overweight) and 1 male (whose spine and ribs were showing) in an enclosure that had more water than land, and not enough land to even run a couple of metres, they could barely muster the energy to move for the 30 minutes we were watching them... something definitely not right there! The bull elephant was kept in a tiny area where he could barely take a couple of steps forward. There was a snake (I can't recall which species off hand) that was trying to shed it's skin but the pool had no water in and an awful lot of poo (which for snakes who poo every 3 weeks or so suggests it hadn't been cleaned for a while!) so was struggling to shed. We saw the chimpanzees showing signs of autocoprophagy (eating their own faeces) in a small 'outdoor enclosure'. Nearly all enclosures were dirty, however we did see the Alpine Ibex being cleaned. Very poor enclosure sizes and unsuitable vegetation/subtrate in general. As a student being trained in the area of animal welfare, I shed tears when walking through the zoo and left feeling drained and upset that in this day and age the animals are being kept in such poor conditions. I for one will not return until there is a very big improvement."

My family (50, 49, 23, 21) went to Artis at about 12:30 and when it closed, we still hadn't managed to get to the raccoons and didn't see the planetarium (went in there just after last show had started).However we love animals and can sit watching various ones for ages, so your mileage might vary.We thought it was one of the best zoos we had been to, and I want to stress the word zoo, not safari park, if you don't want to see animals in captivity then my advice is don't go.All the animals we saw looked very very happy and well looked after. The penguin enclosure looked like it could do with modernizing but they seemed happy.I suppose it all depends on how you look at things. I love all animals and own two dogs and two cats (and a load of fish) .We were watching the hunting dogs (looked a lot like hyenas in my opinion) and they had a fair sized place to run around in, but I could imagine numerous people complaining that they need more space.But I know if my dogs had that space to run around in, they would be in paradise. Sure they get walks every day, sure they go to the beach once a week, but I know they would love to have that pen to run and play around in rather than my garden, and I know they would never want to come in the house if they did, and when you look at it like that, well to me it puts things into perspective.Lions seemed happy, that was the one area in my opinion that could have been bigger, but I think I would always think that in a zoo, but they again seemed very content and happy.With that out of the way :)We had a superb day, we will go again. The inside place with the birds was awesome as were the gorillas.We had one really negative experience. We were hungry, had just gone through the very humid butterfly place and above that was a cafe. It was awful in our opinion (unless it was an off day), a tiny selection of food and drink, coffee tasted rank, neither me or my wife drank ours.Luckily however, we tried another cafe, this time the one near the giraffes and zebras (just over the bridge from them) , this one was superb, like visiting two completely different companies, huge selection of hot and cold food, fresh fruit, ice cream etc, coffee was lovely etc. We nearly didn't bother going in after our earlier experience but we are glad we did.While we didn't eat there, we did look in at the planetarium cafe and it seemed very similar to the one near the giraffes and zebras, so based on our experience, avoid the one at the far side of the zoo near the insects.Not sure what else to say, it's a zoo and it has animals :) Staff were very nice, all happily answered any questions in English and the inside places that had staff, the staff were eager to point out animals we might have missed hiding here and there.We were glad we went."

It's sad when, in my opinion, the cockroaches in the relatively newly built Insect house have better living conditions than the Lions, Wolves and Elephants. The Wolves reside in a very uninspiring enclosure, bland, uninteresting for both the animals and 'spectators', far too small for the group. The Lion enclosure is also far too small for the pride. The whole place looked liked it need a good clean from top to bottom. The outside bird houses were filthy, full of dead and rotting vegetation and stagnant green pools from which they were supposed to drink and bathe. The penguins only had one small pool in which to swim and clean themselves, the other was empty, presumably waiting to be cleaned or repaired. The place seemed desperately understaffed apart from the newly refurbished Monkey House (built around 1910). Here at least the small monkeys could roam around an open environment and visitors could interact (but not touch) with them and the very informative staff. I am surprised at some of the comments saying what a wonderful experience this had been for some visitors. Yes, I am sure it's fun and satisfies curiosity but do they really stop and think about the conditions these animals are living in every day of their lives? We can simply return home after the visit, they are stuck there until they die. I would have loved the opportunity to walk around with a member of staff and give my opinions of the animals and conditions first hand. Maybe they will take me up the challenge. If you are visiting, after photographing or simply gazing at the animals, take a moment to examine the conditions and living spaces afforded to them and make up your own minds. I totally agree with the review \"Sums up all that is wrong with Zoos\". I also saw the 'disturbed' leopard pacing up and down looking clearly distressed and the 'dancing elephant' which wasn't really dancing but displaying behavioural issues. The whole place is FAR TOO SMALL, still stuck in the 1880's when nobody cared about animals but I sincerely thought we had moved on since then? Only the INSECTS didn't seem to worry too much!!"

As others have mentioned when we picked up entry tickets we were asked if we wanted to buy a map of the zoo and money went to help Elephants which we thought a good cause. To see a large bull elephant confined in an enclosure where all it could do was walk a few paces forward and then reverse a few paces back time after time was quite distressing. To follow that with sight a panther pacing round and round its cage clearly in a mentally distressed state was awful. By and large the animals seem to be contained in enclosures far too small and on hard ground. I guess we spent no more than an hour there including a coffee I thought it was was frightful . I am not one of those animal rights people but I honestly wish it were closed down."

We would not have visited it had it not been free and I am relieved I did not pay for this experience. It was quite distressing witnessing some of the animals in this zoo, in particular the elephants. they were kept in tiny spaces, and for some reason were isolated from each other. One was evidently extremely distressed and was pacing the enclosure looking very aggitated and was convulsing and retching over and over :( When we were at the ticket office the admissions staff asked for a voluntary donation to help the elephants which we gladly gave- well, we couldn't see much evidence of this money going to benefit the lives of the elephants in this zoo at all. We weren't the only guests who were upset by these visably unhappy animals- we overheard several other English tourists saying how unwell and sad they looked. Other smaller animals looked equally distressed in their enclosures, circling the insides of their cages having obviously gone stir crazy. The penguins looked happy enough, but then they have been granted a huge habitat to frolic in together while the largest animals are cramped and isolated which makes no sense! I feel conflicted by the concept of zoos, but feel sadly they may be our only chance of witnessing much of the wildlife we have. Zoos like this have a responsibilty to nurture breeding and conservation of species but this zoo sadly falls short."

Visited the Zoo on Thursday 19/03/15 with my girlfriend we walked from our hotel which was near Fredericksplein and took us approximately 15 minutes , The Zoo cost \u20ac19.95 and all i can say it was money well spent we spent 5 hours in the zoo and found it amazing . The weather that day was also good which made the experience even better , The zoo also has many indoor attractions so on a wet day it would still be well worth a visit . A Planetarium is also inside but we didnt have time to go in , the highlights for us where the free roaming animal rooms these where fantastic as you can get so close to the animals , a large aquarium and insectarium is also inside . The zoo has all sorts of animals from insects, birds, penguins, monkeys , gorrillas, giraffe, zebra, crocs, fish , it is well worth visiting the zoo for families or couples etc Food and drinks are also available inside but a picnic would also be a great idea because you really can make a full day from the zoo, and being so close to Amsterdam centre you would be mad not to visit"

There's loads too see from giraffes, monkeys, wolves, elephants , birds , sea lions , penguins ,butterfly's and many many more! There's is a big building for the aquarium and there's some cool fish. Or you can choose to go see the butterfly's, they roam around free and are very beautiful! Just check yourself when you leave to make sure you don't have any on your clothing! They are currently building an area for the jaguars too. The only criticism I do have is that I love lions, and I saw 4 lions in a really tiny enclosed space, if they wanted to be outside they couldn't really move around much. Anyway I would definitely recommend! We used tram 14 or 9 from central station! I heard food was expensive so we just bought a few sandwiches and drinks along with us :)"

We ended up spending our last day in Amsterdam at the zoo, and although a slightly different pace to our travels around the city centre, it was such a great way to spend a day. The queue to get in meant a short wait, but there were pamphlets to keep us entertained and the queue moved quickly. By the time we'd bought our tickets we had a map, a list of events on that day and had been helped by a very friendly member of staff. On weekends some of the zoologists do guided tours of the zoo, which we decided to join in on. They were very accommodating by speaking in English and Dutch so that we, along with the locals, felt involved. I'd definitely recommend doing this as you get a history of the zoo, a fairly comprehensive tour and in some cases behind the scenes looks into how the animals are cared for. They have a great range of animals to see, and in all cases are trying to help with the conservation and protection of animals under their care and around the world by encouraging breeding programmes and introducing their visitors to the plights of some of the more endangered creatures. Even in the freezing cold we enjoyed ourselves and the aquarium at the back with a mini museum tagged on was a really nice find when a bit of warmth was needed. The only disappointing part of the zoo was the lack of organisation and the crowds in the restaurants. Despite giving you very little choice but to buy inside the zoo, the few cafes there seemed to be low on food and filled to bursting with prams blocking the doors and people very confused about where they should queue. Other than that it was a wonderful day out which we would highly recommend to anyone with an interest in animals."

But the fact that it is in Amsterdam doesn't really bring any distinction to this zoo. Yes it is in the middle of the city and that's not ordinary, but you won't learn a lot about the Dutch fauna. It's a nice and fun activity but that's all."

The queue was quite big, we had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get in. The zoo is quite big for a zoo in middle of the city. Our first impression was that the animals seem to be very sad and haven\u00b4t always got enough place. In the enclosures isn\u00b4t any grass or anything green. Okay we were there in February and it rained a lot, but still. The two gibbons have a small \"island\" with about three ropes, and that should be a gibbon island. The mandrills have two thrown out Christmas trees to play with. In the camel field: camels, donkeys, reindeers and watusi cows together. Why? Only because all of them are hoofed animals? The aquarium is quite nice, but there is a part where stuffed animals are, and there is also a diorama with stuffed animals. If I go to the zoo I don`t want to see stuffed animals. The only reason I give the zoo 2 points and not only one is the butterfly pavilon. It is really nice and the butterflies fly actually on you and they are beautiful. But even after the pavilon I was very sad after leaving the zoo, and I was sorry for the animals."

It's a beautiful place, well landscaped, with enclosures well spaced so it didn't feel like everything was on top of each other. The admission price was pretty good (not like London Zoo!!) and they have a wide spectrum of animals, some of which I had not even heard of!It's worth a visit if you like animals, they appear to do good work and in the majority the animals seemed comfortable and not the normal stressed appearance you often get in European zoo's."

Throwing things at the animals whilst their parents watched, some trying to stamp on ducks and chasing them, absolutely disgusting and no keepers were seen the whole time I was there, no one to tell children not what to do, no one anywhere. The lack of enrichment within the enclosure was also disturbing as the animals all just looked like they'd gone crazy. So shocked at the lack of animal welfare within this zoo in this day and age.

There is however a major problem that needs to be addressed. A lot of the animal enclosures are far too small. This is especially the case for the elephants and the lions. The male lion seemed very distressed. Yes it is good for us humans to look round because it is not far to walk from one enclosure to another, however it is clearly cruel to the animals. Also other than the gorillas, there was not much evidence of stimulation for the animals, e.g. they were just laying the food in front of them rather than making them forage for it. The zoo is clean, and it was interesting to see animals that I have not seen before, however, there are serious concerns for the welfare of animals in terms of space."

We loved the afternoon we spent at the Artis Zoo but could have quite easily spent the whole day there - it is massive and there is so much to see! My highlight was the monkey house where you walk through and there are small monkeys, birds, bats and even a sloth roaming free all around you. You can get so close to them, it was a fantastic experience! The zoo is huge and it is easy to miss things if you get off track - we could have done with a map! All the animals were fantastic - we were lucky enough to see a baby chimpanzee being fed by its mother which was really special. The Lions, Giraffes, Elephants and Gorillas were great too! Would love to go again.If you fancy a warm little snack find the Poffertjes house by the petting zoo."

There is an aquarium which is beautiful and very relaxing and also you can go in a small planetarium but hardly any of it was in English so that was a waste of time but you don't have to pay extra to get in so it didnt matter. We used our Iamsterdam cards anyway so the whole day was free. I can imagine that it gets very very busy during the summer so go early. As it was winter during our trip there weren't that many people around so we got to see everything and take our time. Well worth it!!"

My husband and I love zoos, we have tried to see as many in the Netherlands as we could, the Artis, is the one we have seen the most frequent..we have seen this zoo in all seasons,, its the most beautiful landscaped Zoo we have seen in the Spring. It is the oldest zoo in the Netherlands and probably in all of Europe,,The animals appear to be very well cared for, we really enjoy each one, and we have our favorite animals that we love going to see. We try to see the new babies that are out with their parents,, it is such a joy to see. There are several nice places to grab a drink and a snack,,I especially love the one where you can see the zebras and water fowl..Our only disappointment is when the schools bring the kids to the zoo, they are undisciplined for the most part, the teachers or aides do not seem to be BOTHERED by the bad behavior, they scream and run and jump , it is quite annoying ,, this occurs every time there are a load of school kids at the zoo. It is too bad the schools and the teachers have no control over the unruly kids. No we are not fuddy duddys but it would be nice to go to the zoo with out screaming kids running thru the zoo.Aside from our gripe about the school kids,, it is a fantastic zoo"

This is a lovely zoo,we have been here 3 times now,and each time it has been as good as the time before.You can get up close to the animals and birds.The penguins swim pass you just by your feet.The inside enclosures are great where the birds and animals are free.The people in the enclosures are very good they point out the smaller mammals to you so you don't miss them.They are very knowledgeble and informative as well.The butterfly room is lovely and there were so many flying around its so lovely to see.When we were there this time there was a lot of work going on around the site as they are increasing the jaguar area and it will be very large by the looks of it.It would be nice to go and see the results.There are a few places to eat but we go to the one where you can look out onto the zebras.The food is okay to.The wolves were howling which was amazing to hear and they can go from one side of their enclosure to the other by a tunnel that goes under the path you walk over.It really is a full days trip out as aswell as the zoo there is the aquarium with loads of tanks of fish and the planetarium to go in as well if you wish.This time it was December for our visit and it was a drizzly day but it didn't stop us from having a great time.We also walk there from our hotel and it takes about half an hour so we get to see more of the city as we go.But i believe the no9 tram takes to there anyway.A well worth visit."

This is by far the worst zoo I have ever been to! 20\u20ac to go in which is acceptable as I have paid this before, and on top buying a map which is 2\u20ac which apparently goes towards improvement for the elephants, so of course se purchased. As soon as you start walking round you begin to think where is the rest of the money going? It certainly isn't going on the animals! I've never seen animals look so unhappy and stressed and ill! The majority of the zoo only has one animal in a huge pen all by itself along with a huge dead tree stood in the middle. The animals are just curled up in a corner shivering and shaking because they're so cold and skinny. On the contrary some cages have far too many animals in for the size! There were 4 elephants in one cage when there was barely enough space for 1! I will admit that the inside parts are well presented and the animals inside seemed much happier! It's so cold in Amsterdam, why not make the whole thing an inside zoo? It's really run down and needs some serious TLC. I think clearly the staff are pocketing the money because you can tell the animals aren't gaining anything. The only animals that looked content were the Penguins and seals, and that is because they are meant to be in cold surroundings! I really can't understand how there are so many great reviews on here."

It felt really sad to see that, and to be honest, I just wanted to leave after that.

The zoo is also home to an aquarium and planetarium, as well as an insect house. There are plenty of places to duck into if the weather isn't great to wait for the showers to stop, and plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy a picnic or just sit and watch the animals. The zoo was very clean with no litter or cigarettes anywhere. We went in a day where there were several school trips, but as the zoo grounds are so large we were able to explore peacefully for most of the day. The zoo does also have a cafe but the menu is limited and a little overpriced, so we didn't bother purchasing anything from there.

There is an island where you can walk around with the monkeys while they are squaking at each other. no need to be afraid. The elephant enclosure is another good area to visit - especially when the young ones decide they want to play ball and dad doesn't :) the souvenir shop is limited as is the cafe but the animals are all well looked after and there are regular information sessions from the keepers.

A little expensive to get in unless you can find a discount, once in we followed the signs around which were easy to read. loved the seals and penguins. The best bit was the butterfly house as they fly pass or land on you. Monkey house was good too as you can walk around while they are free to roam about you (little monkeys!). Lion area did seem a little small but they did not look uneasy and you could see them well. Some other zoos have such a large enclosure you often can not even spot them. we didnt have food as we took sandwiches. You can easily spend four or so hours here. well maintained, lots of keepers around to help tell you about things."

I stroked a couple even though you weren't meant to and it was the softest thing I have ever touched! The staff member didn't tell me off, he just laughed and shook his head and waggled his finger.

When people ask us what we like about out neighbourhood we always say: every morning we are awoken by elephants and monkeys! Due to the abundance of birds in the zoo we also enjoy the twittering (no pun intended) of multiple birds both local and exotic that are attracted by their relatives in captivity although their captivity has been greatly assuaged by allocation of more individual space. The zoo offers a lot of amenities for both homo sapiens as other animals. I really enjoy taking my grandchildren out for a picknick in Artis. Also during summer months parties are organised within closed doors which makes the zoo a kind of family member. Right across from the zoo there are many nice restaurants for young&old"

There is an array of features including the butterfly house, a fascinating aquarium and some cheeky monkeys who throw dust at people who get too close.There is an excellent cafe at the African Plains which serves hot and cold food including little punnets of strawberries and fruit. The planetarium wasn't working the day we were there but staff gave us free tickets for another visit to make up. Can't complain about that.Given its not quite the size and splendour of say Zurich Zoo but its an honest attempt to develop a well laid out and animal friendly environment.The only thing a little annoying was that the planetarium programme is in Dutch. Really for an international zoo that welcomes many thousands of overseas visitors - the commentary needs to be in English or at least English subtitles.Staff at the zoo and cafes were very polite and friendly and didn't object to tourists needing directions to the next attraction. Worth a visit and a leisurely stroll.Trams regularly pass by the zoo, particularly the 9 and 14 trams"

I tend to be quite sceptical about zoos as I adore animals and don't completely agree with having animals in captivity. My view on zoos revolve around 3 core things...animal welfare, value of education to the community and conservation efforts. I'd say Artis works pretty well on all of these points.The habitats are very well laid out, as this is a city zoo to enclosures aren't the biggest but they have done a great job with them. Where possible they have gone down the European route of avoiding fences or walls and using moat's instead, this is much better for the animals. Above all else the zoo and enclosures are incredibly clean. The big cat enclosures needs reworking, but they are in the process of construction on the new buildings they will be moving them too. The zoo has a great combination of animals, architecture and gardens. The staff are very friendly and the talks are very worthwhile. Would certainly recommend."

If you see the big cats' and wolves' cages (and yes, these are cages, not compounds), the monkey 'islands', the sea lions' pool, and many of the other 'attractions', you feel like you've traveled at least 50 years back in time. Yes, this might be one of the oldest zoos in Continental Europe, but this is not an excuse for its 'standards'.The 'savanna' area appears to be up-to-date at first glance. However, soon you'll notice ostriches standing close to the fences apparently stuck in some sort of a traumatic loop (supposedly caused by having been in way too small cages for years) that forces them do the same thing time and again every couple of seconds. It's sad. Really sad.Some reviewers have pointed out the 'beauty' of the aquariums--in most reef tanks, the reefs are dead (or barely alive). Half of the tanks look like they haven't been cleaned in months. Great aquariums? I don't think so.Granted, the butterfly dome (whatever its name is) is neat. At least in theory. There were kids running around and screaming (as they did in the entire park) with no respect for other visitors (ok, these are kids) or the animals. If the parents can't (or don't want to) keep their kids in check, you'd expect that someone from the zoo would intervene, but no. (Not directly related to the zoo, but: Indeed, I saw two kids spitting at animals. When I told them to stop, their mother came up, telling me not to tell her kids what (not) to do. Ok.)To top it all off, they charge 20 Euros per ticket. Please don't go there and support Artis. Whatever would happen to the animals if this zoo were to close down couldn't be much worse than the dire existence they're living right now."

There are a few places where you can roam around the animals, the Vari's a kind of lemurs, walk around on an island, and sometimes even jump on your shoulder, since they are perfectly harmless, I like such an experience a lot. Buttreflies dart around in a lovely greenhuse and every day you can hear stories on specific times on the seals, the penguins, the evultures and many more animals. You learn a lot from the people who take care of these creatures and all of them are enthousiast about their \"own\" special animal.Not all animals are present since Artis doe not want to perpetuate capturing wild animals to boast they also have a Tiger or a dolphin. Artis does however also help with breeding the rare oryx."

Make sure to visit the gorillas, giraffes and lions! There are also cheeky meerkats and penguins all really close up. The butterfly enclosure was also fantastic, and you get an aquarium experience thrown in, too. Insect room not my bag, but loved the reptiles.We paid the 2 euro donation for a zoo map, and I'm glad we did, as the signs were sometimes confusing. Agreed that it was a shame not all the signs were repeated in English, but what can you expect! Definitely worth a visit, even if you don't have kids. We're 26/27 and just act like kids! Loved it!"

Artis Zoo is one if not the oldest zoo in Europe and to be honest it shows. although they are clearly trying to keep up with more modern zoos and the grounds are kept well, I couldn't get over the small enclosures and tiny cages. I am sure in some warped world these probably meet some kind of standard set in Europe as being acceptable, but when there are so many zoos that offer larger spaces and that have more facilities that are better equipped to care for the animals I just think in my heart that the animals kept at Artis should be re-homed else where, where the animals will receive a better quality of life."

Also the individual pens are very smartly arranged so that each doesn't feel like a cramped box for the animal(s) even though some are fairly small. The restaurant area is nice and well located next to kids' playground so you can have lunch while your wee one is monkeying around on ropes and seesaws. Food is OK - Dutch staples (bitterballen type snacks) which are too bland and fairly boring for my liking but there are salads and baguettes as well so it isn't all kroketts ;) It isn't the cheapest of attractions, though and the free kid ticket cut-off age is 3. Still, it is money well spent and the zoo is worth coming back to."

We were unable to find them. There's a sign saying they're at their outdoor enclosure, but no explanation where that is. The giraffes, too, were not where they show up on the map, and we found them by chance. And this is a map that costs 2 euro!* The planetarium is a nice bonus, but be aware: showtimes on the schedule are subject to change, and this announcement will be on the screen outside the planetarium entrance, and in Dutch. Not speaking Dutch, we had two very disappointed kids who were rushed across the zoo to see a space movie, only to learn there is a reserved screening for school about underwater life."

We saw all the well known animals like lions, elephants, giraffes, etc, but also so many others. The yards, cages, resting areas for people, everything seemed vast and very nice. There are special habitat-like buildings where animals are free to roam around you, monkeys jump above you and it's amazing - iguana 10cm from you! Staff was nice on several occasions and focused our attention on animals which were harder to be seen. There's also a building with many aquariums and a planetarium which is free, but the shows are only in Dutch. Even so, we enjoyed the show as visually it is very nice."

It was a beautiful sunny day so it made the day even better, it took us about 4 hours to walk around and see everything. There is a LOT to see in there, who says it's \"not great\" or similar stuff is not right at all!!!! I've been to the zoo in Prague and Zvolen Slovakia so I know what a good zoo looks like.. It was definitely the highlight of our trip for me and my boyfriend loved it too. Never been to a Zoo where you have monkeys jumping over your head and butterflies flying around you and you feel like you were in a rain forest! Didn't manage to go in to the planetarium but we are going back in 5 months so I won't miss it this time!"

Enclosures were on the small side and some a little stony and unnatural. However others looked like a real effort had been made to keep animals comfortable. There is even a new enclosure being built for a breeding project for Jaguars. Lots of animals to see close up. Zoo grounds are pretty with lovely flowers etc. would recommend for a day out in Amsterdam especially with children."

I think though that once you have been to Chester zoo in England though you won't be totally impressed by this one, although we did enjoy our day, we were probably in there about 3 hours but could have taken longer if we had watched the feeding sessions and talks and had a meal. My favourite part was probably the seal enclosure which you could watch them swimming through a wall of glass."

It's a great place to get up close and personal with some of nature's finest animals. A bright late summer's day completed the great experience.

The little one loved that one can almost touch the butterflies because there were so many flying about.One can easily spend a minimum of 1/2 day at the zoo. There are 2 restaurants and several food carts that sell food throughout the zoo. 2 bonus to the zoo - there is a big playground outside the Restaurant de Twee Cheetahs and there are free carts to use for carting a young child around if you are without a pram. We had a great outing, though not a cheap outing - family of 3 (2 adults + 1 child) the cost was \u20ac 56.40 plus \u20ac 2 for a map.

Our first view was the enclosure with the camels and reindeer in it. It was just sand ???. No grass anywhere and not particulary big. This unfortunately was a theme that continued throughout the zoo. On looking at the map that was a additional charge 1.99. We concluded that it was laid out really oddly with many small enclosures and no definitive route. The first few animals we came across were in small cramped areas. No space to run around at all and some empty. The place just seemed old and dirty as well. Some places smelt really badly. The enclosure with the giraffes and zebras was a welcome relief. It seems that it is a newer enclosure and looked good.The butterfly house was nice as well but trying to look into the sea loin enclosure was so dirty you couldn't see any thing.The aquarium is a welcome relief. It is laid out really well with lots to see. Really liked the canal exhibit. On heading down that side of the zoo they are revamping that side with new enclosures which was nice to see.Just hope for the animals sake they keep revamping the place as it needs a lot of investment to get it up to standard.Id even like to see less animals but with larger more natural enclosures."

But after reading reviews and doing some research it seemed okay, and my other half really wanted to visit while we were staying in Amsterdam.It was an amazing day out! The Zoo is putting so much of its funding into creating a natural and happy life for their animals. They are currently raising funds for a new and bigger Elephant enclosure whilst a new Panther enclosure is being built so that the other large cats can have more space. (This was reassuring as I didn't think the other cats looked like they had a comfortable amount of living space). The rest of the animals all looked happy and healthy and were kept in large, natural enclosures.The Zoo is very keen to encourage interaction between the animals as they would in the wild, and so they are kept in enclosures together. I.e. Giraffes and Zebras together. This is something I haven't seen in other Zoos. Additionally, a lot of the indoor enclosures have no barriers and allow the visitors to actually walk through the habitats, examples of this are with the smaller species of monkeys, birds and bats. There is also a small aquarium within the Zoo, another great little place to visit. We went on a nice sunny day and there are some lovely little garden areas to sit and relax, the park is kept clean and well kept and I really couldn't fault it! Tickets are reasonably priced at 20 Euros."

Lots of space to sit down in garden areas but it was crowded today - not a bad thing though considering lots of zoos don't have those areas. Animals appeared active and healthy from what we observed. The cooler weather had the animals active today which was a plus. Nice zoo and we look forward to seeing all the construction complete on the west side of the property."

The entrance fee is 16.50 euros for children and 19.50 euros for adults. The zoo is kept clean and tidy although when we visited there was quite a bit of work being done altering the animal enclosures.The zoo itself is quite large but easy to get round with a map that is given to everyone on entrance.The cages are kept clean and the animals seem content as much as possible being locked up all day. The bird cages are large enough for the birds to be able to fly freely as are most of the animal enclosures.There is an area where you walk where the animals roam free' and also a childrens area where they can get up close to pets which are mainly farm animals. There are also plenty of restaurants around the zoo.A planetarium is also included in the entrance fee.All in all well worth a visit."

The butterfly exhibit is excellent as is the aquarium. There are some nice walk through areas with free roaming birds, lizards and marmoset monkeys. Some exhibits had signs in English and Dutch, some just Dutch, some none at all and quite a few were wrong which was a bit shabby. The elephant exhibit is a bit small and it's a bit outdated in some areas which still have the old style 'iron bar' look.Overall it was worth a visit, you can get a few euros knocked off if you buy your ticket before hand from a bureau. The exhibits are mostly good and the animals look fit and contented."

The animals are all healthy and in fairly open enclosures and you can see them at close quarters. It's also not a very extensive zoo which makes it just right for younger kids. My 4 year old loved the sea lions (we watched the zookeeper make them do tricks), the butterfly garden, giraffes, llamas and elephants. The lions were pretty impressive too and quite surprisingly not caged in. the zookeeper talks are in Dutch only though, so we couldnt follow what he was saying but we enjoyed all the things he made the animals do. There's also a slide in the shape of a giraffe which my daughter loved - what a lovely idea for a slide. Usually the zoo is open till 6 p, but on Saturdays in June, July, Aug, the zoo is open till sunset (which is like 9 pm) and you are allowed to make a picnic on the grass - wish we had known this. There's also a planetarium with several shows (no extra charge) - it's all in Dutch, no english shows, but my child likes \"being in space\" and didn't care too much about the commentary. the shows are about 25 minutes long, we went for the one called \"Spacetrip\" which seemed to be a general show about the universe, stars and planets. We ate at the planetarium cafe which offers soup, sandwiches (incl. vegetarian options), juices and coffee. You are also allowed to bring your own food in - there is a microwave in the cafe to warm up food and baby milk which was very handy."

It's not cheap...16.95 for kids (my 11 year old nephew had to pay for an adult ticket) and 19.50 for adults, but you can definitely spend at least half a day there. There are several different cafes and restaurants, we had a snack and drink at the one near the entrance and it was simple but fine, not excessively expensive either.

The zoo is well served by public transport, we caught the tram from the city centre within 10 minutes. The zoo tickets are affordable at \u20ac20, although you have to buy the map for \u20ac2 but this money goes towards a newer and bigger enclosure for the elephants. Much needed!!I was really impressed with how close you can get to the animals here, and how many of them were not caged up, which allowed beautiful photos without railings and cages in the way. The zoo grounds are beautiful and spotless. The majority of enclosures were really well thought out. Some of the animals seemed a bit distressed and were pacing up and down or showing unusual behaviour - this is why I have not given the zoo 5 stars. I think the zoo is aware of this and are trying to sort their problems out, by proposing a smaller car park to make space for bigger enclosures.The ticket price includes entrance to the planetarium and aquarium, excellent value for money. Although we watched a show in in the planetarium in Dutch and didn't understand a word!Brilliant day out :)"

My family and I were in Amsterdam for four days and were preparing to visit the key attractions, museums, etc. when my kids who are older teenagers suggested going tot he zoo as they had heard that it is less about caged areas and more about open enclosures. My wife and I agreed expecting a standard zoo with nothing of great surprise. How wrong we were! First of all, the layout is great for getting around easily without the awkwardness of having to double back but what was particularly impressive was how we moved from one enclosure to the next with the level of interest being maintained throughout. Our usual experience of zoos is that there are key animals which are the \"star attractions\" and others that tend to be walked past with a glance. Many are even hidden away that are hard to see. In the Artis Zoo, we moved from one great point of interest to the next and actually did this from 10.30am to 5.30pm with two breaks, it was just so interesting. I think the key aspect which made it so interesting was the close proximity to the animals and just how lively the animals were. They seemed very bright and content and we observed much interaction and play going on. If there is such a thing as a \"happy\" zoo, this is it! Intiially, we felt that the 20 Euro admission fee each was a bit high, but on leaving after a great day, we felt that it had been money well spent."

If you are in Amsterdam with children - definitely have a trip to Artis Zoo on your list of Things to Do. Its in deceivingly large grounds with pretty well maintained surroundings. There's also a planetarium with a variety of shows (included in the price). The layout for the animals is pretty much flat (not that unusual in the Netherlands :) ) with only the sealions and bears having enclosures that are up a hill/stairs. That said, the aquarium has some impressive exhibits and that is on a couple of different floors. If you've a buggy keep an eye out for the lifts. Some of the enclousures look run down - there is a line just past the elephants of what should have been medium sized cats that were all empty. That said, when we were visiting there was a building works program going on so perhaps they are on a list to be refurbished. Given its a city zoo you're pretty close to the animals - close enough so that you could almost touch the penguins. For many of the animals there is a clever use of water to separate enclosures and give you and your small people unobstructed views. There is a lot to see in the zoo with many different animals large and small. While my youngest daughter loved seeing Elmer I've got to wonder if the enclosure was big enough for the family in there who looked as if they could do with access to water on the hot day we visited. Perhaps its time to take the lead of London and Edinburgh and move the elephants to a zoo with more space. Very helpful and friendly staff. An impressive adventure play park and decent prices for food and drink inside. I enjoyed it and would visit again.Take the #9 tram from the central station to get there: takes @15 mins. #9 is suitable for buggys/strollers if you get on in the middle. Tram tip - you can get off at the middle doors with a buggy, and press the buzzer as you come up to the Artis stop."

I was expecting a lot from this zoo considering the 20 euro entry fee.Most of the animals were healthy but several did not look well at all. The spaces for a the larger animals like Elephants was far too small, even by zoo standards.The aquariums were filthy. You can tell how a place is maintained by the look of the saltwater aquariums. They were severely infested with bristle stars and red algae. Not a good look and the fish will decline soon after.The most shameful thing was several families I saw walking around with prams and / or toddlers and smoking. Disgusting. I cant imagine what it does to the animals."

The zoo itself is not the biggest or most impressive but incredibly beautiful, with lovely old buildings and a rich history, being one of the oldest zoos in Europe. We particularly loved the large conservatory type buildings filled with tropical plants, monkeys and birds that you are free to walk through. The aquarium is also well worth the visit and is included in the price. All in all a wonderful day out and most certainly one to visit to get away from the busy city."

It's a large City zoo and there's lots to see, the ticket price is justified, London Zoo is over \u00a320 for an adult, which is of course considerably more when you consider the exchange rate! Nice features such as the butterfly garden, which has lots of beautiful and large butterflies flying around the enclosure freely. I will comment however that some of the enclosures are questionable, for example, I don't feel that the lions or the other big cats had enough room at all! It was a nice day out and will take 2-3 hours to walk around and see everything at a leisurely pace."

The zoo was quite large but easy to navigate with lots of sign posts. The variety of animals was great and there was even an insect house, butterfly house and aquarium. You could get really close to the animals, especially in lemur land where they were roaming free and coming right up to you!"

The zoo is great, nicely set up, with lots of green areas and good variety of animals. Our son loved it and we also enjoyed it.What i did not like: it is very expensive, 20 euro for adult is the most expensive ticket we bought in amsterdam. They also charge 17 euro for kids 3 years and older and 2 euro for map (wow, thats greedy!).Another disappointing thing was a platerium show, run in dutch and quite boring so we left after a few minutes (so did a few other groups)."

We easily spent a couple of hours in the zoo, you could probably take longer with young children, or if you were interested to read all of the information of the individual exhibits. There were multiple places to buy something to eat or drink within the zoo however we did not buy anything so cannot comment on the prices or quality. Some of the exhibits looked quite small for the animals, primarily the lions and the animals in the aquarium. However, there were a lot of staff on site, and while there we saw the reptile house being cleaned and the animals looked well attended.The zoo is a roughly 30 minute walk away from the centre of Amsterdam, we walked, however the Metro ran alongside on the main roads to the zoo. Several areas of the zoo were closed for renovations and building work, and while this did detract from the overall aesthetic, it appeared as though the zoo was well tended to."

It has all the animals you would expect to see plus reptiles, spiders and other creepy-crawlies I would flatten with a phone book if I saw them in my living room!I spent ages walking around the large grounds but most of my time was spent watching, photographing and filming the monkeys going ape in their enclosure; I was thankful for the thick glass separating them from me and keeping me safe!Another highlight was the appearance and bizarre behaviour of a big, brown bear that performed an OCD-like ritual several times in my presence.I may not have visited this zoo had it not been free to do so but I'm glad I did.

This is a very nice zoo indeed, and was our first stop in a tour of European zoos... all in all it holds up well and I would say as far as national zoos go, it trumps London zoo.You can tell that at its core this is an old zoo, with a number of old exhibits such as the spectacled bear enclosure, macaque island, chimpanzee exhibit and many of the old buildings still being in place. I think that many of these could do with a major overhaul, and some of the animals could certainly do with a lot more space (such as the lions). However saying that there are some gorgeous exhibits here.The reptile house is quite nice, and the aquarium is absolutely stunning. This are also has a museum which is very well laid out and interesting.The Giraffe and Zebra have a very nice large open paddock near the restaurant (which as you'd expect in such an attraction is a bit pricey but very nice), however the elephants on the other hand seemed to have very little space in comparison.All in all a beautiful place, certainly worth visiting... Some improvements need to be made but you would expect this in an old zoo, where the age of the buildings may well prohibit them from making such changes in the future."

            "review": "Small but good zoo - park. As a child my father took me to our local zoo almost every weekend. Some of my best early memories come from these trips. Now I am a father myself, I take my son to our local zoo myself. At the moment Artis is our local zoo. It's located on the Eastern side of Amsterdam's city center. That makes it very easy to get to, but at the same time limits zoo expansion. This is not one of the world's largest zoos. It is however one of the oldest, and preserves as much of its old architectural splendor as is possible while adapting enclosures to modern views on animal welfare. The aquarium in particular is a beautiful neo-classicist building which has lost none of its charm. Several other buildings are currently being restored and will open this summer as a museum of the zoo's history and a microbe zoo (if your zoo is small, exhibit small animals). Not that all animals are small, there are elephants, giraffes, lions, ostriches, zebras and a sealion aquarium. Still, Artis seems at its best with more humble creatures. The butterfly house is beautifully peaceful (except on weekends and holidays), there is a bird and small primate house with free roaming monkeys, bats and birds, and a remarkable arthropod exhibit (do not enter if afraid of spiders!)Artis is particularly innovative in how it feeds the animals. This is most noticeable in the vulture, african hunting dog and wolf enclosures, where the animals are fed whole carcasses instead of chopped-up meat. It's entirely normal to see a half-eaten lemur or goat being torn up or dragged around. A bit grisly, but normal and stimulating behaviour for carnivores.Because of its small size and location Artis can get very busy. If possible avoid weekends and holidays altogether; most Dutch primary schoolchildren have Wednesday afternoon off, so it's pretty full then too. If you're visiting with small children, notice the free hand carts about 150m from the entrance (just by the Japanese macaques). Put in a EUR 2 deposit and drag your little one around if you don't have a pushchair. There aren't many of them, so be early if you need one. By the entrance you can also pick up a weekly 'newspaper' showing feeding times for various animals and other interesting talks and happenings. It is available in both English and Dutch.As with most other Dutch zoos, Artis is rather expensive for a single visit, but if you have a season ticket to other European zoos there is a good chance that you qualify for some form of concession. The reverse is also true: you can get 50% off most other NL and BE zoos with your Artis ticket. This is very good value as a season ticket only costs as much as three seperate tickets. If you think you'll be visiting more often, get one straight away."

I didn't know in this day and age that you were allowed to keep animals in such old fashioned, dirty and cramped conditions - it was something out of the Victorian era. The most horrible conditions were reserved for the lions - 4 lions with hardly any room to move. Such magnificent creatures - I just felt ashamed to be a human looking at them. Other animals pacing up and down in that horrible psychotic way animals do when they are trapped. Please turn this place into a garden."

However, I love going to foreign zoos and aquariums and decided to go anyways. I am glad I did! We bought the 2 tickets at the zoo as well as the map, yes you have to pay for the park map, honestly though I don't mind paying a bit more knowing the money is going to a zoo. It was a rainy day so we were grateful for all the indoor habitats that were warm and dry. The bird sanctuary was wonderful being that the birds could roam all around you, so be careful of the bird poop! After being to the aquarium in Barcelona the aquarium in the Artis zoo was a bit of a let down, but still nice. Walking through the butterfly sanctuary was wonderful, walking through with all the butterflies fluttering around us. On a side note the planetarium information is all in Dutch, so unless you read Dutch it's rather pointless."

The grounds are clean, well presented and the staff are extremely friendly and speak both Dutch and English.It's definitely worth a visit if you are visiting and looking for something to do for the whole family.

Yes, most definately.Value for money: ***Entertainment rating:****Location rating:****Family friendly rating: *****"

For example there are a couple of very sorry looking Kookaburras in a cage with some sea birds!? My husband is Australian and you see these guys in the bush very commonly, we thought it was a bit of an odd environment for them. And like with any zoo you will get someone complaining about the animal welfare - but we did feel strongly that the amount of space the cheetahs and lions had was a bit on the small side. We had a nice morning with our son who loved looking at the animals, but we did leave feeling a bit disappointed."

Very typical to the zoo, a mount of artifical rocks trying to resemeble some natural landscape from the moon maybe. The monkeys sitting on ledges around the bizarre rock arrangement. There were many such hard and grotesque displays around the park. The worse part was the Gorillas enclosure or dungeon I should say. What hits you right away when you enter is the stench. The Gorillas are kept in a small concreat room sounded by glass for the people to be able to watch every move and jeer and the poor primates. After a few minutes I noticed the male and leading female trying to go back to the cofinment of their inner cell, just to get away from the jeering people. I also noticed more than one individual eating feces, which is known indication of distress and mental problem. The choices of food are mostly junk food with little vegetarian options. No surprise there. Very sad exhibition emphasising peoples ignorance and cruelty. Avoid this park!!!"

It was busy, but didn't feel crowded - just a short queue to get in and very little queuing at any of the facilities. We ended up sending four hours there - more than we expected - the zoo is cleverly laid out so that it feels a lot bigger than it is. The flower displays were as good as many a town park, and there are plently of benches to sit and relax. Visitors felt close to the animals - even among them in a few places.To our non-expert eyes, the standards of animal welfare were good. Conditions in city zoos are never going to be ideal for big cats, and there was a solitary bear that looked bored out of its head - but the zoo stated it was a temporary home as part of a breeding programme.If we'd realsied how long we were going to spend there we'd have brought a picnic - the cafes on site are ok but nothing special. Other than that we throroughly enjoyed our visit and would go back again if we were in the city in good weather."

I'm not a fan of zoos anyway but against my better judgement we went for a visit just because our hotel was right across the road from it. I really wish we hadn't of bothered, not just because of the 40 euro (for two, entrance fee) but because of the lack of space the animals have.There is several exotic animals in this zoo and not any of them have ample living space. The lion and his three lioness looked very bored and hungry. The elephants, even though they are expecting a new enclosure were couped up in a very lackluster environment and it just broke my heart to see the baby in there. I'm sure the animals are looked after but it pains me to know this baby elephant will be there for the rest of its life.The zoo is very spacious and there is a lot of areas where other animals could benefit from their enclosures being expanded, I get that it's expensive but if they can't home the animals appropriately maybe they shouldn't have them at all. The tiger and the leopard especially as they were kept in very small (for their size) cages.The zoo would benefit from making a bit more of a bigger deal of its aquarium as it's located in a really lovely building and is home to several species of fish and underwater creatures. It really impressive although slightly dark.I really could go on a tangent on how much I dislike zoos but it's for reasons like this one that I do. There really needs to be more efforts to adapt the animals living arrangements especially if they are going to attempt to keep so many exotic animals. The poor speckled bear was SO bored he was doing circles and circles and circles in his little box of land he had. It basically looked like a dumping ground of old logs with no rhymed or reason and it just didn't look great at all. Same goes for the giraffes, they were out in the soaking wet rain trying to eat from the gutter."

I was completely taken aback by the size of the zoo and the wide variety of animals present: e.g. giraffes, lions, elephants, red pandas etc. I was fairly impressed with the space available to most of the animals and the steps taken to improve their conditions. By this I mean that the zoo is aiming to raise sufficient funds to allow the elephants to move to a larger enclosure which would appear to be needed. I would suggest people buy a map (2 EUR), the funds from this go towards funding the new elephant enclosure. Furthermore, I think that if we didn't have a map, we may have missed some of the animals due to the sheer size and number of animals in the zoo!The only animals I felt that could have had more space were the lions. However, perhaps this will improve with the elephants being moved. Great day out in Amsterdam for people of all ages (my partner and I being in our mid 20s) and something a bit different from museums, Anne Frank house or coffee shops!"

The animal quarters are good, and they take good care about the animals, this is a good thing, and a priority. For an old Zoo this is not any easy task, but they managed it. Prices are reasonable... But in my opinion they are not taking good care about their visitors... for example... the shortage of toilets.. Today one place was closed.. and at the entrance you just have for example 2 toilets for men... so a long que and very dirty. Also the restaurants are very inefficient especially if you like to have a coffee. Just one register... ?? also the decoration is very poorly. Every where you can see that you can make donations... But please... go work a bit more efficient and you can earn a lot of money.. More and More efficient places to get a drink or bite...

Maybe it was winter so some of the animals were sleepy but there is a huge variety of animals. The penguin enclosure was great! As were the lions and the elephants and the giraffes! There is a very very old aquarium and an educational building that shows taxonomy and the some other cool stuff about the evolution of animals. I thought that this zoo is one of the most educational ones. You really learn something there and it's not just about seeing all the animals. It's really great for kids too as there's plenty of space to run about but it might be good to bring a pram as they might get tired walking around (not from experience because we don't have kids but we saw many parents with their kids being pushed around in prams so it seems like a pretty good idea!)

The zoo itself is surprisingly large with a trip easily swallowing several hours and the selection of animals is impressive. Some enclosures are small to the point of bordering on cruel with the lions occupying a particularly small area. A highlight of the trip was seeing the community of red pandas who were very active, especially when compared with those seen in other zoos, where they could usually be substituted for soft toys without much difference.With the zoo having such a history I was disappointed that there was little of this evident and with no information available to buy. The gift shop has the usual selection of soft toys as well as some books detailing the history of the site. Regrettably these were only available in Dutch. An opportunity missed."

Love this zoo, its not a huge zoo but the attractions that are here are great. the butterfly pavilion is lovely providing great photo opportunities. the lion enclosure has no fence in the way so we get a great view of them. and they were very active at the midday mark. The wolves are another impressive feature as they put on a show nearly all the time howling along with each other. The enclosures are very well maintained which is good to see and you can also go in with the marmosets again another great feature. Only down side is it is a little expensive @ 19euros to get in per person and 2euros for a map. that's the same price as London zoo and London zoo is bigger however comparing the two the animals and enclosures in Amsterdam are much better than london"

There was some areas of the zoo where work was being done but this was minor. The walk ways through the monkey and bird enclosure was great for taking photos. Most enclosures were very good in a way that lets the public get close to the animals. The lion enclosure was very good for this. I feel the best enclosure was the wolf's. The wolfs put on a show for us. You could easily spend 3-4 hours here just watching the animals. Another small feature that worked well for DSLR users was the heaters that allowed you to demist your glasses or lenses, before taking photos inside the humid climate. Overall a great day out when in Amsterdam."

For 20\u20ac I expected a much, much nicer conditions for animals.) I do hope they start using the money wisely. Another huge issue I had - the primates and some other animals obviously need more vegetation, instead they have bamboo growing everywhere except inside their enclosures and cages.

I thought it was a bit of a shame that there weren't any tigers but as zoo's go it's not the biggest so you can't have it all. If it had been nicer weather we'd have probably got a lot more out of it, but even in the miserable weather we really enjoyed it. If you have kids I'd recommend it.

It was a cold and rainy day but we can't unfortunately choose the weather but with lots of indoor houses ie: the aquatic center we were able to keep dodging the rain and educating ourselves at the same time!At first we thought it looked a little unkempt as some areas were blocked off and we seemed to be getting nowhere fast but as we made our way around our fears were quashed and we really enjoyed ourselves. The butterfly indoor section was beautiful and the aquatic section fascinating. Many large animals like giraffes and elephants which we don't get to see in British zoos very often were here to see in full glory. We hadn't enough time so our visit was cut short and we had to rush at the end so please leave a whole day for yourselves to enjoy and get your money's worth. Reasonably priced for 3 adults ,was about 68 euros. Lots of incredible animals. Well worth the visit and will go again next time we are In lovely Amsterdam!"

We thought in the beginning 20 euros are quite expensive but it was worth every cent! The zoo is well maintained and the variety or animals you can see there is just amazing! The staff at the zoo was also really friendly and it's definitely a fun activity to do with your friends and family!!!The only minus point to mention is the expensive food and beverages at the zoo. Those are really over priced- so for those who wanna save some money- bring your own sandwiches and drinks!!!"

It was quite expensive to get in, about 18 Euros, if I remember correctly, plus I bought a map for nearly 2 euros (this was apparently going towards extending the elephant enclosure) It was quite a large zoo, with a good variety of animals. Most of the enclosures were decent, but some, like the lion enclosures were too small. The weather was cold, and although there seemed to be what looked like a little door in the walls of some (perhaps to an inside enclosure for them) most were closed. This could be because they were being cleaned or whatever but I felt sorry for them out in the freezing weather. On the other hand, the animals looked well cared for.There were a few different houses to go into as a break from the weather, butterfly house, birdhouses, monkeys, aquarium. All very informative. There were two or three cafes which I didn't visit. Great for kids, you could borrow a little cart to pull smaller children along on, also wheelchairs. I would recommend a visit, although expensive for families will while away a couple of hours"

There was a wide range of animals to view, and I especially enjoyed the lions, red pandas and monkeys. I still can't understand how some of the animals don't escape as many aren't enclosed, such as the red pandas! The main downside was that it appears a couple of the animals don't have much space such as the lions, but you can't see the enclosed areas they have this night not be as bad ad it seems. Overall a really enjoyable day and I would recommend it to any family :-)"

We had the privilege to be around for the feeding time of the california seals, which turned out to be the cutest thing! The zoo keeper throws fish at them and they catch it in the most cute and hilarious way! We really had a great laugh, and then later enjoyed watching a baby seal kissing kids on the cheek... So cute! Be sure to walk on the promenade, where you'll be surprised to discover a pouring waterfall... Also, don't miss out on the zoo's aquarium, where you'll find some crazy looking sea creatures."

Went to Amsterdam during October school holidays and decided to take our 10 year old daughter to the zoo as the weather was very good.Zoo was very reasonably priced and very easy to get to either walking from central or a 5 minute tram ride...would suggest to buy tickets before hand as there was quite a large queue,but with pre bought you got straight through.We were in the zoo which has a huge aquarium,an insect area and a beautiful butterfly house as well as all the birds and animals for round 3 and a half hours and it was excellent,we walked miles but never really noticed because there was so much to see.This zoo is a must for everyone,families with toddlers could get little carts for the little ones which they loved.Definitely would recommend."

The collection of over 900 species of animals, 200 different types of trees (of wich are 74 on the monuments list) makes this zoo an unique place. Sure, some of the housings could really use an update but Artis is working really hard to give all the animals the space they need. It's a constant struggle between keeping the original buildings, and still being modern in terms of housing the animals. A very goodaxample is the new monkey house on the left front side of the zoo. The building exterior is still original, but the inside is decorated like a jungle with several species of monkeys, bat and lizzards walking around you since there are no more bars."

Unbelievably small stinking enclosures for everything ,some creatures had barely enough space to take a few steps before they reached their limit....spoke to a member of staff who seemed surprised by my opinion,they have the legal limit of space,yes legal but not humane or correct for any of the animals to actually function as they should! This was no pleasant visit to an animal conservation zoo,this was a visit to a Victorian style and age zoo which has outlived its use.....the seals were swimming back and forth the bears rocking insanely in stinking concrete bunkers,the look in the eyes of most creatures was heartbreaking to the extreme! I am extremely surprised and shocked this has been allowed to continue to function,I can only assume money has passed hands or wildlife protection organisations have not actually observed without giving the zoo warning,if indeed they have ever crossed its threshold! Sad day wasted but report put in with relevant authorities,I am praying this establishment will,not be there for another hundred years,as humans we have a duty to give creatures surroundings similar to their natural habitat if we dare to claim we are caring for them or in a preservation breeding programme,some bird caged she birds had no space to fly,some animal enclosures allowed only for a few steps and certainly no running and bounding leaping as they were intended to do in the wild!

They have howling sessions where everyone congregates to see what all the fuss is about, the wolves seemed quite satisfied once everyone was there; lovely animals to observe.The monkey \"house\" and the other styled \"houses\" such as the buttefly and lizards were a brilliant concept. You get to walk through all these animals and be part of the enclosure it feels. In the monkey house they even had a squirrel creature which is apparently the same one from the film \"Ice Age\". Very cute as he scuttled around near your feet. There is so much to do here it is unbelievable, the zoo itself has alot of history and serves as a museum too. There's even a planetarium! This is certainly a place you come for a day trip but we only had 3 hours scheduled for the visit so had to jam pack everything in. We got in for 31 euros for the 2 of us, it's a fair price for the amount of things there! Some of the animals seemed to be in peculiar pens, i.e. the camels with reindeer and other horned animals, it seemed a peculiar collaboration but there must have been a reason. Likewise we did feel the lions were a little overcrowded but could only hope they had a wider enclosure round the back, they had nowhere to hide as around 30 people stared at them in one go."

Many animals (and the aquarium) are housed in classical Amsterdam-style buildings.The focus is on preserving species, meaning that this zoo doesn't try to have as many animals as possible but rather the most special animals. While space is limited by the city around it, Artis still offers a wealth of different animals. Everything from insects to elephants can be seen. Some building have seen better times, yet the animals are seem healthy and well taken care off. Sometimes cages are stuffed underneath bigger buildings are around shady corners, but discovering these special places makes Artis all the more fun.A final note: most signs and presentations are available in both English and Dutch.

Pretty quickly you become aware that the zoo was once a private mad man's collection of exotic beasts, kept in his garden in Amsterdam. There's certainly a wide and varied collection of creatures, but I did feel vaguely uncomfortable about the size of their \"pens\". Despite this, none of the animals looked unhappy, except the brown bear, and the zoo is very clean, and you do get to see the animals quite cleArly.

The pets behaved very natural and some didnt mind the attention too much.Their seals, lions and monkeys really made me smile out there.Couldnt find their bears ;)We went to their restaurant, it was hard to get a seat, and will call their selection, okay.

Initially it looked small from outside, but once you walk inside, it has lots of things to offer. Though I found a lot of enclosures vacant. We could not find Giraffe.

We originally decided on cycling, but kind of last minute chose the zoo. SO happy we did, this is a fantastic zoo and we've been to the San Diego, National and other zoos. By far you will get closer to animals here than anywhere else you have been. We were there over three hours and had to leave due to timed tickets to the Anne Frank House, but easily could have spent another two hours. EASILY.Get there around noon and you will catch a number of the feedings going on over the next two hours (12:40 the lizards were fed ;-) .The primate house was our first stop and really set the tone, we walked in and right above our heads were small and medium-sized animals running around - literally a couple of feet over ourheads! Very cool, and beautiful animals. The animals were very active - something we experienced all through the zoo. Little kids may be a bit scared as many of the animals really are roaming free - the peacock is not threatening, but the lemurs running around may scare youngsters (even though I saw no attempt of the animals to touch people).We happened to catch the lizards being fed which was amazing. Lizards don't usually move around a lot, but when you throw in a half dozen or so grasshoppers you will be amazed at how fast the can move. SO COOL! Ditto on the primate feeding. Lovely to see the animals really moving around, not just laying around.Rather than go through all the exhibits, let me just say that if you have kids or like zoo's, this is a great way to spend half a day or more. LOTS of benches so you can sit and watch the animals at your own pace - two huge dinosaurs the kids can actually climb on, next to a large grassy area great for a rest or a picnic. There are lots of food options all through the zoo so you can munch as you go (and lots of restrooms as well).Overall this is one of the best thought-out and arranged museums I've ever seen. Great photography options, too."

            "review": "Good zoo. Worth a visit for animal lovers.. I've been to the Singapore zoo and various zoos in the UK. I didn't expect to be wowed by this zoo but I was. And this is why. The exhibits are all beautifully planned and designed, and it truly is a beautiful and scenic zoo. I was surprised at seeing that the macaque and the huge animals (buffaloes?) were in enclosures that were not fenced at all. Just surrounded by a moat. Well it worked somehow. The animals never attempted to cross the moat and approach the human sightseers. The moats made the exhibits look very natural. Almost like we were standing right next to the animals in their habitats. And the moats also did well to stop people from disturbing the animals (like tapping or shaking the fencing - which happens in fenced animal enclosures in other zoos). There is a beautiful and quite extensive collection of aquatic animals in the zoo's Aquarium. It's very very nicely done. I really never expected to be wowed by it, having been to many Sealife centres in UK and the like... but I was. I truly recommend visiting the Aquarium.Other highlights include the wonderful Butterfly house. Truly one of the biggest I've seen so far and the ceiling is very very high (as it is an attempt to emulate a rainforest in the Amazon with the tall tall trees) so the butterflies have loads of room to fly about and hide. I was actually happy for them. Yes, we did not get swarms of exotic butterflies flying about and landing on our shoulders and heads like it normally happens in smaller butterfly enclosures with much lower roofs - so in a way, we saw fewer butterflies and those we saw often did fly at a distance from us. But at least they were not getting their wings torn or injured by visitors because there is lots of space for them to fly and escape and take a breather. And yes the high ceiling also means this butterfly enclosure isn't overly warm and stuffy and humid like many other butterfly houses we've been to. The climate inside this butterfly enclosure is just pleasant.There is a nice Insectarium building on site too. Not as many insects as some other places we've seen elsewhere. But the kids room is quite interesting for the kids - lots of nice interactive experimental fun which touch on insects.There are several cafes dotted around the zoo so you're never far from somewhere you can eat or drink at, though food is a bit pricey for what they are, as is typical of zoos.There is a beautiful scenic garden at the edge of the zoo too. With a pedestrian walkway/bridge over a large canal/waterway with boats on it, and lots of flowers in bloom. This being Amsterdam, it is truly a peaceful and tranquil haven away from the rush and bustle of the city centre. I sat on one of the benches along the water for a rest and I felt I could take a nap there. In the near distance, cars and pedestrians can be seen driving on city roads. So near yet so far. The other animal exhibits are also really nice and worth visiting. There are the requisite gorilla, lion, tiger and giraffe exhibits which every zoo worth it's salt will have.The Aviary section is also lovely. Lots of exotic birds to see - quite a good collection of them too.There are cute little wooden pushchairs for hire too, if you have toddlers who aren't good with walking. It does entail a lot of walking if you wish to see most of the exhibits in this zoo. My feet were really aching at the end of my visit. Entrance ticket prices are reasonable for zoos of this standard. For me and my 2 young daughters, it cost me about \u20ac50. Which is similar to what it costs to get in the London Zoo.All in all, a really nice zoo. There's something for everyone here. Whether for a child or an adult. It was truly a surprisingly charming zoo. As I've said, I've visited many zoos before and they are considered very nice zoos... but this one wowed me too. It is unique in it's own way and very well-designed. If you're in Amsterdam and you or a loved one is an animal lover, definitely worth visiting this place."

I read the reviews before deciding to go and read that it wasn't very good but WE LOVED IT! The zebra's, the lions, the snakes, crocodiles!It was a lovely sunny day as well so it was heaven!Since we were so late we didn't get to see any feedings except for the new elephants! They are such amazing creatures, we were in awe. The best thing about the zoo -- the animals are sooooooo close to you. I swear, the lions could probably jump out and touch you if they actually wanted to come closer.. all the enclosures are surrounded by moats.. must be very deep because none of the animals tried to get close to people.I've attached a few pictures of some of the animals.THIS ZOO IS A MUST SEE. If we do come back to Amsterdam, I will definitely want to spend the whole day here!!!!!!!!!!!! Best animals to see: Lions/Wolves/Elephants/Bear. Also go see the aquarium! Frickin' awesome!Negative aspect - I felt sorry for the Bear... It was lonely and kept pacing. I really don't think it's happy there.... There must be some way to make the enclosure bigger or maybe let him/her have a mate."

Didn't prebook tickets but maybe should have, spent about 20 minutes queing instead of walking straight in.Lots and lots to see- personal favourites were the butterfly encounter, seals and the aquarium. The tropical fish are just manginifcent!Tip- eat outside the very reasonably priced lunch restaurant and watch the zebras and giraffes roam in front of you.Great day out and no complaints!

Artis Zoo offers a great day out from the busy city - not only is it huge and you can definitely spend all day here but it also offers many little \"performances/tours\" during the day, e.g. feeding the seals. Also, I would always pay the 2\u20ac extra for the map of the Zoo as otherwise, you may feel a bit lost and forget to see many parts of the Zoo.I would further recommend to get to the Zoo as early as possible as this way, you will save a lot of time on queuing and are able to enjoy a lot of the animals without big crowds of people."

Amsterdam's Artis Zoo might not be on the top 10 of Animals Rights Activists in these days, where large natural scaped openair 'cages' sweep across the Zoos of Europe (and the world one imagine) - don't get me wrong, the animals seemed to do week, but the architecture does date back to the time, when the primary purpose of teh zoo was to display the animals in cages where they were easily spotted as they didn't have anywhere to run. But the zoo is extremely cozy with its very lush garden corridors and every building (also the new ones) have a beautiful design. The Aquarium is like stepping back in time with its greek goddess statue in the hallway and its classical architecture.When the rain broke out for an hour we went to the Planetarium, where they showed a IMAX movie about the universe which really fascinated the young ones (and the parents:-) - entrance was by the way included in the entrance fee to the Zoo.All in all a beautiful place to take a time out in the midst of the city."

There is plenty to see and wandering round slowly looking at the different animals was really pleasant. The aquarium was an amazing old building with some interesting displays, such as the one depicting an Amsterdam canal. The butterfly house is worth a visit - but be warned it is warm and humid in there. And penguin feeding time is something to behold - I think every heron within 20 miles had turned up seeking a prime position for a free meal should one of the fish intended for the penguins be dropped. Also on display when we visited was a 3-month old tapir.The zoo also has a restaurant, a cafe and a planetarium which gives shows at various times, none of which we used so I cannot comment on their quality.We bought iAmsterdam cards which include zoo admission."

All of the placards are in Dutch and English, which was great for understanding the animals. We unfortunately found a few animals to either not be on display or extremely elusive. We particularly enjoyed the the primates, they were very animated and playful. There are also some wild animals who occupy the zoo as well, including some adorable ducks and chicks which where wandering around near the zoo. The grounds are beautiful and well kept and most enclosures are spacious. I would have to say that London Zoo is marginally better but we thoroughly enjoyed Artis.

The first challenge was to find somewhere to park our bikes, not because there wasn't facilities, it's just that there were so many bikes. Any tree, fence, etc is fair game. There was a bit of a line up out the front, but this moved steadily and didn't take that long. The zoo is quite quirky, as with many things in Amsterdam. The Monkey House and Bird House are significant in regard to their architecture and the fact that the animals are not caged off from you. We happened to be there during feeding time, and the animals come to the feeding trays and are oblivious to the many visitors that were watching on. Great opportunity for photos!! I was taking a shot of a small monkey and the attendant tapped me on the shoulder to alert me to the fact that an iguana was approaching my left ear. It was great, very unique. Some of the enclosures were a bit on the small size (large cats) but they are undergoing extensive renovations to address this over the next 5 years. The gardens are beautiful, clean and well maintained, with plenty of lawn being ideal for a picnic or just to laze in the sun to give your feet a rest. The gardens are punctuated with various objects of art, that further enhance the settings. The aquarium was something else, make sure you go upstairs to the mammoth fish, they need to be seen to be believed. I enjoyed the chimps, the llamas, the vultures, giraffes, penguins and elephants. There is plenty of seating throughout the zoo and several cafes to purchase food and drinks. It is very easy to get to the zoo with the tram going right past. We thoroughly enjoyed our day here and would recommend it for everyone, no matter what age."

It was a toss up between paintings and animals, and to be honest we'd had enough of renaissance portraits. The zoo is in beautiful grounds, with a nice mix of city and garden architecture. The animals look really well cared for, and content, which is always good to see. The butterfly enclosure is mesmerising, and the lions drew a crowd. It's not cheap, at nearly 20 euros per person, and charging \u20ac2 for a map is a bit cheeky. It's still cheaper than London Zoo, however, and I'd say even better. The food is not the best, and not all outlets take Visa debit card, which was a bit strange."

Very close to the centre of Amsterdam... 35 acres of immaculately kept gardens to wander around and enjoy with the animals spread around the grounds. Never seems too cramped despite there probably being several thousand visitors there on the afternoon we spent.My wife is cat stupid...and to see an extremely rare Amur Leopard and a Black Panther were worth the admission fee alone.I personally am not a fan of zoo's... once you have been fortunate to see wild animals roaming free in their own environment it all seems rather sad.....did thing the cats could do with at least four times the space that they had assigned to them.....However, from an educational standpoint for children who otherwise may never have the chance to see these beautiful creatures, and especially regarding the excellent work zoos are doing in relation to critically endangered animals and ensuring their survival I am not going to knock the place.... much better than the majority of zoos and worth the admission fee of 20 Euros without a doubt.One tip..... take a picnic with you.... there are loads of places to stop and eat it...i Personally found the food in the zoo fairly standard fare and overpriced"

The Zoo is a little out of the City Centre, however this should not put you off as it is easy enough to find via the tram (number 9 or 14 from the centre of Amsterdam - about a 10 minute journey). Admission was free with the I Amsterdam card and there was very little queueing. The zoo is fairly large and we were amazed by how much there was to see all in the same place - as well as the usual animal enclosures, there was also an insect house, butterfly house, bird sanctuary, reptile house, small mammal house, farm yard, planetarium, aquarium and zoo museum. When we first entered the Zoo, we were also given the option of having our photo taken alongside the camels and buffaloes, which can then be collected for a fee of 8 Euros at the exit. On viewing the photograph, we decided we would buy as the photo was of good quality and it was a nice souvenir to take away.The layout is well thought out and there are plenty of places to eat and drink. There were a couple of small negatives which is why I have deducted one star from my overall rating. Firstly, the signs that accompany all of the animals are mainly in dutch and there are very little English translations. Secondly, the Zoo shop was very small for such a large Zoo and there was very little choice. However, these are only small gripes and did not take away from a fantastic day out."

You will get fairly close to the animals and there are a couple of areas where the animals (birds, lizards, small monkeys etc) will roam completely free among the visitors. The habitats for the big cats (lions etc) were in a bad shape an they had very small living areas compared to many other zoos. Luckily we catched the sealion feeding time which was a real laugh as the animals were well trained (animalkeeper was also there to answer questions afterwards). Generally speaking the selection and number of animals was disappointing compared to Vienna zoo for example, but Artis does have a limited space - they cannot expand as they're in the middle of the city - but it's not all about animals here though.If you get hungry the restraurants in the area offer snacks with reasonable prices and there are also mobile (bicycle) snack bars in the area. Entry fee is expensive, nearly \u20ac20 per person. However with the red Amsterdam tourist card entrance was free. A bit of a walk from central, so a tram takes you there more easily."

Actually being that close to the monkeys was amazing . The Lions there wear amazing and playful . Another highlight was the Chimpanzees I was fascinated by them and how simular they were to humans . This Zoo has an Aquairum, Planetarium , Reptile house , Tropical House , Birds House and butterfly house and that's just a few of the inside stuff there are hundreds of different animals outside like Elephants , giraffes , Sea Lions , Monkeys and loads of other animals .

We were glad that we did as we had a great time walking around the zoo all afternoon. There is a huge variety of animals and the enclosures are all of a good size so they seem comfortable. Being a nice sunny day the animals were all out making the most of it as well meaning they were easy to see. There must have been a lot of people there but it didn't seem that way and we had no trouble with crowds blocking our view at any point. A highlight was the forest walkthrough section where you are actually in with the monkeys, bats and iguanas. This was one of the most enjoyable things we did the whole time we were in Amsterdam and I highly recommend a visit!"

            "review": "Lovely zoo, but one with problems. This is a small, old zoo set in the heart of the city and is well worth a visit as it has many good qualities. The surroundings are beautiful and the architecture is well worth seeing, plus the zoo has made a great effort to make sure there are plenty of educational displays available to make the day out a learning experience.Parts of the zoo are spectacularly good, especially the areas dedicated to birds - the rare macaws, storks, spoonbills and pheasants had really nice, spacious enclosures and looked happy and clean. The aquarium is a must-see, with a huge range of fish in beautiful surroundings. One drawback of the aquarium as a wheelchair user was the fact that the tanks are quite high up, which meant craning my neck to see, and I wasn't able to see the bottom areas of the tanks because of the angle and the heavy wooden framing.The vulture flight area was also impressive, and having the huge birds fly over your head is a really great experience. The penguin pool is so good that it had attracted a lot of local herons, looking quite happy and obviously quite at home.On the downside the big cats were in really small, and totally unsuitable cages which were dark and provided very little stimulation or opportunities for exercise. The lions had almost no space to move around and looked very fed up, a lot of the smaller cats were showing disturbing repetitive pacing behaviour which was upsetting and quite unneccessary in these modern times when the stress caused by small enclosures is well understood. The wolves were in a very small, unadorned enclosure which gave them no opportunities to run or play and for such intelligent creatures must be desperately boring. I would much prefer to see this zoo specialise in the smaller animals so that they can give them the best possible enviroment, rather than keep large creatures in such small spaces. The butterfly house was definitely a highlight, accessible and really well kept, with beautiful butterflies and lovely plants, we could have happily stayed there much longer.Facilites in the park seemed good, but the wheelchair we borrowed was rather like a metal shopping trolley and very uncomfortable. It also had four small wheels which meant that I couldn't push myself and this meant that my companion had to push me the whole day, which wasn't ideal for either of us.There seemed to be quite a few places to eat, but by the time we got to the eating areas all the food was sold out and so we weren't able to try the local delicacies. We did have a nice icecream by the penguin pool earlier in the day though, which was great."

There are flamingos, penguins, gorillas, jaguar, giraffes, bear, chimpanzees, lion, and lots more.. There is also a planetarium and surrounded by old buildings that are so beautiful.. This is a place where u can easily spend half a day & still feel excited & not bored with it.. A good place to bring your kids & have a picnic in the park..

You can bring your own food and drink, but in the park there enough places to get something healthy and oke coffee. There are playgrounds for kids, so the adults can take a break. There are also lots of activities to do depending on the time of year. We recommend to visit Artis at night if you get the opportunity during the Night of Artis and in the summer they have varies of programma's at the end of the day.Artis a must see in Amsterdam."

It is a great mix of old and new buildings, in a parklike environment with beautiful flower arrangements. And animals. Progressively, the old cramped cages are being replaced by more open walk-through spaces. The new monkey exhibit and the butterfly garden are great. And you can still see lions, zebras, elephants. The selection of animals seems to have been reduced as a result of renovation, however the enjoyment increased. Tips: order tickets on-line, and allow yourself 4 hours at least. And check out the planetarium on a rainy day or when you need a rest."

The aquarium and the aviary were quite good and housed some really beautiful creatures. The aquarium has to be the best feature at Artis and any visitor should not miss it. The aviary and the penguin enclosure are also a muse-see. The zoo is quite large and requires quite a bit of walking. There should be more signs in the zoo to let people know what to see and where. Maybe it was because Artis was under renovation, but the zoo felt off colour. Good location to spend a day on a weekend for families with or without children, especially for the latter."

This is very much a traditional city centre zoo: the enclosures for the big animals, such as lions, elephants and bear were not big enough by modern standards. The walk through avery was very good with primates jumping amongst visitors.The planetarium is quite modern looking; however, the commentary is in Dutch with no headphones for translation so it is difficult to know what is going on: the other half used it as an hour for a snooze!"

Looking on the map it seemed to be quite small compared to some of the zoos I've been to in the last 5-10 years. It's safe to say that Artis Zoo exceeded my expectations with its wide assortment of animals. We ended up spending between 3-4 hours here and greatly enjoyed our experience. Some of the animals were either put away for the winter or not available due to renovations. The only real negative that I can find with the Artis Zoo is that the food wasn't very good, and I'd advise bringing your own food (not sure if allowed) or eating outside the zoo."

            "review": "We came away unhappy. We decided to visit Artis Zoo largely on the strength of the positive reviews on this site. I have to say, i'm a little mystified as to why this place has had so many positive reviews. Although there were elements of our visit that we enjoyed, we came away with some serious reservations about the welfare of the animals. Although the animals seemed to be in fairly good physical health, the enclosures are far too small in my opinion, one of the first exhibits we came upon was the wolves, there were about 20 wolves confined in a space no bigger than our two bedroom flat, the place was a quagmire of mud with nowhere dry for the wolves to sit. The wolves, although looking well fed and healthy, were definitely not happy, milling about and pacing the small space, their legs coated in muck. The stench of ammonia coming from the enclosure was appalling. Not a good early impression of Artis Zoo.After that we went to see the penguins, and it was the same story, perhaps 50 birds in a muddy space not much bigger than our living room, emanating waves of the stench of waste.There is an Amur Leapord at Artis Zoo, and while it was amazing to see such a rare and beautiful creature so close up, the experience was tainted by the habitat, a low, shallow glass fronted enclosure about 5-6 metres deep and maybe forty metres long.The worst of all by far was the Bear, having never seen a bear in the flesh before I was very excited to see it. We approached the enclosure, yes, you've guessed it, it was tiny. The bear itself was pacing around a small empty pool, it would do a full circle, raise itself up on its back legs, wave its front paws in the air, and go around the pool again, repeating this over and over, around and around. This animal had clearly lost it's mind.It was upsetting and traumatic to say the least, we didn't even want to take a picture and walked away from the poor stricken creature deeply saddened, I believe the kindest thing to do would be for somebody to put the damn thing down and end it's misery.Other than the small spaces the animals had to inhabit, there were other aspects of Artis Zoo that left us feeling a bit uncomfortable, such as the exhibits of dead specimins, I'm sorry, but I really don't want to see a load of dead stuffed birds and beetles and butterflies nailed to a board, or a pickled elephant foetus in a jar. Does anybody?We wandered on, many of the enclosures were empty and deserted, the reptile house was closed many of the animals listed on the website weren't there. No Lion to be seen, no Polar Bear, no Giraffes, no Armadillos, no Red Panda, no African Wild Dogs. We enjoyed seeing the feeding of the sea lions but the pool looked too small and very dirty, it was very nice to see these lively creatures doing their tricks for fish and I'm sure the keepers' talk was very interesting but since it was entirely in Dutch I'll never know. I know it is somewhat presumptuous to expect English to be spoken but most of the audience that turned up for the seal lion feeding clearly didn't understand what was being said.We tried to make the best of our day at Artis Zoo, it was lovely to see the gorillas, a silverback and a couple of females with a baby. The aquarium was also pretty good. Great to see the Oryx and some of the smaller animals too.However we came away troubled, this 19th Century Zoo is too small, archaic and in my opinion has no place in modern society. The size of the enclosures borders on cruelty, they should either reduce the number of exhibits and expand the size of the habitats, or close the place down.If you have children they'll have a great time, but for a thinking adult with a conscience, Artis Zoo is in general a negative experience. I wouldn't go again and would not recommend any of my friends visiting Amsterdam to do so."

It\u2019s a fairly big zoo with lots to see so I\u2019d allow (at an absolute minimum) 2 hours for your visit, but I\u2019ve spent 3-4 hours there on both occasions. There\u2019s several caf\u00e9s dotted around the zoo where food and drinks (especially when they have a captive market) are reasonably priced (info here: http://www.artis.nl/en/food-drink/restaurants/). There\u2019s all the \u2018big\u2019 animals that you\u2019d hope to see at a zoo but there\u2019s also some unexpected treats. For example, there\u2019s seals. Who on both of my trips here have been incredibly playful and fun to watch. There\u2019s some underwater viewing windows but you can also go above and see them from there. For the elephants, gorilla\u2019s and chimpanzees there\u2019s indoor viewing areas so if they are not outside you\u2019ll still be able to see them. If you\u2019re lucky the big cats will be out and prowling around, there\u2019s lions, a panther and a leopard amongst others. There\u2019s also a monster of a crocodile in the reptile house that has to be seen to be believed. Regardless of your age, don\u2019t miss out of the petting zoo. As you come in the main entrance you\u2019ll see the gift shop on your right hand side, the gate to get in is next to the shop. There were goats, sheep, calf\u2019s, chickens, rabbits, etc all running around. Great fun getting up close to the animals and having a few pictures taken with them, watch where you tread though!Couple of tips: Make sure if you are visiting that your camera\u2019s charged! You can also use the I amsterdam city card here. Finally, buy a map (it\u2019s in English) for 1.99 Euro. It\u2019s walkable from the centre, but you can get tram number 9 from Central Station or tram 14 from Dam Square to get there."

However there was a bird house which was a lovely section of large indoor enclosures all very well designed with the birds flying free enabling them to live an almost normal existence. The first section of the birdhouse had a rain forest feel to it with flora to match, you had to look closely but there were birds in the undergrowth,small little squirrel like creatures, iguana relaxed on long ropes, fruit bats were asleep on the roof and a variety of marmosets and other monkey species where happily grooming and swimming in the trees going about their normal behavior. I little ale monkey gathered apples and ate them not a feet away from me at compete eye level and seem completely unbothered by my starting in awe as its little fingers unpeeled the skin from the apple slice before being devoured :)...sooo cute. Other indoor sections was the insect and reptile houses amazing collections again all very well laid out, there is also an amazingly large aquarium which also has a little museum section in it, the aquarium itself has some breathtaking aquariums which have to be seen to be believed. I tend not to go to zoos in different countries as i find that perhaps the same standards of welfare are not in place as what would be expected in the UK, however i was extremely impressed with what i saw, many of the species had large indoor and outdoor section of their enclosures all animals seemed happy and healthy. There was also a planetarium in the zoo which we didn't get chance to see, they only do the shows in dutch though so that was a little disappointing. But overall excellent day out just make sure you go earlier in the winter periods as we didn't quite get to see all species of animals as it got dark. Great day out of you have kids as there is a little play area for them as well. It costs 19 euro 50 cents each plus 1 euro 99 cents if you want a map. Which is extremely cheap when you look at the prices to go into a uk based zoo. And i have payed more than that to go into an aquarium by itself!! Highly recommend excellent value and time well spent, easy to get to as well from central station just get the no 9 tram."

(also buy a map at the ticket counter it is really helpful) The zoo is set right in the city which is convenient and easy to get to, both tram 9 from central station and tram 14 from Dam Square stop close to the zoo. The location is beautiful with historical buildings, flower gardens, a planetarium and an aquarium, we spent half a day exploring the zoo and had a great time."

We went in November '12 when it was quiet (but a few of the different restaurants inside advise that they are closed during the colder weather) and we found it a really lovely zoo that had a lot to see! The butterfly house & aquarium were also really good. My younger son loved the children's petting zoo. There were only a couple of enclosures that looked like they could have been a bit bigger but I have definitely seen worse. The area where there is a the main big restaurant and a large play area near the giraffes and large birds of prey was great in our opinion. Our kids loved climbing the huge structure! The restaurant was also fantastic. I know if we went to Amsterdam again my kids would be definitely asking to go back there!!"

This zoo pack more into it than I expected as it was in the centre of Amsterdam.Great collection of paired animals that seem to be happy as have cubs (tigers, elephant, wolf, penguin to name a few that I can remember).On the downside some of the enclosures are tiny. A puma in a cage not bigger than 10ft by 10ft and an adult elephant that steps from side to side as if mad or totally bored of its environment but this animal may well have came to the zoo like this. If you visit the zoo do intend to spend at least 4 to 5 hours as you will be surprised at how much time it takes to walk round especially when you visit the aquarium which israther good as well."

We especially liked the butterfly house and the bird house, where the birds are free to roam the building.It's also possible to get food in the zoo at reasonable prices, including the local pancakes which come in a little tray with powdered sugar. The zoo mascot, Artis de Partis, is a sock monkey who appears on all instructional signs, making them easy to see, and lending a sense of fun! You can buy him in the shop too!"

Big cats and crocodiles unmissable; displayed so well so that it encourages 'natural' behaviour which is missing from so many zoos. Lots of landscaped space to walk and picnic. Aquarium a bit cramped into its Victorian building but the rest was well worth the Euro 14 entry fee.On 9 tram route from Centraal Station."

What sets this zoo apart is the access you will have to a wide array of animals spanning several continents. Each exhibition allows you an up-close look and the animals were all out and about which made the viewing all the more enjoyable. The layout made it very easy to spend a half day at the zoo and capture all it had to offer. Another benefit is we were able to take the tram from downtown to the zoo for less than 2 euro each and the kids ride free. My niece is a zoo fanatic and she is still talking about the zoo upon our return home. A true highlight for all of us. If you are traveling to Amsterdam with children do make this a stop on your trip. They even have a nice gift shop that did not break the bank to purchase a little gift for the kids. The price is reasonable with the kids in free and 25 euro a piece for the adults. The zoo offers animal viewing and has wonderfully placed parks within the zoo for the young ones. Lastly, the food was great for a zoo and our lunch was affordable- not something we are used to at attractions in the U.S."

My grandchildren and I went to Artis in Amsterdam, we wanted to have a nice day out in Amsterdam and for the children the Zoo was on the top of their list. The Zoo is at the edge of the old center, it has a big parking (which is much cheaper than any other parking in Amsterdam) and there is one entrance, where we had to wait about 10 minutes due to a queue. My grandchildren wanted to see the flamingos and from there we passed the other birds (which have just been put in new enclosures) and went straight for the aquarium which is smaller/ also different than the Oceanium at Blijdorp Zoo. The Zoo is not that big, but has a lot of variety in animals... for us the highlights were the seals, the butterflies, the Savannah, lemur island and the young lion. We ate poffertjes, there are several places where you can eat, there is also a playground next to the Savannah.The Zoo is old, they are in the middle of renewing all enclosures, but the biggest project still needs to start and to be honest this is also the most important project. All big cats are now living in old and small enclosures, on one hand this is nice as you can see all that is happening (well that goes for the lions, the others have green areas in their enclosures which make them invisible now and then), but this is no longer how Zoo's (should) display their animals. So the Zoo would be even better once all of this is done and then it will be a really good Zoo.Now we just had a few hours of good fun."

The more noise there is, the more the animals hide. Not only that, but the lines are incredebily long at noon. When we left the start of the line was literally 100m before the main entrance on the street!Just after opening, with no one there, we got really close to the animals in The Monkey House, which was a pretty unique experience. Be sure to get there using public transport, it's a big place and our feet were already tired from the walk. What also helps is mapping out a general route, passing everything you really want to see. Ours took about 3 hours, after which we were tired and hungry, so we left to get some food. If you want it's perfectly possible to spend an entire day there, which would justify the expense a bit more because it isn't cheap (\u20ac18.5pp)."

It is a lovely walk around in what feels open air. It is expensive if paying in but one of the most advantageous aspects of the I-amsterdam card. Food is relatively expensive- which is to be expected in a zoo. We had a pleasant picnic in one of the many gardens. I gave it four stars because many animals were noticably missing from quite early afternoon- we didn't see elephants, giraffes or some other species. The aquarium is fascinating and enjoyable."

The zoo is well worth the visit - healthy and happy looking animals in a very beautiful garden.i would say the zoo is a great place to take a picnic if you have young children - lots of attractive picnic areas and some grassy areas you can sit on - as they could run around without falling in a canal in the time it takes you to open the picnic box. The small area where you can stroke goats and sheep was fun as was the seal 'show' (the keeper talking and playing with the animals). Highly entertaining the porcupine you meet on the way in and the prairie dogs - it was quite obvious they were looking at us looking at them!! :-). If you don't want to take a picnic, there is a reasonably priced caf\u00e9 near the entrance with a pleasant terrace overlooking a small, lake there for flamingo. We both (middle aged mum and teenage son) enjoyed the experience of walking through the butterfly hall and having exotic butterflies fly around us. We were lucky enough to visit the zoo in hot, sunny weather but I think that even in the rain it would be a pleasure. It is also obviously a place where Dutch people go for a day out - it was the only place where for 3 hours I didn't hear anyone speak English or Italian (or anything other than Dutch, come to that) - which was nice!"

There is much to learn for children. The zoo is good for one day entertainment, but to see it all it will take a hole day. The zoo is renovating so there is changing a lot and the new habitats are wonderfull. Now you can walk between the 'ringstaart monkeys'! For the tourist a perfect place to be and also when it rains.

The last thing you want to see is animals in enclosures that are too small. We were also hesitant because of the price. 18.95 Euros is an expensive bit of fun for one adult, but 15.95 Euros for children aged 3-9 is a bit ridiculous!We arrived an hour and a half before closing time on a Sunday afternoon. There weren't too many people, but owing to the late hour and the size of the zoo that wasn't too surprising.The zoo itself is rather large which is hopefully a blessing when there are large amounts of people. With some of the usual features (petting zoo, reptile house, big cat enclosure) it also has some unusual ones including a planetarium, aquarium, zoological museum, and butterfly pavilion. It would seem that there is something to do no matter what the weather. It's designed to please everyone and should certainly keep everyone entertained no matter what their age.Wandering the zoo is like navigating a park. Pleasant and shady walkways lead all over the zoo allowing you to take different paths to each enclosure. There are well-maintained toilets at regular intervals and several food kiosks and restaurants throughout the zoo.The animal's enclosures weren't massive, but they also weren't tiny as some of the reviews here detail. Perhaps some work has been done in the meantime. Generally they were kept up. The penguins were a bit smelly (the water in their enclosure didn't look very clean) but otherwise we didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. There were however a lot of dead rodents in the Vulture enclosure. It didn't appear to be feeding time, and the Vultures didn't look so interested so the result was rather macabre.The ibexes however were pretty cool. Their enclosure is modeled to look like a mountain and they seemed to very much enjoy clambering around in it. We also really enjoyed the peacocks which appear to roam around the zoo freely. We were even treated to a show as the male tried to woo the female!The aquarium was not as large as we expected but very well kept. The tanks were pristine and the selection of fish was rather large. The petting zoo was pleasantly large and had all the usual animals along with a few cows and a slightly grumpier pig.As a couple who love animals it was a pleasant way to spend our last afternoon in Amsterdam. We were pleased with what we saw in an hour and a half but I imagine you could easily spend several more hours checking out other areas of the zoo. Despite the zoo closing at 18:00, we managed to wander back to the gates and leave around 18:30 without anyone reminding us that they closed at 18:00.The gift shop was lovely. Would have loved to buy one of the beautiful calendars but at 15 Euros it seemed a bit excessive. I should also add that unless you have one of the touristy free gift coupons that you also have to pay 2 euros for a map at the entrance!Overall, we enjoyed it, but the price of admission certainly isn't for the faint of heart, especially if you happen to be students or a young family with limited funds. We didn't eat there so I can't say whether the food was reasonably priced or not. Those on a budget should consider carefully if it's worth it for them."

The fee is average - 18.50\u20ac, Jacksonville is ~$20 so comparable. The zoo was surprisingly well stocked and had a lot of interesting animals. I was able to get closer to the animals here than any other zoo I'be been to. And none of the cages looked undersized or anything. Everything was compact but well-done, which seems to be how a lot of things are in Holland. The zoo also borders a large canal and there was a nice breeze this afternoon, maybe mid 60s.

The animals are well looked after and as a hobbyist photographer I always end up with some nice shots. Pay attention to the feeding times and take the chance to chat with the zookeepers. They have great stories about the animals. The new indoor spaces with free roaming animals are very exciting as well. Reserve enough time or accept that you will not see everything: even though it's not that big on the map, you will easily spend 3-5 hours here.If you think you will visit more than once in a year, I highly recommend buying the membership. It'll turn out to be a better deal."

Some of the cages look like they haven't been cleaned in months, and the size of the living compartments for the animals is disheartening. I watched a leopard just pace back and forth from one end to the other, living alone in such an isolated environment is bound to drive a creature crazy.

Unsurprisingly there was a queue of families waiting to go in but it only took about 10 mins or so to get our tickets. Maps are an additional 1.99e which is a little bit cheeky after paying admission as I'd say you do need a map to ensure you see everything. Hopefully I managed to 'pay it forward' when we left by leaving our map on a bench for someone else to use.It took us about 2.5hrs of wandering to see the whole zoo and some areas we didn't spend long in; the butterfly house, as on one of the hottest days of the year so far it was waaaay to warm in there to be bearable and also the aquarium which looked great but someone was allowing three small children to run around screaming at full volume which didn't make for peaceful viewing of our aquatic friends.There was a large number of young or newly born animals (gorillas, lions, elephant, wolves) on display too which pays credit to the zoo's breeding programme. All other animals seemed to be in good condition and in well kept enclosures. The whole place was very clean and tidy, probably a benefit of it not being huge.Definitely worth a trip!"

The tropical houses which allow birds small monkeys lizards butterflys to be as natural as any enclosed animal can be and allowed close interaction with the animals. Many of the outside enclosures allowed the smaller animals and birds a large degree of freedom and the aquarium was very good. Now the bad. A brown bear which although having an enclosure walked round a concrete pad stood on its back legs turned fully round one way then turned round fully the other before repeating the walk round the pad and the turning round over and over and again. So sad to look at that a large mammal has been reduced to insanity. How can a first nation zoo allow this to be done to an animal. Pictures of animals behaving like this came out of the communist countries after the collapse of their dictatorships. The other large animals had small enclosures and either sat there in a listless fashion or showed signs of the same stress behaviour as the bear but to a lesser degree"

The use of space and the range of animals and the enclosurers were very well done and I would recommend it to anyone."

I would like to say that myself, aged 53 yrs and my daughter aged 25 yrs thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Artis zoo.I took my daughter to Amsterdam for 3 days, I had been before and wanted to show her all the sights that I have enjoyed in past visits , but she saw an advert for the zoo and fancied seeing it. We walked from the centre of Amsterdam. It only took about 20 minutes to walk it from Neumarket. The entry price was reasonable and my first impression of the enclosures was .. wow!. The animals seemed so close and the first enclosure had no bars or anything to spoil photos. There were herons nesting in trees and flying freely around the park. Most of the animals were close enough to see and photograph without difficulty. It was big enough to take up a whole afternoon but small enough to be able to relax with a drink or ice cream and not be tired of walking around. I was disappointed the the red pandas were not there as they were altering their enclosure, and the polar bears must have gone since the 2003 guide book we were reading but there were meerkats, elephants and baby, giraffes, zebras, birds of prey, big cats, brown bear, butterflys, camels, ant eater and many more... The butterfly house was amazing. My daughter loves butterflies and we haven't seen a butterfly display this good near home.We had a lovely time there and I will take my husband there the next time we visit as I'm sure he will love it too."

The gorillas were a highlight, along with the butterfly house and aquarium. I agree with other reviewers about the small size of the cages for the big cats, this I felt was the only negative thing about the zoo. I had a baguette and drinks in the cafe, reasonably priced for a tourist attraction. There were very few other people there on the day we visited, mostly young Dutch families. Not sure if this was because of the weather or the Easter holiday.Our family enjoyed it greatly, I think the kids could have spent all afternoon watching the gorillas (and we enjoyed pointing out the similarities between our kids behaviour and the young gorillas!)"

Myself and my boyfriend are instinctively very cautious about any type of zoos as we love animals and can't bare to see them distressed or unhappy in their surroundings and we certainly don't want to help fund these places by paying the admin fees. We took a chance at Artis Zoo and although we were happy to see the majority of animals looking cared for we were a bit disturbed at the size of the enclosures for some of the animals animals. The lion enclosure, for instance, was completely inadequate for the one lion, two lionesses and one young lion that it housed. The older male was constantly pacing back and forth while the others followed his lead and they all looked very bored and unhappy. We moved on to the elephant enclosure and, although that was much bigger in comparison, it still seemed far too small for all the elephants that were in there - one was stood for what seemed like ages rocking backwards and forwards and it was quite upsetting to see, especially as lots of Dutch families were cooing over the baby elephant yet seemed completely unaware of this beautiful adult that was clearly miserable.One of the worse sights for us was another large cat pacing back and forth in a caged space around 4 feet long, like he was trying to wear a trench in the soil beneath him. It was extremely sad to witness and made us feel sick. The zoo itself is large and there are many things for families and couples to see and do, the aquarium and amphibian section was a particular favorite but on the whole I wouldn't recommend this zoo to any of my animal loving friends as I know they would be as distressed as we were. I'm also taking into account that it was a chilly February day when we went but even that couldn't mistake a zoo that looks very run down and wholly inadequate to cater for the animals it houses.We're used to visiting places such as 'The South Lakes Wild Animal Park' in Cumbria where the enclosures are huge and the animals have such freedom you leave feeling totally at peace with the standard of their care and housing.We definitely won't be going back to the zoo but we genuinely hope that the money Artis reaps from the entrance fees will go towards better care for these beautiful creatures that quite simply deserve better."

I asked about the elefant area at the entrance as they were my main interest. They got a baby elefant in july which i thought to be huge (both in matter and size) but the otherwise really helpful guy at the desk was totally surprised that knew about it! That really surprised me...The areas are (as far as i can judge) quite modern and spacey except of the wild cats which had a tiny cage outside living alone. The ape area was nice as well, but a little crouded i thought. The big aquarium house was interesting but missed some feel - touch - do it your self experience. That was actually my whole experience. Very nice to look at and good walking path as well as way finders but no \"wow \". They were no possibilities to feel or touch any animals or get really close to them. I am not talking about taming them but the did not seem to be interested in the few visitors at all. But Mumba was cool though they were no things with him at the store :-("

The enclosure was indoor and while my husband and I were enjoying the rest of the zoo, walking into this enclosure gave us the 'wow' factor. We spent about 45 minutes watching the gorillas and even saw the big male chase down one of the females and pound his chest. Wow! The rest of the zoo was OK. We were fortunate to be there on a nice day and enjoyed ourselves. All the enclosures are well kept and the animals seem to be well cared for. The food was OK; we were there during the off-season so we didn't have many choices. But definitely try some of the Dutch poffertjes (mini pancakes). The staff were exceptionally friendly.

Would certainly recommend as a result if visiting Amsterdam to get the Card!We Visited the Zoo 2 years ago, and In fact not too much has changed since that time. It was unfortunately raining lightly when we visited, but there are a number of indoor areas so that wasn't too much of a problem.The Usual Suspects are on display, There was an unusual Monkey 'Pyramid' with small Baboons? Clambering over it.The Chimpanzee had quite a few friendly Chimps. In fact 2 were getting, em, overly friendly? with each other!The Butterfly house had a number of colourful Butterflies flitting about. The aquarium was actually better than I expected. I'm not a big 'fish' fan but the tanks were well displayed and had a good selection of wildlife on display.I have mixed views about the bear enclosure. The bear was roaming about, but as with most big animals in captivity, seemed less than happy.The Lion enclosure was a different story though, a happy pride of lions with a 'teenage' cub causing chaos. Certainly memorable.The monkey house has most of the smaller monkeys indoors. I managed to annoy the staff as I stood on what appeared to be a poured concrete path to get a better view. It seems it was actually a fountain. Oops! Perhaps someone should tell them fountains usually have water though!We ate in the 2 Cheetahs cafe. Very nice food. And just before leaving had a Coffee in the Cafe by the entrance, again nice.We didn't try the Planetarium this time, due to time constraints, but in half a day covered most of the Zoo.Worth a visit certainly, but check what offers are available first!"

I have always been intrigued to go here since there seemed to have been a lot of animal births in 2011. In fact, if you travel by Schiphol, you won't fail to notice the huge Artis Zoo poster advert of an elephant fetus waiting to be born at the baggage claim area!The zoo is an excellent place to spend the day if you have children bursting with energy! Artis Zoo is small enough to see in a day, the opening hours are very kind to parents who need to find an activity from 9am onwards. In the summer, the zoo stays open till sunset (on other days only until 5pm).Definitely plenty to see and enjoy outdoors: camels, elephants, vultures, mountain goats, primates, birds, giraffes, big cats. Indoors, you have the aquarium, the seals underwater, the butterflies, the insectarium and the reptilium. I also found that the Artis Zoo is very kind to families who chance upon inclement weather during their visit. There is enough roofed attractions to still enjoy the zoo even if it's too cold or raining.Compared to other family attractions in the Netherlands, the food in eating establishments in the zoo (the Planetarium cafe and the the Two Cheetahs) were decent. The Planetarium cafe is right by the entrance serving simple sandwiches, however, if you want something heftier, head straight to the Two Cheetahs near the children's playground. You can let the children burn some energy during/after the meal break.Last but not the least, this is no tourist trap. I am glad that I did not spend a single cent during my visit on a useless souvenir :0). So this one is great as well for those on a budget. Be aware though, the entrance fee is 18\u20ac+ for adults and 15\u20ac for children 4 and over. Consider going as a group if you prefer to pay less!Have fun!"

This is because the animals are kept closer together than in any other zoo I've ever seen. The result is: you walk less and see more animals than anywhere else. Very convenient for kids, for the elderly, or anyone else who does not enjoy those very long walks you are required to do just to go between the lions and the apes (not to mention all other animals in the place."

But there are trams that take you literally right to the zoo, i believe they are trams 9 and 14, if I remember correctly.The zoo didn't have no grand sign or entrance so I found it simpy y following the people. I personally thought that the cost of the ticket was very high at 18.95 euros for a normal tourist. Plus 1.99 euros if you want a map of the zoo. I would recommend the map as it is quite a large maze like zoo and I missed out on seeing some animals, definitely the baby elephant.I haven't visited many zoo's so cant really compare this to others. The Artis zoo did have a large variety of animals, sea life and insects. As a solo traveller I spent 5 hours very easily at the zoo, so if you have young children I would allow more time. I found that most of the animals were very sedentary so I didn't really get to see much. But they have a good selection from giraffes, to bears, to jaguars to monkeys.The aquarium was decent, nothing special if you have been to an aquarium before, and definitely nothing compared to the amazing Barcelona aquarium, butstill worth a visit.The parts I found really impressive were the gorilla enclosure, the gorillas are really active and put on a great show. Also the butterfly enclosure was pretty cool, as you have all these colourful butterflies flapping away right next to you if not on you. I don't know what a planetarium has to do with a zoo, but this zoo has one and being the first time for me in a planetarium I absolutely loved it.Overall, it is a bit pricey, but i'ts something different from the usual Amsterdam, which is museums, girls and weed, this is something the whole family can enjoy. After strolling through the whole zoo, visit the planetarium right at the end as you get to lie down and watch the show, so an awesome way to rest too!"

If you want to enjoy this zoo though, make sure you go early in the day as there is quiet a lot of it to see, including the various animal houses. A lizard in the reptile house escaped while we were there and I loved that. I thought it was a nice touch by the lizard to make my experience unique. We told the zoo keepers and they turned up swiftly and returned him to his home. "

We have seen Zoo's with smaller cages where the animals looked in much worse conditions than this one. The Zoo has a small parc with statues where you can sit and also another area next to the canal.. ideal to sit on the terrace and eat and drink something.

The Aquarium was fascinating, really well laid out with plenty to see, I was really impressed (there is a lift for wheelchair users to access the 2nd floor). The Butterfly house was stunning, got some fantastic close up photos of some beautiful butterflies, well worth going into. Plenty of other animals to see close up too, Monkeys, Elephants, Lions, Giraffes, Zebras, Seals, the list goes on!. There seemed to be plenty of kids activities too if you are taking your kids to the zoo. Nice clean toilets dotted around the park for visitors. All in all I would highly recommend a visit here when in Amsterdam, and I was quite surprised to see that the zoo didnt rate higher on Tripadvisor"

I love animals and would nor of stayed of the zoo was not up to spec, but it was more than I could ever imagine. They are currently in the process of making the zoo even bigger and are enlarging the areas further.It was a great day out, prices for food etc are not cheap like most zoos but they encourage you to take a picnic and there is plenty of seating all over the zoo.If you have young children there are little pull carts for your child to use so it makes it fun for the whole family.The trip to Artiz was the highlight of our holiday and will be going back for sure."

I am NOT a massive animal lover by any means, but in my opinion, many enclosures \u2013 particularly the \u2018big cats\u2019 and the bears \u2013 appear quite small and cramped, and some of the animals don\u2019t do much other than pace back and forth constantly. We also saw a penguin that was quite clearly injured (looked like a broken wing), lying around looking quite forlorn and sad.  Many of the animals didn\u2019t come \u2018out\u2019 so that they could be seen, but instead hidden away in their \u2018bed\u2019 areas, and the majority of the bird enclosures were quite literally totally empty.Added to that, the zoo is rather dilapidated, with large enclosures containing no animals at all, a lot of footpaths cordoned off, and staff very thin on the ground. Sad for the animals living in poor conditions, and also quite boring even looking at the animals that appeared to be better housed.Quite a sad sight in a major city like Amsterdam \u2013 would not visit again."

Their enclosures are kept clean and they appear to have activitied available that suit their needs. It's designed with smaller people in mind, with viewing platforms at children height or glass sections where children can see into the enclosures. There are small trolleys that you can pay Euro 2 for and wheel the kids around in when their little feet get tired, so no need to take a pushchair (obviously for babies these wouldn't be recommended).There is a climbing frame for older children near one of the many restaurants and there is a fantastic butterfly enclosure which you can walk through and experience breathtaking butterflies, some even landing on people.All in all I would recommend the zoo."

I would prefer to see all animals walking in the wild, but the problem is we cant all afford to see them there, so then a zoo is an alternative. As for Artis Some animals do need new housing, basically this pnly goes for the big cats, but in the Zoo's defense i must say they are working on it, it is improving bit by bit (as I love big cat's i do however hope that they will move ahead soon). Having seen zoo's in Africa, Asia, North America and other parts I have seen better and i have seen worse. A Zoo in the centre of Amsterdam doesn't have as much space as for instance the Bronx Zoo, still the living conditions are much better than those of the Zoo in Antwerp... I enjoy it, but i do have to say in Holland there are bigger and in that sense better Zoo's. Overall it is an enjoyable afternoon and most animals do not seem stressed or limited by the space that they have.If you like animals, but do except that some are kept in enclosures (Zoo's) then you'll enjoy Artis. If you want wild animals to walk free don't go to any zoo!.If you prefer to see bigger Zoo's with bigger enclosures you can best go to the Zoo's in Arnhem, Rotterdam (also still bussy with improvements) or Hilvarenbeek."

All the others have been in the U.S. I was surprised at how close you can get to some of the animals! They had a lot of animals I had never seen before. The aquarium and insect area were extra perks. If you have kids they are guaranteed to be entertained here! There is more than one play area for kids, other interactive activities, places to sit, more than one restaurant, etc.The tanks in the aquarium were overall clean from what I had seen. It clean, the staff were friendly, and the landscape was beautiful. Just wish we would have gotten a map free considering the price we paid! All of the signs were in English as well as Dutch so that was helpful. I would recommend it to others."

We were near the Zoo in July 2010 on a Saturday afternoon expecting it to close at 6pm but on asking found it is open until 10pm on summer Saturdays. And we are glad we stumbled upon this gem!!!There is a summer programme of special events such as music, however many Amsterdam familes had brought picnics simply to sit in the green spaces and chat and chill outOne of the highlights is the Acquarium which is a sprawling grand old building with massive tanks showcasing exotic and fascinating specimensWhat really impressed us was that most of the animals were animated, unlike some Zoos where they are bored or asleep. There was a high amount of mating activity which fascinated our son!!! Best of all were the Giraffes - I have never seen a baby giraffe run round playfully - and the Elephants where the male and female were passionately nuzzling each otherWe were getting a bit hungry seeing all the Dutch familes tucking into their picknics and stumbled across the main cafe where an enthusiastic guy made us fresh filled baguettes - one ham one smoked salmon which we washed down with chilled beers, all at an reasonable priceThe entrance charge was about 50Euros for 2 adults and a child and was one of the most memorable things we saw in Amsterdam"

I would say going to this zoo would be more of an all day visit as when you are walking about the zoo you will end up getting sore feet if you don't take breaks. But the terrain is so much better than Edinburgh zoo as it is situated on a hill so walking anywhere in Edinburgh zoo is a trek. I like to see aquariums so seeing the aquarium and zoological musuem was a treat. I liked walking into the zoo where you were greeted by camels and donkeys. When you walk further in you get to see all sorts of animals. I thought seeing the vultures were great as when we got to them they were feeding, so seeing the vultures feeding on what I thought was a bird. Overall, great variety of animals.Definately bring a camera, water and comfortable shoes."

Only to find out the people who say its worth the visit, is either just hype, or they walked in with their eyes closed!! From start to finish was very very upsetting for me, to the point im actual hurt and traumatized from what i had seen. Firstly it IS expensive for what you get,...and what you get is quite upsetting. The cages/ space is waay too small. Especially for the lions and elephants that i saw there. Every animal i came across looked bored, so bored with their surrounding they almost looked like they were boarding on derangement, evidence of this was the lions walking up and down back and forth actually looking very sad and low because they had no activities to do, or enough space to do them in, so what else could they do in that tight space. One white wolf i saw was all alone and very sad, i could tell because it was actually whining non stop,.. aint they suppose to be in herds! More shocking was the elephants being so bored they were actually swaying from side to side, not in a playful way, more in a mesmerized demented way. Never in my years of going zoos have i seen anything like this. It really upset me. I think its time for the zoo to release these animals, because its obvious their not offering a good enough service to these animals, only just keeping them based more on entertainment values than anything else. ...What do i think?.....Anyone who goes here will be shocked, distraught (if they really do care for animals well-being like i do) and disappointed, and to be honest this place needs to be reported. (Plus i have evidence on my camera of this sad trip there)."

            "review": "One word: Pass. This is not an animal rights commentary. Rather, from a tourist perspective I thought the entire complex was overpriced and underwhleming. Two dots instead of one for the half-decent aquarium. Let's start with the price: 2 adults and 1 child (age 10) for 52 Euros (appx $80 USD at the time we were there). Granted it was January so one can't expect a nice spring walk, but it had snowed the night before (just a coating to make slush) and the property is not staffed, or bothers to clean the walks. If you are open all year, I don't think it's unreasonable to clean the walks for your guests so they don't slip and parents with strollers don't have to struggle.Website advertised tours in English each Sunday at 11 AM. Not only was there no tour in English, this was the only place I've been to in the Netherlands where I received a look of nationalistic disgust when I asked about a tour in English.Planetarium ok: commentary in Dutch only which one can't fault them on--you can't exactly subtitle other languages in a planetarium. Aforementioned aquarium is brief but decent.Save your money if you are a tourist. Reminds me of one of those places in the US that kids go to on a field trip as a \"throw away\" day for the teacher."

In this day and age, when we know that animals are not unthinking, unfeeling beings, it is particularly disturbing that in a cosmopolitan city like Amsterdam, there are big cats still in small cages. Yes, there is some attempt at enrichment via trees and grass in the cages, but it is still unacceptably small and heartbreaking. Another generation of children will grow up thinking this is OK because their parents take them there and of course if the parents think this OK, their kids will too. If these animals are to give their lives for our education then the least we can do is make their lives as best as possible. Shame on Amsterdam a city I happen to love and with so much else to offer. Stay away if you have any love for animals."

All of the enclosures were much too small for the animals. I feel that the staff in charge need to travel the world and visit other zoos to see how animals should be housed. For instance, the zoo closest to my home is Brookfield Zoo in Brookfield Illinois right outside of Chicago.(USA) At least there you could see the attempt is being made to allow the animals proper housing. Overall the staff at this zoo were very helpful and pleasant, but the enclosures need to be larger. I feel they need to close the zoo down and enlarge the area. Whatever it takes, afterall, it is about these creatures."

Birds in cages that are too small to permit fight!The enclosures for the reptiles are strewn with faeces.The final straw was the Polar Bear, small dirty pit, with barely enough water for it too stand in, let alone swim. This was a pittyfull and upsetting sight. We stopped here and left.Please don't visit this Zoo, if you do, you are encouraging animal suffering. Don't submit your Children as I did, to these horrific sights.In this day and age no animal deserves to suffer, Uk Zoo's and Safari Parks would never get away with conditions like these."

I visited artis zoo last week with my family and after walking the entire length of amsterdam thought that it was gonna be fab, on first impression as we walked into the zoo it seemed nice enough as there is a very nice entrance, that's about it! The animal enclosures were very small, there were six lions in an enclosure that can.t have been much bigger than my living room with very little shade and they looked bored out of their minds. As we walked around it became apparant the this was becoming a familiar sight with most of the animals, the sea lion tank was very small and must have had at least six inches of something growing on the bottom it was disgusting even my seven year old daughter noticed how bad that was, we had only been in the zoo for about an hour and a half by the time we got to the polar bear and i was very excited to see it because they are very difficult to keep in captivity as is well known , when I saw her it broke my heart, she was in a old style victorian enclosure where you look down on her, she had very little water, it was stinking, she was under nourished and she just paced from side to side with the sun in her eyes looking totally mad! I'm not a major animal welfare freak (no offence) but this really upset me and i feel that they should be shut down, who on earth governs the welfare of these poor animals? Are they blind? I really think my 54 euros for us to go in could be put to better use than blatent animal cruelty! You would never see that kind of care in a well run british zoo!"

Some of the animals, Polar bear and Hippo in particular were in a confined area and the poor polar bear was pacing up and down, looking very bored.

As in previous comments, the polar bear was a heartbreaking sight. Just lying on top of brown soil / wood chips etc. Is that really what the Arctic looks like? The hippo was housed in a concrete tank that was only just larger than he was. The aquarium was dingy and the fish tanks just looked dirty. Our overall feeling was that the zoo was definitely showing its age and seemed very neglected. It was hard to feel that the animals were enjoying their enclosures, as they bore no resemblance to their natural habitats. Surely it would be in both the best interest of the animals, as well as that of the visiting public for the facilities to be upgraded. I appreciate the zoo is in the middle of a city, but it is not a positive experience to see animals cramped in old, dingy, concrete enclosures, as the last thing they seem to be is happy."
