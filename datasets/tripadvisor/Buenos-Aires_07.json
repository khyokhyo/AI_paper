We were really excited about staying in this area- We stayed at an amazing hotel but quickly found that we missed Palermo, where we had stayed the previous three nights. Recoleta is boring comparatively. The shopping is not as good, the restaurants serve all the same food and it is really more of a one day thing instead of stretching it over a few like we did. The indoor mall was nothing special and the cemetery was not nearly as cool as the ones I've seen in Prague, Vienna and New Orleans."

Wandering aimlessly through Recoleta's city of the dead, I quickly started to wonder why we'd come here.Marked as one of Buenos Aires top attractions, the Recoleta's is packed with history (very little of which will reveal itself to you without a knowledgeable guide). Navigating your way round is not straightforward (if you are seeking out certain tombs you'll need to know beforehand which direction to head).This is one of Buenos Aires' peculiarities for tourists in a city that is not overburdened with landmarks. Nevertheless, it is somewhere that should be left to the dead and their families for all but the most informed and inquisitive of visitors."

Many restaurants and bars line the streets on all sides around the cemetery. Weekends the area is alive with people enjoying the food and music. The food selection will suit all palates. Fun place and especially safe. Buenos Aires comes alive in the evenings and weekends. The 'portenos' (people of BA) love to live life. Awesome atmosphere. Be willing to walk and explore to become part of this culture."

There also loads of buses and Linea D on the Subte runs up and down Santa Fe. For all the benefits, it's a bit stodgy. To find the cool, head to Palermo."

Recoleta is well known for being the high society neighbourhood in Buenos Aires and for its vibrant nightlife.But you'll enjoy walking around in daytime too.Apart from the obvious attractions, like the cemetery with a real who's who of Argentina's past and the great museums (don't miss the Fine Arts one, with a small but important collection and always attractive exhibitions), Recoleta shows an array of French-style buildings worth the detour.Start by the French embassy itself, an icon of the city, just around a small beautiful square surrounded by other beautiful buildings like the Brazilian embassy, the Jockey Club (where you can have lunch if you were a tie and jacket) and an array of little Paris houses and buildings.Walk down Arroyo Street, with its S-shaped shadowy look, full of art galleries, every one with a small treasury hidden in a corner. It end towards one of the most beautifull unknown architecture treasuries of Buenos Aires: the Estrugamou Palace, an amazing rental building of the early 20th century. If you're lucky, on of its tenants will invite you to visit inside. Don't miss the chance.To the north you have the quintessentially Parisian avenue: Alvear, showing how the high class of earlier Buenos Aires liked to show tiself and its power: the Vatican embassy, the Building of the Academies, the Culture Ministry were all family owned houses.A special word for the hotels built on old palacettes: the Hyatt at the Duhau's (don't miss the unexepect hilly gardens inside), the Four Seasons at the Alzaga Unzue's and the Sofitel at the Bencich's.You can visit Recoleta or you can live it. Choose the later."

The mall itself offers a nice break from exploring the region.

Although many of the French styled ch\u00e2teaux have been demolished, a walk down Alvear Avenue will take you past the Palacio Duhau (former property of the Duhau family), the Nunciature of the Vatican (the Fern\u00e1ndez Anchorena Palace), the French Embassy (former Ortiz Basualdo Palace), the Brazilian Embassy (former Pereda Palace), the Jockey Club, and the luxurious Alvear Palace Hotel. It is interesting to see how half of the planned Alvear Palace Hotel was not completed and instead transformed into apartments. You can see the difference if you look at the windows. Amazing history is also in the Recoleta cemetery which is the size of a city block filled with leafy avenues and narrow, marble walled streets and alleys. It is filled with the last resting places of the many notable Argentinians such as presidents, Nobel prize winners and a granddaughter of Napoleon. Evan Peron, the First Lady, can be visited at site 88. Ironically she was buried by her sisters in the family tomb with the father who did not play a role in her life after a long journey and controversy on where her final resting place should be. For more information about the area, go on a free two hour walking tour with Buenos Aires Free Tours. Jimena was a great guide. The tour starts at 5 PM from the San Martin Statue and winds from Retiro to Recoleta."

I think that a guided tour is a must so that you can a true feeling of the meaning of this place and the history of the people who are buried here.

There are also shopping centers, restaurants and very nice homes and buildings in the general area, some of the nicest in Buenos Aires. You can spend a complete morning and have lunch or complete afternoon and have dinner. The area is quite, clean and pretty safe, as always in any big city, don't flaunt expensive jewelry, don't take out your wallet or money in public and the bigger your group the better (4 is great) and most of all, just be aware, keep your eyes open and you will be fine."

Also once you are done shopping you can walk that whole strip at night for bars and also people selling on the streets.

Also walking from there is the recolleta park and my kids had fun just running and playing with other people's dogs. And sometimes at the park they have live music right on the lawn.

Walking around with elegant boutiques, hotels like Alvear Palace -the bar is reccomended- as well as de Bougogne restaurant or the traditional Cafe and bar \"La Biela\" just around the block are high in the least of attractions not to be missed.

There are hundreds of artists' booths, but the jugglers, dancers, food vendors and lounging student musicians provided the real entertainment. Nuestra Senora del Pilar Church was small but highly ornate and the small museum there was well worth the visit.

A tour would've been nice, and they have regularly-schedule Spanish ones. If I went again, I'd try to arrange an English one (even if it was a download on my phone or something). However, if you don't have a tour and just want to take it in, that won't be disappointing, it just will mean a shorter trip.Of course, there's the final resting place of Evita Peron (Duarte). While this is interesting both from the historic perspective and the fact that the tomb always has an abundance of fresh flowers and tributes, from a tomb-gazing perspective there are more interesting ones.What's hard to realize, until you're there, is how elaborate and (dare I say it) ostentatious some of these are? Meters-high sculptures. 100% marble. Sitting/genuflection rooms. Elaborate setups, carvings, and tributes. I had been told, but it didn't really register until I was there.You can get disoriented pretty easily while in there, but it's small enough that this wasn't alarming. There are tons of stray cats that seemed friendly-ish, but I avoided because I didn't want to antagonize one and maybe get bit.This was a good way to spend a couple of hours."

Depending on the street you can have simple cafes / bakeries / ice cream stores and small hair salons. Other streets (like Alvear) have higher end shops (towards the Retiro neighbourhood).

Argentina's famous and infamous families buy a plot and build as they wish. Many generations can be buried in one mausoleum. As with real estate everywhere, price depends on location, location, location - the most expensive being the space next to where Eva Per\u00f3n is buried. It recently sold for $250,000. The cheapest locations are $12,000. Then there is the annual tax and fees for upkeep. Quite a few of the structures have fallen into disrepair because either the family has died out, moved away or is no longer able to afford the annual fees. Sooner or later, these areas are cleared out and resold. It is important to go with a guide so hear the amazing tales of some of the 'residents' of Recoleta Cemetery. In at least one case, the family's trusted housekeeper was buried with them - not inside the main building but in a little annex just outside. There is not a blade of grass or a tree or flower. If the weather is hot, be sure to wear a hat and use sun protection - the tour entails lots of walking. A truly surreal experience."

Very different in my eyes that is accustomed to the more Asian texture.It's architecture is old, detailed and amazing. Just like what I hope they would be. As with most cosmopolitan cities all over the world, it has some of the best shops, hotels and restaurants in the city. I come from a mall-popular country in Asia. And while this city has malls, they are not as large and new as what we may have. The fashion is also unique to Argentina except for the international brands. I will have to add that they have some really exceptional clothing stores. The lines may not complete but a shopaholic can still leave the stores with a nice smile.My top of mind favorite shops would be -1) Rossi Carusso for leather jackets, shoes, bags2) Arandu for leather goods 3) La Dolfina for men's clothes & accessories4) La Martina for the same5) Fueguia Perfumeria in Casa Cavia6) Havana for the alfajores I needed to stop and look carefully as some of the details I was not accustomed to. But once I was able to study them, they were just very, very nice.Take BLACK TAXI cabs only, I was forewarned.

Then Recoleta is for you! Take a few more steps and you'll find yourself in the historical Ricoleta cemetery, the final resting place for many Argentinians dating back to 1700s. Did I mention you'll find Evita there?Turn around the corner and you'll see shops, Museums, Parks and numerous Restaurants and bars.

The paving stones are uneven and sometimes loose. Not recommended for walkers or wheelchairs. One grave site in particular was the resting place of a young girl who, it was discovered later on, actually was not dead when placed inside, where she died. She is featured as a figure of a beautiful young girl coming out of the site, and closing the door. We were on a city tour with a guide, and it was so mesmerizing that we returned on our own on another day. Go during the weekend and there is a craft/vendor market just outside the premises. Go during the week, and there are not the hoards of people milling about, making photographing the beautiful artwork a challenge. Evita's grave is a major draw on weekends. One did not need a lot of any particular religion to be buried there, just a lot of money. The heirs could sell the mausoleum, so how could one 'forever rest in peace\"? Nearby is a huge shopping mall, as well as plenty of restaurants."

There is a plethora of steak houses dotted around the area and I went on a steak fest in my time there and never had a bad meal as the restaurants here have a reputation to upkeep. Even though food and a cemetery doesn't sound appetizing you can visit there and also during the day, it's the kind of cemetery that celebrates life not death so it's a different experience. Also it's a great area at night as the Hard Rock Cafe is just around the corner a good Irish bar called St. Patrick if your looking for a more international style night out, but rest assured there is a cold Quilmes available everywhere in Recoleta."

In some masuelums you could see inside and what is inside is amazing ie: stained glass windows, marble altars and statues, paintings, etc. The most moving was a marble statue of a mother reclining with her baby next to her. There were also crypts that are badly neglected and one we actually saw the skeleton of a woman that was exposed."

Clean, calm and beautiful neighborhood, cozy cafes, tango street dancers, many plants (like the famous hakaranda) \u2013 it is the atmosphere of the Buenos-Aieres indeed.

The location could not be better: quietly tucked away, yet only metres from a great mall and all the action and sidewalk caf\u00e9s/restaurants one could wish for. The atmosphere is very buzzy.The area is clean, safe and visitor friendly. Plenty of high end shops and restaurants, but cheaper ones too. Not to mention Starbucks, McCafe, TGIF and MacDonalds (if you want that type of thing) coexisting beside trendy, sophisticated patisseries and restaurants.Oh, and did I mention that there's an interesting cemetery here too..."

I would recommend spending a day visiting both the major tourist sites of Recoleta and Palmero together. To get here you take the metro 'green line' and get off at either the Facultad de medicina or Pueyyredon stop. From there I suggest walking through it's streets visiting it's various sites on the way. Start at Recoleta cementery > Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes AND/OR MALBA > Floralis generalis before tracking home via the closest metro station by walking through one of Palmero's parks."

Maybe I just expected too much (I don't like cemetaries in general, but I was nicely surprised by the old cemetary in Salzburg, and after this I thought I might give this one a chance too, especially considering it's famosity). It has a lot of grandeur, but it's not extraordinary beautiful. The grave of Evita Peron is the most famous one, but certainly not the most beautiful one. Some of the graves could use maintenance. It's difficult to orientate at the cemetary, but free guided tours in English and Spanish are offered, which add more extra values to the place, since the stories and history is more interesting than the view itself."

If you are interested in architecture, art, design, symbology and a unique time in history (1840-1940) that will never be repeated again, set aside more than a half day at Recoleta Cemetary. If you can, arranged for a qualified tour guide because it's too big to do on your own efficiently. The facades, the stone, the statues, the gates, the alters, the mosaics on the insides, the spiral stairs down two levels below grade, .... it is all over the top and give you insights into the wealth and sophistication of the original family, their beliefs at the time, and the abiltiy for them to have an abundance of choices as to how to be remembered. Evita is the least interesting tomb in this cemetary although one of the better stories. So, take an umbrella because there is no shade here and take your time to appreciate how special a place this is."

The Recoleta Cemetario is surrounded on all sides by parks, shops, malls, and restaurants, both inside and on the terraces. The cemetery is completely unexpected: it is grander and more elaborate than you can possibly imagine. There is a donation/fee. Take your time and look closely at the ornate funeral styles.

They stand out because it is those young men and tourists basically at this cemetery, and cats who upon close inspection, look like they have the mange. I saw Evita's tomb. Carlos Gardel is not here, buried somewhere else and those were the two I was mainly interested in. The cemetery is a little spooky and very atmospheric. I thought of that scene in the House of Spirits where they bury the father at the end. I don't know if it was filmed there but it looked very similar. What is really cool is the tree outside the cemetery -- I believe it is over 200 years old and super magnificent. Check my photo, it is very pretty and worth seeing as much as the cemetery."

We had two separate tour guides take us through the Recoleta cemetery, and, other than the Evita Peron tomb, both tour guides had unique and different stories to tell of different tombs. Art and impressiveness aside, I can't imagine having gotten as much out of the Recoleta experience if it had not been for the tour guides and their knowledge of the unique stories of each of the individuals there. It felt like walking through a story book, and I imagine that the individuals buried there must enjoy their people watching of us - possibly maybe even enjoy the visitors. Other than some stairs to enter the cemetery, a stroller was easy to push around (even flooring within the cemetery). There are bathrooms in the cemetery, but they had no toilet paper - so bring your own, just in case. I was fortunate that I had some toilet paper on hand. The restrooms were clean. There is no entrance fee. The Evita Peron tomb is a MUST - not for the impressiveness of the tomb, but for the touristy aspect of it. Read up on her before you go, it will mean more then."

The cemetery filled with mausoleums is well worth a visit and It does have a few historical sights and museums to visit but that's about it. There are a lot of parks but they are very poorly maintained if they are maintained at all and littered with trash. There were numerous groups of men ranging in age from the late teens to upper 20's wandering around everywhere and very little police presence which made my wife and I feel a little unsafe. I hate to bash an entire city but we were not impressed with Buenos Aires including Recoleta. It seems like a city lost souls who are unable to help themselves achieve a decent lifestyle. The long history of corrupt government probably created this situation and it will not change until the people Buenos Aires do something to help themselves and their city."

For Shopping there are some more upscale leather goods stores - I prefer it to the very touristic Calle Florida. That being said, prices will be a bit higher, but worth it.

Then we walked to the national art museum, stopped for ice cream at Persicco, returned to the cemetery, watched the tango dancers on the corner, and the numerous dog walkers in the park, and hailed a cab back to the hotel.

A must see place is Recoleta Cementary. I know, but trust me, you will be amazed.They say people saved their whole life so they could be buried here. The marble statues, stain glass. You can wander around in here for hours. Everyone wants to see Evita's family tomb, but just passing all the others is a shame. This is the who's who of Argentine history. Right across the park is a pedestrian walkway where you can stop for a coffee or tea, or if you are really thirsty, Buller, a brew pub. There is high end shopping at Patio Bullrich. Go to the Hotel Alvear for tea time, or just stroll away and see what restaurant you discover. This area is fill of everything."

It's pretty amazing.If you're looking for Evita's grave, check the map in the lobby when you come in. The grave is modest, and it's difficult to find. Your best bet is to find one of the groundsmen to point you in the right direction. It would have been nice if they had a sign, since while I was searching I found several other people in the same boat I was in.

And don't forget Restaurant Row, which has several restaurants with tables out under the enormous spreading rubber trees, some of the biggest in the world. Cafe Biela is the favorite hangout of many Buenos Aires lovers. Just hope you are lucky and can get a table!! Fervor is another excellent restaurant nearby.

The place can be confusing, but there are signs leading you to the most popular tombs. For Americans who are not used to above ground tombs, this is an interesting place. You can wander around La Recoleta for quite a while. The variety of different designs of the tombs is quite amazing. Some of them are quite beautiful and tastefully done, while others are gaudy and awful. Some are well-maintained while others are quickly crumbling into dust.

The store and shops are more on the high end so not a bargain hunters dream. But some great restaurants with great prices. Don't bother popping into a Burger King or McDonald's for a quick bite, the exchange rate is not kind to them. You will end up spending more on a burger and fries than a nice sit down meal at a great restaurant. i.e. $12 for a hamburger.Recoleta Cemetery is a must stop as is the adjoining church. The mausoleums range from over the top statuary to Egyptian themed. Meticulously maintained, with fresh flowers and scrubbed clean to broken down and falling in. Be prepared to see rotting caskets withing feet of where you are walking but it is an amazing place to really see the history of the city and country. I went with my friend who was born and raised in B.A. so it was nice to hear him talk about certain figures buried there. Lots of nice cafes, with wifi, down the street and an indoor mall if you want to get out of the heat.I stayed in Recoleta for a week and feel like I only scratched the surface."

It\u2019s north of the City Center and shares a border with Almagro, Palermo, and Retiro.Recoleta is known for stately homes and plush hotels and considered by many to be the most affluent neighborhood in Buenos Aires. It is an area of immense historical interest.The barrio became popular in the late 18th century when an outbreak of yellow fever in the southern suburbs forced people to move north. Those who migrated divided large estates into smaller plots in a residential barrio and built stately homes.Ricoleta\u2019s highlight is the Recoleta Cemetery. Covering about 14 acres. The cemetery is a mini-village of tombs. Some are lavish and others crumbling.Some of the museums and cultural attractions in Recoleta include a cultural center with art, concerts, theatrical performances, and festivals. Recoleta is also home to the Museo Nacional de Bellas Ares, displaying work by Goya and Rembrandt - it's a must see!Ricoleta has many plazas and parks. Don't miss Plaza Francia for its weekend artisan market Feria de Artesanos de Plaza Francia, commonly known as the \u2018Hippy Fair\u2019. Parque Thais and Plaza Justo Jose de Urquiza are other popular parks in Recoleta not to be missed."

Lots of restaurants in the area as well, but beware of many tourist traps. Have a coffee at La Biela, where, if you're into that and lucky, you may spot some local politicians or even Hollywood actors (Robert Duvall is a fan, so I've heard).

Great market on the green on Sunday's and if weather is good often some free live entertainment. There is also a design shopping centre and Hard Rock Cafe , if that is you thing."

The are of Recoleta is the equivilent in London of Knightsbridge - fancy very traditional mansion appartments, coffee shops, jewellers and discrete luxury hotels. It is interesting to walk through to get to the Cemetary. If looking for Eva Peron's tomb, look for her family name Duarte. There is a list on a board as you enter the cemetary on the left. She only has a brass plaque on the outside of a very modest black marble tomb in a narrow alley, to the far left as you go in. Looking in the thousands of crumbling tombs is a pleasant way the spend the afternoon. If you leave the cemetary, tund left down the slope the free, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes is only a few minutes walk."

A lady is hawking self-guided tour maps in either a green kiosk outside the cemetery, or in the marble gated entrance. recommended amount is P0 to get the map which highlights some main tombs. BE CAREFUL !! She seemed to spend an unusually long time talking to me, ad touching my arms, before she would let me go. Which seemed a bit odd. Then after i was walking for a few minutes, some items fell out my backpack. The zips were wide open, impossible they would open like that. There were few people where i was walking inside, so i am 99% sure the map lady was in cahoots with an accomplice in the gate area. I might be wrong, but anyway, keep your wits about you. Inside many interesting tombs, Eva Perons is under the family name DURANTE, to the nine o'clock position from entrance, just set back off the the left alley. Its a simple tomb with a plain marble face. Not many taxis in the vicinity, some are loitering for longer cab fares at the taxi stand. so i walked 2 blocks away before getting a taxi"

Me, I passed on the chinchilla throw but went for the great leather carry all. L Vuitton may be a more recognizable logo but we're talking marginal benefit to marginal cost. Great leather store.Lopez Taibo: wonderful leather shoes. Fell in love with a leather jacket there but didn't have my size. Kitty corner across from APH.Cravall: just up the street from L Taibo. Well dressed older gentleman letting you in (should you pass the screening...) is founder. His son, Frederico, is spot on. Knows his stuff. Engaging fellow. You will not be disappointed by selection or prices.Arandu: another leather place. Serious polo store too. Check out the belt selections.

There are plenty of good restaurants , shopping stores and historical landmarks to choose from and the area is safe !

I am staying in an apartment in the Recoleta neighbourhood and although it is a little far from the tango scene, it is fairly clean and safe ( in BA standards as this city is VERY dirty and in my mind somewhat dangerous). My apartment is on a busy street however and quite noisy so I have to sleep with ear plugs. The main street (General Las Heras) is wide and noisy but the side streets are quieter and nice to walk along. I have found most everything I need here from key cutting to butcher shops and the buses go most everywhere I need to go. The Recoleta Cemetery is close and if you are a good \"walker\", this neighbourhood is a great starting point in any direction. I walk here often alone at night on my way home from a milonga, and have never felt threatened. Dodging cars crossing the street is another thing and I have experienced people almost getting hit (including me) on at least three occasions. It would be terrifying to bring small children to BA, but if you had to choose a neighbourhood, this might be one of the better ones, especially as there are a few parks in the area."

A humbling experience for someone who enjoys history and calming strolls. Whether you just visit to get away from the busy city, or to view the tombstones, you wont be dissapointed. Its somewhat of a maze so try to carry a map as to not get overwhelmed. I would recommend getting a guide so you can read up about each tomb that interest you.

A lot more to it than the famous cemetery, good as it is, together with the Cultural Center and the beautiful white-washed Basilica of Nostra Senora del Pilar in the same strip. There are excellent accommodations, a few good places to eat, lots of green space, and two of the major museums of the city (Bellas Artes and Decorative Arts). It hosts several faculties of the University of Buenos Aires (Law, Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy), as well as the remarkable National Library that resembles a huge rectangular sculpture standing on a pedestal that is much too small for it. Shopping opportunities abound: the lower-end Recoleta Mall is the place to go indoors for the bargains, while the open-air market on the edge of the park facing the Museo de Bellas Artes offers a colorful array of what most open-air markets offer. But there is no lack of expensive high-end shopping at internationally renowned outlets as well. Several of the hotels and apartment blocks are truly up-market, and I advise you to step into the foyer of the Alvear Palace Hotel to see one of the most gorgeously decorated interiors of the city. As in most S. American cities, handsome statues of dubious heroes abound ( Mitre Bartolome, Guillermo Rawson, Carlos Alvear), as well as several that can be considered works of pure art ( The Archer, The Last Centaur, a dramatic Nude Male Torso by Fernando Botero, and the celebrated but now half-deceased metal sculpture Floralis Generica by Edward Catalino that was designed to open at dawn and close at dusk, but whose mechanism has been \u201ckaput\u201d for several years). There is so much grass and parkland upon which you can stroll, in contrast to the dangerously crumbling sidewalks facing pedestrians in most other parts of the city."

Lots of very nice apartment buildings, five star hotels, intermixed with old mansions now occupied by embassies. There are numerous good restaurants and opportunities for window shopping. However, as is the case with most of Buenos Aires, this is a residential neighborhood and not a tourist destination. The residents of Buenos Aires justifiably compare their city's architecture to Paris, and the street vibe does match that city, as well. However, the absence of world-class museums, historical buildings, and general cultural excitement would justify only a brief visit here. In contrast, one could spend a month in Paris or New York and still not have time to visit all that is available. Furthermore, it was most disturbing to be warned by everyone, guides, hotel employees, etc, to be very wary of pickpockets and avoid carrying passports, money even in the busy commercial streets of downtown or the elegant residential areas.A final word to the wise. Bring US dollars to use for any purchases because the Argentinian peso has no value either in or out of the country. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, will eagerly accept dollars and give you an exchange rate far better than the official 8.5 pesos to the dollar. On average, we got 12 to the dollar in restaurants, stores and taxis and might have gotten even more with a bit more aggressive bargaining. That just seemed too crass for us with the locals already under so much financial strain from their own government. (DO NOT USE THE STREET MONEY CHANGERS! You will encounter them everywhere, even waling around the shopping district shouting \"cambio.\" The rate might be better but the risk of crime would be worse. It would also be illegal.)"

Yes the sculptures in the various (above ground) tombs are often magnificent, and seeing the tributes left to Evita are moving. But more than that, there is something very evocative about the whole experience, which captures part of the BA experience of passion, refinement, art, sorrow and also joy in life. this is one place you must visit if you go to BA"

The blue market is located just behind one of the deluxe hotels. A long line forms after 4pm and everyone is there to either buy pesos with $US or to buy $US with pesos. This is quite the experience to know that one can gain at least 5% more than the bank rate. Recoleta is a quiet retreat but It is more fun staying in other areas of BA."

We were never able to get a straight answer about the cemetery; one security guard said it was closed for renovation, one said it was only open early Saturday, alas we were not able to visit. In front of the cemetery is an enormous Rubber Tree known as \"the Gran Gomero\" it was planted in 1791 and it is well worth going to see and maybe taking your picture next to it!

A nice part of the city that has almost no crime, plenty of restaurants, confiterias(bakeries), clothing stores and many small family run businesses. Walking is the best method of transportation, but taxi's almost outnumber personal cars. So, if traveling to other parts of the city, then a taxi is a safe/reliable/modestly priced option. There are buses & the subway, which can be crowded. We've exchanged our dollars at the blue rate, which makes Argentina very reasonable for us. Recently, we went to a travel agency to get a quote in pesos on a flight. We asked and was told of a place that would exchange dollars at the blue rate. Even though we rent an apartment with a kitchen, our favorite activity is eating at the area establishments. There are many, small & large. We haven't found one we didn't like.

I had originally planned on visiting Recoleta not really expecting to see much other than the Recoleta Cemetery. However, once I started walking there from blocks away I was impressed by the unique & extravagant architecture that every building had. It ranged from the older stone buildings to the more modern steel and glass skyscrapers.Walking around I found myself in a boutique bread shop which was a pleasant and unexpected treat. Then walked over to the Cemetery and found myself exploring it for over an hour and a half even though I went in thinking I would only see Evita's grave. I could have easily spent more time, but being a tourist with a long list of places to visit I thought I should continue to my next destination.The church next to the Cemetery is beautiful. The park, the trees, the museum and other attractions in Recoleta are really just perfect to spend a whole day just walking around and taking your time."

It's more upscale, so you see the European elegance to the buildings. The park in Recoleta is nice and there are artisans selling their goods, which was cool to see. The famous cemetery is in this neighborhood. It's a bit odd for a cemetery to be an attraction, but honestly, it was eerily beautiful."

There are a couple of little cats that great you as you walk in, along with potential walking tour guides that will politely either offer a tour or point out some must-sees on a map and let you wander on your own. If they determine you are from the US or most non-European, non-South American countries, they'll mostly aim you to Evita Peron's crypt, but it's nothing to take personal, it's probably who you wanted to see, anyway.We visited in the afternoon and the waning light over the mausoleums made for great photographs, and it was great atmosphere to alternately ponder the beautiful memorials of beloved family and gasp in recognition at great names from Latin American history.Make a mental note of some unique landmarks as you enter, every white marble angel looks the same after a few hours and it can take a minute to find your way back if you're not in an area with a famous person featured on the map.Unlike history-laden cemeteries in the US, there will not be paper and utensils to take a rubbing of a meaningful epitaph, and folks will give odd looks if you ask for it.

And most importantly it's safer than much of the rest of the city.I'd suggest Palermo for the younger party crowd but in reality cabs are SO ridiculously inexpensive here (traveled all around the city and never spent more than $6 US) Recoleta is a good alternative if you want some quiet time."

The interesting aspect of Recoleta is the statuary throughout. Some of the most beautiful sculptures in Buenos Aires can be found here. Make sure that you purchase a map at the entrance for 15 pesos ($2.00 US) since the cemetery is quite large and can be confusing without some plan. For fans of Evita Peron, her tomb is located here and is one of the major stops on the walk through the cemetery. Plan two to three hours to explore Recoleta at a leisurely pace. There are mosquitos galore here--bring some bug repellent if this can be a problem. There is a caf\u00e9 located nearby for lunch (La Biela--see separate review) that is perfect.

An afternoon tea at the Alvear Palace hotel is expensive but unforgettable! The Recoleta Mall and Patio Bullrich are sufficiently sophisticated for the serious shopper but are of course expensive. You may want to try Avenida Santa Fe where the prices are not as expensive. There are Many excellent book stores including El Ateneo and Cuspide and many, many more.The Recoleta design centre is a very interesting place. The Saturday and Sunday market in the park in front of the Recoleta art centre is something to be seen.

The easiest way to know what you are seeing is to join a guided party at hte front gate. English guides are available at certain times of the day ... we wondered around by ourselves though.The cemetry is like a large village, with a large number of streets filled with a bizarre range of what can only be called houses for tombs. Some really ornate and temple-like; many with Victorian pathos and angels guarding the dead. One has two like-size sculptures of soldiers on either side of the door. The most touching is the bronze statue of a daughter who did not return from a skiing trip .. she is joined in bronze by her faithful dog at her feet; with his shiny nose that visitors stroke for luck, keeping it brightly burnished. The place is huge and not easy to find one's way around - but if one follows the crowd, then the destination will be Eva Peron. The site is really interesting, yet vaguely disturbing. Some of the \"houses\" have the doors hanging off the hinges, due to the fact that there is nobody left in that family to maintain the family crypt. Others are immaculate. In between two of the tombs there is what looks like a really poor offering .... what a shock, then, to hear voices coming from it! With relief, but an enhanced feeling of bizzarenes, we realised that it was just a maintenance hut with a group of workmen inside, taking a break and a snack ... but why did they eat in the dark?The happiest creatures in the ground appeared to be the several cats, rolling or sleeping in the sun.This is a must-visit, but after a while it does start to press on one's very being and that is the time to leave to join the excellent crafts market on the parkland just outside the gates.BUT ... if you want a really strange end to the day; turn right out of the cemetry gates and go into the mall about 100m away. Ascend the escalator and head for McDonalds and there you will see that the best overhead view of the cemetry (which is right below the window) can be had whilst eating a big Mac .... and if you eat too many of those, you too could be joining the residents, but probably not in quite such splendour!"

There are hundreds of excellent vendors selling everything from clothing, jewelry, accessories, artwork, to mate gourds and food. I bought many souvenirs there. There are people playing live music, sitting/laying in the park, and entertainment (tango dancers, clowns, music etc.) The Recoleta Cemetery is right there and it is a very interesting/historical place to check out. Buller's Brew Pub is near and they have VERY good IPA (hard to find in BA). The parks are beautiful and the vibe is good"

This almost ostentatious design of the mausoleums is typical of many Spanish cemeteries. I'm not sure what the deceased did in life to warrant these, but I thoroughly enjoy the sculptures and other adornments found here.

There are a number of nice green parks, the most interesting is Plaza Francia just outside of the Cemetery. Plaza Francia is also the home to a couple of extremely large and old trees that need to be seen.

Go early in the summer because a lot of heat radiates off of all the cement."

Took about 1 1/2 hours and then we wandered a little longer on our own. Cemetery is also close to the Hard Rock if you have to buy a collector t-shirt like we did."

We went around the market, which was pretty much like all the markets you have ever been to, with one or two stalls with slightly different products.So not great, the Sunday market on Defensa is probably better...What Recoleta has in slightly greater abundance (although it is a problem throughout Buenos Aires to a greater or lesser degree) is dog pooh. Locals say that it is because the dogs in the slightly posher area of Recoleta are walked 10 or 15 at a time by professional dog walkers - and they don't 'pick up' the poohs. OK, it must be quite difficult if you have a large number of dogs, but even so.........."

Because to the heat wave, the electricity went out a couple of times during the night & it was sweltering. We didn't want to risk it happening during the next 10 days of our stay so our host lowed us to cancel. We then decided to try Recoleta and went to air bnb again. We've been at a wonderful apartment in a classic building & highly recommend air bnb for a local experience. It's also very reasonable, $100/night. Our host has recommended the best value wines and where to find them, Frappe on Av Callao. We chose a Cab-Malbec blend. 10% discount on 6 bottles. He also arranged currency exchange for us this morning at a source he knows. We netted $9.4 ARS per US dollar."

We were warned about not wearing upscale watches in the Florida Avenue pedestrian mall and we were careful the entire time about this (so we thought). At the Recoleta market on a Saturday morning, a young man ran and almost fell upon my husband. He pushed against my husband and grasped his watch. The band snapped and my husband grabbed the man who ran across the street. The man had a buddy waiting with a motorcycle and they sped off. No one at the market was able to help. We wonder if someone tipped the man off from the market. The policeman that we located on a nearby corner did not speak any English. We received conflicting information about how/where to report the incident. It turns out there are numerous districts of police within the city and each is responsible only for their area. The tourist police is not open on weekends. The appropriate district for the area (District 17) was backed up for hours, we were told there were 4 reports at least in front of us. It was our departure day and we didn't have the time to even go. We were also told that the police are pretty useless anyway."

There are a lot of intellectual people, industrialists, diplomats, and great people buried in there. let's not forget the architectural masterpieces that are the graveyards themselves.However, More care and attention should be given this place. For example, there is graveyard with a small broken glass in the ceiling. It costs nothing to replace, but all the rain leaking into the structure is seriously damaging the wonderful coffins in there. I really felt sad and sorry for those resting in there.

One can visit the cemetery, shop at small boutique shops or at the Mall at PatioBullrich or weekend market on Sat & Sunday, sample ice-cream, or dine atsome of the best Italian restaurants in BA. Piegari is located across from the Four Seasons inthe Recova Area & our favorite, La Pecora Nera is on Ayacuyo.Best time to visit is in spring, the month of November if you love flowers. The jacaranda trees arein full bloom and the city looks like one giant flower arrangement. It takes 20 min. to walk from theCemetery to the Palermo Parks if you are a runner or walker."

A must see if you are interested in mausoleum architecture and you want to see where Evita is buried ..The Evita mausoleum is hard to find as she is buried with her father's family ..after being moved around several times this is her final resting place and is a real disappointment. Follow a line of people going through the cemetery and they are usually heading that way or just say \"Evita?\" to one of the workers and they will walk you there (show them a tip for service) . The rich and famous of Argentina are buried here in massive edifices that resemble small houses in size . Who says that you cannot take it with you ??"

The Center is active year-round and a great place to enjoy and find out more about the local music and arts scene."

It was a wonderful way to wander around in peace and quiet in the middle of the bustling city and see a lot of interesting things. It's very close to one of the hop-on, hop-off bus stops and a tourist office.There is no admission fee and a very good map is available at the gate for a very small price.

Those priests founded a monastery, a church dedicated to Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar and a cemetery attached to the complex, still proudly standing defying the passing of time. La Recoleta boasts of many \u201cmosts\u201d: the Alvear Palace Hotel, the most sumptuous in all of Latin America, the Cemetery, comparable to the one in Paris, and among the most sumptuous in the world, huge and luxurious private family mansions, foreign embassies, elegant modern constructions, etc.  What you can visit: the National Fine Arts Museum, the National Library , the Recoleta Cultural Center, the Recoleta Cemetery (where Eva per\u00f3n\u2019s tomb is located), the Palais de Glace, Libertador Avenue, Carlos Thays Park, many University Colleges : of Law, of Medicine, of Dentistry, of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, the newly opened Recoleta Mall, La Biela Bar (one of the most traditional in Bs As), great sculptures, the Floralis Gen\u00e9rica, Alvear Avenue (with great examples of \u201cchateaux\u201d, Parisian style petit hotels, the Palacio Duhau, the Nunciature of the Vatican, the French Embassy, the Brazilian Embassy, the Jockey Club, the Buenos Aires Design Shopping Center, Francia Square (with an amazing monument given by the French people to Argentina on the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence).

I personally find cemeteries fascinating because having a place to \u2018rest\u2019 is a natural progression for everyone in life\u2019s journey. How people remember loved ones of both genders, past Presidents, the rich, the famous, scholars, national heroes etc are exemplified in La Recoleta Cemetery.If you can call a burial ground atmospherically beautiful then we found it here in the hundreds upon hundreds of elaborately vaulted above ground tombs \u2013 a huge number decorated with statues. Built initially around a convent and church in 1732 (Our Lady of Pilar), it gave way eventually to this enormous public cemetery. Nearly a hundred of these tombs are deemed National Historical Monuments but many others have fallen into disrepair - families run out of money, dynasties disappear and in places coffins are exposed.The ominous entry fa\u00e7ade has Doric columns, Neo \u2013 Classical style architecture and as you look up before entering a Latin inscription Expectamus Dominum (Waiting For Our Saviour?) gives you an idea of what lies ahead.The main tree lined walkways has a perplexing number of labyrinthine sidewalks on the left and right.These are filled with mausoleums & tombs interred with the wealthy or adored which is why most visitors come to see Eva Per\u00f3n's resting place in the Duarte family vault \u2013 just follow the groups. Unless you have a map of the cemetery, then it becomes overwhelmingly confusing - you can get lost.The entry office has a free photocopied map to locate some of the most \u2018famous\u2019 tombs or if you have a photographic memory, a wall map is also near the entry - take a snap on your phone.We were in awe of these sculptured masterpieces located around every corner or sidewalk but take some water, as it gets hot in here. However, like any famous \u2018attraction\u2019, a couple of good cafes and souvenir kiosks are outside near a lovely open space. Entrance is free, open daily 7am \u2013 6pm \u2013 not a place for after dark as with most cemeteries they have some 'ghost' stories!We loved it!Enjoy your experience!"

Markets everywhere in the world tend to be same same (but same). This was an amazing artisans market - the jewelly was different, the crafts were different, the bags were different stunning leather, different designs, rustic through to high quality through to cute coin purses for US$3. AND look out for nifty coin based jewelley for very little dosh - great rings and pendants for US$5-6each - at almost every stall we were delighted. Look out for very inexpensive jewellery in \"Alpaca\" - no - not the woolly cutie pies from Peru - it is basically a base metal/stainless steel or like the old EPNS cuttlery you might have from your granny.... you might pay US$1-2 for a ring. Lots of silver - \"Plata\" 925/950/1000 (the good stuff). It's been a long time since we enjoyed a market so much. And a great many countries. Look out for fine jewellery also... handmade, highly polished silver rings set with precious stones from garnets through to emeralds.... US$60-200. Cemetery was also great. The rock concert next door certainly can't disturb the neighbours...Ignore the opportunistic gits at the gate who tell you entry is free then give you handwritten directions to Mme Peron's tomb. Then ask for money. Jeez... follow your nose (and the thousands of tourists) and if you like kitty cats, get the camera onto black & white and prepare for some classic shots."

It was really an interesting place so we ended up walking around for a couple hours. Coming in the entrance we were approached by multiple people wanting a donation for their cause. One volunteered wanted me to buy a map for $2 USD. I didn't really see any need since I didn't know anyone other than Evita. The volunteer was very mad at me and made me feel bad for a moment. I think if I went again, I would just push past all the people wanting donations. To find Evita's crypt you should remember she was Eva Duarte and she is in the Duarte family crypt. It is rather inconspicuous. It is worth the walk and the more time you spend there the less creepy it will feel."

When you're done, head to one of the main streets and hail a cab for a ride back to the city where the more affordable hotels are."

We spent our first hour here looking at the fascinating tombs of prominent Buenos Aires citizens. Don't fall for the scam artists outside the entrance, even if they show you a badge. Wait till you get inside and then buy the map from the official volunteers - you will need it! Then go and have a drink at one of the cafes across the park, as they are really good, and not that much overpriced considering the location. Take bug spray, as there are mosquitos in the water used for the flowers placed on the graves."

It was clean, with wide sidewalks for strolling, upmarket and gracious. It's very close to the centre of the city and you can even walk there if you cared to. There are plenty of small shops, boutiques, eateries and supermarkets around. Plus, there are many attractions nearby, such as Recoleta Cemetary, where Eva Peron is buried, the local weekend artisan's market, with interesting innovative wares, pretty parklands with lots of statuary and public art, galleries and the famous giant Floralis Generica, the huge stainless steel flower, which opens and closes like a daisy, according to the sun patterns. It may be a bit more costly than other parts of BsAs, but not outrageously so. The exception is Recoleta Mall and particularly Patio Bullrich for outrageously expensive shopping and gawping at wealthy women, wearing lots of peroxide hair and fake leopard skin. I could only afford an expensive coffee at Patio Bullrich, priced at three times the going rate outside, for the same standard.The area is well maintained and safe to stroll in at night. People often say that San Telmo is the \"real Buenos Aires\", but, as I have commented elsewhere, i don't know why some people think that you need dirt, grime, decay and menace to have a real experience. I'm sure that Recoleta residents think their lives are just as real. The famous La Biela cafe is there and is open till about 2am. I went there on foot several times late at night quite happily.If I went back to BsAs, i would choose Recoleta again."

Rows of wonderfully designed mini-buildings that contain family crypts separated by small streets make it into a literal city of the dead. Very surreal but we spent hours wandering through and could have spent more if we had the time. A must-see if you're in Recoleta."

On our 7 hour walking tour, Marcelo shared with us his love of Bs As as well as his knowledge. It was not a memorized-blurb-at-each-attraction tour; Marcelo taught us about the city, it's history, politics, economics and social life in pleasant conversation, welcoming our questions and our opinions.

One item that most visitors never hear about is the Chacarita Cemetery. It is world class and may even best Recoleta. Among it's inhabitants are Juan Peron and the Argentine Tango Singer Carlos Gardella (sorry if I spelled his name incorrectly). It has a statue of him and locals and visitors place a lit cigarette in the hands of the statue. I also have a friend buried there with the surname Gastelu.

No sure who is paying for the existing ones if that is the case as many are in a state of disrepair to the point that they are open and have weeds growing inside there broken glass encasements.

Returning this Sept. 2012 was a treat, albeit the vibe overall in BA feels different. Perhaps it's the impact of inflation, government corruption, and the increase in crime. Nevertheless weI felt relatively safe walking around at night, and the elegant Recoleta area felt particularly secure. We stayed at the boutique hotel Mio Buenos Aires and had a great experience there. It's literally a two minute walk from Recoleta cemetery and the Basilica Nuestra Senora del Pilar, and Plaza Francia where all the cafes are situated. In the Plaza there's a lovely fair on the weekend with live music and art vendors selling their goods. There are great restaurants to consider; Fervor on Posadas and their sister restaurant for Spanish food, El Burladero on Pte. J.E. Uriburu. Try El SanJuanino for authentic locra...also on Posadas, right next to Fervor. For amazing, but expensive Italian food we dined at Piegari, near the Four Seasons hotel. Walk down Callao to visit the famous jazz club Notorious We had a fun evening there.....not spectacular (my novio is a jazz musician and coming from NYC the standard is hard to beat) but it's a good time out taking in good music. Nearby is the famed El Cuartito for amazing pizza. It's a 5 minute walk from Teatro Colon which is a must see! Overall a wonderful stay and Recoleta was a terrific home base."

Have been twice. Once on a Tuesday at 11am to hook up with the free tour in English (Also available on Thursday at the same time). The volunteer guide was excellent and passionate about her subject and gave us a fantastic overview of the diversity of the cemetery. Also a great insight into the practical day to day running of the place - including how to buy a plot for our mausoleum! Second time went on a Sunday when there are a lot of stalls on the paths in front of the cemetery selling the whole range of rubbish through to some very nice local arts and crafts. Whilst entrance to the cemetery is free, for 10 ARG pesos you can buy a map which includes a suggested walk through. This money goes to the friends of Recoleta and helps maintain the site. Exhausted by all of that we had a nice Sunday lunch in the cafe across the park. Lovely day out. Surprised at how small it is - tiny compared to other cemetery's. Surprised at how small the Eva Peron tomb is - expected more splendor. Surprised at how they ever get a coffin down into the underground chambers - a very tight squeeze. Look out for the cats who've made themselves at home"

And even though the reputations is well deserved there also is a very relaxed and quiet elegance to the neighborhood. It is also one of the more cleaner neighborhoods in BA.Recoleta also borders several large parks which include the museo de bellas artes and museo de artes decorativos. It also is home to the famous cemetary which is not just a must see in Buenos Aires, but all of Argentina!If you have time to kill, Recoleta is a great place just to take it easy and enjoy the best (and expensive) of Buenos Aires."

It is highly recommended to visit the McDonalds restaurant in the Recoleta Mall at Vicente Lopez.

In fact we had a view of the famous Recoleta Cemetery from our balcony.This is a lively part of town. Aside from the usual attractions that any guide book can tell you about ... we were entertained by a market and fair on the weekends, musical concerts during the week. And Portenios (BA residents) are not half hearted about participating ... they turn out in droves. They are fun loving people.While other parts of BA can feel a bit sketchy at night (I don't know that they are but they feel that way) Recoleta does not. BA is recovering from it's financial crisis of a decade ago; in Recoleta the evidence is that the recovery is well under way. New hotels and apartments plus the new Recoleta mall (BA doesn't do Walmart type malls ... they are all high end places).Recoleta is also well placed for getting around the rest of BA too. $10 or so will get you to San Telmo, or the weekend Gaucho Festival in Mataderos (well worth a visit ... it is really for locals ... doesn't run in the summer months ... its huge), La Boca, el centro etc.There are lots of nice places to eat from corner kiosks, family style carnavore's dreams, to finer dining. Recoleta is an upper middle class neighborhood and has all the niceties. My wife tells me the shopping is also very good (something I don't have the right chromosomes to understand).All in all one can not go far wrong basing their stay in BA from Recoleta. It is a very nice area, the prices are very good (but not bargain basement). We stayed 2 weeks the apartment was about $50 a night (by the week). There were many modern grocery stores (Carrafour sp?).Enjoy B"

If you time it right, you can hear Mass with beautiful Gregorian chants (just please remember to be respectful of those attending if you are not staying for the whole service).On the left, about half way down the church, there is a small entrance to the Cloister Museum (Claustros Historicos del Pillar). Admission is well worth the 5 pesos. The building is the original cloister of the monks and today holds various objects from the history of the church. If you're lucky, one of the attendants may be kind enough to give you an impromptu tour. You can overlook the cemetery.I never thought a cemetery would be a must see attraction, and this is one you have to see for yourself. Just to put it in perspective, we spent 2 hours and maybe covered 1/3 of it. Bring your camera!Lastly, if you visit on a Sunday or holiday, the fair has some interesting items for sale - from photographs and hand-painted shoes to pottery and other crafts."

Stake my friends! the best and also the cheapest, can you believe that!So Recoleta has it all, Museums, Mall, art fairs and the beautiful cemetery. Finally I want to say that of all the places I have visited this is what I liked most. Honestly I'm thinking about quitting my job and move to Recoleta Argentina"

You can pick up a bus to anywhere you want and the taxi is expensive but Recoleta is not too far from some attractions. You can go walking to some of them."

Free to the public (but watch out for people who will stop you at the bottom of the entrance step, giving you a map, telling you about the cemetary and then asking for money in exchange for thier information) this very old cemetary holds the mausoleums of many notible Argentinians such as Eva Peron and The Duarte family. The beautiful stone sculptures that adorn the crypts are very impressive, some are perfectly maintained, others are in various states of demise. The crypts line each side of the many streets that make up the cemetary, giving it a city within a city feel."

There are a lot of bars, coffee shops, restaurants, fancy shops and so on. It is a nice place to walk and see the architecture of new buildings. There is too the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes, which is very good, with a big and good collection of art. Tip: be aware of opening times of museum, on week days it only opens after noon (we were there in the morning and could not go in...)"

We tried the Rodi Bar and indulged in the lunchtime specials, before sampling all the beers at Bullers. Yes, San Telmo and Palermo may be slightly better. But don't overlook Recoleta."

I thought San Telmo and Palermo were much better as neighborhoods to walk through. Recoleta was overpriced and very touristy. They cemetary is unique, though, with huge ornate houses as tombs of what I assume to be rich dead people. So for that it's fine. But for strolling, finding great cafes, and people watching, stick to Palermo and San Telmo."

Also good is a heavenly cappucuino shake at Freddo Ice Cream, it has coffee, dulce de leche ice cream and milk in it and is divine, worth the 18 pesos! If you do the cemetery, get a tour, it's worth it to learn about the symbolism/history, and they will show you the best sculptures/graves. Love cats? Bring some cat food for the kitties there. If you go in just to see Evita, then leave you are missing out big time. Fredwww.silverstarcar.com"

In the three months spent in Argentina, other than at Llau Llau, it was the most comfortable area of our trip. I would recommend a Cafe and Resto called Syrop or something to that effect. There is the cafe and the full restaurant and both are charming and of very high quality. They both offer a nice break from parrilla. As for shopping in Recoleta, I would stay away from the tourist-driven places around the cemetery although there are some nice outdoor cafes for checking out the locals. Guido is a shoe store in the area that offers very high quality traditional shoes for men and women that are worth checking out. BA is not Paris. It is BA. Be careful of the criminals. I had my watch ripped off of my hand in broad daylight from a cafe in Palermo. However, it is an amazingly diverse country offering the traveler everything."

Recoleta is one of the safest zones in Buenos Aires. You can see policemen guarding all around this neighborhood, so you can feel safe walking around the area. It is filled with clothing stores, shoes stores, restaurants, cafes, pubs, and some clubs. The architectures is very colonial and antique, which makes it a beautiful zone. Everything is quite close within minutes of walking. The Recoleta cemmetery is located here, which makes it one of the best attractions of the zone. There is always something great to do in Recoleta! I definitely recommend visiting this neighborhood of Buenos Aires!"

Recoleta is a pretty and safe area of BA, with European-style architecture. The district has lots of parkside restaurants and cafes (even a McDonalds in the shopping mall) and many serve international cuisine if your digestion needs a break from beef, beef, and more beef! English was commonly spoken, so ordering was a breeze for those of us without Spanish. The Recoleta weekend markets were great fun, lots of talented street artists, buskers and mimes who really engaged the children and the adults. The markets are adjacent to the famous Recoleta cemetery, where Evita and many notable Argentinians are interred. We bought sme local handcrafts, ponchos, musical instruments and there were also t-shirts and the usual tourist items.The kids had a couple of sessions playing online computer games at an internet cafe, but mainly enjoyed the freedom to let off some steam playing football in the parks near the hotel, away from the bustling city centre, which is about a 20 minute stroll away. Taxis are cheap and plentiful, but beware the counterfeit currency scamsters and note the drivers' ID (hanging over the back of his seat, or be extra vigilant if it is not present.A few days in BA with children can be enjoyed with a trip to the opera house, a visit to the famous Teatro Colon, but we were glad to break our stay with travel outside the city.We loved our three days in Colonia del Sacramento - a 40 minute ferry ride to Uruguay across the River Plata. The highlight, though, was a toss up between a couple of days at aworking gaucho ranch, Estancia El Ombu an hour or two north of BA and the fabulous Iguazu Falls. If you're lucky, they'll be running the full moon tour of the falls, but dress warmly!A boat ride up the River Tigre delta was an OK diversion, but I wish we'd known about the huge amusement park nearby, as we would have interrupted the tour there for some theme-park exploration.We also visited the home of tango, La Bocca, whcih can apparently be a bit dangerous at night. Unfortunately, we found it pretty bland on a midweek daytime visit, though.There is very upmarket shopping in the Recoleta district, with a reasonable sizes shopping mall for essentials. Try the Palermo for more variety, including a shopping mall mini amusement area with video games and mini bumper cars for kids.All in all, a bustling city to visit with children for a few days, but definitely improved by the more tranquil surroundings of the Recoleta district."
