The Forum is a delightful stroll through several hundred years of Roman architecture, structures from every period in the empire stacked, sometimes haphazardly, atop each other. Ever angle grants a fresh view on fountains, collonades, columns and other such structures of ancient stone. Well worth a visit, and coupled with the Colosseum at least a few hours of sightseeing."

Perplexed at the apparent late hour we started to ask questions as to what was going on and were informed that there was a 'night tour' until the end of October. We didn't have anything better to do at that hour and were already tired from long walks all day and decided to pay what I thought was a rather exorbitant 20E each to join the next tour in 15 minutes time. WOW - I cannot express how utterly astonishing and absolutely fantastic this was. The organisers have installed state of the art lasers, cameras and computer graphics and you literally live right through the forum in the time of Julius Cesear. The tour lasted about 50 minutes and when it was over I was happy to pay again to go again. It is totally worth every Euro that they charge and I would advise that nobody even contemplate going anywhere near Rome without booking this tour. The latest tech is used to engross and totally immerse the viewer into ancient Roman daily life and every little aspect of that life is brought to life with the use of stunning animations, lasers and ground breaking tech which is available in just about every major language. The research and the work and the preparation that has gone into making these tours is fabulous and you walk away feeling not only like you visited Rome but that you also grasped a teeny weeny sense of Julius and the glory of the Empire when it was at its peak. The tour brings together all of the nitty gritty detail that you just do not get walking around the Forum with a guide book"

We could have purchased tickets online and gotten into the shorter line marked \"reservations\". While my husband waited in the line to purchase tickets I stood under the shade near the reservations line. I noticed that many people seemed to have problems with their reservations. Some were coming on the wrong day while others had problems showing they purchased tickets when showing their phones to the workers. This line moved very slowly. I would advise that if you purchase tickets online that you print out a hard copy of your tickets. As for the Forum, it was so interesting, beautiful and historic. It wasn't too crowded and we toured at our leisure. I highly recommend visiting the Forum when in Rome."

It did not deter from the beauty, history and splendor of the site, however. While heavy rains poured and a fog set in, the origins of Rome told the story of the ancients who lived here. The force of History was very powerful as you gaze upon the ruins.It is wonderfully lit at night and was empty due to the weather but this only added to the mystique. Wear good walking shoes and bring an umbrella if there is even only a slight chance of rain as it gets very slippery."

Wow what a truly amazing place, you take a photo you turn round and then you take another, it's hard to know where to look. In our tour we probably spent 60-90 minutes walking round and it flew by.Does get busy but not to the levels of the Colosseum mainly due to it being a large area and much more spread out. Be warned though many areas not suitable for wheelchairs/buggys due to the 'pavement'.Highly Recommended"

We walked up from the streets, wading through night crawlers who were simply out to have fun, and hustlers who were eager to sell anything from a scarf to shoes and toys for a few bucks. It was a windy night, so the scarf sellers enjoyed some patronage. To think that the first of the three arches of the Roman Forum was built in 29 BC is mind-bogling. The other two arches were added in 81 AD and 203 AD. That is a feat of which the Romans are justifiably proud. The Forum houses the temples of the gods in addition to temporal powers such as the senate and the rostra, the platform from which political leaders like Julius Caesar addressed the people. No single building on Planet Earth today compares to the Roman Forum in sheer multi-disciplinary relevance and aesthetic awe."

You will not escape the queues completely but it will help. A ticket covers the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the Palatine. At the moment it will cost you about 16 Euro. We had a voucher by e-mail that could be exchanged on the day of our visit (any time) by going to the reserved ticket desk at the forum. There was still a queue to get into the forum entrance as you went through security. It took us 20 minutes - I have been told since that if you go to the Palatine entrance further down the road you may get in quicker. It is very crowded at first, but thins out as you go round. Highlights where the remains of the rostrum where Mark Antony made his \"Friends, Romans, Countrymen\" speech and the house and temple of the Vestal Virgins. It all suddenly seemed so real. Sadly there is nowhere to shelter if it rains (as it did very heavily) so if the weather looks bad do take umbrellas etc."

It probably rates more highly than the Colosseum for me.Recommend leaving enough time to fully explore the Capitoline hill and park area too."

This is a place where a lot of walking (more than I expected) takes place. This was also a tad bit more interesting (please don't hurt me others who may disagree) than the Colosseum. Do not get me wrong, the Colosseum inspires you and is beautiful to walk around in (you can see my review on that too) but this gives you a real idea of ancient Roman life. This is a large property and calls for walking on uneven paths, very inclined hills, stairs and rocky areas. There are areas that are easier to walk on for you folks with leg, knee or feet problems or parents with younger kids and strollers. However you won't get to see a lot of interesting sections. Even still, we spent several hours here and enjoyed it so much. Highly recommend it and can't wait to come back to Rome and see it all over again."

To stand at the site where so much history has transpired, including the murder of Julius Caesar, is incredible. In recent years, excavations have uncovered Augustus and Octavia Caesar's home. Tours just began this year. It is a true delight to see the living quarters of one of history's most famous figures. Take good walking shoes and pace yourselves.

We also went in May which meant we missed the crazy summer crowds and we had beautiful weather."

As mentioned previously the buildings and structures are amazing and the place oozes with history and the immense power and wealth depicted by the buildings. However, because the area has been built up over centuries and there are several 'layers' of Rome built upon each other, without a guided tour or structured audio guide you struggle to really understand the layout. Guided tours are expensive (there is definitely a market in Rome for minimising the info / details on standard tickets in order to force you in to paying for a guided tour). And the audio guide was as random/ confusing as the layout of the buildings. Go early as the queues are long are the crowds at the key view / photo opportunity places are 3-4 deep at peak times. Make sure you get the assistant to thoroughly explain the audio guide as they try to rush the queue through and if it stops working then you'll never re-find the function again. But still an amazing feeling of how Rome may have been like."

Not sure what I can add to 11,000 reviews other than this is the time to go as the crowds will be getting lighter.The Forum was the center of civilization for a good 500-1000 years depending on the dates you use, and although what you are seeing are the brick foundations of buildings, you don't need much imagination to cover them with marble and add thousands of ancient people. Every time I visit Rome I hit the Forum just to let my mind wander. There is so much to see that it's impossible to catch it all in one day.A tour with a knowledgeable English-speaking guide is recommended. I've done it with/without the audioguides and have found myself eavesdropping on the guides because the audioguide isn't easy to use and doesn't add much.The emperor Augustus once remarked that he had found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble. Much of that marble has been stripped and used in buildings throughout Rome (including the Vatican), but the bricks that remain are well worth the price of admission."

Irrespective of season, flat shoes are a good idea as there are cobblestone everywhere (not just in the Forum - a lot of Rome is cobbled).To get the most from a Forum visit, it is worth reading about the history in advance - there is information in English around the site but it is not particularly illuminating.

It's not just a single site or arena, but instead a series of buildings and gardens and pathways and just a big gathering spot for old world Rome. But do yourself two favors: (1) take your time. Set aside maybe two hours (more if you're really into it) to just slowly absorb it all. (2) Bring a guide book on the Forum, helping provide the background for all the different areas your walking through. Without a guidebook, you're just looking at ruins with no real context."

When getting your ticket and entering I strongly suggest going to the Palatine Hill entrance rather than the Roman Forum or Coliseum. When facing the Roman Forum entrance which is across from the Coliseums main entrance, Palatine Hill is to the left heading around the site. I guarantee the line will be much shorter and quicker. I would also recommend that if you don't have a guide, get an audio guide at the counter which is \u20ac5 from memory. Although most the ruins have information, there is so much more you can learn from the guide, even about the Emperors themselves. The only drawback from entering via Palatine Hill is you'll be listening to the audio guide's information in reverse order as it starts from Roman Forum, however I don't think this matters that much. If you really love your Roman history strap yourselves in for a long visit, we were there for 3 and a half hours and probably could've stayed even longer, there is a lot to see!"

The Palatine Hill has stunning views over the city and eventually over the Roman Forum. The ruins of the palace are stunning and in better condition that the Forum itself so it's such a shame that so many people don't visit the Palatine Hill.The forum is great, walking around you really feel like a Roman. Make the most of the map given to you and do a little research before you go because it really helps. Out of context it may just seem like a lot of rubble but when you know what each area was it becomes a lot more interesting.The whole area is outside so on hot days don't forget your sunscreen! There are much needed water fountains dotted around too and the water is lovely."

You can also buy a ticket combined with the Coliseum, but I had been there before so I did not. If the line across from the Coliseum is too long, walk around the block to another gate. Doing that decreased the wait for admittance from 45 minutes to under 5 minutes.Upon entrance, the best way to cover the area is to tour the Palatine Hill first, and then cover the Forum. That assures that most of your walk will be level or downhill. The stairway from the Palatine Hill to the Forum is long and steep; you don't want to climb it.You should be sure to take pictures of the Forum from the viewing area on the Palatine Hill. The views from up top are spectacular. Then head down and go to the Forum entrance to get the full experience.Be sure to bring a water bottle or cup with you. Numerous fountains are available where you can refill the water. The water in the fountains is safe to drink.Access to this attraction is easy from the Coliseum subway station. You should be careful around the station entrance. We inadvertently walked into the middle of a PLO protest. Fortunately it had full police coverage and was peaceful."

In this site one can see what is left of the Temple of Julius Caesar, the Curia, the tomb of Romulus, the Arch of Septimus Severus and the Rostrum where Shakespeare had Marc Antony give his \"Friends, Romans and Countyrmen\" speech.

Most of the tour guides I overheard did not give much additional information that wasn't on the placards. I used my Roma Pass to get in for free. The line was not long at all, about 5 minutes. It covers a lot of space and is on a hill so be prepared to walk around for a while. There are places you can sit and just enjoy the views.

We could have easily spent longer there as we are both very interested in ancient history, but on a hot day there's not a lot of shade and there's a lot of area to cover. We entered by the Via Sacra, near the Arch of Titus, which seemed to be the only place to grab an audio guide. Be aware that you must leave a form of ID and therefore have to come back to the same place before you leave. We arrived at open, 8:30am. There were no queues. The staff were nonchalant, almost to the point of rude but that is quite common at the tourist attractions in Italy. The audio guide was quite informative but tricky to use at times. It's like a little mobile phone and the map is on a different screen to the attractions so you're always switching around. There were also some errors and things that didn't match up, particularly in the Palatine Hill part. Also, it has a loud speaker, you don't really hold it to your ear like a lot of other audio guides, so you really only need one between two people. The ruins themselves are absolutely incredible. There are some great views over the forum from Palatine Hill. Thoroughly joyous to walk through a piece of ancient history and imagine what once was."

The Roman Forum (and the Palatine Hill, which shares the same entrance) is included in the same admission ticket to the Colosseum and is, to a certain extent, more interesting. The Roman forum is a collection of (ruins of) major structures (buildings, structures, memorials) of ancient Rome. On the top of my head, I remember the temple of Vesta, the Regia (the Royal residence), and the Curia (the meeting place of the Senate). Of particular interest was the Basilica Julia, an ancient structure that was converted into a church. It has several audio-visual stations where you can have a better glimpse - explanation of the ruins. Since it is indoors, some of its corridors provides a nice insulation from the heat, if you are visiting during the summer.On the minus site, we have some problems with the audio guide - it seems that some times it freezes, especially when using the gps. It was quite annoying, although it was relatively easy to solve by rebooting the device - the audio guide is simply a cheap smartphone with gps that runs continuously the guide app.A harder problem was to locate yourself in the map and select highlights without a pre-planned itinerary. You probably won't have stamina to see and listen to all stations in the audio guide, especially if you go during the hot months of summer. The problem is that most points of interest do not have a proper description on site, so you basically need to rely on your audio device. Also, it is not clear which path/route you should following, and it was a bit tricky to plan it on site.All in all, this is a must to do in Rome, but I think some homework needs to be done before the trip. Without proper explanations and descriptions, those ancient ruins would be no different than construction debris, which can become quite annoying, especially under high heat of the summer. I suggested studying the ruins and having your itinerary set, then have the audio device furnish the proper significance of the sites you are seeing. A guided tour with a human guide is also a great idea. As a suggestion, check the night tours that they offer during the hot months of summer, where in addition of the human guide, you would also benefit from the cooler night temperatures."

Like many other travellers I saw advice to buy admission for the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill in order to expedite entry into the Colosseum. Well I wanted to come back here and say that I found the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill WAY more interesting than the Colosseum. While not huge like Pompeii it was so interesting to wander around what essentially looks like an ancient town square. There was a variety of things to see as far as architecture and statues, along with a bit of natural beauty and pleasant panoramic views. There was also a museum display or two to see. Again, I found this visit much more pleasant and interesting than the Colosseum."

Note that sturdy shoes are a must because of the rough cobblestones. You can then take side strolls into the various areas along the main path. Expect heavy crowds and kids with selfie sticks making glamour shots to be in your way. Be sure to bring along a water bottle from your hotel.

The arches were used to commemorate victories and elections. The Forum was the nucleus of many activities including gladiator matches and public speeches, and became the showcase of the Roman Empire because of its statues and architecture. It was an important center of Roman activity. It was the place where individuals are allowed to express their views on anything. Only Roman adult males could speak at the Forum. The Forum was used for festivals and religious ceremonies."

Comprising an area of roughly one-quarter mile by less than one-fifth of a mile, it is a do-able walk and it is free (but the Colosseum admission will cost extra). It isn't possible to walk through the actual structural ruins themselves but getting close enough for some really good looks is possible. The Forum sits in a valley between the Capitoline and Palatine Hills. It was the hub for commercial, political, judicial and religious activities. This was the heart of ancient Rome.Entry is very close to the Arch of Titus and the end is a little ways past the Forum Square, close to the Temple of Saturn. The exit is close to the Arch of Septimus Severus. Just outside the exit lie the steps up to Capitoline Hill (there's an admission price to tour it).The Arch of Constantine and the Colosseum are located outside of the Forum's entry point.The Forum flourished for about 1,000 years (500 BC to 500 AD) and its demise was hastened by the active \"recycling\" program, scavenging materials for use elsewhere. In the Middle Ages, it was the local \"cattle field\". It took a Christian Pope to bring it back to life through excavations so that its lessons would not be lost.Signs along the way are particularly helpful in identifying the remnants of the various arches, structures, and fields. Packing along a tour book or getting an audio guide ($5 EU) might be helpful (we were on a guided tour) and allow for adequate time, maybe upwards of 1 1/2 hours (2 would be good) if you plan to actually read the signs in front of the monuments.This should go without saying but ... wear a hat and sunscreen, dress comfortably (shoes with sturdy soles), pack water along, and take your time. This is not an Olympic event.There is no way to convey the enormity of the structures and how small and insignificant one can feel when seeing the whole of the Forum revealed for the first time."

The ticket you get for the Coliseum can cover the Forum and Palatine Hill. It is really a better visit with a qualified guide. You can get a personal tour with a guide for 70 Euros an hour which covers the tickets and three hours is plenty. There is a scanner and security line for the Forum which took less than minutes to go through.It is so easy to not get what you are looking at without a guide."

We were lucky enough to even see some archaeologists on a dig. The temples, the arches, the various pillars, the house of the vestels, the stadium; it's all there in one big massive place. Tips: As usual bring a bottle of water and don't be afraid to run out as there are heaps of water filling stations around the forum thanks to the various aqua ducts. It is going to be hot, so bring sunscreen and a cap. Remember to spare 4 to 5 hours to check the whole place out.Finally; make sure you buy a ticket from the forum before you go to the Colleseo, the queue is smaller and entry into the forum will give you a fast pass to enter the Colleseum."

We visited the forums late one evening and discovered the light and sound shows running at both the Augustus and Caesar Forums through October. There is very little publicity around this for some reason but both shows are spectacular :- The intent of the shows is to tell the story of the monument and rulers with the help of 3D light projections and wonderful sound effects. The shows run either every hour (Augustus Forum) or every 20 mins (Caesar's Forum) and start around 8 pm each night- Tickets are available at 15 Euros for each show or a combined 25 Euro ticket to both. Tickets can be bought either right in front of Augustus forum or at the Trajan Column near Caesar's forum. Booking online for Caesar's show is recommended as only 20 people are permitted per show and tickets sell out quickly.- The Augustus forum show is more like sitting in an auditorium with projections in front of you while Caesar's forum show is more interactive and you walk through the ruins. Audio headsets are provided for both shows with ability to choose preferred language.These shows are a very good opportunity to understand more about the ancient Roman history in a fun and cool way. Sadly, they are running only for limited time but do try to catch them if your schedule permits."

Not far from the Colosseum, this ancient part of Rome is stunning when you consider half the world was administrated from these buildings.

You can walk for miles around these ruins. Well worth seeing. We avoided the guided tour as we bought guide books before we came to Italy but the tours are cheap enough. You can browse at your leisure with a good guide book though and tours tend to rush you through. Augustus' market, Trajan's column, Dopoglio Museum and Colosseum are all within walking distance of the Foro Romani. Piazza Venizia is also within the same area.

Water is not allowed inside as there's an airport style security check at entry. Suggest doing this just after Colosseum and if you are short on time or effort to walk and have to pick any one between palantine hill and Roman Forum, go for Forum.

            "review": "A walk through Ancient Rome's city centre. The best way to enter the Roman Forum is via Palatine Hill- I would highly suggest buying a collective ticket for entrance into Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum rather than buying on the day (go to the official ticketing website 'coopculture [dot] it' for your options). The line for entering these significant ancient grounds is long enough with a pre-bought ticket (with security scans being the main reason for delay into the site), so you can imagine how long it might take if you also need to line up to purchase a ticket as well!Despite much of the evidently enormous structures that used to once stand in the Roman Forum being long gone, it is not hard to imagine how impressive and grand the Roman Forum must've once been from what IS still standing. For example, the front portico standing from the remains of The Temple of Saturn and the Arch of Septimius Severus still looms majestically against the sky and they are examples of exemplary roman architecture and design.The ruins that you see as you walk through and explore the site will probably not mean much to the uninformed visitor as there are few detailed signs around the site, but if you are sincerely interested in what the remains of each ginormous building used to be, their purpose and significance, then there are audio and guidebooks that you are able to purchase to guide you through. While you only see what remains of a great and powerful ancient empire today, it is not hard to imagine how incredible the Roman Forum must've been at its peak and what a sight to behold it must have been. The Roman Forum along with Palatine Hill covers an enormous amount of ground, so make sure you bring water to keep fully hydrated, a hat and sunscreen to protect yourself from the sun and good walking shoes!"

It would be hard to fully appreciate this place on your own. Take a water bottle, heaps of places to fill it up. The forum is very exposed and it gets very hot! Only small vending machines (self-bars) to buy food so take your own, or hold on until later! Wear good waking shoes, lots of climbing and uneven cobblestones.

Roman forum is so huge and it takes atleast a day to roam around at easy pace. There are so many artifacts and piece of history not to be missed when ur here. Sadly I was on a hot sunny day and got really sweaty. It would be better to plan it towards evening time as weather gets better. Otherwise recommended place for sure n not to be missed."

There is a recently discovered ancient church previously buried beneath another church which was very exciting for our guide. This ticket can be purchased together with the Colosseum ticket and it is smart to do this on line prior to your visit. Saves so much time!"

No need to come earlier than the 8.30 gate opening time if you already have your ticket ( buy online and use for colosseum too). No security check so entry is quick and you can bring water ( many fountains and clean toilets inside). At 8.30 we were wandering the streets completely alone for a few mintues which was awe inspiring. We were not impressed with colosseum audio guide so downloaded the Rick Steves guide for the Roman Forum. That was fantastic, I really recommend it, but be aware it doesn't cover Pallatine hill. Really wish we had an audio guide for that too. We were here / on the hill from 8.30 to 12 and didn't look at the ruins on the hill in detail, or visit Pallatine museum. With a picnic lunch you could easily spend the entire day here. Equally, you can brush over some parts and do it in a morning. The ground is loose red dirt, our feet and legs were filthy when we left. I was glad to be wearing sandals as easily rinsed my feet down. Plenty of shade but of course it is pretty hot from 10 onwards in August."

It is a huge site, very interesting to know that this was the heart of life in ancient Rome, very impressive and you can see the wealth the Romans had of everything. What was not so impressive was the toilet situation. With so many visitors coming to the site, hundreds and hundreds of tourists. There are a few toilets for the men and only 2 toilets for women, one of which is a disabled one. The mens toilets, my husband was in the queue when the women attendants were cleaning them and they closed most of them and left only 2 I think open and that was because my husband insisted that they not close the second one! On the woman's side I waited for at least 45 minutes as there was only one toilet open of the 2 that should have been available! The disabled one. I presume the women attendants had done the same, the cleaned one and closed it! Come on this is not on, there were small children and old ladies waiting to use the toilets. These women came to where we were queing as they had a cupboard at the back or something and they saw the big queue getting bigger and they just left without opening the toilets smiling and smoking! It looked as if they were laughing at us at the queue. They should be fired for treating tourists this way. This is inhuman! Only one women's toilet in the whole forum with so many visitors! This didn't seem like a city in Europe, on a touristic site! This was worse than a third rate country! And something should be done. I complained to our guide as did others and the guide said they had already complained to the authorities! The Colisseum I have been told is the same!"

A must-see when in Rome but time consuming as well. With a day in Rome we only had time for the Trevi Fountain and the Colisseum which we went to on the underground. Beware of pickpockets as we did have an incident on the underground but fortunately nothing came of it as the pickpocket chose the wrong pocket but the three women involved were thrown off the underground by a local who came to our rescue. We already knew about it and had taken our precautions. They usually target foreign men."

Be careful which walking tour your book as the one we were on had over 80 people on it making it hard to hear the group leader speak. It was disappointing to hear that majority of the Roman forum was destroyed to build Vatican City as in its full glory would have been spectacular."

A plethora of ruins; a town, a home, a palace, a shop... You could feel the history seeping from every brick. It was quite unbelievable really, the sheer amount of columns...with their intricate details just strewn about the place....1000s of years old. It was however midday, so very hot with little shade. If you're older & or need rest, perhaps you have children, this may be a little struggle to get through it all! Fortunately they have the 'self-serve bar' aka a vending machine so getting our hands on water was never a problem. A must, is to walk to the top of an old building which has a gorgeous garden and viewing platform. The views are extraordinary. There is this most magical spring that also drips down off the rock side into a pool in a cavern, and then as you walk up the stairs, it presents itself again as another pool - it almost defies gravity. The information all had an English version, which I found to not be the case at all sites...so this meant you could really engage with all aspects. A real opportunity of a lifetime."

At the Forum we walked around some then came across this small tunnel and went through it. There was an open field with not much to view. We continued reluctantly and found a hill top with a lot of ruins and a museum. The whole are was really neat but we enjoyed the museum the most."

My tip for seeing the Roman Forum is to have a fantastic guide to help you bring the forum back to life. This is the second time I have done the forum in three years. The first time the guide was very factual and that was it, which was interesting, but felt a bit like a history lesson in school by the end and you just couldn't wait for the lunch bell. This time around, we had a guide (Marco from the Nederlands) and he was also factual but a good story teller. He told it like a story and got us involved in the story and I learnt so much more and it also became a memorable experience. Tip: Get a good guide, it will mean so much more."

The Forum was the center of commercial activity. One of the important areas was the complex of the Vestal Virgins. The baths as well as 2 of the fire pits are still in place. This was located right below Palatine Hill where the emperor lived. To get to the Forum from the Colosseum, you have to walk on the ancient road. It is awesome to walk where Romans actually walked.

Yes, even though it was free, we still had to stand in line to get an actual ticket and then go through the security section.I brought along my trusty Rick Steve's book and it was really helpful in giving us info about everything. There aren't too many placards otherwise.It's a big place, with some shade, but be prepared for lots of sun in the summer! You can buy cold drinks at a vending machine sort of located in the middle of it all.

We went in the morning before lunch (arrived at about 10:30 or so) and the place had barely any people around so we could walk around in the lovely quiet and enjoy the views without them being obscured. It is such a beauty where you can see different things from the place where the homes of those who lived there to where the shops would have been and even the garden at the top (beautiful, must go there even if you are afraid of heights just stay away from the edge and you will feel fine as its just like another floor on a building and you are standing in the middle. Sometimes you forget how high you are. Please take this from someone who is very afraid of heights). At the top there is 3 machines where you can get food and drink (which is thankfully cold) to find it you need to walk to the back of the gardens (if you are coming from the hard route) but there is a sigh next to the toilets by the garden showng you the way. Near the machines, there are a couple of benches in the shade of trees where you can relax for a bit especially on a hot day in the company of the singing birds. This is something you would have to give yourself a few hours depending how fast you walk the route you take (they have different ones depending on your ability to walk. If you arent good with stairs or inclines go the green route. Its a bit longer than the harder ones but brings you to the same place) but also on when you go as it would be a bit longer when more people are there. I would recommend about 2 to 3 hours if you go in the morning and miss the main traffic as you get the best experience then but if you go later pre book your tickets to miss the long queue like any place you want to visit in Rome where you have to buy a ticket."

On top of the Palatine Hill is Caesar Augustus's home and it is still complete and in tact. You can see how this ruler lived and don't miss his escape tunnel in case he was attacked. There are two important arch's here. One is the arch of Titus and I do not remember the name of the other. You can almost visualize the shoppers milling about at the stoah's or stores as we know them. Just arched holes in the walls for each store person to sell his wares. On the far side of the forum heading away from downtown Rome you can still find one of the old roman red brick roads with ruts made by the chariots. We bought a guide to the forum and went on our own, I think we saw more than the tours did...they are limited time wise, we were not.

Our guide brought us around the main ruins, including the place Julius Cesear was cremated, Septimus Severus' Arch and then through the Basilica Julia to an ancient church which was buried for 1000 years after an earthquake. This has been open to the public since March 2016 & has an incredible light show which highlights the different layers of frescoes from different eras that they uncovered.

That was really amazing! Roman forum is next to Palatine Hills and Coloseum. I recommend that first you can visit Coloseum, next Palatine hill and next Roman forum, because Palatine hill and Roman forum are connected and from Palatine hill you can have a pretty nice view of Roman forum and then you can go visit it. The ticket is the same for Coloseum, Palatine hill and Roman forum at 16euros. All of them need about 5-6 hours to be seen. I really recommend it"

If you don't have tickets, recommend going to the side entrances (vs the one across from the Colosseum). There was a long line at the one across the Colosseum and we walked right in through the side entrance. Considering we were going to walk across the Forum, this allowed us to see more of the Forum inside and not double back. Wonderful way to spend several hours."

Easily one could spend a few hours exploring the area. What surprised us was that up on the hillside was a lot of shade and nice breezes, which was appreciated on a hot August afternoon. The Forum is directly across from the Colosseum so it is easy to take in both on the same day, just allow for plenty of time. If I had to choose between the two, I would visit the Forum because of the many different areas and structures. There are many markers with information explaining the history and buildings which is handy when following the printed guide. A great day spent there and enjoyed by all in our group."

I believe this place touches anyone that visits - whether you like history or not. Included in one ticket is the Colosseum and the Forum (a bunch of preserved Roman buildings located beside the Colosseum should you not know exactly what this refers to), so you don't have to worry about buying multiple tickets.The Colosseum is a true gem. Such history preserved. The lines were decently long, but not unbearable. There were several lines to choose from as many people chose to visit with a guide. We decided to visit ourselves, and not purchase tickets beforehand. It seemed to work well for us as we went in the morning to miss the biggest crowds in the afternoon. When visiting the Colosseum, there are two levels open to the general public - make sure you see things from the lower and upper levels as you experience things slightly different and get great shots from the varying locations. They have water spouts (comes out of a hose) for you to fill your water bottle up. Great drinking water for the price ;) (ie free).The forum is quite big and fully outside. It's hot, so make sure you bring lots of water as there are no fountains or drinking stations like in the Colosseum. It took us several hours to visit the whole thing. There is lots to see and lots of variation in the buildings. Things seemed to flow well and crowds were well dispersed when we went - never felt crowded or jammed packed. There are no real information plaques or anything to provide a background, so know your stuff beforehand, or go in just to appreciate the architecture - either way, you'll enjoy yourself.The place is located close to a bus stop (although we walked from the place we were staying) so it's accessible via public transportation.Plan on staying half a day to a full day there if you want to take your time, appreciate what you're seeing, and seeing it all. It's not a place you can only spend an hour or two at.Let me know if you found this helpful! Thanks!"

The Roman Forum or Forum Romanum is a rectangular plaza surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome.

While we were having a rest here we suddenly became invaded by a local tour, but we stayed and listened and found the experience very informative.We then walked back to the bottom and took a walk through the site from ground level. The area is stunning and people are still excavating the ruins. You can see the place where Caesar was cremated at the time Rome was a republic, and then see how Octavian (Augustus) created the modern Rome that we see today.

We visited in July so if you go at a similar time be prepared for it to be hot and dusty. The forum needs a lot of time, I reckon you could spend all day here and more but I believe most people give a half day because it does get to the point where you find yourself saying inwardly 'oh look a boulder on the ground, another column'. Cynical as this sound, I know, but there are a lot of columns and a lot of debris all over as you would expect at a ruin. I am just trying to give an honest view. I like history but don't love it, so this place impressed me and I can see how you could spend loads of time here but if you're on a time budget you need to be strict with yourself and I'd say half a day is enough!"

It is not easy to move around these ruins without having some knowledge of the 10 centuries of history, from the 6th century BC to the Byzantine age, only then the monuments become meaningful. You can only close your eyes and imagine how grand this Forum was with its majestic columns and sculptures. A word of advise, you should go on a guided tour of these wonderful ruins. Only then, you will be able to appreciate all its greatness."

I highly recommend a guide to really learn the most about not only the ruins and architecture of this place but also the time period and how many words/ ideas come from that time. This is a a amazing place and HUGE and hot and crowded. I am SOOO glad we went. But here are some recommendations:It gets hot- wear a hat, go Early, wear sunscreen and cool clothes, bring WATER. Go with a tour group. We used a Viator tour and it was excellent. We got so much info. Otherwise you are just staring at ruins. Granted, you can use a tour book but it's so huge, you could wander all day - a tour guide helps you go directly to the things you want to see. I almost Never use a tour guide - I'm a Rick Steves fan and usually just use his books. But - this one is worth it - both to \"skip the line\" but also to get so much extra info and know which ruins to look at and to learn about. There are bathrooms and water fountains but they are few and far between so bring water. Also- the tour we booked through Viator- for both Colosseum and Forum was excellent. Didn't make it to much on Palatine hill but allowed you to continue on your own after your tour. We chose to get lunch somewhere cool instead. It's a lot of walking in the heat. I was told no strollers and we have little kids so that was frustrating because there were tons of other people with Strollers. Our tour guide kept showing us pictures of the ruins we were looking at and then side by side a picture of what it might have looked like back then Very Helpful!!I highly recommend the Viator tour!!

The area where the church of Santa Maria Antiqua is located has been closed for all my previous visits, and thus it was a delight to find it open, and portrayed in astonishing way using modern technic to show how it was in early days. Besides the history of the church the access is now given to places to show how the Palatine Hill and Capitoleum were connected.

If you are visiting Rome for the first time and maybe don't think you will get another chance, then the two sites you must see are the Forum and the Vatican. The Forum is the center of ancient Rome, basically the cradle for much of what eventually developed into Western civilization. Did you know a \"basilica\" started out not as a church but in ancient Rome as a large public meeting hall where many legal proceedings were held? In the Forum you will see the remains of the huge Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine, to the right after you enter past the Arch of Titus. You can also see the spot where Julius Caesar was cremated and the rostrum where Marc Antony made his famous oration at Caesar's funeral. You can stroll the Via Sacra and imagine a glorious Triumph parade winding around the Palatine and down the Via Sacra towards the Capitoline.We visited at the height of tourist season in mid July 2016, and it was crowded. There is really no reason to pre-purchase tickets (which give entry to the Forum, the Colosseum and the Palatine Hill) on the web. Just go to the ticket office at the Palantine Hill entrance a couple of hundred yards south of the Arch of Constantine. Even with enormous lines at the Colosseum and the Forum ticket offices, very few tourists are interested in the Palatine so the line there is really short.However, unless you are freakishly knowledgable about ancient Rome, you must use some kind of guide when touring the Forum. Otherwise it's the equivalent of touring the remains of a city bombed to rubble. Very little is labeled, so you won't know what you are looking at. You could join a tour, in which case you don't need to worry about tickets but you can't explore on your own. We used Rick Steve's free audioguide downloaded to our phones. It's pretty good and did help us understand what we were seeing and imagine the grandeur of the Forum in its heyday.The Forum is ideal for history buffs and anyone remotely interested in ancient Rome. I wouldn't recommend it for young children since the walk around can be long and hot in the summer with very little shade and nothing a youngster can really relate to. High school and college age kids should appreciate it.For a fantastic panoramic view of the Forum, go to the Capitoline Museum, cross underneath the Campidoglio plaza to the northern wing of the museum, and make your way out onto the balcony overlooking the Forum."

We didn't have to wait in line for more than 10 minutes to buy a ticket (witch is very cheap). And it's a very smart idea to buy a combination ticket for the Coloseum because the lines there are endless. With the combi ticket you have 2 days to visit both and the line at the Coloseum is remarkably shorter than the line without a ticket. Once inside the Forum you can walk around for a day. We had over 35\u00b0C so we took time to cool down every now and then in the shade. But what an amazing sight! The ruins of the old temples and the bricks of the old roads...you can imagine perfectly how life was in the ancient city...the centre of the trade. We were just speechless looking at the architectural achievements and walking in the middle of them. Visiting the Forum teaches you more about history then any book will do.

Since it is huge and with a lot to see, I would recommend 5 to 6 hours just there. With the same ticket you can go to the Coliseum and also to the Palatine. As far as I can remember, tickets are valid for 2 consecutive days. We went with three children, including one baby. I do not recommend you to take pushchair there because there are a lot of steps to climb and the pavement is very irregular; once it is an ancient site. I also recommend that you take some snacks because they don't sell anything there. There is a water fountain where you can fill water bottles. Don't forget to bring sun cream, hat and sunglasses with you. Totally worth going."

The Roman Forum is one of the three big historical attractions that you can visit on a multi-pass ticket, that also includes the Colosseum (although you must queue again to visit that site due to enhanced security measures), so if ancient rocks are your thing, this is a must-see.I'm not quite sure where the Forum began as we just flowed into it from the ruins and gardens of Palatine Hill, situated just above.There are so many glorious photo opportunities to be found, there's something new to see looking up, down, along, in the shade in the sun - take plenty of camera film or a big SD card!One of the great things about Rome are the constantly running drinking fountains dotted around the city that allow you to refill your water bottle for free - the Forum has a couple of these taps plus toilet facilities within the site.Given that this is one of three attractions on your very good value ticket, it's easy to skip round so quickly that you don't really look at things, you just see them through your view finder... Well good news: your ticket is valid for two days! We didn't return the next day, there is far too much to see with just four days in Rome, but if you've been to this city before, seen the Vatican and the Spanish Steps, for the price, you won't find a better two days of Entertainment."

The site is large and has a number of small sites/museums you can spend time in. The ruins are extensive and amazing. - Almost impossible to take a bad picture, but show up early if you can, especially during the summer/high seasons to reduce the crowds. - When hot (30+ degrees), water is essential. There were no vendors inside the site that we saw. There were a few fountains if you have an empty bottle. Water would be a good idea, even when not hot. - We'd skip the audio guide next time, as the numbers didn't sync with the map, so it was cumbersome and didn't add to our experience. Also, if you rent the audio you have to leave ID, which means you have to leave by the same gate you entered, cutting down your options. - Plan to do the Coliseum right after (it is right there), unless the crowds are too big or you're too tired. - The combined ticket works for the Coliseum if you buy it and is valid for two days, so you can come back the next day.

Roman Forum along with Palatine Hill and Colosseum forms the trinity of attractions at one site and have one entry ticket applicable for them. While this place is full of ruins from the Roman era with tons of history buried inside, people are more attracted to the colosseum next door and this would get a casual look around at the best and so is the case with Palatine Hill. The scorching sun in the summer months makes this even worse and pushes the people to hurry up and end up at Colosseum.However, if you have ample time and a keen historian, please take a guided tour and your plate will be full with historic facts!!!"

That was a really strenous long walk among all these ruins, that used to be first in Roman Kingdom, then in Roman Republic and finally in Roman Empire, important ancient government buildings at the very center of Rome, we may say in its core. Under the scorching sun, we nevertheless slow proceeded from one architectural fragment or vestige to another, looking attentively at each one.This whole place is situated in small valley between Palatine Hill on the southeast and Capitoline Hill on the northwest.In fact, it forms a rectangular forum ( plaza) surrounded now by the ruins not only government buildings but also the different temples, museums, basilicas, antiquariums, carceres or prisons and stretched central plane used to be a market place where all Roman public life had been undertaken.And what looked like such Roman life ? Here, there were the triumphal processions and elections, then public speeches, criminal trials, gladiatorial matches and surely the commercial affairs which were carried out between the different parties.We've seen also here the intermittent archaeological excavations.The oldest structures representing the royal residences are The Regia, the Temple of Vesta ( godess of the hearth and its sacred fire), the complex of the Vestal Virgins and many more.Later in Roman Republic and Empire were built the shrines and temples honored to greatest Roman Emperors as Julius Caesar, Augustus, Constantine the Great and others.Good to see and refresh the memory of what we were taught in our school days."

A lot of people seemed to skip through it really fast and I can only assume they either didn't care for it or didn't bother to get the audio guide. My friends and I spent a good 5 hours listening to all the points on the audio guide and taking in all the history in the Forum and the Hill (about 3 hours in the Forum and 2 on the Hill). Take food and water with you especially if it is hot and you have kids - the Roman Forum and the Paletine Hill are an 'all in one' site and while there are 2-3 public water fountains, the only place to buy food, or cold drinks are vending machines, one set at the Forum and one up on Paletine Hill. By the end of the day both sets were sold out of water or had stopped working and were eating people's money. Beware the machines that say that they don't give cash. This means they don't give change and I lost 5 euro to one of these as I didn't know that meant no change when it had a change compartment on the panel! One of my friends had a coffee from the machine and thought it was pretty good. A lot of the Forum and Hill area was looted back in the Renaissance and later, so don't expect perfectly preserved buildings in all their original glory, but it still remains a fascinating place to visit to get a feeling for how the center of Rome operated in its heyday."

The heart of the ancient city that ruled the Mediterranean world is an absolute must see! Make sure you buy a ticket online and print at home to avoid long lines, especially in summer. The ticket is combined with a visit to the palatine hill, the home of the Roman republican aristocracy and later the sight of the imperial palace. I recommend to first climb and explore the palatine and then slowly descend into the forum. There are a number of Terraces with spectacular views of the entire forum and colosseum. Take some lovely pics and descend in the forum, walk the Via Sacra and explore the many remains of temples and churches. The latest site is the Santa Maria Antiqua, an imperial atrium which later became one of he first Christian churches. Beautifully restored wth some amazing early frescoes. At the foot of the hill it is connected with the emperor's ramp leading to the palace on the palatine. Fascinating!Hot, Exclusive tip: If you want to avoid the massive lines under the hot Roman sun, use the palatine hill entrance on Via di San Gregorio, which runs between the colosseum and the circus maximus. There's barely any people entering from that side. Be smart!Been to the forum 4 times and keep going back. It's very special. Give yourself tome to enjoy it and let your imagination run wild.

The Forum is just a ways from the Colosseum and the ticket will allow you to see both the Forum and Palatine Hill. I suggest you arrive early, bring good shoes, water, and enjoy! You can easily spend 3-4 hours here if you want to see all the sights. The Forum itself is quite large and some of the ruins tower above you. It's quite something to see!"

Our Rome pass allowed us dedicated line for quick entry to the site.There are continuous restorations happening and you can see how they have worked to maintain this piece of living history.We arrived at first opening on a cloudy day and we were admitted immediately. If you arrive early before the worst of the crowds you can see entire site in about two to four hours depending on your interest, tolerance and footwear. My travel partner wanted to walk in the steps of the Roman greats and this we certainly did. I tried to listen to some podcasts guides while we got our bearings. I always find the tone of these guides to be unbearable. Another unforgettable site to visit in Rome. Remember to bring drinks and a snack as nothing is available within the site."

Go up to the Campidoglio (this is the square on Capitoline hill right behind the Vittoriano \"wedding cake\" Monument\") then walk down the far corner on the left. You will come out very very close to the enormous Septimus Severus arch, and will have an opportunity for wonderful photos."

Downtown ancient Rome!No really, Foro Romano (Roman Forum) is essentially the downtown of the capital that used to ruled over the vast Roman Empire. Sadly, downtown ancient Rome was left to deteriorate and even faced deliberate destruction as people used to dismantle for free building materials. Fortunately, some remains, possibly because they are harder to move.However, to the untrained eyes without pre-trip studying, Foro Romano is nothing more than random columns and rocks...Yet if you read only for a bit or even just take the time to read the few explanation blurbs and look up Google Maps on the spot, you will be awed that you are standing so close to so much history! How amazing is it to pass by what remains of the prison that once held Saints Peter and Paul? How crazy is to casually walk through the remains of the HQ of Roman Curia, once the world's most powerful political entity? Or perhaps it's nothing compared to the remnant of the grand basilica* that would make St. Peter's Basilica look like a parish church, right?To many people, the Roman Forum is merely the necessary path to reach the iconic Colosseum, but I highly suggest you do a brief reading of Roman history or a quick search on Google on the spot as you walk through here because I think this is the definitive proof that makes Rome the Eternal City and it would be a shame to walk through these historically significant sites assuming that they are nothing more than rocks.*\"Basilica\" used to mean large assembly hall but it's now more commonly used as a designation of church buildings*The scope of this review covers both the free and ticketed portions of the Roman Forum---PAID PART OF THE ROMAN FORUMSome parts particularly the more complete sections are ticketed. The admission cost is \u20ac12 for a combined admission to access the Colosseum and Palatine Hill for 48 hours. Buying the ticket here first is actually the best way to bypass the long wait at the Colosseum!---tl;dr version:1) Remnant of ancient Rome's downtown2) Remains of many historically significant sites2) Needs some knowledge or Google search to fully appreciate"

Buy your combo ticket (Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palantine Hill) at the Palantine Hill entrance down the street from the Colosseum- much shorter line. This was amazing too much to take in in a quick trip. The grounds are massive. With only two exits/entrances, you can spend almost as much time finding your way out as you spent touring the sights. Drop a pin with your phone at the entrance you use. It will save your tired feet when you're ready to go. Take a map when you enter. It's helpful. Bring lots of water and a few snacks. You'll want to take breaks in the shade when you find it. There's an indoor museum within an ancient church. Go in. It's a nice air conditioned break from the heat, and when you climb to the top observation deck, you have an amazing view of the entire complex. I think I enjoyed the Roman Forum and Palantine Hill more than the Colosseum."

Everyone has to report to the ticket booth for a ticket, so you can't send one person to get them. You all have to go.Despite the queue being long, we only had to queue for about 20 minutes in the end.There are signs letting you know which routes are which and which are easy/medium (Forum) or hard (Palantine Hill). We didn't do the latter due to lack of time. I was wearing flip flops and was fine walking round.We've all seen the ruins on to but it's much larger in reality. The temple is amazing and dominates the site. There are plenty of info boards. They have also provided areas of shade which were very welcome in a 35 degree heat.

Sure you can do that for free, but with a ticket you get to walk throughout the Forum and come face-to-face with the intact Senate House, the ruins of the Temple of Caesar, and so many other amazing structures. If you're an archaeology and history nut like me, consider taking a guided tour (spring for the House of Augustus tour!) and then coming back the next day on your own just to wander around. The guided tours are great, but they cover so much that you don't get time to explore and take it all in. Side note: to see where Caesar was actually assassinated, go to the cat sanctuary about 20 minutes walk from the Forum. It's built around the ruins of the Theater of Pompey (temporary senate house at the time), and there's a pine tree growing at the spot where he was stabbed to death!"

There seems to be an important new artefact around every corner, and despite the heat (early July in Rome is not designed for those from a cool climate) there was plenty to keep us happy, with shade and free water readily available. The new exhibition of medieval frescoes is also excellent."

Only in the last few centuries has it all been excavated for us to enjoy. This is a walk right down from Palatine Hill via steps, and we did this on a tour in the daytime that was a combo with the Colosseum and Palatine Hill through Walks of Italy. Original statues and buildings are there. All three places were close together and not to be missed when you are in Rome. This is another place that is probably best done with a guide or you really won't appreciate who the buildings belonged to or what their purpose was in ancient times. The guides have wonderful stories that you can imagine being right in the moment. Wonderful photo opportunities of Roman ruins. I believe the Forum is closed at night, so if you do a combo tour, it has to be in the daytime or you'll just get a distant view, which is not the same experience at all. No cover up required for any of these since they are not religious sites. Our teenager found these interesting as well."

It seemed that everyone picking up tickets had issues of some sort. Even though we entered early in the day there were no site maps available. Our tickets said they were good for two days, so we did a quick walk through the Forum on the way to the Colosseum thinking that we would return for a more relaxed and thorough exploration later. As soon as we got outside the gate we realized that we could not get back in with those tickets. It was our fault for not having been more careful reading the fine print, but really, what is the point of a two day ticket that can only be used for one admission?"

So not fully knowing which ruin you're looking at and maybe how it used to look i think makes you miss a dynamic. But that aside its a great location bang in the centre of Rome. The fact that some columns are still standing thousands of years later blows my mind. It's quite a large area and if like us you walked everywhere in Rome it gets quite tiring but definitely get to the view point and look out over Rome and the ruins below they are stunning."

I started to think that half of it was just left there to make an attraction out of it. Like a broken small piece of pilar (about 8 feet in length) left with grass growing around it that had been cornered off with no explanation. If you are short of time don't worry about skipping, there is far more to see in Rome that is more worthy of your time."

No one tells you about it at the entrance but having read about it we were lucky enough to view this extraordinary excavation. It is included in your ticket and closes this October for some reason.Be aware that there are no maps at all and it's very hard to find things like toilets, with staff giving completely wrong directions..we had to ask tour guides (not ours) where things were as Staff extremely unhelpful.

You can relax on top of the hill as there is a beautiful park (Giardani Farnese)Plus, you get a great view from Roma and the Colosseo (from Palatin).Pack a lunch though, because the only thing you'll eat is a bag of chips or peanuts (vending machines).Oh, and bring a bottle of water, there are plenty of fountains on-site to refill (sunny and 36 degrees celsius when we visited).Enjoy!"

Our guide warned us to watch our things and told us pick pockets pose as tourists with a map and things. We had stopped at the spring fountain for water and when we were listening to our English speaking guide a young man walked into our group and asked what language is this in English. Red flag for me! He seemed to be alone, had a map and half empty water bottle, he would act interested and touch his phone like he was taking a photo but it was not on camera mode. He walked with us for the rest of our tour and we all were aware of him and kept an eye on him. When one of our friends went to take a photo with both hands on her camera in a small space where Cesar was burned he got next to her. Another friend saw what was happening and moved in, she put her hand on our friends purse and moved her away from him. She said he gave her the evil eye. We're pretty sure that the other young lady in the area was working with him, but he got nothing from us. The Forum has alot of interesting sites to see, just be aware of others near you. The pick pockets do this every day there, it's their job!"

This time I did and I must say it's one of the best experiences I have ever had. I planned to spend the afternoon around the Colosseum area and I saw this package deal of tickets for Colosseum and an extra site. I decided to go for it as thinking that it's a budget save. The site was amazing. We visited the place in April time, and the weather was absolutely perfect during the afternoon - not too hot and there was plenty of sunshine. The weather got chilly only after 6 p.m., which was around the time when the site was closing. As a photography lover, I was crazy taking photos around the site and enjoying the historical learning. Palantine Hill was just on a hill next to Roman Forum. I heard from some people that the choice of visiting palantine Hill only is better than Roman Forum as it could allow them to have a full view of Roman Forum anyway. I am not sure whether I would have changed my mind if I had chosen Palantine Hill instead, but at least I know the actual walking experience in Roman Forum was absolutely worth it. I spent 1 hour there until the site was closed. If you are a historian or photography lover, I would recommend at least 2 hours of visit at this place."

It's not as busy as the colosseum but again the best time to go is early as there is no crowds and you have plenty of time to walk around and get great photos with out people getting in the way. There is a little indoor museum/chapel towards the end of the site.. I highly recommend checking it out as there is some amazing ancient paintings on the walls and creepy music that really makes you feel like your in the moment. I arrived at around 8am for the opening time of 8:30am.. To be honest I probably could have rocked up at 8:15-8:20 as I was the only one with the online ticket, everyone else was queuing to buy one.

Be warned--this is a vigorous activity--there are completely uneven street surfaces and very steep stairs, many of them. Do yourself a favor and forego the expensive audio handset tour--the handset is a pain to use and we just gave up on ours. They also make you leave an ID for the handsets so that you must return them to that exact spot later on, which is very inconvenient because the complex is so large and has other exits you may prefer. So stick to the map they give you which is pretty good. The signs inside will explain most things anyway, also making the audio handset redundant."

            "review": "Practical hints for your Roman Forum visit. It goes without saying that the Roman Forum is an iconic site of the ancient city, and a must-see at least once in your life. So my comments here relate to the best way/time to visit this amazing location.If you are visiting under your own steam, I would recommend that you combine your visit with a look around the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum. You should allow something like two to four hours for the whole thing, depending on your eye for detail, allowance for breaks, interest level, and stamina. 3. For an independent combination visit, it is far better to go mid-afternoon (in the summer, at least) -- say about three o'clock. Start at the Palatine Hill ticket office (along Via di San Gregorio). At this time of day there should be no queue for buying tickets, which admit you to the Palatino, the Forum, and the Colosseum (12 Euros for the lot). This is because the Palatino is the least visited of the three sites, and anyway most group tours and individuals insist on going in the morning. Walk up the gentle slopes to the ruins, take a look around (really bad signage, so a guide book would help). Then make your way to the viewpoint over the Forum -- a quite amazing sight! And then descend the steps down to the Forum itself (which if you reverse the order of this visit is quite an upward hike in the summer heat).4. Look around the Roman Forum. Better signage here, but still not great. After you have had your fill, head over in the direction of the Colosseum, where you will find an exit (exit only, not entrance) that takes you just a couple of hundred meters to the Colosseum entrance point. Here, you join the (at 4 or 5 pm non-existent) queue for ticket holders (you show the same ticket you bought at the Palatine Hill). Whereas the queue to BUY tickets here is long, even at this late hour. Soon you are inside, and while there are still crowds around you will find very few groups since they all go in the morning or at lunch time. Spend as long as you like inside, and when you exit, you can walk around the outside of the Colosseum taking photos in the late afternoon/evening sunshine (the whole site closes at 7:15pm in summer months).That's it. Hope this helps you enjoy your visit!"

I know people LOVE the Forum and it was very interesting but only if you are in Rome for many days and have seen everything else. Trip Advisor is all opinion based and this is my opinion. I have been to Rome five times and on my 5th visit this year I did make it to the Forum. I enjoyed myself very much but was so glad I hadn't wasted time on my other trips when there is so much else to do in Rome that I feel is higher on the list. Remember in the summer it is very hot, not much shade and dirt. Wear great shoes (not sandles or open toe), bring a hat and water. If your in Rome for a shorter time go to the Vatican (even if your not religious), Trev i fountain, Parthenon and surrounding neighborhood. Go out to the Appian Way and the underground catacombs. This attraction will bore most kids (including your 18 year old kid) unless they are super into history."

What remains of the Forum needs interpreting and a little imagination. It also helps if you have some knowledge of Republican and Imperial Rome and the time line so you can place the various ruins in the right period. The Forum was in use for over a thousand years so it is multi layered and far from complete with numerous structures overlaying other partly excavated ones. You also need to appreciate that some of the restoration work is less than perfect so all is not as it seems.This is a live archaeological site with several areas being restored or excavated so you may not get access to the complete area. On my latest visit the Curia was closed.You will also need a good couple of hours to do it justice. If you have any interest in ancient Rome you will find this absolutely fascinating. This site was literally the centre of the known world for what we now call the West and shaped our history for over a thousand years. For that alone it is worth a visit."

At 23 Euros it's not cheap, but the ticket lasts for 7 days or 9 entries, whichever comes first, it includes the Forums, the Coliseum, the Baths etc etc. Well worth it."

This review is not about the whole Forum but rather the newly opened church of Santa Maria Antiqua.This small site, which is tucked next to the Temple of the Vestals and the Temple of the Dioscuri, and nestled against the side of the Palatine Hill, has just undergone a multi-decade renovation and restoration. It contains the 6th-9th century remains of dozens of marvelous, Byzantine style frescos as well as the original encaustic icon of a 'Madonna and Child', the earliest surviving such icon from the western half of the former Roman Empire. There is also a nearby 'Oratory of the 40 Martyrs', and a portion of the original Roman Imperial ramp that led up to the residencies on the Palatine Hill. The surrounding Flavian walls have also been restored, and the chapel given walls and a roof in keeping with the design of the original.With your Colosseum/Forum/Palatine ticket, admission to this site is now free until September 11th, 2016. Since it only opened to the public on March 17th of this year, I assume that soon afterwards a fee of 12 or more euros (as stated on numerous websites) will be charged for admission, and this free admission is a simply way to build up a public buzz about the significance of the art.And marvelous it is, not just in what remains---in some cases, palimpsests of 6th-9th century frescos overlap one another in a puzzle quilt of faces and forms---but in how the state-of-the-art educational, digital light show and music illuminate the history and meaning of the images in the two side chapels. I was honestly so mesmerized, I stayed through two screenings of the 5 minute cycles for each chapel.If you know anything about the history of early Christian art, especially its Byzantine influences, or are curious about the transition from Roman to Christian styles, this site is an absolute must see."

We took a lot of guided tours on our honeymoon but she was the best guide we had. She was very knowledgeable of what she showed us, was patient with the group and set a good pace. Unfortunately, when we toured the Colosseum she had to turn our group over to another guide. This guide was probably quite knowledgeable but we had to use hand-held audio devices which was very awkward and it made it hard to hear the guide. Most people in the group didn't bother with them. Again, if you happen to get Chiara as your guide you're in for a very good tour!"

When going through the Forum you are seeing the heart of the entire Roman empire.Being able to enter temples, to see the handiwork of Rome, see the actual site where Julius Caesar himself was cremated, walking past the statues of the Vestal Virgins, etc., was unbelievable. You actually are wandering through history and you get a bit of a feel for daily life in ancient Rome. Of course, I am interested in history\u2026but my wife, who does not enjoy history was also enthralled. This is a sight not to be missed on a visit to Rome. You will always remember it, as will your family.We paid for a tour through OverRome, and it was expensive, but very much worth it. The guide (Julia) was great \u2013 very friendly, knowledgeable, and kept it interesting for everyone. I did not feel rushed nor overburdened with data...she stuck the wright chord with everyone.We were there in March, and the weather was perfect.One important warning\u2026When you enter the site you have to go through security. The guards insisted that we take off watches, etc. Don\u2019t take off your w watches and small valuables\u2026put them somewhere, but not in the bin for the metal detector. I did, and my watch \u2013 a gift from my wife -disappeared. I was the last of our group to go through, and after thoroughly studying what happened, I had to come to the sad realization that the security people had to be the people who took my watch. This also explained their complete indifference when I mentioned it was missing. I related the incident to others who frequently travel in Italy, and they related that this was not uncommon."

This is where it takes some real imagination (and no small dose of curiosity) to come close to fully understanding and appreciating Rome's ancient ruins for all they once represented. You may be perfectly satisfied by the photo ops here, as they inspire amateur and professional photographers alike. But unlike the mostly-intact Colosseum, the crumbled buildings and lonely pillars of the Roman Forum are in a much more advanced state of disrepair. You have to work harder (think harder) about them to put the pieces back in place. But the Forum is an absolute must for those with an interest in world history and architecture, for it was this once prime real estate that was the center of civilization. A 2-3 hour walking tour is highly recommended, ideally one booked in advance and one that allows you to skip the ticket lines. Would also highly recommend taking along a small book called Rome Reconstructed available throughout Rome. It has detailed color renderings of most all the existing ruins and utilizes a system of transparent overlays with each that allows readers to quickly see what they looked like in their heyday. For 14 euros, we found this book an indispensable aid for our ruin-viewing."

There are inclines and uneven pavement so good walking shoes (for my daughter and I our adidas) are helpful. We visited with a guide and so got a great overview of what the area looked like once upon a time leading up to now. It really is amazing - the history, architecture that survives -- truly awe inspiring. My son, who is a history and mythology buff, really enjoyed seeing the structures he's only heard about til now. Take a peek at the location where Caesar was cremated (people still leave coins and flowers) and be sure to admire the view from above as well as in the midst of the ruins. Terrific photo ops.

The current admission fee to the Forum is \u20ac12, which includes the Forum, Palatine Hill, the Santa Maria Antigua Church, which is open until October 30, 2016, as well as the Colosseum. The ticket is good for 2 consecutive days, but you have to visit the Forum, Santa Maria Antigua Church and Palatine Hill at the same time. You can visit the Colosseum the next day. It is more expedient to purchase your entrance ticket at the Forum. The ticket lines at the Colosseum are very, very long and there is a separate line for those who already have their ticket, which is shorter.The Roman Forum is fascinating. I would suggest renting the audio guide or at least having a very good guidebook and map. Unfortunately, the Senate House has been closed for some time now. I don't know why or when it will reopen.Maria Santa Antigua Church has not been open to the general public for over 30 years. It is located at the foot of the Palatine Hill. It will be open until October 30, 2016. This is a \"must see.\" The church was damaged by an earthquake in 847 A.D. and has recently undergone extensive restoration. There is a very informative audio presentation depicting the history of the church and its renovations. The frescoes are incredible.On Palatine Hill, in addition to the archaeological ruins is a small museum, which is worth visiting. When we were there, the House of Livia, unfortunately was closed. It is always \"hit or miss\" as to what is open and closed. The museum was closed when we were there in January 2016."

I was always standing in the right spot, as they are numbered on a map you are given to accompany the tour, however the cues were a bit lacking. The narrative was otherwise good, and indeed the area, what is left of it, still left a great deal to fuel the imagination. Indeed you can never truly see through your mind's eye what was actually there, however the narration and ruins do help you to piece together some of the missing architecture.

The Forum was the heart of Roman politics and religion, so to come to Rome for a trip to take in the history of Rome without spending time at the Forum would be an unthinkable thing to do. Situated on the Palatine Hill, the Forum's ticket is included with the ticket for the Colosseum nearby, and is valid for 48 hours from purchase. If you buy the Roma Pass, entry will be free provided you make this location one of your first for visiting. If you want to simply take the scenery in at your own pace, simply make your own way around the site in order to take in the sights and read the information panels that are placed around the area. A tour is useful for finding out additional bits of information (for example, which Pope decided to try and claim a part of one of the temples!) that would otherwise be overlooked on information panels. The biggest thing to be aware of however is that this site has limited shade, and limited toilets too. Bring plenty of water if the temperatures are high. If travelling with children, be aware that this area is extremely open, meaning care should be taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. To those who have studied the history of Rome, you will be transported back in time; whilst sitting there it was easy to envisage Romans visiting the site, and honestly quite an amazing thing to behold."

Note: If you plan to go the Colosseum, Roman Forman and Palatine Hills remember three things; i. Roman Forum and Palatine Hills count as one entry if using the Roma Pass, ii. if you get the combo ticket for all three sites it is valid for 2 days, and iii. do not get combo ticket from the Colosseum due to the much longer queue.We started at the Roman Forum and because we had a Roma Pass, did not need to queue (there was a queue of about 50 waiting to get tickets and a family of four in the reserved ticket queue); we went straight through to where the security guard is standing. If you need to purchase tickets, get them from the Palatine entrance, when we were leaving from the Palatine side, people were getting tickets without having to wait. When we went to the Colosseum, even with a Roma Pass we had to queue 30 minutes to get through the queue outside and go through all the security checks. If one does not have the Roma Pass or the combo ticket, the queue at the Colosseum for purchasing tickets was longer."

The Forum is a marvel of engineering where the time has opened up entire basement and building's profile of many stories high allowing the visitors to imagine how living there must have been. The Forum was not only a commercial hub but a political and religious center where many great events and decisions were made. If you walk all the way to the back, you will also discover where the Palace of the Emperor was built and some gardens and mosaiques are still in good condition.

We bought a combination ticket to the colosseum and the forum before we left for Rome and boy are we glad we did! By 10am the queues were astronomical! I would highly recommend to pre purchase the 'skip the line' tickets. Waiting in the queue we passed would certainly sap the fun out of the day. We just had to take our print out receipt straight to the desk.I did find once we were inside that the signage was pretty none existent. If you are interested to learn about the site I would recommend buying a detailed guide book and taking it inside with you. I wish I had done. A must visit in Rome, this was really the highlight of my trip. It truly is like stepping back in time."

Wish we would have bought one. 1/2 day does not do it justice if you want to take in each portion of the city. We were too tired to do a tour group, but I would definitely spend the money next time with a tour or at a minimum audio tour. Its breath taking to know the details!"

My suggestion is to get a tour guide, as it's often difficult to tell what each of the ruins were in Ancient Rome.There are ancient marbles walkways, that you almost imagine Julius Caesar walking on as he strolled through the city. Columns, busts, marble, all shapes and sizes of ruins I. This rectangular area called the Roman Forum.The Main Street is called Via Sacra and runs through the middle of the Forum. The Forum is in the same ticket that you purchase for the Colosseum, so it's a good deal. Wear comfortable walking shoes. Not handicap friendly since the walkway is uneven"

It is a huge site filled with ancient roman ruins that give you a sense of the scale of Ancient Rome. It is perfect for a leisurely walk round on a wonderful sunny day, taking in the history. I think they do audio guides and I would say it would be worth having one as there is not a lot of information around about the Forum.Normally it is about 12 Euro for access to the Forum, ColosseumAnd Palatine Hill, which I think is great value for three sites and you could easily spend a day wondering around them. On the first Sunday of every month these attractions are free, making it even better value. They crowds do not normally start descending on the sites until about 11, so I would recommend getting there early so the sites are quieter.Another tip is that the forum and Palatine Hill shut earlier than the Colosseum. When I visited visitors were stopped from entering the Forum at about 2.15, compared to 6.15 at the Colosseum. So to avoid disappointment I would suggest seeing these two sites first and saving the Colosseum until last.I had a great time here and would recommend it to anyone."

There is ongoing archeological exploration o=in all these areas, so the place keeps changing. From NorthWest to Southeast, you will visit the Fontana della Rea Roma, the palazzo Senatorio, the Tabularium, Carcere mamertino, the Septimus Severus Arch, the Templo di cesare, the Tempio dei Dioscuri, the Antiquarium Forense, the Arco di Costantino, ending at the Colosseum. There are many other important archeological findiongs in this very large area, so plan at least 3-4 hours for your first visit: you will likely return several times, especially if you are a history fan. This large area is open and the Roman sun can be powerful. make sure you wear sunscreen and a hat and carry water or other beverages with you. There are no commercial entities inside the archaeological park, so whatever you need, carry it with you.

Ancient Rome's showpiece centre, a grandiose district of temples, basilicas and vibrant public spaces. The site, which was originally an Etruscan burial ground, was first developed in the 7th century BC, growing over time to become the social, political and commercial hub of the Roman empire. Citizens of ancient Rome referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum.It was for centuries the center of Roman public life: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world.Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archaeological excavations attracting 4.5 million sightseers yearly.Many of the oldest and most important structures of the ancient city were located on or near the Forum. The Roman kingdom's earliest shrines and temples were located on the southeastern edge. These included the ancient former royal residence, the Regia (8th century BC), and the Temple of Vesta (7th century BC), as well as the surrounding complex of the Vestal Virgins."

Beautiful architecture and builds design. You can still see the original old marble in some places. Try going to the hanging garden as well, the view from it is breath taking and amazing.

The Roma Pass allows 3 day travel on transport inclusive of fast track entry to 2 Museums/Historic sites. The Colosseum and Roman Forum count as one site and can be visited over 48 hours. I visited the Colosseum and Forum over the Monday and Tuesday. The Roma Pass counted these two historic sites as one item. The Colosseum can easily take up a couple of hours and more of observation, the forum also can easily take at least 2 to 3 hours and more of observation. Palatine hill within the forum, the area of the Empirical palaces is located within the historic Forum area. The Roman Forum is surounded by the ruins of several Roman government buildings of ancient historic importance. It was the centre of Roman Public life for centuries. The location is between Palatine Hill and Capitoline Hill. Some of the Roman empires earliest shrines and temples were located on or near the Forum. The temple of Vesta and surounding complex of Vestal Virgins. The Shrine of Vulcan, the Republic of Romes formal Comitium, the birth place of the Roman Senate and Republican Government. Many important buildings overtime were constructed around this area. There are 8 granite columns remaining of the temple of Saturn, an important temple that doubled as the state treasury. Behind this temple are the ruins of the temple of Concord, temple of Vespasian and Titus. The Porticus Deorum Consentium (Portico of the Harmonious Gods) located at the bottom of the ancient Roman road that leads up to the Capitol i. Rome and to the Temple of Jupiter at its summit."

The front gate advertised a free app that you can download to help guide you through (we did not know until we got there so did not have it) that I think would have been helpful. We did not do a tour or the audio guide and got though fine.Also, there are water fountains throughout the forum that are really nice to fill water bottles up with! Also! When you buy a ticket for the forum at the gate, it includes entrance to the Colosseum as well. There was almost no line when we went to the forum and entered from the North side. There is an entrance on the East side as well, near the Colosseum but we found the line to be long there when we left.

If the Forum was still enact, it would be on the shortlist of most impressive sites ever.I would recommend getting a guide or doing heavy research before going. We have a friend from Rome who showed us around. Her dad is a history professor so we were in good hands, but without her or a guide we would have been lost. There is just so much to see.This is the birthplace of western civilization and politics. Take the time to spend a couple of hours wandering. There are multiple places to get good shots of Trajan market and the Colosseum. We used are Roma pass to get in. It allowed us to skip lines and we were in within five minutes. Book in advance to avoid lines, especially as it gets hotter. Come with an open mind and prepare to be amazed!"

As you approach the Main Gate to The Forum its not hard to imagine yourself being accompanied by a horde of Wraiths making the same journey as they did in life long ago. The Gate itself seems unaltered by the Centuries and you pass under it in the same manner that the illustrious and the infamous of Rome`s Glorious and Gory Past also did 2000 years ago. There still stands the place from which a Heart-Broken Mark Anthony addressed the Crowd that had gathered by his dear friend the Assassinated Roman Emperor Julius Caesar`s Funeral Pyre. Reduced to Ruins though they be enough still exists of the Buildings to transport one`s imaginative mind back to those All-Powerful,World-Ruling,Days. One Roman friend of ours, Maria, said on our visit last August (2015) that they all live among a lot of Decay. I suppose that`s true to an extent, but its a decay that fires other people`s imaginations when they see it. The Italians must be commended for being the first Nation that applied themselves to preserving the Wonders of Architecture that exist in their Ancient Cities. They deserve the Title of `Care-Takers of Culture` for their efforts to preserve what is not being produced in this modern age. The French have a great Cultural sense and Attitude of Responsibility for the creations of previous Centuries as well.Hence, by those far-thinking efforts of long ago the rest of the World can come and see and also find pleasure and delight for the senses in all that has been carefully restored and maintained."

All of the major sites have queues for both security and entrance, so be prepared to stand around for a bit and travel light as it's no fun repeatedly pulling everything out of your back for an x-ray. They are also somewhat disorganised, which if you are chilled and happy to 'go with the flow' doesn't matter, but if you are a grumpy old sod looking for reasons to gripe, then it's a good excuse to make the rest of your visit utterly miserable for your companions.As with the Palatine Hill and Colosseum, the Forum leaves a lot to be desired in terms of information on what you are actually looking at. There are a few info boards which (thankfully) are written in both Italian and English, but most of the buildings and statues retain a secret anonymity which is frustrating if you are keen to know what the place is all about! Our visit in April was probably one of the best times to go. Once we had calmed down after our unsatisfactory experience with a tour guide at the Colosseum we were able to enjoy the tumbling roses, sweetly scented orange blossom and the sheer enormity of the site whilst we tried to recreate it in our minds' eye without the benefit of the audio tour which we managed to miss picking up on our way in.You'll also find handy little vending machines with snacks and hot/cold drinks hidden away in what would have been Roman shops 800 years ago. They were a welcome pick-me-up after a lot of walking, but as with most other things on the site, are not signposted so it's quite easy to miss them.Now I\u2019m going to say a few words about being a tourist in Rome, and I will include it with reviews of all the places we visited because I wish I had known prior to my visit and maybe it will help you on yours!Firstly, Rome is an elegant city. Tourists in shorts, crop-tops and mini-skirts stand out like a very sore thumb. This attire will mean you are unwelcome in churches, (especially the Vatican and the Vatican Museums) where it is regarded as disrespectful. Expect to be turned away if you are dressed like this. We witnessed from one lady in microshorts and a strappy top and her partner in vest top, Bermudas and tattoos, being politely asked to cover up or leave St Peter\u2019s which did not go down well after waiting for hours in a queue.If you dress smartly you are less likely to be bothered by hawkers, tables materialise in apparently packed restaurants, and you are treated with respect. It\u2019s worth going for \u2018smart casual\u2019 if you want to get the best from Rome.Secondly, footwear. Roman streets are mainly cobbled and very gappy. Stiletto or kitten heels are going to be mighty uncomfortable. Wear block heels, wedges or flat shoes and you won\u2019t go far wrong. Most Roman ladies seem to run around in loafers or boots. Another thing to consider is that there is A LOT of walking involved wherever you go. Walk your shoes in thoroughly before you get there and you will save yourself a lot of pain and blisters. Nevertheless, it might be a good idea to pack some plasters in your handbag so you don\u2019t limp yourself out of action. I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019m the first person to lose a toenail after three days walking around the city.Be polite, smile, say hello, please and thank you in Italian and you will be appreciated as much as you appreciate the Eternal City."

Everywhere you look you see history and when you think of how old this is you get your breath taken away. But the are lacks a lot in planing, there are some signs with long texts. No signs with photos and far between signs with maps so you have no clue where you are or where your going. Its a bit like a big maze. More informations would give better understanding what you are looking at. This was by far not the only place in Rome lacking information signs."

Very little visual guidance to tell you what you're looking at, so I would recommend either a guided tour or a good guide book. Apparently you can also get into the Coliseum much more quickly by going via the Forum first and getting a ticket for both."

Ruins, yet - but still amazing architecture and art scattered almost casually throughout the grounds. Don't miss the site of Caesar's assassination - just a mound of stones in the stone remains - but an important part of history and legend. On the way back to our hotel we walked by Torre di Argentina - another site of Roman ruins, but this one is home to a rescued colony of cats. They can be seen lounging around the fallen relics and columns and basking in the sun on top of large stones. Down a stairway in the far corner, you can visit the Cat Rescue colony between the hours of 12 Noon and 6 PM. And don't forget to return in the evening - see the glow of the lights reflecting and playing over the ruins of Ancient Rome. Beautiful."

Be warned that this path is a dead end, but before you get there, you do get some good views of the forum from the top of some hills on the way round. Another good place to see the majority of the forum for, without charge, is the terrace of the Vittoria Monument that you can see from the forum (the massive white stone building with green chariots and horses on it)."

Whilst we initially planned to cover all three in one day we soon ran out of time! It is worth noting that Palatine Hill and Roman Forum must be seen on the same day as the ticket won't allow two visits on over two days to these two sites. We started the morning thought accessing the Palatine Hill entrance - which is recommended due to the length of queues and we purchased audio guides for all three sites (remember to save ur receipt so u can pick up your audio guide for the colosseum).Whilst it was interesting, I don't think it is absolutely necessary to have an audio guide, there is information available as you walk through.

You can imagine the might of Rome by just seeing the ruins of the buildings that once stood 2000 years ago and also on Palatine Hill was where Romulus founded the city according to legend and where emperor Augustus built his palace. The Colosseum and Roman Forum was my favourite attraction in Rome.

The forum is located across the road from the Colosseum so it\u2019s great to visit The Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill in the same visit. You can purchase a combination ticket for all 3 sites online for 12 euro and it even allows you to skip the lines. We used Rick Steeves\u2019 free audio guide to lead us through the forum. From the Arch of Titus right down the Sacra Via it was an incredible visit. Just walking along the stones where great Roman leaders and statesmen once walked was an unbelievable experience. The forum is quite big and has many sights to see so it is advisable to get an audio-guide or guidebook or something of the sort otherwise you will likely be quite lost. Also, it is completely open so if you are going in the summer make sure to take sunblock, sunhats etc. If you\u2019re going in winter, dress very warm as its just stones and concrete in a shallow valley. Wear really comfortable shoes as the ground is uneven in a lot of places and there is a lot of walking involved. Definitely a sight not to be missed in Rome."

It's nothing compared to Pompeii however. If you don't want to pay the entrance fee or queue for hours then you can see most of it from the roadside on the way to the Colosseum. The best place to view it and get a grasp of its layout is an \"aerial view\":- Go up the hill on the right hand side behind the Victor Emanuel monument (the big white marble edifice in Piazza Venezia) and you have a Birdseye view. One thing to note:- They sell a two day pass which gives you entrance to the Roman forum and the Colosseum but you can only enter each site once. The Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are classed as one site so you can't go to the forum one day and the hill the next"

We used the Rick Steve's guide book and audio guide to make our way through the wonderful Roman Forum. We made the mistake of going out of the Roman Forum for food and had to buy another ticket just to get back in. So I would advise you to buy some food or eat something before you enter the Roman Forum. Do not miss the grave of Caesar, the senate house, the house of the vestal virgins, temple of turn and venus and the spot from where Marc Anthony gave his famous speech. The list is endless...to keep it simple, don't miss anything and take your time to appreciate what remains of the Rome's glorious past.

One ticket covers both of these sites and the Palatine Hill. The most impressive thing about the Forum is the scale of the site, considering that it is in the heart of a modern capital city. You can get a feel of what it must have been like in Ancient Rome.So why is this not a 5-star review? Well firstly, apart from the triumphal arch and the columns, there isn\u2019t much very spectacular to see. The site is impressive for the quantity of surviving stonework rather than the quality. Secondly, even in early March the site was crowded with steady streams of visitors \u2013 in summer it must be murder. To see intact buildings without huge crowds try visiting Ostia Antica instead (or as well).A final point, if you\u2019ve purchased (or are planning to purchase) a Roma Pass. It makes sense to visit the Capitoline Museums followed by the Forum/Palatine Hill/Colosseum on the first day of your pass as this will use your two free museum admissions on relatively expensive museums that are next to each other. You\u2019ll then get reductions in any subsequent (probably less expensive) museums that you visit."

Lovely pub , had an orange juice, though the Guinness beer was tempting. Stopped at the pantheon , walked on towards trevi fountain and finished at the piazza del popolo and then found a lovely vegan restaurant at via margutta"

For me it was way more impressive than the Colosseum, which is a bit of a letdown once you've braved the crowds. The Forum is very busy too with masses of guided tours, but there are so many awe-inspiring sights and fantastic views that you can almost forget the other people. There are a few exhibitions in covered areas, there are also drinking fountains and decent facilities (with toilet seats!!!!) but be warned that there isn't anywhere to eat (well not that I found). The walk up to the Palatine Hill is quite tiring but well worth it again. Allow at least an hour to an hour and a half to see this place."

We visited the Forum as part of a City Wonders tour that also included the Colosseum and the homes of Augustus and Livia on the Palatine Hill. Our guide Ambra was fantastic. She was extraordinarily knowledgeable, accessible to a range of people with varying levels of exposure to the history, and friendly. At its base, it would be a beautiful walk through somewhat jumbled ruins, but if you want to come away with a sense of it importance to Roman civilization, an advance investment of study time, or an investment in a good tour, is important."

Enter by the Hop On-Hop Off bus stop once you've bought a combined Colosseum-Forum ticket from the booth by Septimus Severus Arch.You climb the side of the Palatine and walk the Via Nuovo for views over the Forum. It's not as big as we remembered and there's not all that much there as it's been plundered or built over. Still, it's essential for anyone interested in Romans to make this pilgrimage. Why? Vestiges of the Vestal Virgins, a huge temple to Julius, Mark Antony's speech site and the other monumental arch. The Antonino and Faustina Temple shows you what the Forum must have been like in its heyday.Negatives: the closed entrances and lack of a simple guide like NT and EH supply to their sites."

How do I feel about that? Well I'll be happy and willing to pay the next time I go if I see that the money is actually being used for conservation work on the archeological sites and not just to fill the pockets of the Comune of Rome! Bear in mind: make sure you get the combined ticket which enables you to visit the Forum, Colosseum and the Palatine. (cost at the time of this review: 12 Euros); if you are going during a busy time (school holidays, summer holidays etc) it's probably worth paying the 2 Euros reservation fee for the Colosseum; opening hours vary but they DO hustle people out before the stated closing time (it was unbelievably, at 4:30pm on a beautiful sunny day at the end of February! So they go by season and not sunset!) Look up as well as around you, there's so much to see above your head! Once last thing - a piece of (obvious) advice to the ladies: wear sensible shoes! The Roman roads and all that walking are painful at the end of the day, even with sensible shoes! Enjoy!"

They are located immediately next to the Colosseum and include the remains of several important ancient government buildings. It was expanded up until the time of Constantine and remained the political focus of the Western Roman Empire until its fall two centuries later. Doors from the Curia (Senate) were taken to St. John of Lateran's Basilica where they remain today. Entry into the Forum is included with your ticket to the Colosseum. The Arch of Constantine, Palatine Hill, Roman Forum, and Colosseum are all next to each other and should be visited together. We left locks on Palatine Hill and put the keys in shadow boxes we made for our travels to Rome. Set aside at least 2 hours for the ruins and do a guided listening tour. Upon exiting on the Colosseum side of the Forum, was a sketch artist named Roberto selling custom sketches of the landmarks near the site. My friend and I each bought one for 30 euro each and love them."

The sheer volume of ruins is breathtaking and if you go on a guided tour you get to learn all about the history of the forum. The thought of walking in the same foot steps as Caesar just gives me chills. This is a joint ticket with the coliseum so make the most of it. If you get to visit when the sun is shining it even better."

The political intrigue, Caesar, Brutus, (Yes, I know he wasn't actually assassinated here, but he was cremated here!), etc? Given that, it was a marvelous afternoon strolling first up the Via Sacra and through the Forum. The sheer volume of ruins here is remarkable, and I really enjoyed seeing the ruin's ruins. Meaning, this spot has been used for so long, being built, torn down, and rebuilt that in some places you'll see older ruins under ruins from Caesar's time. Some of these would have been ruins he would have marveled at. Just remarkable. My favorite spot here is an unassuming mound of seemingly rubbish that it what's left of the dais upon which Caesar was cremated. A must visit."

I found the the whole experience to be utterly humbling.The only downside is that, because Rome has so much history, they have been a little careless in maintaining some of it - and some ancient artifacts are placed in highly inappropriate locations, simply because it might look better."

See where the mad emperor Caligula was murdered by his own palace guard.Some of these tidbits were on signage provided by the Italian Archaeological authorities, most were not. Be sure to take along something that helps you grasp the context and interrelationships of what you see. I brought along Rick Steves' walking tour of the forum on my iPad. Made all the difference. TIP: if you bought a Roma card be sure you use it on the Colosseum/Palatine Hill/Forum sights. They are the most expensive attractions on the list and only the first two sites you visit are free.We had planned to continue our tour of the Forum until 8:30, but were surprised at a closure announcement about 4:30. Check their website the day of your visit to see when they actually close. It worked out for us, but just barely.Highly recommended. One of the things you MUST see when in Rome."

Although the weather forecast for our visit was not good this time, we decided to go for it - luckily the forecast was totally wrong, and we had a sunny but cool day, perfect for wandering around this wonderful place. There are various entrances, and we found the one near the Wedding Cake was the best bet. Although a little slow, the queue did finally get us to the reception, where we paid for the Forum audio tour - you can pay a little extra for the Palatine Hill as an extra. The audio tour was easy to use, and it is very informative, as well as easy to collate with the numbers around the Forum. If you have ever had an interest in the Roman Empire, this is the place to be. To see where Julius Caesar was cremated after his assassination, to stand where Cicero gave his orations, and to see where the Vestal Virgins lived was amazing, you could feel the history all around you. We did go up the Palatine Hill, where there are panoramic views across the city, and down to the Colosseum. There are water fountains around the site for refreshing yourself with the famous Roman waters. A fantastic experience which must be done if in Rome."

When we were there graffiti was on some of the structures, the landscaping was a mess, and there was no oversight as people were walking all over buildings and monuments. We were surprised that there was no security or someone trying to preserve this historical area."

We heard about the long lines and how you can spend a lot of time waiting so we booked a Colosseum Tour with Special Access to Underground & Arena Floor through Expedia. The tour was conducted by City Wonders and the whole tour was AWESOME!!! It started with a guided tour of the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill and ended with an incredible tour of the Colosseum. This tour allowed us to bypass all of the lines tied to all three of these sites and our guide gave us a very comprehensive tour of each site and provided us with so much incredible back story to really help our group really understand what we were seeing. The magnitude of the Roman Forum is striking. It encompasses a very large area and while they are ruins, you do get a good feel for just how impressive this area really was back in its day. The guide that accompanied us throughout our tour was awesome and really helped bring it all to life for us. So much better than an average audio tour. The entire tour (Roman Forum/Palatine Hill/Colosseum) was awesome! I'm so glad we paid the extra money for that very unique and enjoyable experience."

When your wandering around the mighty ruins you soon get the gist of how thing were, the remaining buildings give a good visual view of the way the Romans ran their lives. Everything is massive as was their beliefs in gods, the layout gives good indication as to what each building was used for. This was one of the areas where senators and dignitaries lived and worked. The temples are well defined and the temple of vestal virgins is clear to see along with other important structures.

To be fair, we have seen amazing ruins all over the world, and perhaps we have become a bit difficult to impress. If you've never seen ruins, you will probably love it! That said, I do think it's hard to really appreciate all there is to see here without a guide. Had we had the guide we had from the Rome Free Walking Tour, I know we would have had a very different experience."

Standing in the midst of these structures makes you appreciate that people were able to do so much with so little. As with most of the historical sites in Italy, visiting the Roman Forum with a knowledgeable tour guide makes the experience so much more enjoyable."

There were maps and information boards dotted around the site. To really explore this site and see every inch of it, allow a few hours as there is so much to see. It is still worth a shorter visit though as even a brief glimpse of the history thee is impressive. The ground is not even, so is cobbled, some stoney, very muddy puddles in places if it is just after rain so wear appropriate footwear. Ensure you go to Palatine Hill whilst you are there too for fabulous views of the forum."

In summer it is heaving, there are very few bars or cafes around so take your own water and plenty of it. The Palatine is next door with fewer people if you really can not stand crowds. My husband lasted about 40 minutes in the Forum before leaving. However, going to Rome without seeing the Forum is a bit like eating fish and chips with no vinegar!!!! It really has to be done!!"

This was the centre of government buildings and important temples. This was where all the decisions of the future of the Empire were made. This is where Julius Caesar was murdered and Augustus was made Emperor. Really, I could write pages on the historical significance of this location!Located between two of Rome's famous hills, the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, it is now an ancient of ruin but impressive nevertheless. I would recommend that you look at a 3D simulation of what the Forum looked like in its glory before you visit to fully appreciate the grandeur of the buildings. Or if not, make sure you carry a map with you, especially if you continue onto Palatine Hill as it can be easy to lose your way!The views from Palatine are breath-taking so don't miss it and of course you must visit Domus Augustus (Augustus' Villa) - it is by far the largest house there (Of course!) and you really get a feel of Roman living it up!"

It was awesome to walk the same streets where the Romans walked - what history!Note: uneven pavement so watch your footing. Better to wear sneakers than sandals.Very crowded so either go early or late. The middle of the day was jam packed.We followed the Rick Steves audio guide and had his book with us also. The audio guide was great however it was hard to follow which site was next. It would be best to look at the Forum map ahead of time to see where all the sites are ahead of time to follow the audio tour.Taking our time to walk slow, listen to the audio guide, read the book and taking lots of pictures took us around 2 hours so budget enough time to see it.They had announcements in various languages warning about pickpockets so things must be bad so be aware and watch out. That was the only place in Rome where we heard this announcement.If you like my review, I hope you'll click the 'helpful' button; those of us who write reviews live for those and it motivates us to do more."

You might be advised to take water and/or a picnic with you, to wear comfy shoes, and to go with plenty of time. There are two entrances - one down past the bus stops (in view of the triumphal arch) and one down the street from the colosseum (towards capitaline hill and across from the ruins of the imperial forum -which has no entry fee). Having a guide - audio, live, or a book is *VERY* helpful here. Without it, it's a bunch of ruins. With guidance, it comes alive and tells a magnificent story. FYI: The going is a bit rough, though, and would be hard (or impossible) for wheelchairs, walking impairments, and strollers. Take your time - if you rush through this site, you'll feel like you ran a marathon due to the uneven walkways and hilly area it sits on. We did the colosseum and the forum on the same day and were beat by the end. But oh, was it worth it!"

Several tour companies that give tours of the Colosseum include the Roman Form and Palatine Hill for free as part of a 3 part tour so if you are going for the first time, it's smart to book one tour and pay one price for all three. And it's definitely better to have a guide your first time, as you will learn a lot more history about the ruins. I would not recommend this tour for small kids unless they are really into history. Make sure you pick a day where it isn't going to be sweltering outside, as there isn't much shade. However, if you do go on a hot day, there are free water fountains all throughout the city in Rome and there is one on Palatine Hill with cold, good drinking water to refill your bottle if needed."

You need to wear comfortable walking shoes, as the pavement is uneven and rough in spots. Also, the Forum is not a great place for young children or toddlers.

The site involves a lot of walking with steps in a number of places, so if you are bringing a wheelchair or a buggy plan your route and allow extra time. However there is a route at the top of the site which still allows you to view a large section of the ruins, without having to navigate some of the trickier parts.

I suppose that is one way to view it, but another is to remember that these are ancient ruins--and to my mind completely astonishing because of that fact. In the first place I was completely unprepared for the number of the ruins--not only in the area of the Forum, but elsewhere in Rome. Secondly, it was very interesting that these buildings had been reclaimed in the middle ages to become churches. What I found was a fascinating mix of history and purpose--religious sites mingled with a \"shopping complex\" and public square. And while it may be difficult to determine what this specific formation or that is--at least without further study--it does not detract at all from the wonder that all this is still here for those of use in the 21st century to enjoy. I encourage everyone to visit and simply take in the essence of it--which is actually one of the only places which I don't find the crowds to be distracting."

A few years ago the Temple of Romulus (no, not that Romulus) became accessible, and this year the sensation is the opening of the ramp connecting the Forum with the imperial palaces on the Palatine above, complete with a small exhibition. A byproduct is that now you can also see the Oratory of the 40 Martyrs (Medieval wall paintings) and the little sanctuary of Giuturna next door.

Follow the advice of those saying get your tickets in advance or save 2 euro and get your ticket for Palatine Hill, Roman Forum and Colosseum here or PH! No line and I saved 2 euro. Also, get a guide or the audio tour. There were lots of things I missed I'm sure simply because I had no idea what I was looking at. That being said, there is still so much stuff to see here. Even though it is just ruins, it is the ruins of ancient Rome and that is crazy to me. Stuff in the United States that is \"old\" is only hundreds of years old if that so all these temples, statues and remains are great to see and learn about. Be careful and bring sensible walking shoes. Bring a water bottle and fill it up at the fountains in the area. Water is completely fine to drink and you don't have to pay for it!"

The Forum and Palatine are beautiful, immense archeological sites with magical beauty and a unique place in the history of Europe. Yet, the site is badly managed, with very few signs and explanations and no map. Many dead-end paths that suddenly end on an empty wall. If you don't come prepared, with printed maps and a good guidebook, it is better for you to see the site from the street. There are vending machines (incl. coffee) and restrooms on site. There are also some elevators but they might not function properly. The Palatine Hill, away from the Forum, contains many lesser known archeological sites, like a giant hippodrome. You can really keep wandering and discovering things for yourself. Not many tourists go that far."

My fianc\u00e9 and I tried to rent the audio tour headset, but they were out of English audio, so we ended up downloading a free podcast by Rick Steves. It's one of his walking tours that takes you through the Roman Forum and directs you to the sites in a certain order. We didn't get to listen to the audio provided by the Forum, so I can't say this is better, but I'm guessing that it is because I've never had a great audio tour provided by a site. The podcast we downloaded was informative with lots of cool facts and humor and was an easy, fun listen that was about 50 minutes long. Just search Rick Steves Roman Forum.The Roman Forum closes early, so make sure you leave yourself plenty of time. The line in the morning was super long-- we attempted to go then, but opted to wait and had some wine at a nearby bar and then lunch at another restaurant nearby-- and that was the right decision. When we went back at 1:30pm the line was short and we waited about 10 minutes. But be aware that they stop selling tickets at 2:00pm and that you must exit the entire property by 4:30pm. 1.5 to 2 hours is plenty of time to view the Forum and soak it all in.The history of this site is fascinating, so don't miss it!"

This way, you won't have to wait for the crazy queue at the Colosseum when you'll go there, and you'll be more incentivized to visit the Palatine/Forum which have to be on your Roman agenda.Walking in the middle of the ruins, aged 2000 years is just so special. it is packed with history and I recommend going there with a good touristic guide explaining the different ruins/monuments, as otherwise you may not enjoy it as much.It is a quite big area, and for some reason it is less packed than the Palatine Hill or the Colosseum, which I enjoyed a lot!"

The changes that I witnessed on this visit were monumental and made the cost of admission worth it. The fact that workers were active while tourists were wandering around in awe taking pictures was an indication of how important this grande restoration project is to the Italian people.The Forum is just one of the many must see sights in Rome and throughout Italy whether for the first time or fifth and one you just cannot miss."

Clearly it was changed and added to over the centuries and then left to decline, so you have a mass of half-standing ruins, piles of columns and other bits of stone work and so on. As with the Colosseum (see separate review) it would be good to find more information on site regarding the history and what you are actually looking at but it is a fabulous place to amble or sit in the sun and just wonder at. If you are lucky, you may see some of the famous cats living in the ruins. Most people walk through from the Colosseum end parallel with the Vai dei Forii Imperiali, using it as something of a thoroughfare, but if you have time, be sure to cover the whole site, as the far end is under-visited and has a view down onto the Circus Maximus, site of chariot racing and other sporting events in its day."

Even our teenage children were enthralled by the cobblestoned streets and the ruins of the temples and buildings, some of which were turned into churches. We were especially thrilled by the massive columns and steep steps on the temple of Antonius and Faustina; the domed temple of Romulus, with its gloriously painted ceiling (and the view of the church through the window at the top); the little, easily missable door in one of the buildings that supposedly led down to the underworld; and most of all the Arch of Titus, built in the first century, which depicts the Romans conquering and plundering ancient Jerusalem, and carrying off the golden candelabrum. A little knowledge of Roman history and mythology helps make what you're seeing in the Forum clearer, but you don't need to be an expert, and there are signs on the main sites."

While I expect it may be a little too 'well manicured' and small in size for some, for me it was a perfectly-sized time capsule and the remaining architecture and surrounding views was simply charming. Makes you wonder about the level of skill it took in that time to construct the amount of intricacies still to behold. The forum does not cover so large an area that you feel like you might miss out, and it leaves enough time to explore the remaining attractions in the area comfortably."

The Roman Forum is at the base of Palatine Hill and is a plaza surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings and temples and was originally used as a marketplace. Also the Roman Senate met here. There are some restored buildings along with the ruins of many others. From this area we saw the start of the Appian Way which is the oldest and most important roads, built in 312 BC. Its purpose was to move troops and supplies in and out of Rome quickly and easily. The road began as a leveled dirt road upon which small stones and mortar were laid. Gravel was laid upon this, which was finally topped with tight fitting, interlocking stones to provide a flat surface. The road was raised in the middle (for water runoff) and had ditches on either side of the road which were protected by retaining walls. Upon the defeat of Spartacus' army, in 71 BC, 6,000 slaves were crucified along the 200-kilometer (120 mi) Via Appia from Rome to Capua. The Appian Way was also used by the Allies during WWII in 1943; and it also served as a part of the men's marathon course in the 1960 Olympics."

They use lights, lasers and \"magic\" (i have no idea how they did some of it) to re-create everything as it was 2000 years ago. It really brought it to life."

It is very difficult to put into words the magnificence of the site. With a little imagination you can reconstruct the buildings in your minds eye and be on the bustling streets of ancient Rome. There are information placards by every monument (see pictures) but to do the site justice I would recommend a little research of the site. Look out for Caesars tomb. There are renovations on going at the site and it would appear the site will be extended in the future. As I say a little knowlage of the buildings would enhance the experience, but in my opinion the future of ancient Roman history is very safe in modern Roman hands.

However I wouldn't recommend it unless your on a limited time scale, theres alot of walking and crowds involved and I don't think you'd appreciate it all. We did the colosseum one day the roman forum the next. We brought the audio guide, it had two options the 1 hour or 2/3 hour tour. We chose the 2/3 and regretted it, there were around 60 points to stop and listen and each one was about 5 minutes long. Unless your very into your history you don't need the extensive overview that it gave.I suggest using the map and maybe find a free pod cast with an interesting narrative and wondering through the suggested route. There was some very impressive ruins and when you reach the higher points you could get a really good view of what old Rome was really like. All in all we spent a good 4/5 hours there, it can be done in less."

The best view is probably from inside the Palatine on the far hill so you can really imagine what the Forum once looked like but going down to explore the many temples and read some of the history is worth it.

There was a lot of excavation going on and significant portions of the forum were closed, roped off and strictly off limits to us, which was incredibly frustrating to have come so far only to be stymied like that. However, we had a tour of the upper area which was informative and fun, and it was still remarkable to be in the presence of this place. Hoping the next time we go, we will be afforded more access. Looking forward to it. (Lots and lots of walking - this city is truly comprised of hills and inconvenient steps. Bring a walking stick if you have limited mobility, and an inhaler if you have asthma. Also, to hell with fashion and wear what doesn't make your feet feel like they're trapped in a pair of iron maidens. That's good advice, right there.)"

My husband and I bought them at a TI near our hotel. The first two attractions where you use it, it actually serves as your ticket. We were able to walk right by the line to buy tickets and straight up to the entrance - no waiting! We had the Rick Steves Rome book and used that to tour the ruins and understand what we were looking at. If you get the Roma Pass, be sure to visit the Forum and Colosseum on the same day because they count as just one use against the Pass."

We set a day side to wander round here and we are glad we did - it is not somewhere you go for a quick look around!We initially entered from the Colosseum end which turned out to be a mistake. We wandered up this path (uphill) to to top, before it was clear that we could not get in that way and had to go all the way back and further up the road towards Circo Massiomo in order to get in. When you get inside, it is better sign posted. Considering the buildings are open to the elements, they are really well preserved and you can get a relaly good picture of what they may have been like 200 years ago. This is a great place to just wander around and let your imagination run wild! I am not sure that I would return her, as I don't think I would see or learn anything new, but it was an enjoyable day and I would thoroughly reccommend it. We went on a fairly warm day and there were lots of drinking fountains around which was good."

He asked a passing visitor to take the photo which transpired to be about 7 when finished he asked for 20e as a payment. Thought this out of order as I wouldn't have the photos taken you should have been told at the beginning.

I have always been very keen on Ancient history so visit at Forum Romanum was extremely interesting for me and moving as well. You can see there the very beginning of the Roman Empire. The most interesting attractions for me were Regia (the seat of first Roman kings), the temple of Vesta and the house of the Vestales, Lapis Niger, where Romulus, the founder of Rome, died, and the altar where the body of Ceasar were buried. Also, there is a very mysterious place named Umbilicus Urbis which was believed to be the centre of the world and the point where real and spiritual worlds were connecting. What is more the ground of the lowest part of Forum Romanum is at the same level as it was in Ancient times. I recommend going to Forum Romanum from Colosseum, down Via Sacra. That is the way that processions in the Ancient Rome used and you can really feel the history there. Colosseum and Forum Romanum is free on the first Sunday of every month. Other days the fee is 12 euro (in 2015)."

In ancient times it was the center of public life and today is a world class, historical tourist attraction. Most of the important ancient buildings were located on or near the Forum. It is located in a small valley between Capital and Palatine Hills and is also located a couple of blocks west of the Colosseum (a very short walk).I visited this amazing historical site with my wife and daughter on a Monday morning in mid-March and REALLY enjoyed it. Arriving in the morning worked out well since it was not very crowded. I had visited this place several years ago but did not have enough time to really appreciate it. We hired a tour guide who seemed to know everything about this area and pointed out every important ruin. Without his help it would have been a little confusing since most of the structures were only partially standing. I highly recommend that you tour this area with an experienced guide.We bought a combination ticket for about 12 Euros which allowed us to visit the Colosseum, Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum. It was easier purchasing the ticket in the morning at the Palatine Hill location since there was no line at all. Make sure you keep track of your ticket as you will need to show it a second time when you get to the Colosseum (I just jammed it into my pocket and thought I had lost it).Overall I really enjoyed touring this ancient, famous historical site and highly recommend it. This is an absolute must see attraction when you are visiting Rome. Rome is amazing as there are several absolute, must see attractions within a short walking distance of each other."

Get here in the morning and find out what time the last lot of people are allowed into the Colosseum in the evening.2. Walk on ahead... check out the Palatine Hill and Roman Forum in the morning.Colosseum is the most popular structure and you see it as soon as you get off the metro, so everyone rushes in there and it's a crazy rush. You can see it from the hill...Carry water to the Forum and Hill... especially in summer! This will easily take 2 hours and you're gonna be hungry at the end of it.3. Post lunch, if you got the energy you can probably check out the Piazza Venezia which is right behind the Foro Romano. You can do something else and return here in the evening 45 mins before for the time when the last batch was to be let in into Colosseum.- You have avoided crowds...- You catch the sunset from the Colosseum... (It's awesome!)"

And the climb up Palatine Hill for the views is worth it. Incredible history."

It's boring to look at it without listening to stories. Several objects have descriptions, but there are only bare facts and they are also boring.There is really stupid system of selling audio-guides: they don't sell it to you if you come from the entrance near Colosseum, but they have another entrance not far from the Monument of the Republic where you can take one. And if you entered at the Colosseum entrance you cannot go out to take guide, you will have to pay again. It's very stupid. The audio-guide costs only 5 euro. The ticket costs 12. Also take some water or at least a bottle. There are several places where you can get water to drink inside the forums. Otherwise there are a lot of guys who sells 0.5l bottles for 1 euro. Also you will probably need a hat and sun protection for your skin.The photos will be great anyway It's a great place, but I was disappointed because I could not get an audio-guide."

On the other hand there are big maps that are helping to find out what is what.At the cash-desk you can borrow a mobile phone, on which you can listen to a plenty of information about the each sight.

See my separate review.It is amazing in some ways what has survived and in other ways, what has not survived. The cremation site of Julius Caeser, the site of the famous Roman Senate and government. You have to use your imagination but it is possible to imagine all of the old buildings.Coming from California, the concept of OLD is somewhere in the beginning of the 1700's because there really, except some heiroglyphs, isn't anything that is older than that other than Sequoia trees. Seeing what the level of civilization that existed in Rome in 0 BC/AD was is pretty amazing. I think this site is best experienced with a guide who can explain the site, the history and what has been done to bring it to its current state.Definitely worth seeing."

My wife and I (both retired educators) recently returned from 3 weeks in Portugal, Italy, and London. A highlight of the trip was our visit to the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palentine Hill in Rome. Our private guide was Carla Zaia. Her knowledge of that area is phenomenal, surpassed only by her passion for imparting that knowledge to her clients. She was totally focused on sharing this part of her city with us for 3 hours. We felt like a beloved member of our family was guiding us and teaching us about Ancient Rome. Visitors should know it is a WALKING tour, and that one is walking most of the 3 hours. There are some inclines and some steps, but it is very doable. Carla did an outstanding job of answering all our questions and helping us to understand the culture, the achievements, as well as the shortcomings of Ancient Rome. I would recommend this area as well as Carla for the tour. You can buy a combo ticket for all three attractions--Colosseum, Forum, Palentine Hill--and can do the tour on your own (without a guide). However we felt our guide enhanced our understanding of the area and was most deserving of both the fee as well as the gratuity we added."

I love ancient history so I love to just investigate the area and the many attractions. We prefer to visit the Palatine Hill first (do the gentle climb first and then go down to the Forum) and if you pay for tickets there then you can get one that includes the Coliseum. This will last for 2 days and it will save queuing up at the Coliseum to enter the next day. It is about 12 euros each for all 3 areas - a bargain. In the Summer it can be very hot, but we have discovered that in October the temperatures are great for site seeing. The site also had plenty of toilets and areas to buy refreshments. In August it can be hard work if you don't like hot weather - walking around in 40 degree heat is hard work but well worth it.At night the area is all lit up and has that magical quality that only places steeped in history like this have. There is a new attraction which projects images on to the walls of one of the forum areas. It is 15 euros to sit and watch the audio, but we enjoyed it with just the visuals for free.Not far from the forum is the monument of Victor Emmanual and there is a lift which takes you to the top for the most amazing views of Rome on both sides.There are also lots of good places to eat nearby and the chance to sit and look out on to this amazing area, glass in hand and marvel at the wonder that was Rome at the height of its power. Enjoy"

In these days of space limitation and 'overcrowded building programmes' it was good to see that Rome has concentrated on making its heritage 'open to view' .

A good tip is to buy your ticket at the entrance to the palatine forum... they allow the day of purchase and one extra day to get round the two attractions...one day is more than adequate... and if you purchase in the afternoon before 3.30 pm there aren't the queues to worry about."

The place is quite vast, well organized with sign boards carrying information- hence its easy to navigate.

We really enjoyed the site and especially my kids aged 8 & 10 which was surprising as we didn't have a guide and we only had a guide book and it can be hard to picture how the ruins looked. The area of the Vestal Virgins was in a lovely space and was easy to see how the buildings would have looked. The view of the forum is excellent from Palatine Hill and I would probably do the Forum first and then go to Palatine hill so you can get some context as to what you are seeing. We did the Forum and Palatine Hill a few days after the newly opened connecting tunnel but would have loved to see it linking both areas together. Quick tip- the two day pass for the Colosseum, Palatine Hill and the Forum is to be used as one day for Palatine and the Forum together, you can't seem them on separate days like we did but the lovely staff let us in anyway."

The site gets very busy with loads of escorted tour groups so getting around can be a little tricky. The difficulty with this site is that it's both Roman, Middle Age, and much more recent so unlike Ephesus for example you're walking through 2 millennia of ruins. But that's history! Site descriptions are in English and Italian and we didn't bother with an audio headset or tour guide. You can learn a lot online.

It was the centre of intellectual debate, public legal pleadings and executions, business was conducted here and it was the centre of Rome's religion with the houses of the Pontifex Maximus, that of the Vestal Virgins and a major concentration of temples to the Romans' gods and godesses.The Roman Senate met on the Capitoline Hill overlooking the Forum, Cicero and other famous orators spoke from its Rostrum. Condemned traitors were hurled from its Tarpeian Rock.

This forum is huge in comparison to the other forums in Rome and houses many interesting ruins such as the Curia, which is where the Roman Senate conducted \"business\". There are two triumphant arches on either side of the forum with beautiful carvings contained within, Romulus is said to be buried within this forum but we could not locate the spot. Also, Caesar's ashes are buried here in a tiny building that you can enter! There are many other wonderful sites to see here, but for me, the ones that I love the most besides the ones that I just mentioned were the Temple of Antoninus & Faustina and the Temple of Romulus (not dedicated to the original Romulus--Founder of Rome) because they appear almost whole in comparison to some of the rest of the buildings, Casa de Vestalli (atrium and home of the Vestal Virgins) and the Temple of Vesta, which is my favorite of all! :)"

Unlike the Colosseum which is so huge that it can only be used as photo background, there are many interesting things that you can use in your photos. I suggest that we need to to some reading about the Forum and get to know what it was like thousands of years ago. A lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes. Only one drinking water fountain near the east entrance, can be very crowded especially in hot sunny days. No place to buy water or food. Around 11 am large tourist groups began pouring in, and the place became noisy and less attractive. Terribly long queues out of every entrance."

It is an amazing area to walk around and imagine that these people with whom I felt so familiar, such as Gaius Marius, Sulla and Aurelia Cotta, had at some point had tread the same paths, strolled or paced between the same walls. Even now, with all the tourists, it can be incredibly peaceful up on the hill.

Colosseum and Forum tickets are sold together for a very reasonable 14 euros (with booking fee) and you can use the ticket over 2 days, so book your ticket online, see Colosseum first and head to the Forum. Mind you, Roman Forum is Massive! It'll take at least 2-3 hours to go around without a break so plan your trip accordingly. There are vending machine located here and there or better yet bring you pack lunch and enjoy it while taking a break and taking in the views. We climbed up straight to the Palatine Hill (first left after you enter) first and saw Circus Maximus...etc. before going down to the forum. I'd recommend arriving early -we did Colosseum at 8:30 and Forum from 11am- as it gets busy as the day goes by. It is a fascinating view from the hill and well worth having a break there."

It's worth going to as the ticket is included in the price of the Colosseum ticket. If you love history - it's very intriguing to see how the buildings have evolved over the years & there are some almost entirely intact temples, but the rest is in varying states of ruins. If, like us you become a little ambiguous, We treated it like a walk in the park, wandering round between buildings for a little while and moving on to wander the grand ruins at the Palatine hill. In total for both sites was around 1.5hours - but it could take much longer if you read everything in detail."

With hindsight, we probably should have downloaded a guide onto our iphones before visiting.I'd also recommend bringing a bottle of water, as there does no't appear to be anywhere on site selling them.Even without the guide though, there is sufficient written information to make the visit informative and enjoyable.

The other issue is that most of the areas are blocked off from actually being able to get near them even though they had been more accessible in the past.

The best time to go start the palatine is mid afternoon, where you can stroll round, enter the roman forum directly after and get to the colloseum for about five o'clock in the evening. You will not have to queue for your ticket as you would have already bought it. The roman forum itself is a wonderful place and there is a lot to see.

I guess it's always been a small world. These places are surprisingly preserved, but I'd recommend hitting Google ahead of time if you don't recall this history, or doing a little research before you go. It will make it all that much more interesting if you know what you're looking it. Wear comfortable shoes, the walkway is ancient stone. You'll want to bring a bottle of water in. If they sell any inside I didn't see it. There is one restroom and the line is a long one. Like all these ancient sites, convenience isn't there, but it's worth the small hassles to see it.(I went twice, and one day was in the rain.

The Roman Forum is a large sprawling expanse of land that was once the center of Rome, a gathering place for people, market place, religious buildings and civic center. this must have been a spectacular sight back then. Today it is an open area with ruins, columns and pieces of buildings scattered throughout. Since there is all open, there is no protection from the weather. In August it was very warm and sunny. Hats are recommended, and a bottle of water. The Forum can be reached from Piazza Venezia and the Coloseum. Incredibly you can walk thru and amongst all these ruins. The hop on hop off bus will not leave you in a strategic position to reach it easily. A must on your trip to Rome."

Luckily they're spread out over the Forum itself and the Palatine Hill, which is part of the same site, with your ticket including both, so you're not shoulder-to-shoulder all the time.I am a history buff, and had done a lot of reading on Ancient Rome before we went. But even so, there is a limit to how much time you can spend on one site like this! I took the audio guide, and after an hour and a half I had only visited a small part of it, not even half of the Forum itself. Take the time to explore how the audio guide works, and pick and choose what you're interested in. There is a map on the screen showing all the numbers on the tour, plus you can see pictures of things, click on them and hear about them.Seeing things like the Rostrum, the Arch of Severus, and the Temple of the Vestal Virgins was amazing. But the more you know about it before you go, the better you'll be able to decide which parts of this massive site you want to spend time on.I found the Palatine to be of much less historical interest, but it has a great view of the Forum from the top.Your ticket to the Forum and the Palatine includes the Colosseum. Buy your ticket at the Forum (no line-up when I was there) and go there first, and you won't have to line up to buy a ticket to the Colosseum."

Instead we used the rather limited information given by a few signs. I think this is one of the few places in Rome where a guided tour in worth spending the extra money on.It turned out that the ticket was valid for two days. However having just gone through the exit we were informed that you were only allowed to enter once per site (Forum and Colosseum). So we did not see that much of the Palatino hill as we had just excited for a cup of coffee."

The small areas of grass were most interesting seeing butterflies, dragon flies, bees and small lizards. The fact that the structures had lasted so long and survived earth quakes was impressive. The cost was OK, we had paid in advance as part of a deal and used the time before entering the timed slot for the Colossuem to browse around. There were some signs up describing the exhibits.

I have always been fascinated by Ancient Rome - studying Latin for 5 years certainly helped - so I was always going to love a trip to the Forum. We went on Sunday when it's free entry. I had no need of a tour guide as I had my trusty Forum book with overlays of all the ruins showing how they looked in their hey day. My kids like me are fascinated by history and mythology so we just explored every nook and cranny we could get to and read about everyone of them if I didn't already have a story to tell from my Latin class days. Don't rush this place. Sit, look around and just imagine what is was like 2000 years ago. Move to the next sit and do it all over again. Wear comfortable sturdy footwear as there is a lot of uneven ground to explore but make sure you do just that - explore. And do it at your own pace. While tours can give you a lot of info, they rush you through and you can miss the time to stop and let what this place is really sink in. Get a souvenir book - Rome Then and Now was my go to 35 years ago and I found a new copy at a bookshop at the Vatican that I used on this trip. It took us around the forum at our own pace."

Be prepared for a lot of walking and as this place can take a day on its own to see it all I would advise taking some lunch with you as there is no where to buy any. There are drinking fountains which provide fresh water so take your botlle and fill up. We walked for hours so a comfy pair of shoes is a must! A little tip is that the ticket for this place cover the Colosseum as well but it is a once entry for each location.If you like history this is the place to go, well worth a visit."

Very primitive pillar, some broken grounds, total lack of guide, so visitors look at the ruin they don't even understand what is what. In the illustration book, the Roman forum is amazing, yet in reality, only 5-10% they can preserve.Anyway, a plus point is that if you don't want to queue in a long line to buy ticket at Colosseum, you can buy the ticket here (valid in all sites).

But credit has to be given where credit is due - and this is one such case. It is made a little easier here as this is not a modern facility which is being assessed but something inherited from way back when.When one things of the limited facilities and tools they had \"way back when\" (apart from an unlimited supply of slaves) the Forum is even more remarkable. The structures (even where they haven't quite managed to stand the test of time\" are amazing and the stories that were trotted out by our excellent guide brought the place to life.I can't agree that it is better to take a tour through the place on your own - I felt that we experienced far more listening to someone who had obviously spent a lot of time learning the history than struggling through on our own (a guide's license is an essential - so check on this). Our experience was made all the better by being in a small group of 11 so we really got \"individual\" attention.Bear in mind though, that the place is busy (very) especially on a Sunday when the Sistine Chapel is closed and tourists head toward the Forum and Collosseum. But once inside the crowds thin out, especially up the hill towards the palace.Don't miss either this or the Collosseum - although as a tourist those 2 are probably top of your list anyway!"

Be creative, there is more to see for free than you might expect. Take the Via di San Petre in Carcere at the NW side of the Forum to get magnificient views over the site.Also look at the opposite side of the Via dei Fori Imperiali, where other remains are definitely worth a short visit."

We had a guidebook and used that to read about the sights we were seeing and imagine filling in the blanks. I think a guided tour might also have been good option. Going with no information would probably be boring, since there aren't many signs.

The best and easiest (shortest lines) for entry were near the Arch of Titus, which celebrates his conquering of Judea. As we walked down, we pass the Basillica of Constantine, (at least remains of it!) which when complete was truley immense. Its importance lies in the fact that future Christian cathedrals were based on its design. Other key sites included a visit to Caesar's Temple, where he is buried according to legend, It is the place of Marc Anthony's famous funeral oration. The Temple of Antonius Pius (2nd century) was later taken over (as were many other temples) as a church. The Curia (Senate) building is also quite breathtaking, located near the Arch of Septimus (2nd century).Don't miss the chance to walk up from the Forum to Palatine Hill, with a wonderful view of the entire Forum complex, with the Coloseum in view as well."

There is very little shade in the Forum, so I would definitely recommend wearing a hat. We stayed for 3 hours and still didn't manage to see everything. We only made it halfway up the Palatine Hill. I would recommend getting to the Forum quite early if you want to see everything, including the Palatine Hill.

If you buy a ticket to go to the Colosseum (which you should), an entrance to Foro Romano is included and it's actually right by the Colosseum. Make sure you have enough time to walk around since it takes at least 2-3 hours, but it's worth it! Foro Romano was the main center of the ancient Rome and you can find ruins of many important buildings there. It has a certain feel to it - since it's thousands of years in the history of the excavations. Don't miss it when you're in Rome!"

Tours can get in the way of proper viewing so going to the top of the hill and looking down on the site early in your tour gives a good perspective if you can identify the different buildings below that are then worthy of a closer look at ground/street level."

There are some labels but bring a book showing a map of the area and pictures of what the building use to look like and their function. Doing this would make your time more worthwhile, and an incredible experience. Bring water, your camera, proper walking shoes as the surface is very uneven, and ensure you have several hours.

Though we moved quickly, we saw a lot. Our guide seemed to be very interested in getting to her next gig with some of the members of our group, so rushed us through. Later, with a different guide, we did an evening tour with Walks of Italy. It was after hours, so we viewed the ruins from the vantage points behind the Capitoline Hill and walking down the pathway to the Colosseum. This tour was combined with a night tour of the Colosseum and well worth the effort. If you pay to enter the Colosseum during the day, the Roman Forum is included in your ticket. Our night tour did not enter the Forum."

This is a very large area and has many ruins....RUINS. Hence you will many times not know what you are looking at. My suggestion, you need a guide. Do not get the audioguide offered at the entrance; it plainly sucks....horribly. If you don't want or can't afford a real guide (they are everywhere, just track one down and ask how much), then a close second option is to download Rick Steve's audioguide tour of the Roman Forum onto your cell phone. It really is a great tour and you will walk away from the Forum with a better understanding."

The Forum was the original downtown of Rome, and we spent at least 4 hours meandering around the ruins, and trying to absorb that over 2000 years ago, this was a thriving area and the heart of ancient Rome. My wife and I really grasped the significance of the site after buying a neat inexpensive book (8-10 Euros) that shows the ruins, and the pop-up shows the actual srtucture as it was originally built.

The military dominance the Emperors that led it through history and the pictures of the grand buildings with amazing columns at the entry way and inside. All the pictures that those books displayed and articles that we read are nothing in comparison of experiencing it. Walking through the ruins and seeing the layout of how the buildings were constructed and the history that is described as to what materials were used in a given time period and the statues that are still in place in the garden with two ponds. We went in August which was the hottest time on the year so if you go make sure you bring water with you. There are fountains for filling bottles but there may be a long line to get to one. Allow yourself time to be able to read the signs to get a feel of the meaning of each site. There is an elevator at the entrance but I did not see one on the grounds and there are stairs and hills. Make sure to wear shoes that have support on uneven ground and are comfortable. You will walk the same streets that the empire was built on and Julius Caesar walked on. The columns are enormous and even after all the years that have passed several are are still standing. Being able to not only read the history but also feel it and experience it was to us a once in a lifetime trip. You never get to experience it for the first time again."

The tour is subcontracted to another operator. We were issued with radio receivers and headphones but had to change a couple of times to get ones that worked. Our guide gave us a brief overview and we set off to the Colosseum. Thank goodness for the skip the line tickets because the lines waiting to get in were enormous. Our guide was good giving a good incite to the building as we walked around the second level. There were plenty of opportunities to ask questions and take photos. From the Colosseum we went across the road to Ancient Rome again great to get in quick with skip the line tickets. Overall we enjoyed the tour and found the lady guide (Sorry but I forget her name, maybe Francesca) interesting and informative. I would recommend this company with the proviso they sort out their radio problems. Top tips: bring your water, EUR0.5 from supermarket \u2013 EUR2.50 from hawker stalls near Colosseum. Keep your empty bottle as several public water taps on tour route to refill bottle free!"

Surprisingly, for late July, it wasn't overly busy and we really enjoyed our visit."

I booked this as a tour with the hill and the Colosseum through City Wonders FKA Dark Rome. This will definitely be more enjoyable with a tour guide. A romantic journey through time for a couple of history buffs, it won't likely impress many modern couples/families with no interest in the past.

From the northern end of Via dei Foro Imperiali, theres a side road leading to the Capitolini museum. The side road forks out to one going down to a dead end but gives a flavor of what old Roman roads are like and through the barricades one can have many views of the Foro. Back tracking to the fork then walk the other road up to Captiolini hill to see a pano view of the Foro. If you have a good zoom lens, you can reach views further afield. However, if you intend to visit the Colosseo then buy the ticket at the Palatine Hill entrance, which got no line, then go in and visit both Palatine, Foro and then cross over to a special entrance to skip the line at the Collosseo.

It is also worth considering that excellent views of the forums are available free of charge just by walking along Via Dei Fori Imperiali or for the best view climb the steps up to Piazza Del Campidoglio."

It's less busy than the Coliseum, and offers a real look into how the ancient city was laid out.The best thing about visiting the Forum is that you are truly able to take a trip back in time and walk among the ruins of ancient Rome. Start along the southwest side by the Coliseum and the Arch of Constantine and enter the Forum through the Arch of Titus. You can follow the paths around to visit ruins of temples, marketplaces, basilicas, monuments. White marble, rust red bricks... the variety of stones are still there and they create a beautiful scene before you.There are enough presentations around for your own self-guided tour. And if you want to take part in a guided tour, just open your ears... guides are talking all around you in many languages."

It was a very hot day and we went to the Palatine Hill first and then the Forum. Having finished Palatine Hill I was so tired I didn't have the strength to walk through the Forum. There's no shade however it is a short walk to Capitoline Hill which is on the other side. There are great views of the Forum from the top of the hill. The Forum was home to politics, religious, shops and markets back in the day. It has survived a fire and an invasion but as it's all ruins now you'll need a really good imagination and some knowledge of the history to appreciate it. My husband was more fascinated than me."

This is a fascinating place to visit. When I saw all the massive ruins, I can\u2019t imagine how prosperous Rome was. At that time they didn\u2019t have the equipment like we have today. How can they build such gigantic temples and arches?? How did they set up all the Marble columns?? If you do a little research and have a map on hand, you will know the temples and arches and let your imagination bring you back in time.Happy travelling!"

In the good old days, this was the center of public life. Given the status of the Roman Empire, this could be seen as the center of the world. Now all I saw was ruins, not impressive one at that. I cannot recall any particularly memorable site. Agora, its counterpart in Athens, looks like a garden and features a museum. The forum is purely an open-air museum, providing no shade in the July sun, but food for thought. I did not spend much time there, partly because I was tired, and mainly because no much was there. I exited the place through a door to the Capitoline Hill."

But you are really left to figure that out all by yourself (or I guess, go with a massive tour which is not something I enjoy). If you are used to sites that come with signage you will be sadly disappointed. Throughout it is truly a guessing game, sometimes you get a sign for what you are looking at. Every once in a while you get a sign pointing you in the direction of something. There are very rare maps (one of these was located in a fenced off area, so you couldn't even approach it, it would have been nice for them to move the map if they had to close an area down for safety).So basically, you end up wandering around with little information about what you're looking at and little idea how to get to the other parts of the site. I am certain we missed things we planned on seeing and it's hard to say whether it's because they were blocked off due to safety/archeological work or whether we just couldn't find them.Things that would have improved the experience immensely:1. A labeled map given to you when you enter.2. Signs throughout the site directing you which way to walk to see which things.3. Frequent signage directing you to restrooms and exit4. Signs telling you which parts are dead ends so you don't wander down a path to be met with a fence or wall.5. Any place whatsoever to recover from intense heat - I swear if they sold water in this place and had an air-conditioned information center they could make a killing. 6. Nicer restrooms - for those from the US - don't expect toilet seats, potable water, air-conditioning or clean floors.7. Benches to sit onPositives: The line was short, the ticket can be used at the colosseum allowing you to avoid the colosseum's massive line."

(Note to fellow EU-citizens: make sure to bring your passport which will grant you a discount of about 4\u20ac).Buying the ticket was fairly easy. After the purchase we went on to the Forum. (Be prepared: in case you are exploring with backpacks or big purses prepare for a quick security check before entering the Forum. I would recommend putting everything away so you don't have a mess upon security because right after that you'll be asked to show your ticket - lots going on, huh?)My boyfriend and I decided to rent an audio guide for 7\u20ac a person. The administration of the Forum seems rather unorganized as we had to buy the audio guide far off from the entrance we took (close to the Colosseum). We honestly regretted getting the audio guide because the guy talking was really boring; I eventually stopped listening to him. The only good aspect of the guide was the map that would show you locations of water fountains, bathrooms and exits.Also, every monument is tagged with a number and the order of these numbers wasn't in order, whatsoever.All in all, the Forum itself is outstandingly awesome - a must on your list for your trip to Rome! The monuments are even cooler to look at in person than on the web. Although it looks like climbing Mount Everest you should do the Palatine from where you get a great view of Rome, and you can even see the Saint Peter's Cathedral (see pictures I took). I'll also give you a couple of tips for the Forum:- If you're an EU-citizen bring your passport (as said)- Inform yourself about other possible discounts. At every ticket office you can find a sheet with all available discounts listed- In summer: Depending on the amount of people you travel with, let's say you travel in a group of 4, bring 4 bottles and an extra one on top. The lines for the fountains are usually pretty long. - Speaking of water: stay hydrated!! If you don't you'll feel a fish out of water- Don't wear flip flops or sandals - the Forum is DUSTY- During summer: Bring sun screen. Make sure your kids (if brought) use SPF 50 or higher. If not, you and your kids will be fried - not kidding.- My partner and I figured this out: once you start sweating, it is NOT going to stop. After a couple minutes you'll look like a waterfall (that's why you should stay hydrated). What we did was finding shade and sit down or stand around for 15 minutes to cool off, drink water and wait until we stopped sweating"

We walked slightly further down the road to come across a back entrance (walk down Via Di S. Gregorio - past the gated arch monument near the Coliseum) with a significantly smaller queue, we only queued for 5mins and then we were into the attraction. Well worth a look around and not too badly priced for the 2 day pass (\u20ac24)"

There are really buildings left of the Forum -- the building materials were cannibalized for centuries to create other edifices throughout Rome. But walking from the Capitoline Museum (and visiting Marcus Aurelius and Constantine there) down to the Colosseum and then finally to the Column of Trajan\u2026 that walk, through several arches and hundreds of columns, can give you an idea of what Roman civic and religious life was. You will need to know what the columns mean\u2026 the explanations on site are not generous enough. But there are guides easily available that explain what was here & what it means. Get an online guide or a book - there is so much to see and learn here."

Many of the ruins/building do not have signs; what signs they have often jump into boring details of architecture and excavation instead of telling how the item was relevant in the Roman world; and places are often blocked for renovation/construction. Despite these challenges the Forum is amazing. Our Western world has largely been defined by the events and decisions made it. It is incredible to see what has lasted for 2000 years and to lament what was lost."

To me it felt like being thrown back in history, and although I knew little about the buildings I saw, it left me with a stronger understanding of ancient roman society. One warning though: it can get EXTREMELY hot during the middle of the day, more so than the rest of the city, and there are little options for walking in the shadow. If I were to go another time I'd go earlier in the morning! Thankfully there are a lot of places where you can refill your bottle!"

            "review": "A hodge-pudge of History - Some Suggestions. The Colosseum is most often combined with a trip through the Roman Forum and the imperial sites on Palatine Hill, overlooking the Circus Maximus. The Roman Forum spans the entire gamut of Roman History, from the 7th century BC to the 6th century AD (and beyond if you consider the conversions of several of these classical sites into Churches. No guided tour can give you a 'full tour' of the Roman Forum, no matter how talented the guide, since tours are constrained by time and other practicalities. So which do you see and in what order? Well, here are my humble suggestions. First, enter the area and descend. When you get to the bottom, turn around and look at the church with very tall columns slightly to your right. This is the Temple of Faustina and Antoninus Pius (probably Rome's best emperor, second century AD) - now a church. Then turn back around and look slightly to your right at the collection of rocks near you. This is the remains of the Temple of Julius Caesar. Turn to your right and walk down the road (the Via Sacra) to the arch in the distance. This is the Arch of Septimius Severus (early third century). He was born in what is now Libya, was a famous general-emperor, and was the first emperor to enter the city during a triumph in military uniform (an insult to the Senate). That act took place under this very arch. As you face the arch, turn to your 3- o'clock to face the brick building-church. This is the Curia, or Senate Chamber, and Julius Caesar was assassinated in this building or on the steps. Turn around behind you and face the stone platform. This is the Rostrum, or speaking platform. Many famous speeches were given from here, and Shakespeare had Marc Antony give his. rabble rousing speech from here. Next, turn back and face the Arch again. Walk round it keeping it to your left, and stair straight ahead. You will be facing the Mamertine Prison, where Peter was held before being taken to the Circus of Nero in the Vatican to be crucified at emperor Nero's order. Now turn around and return to your original entry place at the bottom of the entrance ramp, facing in the opposite direction. Turn a quarter turn to your right. Straight ahead, you will face several columns in a circular arc. These are the remains of the circular temple of Vesta, their house is just next door slightly to your left. Thirst are the circular remains of the Temple of Vesta. Now turn a quarter turn back to the left. This road, by the way, is the Via Sacra, down which defeated kings and generals were paraded in shame before the people and Senate of Rome. As you walk up this road, you will pass the Temple/Mausoleum of Romulus, son of the emperor Maxentius (great pagan rival of 'Christian' Constantine. The doors here are the original bronze doors from 309! Keep walking and there will be the remains of a huge basilica - that of Constantine and Maxentius (4th century). Continue up, curving round to the right. About halfway up the slope, there will be an Arch, that of the emperor Titus ( a rival for best emperor, and conqueror of Judaea and Jerusalem). On this arch you can see at head-height on one side (North) the triumphal chariot carrying a toga-clad Titus down the Via Sacra. On the south side panel you can see Romans carrying the booty from the Temple in Jerusalem, including the branched candlestick Menorah. Continuing up the slope, you rise to the top of the Palatine Hill. These are my suggestions of things to see in the Roman Forum. There is also an entirely different forum, that of Emperor Trajan, across the street to the north of this older Roman Forum. There are several interesting sites in that Imperial Forum as well. Enjoy!"

If at all possible, try to arrange to spend time also at the Colosseum and on the Palatine Hill. Please, also, see my notes about the Colosseum and the Palatine Hill. What we are left with are the ruins. We do not see the bright colors of the painted walls, the movement of people from one point to another for political, social, and religious reasons. So, you need to try to imagine what it might have been like to watch Roman heroes parade through the arches bringing with them the spoils of their conquests.And, you can also see how the natural valley of the forum was filled in with rubble as the centuries passed. This allowed the building of the church that sits immediately next to the entrance of the forum. This is a common practice that we see in many cities where the center of the town is in a desirable location and the people rebuild over time."

We could do this at our own pace.When you are up at Palatine Hill, there are many great spots to look down into the Forum and great views of Rome.

Our guide Loredana was excellent, our group was small ( under 15) and with our special earphones we could always hear her clearly even amid the throngs of tourists.She made it fascinating.....

We spent about 3 hours at the Colosseum on the first day and about 7 hours next day at the Forum/Palatinate so Eur 12 entry ticket was well worth it. I pre-booked to avoid queues and I would say that was better than the extremely long queues I bypassed. There is not a lot of shade at the Forum, so that can be problem in very hot weather (37C when I was there) but there are little oases under trees here and there and also lots of water taps to refill bottles!

The roman forum is a large public square located in the centre of ancient rome which contained numerous buildings of significance. It\u2019s located adjacent to the colosseum and palatine hill and is covered by the same ticket. Understandably, over 2000+ years the buildings have degraded significantly and many of them were plundered for building goods \u2013 so what remains is a somewhat confusing and incomplete residue of history. You really need some sort of guide to make sense of it all. I would recommend downloading the FREE \u2018Rick Steves Europe\u2019 guide on your smartdevice (iphone, ipad) and bringing earphones. It has a map to guide you with various descriptions of what each structure is \u2013 so that you can get the most out of your experience. I would also recommend getting orientated by viewing the forum from the viewing platform of palatine hill \u2013 you can get a superb shot of the colosseum from this vantage spot also. A sensible and common approach is to have an \u2018ancient rome\u2019 day and combine a visit to the roman forum with palatine hill and the colosseum. Although there is certainly enough time in the day to do this, it\u2019s convenient (they are located adjacent to each other and covered in the one ticket) you need to pace yourself \u2013 as it\u2019s a lot to take in. I would suggest doing the colosseum and palatine hill in the morning and having a long lunch in the shade before seeing the forum in the afternoon (as it\u2019s the least crowded). Bring plenty of water, sunscreen and a hat \u2013 as it gets hot! Takes about 1.5-2.5 hours (depending on the person)."

Lots of scattered and propped up ruins with scaffolding all over the show, but cool nonetheless. We are totally not into history but when in Rome ....Well, we decided to stay in Tivolli and just to trip in on the train for the day. Good choice. We saw Rome. We experienced Rome. You have to do it. One tip: everyone kept telling us to go queue at the Colosseum for tickets. I had read that there are no queues at the Forum and this was absolutely true. Loooong queues at the Colosseum and we walked around till we saw the little ticket office and off we went. This ticket served us well at the Colosseum skipping the ticket sales and just queuing to enter. Thank you to everyone for tipping us on that in their online reviews. It was the most crowds we encountered in Italy, but very enjoyable and a definite must do!"

The forum and palatine are accessed in one visit and I don't believe that multiple entries are possible (on the same ticket). This is frustrating because it is such a large area and there is so much to see it would be better to split into more than one visit. This is especially the case because the facilities inside are quite poor, for example there is nowhere to buy food. Therefore be prepared to take provisions for however long you intend to spend there, and I would say that you need at least 3 hours. I would also recommend that you take your own maps and guides as nothing is properly explained inside. I cannot see this being a suitable place to come with children."

It is amazing how visitors can get right on these ancient sites, saw a couple standing on top of monuments no respect shown, They should have more security to prevent people from doing things like that."

The forum is massive and you can easily spend all day there. But because we were with a tour we only got to spend an hour or so there, so we could only appreciate the highlights. The joint ticket for the colosseum and forum is valid for 48 hours but since we visited both attractions on the same day we weren't able to return to the forum to see the rest of it.

Many advice bloggers suggest to purchase your tickets either from the entrance of the Forum or Palatine Hill because lines are much shorter. Well, everyone know knows this advice and these lines are no longer shorter.I really think that the Forum is not a MUST SEE landmark unless you are into the history and architecture of ancient Rome. There was no WOW FACTOR in this area at all. A couple of pictures here and there, but that was it. TIPS:-There are several restrooms in the Forum as well as drinking fountains.-You can move from the Roman Forum to Palatine Hill. There is no special gate.-The backpack issue was hit and miss.

But whereas the Colosseum was about public spectacle, the Forum was about political spectacle.The whole imagery from Shakespeare: Julius Caesar and \"Et tu, Brutus!\" come to mind. All apparently played out on the steps of the Forum.There are a number of very well preserved Roman buildings here, and many ongoing archeological discoveries being made all the time. When I first came here as a teenager, the Forum itself was a large rectangular building with little less around other than the triumphal arch. However, while that building is still there (obviously, I may not be in my forties but if it's already lasted 2000 years!!!) there are a lot of new discoveries and the Forum is now placed as being one of these new findings.It's a great place with so much history. It's what you think of when you picture Rome.A lot of it is also wheelchair accessible. The Italians have done a good job in making it so, but clearly not everywhere in a place like this can be accessible. Just be prepared to have to push the chairs up some steep inclines!"

I really recommend a tour, unless you're a total history buff, so you know what you're looking at."

I did this review for the Colosseum, but also wanted to share it here:There is not much I can add to this incredible piece of history than what is already out there. However, I am writing this review to give tips to travelers going there for the first time. YOU DO NOT NEED TO BOOK A SKIP THE LINE TOUR if you follow these tips.Tips:1. DO NOT START AT THE COLOSSEUM. It's by far the longest lines and there is not point on standing in line when you dont have too. Instead, go in thru the Palatine Hill entrance. If you are taking the metro in, do not get off at the Colosseum exit. Instead go to the Circo Massimo and exit there. Then walk up the Via d. San Greggorio and you will see the entrance on the left. We had a two minute wait while the Colosseum entrance had a 1 hour wait. The same ticket, which cost 12 Euros (and its free for 18 and under), gets you into Palatine Hill and the Roman forum (which are attached) and the Colosseum (separate). To go into the colosseum, all you have to do is get on the \"have ticket line\" which is the same the tour companies use for their \"skip the line\" tours.2. It is going to take you 4-6 hours to see all three places, so get plenty of water and eat if you have kids with you. You cannot buy drinks or food once inside. Rome is hot, and this place is huge and hilly, so be ready for a good workout.3. Watch out for pickpockets. A lady tried to pick pocket my brother.4. Take the time. This is really an amazing place. Schedule plenty of time to really see it all."

The Roman Forum is part of a larger area of Temples and Roman Empire age relics and ruins. It is easy to miss as you walk around so make sure you either have a good map or use a guide. Like all the ruins it is a place you have to imagine, but this is the Forum where history was made and you are walking along the same pathways. It is an amazing place, but I would recommend knowing at least something of the history before you go. If you aren't a history buff then at least do a quick internet search. You will find lots of hints about beating the ticket queues, like which gate to use and to go early, all of which is good advice. I would add that it can get very hot on a sunny day, so wear a good hat and take water. And also allow heaps of time to wander around, you aren't likely to go again, unless you really love your history so take the time to look around well. It is a place where you get out what you take in with you... it is either another bunch of ruins or it is the amazing place of legend and history which has had such an impact on our modern life. Few places in this era are as significant as the Roman Forum."

Amazing to see the details of the construction of these structures that have stood for centuries. It's well worth spending all morning and into the afternoon in the area, knowing that it will be getting pretty hot as the day goes on. We came back the next day to see the Palatine Hill. The Palatine Hill and Circus Maximus was a long morning walking tour as well.Important note, the 3 site, two day pass that gives you entry (one time each) to Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill is a great value. Important note though, the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill are considered the same entry. We got lucky that our second day was a Sunday, and these sites were free to entry. Otherwise we would have been required to buy another one day pass to go back in the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill entrance for a second time."

She combined her knowledge with pictures of what the ruins would have looked like when they were first built - it really gave a very good understanding of what life was like at that time. We only paid and joined this tour 10 minutes before it commenced from outside the tourist Office near the Colosseum but it was a good decision - we certainly don't think we would have got so much out of the visit without Renata's knowledge of the site's history."

So many photo ops here -- the arches, the pillars, my goodness a trip to Rome wouldn't be complete without a stop here.

The ruins have small placards in both Italian and English, with audio guides and plenty of \"experts\" willing to assist you as well. The offer of a \"skip the line\" is usually the catchphrase. If you wish to be guided, it can be worth it. Do your research and pick a reputable company. If you are going it on your own, I strongly recommend listening to Rick Steves' the night before, or to buy a guide book.An effective way to quickly get tickets and get inside to the Forum, Palatine Hill and the Colosseum, is to enter from a little known side entry opposite the Via Cavour where it runs into Via dei Fori Imperiali. It is a very small ticket office with a gate next to it. The queue was only 10 people on a Saturday where the main entrance had hundreds. For \u20ac12 you get access to all three for two days. You can only enter once per attraction, but can split over two days if needed.You will be walking and walking. Rough stone, stairs, mixed terrain and if after May, in hot humid conditions. Good shoes, sun screen, hat, water, etc. are highly encouraged. If you aren't comfortable, the sights won't matter, as the experience will be diminished. Palatine Hill does offer a cool breeze and some cover under the evergreens. You can also refill your water bottles from the many fountains along the trails.After either being overwhelmed by the history and sites, or, as my daughter put it, \"seeing a lot of bricks,\" exit toward Via dei Fori Imperiali and use your ticket to skip the line and enter the Colosseum.

Be sure to go up to the higher areas and take some great photos and also view it without the camera to make some mental images. The view of the surroundings are unforgettable.

It's just across a park from it and from the Arc of Constantine so you can spend hours in the place, its awesome.

I had done some reading in a Rick Steves Guide beforehand, which I'd also brought along - so I knew what some of the main points of interest were. However, I also had my toddler strapped to me and that interfered a little with the reading along. There was a lot here, more than I could take in! This place is best savored. There is a wide range of history here; it is the site of what used to be the main marketplace/city center of Ancient Rome and so there is this hodgepodge of various ruins and building remains spanning hundreds of years that were from temples, monuments, dwelling places and the old senate. However, if you don't know what you are looking at, it will just seem like some columns and building facades. So, take your time to study it, read along and really appreciate it. There are things that I didn't notice at the time that I wish I'd paid more attention to!Also, make sure to bring water bottles - there is very little shade, and it's a fairly big place. There are lots of fountains but they aren't very easy to drink directly from.Pace yourself and make sure to also visit Palatine Hill, which is included in the ticket price. In my view, the Colosseum is worth visiting but the bulk of your time should be spent here and Palatine Hill."

OVERVIEWThe basic history outline of the Forum is that it was designed by Vitruvius to be the commercial, governmental, religious and social center of Rome. Many of the now wholly or partially dismantled buildings were built in the period around 200 AD; for example the Arch of Septimius. The main sights of the Forum include the Arch of Titus, the Temple of Saturn, Temple of Vesta, and the church of San Luca e Martina. These were all linked by the Sacra Via, the main road through the Forum.You can get the basic historical sketch by Googling and I am not going to ramble on further about this in this review.BIG TIP: My mission in this review is to convince you of the necessity of finding a good tour company to point out the various ruins and the significance of them. Trying to do this on your own would be exceptionally difficult and time consuming. We tried doing it solo in 2000 and came away with only a smattering of information. This year we did a tour and efficiently learned at least the highlights. It would take several visits to fully appreciate these ruins."

The reason is that without an expert, you will miss out on the importance of the Roman forum. In particular, you're expert will be able to show you what was in the forum, how the forum was arranged and how it was run. Without this, you maybe forgiven for thinking that this is just a collection of Roman pillars and arches.My tip is don't embarrass yourself by bestowing the \"ides of March\" in a loud voice. Julius Caesar's body was cremated here, he was actually killed close to Largo di Torre Argentina"

We didn't have to queue, one of the advantages of having a Roma pass. We didn't have to pay to visit this or the Colosseum. It was a very hot day and there isn't much shade so we didn't spend as long there as we would have liked but I found it very atmospheric and the site is bigger than I imagined it to be. Of course there is some preservation work going on, if you were that old you might need some help as well.

It is a very large area to cover and not convenient for those with mobility issues (using canes, balance issues, or in wheelchairs) since you are walking on road and walkways make from stones. Be aware yourself so you don't trip! Make sure you have a hat and sunscreen as it gets extremely hot due to lack of shade.Now I'm not a fan of tours (I don't like being in big groups) so other than an audio guide for a small fee why not take a book with you that gives you the information you will need while viewing the ruins. You could spend hours in this place and not see everything. Plan on a couple hours. There are water fountains and washrooms available throughout the Forum. I don't recall a cafe anywhere so bring snacks or even a lunch. Entrance: there are two that I'm aware of (near the Arc of Constantine); the second is directly across from Via Cavour (crossroad is Via dei Fiori Imperiali). Go to the Roman Forum before the Colosseo and purchase your ticket for both places. This duel ticket is good for two days (back to back) so if your tired after visiting the Forum you can go the next day to Colosseo and walk right in! No need to wait in a line! Enjoy!"

I traveled to Rome alone and spent two days roaming the city and this was my second favorite part (next to the Vatican). There were a number of reasons this is a must visit in Rome. First and foremost...no lines!!! I went to see if I could get into the Colosseum (right across the street) and the line would have resulted in a 1.5 hour wait. I snapped my pictures and headed over to the Roman Forum instead which I walked right in to. Another great aspect of the Forum is that it's free! No fee for your regular admission, which I recommend because Wikipedia can tell you anything an audio guide can.Beyond the convenience and low cost aspects of this attraction, comes the actual value of making the stop. I am not one to try and save when on vacation, especially not when in Europe, but this place is a must see and just so happens to provide that luxury as well. It is a beautiful area, mostly outside, with gorgeous vegetation and architecture. Floral gardens, grand trees, and dense greens weave their way throughout the ancient ruins and hidden structures. It surprised me some of what I was looking at considering we were in the middle of the city still. This, along with some great views of the skyline and some larger structures make for great photo opportunities. I also got to nerd out a bit on the history that I learned walking around. There are a multitude of little fact cards corresponding with every building, statue, piece of infrastructure and fountain. These provide a great short summary of the history behind what you are looking at, and easily identify them as well so you can do further research on your own when you are not on vacation. Simply snap a shot of what you find interesting and the information card for future reference. There are some great large structures that provide more of a wow factor and hold great importance, in addition to all the interesting little nooks and rooms as well. Finally, they have a free museum on site that holds many incredible artifacts and provides some more detailed information about the Forum.Definitely visit here and do so, if possible, on the nicest day that you have. You will be walking outside a lot and for a few hours. They have public running, clean fresh water for drinking (something I am normally against but ran out of my bottle quickly so I conceded and am still here). It can get a little hot and tiring so just be patient, move slowly, and make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy as much of it as possible!"

I took thousands of photos while there and it seems like I am just seeing some of these places for the first time. The Roman Forum covers a very large area and we only spent about an hour there. I need to go back now to take additional photos plus the next time I am coming up with an easy identification system so I will know where I have been. For the traveler please allow me to provide a couple of tips. You cannot possibly see and absorb all if this area in a short time so make you plans for ample time to see at least part of the sights. Visiting Rome is I think one of the most fascinating experience."

There are some well preserved columns and temples, but there are mostly remnants of foundations.I used a Rick Steves audioguide, but got disoriented at times. When I got to the end of the tour, i realized I had missed the Temple of JC. I had to run back and catch a glimpse and photo of the temple dedicated to the first Shakespeare story I read in high school.If pressed for time, you should definitely tour the Colosseum and save some time and energy for the Forum.

If you are a history fan, you can spend over 5 hours here easily, others might wish to leave after about 2, the only con about this place is that it;s huge. My mother can't walk these distances easily anymore, and it wasn't easy for her, please take that into consideration when planning your visit.Even though, this is a must-see attraction in Rome, you might want to buy a combined ticket for the Forum and the Colosseum and do them both at the same day, preferably with a good lunch break in-between."

So, try to separate your visit in two parts, with one day fully dedicated to say Palatine Hill and Colosseum and the other would be reserved for Capitoline Hill and the associated museums. This way you may avoid a sensory shock, a visual overburden and a vast array of historical facts all jumbled together. Another reason for doing so is that the walk down Via Sacra may get pretty tiring because of the rough cobblestones, uneven levels and the resulting continuous climbing. Which brings us to another advice importance of which can't be overestimated: good walking shoes or sneakers is a must! The Roman Forum is a multilayered area, both in terms of history and architecture, with some of the monuments combining in themselves historical periods distant over 1,800 years of each other. So, to fully appreciate and experience your sightseeing tour, you shall either do your homework prior to your trip or equip yourself with a good guidebook featuring digital or pictorial reconstructions of the scattered ruins in front of you, many of which merely look like a few solitary stones. Only by doing that one can feel virtually submerged into this religious, political, administrative and commercial hub of the ancient city.Highly recommended."

It's difficult to describe what it's like to wander through these ancient ruins, marveling that they still exist, and struggling to image what the area looked like during the power and glory days of Imperial Rome. We hired a private professional tour guide for our group of 4 (I can't recommend this more!). We learned so much about the history of Rome, while walking in a place we'd dreamed of visiting for many years. 2 previous visits were either compromised by extreme heat or an unexpected strike, so we were very excited to make it through the grounds this time instead of walking the perimeter."

            "review": "Roman Forum - an easy must-see for first time visitors to Rome. The Roman Forum is an important collection of building ruins from ancient Rome. This area was the most important centre of social, political and commercial activity for many centuries and hosted great buildings of the ancient world, making it one of the most important archeological sights in the world. In the past, you could visit the Roman Forum for free, however, now you must purchase an entry ticket, which includes access to the Colosseum and Palatine Hill (\u20ac12 per person + \u20ac2 if reservations made online). Unfortunately, the grand buildings of ancient Rome have long been reduced to rubble and mostly cleared away. As such, we are left to stroll down the ancient Via Sacra road and wander the grounds of the Roman Forum, imagining what it must have been like to visit this place during the height of the Roman Empire. It must have been spectacular compared to the outside world. Tip: To get the most of your visit to the Roman Forum, it is advisable to purchase a good guidebook and to spend some time going over the various ancient temples, basilicas, palace houses and monuments that are to be seen before you arrive. This will help prepare you for what to look for when wandering the Forum grounds. Tip: You may wish to visit Palatine Hill first before entering the Roman Forum grounds. If you do this, you can walk up to a viewing area, overlooking the Roman Forum and see the entire Forum from east to west, prior to making your visit. This is can be helpful as well for preparing you for the various ancient buildings and ruins you will see there. Tip: The grounds around the Roman Forum can be uneven. Do bare this in mind when thinking about footwear. Tennis or hiking shoes are most suitable for exploring the grounds. Tip: We recommend visiting the Colosseum first in order to clear the queue you are very likely to encounter there when purchasing tickets. Unlike the Colosseum, you won't find the same problem with queues at the Roman Forum. Crowds may be an issue though. Overall, the Roman Forum is a marvel of the ancient world and wonderful place to visit. While much less remains that we would like, it is wonderful that we can still see what is here today. In this regard, this is an easy Must-See attraction for first-time visitors to Rome and a place that many repeat visitors will eagerly wish to return to."

She told me it was best to plan them ahead of time. Whatever, I wasn't in the mood to argue. We kind of wandered near tour groups in English while acting like gawking for the spots we were really interested in. I definitely plan on going back, getting an actual tour, and also spending an entire day so I can get the Colosseum experience as well, since the tickets cover the Forum, Palace, and Colosseum in one go. There's just so much to see and read, it's impossible to do in less than a week, and I only had a half day (due to flight cancellations and such) in my backpacking adventure. So take it from me, definitely carve out plenty of time to see these ruins and take it in! They're amazing and I wish I had a full guided tour, but I'm still pleased with what I got."

It turned out the big long queue was for security so the benefit of a fast track ticket is totally out weighed by having to join an hour long security queue anyway. They have four ticket booths and only two security stands so double the number of people joining than they were able to take - insane!

Admission is free.Most sites are signposted in Italian and French, with brief but good information. Was delighted at having seen the supposed dwelling place of the founder of Rome: Romulus. Palatine Hill offers beautiful panoramic views of the Roman Forum and the Colosseum. The Forum is connected to the hill and you just continue walking around the grounds. You'll need to exit the forum to cross the road to reach the Colosseum. Allow at least 4 hours to see everything, whilst walking at an average pace. 90% of footpaths are cobbled stones, so appropriate footwear is advised. There are no shops nearby, so I recommend carrying a bottle of water."

It was just 3 of us in these large, fascinating rooms, and when I asked how long they had been opened I was told \"three days.\" So, we were among the very first to visit.As it happened, we had earlier been to the Museo Nazionale Romane where they have on display the frescos and mosaics from this very site, so while the walls of the excavated rooms had only faint paint left, in the museum you could see the vivid colors and intricate, lovely designs.

Some of the ruins are just remaining\u2019s of the building's structure or pieces of walls while others are huge pieces of walls with columns and stairs.In order to be able to visit the place you need either a ticket or the Roma pass. The good news is that there is a combination of the Colosseum and the Roman Forums so you either buy a single ticket for both attractions or you use a single free entry in your pass for both of them.The Roman Forum can partially be seen from the outside and you can take photos as well. However, the place is much bigger than it can be seen from the outside and I was surprised by that while visiting it. It represents quite a walk to go through all the sites and walkways. It is an amazing experience and worthwhile as you get to see buildings from a long ago time.Not all the structures are so well preserved, as I was saying, and the destination they had is unclear, some of the signs saying probably when explaining what it stood for, but they are still amazing nevertheless, considering the age and architectonical style.It is quite a walk and I advice you to have comfortable shoes, a few snacks and a bottle of water with you. I didn't see any bathrooms inside, but I think there is one at the Colosseum entry and another one at the middle exit.When you fist take the left alley, it seems that there is little to be seen there but then a lot of structures appear one after the another so you may want to consider that before spending too much time at each, taking photos and reading all the story written in there so you keep enough energy to visit all the area.This visit reminded me of the ancient city Ephesus in Turkey. Maybe this is a little bigger than that one, I'm not really sure and I had a guide in there. I think a guide would have made the difference in here too with some stories related to some of the structures."

We did not and regretted it (especially after overhearing part of another tour).The Coliseum and Forum are combined on one ticket. Purchase entrance to one and you have 2 days to visit the other free of charge. I would recommend doing the Coliseum first, as that takes roughly an hour. The Forum takes much longer and should be saved for last.This would be a great place to take a picnic lunch.Tips: The ticket lineup for the Coliseum is insanely long. If you didn't book a Coliseum tour, or pre-purchase a Coliseum ticket or Roma pass, then a quicker option would be to purchase a ticket at the Forum (a much shorter line) but do not enter the Forum. Take that ticket to the Coliseum and do that first, then proceed to the Forum (or come back the next day for the Forum). Since it's the same ticket, you just saved yourself at least a half hour lineup, and possibly up to 2 hours."

It definitely gives a feeling of what ancient Rome was like and brings the stories to life. I loved it. Probably my favourite activity in Rome.Go early to avoid queues but, once inside, there's plenty of space even on a busy day. There's a lot of walking on uneven surfaces so wear comfortable shoes. Probably worth reading up a bit on the history beforehand as there is almost zero signage or explanation. Also, if I can be practical, there are very few loos."

Like the rest of the Roman Forum, it has long been reduced to ruinous conditions but makes for an interesting attraction to see and learn about when visiting the Forum. During its time, the temple was constructed of ancient Greek design and architecture, being round in shape and lined by 20 Corinthian style columns. The purpose of the temple was the worship of the Virgin goddess Vesta, a popular Roman religious deity during ancient times. Today, what is left of the Temple of Vesta is a small fraction of one of the circular wall sections as well as few standing columns. Behind the standing section, you can see the foundation of the old temple as well. To find the Temple of Vesta, just look at a map of the Roman Forum. It is located near the House of Vestal Virgins. Its standing wall fragment is recognisable amongst mostly levelled buildings in the area. Tip: You might wish to research a bit on this and other attractions, which you will see in the Roman Forum prior to visiting. This will help provide context to what you will see once you are walking around the Forum grounds."

Great advice! We got to the Forum early (about 8:30) and waited about 10 minutes to buy tickets - and this was on a long weekend! There is heaps to see here, so you'll probably need at least 1 1/2 hours. We found, however, that there wasn't a great deal of information on offer for those wanting to do a self-guided tour. A few signs scattered about the place gave you some information about the ruins, but after having a guide at the Colosseum later that day, we felt that perhaps we should have also gone with a guide whilst at the Forum. In saying that, if you are happy just to have a walk around, see some great historical sites and take photos, then you can quite easily do a self-guided tour, but if you are wanting to gain a better understanding of Roman life and history, and having someone tie everything together, then perhaps consider having a guide."

These places had life and much death and as such respect should be shown. As far as ruins go....these are some of the best I've seen. A must see for interested parties pleasant views and great to imagine life 2000 years ago."

But I didn't really like it! It was hotter than hell in there (no wind, no shade), and, perhaps even worse than the conditions, was the signage... it barely existed (or I didn't find it! Could be!). And if it did, it didn't say much. There was no drawing of what the structure would have looked like intact, just a short blurb on what that partial wall was, etc. And some of the better-preserved sites were also rather vague - they're not totally sure who this temple was for, and they think that might have been this, or was it this? And there's this interesting bit here, but you can't really access it (so why tell me?! Urgh!).I'm sure ancient Roman archaeology is hard to distil for your average hoard of lay-tourists. But in a site as famous and well-visited as this, I really did expect a lot more effort than was apparently put in by the overseeing authorities!Also - crawling with tour groups that'll just run you over. I found this hard to endure, heat and lack of specific information in addition.And the girl at the gate was abominably rude. :) Not my favourite spot!Palentine Hill, however, just above the gulley that is the Forum, was one of my favourites. It was far less crowded, and there was quite a lot 'still standing' left to see, as well as some breathtaking views over the Forum (and a breeze! Nice!). The palatial complex was really impressive, even in ruins. Don't miss that!"

You'll notice the scaffolding clinging to buildings nearby and don't think your pretty little eyes will be blind to the white tarps, portaloos, and workmen wandering around across the way. I haven't the faintest idea what they were building, but it was definitely not something ancient and probably not anything iconically Roman. Maybe it was a Starbucks.But you can make some nice memories here, if you accept that it is what it is: rocks and dirt. When we were there, I was wearing a white Kings of Leon shirt and out of nowhere, there came a shower of warm summer rain. We were screaming with laughter and hiding under each other's coats and my white shirt was splashed with red mud. When I got home, that red mud wouldn't wash out of my shirt. It was stained bad, but no matter. I made great friends under those jackets."

Our last visit, however, gave us a new perspective. It started out as a beautiful, sunny day, but in the middle of our visit, a storm rolled in and it started raining lightly. The sky became very dark as the storm worsened, and it produced violent thunder and lightning. The rain turned torrential. The crowds of visitors scattered and then vanished, and the Via Sacra became a river several inches deep. It would have been wonderful to wander around in an empty Forum, but it was raining much too hard for that. We couldn\u2019t help but reflect on the difficulties that must have been encountered by the ancient Romans in storms such as that. A couple of hours later, the storm passed, the sun reappeared, and all was well in Rome. We look forward another visit to the Roman Forum the next time we\u2019re in Rome."

As you walk through the columns, and what remains of once grand temples of the Forum history rushes at you. If you want to prepare well, read The Rise of Rome, by Anthony Everitt, acompelling non fiction account of the rise and glory of what was once the power and center of civilization. And the Forum was the center of their society, life, and home of the powerful. It is also just across the street from the Collesium, and close to the Circus Maximus, and a walk to the Pantheon.

There was a long line for tickets even in March and they only had 2 of the 4 ticket windows open. If you book a tour, you get to bypass the ticket lines but we did that at the Vatican and were unimpressed with how fast the tours push you through so we didn't want to do that again here. Once you get through the lines then all is well. It was about a 20-30 minute wait for us to get tickets and then another 15 minutes to get through security.That being said, it is hard to tell what you're looking at and most of the ruins aren't labeled so a tour may make more sense here. It's pretty big and takes a while to walk through so bring water and remember where the bathrooms are (they are hard to find once you're inside).One thing to note is that the line for the forum was MUCH shorter than the line for tickets to the coloseum but you can buy tickets for both the coloseum and forum at the forum. It's a much better idea if you want to see both as then you only need to wait in the security line at the coloseum (not the ticket line too) if you want to do both."

If you get a ticket for the Colosseum, the Roman Forum is included and is just a short walk from the colosseum and from the metro station.The Roman forum is a really good insight into ancient Rome and some of the ruins are stunning. You can get a really good view of the site from the terraces, where the orchards are.You need good weather for visiting, as it is all outside, and often involves a queue to get in. There appears to be no audio guides or maps (maybe I missed those) so it is probably a good idea to pay out for a guide, as there is no information as you go around.Take your time to observe and take in the significance of this place. It is worth a visit, but I recommend reading up before you go."

The Roman Forum was the centre of life in Imperial Rome, evidenced by the many remains of triumphal arches, temples and basilicas.Today, the forum known as the Forum Romanum can look like a disorderly collection of ruins to the uninitiated, but with some imagination you can see the Roman Empire come back to life at this site. Remains of many buildings from different periods are visible; the forum was littered with temples, basilicas and triumphal arches."

There is enough still standing to be able to get an idea of just how grand this forum must have been at its peak, although if you want to \u201csee\u201d the buildings as they were you will need to use your imagination, as many are little more than an odd column, like the Temple of Dioscuri (Temple of Castor and Pollux) or a low row of brick walls. Although some of the exceptions are not entirely from Ancient Rome:\u2022 The Arch of Titus is in very good condition and has the much talked and written about scene of the menorah being carried away by Roman soldiers. This carving relates to the sack of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70AD, when militant Jews went toe to toe with the Roman army. Rome won and stripped the temple of its gold and anything valuable. On the other side of the arch is Titus riding in his chariot in a triumphal procession. Check the ceiling out: It\u2019s coffered and has an interesting carving of Titus as an eagle.\u2022 Arch of Septimius Severus built in 203AD, recalls the victories of Septimius Severus over the Parthians.\u2022 The bulk of the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine. Although this is a partial ruin, there is enough still standing to show its former size. Also the ceilings have an interesting pattern on them. Built about 312AD.\u2022 Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, built in 141AD and later converted into the Church of San Lorenzo in Miranda. It is only open a couple of hours a week (Thursdays I think).\u2022 Temple of Venus and Roma thought to be the largest Temple in ancient Rome. Started by Hadrian in 121AD, finished in 141AD. Damaged by an earthquake.\u2022 Temple of Romulus which is now inside or under the Church of Santi Cosma and Damian with its fabulous bronze doors, these used to be its entrance. The entrance to the church is now on Via dei Fori Imperiali. Apparently the inside is stunning.\u2022 There are a number of very old Churches that date from 6-8th century AD, these are on the edges of the Roman Forum.All in all what is still standing is remarkable considering that the first buildings (the Regia, now just a low wall remains) were erected here in the 7th century BC. The last thing erected in the Forum was the Column of Phocas in 608AD. From the Forum there are views to Palatine Hill and the ruins there.It\u2019s worth considering wearing closed in shoes for comfort.Combined ticket Roman Forum, Palatine Hill and Colosseum.Not much shade, take a hat and water."

Used for public speeches and where political decisions were made in ancient times. It is arguably not the best preserved area, and it was a little hard to determine what the areas inside the Forum were used for originally. The Forum is included in the price into the Colosseum and I do recommend visiting. We didn't have a guide to let us know what each of the buildings were for but my friends had been there before so that helped. Some people mentioned a guide to explain things, we didn't do that but it could be a beneficial addition to the visit."

We unfortunately bought tickets online from a company called Ticketitaly for the Colleseum and the Forum who failed to keep us informed that we would have to queue just to get in through the doors of the Colloseum due to new rules, which they were aware of! Tickets clearly stated that we should aim to be there 15 minutes before allocated time slot which was entirely wrong as the queues just to get to the ticket office were at least 45 minutes long, meaning we would have missed our time slot. This company let us down badly. My wife had recently suffered a bad knee injury and can\u2019t stand for too long and we bought these tickets in good faith with the understanding that we wouldn\u2019t have to queue. Sadly this was not the case and this lack of vital prior information which should have made clear to us upon purchase meant we had no other option but to return to the hotel without visiting any of the venues that were included on the tickets. Contacting their customer service is a waste of time as all they do is palm you off with excuses. Many other ticket offers out there, avoid Ticketitaly."

However, even though it says that the ticket provides entrance for two days it only provides a one time entrance. If you try and get in a second time you will not be allowed.The queue for the Coliseum is full of people who have already booked their ticket so if you think that by buying the joint ticket you can beat the queues then forget it. When in the queue you will be approached by tour operators with the promise of getting you in without having to queue with the other saps. Take it. We paid a further 18 euros each for the honour and it was worth it.As an aside, tour operators are a bane second only to the asian guys selling selfy sticks every 20 feet. I have never been to a place as bad as Rome for street sellers. These people are unregulated and a plague on this fine city.Anyway. As I said, a lovely place to spend your day."

I would recommend that visitors enter through the side of the Colosseum and turn left, going up the hill first (but not to Palatine) and then making a right. There is a viewing platform where you can take in the full Forum prior to looking at via eye level. I think this helps you understand the grandeur of the place and then appreciate the eye level details you will get from walking around it. Also, several pathways are closed so getting this birds eye view is a better overall first strategy. After you finish this site, you walk to the Palatine (same area). Don't get there within one hour of closing as they start to move people out the gate 20 minutes before closing so you pay for 40 minutes and that is not enough time."

Bring a guidebook and glance through that and skip a guided tour. We arrived quite early, before 10 AM and as it was the first Sunday of the month admission was free. So admission was free to the Forum, the Palatine Hill and Colosseum (HUGE queues to that though). If you have the option to go on one of these \"free\" Sundays, be sure to get there early.

The Forum is another 'must see' for any first visit to Rome. There is just so much history here - it's quite amazing to walk the same streets that Julius Caesar & the senators of Ancient Rome walked. There are sign boards explaining a little bit about some of the buildings but we felt quite lost until we took out our headphones & again used our Rick Steves app on our Smartphones. Tours are available & the Forum is crowded even in off peak times so it's best to decide in advance which way you want to tour the area. There is a lot to see & much to take in."

Looking at the entrance we thought we'd be able to pop around it all within an hour, but after walking up the hill and finding out (rather foolishly) that the huge circle we'd been walking around through the day, had infact been around the forum!I'm really glad we did persuade our feet to go on a few hours longer, as it was an incredible site, with a great little museum and lots of beautiful photo opportunities. A definate must for any history buffs or art and architecture lovers!If you're on a short trip like we were, you should try and cover as much of the forum and surrounding attractions as possible in one day, as there's so many things to see in rome you'll probably not get time to come back! However if you have the luxury of a longer trip, the colosseum and forum ticket can be used over 2 days, so i'd probably recommend spreading it out, so you can really take your time to explore the whole thing :)"

But my contribution is that it is up to the individual to make that call.I went to mainly see the Colosseum, but the queue was massive so I went to Palatine Hill which connects with the Forum and allows you to skip the Colosseum line. Seeing all three sights invokes a lot of walking, and would probably be sweltering in summer. Even so, the ruins are interesting and it is all included in the single ticket price - why not make the most of it!? Overall I loved the area, it is so rich in history. Of you have the time make sure to see all three sites."

So we dropped our plans to visit the Palatine Hill and decided to head straight to the Roman Forum. We used our Roma Passes to get our first free tickets to enter. We used the Rick Steves audio guides again to make sense of the ruins. They say all roads lead to Rome or at least the Golden Milestone in the Roman Forum. But somehow, our paths didn\u2019t cross it that day! The Roman Forum was a bit tricky to navigate with an audio guide. From time to time, I was unsure if I was listening to the correct audio for the place I was viewing. The kids must have been even more out of sync with the audio guide. I do wish I had used a tour guide here. We would have got a lot more out of the visit. It was a place full of stories about Julius Caesar, Vestal Virgins, the Rostrum, Romulus that we wanted to hear about in even more detail.Later on the vacation, we picked up a book on Rome for the kids, which shows the Then and Now pictures of many Roman monuments. I wish we had come across the book before we visited the Forum. We would have experienced the already awesome Forum on entirely another level."

The place is huge and we spent several hours walking around and looking at the immense structures, there are plenty of signs giving information about the ruins although no impressions of what they would have looked like before hand. Our children enjoyed the Palatine hill area and the museum of artefacts. We took drinks in with us which was just as well, there is no where to buy drinks.

We would have had to trek back to a specified desk elsewhere in the complex to get a ticket. There should be a system whereby you can pay at the entrance to those buildings, after all there was someone there checking on entry. It should have been set up so that she could collect the fee."

Get a good guide book something small enough to carry around that has all the information on the forum and maps so you can identify where you are. It really helps we used a pocket sized DK Eye Witness Travel Book and it was a great help. Just enough information so that you know which ruin you are looking at and what its purpose was back in the day."

Also, please pay attention to the signs for exits - it was tricky to find the exit closest to the Colosseum.Regarding tickets, a ticket is valid for both the Colosseum and the Roman Forum (we paid for our tickets on-line, and with the reservation code we collected our tickets from the ticket office). We initially went to the Roman Forum, where with our printed reservation we received our tickets - we skipped the line and went straight to the ticket office to collect our tickets (n.b. there is no sign to skip the line, just go ahead to the office and ask for your tickets)."

One important caveat: if you really want to understand what you're seeing you either need to be an Ancient World history professor or sign up for a tour or hire an on-site guide. While everything is impressive even without a guide you will REALLY understand what you're seeing and be able to put all of the major \"pieces\" together.

There was no queue at the entrance (at 2pm), and we walked straight in. We also had pre-purchased a combined pass for the Colosseum and the Forum, which was only 12 euro. The Roman Forum is the ancient original site of Rome, which largely lies in ruins now after being neglected for centuries. We had a look at one of the still-standing ancient aquaducts, and walked around the \u2018shopping district\u2019 of ancient Rome. There was a really lovely view of the Arc of Constantine and the Colosseum from the higher ground of the Forum. Head in to the main area of the Forum to get a closer look at the cremation site of Julius Caesar after his assassination in 44 BC. Some of the other highlights were the Temple of Concord (167 BC), the Arch of Septimius Severus (203 AD), and the famous Rostrum, from where many famous speeches were given. The dates and history of this area is absolutely mind blowing. Don't miss it!"

We were unaware that to see the private homes you must purchase a ticket at the entrance--a very great distant from the homes themselves so we have to skip them. Also be aware that there are limited toilet facilities--the line at the museum was over a half hour long. We did find a restroom with not waiting at the far end of the Forum. From the Forum you can look down on the Circus Maximus so unless you feel a need to actually walk into the grounds you can see what you need to from above. Take along your own food and drink. We did not see any cafes on site, and get a good map of the Forum."

Open hours vary by time of year so definitely check online if you plan on arriving in the afternoon.Tickets (\u20ac12 as of Feb '15) give entry to both the Colosseum and the Roman Forum. Both are worth it!If you can, buy tickets ahead of time online (they give you an entry time) or you will stand in line like us. We tried to buy tickets online the day before, but they were either sold out or no longer available so it seems like the earlier you can do this, the better. While standing in line there was a QR code on signs in the line stating you could buy your tickets then and there and skip the line, but we didn't have internet so not sure if this would have also been unavailable. When walking up the street we noticed there was a line to the Roman Forum (on the right hand side near a gelato stand). It was very inconspicuous and we almost missed it. We stood in line for a good 30 minutes even thought the line was relatively short. On the right hand side, people that had pre-booked and group tours just walked right up and traded in their internet printout for tickets. We then went to have lunch and were able to walk right into the Colosseum first, before our tour of the Forum, past the ENORMOUS line of people. It was very unorganized, with no indication of where to walk in if you have a ticket. We just pushed our way in and through, but I would bet people with tickets thought they had to wait, too. There is a separate route to the left for those with tickets and groups.There are two entrances to the Forum that we could find, the one where we bought tickets and another that is easy to enter when exiting the Colosseum. This is the one we went into.It was amazing walking around and exploring. It didn't feel too crowded and there were lots of photo ops of the city when you're very high up. We saw some people having picnics although I'm not sure if this is allowed.Great experience!"

Once the heart of the Roman republic, this was where the likes of Caesar made speeches. It's ruined now, but you can still see buildings and temples in various states of disrepair. You do need a bit imagination, and whilst there is some information there isn't a great deal, so I would recommend a good guidebook or a guided tour. You will share the experience with plenty of other visitors. There is not a lot of shade and so ensure you take a hat, suncream and plenty of water, especially if visiting in the middle of the day in summer. There's quite a bit of walking around to do, sometimes on uneven ground, so wear flat shoes. Read up on your Roman history - through novels like Robert Harris' Cicero books if you prefer - before you visit and it will all mean a lot more to you."

As you enter the area you walk past by an old well preserved archway that was surely felt the feet of many Romans as they walked through it. Past this gateway you find yourself looking down into a small valley that stretches away from you into the distance, full of various ruins that still stand despite the passing of centuries. On your left hand side is the Palatine hill, the seat of the Roman Emperors, overlooking the valley while an old Roman road of slabs stretch down towards the valley floor.This is the start of the Roman Forum, an ancient heart deep within modern Rome. Walking around the valley floor is a deep solemn experience, stepping in a piece of history. Words can't describe the experience, you have to see it for yourself to fully appreciate it. It is not just the forum; there is also the Palatine Hill, where the Emperors once lived and you can see the ruins there of their palaces and places of relaxation and entertainment.There is a lot to see here and you can easily spend a whole afternoon walking around, taking in the view and generally enjoying the epic landscape. There is some information scattered around to tell you what ruins are which but mostly you have to use the illustrations and your mind to imagine what the forum would have once looked like.You can pay for the forum and hill seperately or you can, as we did, take a guided tour of the neighbouring coliseum as we did which has the admission price for the forum and hill included in the cost. Between the two of these sites you have enough to see for satisfying yourself for a day's sightseeing within Rome."

I would recommend having a guide - I did not and didn't get as much from my visit of several hours as I might have done (the pocket-sized green guidebooks available for sale are of little use and signposting leaves a little to be desired, but understandable to preserve the appearance). The views from the higher part are great and the variety of buildings there impressive. A few things are blocked off at present, and there was a fair bit of gardening going on, the teams of men in hi-vis outfits detracting from things a little. But overall, this is an essential place to visit for real understanding of the operation of Roman Rome.

This is another one of those attractions you see in Rome where your perspective will be greatly influenced by your knowledge of history and your ability to see past a few columns, broken stones and stairs and instead visualize the center of Roman life. So little has been done with so many of these magnificent antiquities that one has to wonder if Italians see them at all for more than the few dollars they bring in. There are several guided tours. As so many others they are hit and miss. They all do their best but often times what's interesting to you may not be anything at all to the guide. For example, I ran into a group high above the Forum on Palatine hill and waited until they were finished in order to take a photo. After about 10 minutes I was convinced the guide was giving a lecture on Travertine. He didn't just mention it in passing, he lectured on it as if he had done his dissertation on it! That may be fascinating to him but I gave up on the photo and moved on. On the other hand, if I had paid 30+ Euros like each of the group had I wouldn't have been a happy camper. The Forum is a fascinating part of ancient Rome but sadly has been allowed to sit and decay."

The busyness of the forum faded away, apart from some photo op areas of the city from above, and one could go under, around, and through the ruins. There were wide open spaces and nooks and crannies where you could enjoy the echoing of running water bouncing off the old walls. It was also quite romantic, especially the garden area, if the couple making out intensely for at least 10 minutes (with some associated derriere-rubbing) is any indication.

On a sunny and warm May's day, I decided to explore Roman Forum and Palatine Hill.The bought ticket included visits to Forum, Palatine Hill and Colosseum. The stroll through these sites was a pleasant experience. The nice weather and lush nature in spring have been the additional advantages for my beautiful experience.Roman Forum, as the gorgeous center of the ancient world /caput mondo/, included the monuments from two periods of history: Republica and Empire. I had a huge pleasure to discover the following: the Curia (Senate House), the triumphal Arch of Septimus Severine, the temple of Saturn, the basilica Julia, Venera temple, Trajan's terme... The three white columns with the emphasized elegance, that belonged to Castor and Polux temple, impressed me the most. While I walked along the main street of Roman Forum, called Via Sacra /Sacred Way/, I could imagine victorious emperor and generals returning from war paraded over this street.The red flowers, called Oriental poppies, bloomed up inside and around ruins of Roman Forum, created a stunning picture, composed of natural beauty and historical charm. These red flowers spread over Palatine Hill made the most beautiful flowery carpet. Amazing!Today, Roman Forum preserved a field of ruins that honestly tells us a little about Rome's original splendor. Although, it still manages to evoke the splendor of ancient Rome. We could learn how the old Romans had an excellent feeling and skills for organization of the city, the urban plan of its streets and buildings. The Romans have built Forum in order to celebrate Rome. The engineers have searched for urban solutions that will fascinate by its monumentality and magnificent in accordance with the grand Rome empire. This Forum served as model how to build other forums: Cesar's, August's, Trajan's, Vespasian's. Overall, I passed with pleasure through almost 3000 years of history. Dear visitors of Rome, I would like to enjoy discovering this site as I did."

This historic site is unique and while it is a ruin it gives you a very good insight into the center of one of the greatest empires in the world. There is so much to see that we believe a guide is a must, otherwise you will need to plan out your visit carefully. There is not a lot of information on the individual items as a matter of fact the labeling is very poor. While the guides can be very talkative and at times too much was being said, in our opinion it was well worth the money.We found it amazing so ensure you allow plenty of time as. To see the places from the stories around the Roman Empire and Julius Caesar was incredible. You can even see where Julius Caesar was killed.While this place is truly amazing there are some negatives including it can be a little difficult walking (broken/uneven ground), very little shade and generally there are lots of people visiting. We visited the place as part of a Backroads of Italy tour and so the queues were not a problem.My suggestion is to also take sunglasses, a hat and some water.We would happily revisit this place again."

These are incredibly important sites for an experience of ancient Rome, and a 'must see', but there are several features that reduce its accessibility in terms of understanding what it was all about. There is a serious shortage of information on the sites themselves. No audio guides. Occasional sign boards give info on specific parts, unrelated to the overall scenario, and not providing any context. These seem extremely dated. While it is pleasant to be able to wander around at will, this can make it seem like a jumble. A proportion of individual sites were under protective cover, some no doubt in the process of excavation, but again, little or no info on progress. In fact it looks to me as if any work that was underway has now stalled, due to lack of funds. The shortage of signage even extends to finding your way to one of the various exits. (In the meantime, all along one side of the Forum, outside the site itself, 'they' are constructing Line C, the third of Rome's Metro lines. Some of the ancient buildings have jacks propping them up! I bet the decision to build the Line here was very controversial. 83 months work scheduled, which I reckon will mean another 6 years worth approximately). My suggestion is that visitors should either join a guided tour or buy and study a good guide book- oh and know plenty about Roman history before you get there."

The House of Livia was closed for some reason, and the House of Augustus has limited opening hours, and we were too late.

Amazing to imagine walking in ancient Roman footsteps. For younger kids, highly recommend purchasing the \"Rome Reconstructed\" book which has photos of what the Colosseum and Forum look like now, along with overlays that show what the area looked like 2000 years ago. Helps the kids see that the area was once more than old ruins. The forum is stroller capable but there are a few stairs and on the Palatine hill side, the cobble stone and gaps make pushing a stroller difficult but doable."

At the Roma termini train station, you will get a metro-bus day costing of 6 Euros. From Roma termini you must use the metro trains, Metro line A this train takes you to the Colosseum station. The Colosseum is great building which was once used by the emperor of Roma to punish the prisoners by arranging a game of fight. The Roman forum has a beautiful church where you can see the beautiful paintings inside the church. Also there is a museum inside which has entrance fee. Overall the Rome is very beautiful city to visit.The weather is also good & you can find many visitors from all over the world visiting the city. Also you will find Indian restaurants to enjoy the Indian food at Ottorio Emanuale Metro station .It's worth visiting Roma once in your lifetime."

I was very disappointed that we were not given any sort of information or map on a leaflet about the sites. We did the Colosseum on the first day and the Forum and Palatine on the second. When we arrived at the Forum we expected to be given a leaflet there, showing a map of the sites and their names but weren't given anything on admission. I believe this must be different if you buy tickets at the entrance as I saw lots of people with red information leaflets. So we felt a bit \"lost\" a lot of the time. There are boards around the Forum with information on what was in front of you but the site is huge and if you can't walk the whole site you need some sort of information in advance on which way to go round.As someone with moderate walking difficulties, I found the Forum really hard and would definitely recommend you to start at the top of Palatine Hill and walk down, not the opposite as we did (all uphill and hard work on the uneven ground)"

As others have said, it's very much worth booking online for this attraction, or if this isn't convenient/possible, get your ticket from the ticket office at the Forum where there isn't a queue (or wasn't when we visited) - this saves you waiting in the very long queue for the Collosseum. The ticket covers all 3 attractions, and is good for two days - if you get tired out or feel you have missed some of it you can come back in the following day.What's to say about these ruins which hasn't already been said? The Collosseum is hugely impressive, and it's striking just how much is left intact. When we visited there was a fascinating exhibition about the development of reading and libraries in the Roman era which we found fascinating and kept us entertained for an hour or so. The Collosseum itself is as you see it in all the pictures, but it is extremely crowded and it's a bit irritating queueing up behind people taking selfies to see the view. I guess that's what it was like when the place was still in use (the crowds, not the selfies!) so perhaps that's appropriate.Crossing the road to the Roman Forum takes you out of the crush of people - there are plenty about, but not so much that you can't relax and enjoy your visit. This is a place that is just steeped in history - a short walk up the hill to where Romulus and Remus were found by a wolf according to the myth reveals the extensive remains of the Imperial Palace - this is where the word \"palace\" came from. There are information boards in English and Italian which fill in a lot of the gaps. I appreciate this as I'm not great at doing research in advance of this kind of visit, and it's so extensive that I wouldn't remember it anyway, and there's a danger of just looking at a pile of old rocks and walls and not knowing what they are. This is not a problem here, and there is plenty of information available for the casual visitor.Back down the hill there are extensive remains of the Roman Forum itself. Like most excavations and remains in Rome you have to look at all this from behind a fence - it's not like many archaeological sites in Greece and Turkey where you can roam around freely - and rightly so, they've lasted a couple of thousand years but I'm not sure they'd last so well if thousands of tourists could just tramp around.Overall, definitely worth braving the crowds - you can't come to Rome and not visit here."

Their comments and details helped to bring to life the fabulous history of the Roman Empire which was governed from the Forum and was, effectively, the capital of the civilised world. The architecture and design were still evident and showed the tremendous imagination of the ancient Romans as well as their flair for organisation and government even though they were, apparently, brutally ruthless. They didn't have air travel and yet they reached far-flung lands with armies equipped and trained to win battles and to impose Roman laws. No-emails or telephones to aid communication and yet they succeeded wherever they went with the backing of government centred in the Forum. A really historic world site."

I first visited the Roman Forum 15 years ago and was underwhelmed then. In May 2014 we visited Rome again and I thought I'd give it another try. But I have no desire to return. Part of the problem this time was the signage and routing was inadequate and confusing. We met other tourists who shared similar experiences there.

Use the entrance on Via di San Gregorio for the Palantine. This cost us 12 Euros each and there were no crowds or line up. There is a bit of uphill climbing here as your visit the ruins but it is mostly downhill which leads you to the Roman Forum and the Via Sacra. If you enter the Roman Forum first by using the entrance on Via dei Foro Imperiali, you have a lot of uphill walking to do into the Palantine Hill. So it depends on how tired you are the time. Remember, this ticket is now good for entering the Colosseum which we did the next day. You avoid all the crowds and line ups at the Colosseum with this ticket and avoid everyone trying to buy their ticket to enter the Colosseum. It took us about 5 minutes to get into the Colosseum this way. So in order, to avoid line ups and depending how tired you are, do the Palantine Hill, followed by the Roman Forum and then the Colosseum. All wonderfully historic of course so do some reading ahead of time so you know what you are looking at in each area."

We then headed to the Roman Forum, opposite the colosseum and were pleasantly surprised to find that our ticket for that also allowed us entry to the colosseum at no extra cost. It is \u20ac12 and is valid for 2 days. We walked around the Roman Forum and Pallantine Hill and went back to the colosseum the next day, skipping everyone in the queue to head straight in without queueing for more than 30 seconds. I can not recommend this enough. Do no queue for a ticket- head to the Roman Forum and buy your ticket there and walk straight on in... And feel so glad you are not queueing for hours in the sun (just like we almost did!)!!"

Its worth it to know the history of Colosseum.** The ticket line is always huge. Prebooking can be done. Another idea which we used is to stand in line of Roman Forum which is usually smaller and try finding an official guy searching for guided tour candidates. You can thus skip the line and then buy a ticket valid for both Roman Forum and Colosseum."

It had 11.30am on the voucher and the instruction to arrive 15 minutes before this to collect our tickets. We eventually found out that there was no point at all in booking beforehand. We joined a huge queue at Palatine for reserved tickets in the raging mid day sun. We endured the queue for an hour and had to put up with the annoying illegal vendors trying to sell you things to find our ticket was not timed. When we saw the queue to actually get in to the colloseum we decided not to join it. Fortunately the ticket was valid for two days and we returned the next day at 5pm and walked straight in. We wouldn't recommend buying tickets online and paying a booking fee but turn up very early or at the end of the day instead. That said, the colloseum itself is amazing. It is currently being renovated so the outside is covered with scaffolding but inside you can still experience the age of the structure and learn about the events held here. You have to visit when in Rome."

One should truly spend at least 2-3 days to really appreciate all that this area has to offer. There was so much architecture to see with such eclectic history and origin that you MUST do this area with a guide!We spend three hours one morning between these sites with a guided tour which I would highly recommend (Real Roman Tour). Without a tour you don't get access into some of the great locations in the Colosseum, and you miss out on some of the history behind the Palatine Hill and Roman Forum. Sure you can find lots of the information in a guide book, but you'd likely to have to carry 3 guidebooks, plus a Rick Steves tour to get the same amount of detail in the same amount of time. The extra money was well spent, just to get into the underground of the Colosseum was worth every additional Euro spent!!Bring a water bottle, sunscreen, and comfortable walking shoes. You spend all your time on your feet, and walking on the uneven cobblestones can take a quick toll on you if you are not prepared."

At 930am there were three people in the queue...wonderful. We had downloaded the Rick Steves audio guide for the area (and maps) and we were so glad we did. Each of us had this audio on our phones and we were able to chat and sort of \"half listen\" and discuss things that interested us. Without some type of guide, we would have missed so much of the history and stories. We took lots of photos and really enjoyed the Forum area. There are a couple of public fountains (really more of a hose) located within the gates, so bring your water bottles and continually keep them full. It has been very warm in Rome recently. We spent about two hours in the Forum area and then headed to the Colosseum. This is an extremely busy area with vendors and tour groups. I had purchased our underground and third ring tickets by calling Italy about three weeks prior to our arrival. Call during operating hours and when you get the first recording in Italian, hit 0. This should take you to another recording and then you will be put on the hold queue. It was maybe 2-3 minutes before someone came on the line. I immediatley said \"English, please\" and she switched to speaking English. After that, we did have to repeat a few things, but were able to get the tickets and before I hung up I already had the email confirmation in my inbox. When we arrived at the Colosseum, we went to the head of the line and the security person directed us which queue to follow. We had to go inside and find the \"online ticket\" line and waited maybe 5 minutes to get out tickets. We were told the number of our \"meeting area\" and those are a bit further down the hall....passed the restrooms. We had about an hour before our tour to explore on our own. Then, we went and met our group. Our guide had a microphone and we each had an audio phone. But, mostly we could just listen to her without it. Definitely do this tour. Getting to go into the areas not accessible without the tour was amazing. There are a lot of stairs, so not great for the really young or anyone unsteady with a lot of walking. There is also a water hose inside the Colosseum and the line was never more than about 8-10 people while we were there in the hottest part of the day."

Do yourself a favour and buy a ROMA PASS! You can get them at most train stations, mini newsagents and also online. You can find the details at http://www.romapass.it and it should be around $36. It saved us HOURS in the line and plenty of money. You walk straight in, it gets you into Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum as well as unlimited transport services within the 48 hours and discounted entry to plenty more places. It took us about 2hours to walk our way through the Colosseum and we bought an audio tour for $5euro once inside, which lets you play information at certain points and take your time. It was fantastic. Do not fall into the trap of buying the tours from randoms outside for $25 euros, so not worth it and the Audiotour tells you all the same details. BUY WATER OUTSIDE! There is none inside, only water fountains from the wall which you can drink but without a bottle and long lines, buying outside is better. It's fine to buy water from the men walking around saying 'water, $1 euro, ice $1 euro', they look suspect but its fine and heaps cheaper than that set up stalls for $5 euros. Set aside a good 4-6 hours to cover the Colosseum, Palatine Hill and Roman Forum and do it around 3pm to catch the perfect sunlight for shots. AMAZING."

Tour Palatine Hill and Roman Forum on the day you purchase. Bring some water--it can be really hot with little shade. Then, use your same ticket THE NEXT MORNING at Colosseum. You'll beat the crowds in the door, skip the line, and enjoy the amazing space. There is not much signage or interpretative guidance, so read your tour book and download an audio tour for your phone or ipod. It is a very impressive structure, one that will awe even the seasoned tourist. With a little advance planning, you can survive it and will be glad you went."

I have visited Colosseum before but this time with two kids so I was more aware of the logistics etc.We visited pretty much at peak August and around midday. There are two obvious ways of doing this and the temptation for jumping the queue and joining a guided tour is obvious. The queue looks short from the outside but it winds its way inside too and likely takes at least an hour to an hour and a half. This was you can purchase adult tickets for 12euro each and kids under 18 are free. If you go guided you walk in but you pay on top of this 13euro ish for the guide, per person. I really dont see that is worth doing as the audio guides are 5euro and give you very specific and in depth guidance at your own pace.The place is worth seeing and if your kids have a specific interest in Rome from school or films like Gladiator it helps too. Overall you can probably get much of the spectacle from wandering the perimetre without paying a penny but its a nice place to have been inside and learned more about. I'd join the queue and get it over with."

If you doubt the architecture part of it, go see the Colosseum, Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum. The technological breakthrough of the arch made so much possible-- domes, arches, more. The Colosseum was once composed of three rings of arches. The Triumphant Arches along the Apian Way pronounce military victor from ages past. The Basilica of the Forum with its arches was where the Romans went for law, news, and more. It is almost incomprehensible to walk amongst these ruins and not been impressed that the Colosseum was built in 8 years. Sagrada Familia in Barcelona has been under construction for a hundred years. The Apian Way is in better shape than many roads in Detroit in the US. I would recommend to anyone going to this historical sight to go with a guide so that you know what each of the areas actually was. Also take a water bottle."

You still have to pick up your tickets there but for 2 euros more the queue is much shorter.I thought it might be over-hyped as an attraction but it isn't at all. The size and construction are amazing and you have to be inside to appreciate it. It takes very little imagination to see it as it was in its heyday and you feel the weight of its history. Although it is full of people it is so big that you don't feel too crowded and can get the views you want inside and out. There is some scaffolding on the outside but I expect there always will be so don't be put off by it. You can access the forum opposite. It is steeped in history but rather confusing as poorly signed. We didn't have time to visit the Palatine which may have been better. It is amazing to walk in the footsteps of Caesar, Augustus, Cicero et al though."

You will be able to skip the line and walk straight in, saving you probably thirty minutes.We visited in August 2014 while they were doing some restoration work, which was a little disappointing. We couldn't go into the bottom tunnels area, which we've read they've opened to tourists in recent years. We also toured the Palatine Hill area, which was included in the price of the ticket to the Colosseum. This is worth a visit, as well. BUT, as you're leaving Palatine Hill, ASK WHERE THE EXITS ARE. We walked in circles for thirty minutes before we found it, even with asking, and we weren't the only ones doing that - no one could find the exit. It's like they don't want you to leave. "

This allowed us to avoid the (incredibly long, sometimes 2+ hours) lines to the Colosserm, as the guides have access to a separate line which is very fast.The site itself is definitely worth a visit, although without the explanations of the guide (or an equivalent audio guide or in-depth guidebook) you will miss out on many of the fascinating points.Definitely worth going but plan in advance to make the most out of it."

            "review": "Guided tour is worth it. Amazing place. Completely awe-inspiring to think that this was built at a time when our country was making do with mud huts.We booked the official guided tour at the Coloseum itself. This seemed like a very good value, for a number of reasons. Firstly, when we arrived, it was the first Sunday of the month and it had just been announced that admission would be free on these days. As a result, it was particularly busy, although I have never been before so maybe this was just normal for school holidays in the summer. Anyway, they had big signs up saying that admissions would be restricted to 3000 people for safety reasons. We joined the long queue for admission, but the queue seemed to come to a stop. I'm not sure if this was just temporary, but we were very thankful that when we showed the guy at the gate our online booking for a guided tour we were waved straight through.Secondly, our guide was extremely knowledgeable and she had actually worked as an archaeologist at the site and was therefore able to give us a lot of insight into the building. For instance, she was able to explain that the common idea that the Coliseum was flooded in order to re-enact maritime battles is almost certainly wrong.Thirdly, and most importantly, being with a guide means that you have access to lots of areas that are otherwise not allowed for people with general admission. For instance, when you go onto the arena floor you do so at an entirely separate roped off area so you just have one tour party around you rather than hundreds of milling people. Plus, if you book the right ticket, you get to see underground at the Coliseum, and also the higher floors which again are not available to people on general admission.It is pretty easy to book the guided tours. You can't do this online, but if you go to the website they give the phone number for the call centre and I found that they speak very good English."

I think we paid about 14EUR each, for the whole thing, and after you've strolled around the Forum, inside to the Museum and up Palatine Hill, then you can enter the Colosseum and walk straight through - no queuing!!!The Forum was the bit I was most looking forward to and it didn't disappoint - the history is phenomenal and you can breathe in the atmosphere - it is stunning. Uneven footpaths with loose stones etc, not ideal for lighter footwear, wheelchairs, or prams. The museum is fantastic with lots of items that have been found over the years - there is still on-going archaeological projects, but it didn't detract from our visit.The Colosseum - breathtaking!! It was unbelievably quiet - which was bizarre considering how busy it was when we were there - both times (2012 and 2014). The queues for this historical attraction were horrific - take my advice - buy the combo ticket at the Forum!! There are toilets here, I'm sure I saw a sign for a lift, and you can have a guided tour if you prefer, we chose not to and just wander, which suited us. There is also a little gift shop on the way out - reasonable enough.You can buy tickets in advance, but to be honest, if you buy them at the Forum there is no need - there is never a queue there, not that I saw anyway, and we have spent quite a few days of both our holidays around this area.This is a definite MUST SEE!!!"

The line at the Colosseum is generally longer than the other sites so buy your tickets at one of the others so when you get to the Colosseum you just need to go through security. Also, use Rick Steve's free audio guides for these sites. Very educational and good if you're on a budget. We went on a rainy/stormy day which was actually awesome since it have the place a spooky aura which was fun, and it was not very crowded. You can't come to Rome and not visit these sites, so do it and hopefully these tips can help you maximize your visit!"

The view is also beautiful from this area. We didn't have a tour guide, but it would have been nice to have one to describe the ruins and the history. Make sure you buy tickets (colosseum/forum/palatine hill) online- the lineups are very long and it's not worth wasting time waiting in line in the hot sun! We entered the forum around 11 am and it was very crowded, often it was very slow and difficult to walk- you need to make your way around the tour groups and many people. We could have definitely spent more time here, but it was too hot and crowded to see or enjoy much more of the forum. We then headed off the palatine hill - less crowded."

We also recommend the tour guide in roman forum. She was amazing (ambra I think is her name) , we ordered it at the counter itself just for 5 euros pps but defo worth it, maybe can buy from the website! Some of the monuments may not look interesting at all until we know the history eg julius caesar's place , the place where he was cremated was under the roof and believe it or not til this day some ppl still give offerings to him eg food , coins, flowers!! Again beware of Trojan heroes asking whether u want a picture. It s a scam! Ask them first how much if you want. Saw a few got conned, they were surrounded. And also beware of men with dozens of roses in hand! They will try to give some to the lady in the group first after that will pester the man for money and refused to take back the roses!

Several others with an orange sticker placed on their chest were waiting in the same area, phew. Our tour guide's name was Paulo who was working through the Discover Rome Walking Tours company. He was a great tour guide. He spoke clearly with amicrophone and speaker so the whole group could hear. He gave us some good insight as to the history behind the Colosseum. The Colosseum tour was followed by an approximately 30 minute education session from David about Ancient Rome and the Forum whilst sitting by the Palatine Hill. This introduction was also very interesting and led us to book a further tour with David that night. You can buy drinks and food at the Colosseum. TOILETS--- we had some trouble finding them as they aren't signed well around the area. We could only find one set of toilet, they were to the left of the exit from the Colosseum.

The forum is breath taking. Far more impressive than the Vatican Museums - which are really rather overwhelmingly boring, with the sole exception of the Sistine Chapel. The Vatican Museums have been filled up with a lot of average sculpture, which centuries of Pope's basically acquired at no cost. As soon as they had to start paying for it the quantity and quality of work drops right off (e.g., 1 Rodin, 2 Chagall, etc. etc.)"

Also - we had high school students with us that would have been free if they had their passports!!!?? Another rule that changes on a daily whim apparently. They were obviously young, and had their student ID's , but the cashier wanted passports...which we didn't carry with us :\\ So we paid entry for the students too. Still well worth it!

You will notice here that future Emperors had their forums; headquarters ,in the immediate area , like fan clubs for supporters to rally around. Lots of intrigue !!! Be real careful about robbers here; in just two days of walking here , we have personally witnessed a lady being assaulted by an attempted snatch and grab thief and a lady with a group of children having her money and cards stolen; all in broad daylight with police nearby and people all around. Do not rely on the police as they are just showponies and the locals just shrug their shoulders as if this happens daily; don't be the victim.

Useless saying that it's a must in Rome.As an Italian I can give you a few usefull tips for making your visit easier.Be carefull in buying tickets: don't trust the people who try to sell them out of the Colosseum claiming you will skip the queue (they are often not regular sellers), you can buy the tickets at the ticket office of the Fori Imperiali with very small line and then avoid the queue at the Colosseum, for the right price.Don't get the double audioguide for 8\u20ac, get only one for 5.50 and bring your earcuffs (from your phone) and use those instead, it's the same.Prefer going during lunch time, there's less people.The ticket is valid for 24 hours, so it is a good idea to visit the sites in following days so you don't get overflowed and can enjoy more.At last always carry a little bottle of water from the supermarket, if you buy near the attractions you overpay everything (in general).If you plan with intelligence you enjoy more and spend less! Have a good visit!"

We were approached by one of the guides outside of the colosseum selling \"private tours\" of the colosseum and forum (45 minutes each). We (3 of us) elected to do this so we did not have to wait in the long lines. However, we ended up waiting about 10 to 15 minutes whilst the guide had enough people for the private tour. Our group ended up being about 25 people. Upon entering the colosseum we waited another 5 to 10 minutes (I think the guide was purchasing our tickets). After this we went out into the colosseum and were guided under a shaded arch where the guide gave us some information on the colosseum. He was difficult to understand and hear. We stayed here for about 15 minutes then literally went around the corner to another shaded arch and stopped again for another 10 minutes. After this, the guide announced he would not be taking us over to the forum as it was too hot and 3 tourists had collapsed with the heat the day before. We had the option of visiting the colosseum by ourselves, or meet back up with him 2 hours later! (They obviously knew this before they sold us the tickets). Needless to say, this was very disappointing and a waste of money. The colosseum was interesting, but really not worth all the hype."

Ignore all this and try this.All 3 places can be accessed on a common ticket and instead of buying it from Colosseum buy it from Roman Forum or Palatine Hill. The ticket counter at Roman Forum Exit that leads to main road (where artist are performing with spray paints, somewhere opposite to a Tourist office) is a hidden wonder which hardly had any queue. Buy your ticket there and save hours. Either get a pass before hand or try this else wait can be painful."

There are tours offered (and you can book ahead of time, or at the gates, but, if you want to book at tour of the Colosseum at the gate, you will still have to wait in the huge line. There are also unofficial tours that you can book outside the Colosseum that form tour groups on the spot. I have heard mixed reviews about all of the Colosseum tours, weather official or not (but, if you want to go to the \"basement\" or the third level, you have to be on a special tour (9 EUR, plus the online booking fee of, I think, 2 EUR if you do not want to wait in the line. You cannot book this tour from anywhere other than the Colosseum ticket booth) offered via the main website: http://www.coopculture.it/en/colosseo-e-shop.cfm). I did not go on any of the Colosseum tours, I just know they exist because I almost did the one that allows you to go to the \"basement,\" but I opted for a cheaper tour of the Roman Forum instead (5 EUR, also the cost of the basic, official tour of the Colosseum and the official tour of Palatine Hill).I spent 5 hours among these three sites, including a one-hour tour. I would recommend a tour of either the Forum or Palatine Hill to give yourself some idea of what you are seeing. I have read a lot of negative things about the audio guides; but, at the same time, the tour in no way covered everything there (but, then again, there is so much to see that I don't know how it possibly could include everything there). There was so much to see that I can understand how the audio guide would become very boring very quickly. Also, as others have said, if you do not purchase a Roma Pass, buy your tickets at either the Palatine Hill or Roman Forum ticket booth (both located within 5 minutes of the Colosseum with SIGNIFICANTLY smaller lines). Then, you will be able to skip the huge line at the Colosseum. Even if you do not intend to enter the Roman Forum / Palatine Hill, I would still buy my tickets there just to avoid the Colosseum line."

It flows right into the Forum so we did both with very little crowds. From there, you exit out the side and it is a short walk to the Colosseum. When we got there we heard the line for tickets was 1 hour 45 minutes. We breezed through because we had purchased our tickets at Palatine Hill. Go early in the day to avoid the heat and the crowds and wear comfortable shoes. We used the free Rick Steves app for our audio tour and it was perfect. You can print the maps ahead of time so you don't need to jump back and forth on the app to see where you are going. We were also glad we brought water bottles - there are fountains around the area that provide a cool refreshment.The only bad part of the day was getting back to our hotel. It took over an hour for our bus to come and it was jammed with people. We had to push our way on and that was miserable. I wish we had figured out a better way to get home (we were tired from all the walking and did not see any taxis).

We chose to take a lunch break between the Roman Forum and Colosseum, which got us out of the heat for a bit. Wear sunscreen, a hat, and lightweight clothes - there isn't much shade at any of the locations, and you'll be hot in the summer! The tour groups are obnoxious, so be prepared, but you'd be cheating yourself out of a great experience if you miss these sites. Oh!

            "review": "Visiting the Roman Forum is a must. The Roman Forum is a fascinating place. I don't think you realize the scale of the Forum if all you see are pictures. Once you are there it becomes apparent that the Forum is much larger than you imagined. There are three questions you must ask to determine your visit. 1) What kind of ticket? 2) Do you need a tour? 3) How long? If you are going to visit at least two major historic sites and/or museums, minus the Vatican, and use public transportation I would suggest the Roma Pass. It is worth the investment. If you are not familiar with Roman history and do not wish to read all of the interpretive signs you might want to seek out a tour. Make sure it is a legitimate tour worth investing in. I have a masters in history and my wife loves Roman history so we did the visit on our own. It will take you a couple of hours to go through the Forum and Palatine Hill quickly. If you plan on taking your time it will take longer. The ticket includes the Forum, Palatine Hill, and the Colosseum. Palatine Hill is where the Roman Emperor's palace was located and the ruins are worth visiting. Enjoy your visit and if you don't want to invest in a tour but do not know much about Rome get a guidebook, history book, or just do some intense research before visiting."

You could get them there but the line was longer so just get them ahead of time and save yourself. As in many European tourist attractions, there can be some line entrance confusion. So make sure you are in the correct line! There is nothing worse than waiting an hour to find our you are in the wrong line! We went about 15 minutes before the Colosseum opened. There was a line for ppl with tickets and a line for people without tickets. As soon as the building opened, our line for ppl with tickets went through so quickly! Definitely do this! We actually had about 20 minutes in the Colosseum when there was hardly anyone there:) We downloaded the Rick Steves audio guide for this and that was PERFECT. There were audio guides for purchase but the Rick Steves one was great! We probably spent about 1 hour inside. We could stay on the ground floor and go up a floor. I think the underground is only for special tour groups. You'll have to decide how much money you want to spend. After the Colosseum we walked across the street to the Forum entrance. We also did the Rick Steves tour for this. We skipped Palatine hill because our feet were tired. This was about 10:30 am now and the crowds were picking up but still okay. this time of year though, it will get hot and you will get sunburned so be careful! There really isn't a line for the Forum and Palatine Hill, so do the Colosseum first and then these."

Even if you decide to go inside on a different day visit the outside of the Colosseum and Forum on a Sunday; the road between the sites is closed to traffic on Sundays and you get excellent views (and photo opportunities) for the Colosseum from the middle of the road. Check before you buy the Roma ticket, I think the Colosseum ticket gets you into the Forum and Palatine (and the other way around); I don't think you need to pay more for the Roma ticket. You will be accosted by lots of ticket sellers telling you what a fabulous deal they have saving you lots of money; we found the best deal was the normal entrance price paid on the way in.If any of your party are 24 or under take a photocopy of their passport for a greatly reduced entry cost.The unauthorised street merchants will sell you cold or frozen water at less than half the price of the vans and shops."

Why don't they hand out maps for the sights with routes on how to best cover the sights and some basic information? The signage was inadequate at these locations as well. Also, some signs used non-Italian languages and some did not. Often we had to walk a fair distance before finding out that a sight was closed, when it could have been posted on the approaching path or road much sooner. Perhaps the tour companies have enough influence to keep it confusing for tourists so that they are more apt to hire the tour guides? Clearly the guided groups were favored by not requiring them to stand in the main lines. How about some large displays on how the sights actually looked (color and all) when they were at their prime. I saw no such displays. So many buildings and ruins that were open other times were closed for restoration or other reasons, at the height of tourist season. The museum for Palatine Hill was closed when we were there in July!"

We had booked the tour in advance and were able to just go past the line with our tour group. When our daughter went with us last year, I had done my research in the forums on TA and found that you could purchase tickets on the hill and the wait would be much shorter than the ticket office at the Colosseum itself. I had worries when I saw the very long line even at the office on the hill (lots of TA followers, I'm sure) but once we saw the other line, we were glad we had followed the advise!When you enter at the Hill you have a chance to walk thru the gardens and ruins and then on to walking thru the Forum to get to the Colosseum. It is all quite lovely! Beware of pick pockets and all the pushy sales people with fake designer goods as you walk up to the Colosseum entrance. This kind of activity is all over Europe at tourist attractions, so you just need to be aware and be cautious.The Colosseum is magnificent! The first time we went it was almost overwhelming. Don't be in a hurry! Take your time and sit on a step. Think about what you've read in the history books and take the place in! Lions on the floor. Gladiators on their horses with weapons ready. Caesar in the stands giving his nod. Amazing to be in the place where so much happened in history!When you go without a group you have the chance to linger longer. Walk around and experience it on all sides. If it is your first visit at least get the hand held guide to help understand. If you don't utilize the Hill ticket office. try to pre order tickets. The line is always long and I promise it will help. Enjoy!"

When we tried later to receive our refund, they asked for our paid stubs. I gave them what they wanted and then they said they could not issue a refund. This is after I was told I could by the gatekeeper and ticket office personal. 21 euros is almost 50 dollars. This was after i fully paid for the event the day before. They are rude and uncaring. They denied everything. Watch your money. Don't believe these people. Bad management and worthless supervisors. i ended up paying alot of money to see this event that should be free. Dishonest people at the forum gate. Watch our for yourself and if they tell you an event is included ask them what and how you are guaranteed entrance."

We did the Eternity in a Day tour, which bypassed the Forum, but we got a little explanation of it from the outside. The next day we used our Colosseum tickets to get into the Roman Forum. I feel we should have probably gotten a guided tour through this place as it contains SOOOO much history and we couldn't really get a solid explanation of everything we were looking at and what took place in some areas until after the fact (i.e. Rostra, where Mark Antony gave Julius Caesar's euology). Signs are marked on some monuments throughout but it's short and leaves you wanting more knowledge of what you're looking at. Temple of Jupiter was impressive as well as the Arches. Worth spending about 1.5 hour there, after that you kind of get sick of looking at stuff in there, esp when all you have is a guidebook. Try to get a guided tour and justs get past the idea of walking in a group and wearing the funny headsets they give you. If you're a tourist, you're going to stand out regardless with all the water you carry, buying stuff from the street vendors and the likely backpack you're going to be wearing. It's not worth trying to blend in by avoiding the guided tours. I wish we would have. Not sure if Walks of Italy has a tour that actually goes into the forum. Check out their website though, we had very knowledgeable guides through the Colosseum and Vatican on the tour we did do."

It's a combo ticket with the Colosseum, you cannot buy separate entrance. The ticket is good for 48 hours, but important to note that if you enter a site on day 1, you cannot re-enter on day 2. Therefore, if you enter both the Colosseum and Forum/Palantine Hill on day 1, there is no going back for day 2. This is an important distinction that is not always clear.We did this on a tour, with a group called Italy With US, whom we found outside (did not plan tour ahead of time). I would definitely recommend taking a tour if you can. A tour will allow you to skip the lines, which can be very long. In addition, you'll also learn a lot more about the site, the ruins. On your own, it may not look like much or you won't know what you are looking at, other than a ruin of something that was once spectacular. You could easily spend 2+ hours just in the Forum/Palantine Hill. We did our tour and then lingered around on our own for a while (tour was 2 hours for Colosseum and Forum, did not include Palantine Hill). The ruins of the Forum recall the grand empire that once existed. The Palantine Hill was interesting, but to a much lesser degree in my opinion. Could be that we were just tired after a long day but the ruins were not nearly as impressive as the Forum, you had to use your imagination a lot more to envision what was once there. Lots of walking, lots of uneven ground. There is a spout or 2 to refill water bottles. Wear comfortable, sturdy shoes. This might be unpleasant in the extreme heat of summer - was ok in mid-late May when we visited, although we definitely got some sunburn."

My husband is very interested in Ancient Rome and we had both done a fair amount of reading up on the subject before making the trip in order to try to get the most out of it. The ruins are so special to see and include the Arch of Titus, the Arch of Septimus Severus, various basilicas, the House of the Vestal Virgins, the hut village where it is believed Romulus may have lived, Augustus' house...the list goes on!! We originally visited the ruins as part of a Colosseum tour but we felt we were far too rushed in the ruins so we went back on our own later. We are glad we did!! To see everything in the ruins and to look at it in the depth which we wanted to took about 6 hours. The ruins are quite confusing and it is easy to miss large parts, so I recommend making a whole day of it and taking a slow walk round so as to see as much as possible. If you're not all that clued up about Ancient Rome then I'd also recommend reading a short introduction or watching Mary Beard's Meet The Romans series before you go, as although the ruins do have signposts offering some explanation, they don't go into great depth.The ruins really make you feel as though you're closer to the history of a great Empire and brought the books we had read to life. There are some really beautiful things to see, not just the Arches and the remains of the Temples but also the Farnese Gardens with its beautiful flowers and orange trees.If you are wanting to visit Augustus' house then be aware that this is only open between I think 10am and 1pm as guides have to be present so that only a few people at a time can go in. The part of the house that is open is small, but worth a look if only to see the remains of the decoration on the walls and ceilings. It's quite modest compared to Nero's extravagance but interesting nonetheless!!All in all we really enjoyed our time at the Roman Forum and would certainly go back if we are in Rome again."

To rest against pillars and hear the stories, then wonder if in fact Caesar had also leaned against this same marble. I was in heaven to finally have the chance to experience this space after dreaming about witnessing it for my entire life."

Today I walked the streets, as a ancient Roman did, over 2000 years ago, the only difference is that the buildings I viewed were in ruins, and not in their luxurious condition way back then. As I walked the ancient street level, 10 meters lower than modern Rome's street level, it was very surreal to imagine chariots, being driven up and down the stone streets, carting the materials to construct these magnificent buildings, by hand and have stood the test of time, unlike todays buildings. Down side of the Forum area are:- the directional signage, once inside is very poor, - there are perhaps 2 toilet blocks (which are extremely dirty and unmaintained) for the while area, - there is no food available to purchase. There are only shady indian men sell water in some areas for \u20ac1- unless you hire a audio guide, paper maps are not provided. Tickets are \u20ac12.00 each and also include the Colosseum, which allows you to jump the very, very long queues at the Colosseum.Other than the few negatives, its a great outing to see Ancient Rome."

This place is situated by the Colosseum & is very easy to navigate through. As you walk through the many arches a path leads you onwards to this magnificent area with remnants of what would've been the meeting grounds of many important figures back in time. Standing within this area, you can feel transported back in time- with the strong roman foundations right through the ambience and smells. Make sure you explore this site- not to be missed."

The line to buy the pass at the Forum gate is very short and takes about 5 minutes. If you go to the coliseum first the line is exceptionally longer, everyone wants to see this first or this only possibly. You will save LOTS of time entering the Forum first, and then walking over to the coliseum after because you already have your ticket to get in. Both places are excellent. If you like the Forum and want to see more like this I would recommend going to Ostia Antica and going through the ruins there. These ruins are not as popular but you can take the metro busses the whole way there from the main station in Berlin (termini). At Ostia you can walk throughout the ruins and touch almost everything there. We were there for 3 hours walking and only saw half the city. I would recommend Ostia Antica to anyone who wants to really see an ancient city."

If you know a bit about the history and stories of what has taken place here, you can truly enjoy these sights that are still available for us to enjoy today! A little bit of money out of your wallet to step back to hundreds and hundreds of years ago- is well worth it in my opinion!

I would imagine that the most visited landmark in Rome is the Colosseum and it's easy to see why.It's a truly spectacular place, one that you have to see with your own eyes to appreciate the size, beauty and elegance of what the Romans did thousands of years ago. Photos can't really do it justice.My big tip is to get a Roma Pass or equivalent as the queues are huge, even during the 'quieter' periods. They can easily snake half way around the Colosseum and take hours to get inside. With a pre-paid ticket it took about 10 minutes. My other tip is to get an audio tour which really helped me to understand the history of the place, and just how brutal and bloody the battles that took place there were.Palatine Hill & Roman Forum: These are a collection of buildings, structures and gardens that sit opposite and around the Colosseum. Again, there's a huge slice of history found inside and they are well worth a visit."

It was my first time in a Rome and it is a struggle to take it all in. To get the most out of the Colosseum you need to give it about 3 hours. There are several levels and a really good museum section with various finds from not just Rome but other important digs.My mum uses a stick and found the lift really helpful. The staff were also helpful as we came in with directions.I don't have any Cons just tips. 1. Get your tickets in advance, they can be bought over the internet, this is what I did. They also get you into the Forum and Palatine hill. They can also be bought as a Roma Pass from loads of places around Rome. You skip the queues completely. Also check if you are entitled to a free ticket. My mum is 66 and she was just a 2 euro processing fee.2. If you have a buggy or a wheelchair or just can't do stairs there is a lift. As you come in just keep going forward on the ground floor, it's about 200ft along.3. If you want to go to the underground levels or the top level you must be on an authorised tour.4. Water. In the hotter months don't buy more than one bottle of water. There are drinking fountains all over Rome and they are free and the water is cold and delicious . There is one in the colosseum on the ground level.5. Only one set of toilets, they are in a portacabin on the ground floor and in summer are very busy and a bit smelly. You have been warned.6. Don't bother with the souvenir carts outside. I think they are the most expensive in the city. The ones just outside the Forum are much cheaper. Also outside the a Forum is the man who paints Watercolours. His small mounted pictures are only 5 euro and very lively.7. Watch out for the Roman Soldiers. They are great to get your picture with but you will need to pay."

The ticket you buy is valid for all three sites and I'd recommend you get your tickets from the Palantine Hill/Forum entrance as there was barely a queue there and the Coliseum had very long queues. Also do the Palantine Hill and Forum first and the Coliseum second as that site will be quieter in the afternoon. Take a bottle with you which you can refill at one of the many drinking water fountains in the Forum. Don't skip the Palantine Hill - it's worth walking all round all of it.

We brought tickets from an operator outside the colloseum for 20 euros which enabled us to jump the extremely long queue and join a guided tour. This tikets also gave us entry to the palantine hill and roman forum. The collaseum is vast and stunning but for me the roman forum and palantine hills were breath taking. In no other place then here did i really feel like i was in rome the real rome which conquered half the world thousands of years ago. The craftmanship of these people is so impressive and there really is nothing in todays age that can compete. Take the time to read the information posts which give you a real insight into exactly what purpose each structure held. Get ready to be amazed at what the final resting place of the great caeser is and how disapointing a structure is it given this mans legacy. Tip... Wear comfortable shoes. By comfortable i mean trainers the roman paths are a little worn and walking on them all day will take its toll."

For all these attractions, I highly recommend getting the Roma Pass Card (available online or at Tourist Information Points around the city) to get into the express entry lines for these attractions (versus waiting 30-60 mins in the general ticket & entry lines)."

The sights were inspiring and the guide gave lots of information and stories with a touch of humour. If you are flying from the UK it is cheaper to book these tours online before you go. Plenty of history and photos to take to remember these fantastic views and sights. Very busy with lots of commercialism outside of the sites but did not detract from the unique splendour and wonder of how these buildings were built. Some scaffolding around the Colosseum while it is being cleaned/preserved, but lots still to view. Well worth going inside the Colosseum as there is so much history and many artefacts still being dug up.The view from Palatine Hill is fantastic and a superb place to take photos of the surrounding ruins and buildings."

If you are into history as much as I am, you will be amazed at the grandeur of what was once the heart of the Roman Empire. Buy your tickets online in advance to avoid the lines. You can purchase 1 ticket that will cover all 3 sites. Start at the Forum, followed by Palatine, and the grand finale of Colosseum. You will need at least 4 hours, if you don't want to rush through it. Remember, that whether you go early in the morning, or in the afternoon, you will be surrounded by crowds, so don't even stress about the time. If you are planning on visiting in the summer, you will want to avoid going at noon, unless you enjoy 100 degree sun beating down on your head.And for those who like to dabble in photography-there are many wonderful opportunities for unbelievable pictures!"

The bottle can be refilled from the drinking fountains thru-out the site and the sandwich will come in handy by the time you reach the palatine hill in the late morning where you can find benches around the various gardens (there is no food service inside the venue). Enjoy a light lunch in the garden(s) and rest then proceed to the Colosseum.The Roma Pass is great for this because you will skip the ticket line at the Roman Forum and there is a dedicated (express entry) line at the Colosseum. The downside of the Roma Pass is that it does not include the 3rd ring and the underground at the Colosseum, nor the audio guide (maybe they will make this option available someday)."

The museums in the forum and on Paletine hill were closed for renovation (until Sept 14) which was a disappointment. The Colosseum was especially impressive."

Cheered by a bloodthirsty crowd Only 2% of them survived. After visiting the Colosseum, continue to the Palatine Hill and then to the Forum Romanum, in that order. Entrance where the Hop-On-Hop-Off buses stop. You\u00b4ll then hae a downhill walk to the Forum instead of a exhausting climb uphill the other way.I would recommend a at least a two day visit to cover it all (2-3 hours at each place) and yet you\u00b4ll only be skimming the history on the surface, but if you\u00b4re in Rome for 1-2 days, these are the places you just have to visit. The cues might seem endless when you get there, but they move quite fast. Don\u00b4t fall for the \"Fast line\" offer. \"Only 5 euro\" more. It\u00b4s not worth it. You will get inside anyway. Take your time to explore these fantastic historical monuments. Never to be built again. Senior citizens do have a reduced admittance fee. At least if you are living within the European Community. Do ask for it. They will probably not tell you, if you don\u00b4t. Do wear good walking shoes. It is not plain ground you will walk through. It\u00b4s cobblestone and stairs that sometimes almost wears you out. And when you leave the Forum there\u00b4s still more to discover outside the fence, walking towards the Victor Emanuelle II monument."

There is nothing I can add about the awe inspiring magnificence of the Colosseum but make sure you visit the Palatine hill and Roman Forum as well. If nothing else there are a couple of great vantage points for views over the city.We arrived at the Colosseum late morning and the queue was around 150m long. However the queue you see is only half the story as there is also 20-30 mins queuing inside the colosseum before you get to the ticket booth. I reckon the queue was probably in excess of an hour.We walked to the Palatine Hill entrance which was a couple of hundred metres down the street next to where all he buses park and got our ticket to the 3 attractions there. The queue was less than 5 minutes. If you walk up the Palatine hill then follow the paths to leave via the Roman Forum by following the Colosseum signs you will be opposite the Colosseum entrance. Simply walk through the middle of 3 lanes entering the Colosseum and have a smirk at the seemingly endless line of people queuing on your right hand side:-)"

To have built this structure to hold 80,000 people nearly 2000 years ago is an absolute marvel of engineering.

We decided to buy an audio guide to enhance our visit which we soon realised was a mistake. You had to walk across the site to reach point 1 and there were 38 points in total. The hire was for 2 hours and then they charged \u20ac5 per hour. After listening to the introduction and point 1 we realised we would never comfortably make it through all 38 points. We used it for about an hour but found it confusing as there were no signs marking the points at which to listen so you had to guess. We felt we weren't enjoying the site with the audio guide so we returned it and the pressure was off! A lot of the same information was on printed boards all over the site anyway so save your money and enjoy it at your own pace.There is enough to see here for practically a whole day if you want to read all the information signs and take it all in. If it's a hot day bring a hat and sun cream, there is shade to sit in but the main ruins are in the sun. There were plenty of clean toilets dotted over the site as well as lots of water fountains. Take a picnic with you (there's no refreshments to buy in the site) and spend a day amongst some fascinating Roman ruins."

The ticket is valid for 2 days and allows one entrance to the colosseum and one entrance to the forum-palatine. If you wish to see level three and underground in the colosseum it is a further 9 euros but I think you are taken on a tour for these areas and so you are allocated a time slot. Unfortunately these were all booked up so I missed out. It is therefore advisable to book for this in advance of your arrival direct with the colosseum.

You have to come prepared. We downloaded a Rick Steve's audio guide for the Forum. It helped us to picture what the ruins looked like in their heyday and also taught us a lot of history. We would have had no clue what we were looking at if it wasn't for the audio guide. On a similar note, we did not have any guide for the Palatine Hill portion, so many of the details were lost on us. The sights that were accompanied by the audio guide were far more enjoyable. Without the guide, we just saw artfully arranged rubble. Definitely bring some sort of guide to read or listen to. I think the site offered audio guides too, which could be purchased at the entrance for an additional fee. I cannot rate their guides since I did not know about this service at the time.The entrance fee pays for visits to the Colosseum, the Forum, and Palatine Hill. The Colosseum is just across the way with a separate entrance. The Forum and Hill can be reached through the same entrance since they are located adjacent to each other."

It's covered in holes where the marble was stripped off, some of which was used in the vatican. The colosseum sticks up, out of the surrounding modern city, like many of the historic sites in Rome. The work on the structure goes on, I would imagin keeping it up for future generations. Highly recommend."

The Arch of Titus,celebrating victories in Judea,to the Temple of Vesta,the Virgin;s abode and the Temple of Antoninus and Fausina,which survived in excellent fashion due to its re-birthing as the church of San Lorenzo.

This building has a gruesome history and it is worth paying a guide to take you through the area. The whole Roman Forum has much to see, more than one can take in on a single visit. Read up on these places before you visit to understand what you are viewing. The power and wealth of the Roman Empire, and the size of the population at the time of the construction of these buildings is amazing. Not to be missed."

Don't queue at the colosseum for your ticket - go the the ticket office on Palentine Hill - no queue and straight in and then when you are done walk straight into the Colloseum. If you want an audio guide you need photographic id with you (or passport) we didn't know this and didn't take it so couldn't get one. Fortunately I had downloaded a free podcast by Rick Steves. It's the best free-be I've ever had. Walked you round the forum explaining everything - just fab - saved us \u20ac10 so my other half was happy too."

The ambience, the temples, the ruins, the history was unmatched. We were really overwhelmed by the sheer size of the place and the feeling of history that envelopes you.It was like walking around ancient history and thinking about how the Romans used to live and move around in this place all those years ago. Having a great guide definitely added to the fun for us.Since our hotel was close to the Forum we came for evening walks along the Forum and saw it at dusk- was beautiful. Also, its great to climb up to the Capitoline Musei for a higher perspective on the Forum- very beautiful."

A piece of advice, even if you will go at off peak season like we did, an advance tickets in your hand will be very nice. LINES ARE LONG EVEN IN MARCH! Get your tickets. As for other places, I can't say, because this is the only tickets I bought for our tour aside from hop on hop off.

Not only because we got to skip the lines, but because we were with someone that could help us reconstruct the history that we were looking at. It was so much more meaningful. And the Palantine Hill--WOW! We didn't know much about this hill, other than it was a hill, before we came, and we were blown away as we were walking up it and seeing the size first hand. Reconstruct the history up there, and you'll be amazed. Also, on a sunny day, the view from up there can't be beat. Gorgeous!"

I could write for hours on this and it would not even begin to do the area and attractions justice.Top tips:Buy your entrance tickets at the forum ticket kiosk. The queues are 90% shorter than at the Colosseum.The same ticket includes The Colosseum, the forum and Palatine hillThe ticket is actually good for two days. So if you have time, do the Forum/Palatine hill one day (it really is a full day to do it any sort of justice) and the Colosseum the next.In my opinion, cramming everything into one day is too rushed and you loose (and even become a little blaze) a lot of the 'wow' effect."

The queues are shorter, waiting time (10am) was half an hour. You can buy a combined ticket for the Roman Forum/Coliseum. However, you CANNOT buy the underground tickets for the Coliseum at this site. Unless you have an excellent guide book, an audio guide would be useful as the site is poorly signposted (unlike GB) and there are only a few inadequate signs, that explain each area. We split this site and the Coliseum over 2 half days. The pathways are uneven so sensible shoes are a must. The site is extensive as you walk up to Palantine Hill and the gardens, which have good views of Rome."

On our first trip to Rome it was hard to know what to expect - so much of the iconic ancient architecture and the later monuments are famous worldwide. Would it be a disappointment? No, the classic ancient Roman Colosseum and Forum are truly awe-inspiring in their engineering perfection, but it was really sad to see so much of the best side of the Colosseum and several parts of the Forum shrouded in scaffold and sheeting. This review should be five stars but I can't give that in the current circumstances. That said, if the end result is better preservation and access for future visitors, we will just have to come again sometime.We can definitely endorse the recommendation for comfortable shoes and plenty of time, but even if you have to cram the sights into a short time a brief visit to these amazing monuments to ancient Roman civilisation is a must. Using the Roma Pass to bypass the queues and get around the city on public transport is good value - book it online at www.romapass.it and collect from a nominated Tourist Information Point."

We downloaded a Rick Steves audio guide onto our phone and bought our tickets from the booth on the Palatine entrance following a tip on Tripadvisor - no queues and booked an on-site guide for \u20ac5 each! The ticket is \u20ac12 for 2 days and just as well because you really need more than a few hours to get around the whole site.The Colosseum is an amazing feat of engineering and also quite emotive. It has a terrible but fascinating history. The groups of bored teenagers taking selfies are quite amusing...!The Forum is simply stunning. It's quite a small site in comparison to Ostia Antica or Pompeii but just as interesting. Palatine Hill is peaceful and beautiful and really worth spending a few hours wandering around.My main advice about tourism in Rome is not to believe the 'pay to jump-the-queue' information from the tour guides.We travelled in early April and didn't queue anywhere apart from a 25 min wait to get through security at St. Peter's. It will be different in July but when we went we arrived in mid/late morning, the tour groups were already in and there were no queues."

We loved touring thought the roman forum and learning first hand about the history . There are some sign posts but not many so it would be easy to not understand what you are seeing. The same applies to the colosseum - our guide had pictures so we could see what it would have been like.

Practicalities - toilets along the way but crowded in each place. Fresh water fountains are in all sites. No lines at Roman forum at 9:30 when we got there. Long lines at Colosseum.

When you get to the ticket office it is a bun fight to get one , no system in place so get your elbows ready. There was no build up, no music or sound effects whilst waiting and nothing to read. No imagination at all !! The Colosseum fortunately sells itself and is still worth a visit. We really enjoyed the Palatine as it was less crowded. Our overall feeling about all the sights is that they lack any imagination at all, signs are very basic so take a good guide book to help you.

We did this in April and it was quite hot., All waiting in line skipped. Would hate to do this in mid summer. There is too much to take in with the temperature too high. Our guide was David who got the blend of knowledge and comedy just right. Could have spent a lot longer here had i been doing this on my own but would never have got all the info."

Both visits are necessary if you go to Roma, but if you have the \"bad\" luck of going during the weekend, at least the Colosseum is crowded of people and you can't enjoy it as it deserves. So if you go during the weekend it's better to do the effort of going soon in the morning, in order to avoid the rush hours. The Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum are less crowded, but when we went they were full of scaffoldings and it makes them to lose part of their beauty, but if you have some imagination you can feel like if you were living in the ancient Rome and it's a very nice visit and experience. For this places be careful with the entering time because the last entrance finish earlier than the Colosseum one (at 15:45 I guess) so it's easy to arrive and find it closed. I highly recommend you to buy the tickets through the internet in advance, because you pay the same and you avoid queues, and you can use it during 2 or 3 days since the first usage."

Vertical earthquake struck columns where absorbing me in them. It looks like its just a walk through but when you take steps down your eyes revolve around 360 degree to see the destruction of mighty power of the world in their times. Every stone speaks and tell what all these years they have seen, glory to destruction.Be careful while walking as it's really uneven and there should be water with you oh hot day and umbrella for unpredictable shower.Once you enter to the site, you have two options. Either go left to Palatine Hill or go straight to walk through forum and on right ruined temples. When you reach at the end under the marble pillars and Septimius Severus Arch, the view is awesome, specially when sun is setting down on your right.I would suggest to make your own marks with sunlight and take good shades, if you are keen photographer. You will be amazed with colours and angles you will achieve.You can exit on right half way through or at the end on right side - both bit steep upwards.Once you are out of site, there is no way in...as usual.Good luck.Contact at kqureshie@outlook.com if any questions still unanswered."

Even in spring the sun beats down and there is little shade;It is easy to spend most of a day exploring just these three sites if you have the time;Unless you want to pay for the privilege do not have your photo taken with ther 'Roman soldiers' that lurk around these and other attractions.

Between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Roman Forum was the commercial, political, religious and social centre of ancient Rome. This centre of public life would have been an impressive hub which housed the most important public buildings, temples and arches. Today there are extensive ruins and with some imagination, as you stand on the original paving stones that lined the road, placing footsteps where ancient Romans went about their business, this scattering of ruins begin to come alive. Having a guide also helped bring the ruins to life.We booked a small tour through Viator \u201cSmall-Group Ancient Rome and Colosseum Tour: Underground Chambers, Arena and Upper Tier\u201d which included walking through the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill before going to the Colosseum. Our English speaking guide was very knowledgeable and we found it was a great way to see some of the main sites before going to the Colosseum. We definitely benefited from visiting these sites with a guide and would recommend, especially as there is not a lot of information at the site itself. In total our tour was around three and a half hours.There are some well preserved ruins remaining at the Forum, including the Arch of Septimius Severus and the Arch of Titus, the House of the Vestals and several temples, such as Temple of Antoninus and Faustina and the Temple of Romulus.Also a highlight on the Palatine Hill is the Neronian Cryptoporticus which is an underground corridor, 130 metres long.There is quite a lot of walking which we found enjoyable. Would recommend wearing comfortable shoes and a hat if sunny, also bring sunscreen. It did get quite warm and we were grateful that we had taken our own water with us."

It certainly helped avoid the long queues at the Colosseum but we came unstuck by then going to the Palantine - we asked the man on the gate if we would be able to use the ticket at the Palatine the next day if we hadn't seen all the sights. We were told we could. We saw all we needed but on the hill but needed to still see the Roman Forum the next day. The next day we tried to use our 48 hour ticket at the Fourm but were told we couldn't use the ticket because we had used it the day before. Apparently although the ticket is for 48 hours you have to visit the Colosseum on one day and the other two sights on the same day. This was not explained clearly when buying tickets so we ended up having to pay twice."

When we had spent a couple of hours walking around we carried on to the Roman Forum. The ticket office there had no queues at all... The tickets are valid for 2 days so we saw the fantastic Colosseum the next day.. As we had a valid ticket we were able to walk past the long queues. I would recommend having a guide.

We pored over the excavations and wandered up and down the Palatine and Capitoline Hills. Also visited the Church of Saint Bonaventure. Amazing to walk in the footsteps of the Roman emperors, their wives and people around them. The Colosseum was amazing also, to see such architecture and workmanship was out of this world.

For many hundreds of years it was the administrative capital of the world's first true empire. The senate of the Roman Republic ruled from here and victorious generals from Marius to Julius Caesar brought their triumphant armies, loot and captured enemies down the Via Sacra. The site is in ruins and those ruins are largely of a later era and yet the resonances of history and the site's importance are still strong here. If you wish to understand the site you will need an audio guide or a guided tour as the site is jumbled and confusing. Even without a guide the site is awesome. I believe I read somewhere that it is the largest open air museum in the world. So my tip is, whether or not you choose the guided tour, bring plenty  water and food, take plenty of time and soak up the experience of being in one of the world's unique historic settings."

Looking at the bone doesn't provide me with a ton of enjoyment.

There's a lot of info and even maps of the Forum online, so a guide or audio guide aren't necessary. Be careful and watch where you're walking since the ground is very uneven with loose stones. The cobblestones are varying heights and widths, so just watch and stop often rather than trying to walk and look. I've learned after falling in Chicago and in Paris that I can only do one thing at a time. We were sure we'd enjoy the Forum, but it's even more wonderful than expected. It was so moving to be where so much history took place. When I read Shakespeare in high school, little did I know I'd stand in the Forum one day. Goosebumps! With centuries of history and neglect until the 1900's, it's being restored to the late Roman Empire period. I've seen travel photos of the Forum packed with people. I'm telling you, fellow advisors, go in April!"

We had walked the forum a few years ago with a tour company called, Rome Walks, and had an outstanding experience. This time the experience was good in a slightly different way. First, a set of stairs has been built to the church that is built on part of the forum. Second, you could no longer walk out beneath the arch and instead go out through an elaborate gate mechanism to insure people pay to enter the ruins. Presume this is all part of efforts to stabilize these monuments and ruins. But instead of dwelling on what was a few years ago, the focus should be to what was during Rome's glory days - the Senate, where the great debates of the day occurred, the home of the Vestal Virgins, the place where Caesar was killed and where his funeral occurred. Also, you look up from the pit of the forum and realize how ancient Rome was buried under dirt and rubble and later incarnations of the city were sequentially built on top of the old city. The old ornate marble was stripped off and the underlying stone work, too heavy to move, was just buried. If you take it from the perspective of conserving resources and recycling what could be saved, we find that many ancient civilizations were doing what we are trying to encourage today - reuse, repurpose, renew...."

We went on our own at the Colosseum, and the same with this, relying on our smartphone for the information.So much history starting in Palatine Hill, from the legend of Romulus and Remus, to Caesar Augustus and emperors after him, it felt surreal knowing they were right here! There are the ruins of the palace, its stadium, a Palatino museum and also remains of the residences of Augustus and Livia.The ruins of the Forum were amazing, especially the well-preserved monuments still standing. Was in awe of what it would have been like in its glorious history. Much more crowded here than the Palatine. The only downside is it would be very helpful to have signs with more description of each of the ruin for paying visitors."

It is truly a spectacular site completely full of history and to have buildings so well preserved from such a well known period is spectacular. There are restoration works taking place but they do not distract the visitor from this site. It is handy to either know something about the layout or to have a mini guide or booklet as whilst there are signs and display boards to help the visitor a little knowledge will help you appreciate the site a lot more.The site is mainly built on a hill with uneven pathways but there are plenty of places to rest and of course there is the Roman natural drinking water fountain available on this site. It really is an amazing place to visit and truly captivated my family"

The forum and Palatine is both fascinating and frustrating lots of unique structures particularly the two triumphal arches and on the Palatine some of the remains are really impressive but the place does seem to resemble a bit of a Roman junk yard with limited interpretation confusing path ways and some clearly very important monuments having no details or explanation. I suspect those on a guided tour had a much better time but on this occasion I was not able to do that so as a solo visitor it was not so good. Having said that the frequent water fountains are a real boon. Finally it gets hideously busy as the day goes on so get there early"

Our guide was Mr. Guido Airoldi, who was an outstanding tour guide. Guido's English was perfect and his delivery style was very engaging. He was thoroughly knowledgeable about all aspects of ancient rome and its people. Touring the Colosseum, including the underground chambers and third seating tier, was on my bucket list and Mr. Airoldi made this tour even more special for me. I highly recommend this particular tour and I certainly recommend Mr. Guido Airoldi as an excellent tour guide. You will not be disappointed with this tour."

It was worth it to be able to walk up close to the ruins and capture all the details with photographs. We did have a quide, but I actually learned more from a picture book that I had purchased called \"Rome Reconstructed\". It came in very handy when trying to figure out the structures that the ruins came from. It's basically a book that shows you the before (what it looked like in Roman times) and after pictures so you can visualize how it all comes together. Just don't buy it in Rome. It's much more expensive than getting it online through Amazon. Whether you have a guide or not, it's well worth a visit even with the difficulties of trying to put all the pieces together.The most interesting structure to me was the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It was converted into a Roman Catholic church in the 7th century and went through many reconstructions since that time. The church is now called San Lorenzo in Miranda. It is more known for being the \"church in a temple\". It's interesting because it was converted around the same time as the Pantheon."

For a short time this year, the official Colosseum/Roman Forum ticket operator, http://www.coopculture.it , was offering night tours of the Roman Forum -- la luna sul foro romano (August 9 - October 25, 2013). We had an English language tour at 8:30 p.m. (meet at the Roman Forum ticket counter side entrance, off of Via dei Fori Imperiali). We had an excellent guide, Michele, who was extremely knowledgeable and entertaining to both the adults as well as the children on the small tour (less than 20 people). We toured the Basilica Amelia, the Curia (we were able to go inside), see the Arch of Septimius Severus and Temple of Saturn, the Temples of Castor and Pollux and Vestal, the Temple of the Divine Caesar, the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, the Basilica of Maxentius, the Arch of Titus, and the Temples of Rome and Venus. The tour took about 1 1/2 hours and moved at a very good pace (although I would have loved more time in the Curia). Michele provided the right amount of information, easily providing more detail when one of the group had a particular interest. Touring the Roman Forum in the quiet of night was wonderful, and seeing the temples lit up was magical. If they are offering this tour -- book it (particularly if you have already seen the Roman Forum during the day). One caveat: the Via Sacra and paths are difficult enough during the day, much less at night. Wear sensible shoes and bring a small flashlight (we used the flashlight app on our iPhone) can really help."

Unfortunately for us, (this was our last day in Rome before flying home) we arrived at the Colosseum to use our ticket, along with many many other people, at 5.30pm (on the board advising times of opening and closing times it said the Colosseum closed at 6.30pm). Fortunately I can speak reasonable Italian and when I spoke to the attendant he rudely told me that it was now closed, when I challenged him on the closing time he told me he was going home!There was a very large group of very disappointed people standing there. They spoke English so I informed them what was said to me. The point of this review is to let you know that firstly if you are a member of the EU then you can get in for free and secondly, don't leave it too late to visit the Colosseum or else you will be very disappointed when you can't get in.

The Colosseum is the poster child for ancient Rome, and a must-see attraction (especially the Underground Tour), but there is way more history and context in the Roman Forum (or Fora Romano). I spent several hours wandering and studying these ruins, aided enormously by the much-improved signage throughout the area. I was not able to locate an English-language guide, but had planned ahead for that and brought Rick Steves' small, paperback \"Rome\" book, which has an EXCELLENT self-guided tour of the place. You can also download his free audio tour on iTunes. I combined this material with some pre-trip reading about the site and was able to get an awful lot out of it just walking on my own. I also cheated now and then and caught a few words from some of the tour guides leading groups through the area, but I also heard some of them giving out some incorrect info. Nonetheless, if you're totally new to the Forum, you should consider a guide.One thing to bear in mind is that this area evolved and changed many times over the centuries, so you are not looking at a place that once stood, intact, at a specific moment in time. Think of how much Washington, D.C., or other major capitals have changed over the centuries and you will understand that these ruins are from buildings that existed hundreds of years apart. An example is the difference in age between the Arch of Titus and the larger Arch of Constantine, which were build hundreds of years apart and represented quite different events. Similarly, the Temple of Julius Caesar should be juxtaposed with the much younger (and vastly larger) Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine, which is nearby. The Temple of Caesar, where the assassinated dictator was cremated, is yet another site that lends context.I was disappointed that part of the west end of the Forum was blocked off due to construction and that the Curia building was closed. This is one of the few buildings that remains somewhat intact and once housed the Roman Senate. I was thankful that a worker allowed me to cross the line just long enough to take some pictures of the building, but would like to have seen the inside.If you are not at all interested in history, or perhaps bored by it, this may not be for you. However, if you have purchased a ticket to enter the Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine, you should at least stroll around the place and get a feel for all the history that unfolded here and all of the great historical figures who actually walked here.I did not visit the Palatine this time, but did tour it in 2009. It is interesting, but I found very little in the way of recognizable ruins compared to the Forum. Nonetheless, the same rule applies; if you bought the ticket and you have the time, give it a view.Be sure to remember that your admission ticket only gives you ONE admission to each of these sites. Once you leave, you cannot reenter without buying another ticket, so make the most of your time there."

If you want to get the most historical perspective out of it strongly consider getting a tour guide or bring a book that shows what the buildings looked like in the past. Otherwise your imagination will have a hard time reconstructing the piles of rocks. Takes an hour or two to walk around the whole forum and see all the ruins, but you could easily spend half a day there if you wanted to study everything. Bring bottles of water (which you can refill with fountain water on the forum trail), and plenty of sunscreen because there is little shade. We had heard and found it to be true that the Forum ticket line is the best place to buy Colosseum tickets. We got there around 1 pm and there was zero line to get in. Our ticket was good for the colosseum which we went to immediately afterwards. There was a huge line to buy entry tix there so definitely head to the forum!"

For people who dont know very much (except the basics) of Ancient Rome, it is worth getting a guided tour so that you can understand and appreciate the history of the area and know what you are looking at. It is so vast that if you dont have a wide knowledge of the era, a lot of it will be lost on you, and that is just a shame. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as the roads are uneven and cobbled. There are water fountains dotted around to refill water bottles, a lot of water will be needed on a warm day, its a long walk. It is also worth paying a visit at night to see it all lit up. The atmosphere is totally different when there are no people wandering around the ancient ruins. I would suggested doing the Colosseum and the Forum in the same day as they right net to each other, but they will take most of the day to see properly.

We spent much of the time moving our cumbersome group about (40 of us?), oftentimes the headphones didn't work.

I was there about 6 days ago and I was able to skip the lines by going at 4:30pm - cooler, no lines, 12E to get in at the gates, and not huge crowds inside. The entrance fee includes the Colosseum, can be bought at any of the three site entrances (Forum, Palatine, Colosseum), and includes entry for 2 days. Buy at the Forum entrance for smallest lines, and then walk right into the Colosseum. They let you into the sites until 6pm at this time of the year, and clear everyone out by 7pm. So if you wanted to do both, begin with one site (Forum and Palatine are together - if you enter at the Forum, you are walking towards the Colosseum), and then make sure you are into the second site (Colosseum) before the 6pm cut off...and you will still have an hour to explore. Going later also makes for better photos with softer light, less people, and the bonus of finishing the Colosseum just as its getting close to sunset. Grab a gelato nearby and stick around to view the Colosseum at night! Take a water bottle (which you can refill at a cold fountain inside the site) and a sun hat/ umbrella as there is limited shade."

Best time to visit is early in the morning (we came at 9 AM in August). We chose to have a private tour guide through Rome Illuminated, which greatly enhanced our visit. Other visitors have recommended downloading an audio guide by Rick Steves through his website. Because the buildings are very incomplete, a guide is integral to your entertainment and education; otherwise the are just picturesque fields of broken stone. The Forum represents the heart of ancient Rome, where criminal trials, great speeches, worship, financial transactions, shopping and negotiations took place. It was Washington, D.C., New York, Las Vegas, Tokyo, and the Vatican rolled into one. A place to see and be seen. A mixture of the holy, the wealthy, the beautiful, the poor, and the every day. Triumphant legions marched down the paved Via Sacra, on the same stones you find there today. Slaves built the temples. Massive stone arches celebrated military victories, including the arch of Severus Septimius celebrating his victory over Jerusalem (note the soldiers bearing away the menorah). Fresh water was delivered via tiered aqueducts which could deliver water to all levels on the Palatine hills. Waste and rain were carried away by a sophisticated underground sewage system (which can still be seen through the stones). Vaulted arches, architectural and mathematical wonders, supported incredibly large palaces and temples. This book will enliven your imagination of what it used to look like: http://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Rome-Monuments-Past-Present/dp/8881620308/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_1There are water fountains to refill your bottles outside the Colosseum. There are actually some shaded areas inside the Forum and some areas where you can sit on the fallen columns/ rocks. We did not climb the Palatine Hills as most of the buildings were concentrated in the Forum. The most important thing to remember is to plan before your visit, to get the most out of it. There is a nice gelateria to reward yourself on the street opposite the Colosseum, on the left side of the street, just on the street corner. Because of the unevenness and the number of small hills, strollers and wheelchairs will have difficulty."

Very few places shaped world history more than the Roman forum (the heart of the Roman Republic). A visit is a must if you are interested in history at all. If you are not well versed in Roman history, I would highly recommend spending 2 or 3 hours reading about the role of the Roman forum in Roman society before visiting the site. It will really enhance your visit. I would also recommend spending 10 euro on a book like Rome Past and Present which includes photos of the ruins today and overlays/reconstructions of what the actual temples and buildings may have looked like during Roman times. The reconstructions really help you imagine what the forum looked like in its hay day (the book is available at the many newstands located around the Colosseum). If the forum is of particular interest to you, I highly recommend spending a few extra dollars and getting your own tour guide. The guides (who must be certified after substantial studies in ancient history) are full of knowledge that really makes the tour.Tip: Wear comfortable shoes as the uneven pavement is punishing on the feet; wear a hat there is very little shade and it can get very hot in the summer. Bring a water bottle as there are water fountains throughout Palentine Hill and the forum where you can fill up."

Many TA reviewers reported that the wait was much shorter here. However, what appeared to be a much shorter line was incredibly slow moving. It still took us 45 minutes of waiting in the hot sun to get in. Once we got in, though, we found the Forum to be much more interesting than expected - so much so that we spent a couple of hours exploring and decided to use our tickets for the Colosseum the next day (they are good for one entry to each site within two days).What we found particularly interesting was being able to see a large complex of buildings and streets, walking along the same paths of long ago, and visualizing what life must have been like back then. Many of the buildings are more intact than we expected, though you cannot enter them. Plan on doing a lot of walking. Comfortable shoes are a must!We got the audio guide and accompanying map, but the quality of the content (and of the sound quality) was not that great (e.g., compared to what we got at the Vatican Museums). On top of that, the physical signs scattered around the complex had different station numbers from the map. That confused the heck out of us until we realized that they didn't match up and then used only the map. There are also multiple entrances to the Forum, so make sure you have your correct bearings by clearly finding the entrance you came in through on the map.Overall, we enjoyed our visit. Given the poor quality of the audio guide, it may have been better to pay for a live tour. But make sure you get something. Walking around without any guidance whatsoever - live or audio guide, detailed tour book - would leave much to be appreciated.One word of caution: there is a cave-like spot with some statues along the wall and where water is dripping from above into a small pool. We took shelter there because it was so hot and sat for a few minutes. But BEWARE of stopping there. In those few minutes, three out of four of us got a large number of insect bites."

We did the forum ruins etc in the same day as the Colosseum - your ticket for the Colosseum actually allows you access to the Forum and Palatine Hill area for two days - there is do much to take in that its probably a good idea to break them up - we did it all in one day and by the end of it we were looking at fantastic ancient ruins like second hand cars. Buy bottles of frozen water and take in with you - there are plenty of free drinking water fountains inside to top the bottles up. Hat and sunscreen are a must."

So we had to line up in the hot sun for at least 30 minutes to buy our forum tickets. We discussed whether we needed an electronic information guide and decided we should pay the extra, both for the forum and the Palatine Hill. After finally getting the guide working, we found that the map and guide combined were very difficult to follow .... finally realising that this was at least partly due to sections that were closed and the guide and map not being updated... Then the guide was only hired out for two hours, anything more and there's a fine. We definitely hadn't finished the whole amazing site in two hours, so I had to run back with the guide and negotiate the crowds at the gate again. A confusing experience, but well worth the amazing sites. And there probably is enough information to go without the guide... As someone else said, just research it earlier."

I photocopied the appropriate pages and took that with us instead of the whole book, saving space and weight in our luggage. It was worth every penny and every minute spent preparing. The guide was essential to knowing exactly what we were looking at. NONE of the monuments would have meant even half of what it meant, without the explanation. For example, I never would have noticed the final resting place of Caesar, since it was behind a low wall and very unobtrusive. The fresh flowers laid there were very poetic though. The main thoroughfare, the Via Sacra, led us to walk the same steps as those of the ancient rulers of Rome. The triumphal arches were intricate and beautiful, and steeped with history. There were several restored buildings, including the Curia Julia, which was the meeting place of the Senate. There was an exhibit of WWII propaganda art inside of the lovely Temple of Romulus. My favorite location was Nero's somewhat restored rotating dining room overlooking the Colosseum. The view was spectacular and the idea of a rotating dining room that ancient was mind boggling.We visited in January. It was lightly drizzling but the rain was well worth the lack of a crowd. We had the place to ourselves completely for our full three hour stay. The fee (15.5 euro) got us into the Forum, Palatine Hill, and the Colosseum. Well worth the money. So much to see! Prepare to spend a while walking this wonderful site. Note: Avoid the small museum located at the top of the hill. It was not worth the effort, especially when you can go to the Musei Capitolini which is worlds better."

You can also see a lot of hidden gems, like the Temple of Romulus (the son of an emperor, not one of the two founder of Rome) the altar where the body of Jules Cesar was burnt and the temple of the Vestal Virgins.

I was saddened at the sight of it. A square so rich in history yet so ignored by modern day Italians. I say Italians and not Romans because the Romans were very organized people if anything and modern day Italians in Rome just don't seem that way at all.There are almost no signs telling you where you'd find what. There are no translations to what maybe ancient Italian or Italian. Nothing. You could almost miss Caesar's funeral pyre. In fact many tourists did. Everyone just walked by it because nobody knew what it was. You'd think that maybe they did not want to destroy the site by littering it with signs etc but think again. Everything you see has been tempered with. The pavements are not from the ancient times at least not for the most of it. It is nothing more than ruins of a once grand ancient empire. If you studied Roman history you would be sad to see it the way it is.Everything is about money. The ticket for the Roman Forum is the same 2 day ticket for the Colloseo. However, do not think you can visit the Colloseo twice although it says 2 day ticket. What it really means is, it is valid for 2 entries. We thought we could do the Colloseo the first day, the Roman Forum the next day and go back to the gift shop in the Colloseo the 2nd day to buy some souvenirs. We were not allowed to. When I told her (the girl at the entry) it doesn't say that anywhere that it is valid only for 2 entries, she just shrugged and started talking to her friend. Also the Roman Forum is not handicap friendly and neither is the Colloseo. I do believe, if they can build a souvenir shop in the Colloseo and there are even 2 rooms which were offices then they can somehow make a ramp or an elevator for the handicap.If you visit the Circus Maximus anytime soon, you'd know what I mean with disastrously maintained. A Spanish couple who were sitting on the edge of it, asked us if we knew where it was as we passed by. I just laughed and told them why of course you're sitting in it. She refused to believe me until I showed her the ring and the ruins of it on the other end.If you expect less than you'll appreciate more I guess."

The ruins at the Forum are closer together compared to those at Palatine Hill so it is easier to navigate but still requires a lot of walking.For those who would rather see but not walk among the ancient ruins, the 3rd level of the Colosseo provides a striking view of the Arch of Constantine with the east side of the Forum (Arch of Titus and Temple of Venus and Rome) completing the picture. However, the more stunning panorama would be from Il Vittoriano's terrazza where one can almost see the entire north-northeast side (from the top of the Arch of Septimius Severus extending all the way to the Arch of Titus) as well as the Colosseo and the Arch of Constantine.

I have little to add to the many prior reviews of the Roman Forum other than to mention the \u201cofficial\u201d guided tour of the Forum, which seems to receive very little publicity. The Italian cultural ministry (MiBAC), which is responsible for the Roman Forum, offers guided tours in Italian and English (and possibly other languages as well) several times a day. We were able to include an English-language tour during our recent visit and thought it was excellent. Our personable and enthusiastic guide explained that the tour is scheduled to run for one hour, but that she usually runs longer because she has \"so much to share.\" In fact, our tour was about an hour and a half. Although she spoke rapidly (more of \u201cso much to share!\u201d), she was very easy to understand. Our group of 18-20 visitors walked with her to a number of the major sites in the Forum; she helped us to understand the function of each, how it would have looked long ago, and how the various sites fit together on the Forum\u2019s complicated timeline. We thought she was very knowledgeable. The guide was happy to answer questions throughout the tour, and at its conclusion, offered individualized suggestions for what we should do next based on what we had already seen of ancient Rome.Tickets for this tour are available only at the Forum. It cannot be booked ahead by telephone or online (at least I was told this wasn\u2019t possible). The \u201cofficial\u201d website for purchasing entry tickets mentions these tours, but the times listed did not correspond to the times offered on the day we visited. At the Forum, I found only a tiny sign with information about the tours and learned more by asking the person stationed at the entry gate. Guided tour tickets (as well as audioguides) can be obtained at the ticket window in a separate line from the one for the purchase of entry tickets. At a cost of \u20ac5 per adult, this tour may be the best value in Rome!Note that the cultural ministry also offers guided tours of Palatine Hill, but unfortunately for us, the times conflicted with our Forum tour.I recommend a visit to the Roman Forum and in particular recommend taking the informative \u201cofficial\u201d guided tour.

Some of the remaining pillars give one an idea of just how grand and epic the place would have been. A few extant ruins are wonderfully intricate and detailed. Unsurprisingly, given the 2000 year interim, there is also a lot that is simply rubble, and it is sometimes hard to picture in its heyday. There were also no explanatory signs, so it is difficult to learn about the ruins you\u2019re staring at, and gain much context. This was frustrating.

We decided to skip the Colosseum as the lines were long and we had been there before, and bought our ticket at the entrance to the Forums instead (in hindsight, you could probably buy your combination ticket at the Forums and then take the quicker, already-have-your-ticket entrance into the Colosseum, but I can't say that for sure as we didn't try it ourselves). The entrance to the Forums is on the East side of the complex, on the road that goes south from the Colosseum. Not the most obvious place but they do have some signage indicating where to go. There was virtually no line and once you're in the park, it is really quite spacious. No signage of any kind though, so if you want to also understand what you're looking at, you will have to get the audio tour in addition to the entrance ticket.

The ruins are absolutely amazing. I'm a huge fan of ancient architecture so i really enjoyed walking around looking at the remnants of the government buildings . It is so wonderful to see a part of history that is so ancient. Its pretty unbelievable.. the carving detail on the monuments are stunning. I could have taken thousands of pictures. From the top of the hill you get a great view of Rome, just be sure you wear comfortable shoes because the ground is uneven and rocky. We didn't go with a guide here like we did at the colosseum and chose to just look around ourselves with a map."

So entering it from the hill we missed the queues. It was really interesting. It bought it alive. You could imagine yourself walking with the senators. I couldn't get over how close everything was together. When the buildings were at full height they must have been very imposing. Our children (8 & 10 yrs) also enjoyed it. They had looked at the romana at school so enjoyed being there. We spent a couple of hours there. I could have spent longer but that was enough for the children."

Imagine for a moment a triumphal procession just like in the movies moving through the Arch of Titus and progressing down the Via Sacra toward the Rostra across from the Basilica Julia. The bases where triumphal columns once stood are still there and the paving stones are the same that some of the greatest names in Roman history once trod. The garden in the House of the Vestal Virgins still has roses blooming by its two small pools of water, and the three lonely columns from the Temple of Castor and Pollux stand sentinel over its remains. Step towards the Arch of Septimus Severus. This is at the far end by an exit that leads to the Victor Emmanuel Monument. Look at the tremendous relief work in this arch. Take your guide book and walk around the site and take the time to explore. You can easily figure out where the Basilica Julia was located (the bathrooms are behind this ruin), and directly across the forum is the what's left of the Basilica Amelia where money exchange and commercial transactions took place. And the circular Temple of Vesta is another easily recognizable monument. Some locations are more difficult to imagine, such as the Basilica of Constantine and Maxeritius. The only thing that remains here are three huge vaults and some pavement that give a suggestion of how huge this building once was.Like any ancient ruins, the remains of the Forum suffered centuries of earthquakes and neglect, but they are part of the fabric of history and help to weave a story of what Ancient Rome must have been like. Take time to explore and to imagine the Glory of the Ancient Rome beneath your feet! You won't be sorry. And for those who aren't good on their feet, bear in mind that the terrain is rough and that the walking isn't easy. Remember that your combination ticket includes the Colosseum and the Palatine Hill. Enjoy!"

The building speaks for itself, you cannot miss it.Cue was massive cost was 12euros each, we went for an english speaking guide who presented himself to us near the entrance. The cost was 30euros each we were given a yellow sticker dot and told to wait. The tour started off with a lady who explained some history of the Col we then skipped the cues and went inside. There are plenty of clean and free fountains around both sites so take a bottle, it gets very hot in both sites you will need it as you cannot buy water inside the sites. The first part of the tour lasted approx an hour and the group was of around 25 people, there seemed to be no signs or explanations around the buliding so the tour was essentially the only source of information. We had the first 1 hour with this lady and was then given 45mins of our own time, we then met a man for the second half of the tour to Palantine hill we walked around the old palace grounds and were shown from a vantage point the main points of the Forum. this lasted approx another hour. Although the site speaks for itself I felt that it needed some TLC as weeds were growing around the exhibit and there ws a lack of visual aids to help imagine what the exhibits would have looked like in their splendour. We basically wandered around the Forum not knowing a Column from a Colonade :-) I just think that the expirience could be a lot more polished (I know its not Disneyland but the Italians could make a bit of an effort)."

You can walk among the ruins of ancient Rome and read detailed descriptions in multiple languages of the history of each building, column, or other structure. It's fascinating to be able to stroll among the actual ruins of the Roman Senate, the triumphal arch of Titus, and much more.You'll do a bit of walking on uneven cobblestone paths and rough walkways, plus up and down stairs, so if anyone in your group has serious mobility problems, you may want to think carefully about going in. That said, as a 60+ male with two bad knees, I had no problem getting around.In my opinion, there's no reason to bother paying for the audio tour. I rented it for both walks (there is a separate audio sequence for the Forum and for the Palatine.) Half of the narrations didn't work and the other half, while informative and interesting, actually went on too long. Because there are numerous explanatory signs, you'll be able to get the gist of the story without the audio tracks.Note that admission to the Forum does not get you admission to the Coliseum.

So, sit back, take your time, try to rule out the tourists and envision what it might have looked like when the emperor returned from his victorious battles or the orators made their speeches, or even when Julius Caesar was stabbed to death. You should put aside a few hours (at least two, in my opinion) to fully experience the splendid Forum. And it goes without saying that you need comfortable shoes! A combo ticket (Forum, Colosseum, Palatine) was 12 Euros, and definitely worth the cost. You can buy the tickets online so you don't have to wait in line in front of the ticket office. Also, go for the entrance along Via dei Fori Imperiali, as it seems to be much less crowded than the entrance outside Colosseum. There were surprisingly few signposts inside the Forum, so you should bring a good guidebook or buy an audioguide at the entrance.

There are however, some stunning views from the Hill. The Forum was far more interesting but again better signage and explanations would go a long way in improving the site - I doubt this is going to happen anytime soon, so make sure you have a good guidebook with you! I love Ancient Rome so just being at the Forum was exciting but the whole experience could be quite underwhelming for those without a keen interest or a guide to bring the place to life.The cost of the ticket is quite hefty so if you are on a tight budget and just want a great photo without paying for it then you are in luck - the best vantage point of the Forum is totally free!

We took a guided tour of the Colloseum (which I would highly recommend - much more meaningful than walking around on your own) and an optional guided tour of the Forum came with it. It is so fascinating to walk around all those ruins from 2000 years ago. I disagree with the person who suggested to just view the area from outside. Although that is an option, there is just nothing like getting up close to the ruins to experience the culture that is all things Roman."

Without a guide, or some very good books, you lose learning about the artifacts, the history, the meaning, and the culture of the people who worked and lived among these ruins. Added bonus of hiring a guide; they will pre-arrange tickets for you so you don't have to wait in line to enter. The Forum gets very crowded and skipping the line makes for a much more enjoyable experience. The Forum was the heart and soul of Ancient Rome and shouldn't be missed."

Yes, the history is amazing and if you can imagine what it must have been like 2000 years ago it's truly special. However, that's the problem. What you see is a lot of rubble and remnants of destroyed and vandalized buildings and consequently it makes it almost impossible to actually use your imagination. I especially liked the arches of Constantine, Titus and Septimius Severus. They are in great condition and much of their detail is still visible. Walking along the Via Sacra (the main street of ancient Rome) is guaranteed to give you goose bumps as you consider the many great Emperors who tread on the very flagstone your feet are touching. You have to see it and experience it. Please don't miss it! Nonetheless, seeing is believing and sadly there's not much left to see."

To enjoy a trip to the Roman Forum (especially during a warm clear day), you need the following: (1) a Roma Pass (to get in for free and to avoid the long queues); (2) a bottle of water; (3) a hat; (4) imagination; and (5) patience.Before you rush into the Forum, try to appreciate it from a distance at different angles. I recommend the view from the Capitoline Hill behind the Piazza del Campidoglio. From that vantage point you can see the western end of the Forum which has the Arch of Septimus Severus and the Temple of Saturn, among others. In the early morning sunlight, it is an impressive sight even in its ruined state. Then go around and then go near the Forum by way of the Mamertine Prison and Ss. Luca e Martina to get a closer view of the Arch of Septimius Severus.You can then enter the Forum at the entrance near the ruins of the Forum of Nerva. Make sure to check out the labels on the free-standing columns and structures to at least get your bearings in this vast complex. Just follow the Via Sacra, the main road inside the Forum, where one end gets you to the Arch of Septimus Severus and the other end gets you to the Arch of Titus. In the middle of the Via Sacra is the Temple of Vesta and the House of the Vestals, which contains a long green patch of land in the middle of the complex decorated with statues of famous Vestals, and was the holiest part of the Forum. You can get a brief respite from the sun in this area. Don't forget to look up to see Palatine Hill and the ruins of the Palace of Tiberius and Caligula. On the other side of the Via Sacra lies the Temple of Romulus and the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine, the largest building in the Forum. You can check out the interior of the Temple of Romulus, which has been restored and used for movies.You can then make your way up Palatine Hill, where you can see great views of the Forum and the Colosseum. The Neronian Cryptoporticus (an underground corridor 130 meters long), the House of Livia (wife of Emperor Augustus), the House of Emperor Augustus, the Farnese Gardens, the Stadium of Domitian, and the Palatine Museum are all found in Palatine Hill. Make sure you time your visit to the House of Emperor Augustus right and have a great deal of patience ready because of the long queues. This isn't too easy especially if you can feel the heat radiating from the ancient stones around you as you wait your turn. They can only accommodate a certain number of people at any given time, considering the fragile state of such historic monument, so there might be a long wait.Finally, near the forum arch lie the ruins of the Temple of Venus and Roma, the largest temple in Ancient Rome. You can get a great view of this from the Colosseum. The Arch of Constantine is nearby."

We'd read that due to the state of the site the Forum may not be as interesting to visit as some of Rome's other sites and I guess for the groups of school kids or bus loads of Quick Trip tourists this may be true. If on the other hand you have the time and a little imagination the visit is really unforgettable, especially if the weather is nice and sunny. We strolled round the site and took the time to sit on the benches, enjoy the view and absorb the atmosphere of the site. It only takes a little imagination to picture yourself 2000 years earlier, a really edifying experience."

Make sure you wear comfortable shoes, some part you walk in rock path, so make sure that your shoes are supportive. Roman Forum mostly features the ruin buildings of an ancient Roman city. It is really nice if you purchase the little book at the bookshop in Colosseum which will tell you the story of the places, I guess the name of the book is 'Everyday life in Rome' or something kind of similar name cost 12 Euros. I walk along and look at the book and see how it should be in an Ancient time and how it is now, quite interesting though. There is a house of Augustus as well that limited the number of people to get in there, very interesting place.

This was certainly the way to go (we booked a half day tour that also included the Colosseum - it was great!). Our guide was an archeology major who had actually worked on the grounds uncovering some of the ruins. He was incredibly knowledgable, and laid all the info out perfectly so that we could see the past in our imagination. It was simply incredible to know that we were walking on the same cobblestone roads that Julius Cesear walked on. I highly encourage you to have some sort of guide so you know exactly what your surroundings are."

Think of Juluis Ceasar, Cicero, Tiberius - you name it - the Forum encompasses all that great history.But if you don't want to wander around without really knowing what you are looking at, do your homework beforehand or get an audioguide at the entrance. The Forum surprisingly lacks adequate historic interpretation on site, so you may be unknowingly walking along, for example, were St. Peter was jailed. Same for the Palatine Hill.Remember, if you don't know their significance they may just look like a bunch os scattered stones."

We were there for about an hour during an exhausting day tour, and I just didn\u2019t have it in me to pay attention and appreciate where I was.A quick visit to Wikipedia will tell you more about the Forum than I can. All I remember is seeing a smaller, albeit an older version of the Arc de Triumph, walking down a sometimes uneven dirt road past a line of ancient buildings in various states of disrepair and restoration, and standing in a deserted town square. All the time, our guide\u2019s voice hammering away in my ear through the radio headset, and the hot afternoon sun blaring in my face.My first piece of advice is to make sure you specifically want to see the Forum. Unless you\u2019ve got some sort of passion for it, it\u2019s just another bunch of ruins. The Pantheon and the Colosseum will satisfy any fleeting interest in Ancient Rome that you might have, whereas the Forum is more for the enthusiasts. And as for your enthusiasm, I really think you need a guided tour to get the most out of it.Secondly, make sure you\u2019ve got the energy for it. We spent the entire day being marched from one landmark to another, and by mid-afternoon, we were completely drained. A fresh look at the Roman Forum should yield a much happier experience.Trust me, it\u2019s not one to be jammed into a non-stop itinerary. Want to see it, take the time to see it, and enjoy it."

There is traces of three historic eras in Roman Forum and so much yet to be revealed and discovered.Save a morning or an afternoon to see all the Forum because it is so big and prepare your legs for a hike. My visit was in December so I recommend hot clothes because the temperatures are between 9\u00baC and 1\u00baC (at 4.30p.m. when dusk begins), but I believe that in the summer you'll need confortable and fresh clothes, hat and sun protector. There's some tree shadows but I believe they are not enough for so much visitors in the summer. Take water with you on winter or summer. You have a fountain (at least) near the Tito's Arch where you can refill your bottle. You don't have a bar or something like it where you can buy water or food so go prepared.When I visited the Forum I found four teams of archeologists working. It's very interesting to see the ruins coming out of the earth and all the methodological work around it. I think that the archeological work is a constant in that place.The Forum don't have an identification in everything that you'll see but I believe that some of those things they are also beginning to understand. It is like an huge 3D puzzle.You'll also find some areas closed to visits once they are under work/construction. So I think that if you visit the Forum in different years or with a months gap you'll find different areas to see. Unfortunately we couldn't some things like de Vespasian Temple.Of my visit I'd stand out the Cesar Tomb where, still today, people leave flowers, the Tito's Arch and the Septimius Severus Arch that has an amazing worked stone, the Curia (house of senate), the Romolo Temple.In the Palatine Hill (included in the visit of the Forum) don't miss the Augustus Residence and the Stadium where the roman athletes practiced for the Olympic Games. Also you can visit the \"small\" Palatino Museum where you can find some pieces that where found in the Palatino Hill.In the museum you'll find many copies of the original pieces once they are on the Capitoline Museum, but it's interesting to see gathered what was found exactly in that hill.In the Stadium is easy to find yourself picturing the athletes training in that space, it's a really interesting place.Use the maps that are all around to guide yourself and to realize what you have already seen and what is left. I think it's always something missing because there are so many things. It's a small town inside Rome. But these maps are really a good help.Near the ticket office you can rent an audio guide if you wish.Also, you have a combined ticket of the Forum&Palatine Hill and the Coliseum. We used the Roma Pass for both (it counts as one ticket)."

Notice the small enclosed site that is somewhat hidden and close to the arch...there may be a small group of people gathered there and flowers scattered nearby. It is not advertised, but this is the spot that Julius Caesar's body was cremated. Also ask a guard to point out the prison that housed 2 of Christ's disciples just before their murders (also not publicized).

How about the eyewitness guide to Rome for starters. Why not read something of ancient Roman history before you go. Read about Romulus and Remus, about the Caesars, Julius, Augustus and Nero. Think about the intrigues, the poisonings and murders that happened around and in these ancient ruins, the place where Julius Caesar stood to address the crowds and where he was stabbed to death. The site of the Roman sennet. Go to the site of Augustus's house and look down into the great palaces and gardens where so much brutal and intriguing history happened. Gaze at the triumphal arches of Titus and Septimius Severus and read of their place in Roman history and imagine the cohorts of soldiers marching through them. Imagine the orators standing on the rostra begging the Romans to lend them their ears. Walk around the temple of Julius Caesar that marks the place of his cremation and wonder at the exploits of that great man. And after that there is still the house of the vestal virgins, the temple of Antonius and Faustina and much much more to consider. Fantastic, what a day out."

The center of ancient Rome and of the Roman civilization, where everything happened. Not to be missed. My favorite spots in the Forum are the temple of Divus Julius, where you can see the very place where body is was cremated and where Romans still place flowers: the house of the Vestales with the peaceful garden. I would also like to give two tips. The first I recommend to get the audiovisual: it changes the perception of the visit, as you get valuable information and you can see monuments as they used to be. The second is to visit the Palatine. It is the place where the imperial palace and the houses of the rich were built. It is less famous than the Forum but for some reason even more attractive. Do not miss the house of Augustus on the Palatine! Finally, buy the combined ticket which includes the Coloseum: you may use it even the following day and you will miss the very long queue. You should allocate at least three hours to enjoy the full visit."

It only costs 5\u20ac extra for the 1 1/2 hour tour AND you get to skip the long line for your 12\u20ac ticket (which also includes the Coliseum and a 2nd day).  Also be sure to bring water with you - there is no where inside to buy any and it gets HOT. Also there is no food/snacks available within the Forum and picnicking is not allowed as of Oct 1."

The Forum and Palatine Hill took us five hours and we still didn't see everything.We hired an audio guide - but it was perplexing to say the least. The marked route led us to a vineyard (!) in the middle of the site - obviously the wrong way but it had a wonderful view of the Colosseum and an archaeological dig of Nero's Domus Aurea was going on - so getting lost was a somewhat pleasant experience. However, once on the right track, the audio guide posts are not numbered so you have to figure it out yourself with the help of map which lacked detail. I would suggest going with a real-life guide to save the frustration.Many of the wonderous parts of the site were blocked - the Arch of Septimus Severis was undergoing restoration at the time of our visit in early October 2012 and could only be viewed from outside a fence. The Temple of Antonius and Faustina is covered with scaffolding and inaccessible. However, this did not detract from the site as a whole. Especially poignant was the site of the cremation of Julius Caesar which, after 2000 plus years, had flowers placed there.There are no cafes inside the Forum but there are plenty of places to fill your water bottle - and you'll need to as it is hot, dusty work walking around. There are clean, recently built restrooms near the Temple of Saturn. Wear comfortable shoes which have some grip as the marble is slippery in places. Also, don't miss the museum on Palatine Hill which contains treasures excavated from the site, such as busts of Imperial 'superstars' such as Agrippina II and Nero.Get there on opening, expect it to be tiring, take plenty of rest breaks in the shade and you will thoroughly enjoy your day (and it will take a day!)."

The Roman Forum is an ancient social, business and political center similar to the capitals of modern countries. It was originally a marketplace and later developed with several government buildings. It became a power center of Rome for centuries. The Roman Forum today is an area of ruins of temples, arches and basilicasIt was not until the 18th century that the Forum was rediscovered, and the process to restore the ancient ruins was started. The restoration brought this long-standing historical site back to life. The site includes the temples of Concord, Vespasian, the Porticus of the Dei Consentes on the west, the Temple of Saturn, Basilica Iulia, the Temple of Castor and Pollux on the south, the Temple of Vesta and the Regia on the east, and the Basilica Aemilia and Curia Iulia on the north."

One of my students once described it as a pile of rubble and I wanted to inflict corporal punishment. You do need a map to know what you're looking at but put yourself in the footsteps of Julius and Augustus Caesar, Brutus and Cassius and so forth and let your imagination wander as you do. Try to do so near dusk when the light hits the monuments so well. And don't hurry it!"

The garden of the Vestile Virgins remain somewhat intact and you can imagine life there for the chosen few. It was very hot when we were there so plan to go early so you don't have to suffer in the heat of the day. Since the Coloseum is adjacent tot the Forum we visited both in the same day. It was too hot to linger long at the Forum and we opted to skip Palentine Hill due to the extreme heat. In retrospect, depending on how thorough you want to be in your visit of these you might consider taking 2 days here in this are if the weather is too hot. There is no shade to escape the intense sun."

If you can, buy a combo ticket online at www.ticketclic.it this will include the Colosseum and it will help you bypass the long lines at the Colosseum.3. If it is a hot day, take water and consider an umbrella. There is NO shade. We were dying after 40 minutes. There is a fountain to refill bottles near the Arch of Titus. Nothing is sold inside. 4. Rent either their audio guide, hire a guide or download Rick Steve's free audio guide. We used Rick Steve's it was OK and lasted around 45 minutes. If you are a history buff you probably want something more detailed than Rick Steve's. Nothing will make sense if you don't have some form of a guide.5. Do the Colosseum first, plenty of shade there, after baking in the sun at the Forum you won't feel like doing much else.6. It does make good sense to do both the Forum and the Colosseum together. They are right next to each other."

We waited about 20 minutes in the heat of August for tickets to get in - if you are under 26 and a member of the EU, you can get a discount but they insist on seeing a passport for identification - we saw numerous young people being denied the discount because they didn't bring ID with them. The wait is only 20-30 minutes in line to get tickets once we found the entry - we heard it was a much longer line at the Coloseum, so get your tickets at the Forum. The tickets give you entry to both the Forum and the Colosseum. It was a very hot August day, but amazing to see so many historical sites and imagine how life was at the Forum in Ancient Rome. We were very moved by the site of the Vestal Virgins, ringed by headless statues but with the beautiful innner ponds intact with flowers where these young women sworn to chastity for 30 years served as priestesses guarding the adjacent temple flame. Fascinating to see the preserved site where Julius Ceasar's body burned for 7 days after his death, and the Arch of Titus which amazingly celebrated the destruction and looting of Jerusalem - so very moving. There are the ruins of the Roman court of justice here too - built on a vast scale. Many christian places of worship were modelled on this great hall of justice, including St. Peter's Basicllica at the Vatican, which you can see has to two wide side ailes and the centre nave, just as the ruins of the palace of justice have at the Forum. This is a site where it is best to read up ahead or follow a guided or audio tour, in order to understand what you are seeing and what used to be there. Just wish we could better picture in our minds how it really must have been two thousand years ago. So much history - not to be missed!"

Turns out they had introduced a new rule recently where the dual tickets are valid for 2 days but for only 1 entrance to the Forum/Palatine areas and the same for entry to the colosseum. It was written in very small text at base of ticket but we were never warned of this. We protested but it was no good. Luckily as this was the last admission (4pm) for the day a tour guide kindly gave us a spare ticket and the attendant then turned a blind eye and let us both in.

Judging by other reviewers I can tell that I'm in the minority and certainly it didn't help that we didn't go with a guide. I think to make sense of anything that you see in the Forum, you'd certainly need some kind of guide/audio tour. Most of the ruins were so eroded that they were little more than nubs in the dry earth - no matter how imaginative you are, there is simply not enough left to reconstruct in your mind's eye how it might have looked. I personally felt that these ruins were in such a bad state, that the whole area did not reflect good value for money. If you want Roman ruins, go elsewhere."

The only power remaining in the city was that of the Catholic Church. And, then, the ruins were not so old and tourism wasn't such a booming industry. So, most of was left was scavenged to build new monuments... Christian monuments: churches and statues, mostly. What we see now, is what remained under ground, concealed from lazy scavengers' eyes, or what couldn't be taken apart for some reason (rope marks on some columns attest that these guys DID try). So, don't forget to bring your... (no, not your credit card!) your imagination! Even as it stands today after so many centuries of recycling efforts, it is somewhat impressive, and the closest anyone can be to walking through the capital of the Roman Empire.On the practical side, visitors get a ticket that covers the Forum, the Colosseum and the Palatine Hill. You may get the ticket for free as part of the Roma Pass: free entrance to 2 attractions is included, you have to choose where and when to use them; using one of them here is reasonable as it is one of the most expensive attraction fees in town."

It gets stuffy in there, however\u2014very bad air flow.If you plan on seeing the Coliseum, Palatine Hill & Forum in one day, I'd advise that you visit in the order listed. After seeing the Coliseum, you'll exit behind the Arch of Constantine. Don't go back to the Via dei Fori Imperiali, which you'd likely take to access the Coliseum. Instead, take the road to the left of the Coliseum exit (Via San Gregorio) and go upwards to the lesser known entrance of the Palatine Hill. There should be either no line there or a very tiny one. When you are finished with the Palatine Hill, you can enter the Forum directly without reentering any lines outside. Go down the ankle-twisting original stone path carefully! You'll be facing in the direction of the Coliseum on this path and enter the Forum by the Arch of Titus.I booked my online reservations through OmniTicket before my trip: the Coliseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill three-in-one ticket. It cost 13.50 Euro per ticket for all three sites and no wait in line. There's no signs or separate entry area for the three-in-one ticket, so just go to the area designated for the Roma Pass, raise up your printed-out ticket, and the guards will let you in."

The wait at the ticket counter took us about 20 minutes, but it didn't really feel that long.The forum itself is filled with history, and I would highly recommend getting some kind of guide, whether by audio or by book. I used the Tripadvisor guide to get some more information about the things we were looking at.It's a good stroll and you can easily spend an hour here before going over to the Coliseum or the Palatine Hills."

Now the Forum ticket is combined with Palatine Hill and the Colosseum for 12 Euros, which is actually a fair deal. I recommend getting an audio guide or bringing a guidebook otherwise you won\u2019t know what it is you are looking at, particularly in the Forum and on Palatine Hill. Rome was having a heat wave when I visited and so if you go when it is hot, a hat, sunscreen and water are indispensible. Allow yourselves plenty of time to visit the three sites. My best advice is to go early around opening time and do the visit in this order \u2013 The Forum, Palatine Hill and the Colosseum. When I got off the metro I turned right instead of joining the huge crowds lined up at the Colosseum across the street. You will see a small entrance a short way up the road on the left. This is the entrance to the Forum. There were only a few people in front of me so it went very quickly. When I got inside I had the place practically to myself for the first 20 minutes. It was magic to be able to take in so much history without any crowds and to be able to take some nice photos. After the Forum, I turned right up on Palatine Hill. No need to wait in line to get in as it is \u201cattached\u201d to the Forum\u201d. There are less crowds up here than down below in the Forum section plus beautiful gardens and views to appreciate. Make sure to go all the way to the stadium. Then afterwards you leave the exit and go right across to the Colosseum and no need to wait in line as you already have your ticket! By having visited these three sites in this order you will have saved the \u201cbest for last\u201d because the Colosseum is the mostly visually complete and impressive of the three. It is inconceivable that one would go to Rome and not see these sites! A must-do experience in spite of the crowds."

On one side the site is off limits to tourists actually entering it. The street is a few feet about the site and you can look down upon the ruins. Unfortunately nothing is labeled so everything just looks like either 1) standing pillars or 2) fallen pillars. The other half of the forum tourists can enter but everything can once again be seen from street level, which I highly recommend. I did foolishly enter the forum and walked around. Absolutely nothing is labelled. Once again it is either standing or fallen pillars. No perspective is given. The site is also very poorly kept. I did have the misfortune of using the restroom there.

The Roman Forum and the massive arches looked marvelous. Saw some students in archeology still painstakingly digging for more artifacts to be unearth. Anybody who appreciates history, arts, and architecture besides knowing the culture and character of the city, will love Rome."

            "review": "Major Rome attraction, slightly spoiled by the awful audioguide. The Roman Forum is one of the major sights no visitor to Rome should miss. It covers quite an extensive area in the centre of the city and contains the remains of many Roman temples to deities such as Saturn, Vesta and Castor and Pollux, triumphal arches, such as the Arch of Titus, the senate house, and much more. Although we very much enjoyed our visit, we were disappointed by the poor quality of the audioguide. We normally pay for an audioguide when they are available, because we think they effortlessly allow the visitor to appreciate the key features of a sight at their own pace. In the forum there were no plaques by the monuments to identify them, and so half of the time we were using the audioguide, we were trying to make sure we were looking at the building or monument which was being described. Perhaps on this occasion a guided tour would have been preferable. However, despite this criticism, a visit to the Roman Forum is recommended, and if this is the sort of attraction for you, then I would recommend that you investigate a visit to Ostia Antica, a short train ride out of the city."

The 'exhibits' themselves are not labelled etc so its anyone's guess as to what you're looking at. Many people found this annoying, but if you use your imagination, you can paint the picture yourself. There were guides and audio guides available so it's probably worth getting one if you're really interested in the site. Some of the relics and remains are really lovely and intact, especialy the columns and temple entrances, and are definitely worth visiting, even if you just walk straight through the site. Great value as 12euro gets you entry to the Forum, Colosseum and Palatino, and could last you all day. TIP: take plenty of water and a hat; there's very limited shade and it gets extremely hot."

We arrived at the colosseum around nine am and the line was very short. Most people are on tours and go in a different line. When we went to see the forum we entered through palatine hill entrance. We had the frommers Italy guidebook, but it started from one of the many other entrances. Everything is badly labelled, so the people on guided tours probably got a lot more out of their experience. Many areas were being renovated or excavated so were closed to the public. Despite this, there was so much to see so close together that I was overwhelmed with wonder. Being from Canada, I couldn't help but think how the new world was a baby in comparison to Europe. tips: buy tickets early in the day, bring snacks, dress weather appropriate as there is no shade or shelter. There are water fountains and toilets. We finished the colosseum, palatine hill and the forum by two thirty. Lots of souvenir vendors and snack trucks located directly outside the area.

Bring food & water, though, because I'm not sure that you can go out and come back in. The combined pass is good for two days and there are reductions for students of art, history, or education. You need to have something that states your discipline. My student card wouldn't work because it didn't have my major on it.

Come from the Victoria Emmanuel memorial, you should take the road on the left and head towards the Colosseum, passing by the Trajan's Market. The entrance to the Forum and the ticket kiosk is on your right.There is a set of toilets behind the kiosk next to the book store before you enter the turnstiles.Wear comfortable shoes as the paths are not even. There are no set path and you could decide on an audio guide either from the bookstore or one of the free apps available online or you could just do like I did - a book. Whichever way, its still amazing to see the centre of the Roman empire.For me, seeing the forum is more amazing that the Colosseum. It is up there with the Parthenon and the Acropolis in Athens.We spent about 2 hours in the forum and another 2 hours in the Palentine Hill (which is accessible from the forum).

The roman forums is breathtaking when you enter the grandiose columns and beautiful ruins really gives you a feel of how Huge the centre of Roma was. We purchased a 2 day pass (\u20ac12 each for EU members) which grants you access to the roman forum, the Paletine hill and the colloseum over the 2 days. I recommend doing the forum \u00a0and Paletine hill first, as the ques in the colloseum can be a couple hours.\u00a0We also bought an audio guide (in uk English). This came with a map of the forum, which was badly put together, and the audio guide keypad itself which, with out headphones plugged in (not supplied), is quite difficult to hear. The audio guide comprised of numbers on the map which you entered into the audio guides keypad, this is then supposed to give you information about what you're seeing. However because the map is badly drawn, it is difficult to see what you are supposed to be looking at, and at times you will be looking around on the spot trying to see what the audio is talking about, plus the sites are rarely signposted; This can be very frustrating.\u00a0There were parts of the forum blocked off making it impossible to follow the audio guide tour in a linear fashion.\u00a0Whilst we were there we over heard an official guide tour group, he was himself saying how awful the audio guides are and that a tour guide (group) is the best way. However he went on to quite ingeniously con his group into paying \u20ac45 for a tour of the Vatican the next day, explaining that it is quite the same experience. Meaning that there are no plaques/ info points to help you know what your seeing.Our personal recommendation, is to get a guide book in advanced, there are many to choose from; the best being 'Rome and the vatican city, a complete guide with itineraries' this is a brilliant guide as it has all the architectural information as well as historical backgrounds and paintings information. It cost \u20ac10 in most souvenir shops in roma.\u00a0If you plan to visit the forum and do the palatine hill also, it is a high recommendation to wear good strong foot wear and have plenty of drinks and food available, there are however fountains you can refill bottles at. Although there is nowhere to buy food, you will need it as you will use plenty of energy walking!\u00a0"

We inquired at the ticket booth where they confirmed this. When asked how long it would take, they said 3 hours. For some reason, the tour did not begin at the entrance, but at some \"House of Livia\". OK, we went there, wandered around the area for some 20-30 minutes, because there is almost no signs or they are just all confusing. We finally managed to find this \"House of Livia\" only to listen to something not very informative about some ancient mugs... The guide went in so much detail without giving a general background. It lasted for about 20 minutes and that was it! As it turned out, there was NO tour of the whole Forum area, only of this \"House of Livia\"!! But there was no way to know it, because nowhere at the entrance did it say that the \"guided tour\" means \"the House of Livia\" tour. Disappointment. They should have made it clear."

The Basilica of Maximus and the Temple of Romulus (1700 years old) very impressive. Good hiking shoes a must - the Roman cobblestones are killers - not like the regular cobblestones in the streets. The Rick Steves audio tour is very good for the Forum. RomaPass holders take note: You must visit Palatine Hill and the Forum in the same day as they are connected. If you buy a separate combination ticket it is good for 2 days, but not with the RomaPass. We visited Palatine Hill and the Colosseum 1 day and went back to the Forum the second day on the way to Capitoline Hill. We were told at the gate we had to buy a Forum ticket. When we were there the Arch of Septimius Severus was blocked due to renovation."

I highly recommend some form of guidance as there isn't signage describing what you are seeing. We used the FREE Rick Steves app/audio guide (on iPods with earbuds) which lasts about 45 minutes and took us from the Arch of Titus through all the various sites in the Forum (screen shows what you should be seeing) and does a fabulous job of setting the scene and describing the temples, columns, arches, the Senate, the rostrum \u2014 all things I wouldn't have understood without it. With it, the Forum was an amazing experience; you are transported back to the time of the Republic and its turnover to an Empire, you can walk in the steps of slaves and emperors, you can truly imagine its former greatness. The only area under restoration during our visit was the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina -- everything else was in its restored glory right beside the traffic of modern Rome. Not to be missed."

And for his last statement, he said you HAD to visit the St. Peter's Bascilia in Vatican City to see where all the glories were taken, and then realize that the Roman Forum was several streets with many domed buildings and St. Peter's is ONLY 1 building, so multiply that and you would imagine Rome back then.

The statues, the pillars, the ornamented stones, it's not hard to imagine the people walking around here in the ancient times. It's something one should NOT miss when in Rome."

The Roman Forum is part of a trio of historical sites along with the colleseum and palatin hill.The Forum by itself is partly visible from the nearby street which has several view points on the Forum, but don't let that mislead you - visiting inside is definitiley worth every euro as you practically walk inside Rome's history - Columns, sites, buildings and gates unravel before you the might of the ancient Roman Empire - a real must.I recommend buying your combined ticket (valid for all 3 sites) on the roman forum entrance - saves a very long line in the colleseum (see roninrome.com for more details on this). visiting the Forum first and exiting near the Collesum for the grand finalle!"

Cobbled streets where Nero, Julius Ceasar, et al once strolled. Temples where they worshipped. The Curia where the Roman Senate met (and murdered). The weight of history is palpable in the very stones. Although large chunks of the Forum and the adjacent Palatine Hill always seem to be roped off for either safety or archeological work, there are still several acres of ruins (with new bits being put on show all the time) to gawp at. And if that isn't enough, the Trajan Markets and Colosseum are next door. If you only see one thing in Rome, this really has to be it."

The \"Forum\" part was hard to decipher as so much of it was down. I almost wish that parts of the site had been restored to give some sense of what it would have felt like to live there (a home, the forum, etc.). We did, however, explore one of the underground passages where some of the plaster walls and frescoes were still intact. Had to peek through a window at the house of Lydia which is being restored, but the dust made it hard to see details. Still, it's interesting to see what the Romans were able to accomplish in terms of architecture and city planning without the aid of modern technology. The archways at both ends of the site are a \"don't miss\" feature as well as Nero's temple. The gardens are restful and the site was still a great way to spend the day exploring. Too much to see in a single day, well worth the trip."

We already saw the Coliseum, already saw Palatine (and once you seen them once, there's not much more to see and do 2nd or 3rd times), but the Roman Forum was great to stroll through because there is so much to see in the ruins. Waiting in line for tickets, or buying in advance when you don't plan to see the Coliseum or Palatine again is not worth it. IF you want to get a great view of the Roman Forum for free just go up to Capitoline hill behind the museum....or if you happen to go to Capitoline Museum too. Having binoculars helps with the details. We always bring a pair of light binoculars with us and they are quite useful."

The forum wasn't crowded when we were there so we took advantage of the wonderful views, sat down and drank from their water fountains.

Great memories with the family strolling through the forum making up songs in the rain. Some people might say it's just a bunch of old arch debris, but it is history. If you don't have a few hours to \"roam\" around inside, there are plenty of places to look into the forum from the outside without paying the fee. Not the same experience, but at least the minimum you should do."

I've been to Rome several times over the years and the Roman forum has always been a great attraction that I've taken family and friends to for a stroll around. The ruins are impressive and give a real sense of what it must have been like in ancient Rome. I always thought the best way to approach the Forum was from the Capitoline hill after visiting the Campidoglio (and the continuing the walk to the Colosseum) but was disappointed (in fact rather annoyed) to find that they have introduced an entrance fee and barred access from either the Capitoline or the Colosseum (there are exit only gates now) and you have to walk around to a new entrance roughly in the middle of the site located on Via dei Fori Imperali and stump up a \u20ac12 fee (this does also cover access to the Colosseum and Palatine but since we had been to the Capitoline museums there wouldn't have been time to visit all the sites). A shame, not only has a great walking route (recommended in many guide books) been ruined, the fee will deter many visitors, especially those on a budget or with limited time. Also although it has been in place for a few years, we found we were among a stream of visitors still trying to approach from the Capitoline (it provides a great view of the Forum and a specific viewing area in the museum) only to be unable to be greeted by a No-entry sign and gate."

Take a guide book to explain what you're looking at otherwise you might miss things like the Temple of Vesta where the Vestal Virgins tended the flame of the goddess and temple of the Gemini (Castor and Pollux the twin gods).

We did however visit it first thing in the morning on our first day as we had been told that the ticket for the forum could also be used to get in to the colosseum without so much queuing (this is true and I would strongly recommend doing this).  The Forum covers quite a large area really with a large number of buildings (or rather the remains of buildings) on the site. I personally enjoyed the curia (with bronze doors dating from ancient Roman times still intact), the house of the vestal virgins and the Arch of Titus to be most impressive. The views of the colosseum from the Arch of Titus are well worth taking a photo of. I'm very pleased that we arrived very early. We got there about 15-20 minutes after opening and there were only 2 people ahead of us in the queue so we were in in no time at all. When we left a couple of hours later the queue was horrendous! Do go early. They have an audio guide available which was fairly pricey and you have to leave an item of ID (such as passport or drivers licence) with them as security. Don't bother with this. Whilst I don't doubt the accuracy of the information contained on the audio guide it was dry, boring and unengaging and we stopped using it within the first 20 minutes of our visit. take a good guide book with maps of the forum with you instead."

We then attempted to tour the Forum on our own with the aid of the audioguide sold at the ticket booth. While informative, the audioguide only rarely attempts to orient you to the particular area that it is explaining, and frequently neglects to tell you that you should be moving on to another area while listening to an explanation that began at another point. You have only a tiny map with even tinier number signs on it to indicate when you should enter that number into your audioguide and listen to the explanation. Two thousand year old ruins look remarkably similar, so unless the audioguide said, \"To the left of the three columns which are still standing is the _____\" , you were at a complete loss as to whether you were actually gazing at the particular ruin the audioguide was describing. Going more or less blindly through all 13 explanations was a torture, and I observed my 15 year old's eyes glazing over at about #3. All in all, a frustrating excursion and a missed opportunity."

It's great that Rome is investing in taking care of the site, but when I was in Rome 4 years ago it was much more open to wander around. I had a tour for the site. I think you need either a tour guide or an audio guide otherwise it's hard to know what you are looking at. The water fountains inside the Forum were a definite plus as it was a hot day. The ruins are an interesting when you have a guide to give you the historical perspective, but the ruins at Pompeii are much better preserved and give you a much better picture of life in ancient Italy."

It gets very hot and there isn't much shade.Your entrance ticket for the colosseum also allows you entry here. So you don't need to pay extra.Buy your combi tickets ( here, palatine and colosseum) either here or at the Palatine. This saves you from standing in long queues at the colosseum. They are \u20ac12 each.Don't go at the weekend, it's far too busy.if you can, go mid week towards the end of the day.Your combo ticket is valid over 2 days, so it is perfectly possible to visit all 3 sites in the afternoons of 2 consecutive days.If you go to the Palatine first you can wonder round there...get to the gardens at the back, where you will see some stunning views over Rome and then wonder down a path at the back of the gardens into the Forum. Much better than having to go back outside and find another entrance to the forum.Take a good guidebook or an audio guide with you. Like many of the attractions in Rome, the visitor information is non-existent! Wondering around without a guide you'll have no idea what you are looking at, or the importance of it! It may seem a hasstle at the time but it's worth itFor those of you that like photography, you can get some absolutely fantastic pictures here. The ruins make some great images and come out stunning in black and white.It's definitely one of the top 5 things we did in Rome and I'd highly recommend it."

It's basically a huge area with a bunch of trashed old buildings in it, taking up space in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the world. Just think how much this land alone could be sold for! But instead, the Romans honor the past. It's admirable, incredibly respectful, and astounding.This is a must see, for the history that happened here. As others have noted the ruins in it are not at all well marked- in fact they're not marked at all, so bring a guidebook. Like all other places we went in Italy, they do not hand you a free brochure with admission.The altar that Julius Caesar was cremated on is here, in a small enclosed area very near the semi-circular remains of the temple of the Vestal Virgins. To this day people still leave fresh flowers on the altar. Also check out the rostra, where Mark Antony is said to have delivered his \"Friends, Romans, countrymen\" speech (by way of Shakespeare). There is a reconstructed Senate building (the Curia, I believe) that's worth a look, although it wasn't what I would have pictured. I believe the Senate moved numerous times and took numerous forms. And Caesar was not killed here at the Forum. He was murdered at the nearby Largo Argentina, near the Pantheon and Campo de Fiore. (for Caesar buffs like myself!)"

Many of the tour guides are burnt out and have (sorry to say this) contempt for American Tourists (read on for proof). I asked my Palatine Hill Tour guide if I should also hire a guide for my Roman Forum visit the next day. She assured me that there was no need to hire a guide and that I would find many signs in english explaining everything on the forum grounds. I believed her and thought the TA reviews were outdated. Not sure why this tour guide lied to me. Her english was perfect. She seemed nice. She gave a great tour (though a bit shorter than I expected). Everyone in our group was polite and respectful and interested in what she had to say. She went out of her way to convince me that I shouldn't hire a tour guide for my Forum visit as everything would be explained in signs in english. Because of her advice I walked in to the forum without anything and I actually cried when I realized that the best part of my visit in Ancient Rome had turned into a disaster. I was standing in the middle of history and had no idea what I was looking at. Hope this review helps you plan your visit better."

I would suggest reading a guide book about it beforehand and buying one of those small books which allow you to see what the Forum looked like in its heyday. You can get, either on Amazon or in Rome, books which have transparent overlays over photos of modern day Rome. These are very useful to compare how it looks now with how it used to look. There's not much explanatory material in the Forum itself and many of the buildings are in a very ruined state which makes it hard to know what you are looking at if you haven't read up beforehand.Also, consider buying a Roma Pass or booking another advance ticket so that you can dodge the ticket queues.Within the Forum my favourite building is the spectacular Basilica Maxentius which is a large vaulted building. This building used to contain a giant statue of the emperor Constantine, who was an extemely influential person in history. The excellently preserved remains of this statue can still be seen in the Musei Capitolini which overlooks the Forum."

Until our days the \"eternal city\" more-or-less preserved Forum Troyan (to the left of the wide street Via dei Fori Imperiale, hacked with Mussolini directly on the ancient ruins of the Altar to the Coliseum) and the Forum of Caesar and the Roman Forum (on the right side) and countless statues of emperors on the sides. Both forums are interesting: Forum Troy - well-preserved ruins of the shopping malls of the market, as well as constant column of the Emperor, and the right forum - the Arch of Titus, Temple of the Vestal, the ruins of the Temple of Saturn's famous Cloaca Maxima, etc. In addition, at Rome, in the middle ancient ruins, towering several Christian basilicas in excellent condition. Won \"conglomerate\" of the front tier of ancient columns (remaining from the pagan temple) and built them the facade of the Christian church. Generally, among the ruins of the forums are very pleasant and interesting walk. At least, so it was in February: the people a little, not too hot, but comfortable (15), we can all safely view. I think the summer there is not so rosy - red-hot stones to heat up to high temperatures, and the crowds are unlikely to quietly walk! At the checkout you can take the audio guide and a plan in Russian, for some reason we refused and very sorry! Outright to figure out what pieces of columns refer to the temple of Castor and Pollux, and which, for example, to the temple of Vestal - rather difficult. For example, we walk through the ruins and see a small round, half-grown into the ground structure, around which crowded Turistas with cameras and enthusiasm, this house is removed. Looking inside, we saw nothing except some hatch and heaped on him heaps of flowers. It was only later discovered that at this place in a kind of shaggy were burnt body of Julius Caesar!"

We returned to the bookstore and purchased a guide, but that, too, was poorly written with an incomplete map and very few photos. So, we enjoyed our visit, but it was frustrating to spend so much time trying to figure out what everything was. Really, a simple numbering system and map would be enough.

If you go through the Palatine entrance, be warned that there is a hike to get to the forum. Don't bother with the audio guide. Even though they give you a labeled map of all the ruins, it is very hard to figure out what you are actually looking at (as the ruins themselves are not labeled). My traveling partner and I spent a long time trying to figure out what we were supposed to be looking at. I would highly recommend getting a guided tour or at least having a very good map. Highlights include the Tempio di Vesta, the Arco di Tito, the gigantic Basilica di Massenzio, and the Arco di Settimio Severo. The whole place is very interesting and layered with history, but don't expect to see complete structures. Most everything is a fragment (or single column) of what it once was. Overall, it took us about 3 hours to get through but probably would have been shorter if we had known what things were. Entrance to the Roman Forum is included with your ticket to the Colosseum (and also includes Palatine Hill, which you can access from the Roman Forum), so take advantage of it."

Suggestion: We bought a small book available at souvenir stands all over Rome that shows photos of present-day ruins along with an acetate overlay showing what the structures probably looked like when they were intact.

            "review": "Roman Forum. When you visit the Roman Forum you are walking on what are among the most important few acres in the history of western civilization. Having said that, the significance of much of what you are looking at will not be readily apparent without doing some homework. I would not wait until you arrive in Rome to become aquainted with the forum and its environs. There is tons of good material available online and reading a good book or two on ancient Rome ahead of time will greatly enhance the experience.In addition, I would devote some time to the study of a good map of the forum. Once you have familiarized yourself with the area you will be less likely to walk by what you think is just a pile of rocks instead of recognizing, for example, the rostra, where Brutus eulogized Julius Ceaser and countless orators extolled the virtues and condemned the vices of Rome.A visit to the Roman Forum will be an unforgettable experience, and with good preparation it will be for the better."

We had a guide book that we brought in England, but it was a little confusing to work out what each building was. We decided to purchase a book from one of the stalls by the Colosseun for 10 Euros. It showed how the Roman Forum used to look and what it looks like now, so we were able to match up the two. We found it very useful and had a better understanding of what he would of looked like. You can also go on a free guided tour which meets outside the Colosseum, but we chose not to. This place is not to be missed, we went back twice."

            "review": "Confused at the Forum?. As the previous reviews suggest, there are no English signs or explanations for the tourists at most of the tourist attractions. But then there is the old adage 'When in Rome..' We found the Forum a bit confusing with all the attractions but no explanations. Luckily the hotel provided a free guide 'Welcome Guida Di Roma' which was free and has pictures and English/Italian description of each of the attractions. We found this useful and identified the places we visited. The only thing surprisingly missing from the Guide was Julius Caeser`s grave/monument? One of the guides we overheard said that it was where he was cremated whilst another guide suggested that they burnt his remains there."

            "review": "need a guide or guidebook. We don't like guided tours, but at the Forum, you could use one, or at least a really good book showing then and now pictures of the Forum buildings. We listened to some of the tour guides and they made it sound more interesting, but you still need a picture book (or a guide with a big picture book) to make it a good experience."
