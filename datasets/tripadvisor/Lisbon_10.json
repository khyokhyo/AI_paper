Really not sure what it would be like in peak season so I am basing my review when we were there. Lines were short and quick. The various aquariums housing the many different species of fish around the world is incredible. Go slow and get the full experience with all the creatures that you will probably never get to see again unless going to remote untouched Islands. The Sunfish was my highlight. Easy to get to by train. After the Oceanarium why not stop off at the shopping Centre. It's huge. Make a whole day of it. Remember, you are on holidays so bring your friend \"Patience\" with you. No rush, just love it."

Once inside, however, the site had more than enough capacity to absorb all visitors. The Oceanarium offers a huge central aquarium, surrounded by other exhibits. The clever layout makes sure that there are always new nooks and crannies to see, without ever sacrificing the feeling of being absorbed by the greatness of the seas. If you are curious about sealife, Oceanarium is a must."

I am always impressed with the variety species held there, the animals seem happy and the recreation of their natural environment is astonishing. It's always full of people but in a week day you can walk at ease and appreciate the sharks, see the enormous sunfish, the devil rays, otters, and others. The price it can be considered a bit high, but you have to remind that in order to maintain a piece of nature that size for us to see it's expensive and requires so much effort, that I can say the price is fair. You can take your children with you. Another very important thing about this Oceanarium is that they work together with WWF in a perspective to save our oceans. It's a great place were you can spend easily more than 2 hours wandering."

There is a huge two story tank in the middle that you walk around while seeing everything and the fish include large stingrays, sharks, barracudas and others. You can sit on benches and watch the fish swimming. It is great for kids. The Orient metro station is about a 10 minute walk to the aquarium."

I would especially recommend the otter exhibit - we caught them at feeding time (noon-ish) and it was the cutest thing I've ever seen.There's also a gondola life next to the Ocenarium that provides some really nice views of the city.

Due to the size there are very large sharks, rays and other sensational animals to see.Very kid friendly and lots of room to see the panoramas regardless of age or height .Several exhibits such as penguins have external exhibits where you get close to the animals above water and then later see them underwater.Area is near a restaurant complex so you can take a lunch break and then return for more."

We were captivated by the display and even more so as we watched children enraptured and excited.There are signs all the way along the entry way, reminding us of how deeply important the sea is to all of us and the necessity of doing a good job of being stewards of our earth, suggesting ways each of us can help. It was very impactful and effective.So, all in all, but entertaining and educational."

There are no shows, no external viewing areas. Like most oceanariums, it has a large central tank with lots of varieties of fish including sharks. It has a lot of viewing areas available to view the central tank. It has smaller exhibits of fish from very ocean and region from around the world. It has an antarctic penguin exhibit that is excellent. Overall a great way to spend a couple of hours in the late afternoon. It is best to visit between 4pm and 7pm when it is much quieter and not as crowded."

The information displayed is very useful and easy to understand and read for all ages.

Even on a weekday in October there was still a long queue to buy tickets and then had to shuffle round all the tanks waiting our turn to get to the front to see the marine life. A lot of the walkways are dark so not great. Although the central aquarium can be seen from all the zones (Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Antarctic) it's really the same fishes you see each time. I enjoyed the penguins, starfish, jellyfish, garden eels and smaller creatures more than the bigger fish in the central aquarium. Although each tank had signage there were no touch pools or feeding times or any interactive activities for children. We spent two hours at the attraction but that was moving slowly with the crowds. Not the best value even with the yellowbus discount making entrance Euro 11.20 each. Think I would have preferred to spend my time visiting the more traditional fado or azulejo museum."

Smaller aquariums are around the edges with smaller creatures, the octopus tank is mesmerizing, you could watch it for hours. Quite expensive by Portuguese standards but worth a visit especially for a rainy day where you don't want to be outside.There is lots of parking but check if the pay and display machines are active.

The maps in the book did not even cover Oriente, where it is located. This only goes to show just how bad some guide book are. This was the best aquarium I have ever seen. It is stupendous. You can get there on the Metro. On leaving the Metro you will have to follow your paper or Google map because there are no signs until you practically arrive there. It is only a 10 or 1 minute walk. The entire area is worth visiting. Oriente was built for Expo 98. It is beautiful, with lots of well-designed modern buildings. The Oceanario is built on a pier jutting out from the promenade. You can either buy your tickets at a machine or you can queue. The machine is a faster option. Tickets costs: Adult: \u20ac13; Child (4-12) \u20ac9; Senior (65+) \u20ac9. Kids below the age of 3 go free. Kids love the Oceanario. It is the second largest aquarium in Europe. It exhibits more than 15,000 living creatures - 450 different species. The Oceanario has a number of floors. The upper most floor houses a temporary exhibition \u2018Submerged Forests\u2019. It does not feel like a temporary exhibition at all. Like everything else at the Oceanario it is splendid.The next two floors house the huge central aquarium. The floors surround this gigantic tank. In the centre there is the main aquarium filled with hundreds of fish, mainly pelagic fish, i.e. fish which live neither close to the bottom nor near the shore. Kids love the sharks and rays. On each floor there are smaller aquariums displaying additional marine species. Many of these are technicoloured species found on reefs. On the upper floor there are surface animals too, such as penguins, sea otters, birds and plants. The sea otters, in particular, are delightful. You should allow at least two hours to get around the Oceanario. The Oceanario does a few unexpected things. There are guided tours. There are sleep-overs for kids \u2013 wake up with the sharks (don\u2019t tell them or they will pester you to death); concerts for babies; they also do birthday parties. You will probably have to drag your kids away.."

He loved seeing all the aquatic life and insisted on visiting this place every single day of our stay in Lisbon. We thought an aquarium is not the kind of place that would interest us adults but we were proven wrong. The \"permanent exhibit\" is marvellous and informative! It opened my life to the serious problem of sea pollution and need for conserving our oceans and sea life. Everything is explained beautifully, we learnt so much! The exhibition wasn't crowded and we didn't have to wait in long queues for the tickets or to see the sea life. If you are in Lisbon you must visit this place and make sure you go with atleast 2-3 hours on hand. Once you come out there is a lovely cafe within the premise serving a wonderful selection of coffees you. I has a large open space for kids to run around an play while you sit outside sipping you coffee. A great place to spend an afternoon in lisbon. Highly recommended!"

The only thing I would say is when you get further on downstairs it is almost complete darkness walking around and it's hard to make your way round without bumping into pushchairs or what not."

It is housed in an interesting very well designed building which features different environments on 2 levels which are sited around a massive central tank with > 400 different species of fish including massive Sunfish which I'd never seen before in any aquarium. Overall it is very well thought out and presented, it also heavily stresses the way we are slowly destroying our oceans and must urgently do something to address this problem. However I've got to say that the sea otters are so cute it's worth visiting just to see them, you can easily pass an hour just watching their antics."

There are enclosures (if that's the right word) where there are sea birds, including penguins, swimming and flying around with a rocky backdrop - and you are there with them.The central \"tank\" holds 5million litres, if I remember correctly, and that is BIG. You view it from several windows aroud the circumference, on ground floor level, or on the first floor. There is a big shoal of fish swimming, I don't know what they were, but they are a blue haze constantly moving in the background. There are lots of other smaller aquariums. The lion fish are huge. The blue tangs and other coral fish are beautiful. I love the camouflaged dragon fish - those guys are so cool, they don't bother to swim, just go with the flow. I took a video of the jellyfish and can't believe how such delicate creatures can survive the oceans.It's excellent value for money. My local Sealife Centre is more expensive, and after this, seems like a pond in comparison.It's very dark inside, but roomy enough not to trip over things, which I've done in my local one.I wanted to go back again next day! It's a must for all lovers of nature. The cafe's ok too."

The whole area around the Oceanarium is on the up with a pleasing feeling of regeneration. The exhibition itself has definitely had recent investment and is an excellent destination. On the day we visited it was busy but not so crowded the tank was obscured with visitors. It's all very clearly described and gives a strong message about the demise of our oceans fish stocks. Whether a visit here will change peoples attitudes to eating sustainable fish I can't say but it was a joy to watch the well stocked aquarium. Allow a good 2 or 3 hours as there's plenty to see and keep your interest."

The sharks are very big and menacing in that zombie-automaton way. The peripheral exhibits are interesting but typical, and not as enthralling as the main tank, which is truly vast and viewable from many different windows. The chilled penguin and puffin enclosures are delightful, as is the tropical area. There is a good cafe just outside near the water-fall sculpture. The exterior architecture with the vista of the water and the teleferique frame the place beautifully. My tip is, if you are there for more than a week, become a member. It is great value, especially if you have children and more than pays for itself in two visits. You just need a photo ID."

When we were there was the Permanent Exhibition (the Oceanarium) and a Temporary Exhibition (Ocean Forrests). We saw both.The Oceanarium is a huge cylindrical tank more than two stories high and covering some 1,000 sq metres on the surface, full of hundreds of species of marine life. You can get some idea of its size from the attached photo where you can see a couple of divers carrying out routine maintenance. You \u201dfollow the arrows\u201d around the exhibition, starting at the top of the aquarium (where you see Marine Otters and Penguins ) and then gradually getting lower so at the end you are on the same level as the floor of the aquarium, some 25 metres below. Around the central tank tare four more aquariums with different marine habitats such as Atlantic, Pacific, Tropical. So, all the way round you see, on your left, scores of fascinating different fish, including sharks and huge rays. Meanwhile, on your right are a series of smaller tanks devoted to the different types of marine life such as coral, starfish, sea urchins, and many, many more. The whole thing is beautifully lit so that some of the vibrant colours are truly startling. All accompanied by serene music. The Temporary Exhibition is less impressive perhaps but still worth a visit. It is a 40 metre long aquarium with brilliantly lit ocean greenery set in a darkened room, creating a relaxing and calming environment. The accompanying music was specially written for the exhibition. We spent 45 minutes just gazing at the beautiful scenes with hundreds of tiny colourful fish. It was quite a shock to get back into the noisy world outside."

The oceanarium is a huge saltwater tank with fish and sea flora from the Atlantic, including sharks, tuna and whole schools of smaller species, a tank surrounded by several other smaller (but still large) tanks with different biotypes: cold - including penguins (that you can watch from below 'flying' in the water) - tropical and temperate. And also exhibitions and smaller aquaria.Kids love it and I don't mind seeing it at least once a year."

As a marine biologist I have been to several aquariums and I can tell you this is the most creative and interesting aquarium I have ever visited. It is difficult to describe so you may just have to trust me when I say it is incredible and a must-see!We paid to visit the temporary exhibition as well as the main permanent aquarium. Completely worth the money! The exhibition at the moment is by a Japanese nature photographer and is like nothing I have ever seen. He created enormous tanks filled with 10000 freshwater fish from the amazon. It is a complete sensory experience. As well as being amazing visually, there are opportunities to hear sounds of the amazon rain forest, to learn about the amazon's resources and also see how the exhibition was made and how it will change over time. The main aquarium was just as amazing. The whole aquarium is centred around one huge tank that stretches across two floors. It is filled with large species such as sharks and rays and also smaller schooling fish. There are several viewing points all the way round. There is even a sofa by one of the viewing points and I could have sat there mesmerised for hours. As well as the main tank, there are also areas where you go outside to see the penguins and other birds, there are tanks that you can see in the top of and then later see inside on the lower levels. And there were so many different species. I would suggest you need at least 2 but more likely 3 hours to fully experience the place. When visiting Lisbon, definitely go here whoever you are!"

With a focus on conservation efforts, this is an amazing way to be awed and educated at the same time. Definitely worth the price. Advice: go to their website and purchase tickets directly. You don't have to choose a specific date as it is good for 120 days after the purchase date leaving you with a good window of time and flexibility on your trip.

My girlfriend and I popped in to the Oceanarium on the way back to the airport, because it had such high ratings on this site that we felt we should see what the fuss was about, but to me it seemed like a pretty standard aquarium. One big tank with lots of fish circling aimlessly for their entire lives, then a load of specialised smaller tanks around the outside for the more antisocial animals, including the ever-shy octopus which every aquarium in the world seems to have but nobody ever sees.We went on a Sunday afternoon which in retrospect was an obvious mistake due to the sheer number of excited (noisy, pushy) kids.Highlights included the otters, puffins, sunfish and giant crabs - but as with all of these types of exhibits, the sense of wonder is tinged with sadness at imprisoned creatures who are not in their natural habitat. At least this aquarium seems to be emphasising the environmental issues facing the world, with lots of information on how much destruction we are causing to the underwater ecosystem."

In fact the only mammals I did see was two 'very happy' sea otters.  It's a very well thought out 'oceanarium', very clean & safe for us human while also and more importantly very close to the environment for the sea life and birds it enclosed, with ice and real growing plants. Great for adults and kids, also you get the environmental message.  Again as mentioned before there's the temporary exhibition by Takashi Amano's, do go to it because it's just wonderful to sit and watch, lose yourself into water-weeds and fish.... Again, part of an environmental message, and an important one. What a shame he died so young, but what a message he left."

In fact I had already read many reviews and seen some TV shows on the beautiful place so that when the chance has finally arisen off I went to at long last catch up with it. But I was quite unimpressed with the facility, it is certainly a pleasant one and one can see that everything is well kept. But it is definitely miles away from the best in the world. An average attraction, needs some investment to enhance its strengths and cure some weaknesses (a lack of variety and some startling absences) in order to rank with the best. The location is outstanding, though."

My partner and I spent over an hour searching for this aquarium after coming out of the nearby shopping mall. I suggest researching what the outside looks like before you go so you know what you're looking for. We wandered around with an older couple for a while, following sign posts that lead us near the sea and the walk along the prom, but not near the actual aquarium. The aquarium basically has one big circular tank in it, that you walk around and see from all different angles, with a few smaller separate tanks. It's a magnificent building and was worth the money. I love aquariums and had a nice afternoon out. There is disabled access, lockers (for a euro, if you don't want to carry your bag) and a cafe. Although we had a lovely time I must say the Blue Planet Aquarium near Chester, In the UK is a much better day out! I'd recommend going to the one in Lisbon if you're looking for something to do, it's suitable for all ages."

There were lots of members of staff dotted around who repeatedly had to tell tourists to stop using flash on their cameras (everyone was told when they came in not to use flash as some of the fish are from deep in the ocean and light is damaging). It's amazing how ignorant people can be but good to see staff stopping them. My favourite exhibits were the sea otters, dragon fish and jelly fish. We ate in the canteen and had a really nice meat pasta dish. Definitely worth the entrance fee and only a short walk from the tube station and shopping arcade."

All types of fish are here, just as some sea otters, pinquins, frogs and birds. This oceanarium is darker inside than most, which made us stumble against walls. So pay attention when walking around. Altough we've seen quite some oceanariums, this one is quite nice mainly because of it's setup. It's worth going to. At the entrance you can pay for a ticket to go the 'permanent' or 'permanent + temporary exhibit'. We've only been to the permanent exhibit, it that was enough since it took a few hours to see, after that we were quite done with the fishies."

Incredible array of sea life and the huge tank in the middle is just awesome. Love that we get different views of it as we walk thru, along with great additions like sea otters and penguins. If you only see one thing in Lisbon, go here."

We spent 4+ hours inside, wowing in front of all exhibits and taking hundreds of pictures and videos. What's more, it seemed all guests were in this excited state, whether they were 5years old, 35 y.o. or 70+. The entire establishment was very clean, well structured to flow the visitors without crowding places and overall a cool getaway from the scorching Portuguese summer outside. The coffee places in and around the Oceanarium seemed a bit overpriced, but that's a really minor detail. Should you ever visit Lisbon, the oceanarium is definitely a must see!"

            "review": "One of the highlights of a trip to Lisbon. Went with my daughter and we both thought it was wonderful. We were overwhelmed by how much there was to see. We particularly enjoyed the central deep aquarium home to tuna, sun fish, sea otters, sharks and many other types of fish. We also liked the miniature sea worlds with different climates that had been created in a circle around the main aquarium and the beautiful tanks of jelly fish moving gracefully up and down - my daughter captured these on video - they look like they have been choreographed. If you like the natural world and want to see close up sea creatures that would be hard to see in the wild this is highly recommended. Its very popular in the holiday season so go early to avoid queues for tickets and a very crowded experience (we went at peak time!). We stopped off in the cafe on the way out and that was good too. Easy to get to on public transport. Its not cheap but it is value for money. So i would go for half a day and see everything including the videos. We also went to the temporary exhibition by a japanese artist who makes underwater worlds - it was okay but not amazing like the aquarium. This must be one of the best aquariums in the world. Its also very accessible for people in wheel chairs, children in buggys but i would avoid crowded times if you are slow on foot or use a stick. If you are taking small children just bear in mind there is a lot to see and they will probably have had enough earlier than their parents / older siblings and that its also visually very intense/overwhelming and possibly frightening for some children. There is a not very nice parade of cafes just outside the oceanarium selling by portuguese standards quite junky foods like icecreams with zillions of sugary toppings. The cafe inside is better value for money, quite large and sells better food/drinks."

Set out in different ocean sections. Lots to see loved the two cute otters. Also saw puffins really close up and the endangerared Australian Weedy Sea Dragon. They have a short film about the aquarium which is well worth viewing gives insight into what your entrance fee goes to very informative. Despite it being busy just take your time the crowds ebb and flow in fact found it very relaxing. Spent a good two and half hours looking around. Def worth entrance feeOutside there are plenty of places to eat and drink. Set in a nice walking area."

It was on our list of things to do, and the bus took us almost to the door, although it can also be reached on the red metro line (oriente).Upon arriving I was glad we had pre-paid the ticket as the queues were long. We headed for the entrance and were taken to a side office and given our tickets, skipping the queue and heading in almost immediately. First stop was the restaurant for a drink and Nata before we tackled the main tanks, good Nata but already we could see this was a very school child oriented place by he large group having lunch. As we expected the main oceanarium was packed with visitors, with large groups of kids and plenty families and couples. We shuffled around each of the exhibits and if you hang around long enough and let the groups pass you can then enjoy the tanks and displays in peace before the next group arrives .We initially missed the sea otters but headed back to where they were signposted and were lucky enough to see then come out and swim by... A lovely site but over very quickly. We hung around for a good 20 mins but only saw them swim out a few times and each time it was once around the small tank and then back under the rocks. Still a beautiful site and again worth hanging around for a quieter time to see these wonderful animals up close.We spent a good couple of hours wandering and enjoying both the permanent large tanks and the temporary exhibit of the underwater forest. Although it was very busy we were still able to see everything up close and enjoyed our visit. Worth taking the cable car over the expo park after your trip, we got off at the other end and had a lovely lunch in one of the many restaurants."

It was a change from the sightseeing we had been doing. There is a cafe in the oceanarium that offers basic menu at reasonable prices. I would recommend families with children to visit."

Just enough written information to take in some interesting facts about the animals on display.Top tip is to book tickets in advance online and print out. This meant we walked straight in to the Oceanarium without queuing.On site cafes and restaurants are good value.A great place to visit with all ages, especially with a cable car trip too."

It was really fabulous how everything was exhibited and explained. Really informative and interesting as well as magnificent main aquarium with large array of fish, from tropical reef fish to open Ocean fish. really amazing! Outside the whole area is worth a walk around as the modern architecture in some parts is really grabbing! Also had large shopping centre attached which was fun for a bit of retail therapy latter before heading back. Definitely put a part of a 3 plus day itinerary."

The aquarium is basically one bigger tank (mediocore size compared to the ones in Singapore and Barcelona) surrounded by nearly household size aquariums. There were also two open pond-like rooms for penguins and otters. One guest got bird feces on her from the other birds flying around in the penguin area. The extra exhibit was a 4 minute walk-through.The area around the aquarium had also seen its best days and was somewhat sad to stroll around."

However, the Oceanarium came so highly recommended that we sacrificed a few hours of sunshine. Set in the Expo park, with free parking, the Oceanarium is an impressive building. Entertainers have been employed to amuse those queuing for tickets, and when we arrived the queue was very long, but we were paid and through after less than 20 minutes of beach-ball football. The fee was 36Euro for a family of 4, with children under 12.When we walked into the first room of the Oceanarium we were greeted by a giant tank filled with sharks, rays and many more varieties of sea life. The tank is the depth of the building and is designed to give a realistic understanding of ocean life; the ground floor is at sea-bed level and each floor provides a view of the fish that live at that level of the sea. The whole building wraps around the tank so it can be seen throughout your visit.The site is split into different areas depicting the seas and oceans and the wildlife that live next to them - there are even penguins and sea birds. The children were constantly discovering a new wonder and they visited every exhibit without any coaxing to carry on a little bit longer. My only - perhaps obvious - observation would be that due to the numbers of people there were queues to get to look at all of the displays and as it is quite dark in some areas, the children felt a little unsettled.Overall, this was a brilliant attraction and good value for money."

I think you can guess what this attraction is going to be, if you have ever been to a Sea life centre or large Aquarium then you won't be surprised or disappointed. As a family we enjoyed this and wiled away a pleasant few hours here. My particular favourite was the room with the penguins, this was a large rocky are with frozen sections housing not only penguins but a large collection of birds which occasionally flew (quite closely) over head. Watching the birds interact and totally ignore the tourists was quite relaxing and entertaining and the ice kept the room nicely chilled which was welcome in the 35degree heat outside. As an aside the little canteen was quite reasonable as well for drinks and meals with a set menu for lunch if you wanted. Would recommend booking online because you get 10% discount and avoid any queue at the entrance. You just show the tickets on your phone so you don't need to print anything off"

Around it, on the corners you will see different expositions with small fishes, jellys, frogs, seahorses...Overall it's a good experience, but the price might be too high.

It contains a HUGE reservoir where you can see amazing fish and sea life that we had never seen before. Around it, reproduction of 4 Oceans where their flore and animal life is recreated. A real beauty to see. We have amazing pictures of fish and plants. Tons of very insightful information about the Oceans, their animal life and their preservation. We loved the fact that this Center was recreated to inform us about Oceans, and educate us to preserve them by changing our life habits. A MUST see if you are in Lisbon!

The temporary exhibition was the world's largest aquarium by a Japanese aquarium architect and was interesting. One of the benefits of this aquarium is they're really passionate about educating visitors about the state of the ecological system in the world and if you take the time to read the species and area descriptions you can learn a lot.Seeing the sharks, manta rays, huge fish and all was really cool. Downside (inevitable) of the trip was kids running all over the place and being completely oblivious about adults walking around given there are some dark areas as you work your way through all the sections of the aquarium.Tip: There's a bus from Cais de Sodre (among other stops including Santa Apolonia) that drops you off a 2 minute walk to the aquarium - not hard to get to at all given the stop is named after the aquarium. Also, if you can buy your tickets online to avoid the queue."

My favourites were definitely the sea otters, I could have stayed there all day to watch them play!"

Lisbon Oceanarium is probably the highlight of our two-week long stay in the city.It was reasonably priced, compared to other European tourist attractions, and very easily accessible from the nearby Metro station.The cafeteria was good and ideal for a drink midway or after you've completed your journey around the Oceanarium, which itself offers displays of exotic fish and ocean life.We loved the otters and the giant tank in the middle, which acts as a centrepiece.Very popular with children, the Oceanarium is enlightening with signs in a variety of languages to make sure all tourists understand and can learn more about the wonderful creatures."

The large main tank was very big with many viewing windows on two levels it seemed to be a centre point with many other attractions around it. It had sharks, stingray, and very large ocean sunfish that I'd never seen before. They had a good selection on jelly fish, Octopi. They also had penguins in a nice cool rocky area no snow. They had sea otter and a rainforest with many species of coloured poisonous and non poisonous little frogs, really pretty.I think this place which has many other things that I haven't mentioned, is well worth a visit, families and children of all ages will be fascinated and encouraged to enjoy and protect our treasured wildlife."

Even the architecture is impressive. It is separated to different oceans of the world and the variety of fish in each. A massive aquarium in the middle mimicking the vast seas.There is plenty of room to view and take photos (no flash!) even at a busy Sunday. I think it's a very educational experience as the kids kept talking about what they've seen and asking more questions for days.The oceanarium is wheelchair and stroller accessible. Restrooms were spot clean.And.. It's cheap compared to other oceanariums I've been to. 46\u20ac for a family ticket (2 adults, 2 children). Baby was free (<3)."

The Oceanarium won. It was, indeed, considerably cooler than anything else we could do with 2 seniors, 2 adults, and 2 children in tow. There were a lot of fun exhibits: the puffins and otters are memorable. However, the biggest concern that ALL six of us noted is the lack of adequate lighting. This aquarium is dark, really dark inside. I bumped into a few people's feet because I couldn't see them. Yes, the aquatic environments are lit but the rest of the place appears to be in a blackout.Also, signage is lacking. This was seen continually throughout the country so may be less of an Oceanarium thing but more of a country-specific concern. Finding the WC within the building required finding an employee (not an easy task, maybe it was just really busy that day?) and asking. When they direct you to the WC, it is a single room so there is inevitably a line of 12 people ahead of you. Fine...I head on to the next WC which yields the same issue. My advice is to use the WC on the lower level near the gift shop. There is likely a line but there are numerous stalls so it should go quickly.We were able to spend about 2-2.5 hours there which fit the bill but some easy improvements could be made to make it better."

The main event is a classic large pool in the middle with your mapped out around the edge, plus some other tanks on outer walls. It takes you through the different oceans and is really interesting. If you actually stop and read the signs (all in English and Portuguese) it makes it a lot better and about half way round down stairs there is a very informative DVD run which tells you loads about behind the scenes which is so interesting and puts a lot into context about how they create and control the environment within the tank itself, which is pretty amazing. They grow they're own life effectively. The coral reef is amazing and so colourful and the Sharks, sun fish ( weirdest looking thing!) and jellyfish are just beautiful.Have read a few reviews that state it's not very organised or informative.

Even though it was crowded, we still saw everything easily and moved through the buildings easily. The temporary exhibit \"Forests Underwater\" by Takeshi Amano was amazingly beautiful and not to be missed.

The main tank is enormous and contains a wide variety of fascinating aquatic creatures. There is information on most of the species available in both English and Portuguese. The attraction was quite crowded mid-afternoon on a Friday in July, but that's probably to be expected. The crowds and time to wait get a good view of the exhibits probably increased the amount of time we spent there. The location is not central to the main tourist area, about a 8 Euro cab ride away from Restaudores Square.All in all, it was a good time for our group of 12 between 9 month and 63. Would recommend for groups with kids or those with plenty of time to explore Portugal. I'm not sure if I would plan into a trip if time in the area is limited."

The nearest metro stop is Oriente, from there it's a 10 minutes walk to the aquarium. You can also take the cable car (Telecabine Lisboa) from Passeio das T\u00e1gides (North Station) to the Aquarium (South Station).Tickets can be bought from the Aquariums homepage, which is recommendable in several ways.Firstly because you circumvent the ticket booth lines, secondly because the ticket is valid for a period, i.e. you do not have to plan a specific day, but can go any day of the period where the ticket is valid - this does of cause not entitle you to more than one visit.The displays are stunning and well designed, you can valk around the entire centre tank and see the animals from many different angles. Actually the Aquarium is quite big - we used about 3 hours there, including much needed stop in the small movie theater showing a movie of the Aquarium behind the curtains - quite interesting.The kids were absolutely stunned by the two sea otters, which are almost unbearable cute, spending almost half an hour there.Aside of the main Aquarium, there are many more displays with inverterbrae, amphibians and plants.The Aquarium shop is quite nice and well stocked - worth a short visit as well.All in all the Aquarium is highly recommendable!"

The only complaints that I found the organization a bit strange and not all animals in a tank were described.The temporary exhibit, which has been there for a while, is worth a trip by itself! Takashi Amano (d. 2015) is a water landscape artist. He designed and built a 40-meter zen aquascape. It is a meditative piece, an ikebana in the water. I so enjoyed the use of space, shape, and color. There are hundreds of fish in the exhibit, though they are all small. cardinal tetras, rasboras, and other small new world fish.

The huge reservoir in the center has sharks, Rays, sunfish and other species that can keep you attached to the glass. Interesting side rooms have penguins, sea otter and other animals that will be a lovely sight for kids. Overall worth to go if passing by."

Lisbon Oceanarium is without a doubt one of the best Oceanariums that I have visited, and I have seen quite a few around the world :) The current temporary exhibition, Forests Underwater - the world's biggest planted aquarium, created by a team of many aquascapers from all over the world under the leadership of, in the meantime deceased, Takashi Amano (this is his latest major project) - is magnificent! I recommend visitors to take their time and to observe from the several seats available this amazing aquarium. The main building of the Oceanarium has a recommended tour which allows to see the main central tank from different sides, which seems like completely different aquariums. A few hours of fun are guaranteed at the Lisbon Oceanarium."

            "review": "Excellent introductory site, but tad overrated. .Background: As part of a three-week train-and-hotel tour of Portugal and Spain, I had sought out this attraction while in Lisbon. It had been built for the Expo '98 for the host country of Portugal.PROS: Proximity to the city centre is its best feature. About a 5-min drive from the airport, it is within walking distance from the Metro Oriente station as well as the Comboio Oriente train station. Designed to look like an aircraft carrier from the outside, the 3-storey building has a long walkway ramp that spirals around a massive central tank. This centerpiece tank holds a variety of pelagic fish, sharks, mantas, rays and a fine specimen of Mola Mola (ocean sunfish). Here and there are sitting areas to view the tank from any angle. Around the main tank are smaller exhibits that represent different biomes (not all) of the world. I applaud their focus on marine conservation. Open daily from 10:00 am, entry costs \u20ac15.30 per adult, and \u20ac9.90 for a child (4-12 yr old) but will require proof of age. If you hate lining up, there are a couple of ticket machines on the side that take credit cards. (There's also a 10% discount for online tickets, which assures fast entry with no queues.) Because it is an indoor oceanarium, it is perfect for a rainy outing.CONS: A few come to mind -- First, for its size, there isn't much variety. Seriously. I do understand that you can only hold as many animals in one place. Still, even my humble 180-gallon coral reef aquarium has more variety. (I counted.) Second, there isn't much displayed information around the individual exhibits themselves. Third, it may be unintentional, but there are some subtle misinformation surrounding some of the exhibits. For example, displaying small-polyped stony (SPS) corals -- albeit fake ones -- along the littoral zone of a mangrove swamp simply gives the wrong impression. Lastly, for what it's worth, the place is overpriced.Reality check: With all due respect, I would hazard a guess that most superlatives come from reviewers who are relatively new to marine life or public aquariums or both. How many have visited the aquariums at Georgia (US), Monterey Bay (US), Dubai, Okinawa, Valencia (Spain), Turkuazoo (Turkey), Singapore, Vancouver (Canada) or Osaka (Japan)? Having visited all but Dubai and Turkey, I do have the 20/20 insight for a side-by-side comparison. I fear this site is a beneficiary of the \"bandwagon effect\"? Don't get me wrong. If you've never been to a public aquarium, you're in for a special treat!Verdict: Caveat aside, suffice it to say that Lisboa Oceanarium is an excellent introductory place to see and experience marine life. But from the perspective of a marine biologist, I can understand how it can be a bit underwhelming to others who've visited other places. It is slightly overrated by TA compared to what is available elsewhere. I would not go so far as to say it's the #1 aquarium, but it's in my Top 3. Recommended. Grade A-minus.."

It has one enormous tank centrally that holds sunfish and a manta ray as rarest species. In the 2 floors some outside habitats nicely match with bigger animals like penguins, otters,... The remarkable thing is that with the otters life fish co exist. And if you see the Penguins, they are enjoying their space, swimming pool and even fake but cold ice. A part from these there are several other thanks showcasing special fish like even cuttlefish and a decent size octopus. Also the area around is really nice. From the expo in the 80's including a still operating cable car. Getting there is easy by metro but also taxis are not expensive in Lisbon. Ticket line can be long, but machines around the corner will allow you to book and print and you don't need to queue. Last detail temperature is cool in the building which makes this a great trip at the hottest part of the day in summer to get your kids out of the sun during the hottest part of the day."

It is great when you don\u00b4t have anything planned and just want to chill-out. Check prices first and see discounts, it is not the cheapest place in the world :)."

In between the different view points you can visit other exhibits that include penguins, otters and smaller reptiles. Also the temporary exhibition of underwater forests is very worth seeing.

Indeed the museum is one of most interesting of sealife I ve seen. One is in Bodrum/Turkey which is much different with relics of ancient civilizations from under water. This one is so different, like the Monterey Aquarium by Pasific and sea museum in Hong Kong. You feel you are in a different universe totally with all those different species and flora living under the water. It has habitat from all oceans of the World and all are connected by canals to one ocean like it is actually on earth."

Small compared to some other similar attractions but a great way to spend an enjoyable couple of hours.The full price is a little over 15 euros which is pretty good value but we got in cheap as we bought a hop on hop off bus tour ticket which incorporated entry to the Oceanarium. The only issue with this is that nobody told us that we would have to queue up to swap our vouchers for tickets so we did not save any time.The attraction centers around a large tank containing several species of large and small fish plus Sea Otters. There are several viewing points spread over three floors including a view above the surface where we could see the Sea Otters. There are several other displays of smaller species.A secure area where bags can be left whilst you explore could be useful to some. The only down side was that the only caf\u00e9 was at the exit and as we arrived after mid-day, we were really hungry by the time we left.As a bonus (nothing really to do with the Oceanarium), as we sat in the caf\u00e9, we watched an air display that was going on."

You can see the roof set back from the pedestrian walkway. the entrance fee is a steep 17 Euros, but it is worth it. When you go in, everyone is crowded around the main tank taking pictures of the fish on their phones. Keep walking because you can see this same tank from many other angles, with fewer people around. There is one main tank and many side exhibitions. the highlight is the pair of otters, and the film tells you all about them. The film is very good, in Portuguese but subtitled in various languages. The translation is faultless. This is one of those places where you have to exist through the gift shop, but it's not too tempting because there is not much to bu - unless you really like nice mugs. I do not need another mug! I did not eat at the Oceanarium, where there seem to be chains of restaurants attached to the premises. Instead wander back to the mall and on the ground floor is a huge supermarket, with a great deli at the back. You can get hot food for as little as 4 Euros and eat it on the benches overlooking the water."

The part with the coral reef of course deserves a stop, so the sea horses that have been recently added in a column shaped aquarium. It's really a must go, especially with kids.

TLDR: It's mostly fun but some exhibits seem inappropriate and potentially harmful, and there is little information on display.While it's always fun to look at the different fish and other animals the aquarium has to offer, there isn't really much information around about the fish exhibited. There is a central tank with loads to look at, I found myself learning little to nothing new about the fish at all. Some of the smaller tanks only include the name of the species. Now, if you're concerned about the well-beings of the animals rather than only the enjoyment of the guests, there are points the aquarium should certainly look into. Even though the staff are caring and the biologists working for the aquarium so their best to keep the animals happy and healthy, some exhibits do seem kind of improper. For instance, the penguin exhibit where guests can literally stretch their hands and interact with them, was an unpleasant surprise. While toddlers and some adults may find it fun to be able to pet a penguin or bird (cause they had birds freely roaming the room), not only they but also the animals too could get hurt. A malicious person could get an animal poisoned or even killed relatively easily! The otter exhibit was also open, so people would easily be able to pollute the water or harm the animals. Not to mention, having the animals directly interact with humans and human food is highly unnatural. In the end, the aquarium experience was rather enjoyable, but the constant thought of the animals possibly getting hurt and the lacking information display, kept it far from being excellent. "

The tank is awesome with really cool fishes and I like that there are niches throughout you can sit and watch the fishes. The place is well organized into ocean categories. Love the \"forest under water\" temporary exhibit. Having said that it is just another nice aquarium similar to Monterey in California, Dallas aquarium (and tropical forest/garden). Not sure why this is the number one attraction in Lisbon because this does not have any cultural significance other than the fact that Portugal is on the coast."

Don't walk in and spend ages trying to view it from the first window (as everyone does), there are two levels, each with a dozen areas to look through at the myriad of fish, sharks and rays swimming around in this truly vast tank. The penguins are lovely in their own little habitat. If you are lucky enough to see the sea otters have your camera ready - they are too cute for words. I actually enjoyed the waterfront area its set in too. Nice walk from the train station (just over 10 mins), through the shopping area and turn right when you get to the waterfront, easy."

The great attraction are the penguins and otters (those that existed at the opening - Amalia and Eusebius, have died) and feeding times of mammals and fish. The only caveat to make is that there is no news in terms of new attractions (animals, exhibits or new circuits) so that those who visit this Oceanarium several times, do not always find it the same charm."

The Oceanarium provided a cool, entertaining and fun way to spend an hour or two. The displays were fun for the kids, and lots of sea life to behold, almost 8000 species of life to be viewed here from all the worlds oceans. The huge Sunfish was quite something to see. As for an aquarium it was ok, but nothing super spectacular. The kids loved it, we found the cool interior a relief. The restaurant had one good meal, the fish. Lol. The chicken and pasta wasn't to write home about. But the eating space was comfortable, with selection of cool beverages and desserts to choose from. The gift shop had some really cool stuff, pricy but cool. This doesn't make my top 10 in Lisbon, but it was an enjoyable and relaxing experience with the kids. Go check it out."

We have been to a similar display but there were at least 2 underwater divers in the tank feeding & interating with the sea life unlike here. The print on the displays was very difficult to read due to the poor lighting & the font size."

When I looked around for attractions to visit in Lisbon, this was honestly - in my backup list just in case I have some extra time, and definitely - I am glad I did and was astoundingly surprised on how good it was!From the moment you enter the aquarium area, to the exploration of the tanks etc, it is indeed a multi sensory experience that is unseen of in other aquariums. Yes, it could be smaller than some well-renowned aquariums but definitely trust me, this is the best, if not - one of the best.You'll be rewarded with a grand overview of the sea life ecosystem (have you watched Finding Dory yet?) - all the seawater aquariums are linked in some way to the main central aquarium to give a sense of how fishes and other sea creatures lead their lives in sea (to illustrate how the different grand seas on earth counterbalances each other).Definitely worth a visit, and should be in the top of the list of all travelers to Lisbon!"

The central tank is absolutely enormous and seeing the sun fish was amazing. My daughter loved the rays (and sharks of course) and took great delight having spotted some regal tangs (Dorys!) and clownfish (Nemos!) in the tropical reef section. One of my favorites was the enclosure with the puffins and muerres - watching them diving from an underwater perspective was fascinating. There was also a penguin enclosure and sea otters as well as the more usual amphibians, jellyfish etc. There is also a well designed section near the end on the importance of environmental protection and conservation with lots of interactive elements to engage kids. The only thing I think which might have added to the experience was a little more information on the species but all in all a fantastic morning / afternoon out for all ages!"

The tanks and displays were very high quality, and everything was in both Portuguese and English. My only issue was that none of the exhibits listed all of the animals that were present in the tank. The tanks in the amphibian area had no labels at all, and in the general fish areas, there was, for example, a tank with labels for 3 different species of eels, but not mention of the lionfish that were also in the tank. Overall, the aquarium had a really strong and well-presented conservation message, but could have been even a better teaching tool if it named everything you were seeing."

Parking is easy and it is only 5/10 minutes drive from the airport, so if you have a late flight and are not sure what to do to kill the time before your flight - then this is the place to go. You can either check in your luggage or leave it at Left Luggage and take a taxi to the oceanarium & book a return to the airport to coincide with your flight. The oceanarium is fascinating, beautiful and educational and appealing to all ages. It's also very relaxing. The enormous tanks seem to be connected but are in fact separate to accommodate the needs of the different fish species. The whole effect is spectacular."

The temporary exhibition was created by a Japanese artist and it was very beautiful. It contained a great variety of plants, rock and fish.However, the best was yet to come. The main aquarium was the largest I have ever seen. There are two floors to view it from and it is 360 degrees. The incredible variety of fish, sharks, stingrays, schools of fish made every viewpoint new and exciting. As you slowly circle the tank (and let me say that this is no SMALL tank and will take you on a wonderful journey) there are many side tanks and displays for fish from around the world. There is a large arctic display which is covered with a glass roof and has penguins. There is another room with large sea otters. You can sit on benches in viewing areas for the large aquarium or just sit on the floor in front of the glass and watch the sea life swim right past you. Some viewpoints show you \"behind the rocks\" areas where some fish enjoy the safety from the large open water.This bears repeating. The Lisbon Oceanario should be on your must see list. It is absolutely spectacular and well worth the low cost of admission."

It seems as he has a way too small tank and you could see, that he was already hurt at the top of his head because he was hitting the glass everytime he tries to swim.

In our case it was about tropical plants- it included one room with few stuff and I can definitely saw it wasn't worth it. Overall it has rare and diverse species but the presentation could've been better - the tunnel from the Barcelona aquarium, the landscape arrangement from Munster Zoo.

During that time I had an occassion to see temporary exhibition of freshwater aquarium designed by Takashi Amano (I think it was one of the last from His masterpieces) and I have no idea if it is still there. But it was definitely great aquarium (see photos). Going further, You can admire one of the biggest tanks with ocean animals in the world. You have two levels for observation. In fact it is possible to observe popular species as well as rare fishes like Sunfishes (Mola mola) or Mantas. I have heard that this tank has about 5 million liters of water - it is absolutely giantic. Nevertheless, You can also observe other tanks and installations with otters, penguins, jellyfishes, squids, shrimps, etc.I can recommend this attraction for everyone interested in marine fauna and flora. being a little bit bored observing those in typical zoological gardens. Comparing to other oceanaria I saw (like in Loro Park in Tenerife or Dalian Oceanarium in China) this one is much better.You need at least three hours to see it."

There is plenty of space to see everything so if one window is blocked with tourists, go to the next one or the next one or the next one. The place is not a mace and you can't get lost and you don't have to wonder if you've already seen something. The otters and the penguins are placed so that you will first see them from the surface and then later from below as they dive. I thought that was really, really smart. All tanks seem spacious and you don't get the anxious feeling of 'are the animals happy'. We liked this place a lot and definitely recommend it for even those who are not traveling with children."

Viewing angles are extraordinary and I was privy to a special exhibit by Takahi Amano on underwater gardens! What a special treat!My only critique is that they have to do much better in managing volume to enter. I purchased my entry tickets on-line, then still had to line-up with everyone else to pick-up my physical ticket!!! The on-line purchase saved me nothing!Oceanario Management!!!! - When the voucher comes to my mobile from an on-line purchase, that should be good to proceed straight to the entry gate, not to have to line-up with everyone else purchasing on-site!!!

On the top floor, you see inside the aquarium near the top, and around it, are above-ground type exhibits, like the puffins, penguins and otters. We were lucky enough to catch the otters at feeding time and watched the two of them gobble up a giant pail of fish and mussels. I think they may mostly hide otherwise. On the bottom ring, you see much farther below the surface of the big tank as well as a whole bunch of other exhibits, like jellyfish, crustaceans and other creatures in smaller tanks. We went on an early Monday afternoon, between school groups so it was very quiet. Highly recommend doing this is if you can."

For all of you animal lovers and marine biology enthusiasts out there, you'll absolutely love this place.Being Europe's largest aquarium/oceanarium, its main tank is quite impressive. First of all, it is huge to say the least. You can view it from all sides and on both the upper and lower levels. I'm not quite savvy on the nomenclature of marine life but the tank had many varieties of sharks, stingrays, manta rays and fish.At the same time, you get to visit different areas of the oceanarium, each representing different oceans and climates.Everybody was amused with the otters, gently swimming of their backs and rubbing their eyes and whiskers with their front \"paws\".Another area we enjoyed is the dimly-lit section where you can observe the jellyfish. They practically glow in their tanks.We also saw many other creatures we never knew existed.If you're visiting Portugal for the first time, you're probably not thinking if visiting an aquarium. But I highly recommend you include it in your travel plans, as you can also visit the neighboring Parque das Na\u00e7oes (Nations Park), site of the 1998 world expo. A most modern area of Lisbon, in terms of architecture. It's located close to the airport so you can easily go after arriving or before departing LIS."

Kids would like the giant sea animals \"drawn\" on the plaza with the black and white stone paving typical of Lisbon..We like these giant aquariums and accept that the format is pretty standard. This one is at the better end of the spectrum. Inside there was plenty of English information available. The central tank had a varied selection of viewing points, some with seating, some very small . There was the opportunity to watch a film about conservation half way round. The sharks and rays are always interesting, but there was a good variety of other fish to enjoy too. The penguins had a large enclose to themselves. The otters had there own pool. We may have missed it but we didn't see an underwater viewing point for the otters. I always like the sea horses and sea dragons. Hard to believe they are real.All the kids there seemed to be having a good time.Took us about 2 hours to go round but no one hurried us and we could have spent longer.

We went here on Saturday morning and there were a lot of people, making it hard to look at aquariums when you have 10 to 20 people standing in front of them. Try to avoid busy periods like the weekend.Overall, it was ok. As a comparison, I was at Kelly Tarlton's Aquarium in New Zealand and felt that this one in Lisbon was not as good as that one.The selection of animals was good and interesting.We went to the restaurant afterwards, but the food wasn't really that tasty, you are probably better of going to another restaurant nearby.Also, I went to purchase tickets on the machine, waited in line for 5-10 minutes, but it only offered the permanent+temporary exhibition, but we only wanted the permanent exhibition, which is 3EUR cheaper per person, but this option was not available on the machine and had to go and stand in line for the ticket from the ticket counter. I don't think that it's right to force people to have to buy the more expensive ticket if they go to the ticket machine."

And then on the upper floor (there are 2) there are 4 seperate areas all dedicated to a different climatic zone. For example there is an arctic zone where u can see penguins or there is a tropical zone with a small forest. And on the lower level u can see the fish of all those areas and also a few other aquariums. All in all a really nice and memorable experience!"

We appreciated the educational aspect of current environmental risks to our oceans and what that might mean for our future. It's also worth watching the film at the cinema-like area near the end.

It was a bad weather day in Lisbon when we visited and seemed like we were there with the rest of Lisbon, long lines and big crowds. Despite this we had a fun day. All the exhibits/aquariums were interesting. We were glad we packed a lunch as the cafeteria food did not look very good (in fairness we did not try anything from the cafeteria). We took a taxi from Lisbon but having taken the subway there, would recommend taking the subway, it's very easy and the metro station (called Oriente) is very close to the Oceanarium. Overall, would highly recommend the second largest aquarium in Europe - especially if you have kids!"

Initially, we thought it will be amazing after visiting oceanarium in Valencia, but it has less collection and not worth for what you pay. But its worth to take a cable car ride from just opposite of oceanarium and ride for 5 min. It will cost about 5 euros round trip, but you will have amazing pictures of the longest bridge in Europe over the sea. The oceanarium is easy to access by public transport by taking Metro from Cais so sodre towards Teheiras ( Green line) and get down at Alameda and take the metro towards Aeroporto and get down at cabo ruievo. Then walk for 10 min."

Experiencing these fascinating creatures up close was a thrilling experience - in the most positive way. And by close, I mean a few inches, sometimes even less!You'll see all kinds of fish, clamps, crabs, sea horses, etc. of varying sizes. Some being unbelievably enormous!The building has a very clever structure. In the middle there is a huge fish-tank. You can peek inside through large windows from many sides. So don't worry if there is a crowd, just walk a few more steps and you will surely find another window.Inside you will see sharks, rays, mantas, even sun-fish which are the largest and heaviest fish in the world! (White sharks and whales count as mammals, y'know but you don't get to see them here ;) )You can find more spectecular sea-life on the corridors circling around the big fish-tank on two levels. There are species even from tropical rain forests. So you get much more then \"just\" the ocean.Spend a few minutes in the video room to learn about the every-day operation of the facility. It is amazing to see how much care and effort (and resources) are spent on maintaining the delicate balance of ocean life there. What they do is much more than prociding entertainment for the public. The people operating this facility deserve merit for their work in preserving oceanic life not just within the facility but also out in the ocean!On your way out you have to go through the shop - that's the only way out. :) There are some nice souvenirs there if you don't mind the hefty price.This place well deserves the first place it has earned among the the best locations to visit in Lisbon. (Though the other places are wonderful too! It is easy to fall in love with the whole city!)"

The price of the ticket at \u20ac14 (2015/11) was a bit steeper but the place needs to be maintained and the fish fed so it seems fair.

I have been very much against aquariums and this opposition increased more with my upgoing experience as a professional diver. But this place is actually not bad. It doesn't simply give you the occasion to see and learn about some unusual fish types, besides that, it teaches you about the type of fish and the threatened marine species with significant information. The habitats of species seem quite spacious and very clean. Its atmosphere inside is very special, with a lack of light so that you only focus on the aquariums and the information written. It is one of the biggest aquariums in the world where quite much space is given to species. One thing that me and my boyfriend enjoyed the most, it was the feeding session of the sea otters where the sea otters were given an ice cube with a mussel shell inside the ice and you can observe how they use their paws and the rocks around their habitat in order to break the ice and open the mussel shell. The location of the aquarium might seem a bit outside of the center but you can easily get there and after your visit you should take the cableway and have a view of the longest bridge in Europe."

In a very spacious setting somewhat south of the city centre is this modern, easily accessible, building which houses the aquarium. Centerpiece is a really huge circular basin which can be viewed 360 degrees on two floors. Of course fish are the main attraction, it also provides a 'home' for some shorebased species such a pinguins and several other birdspecies.In smaller tanks one finds the smaller fish which would probably be consumed by the sometimes huge and ferocious looking fish in the main tank.The many 'windows' allowing a view into the tank also help to distribute a large number of spectators throughout the facility. Ours was a very rainy day with many people seeking shelter in a aquatic environment (oh, irony) but we always had a very good view into the tank.Very interesting it was for us adults, fascinating it must be for kids.

And in addition to those spectacular views there are a host of minor tanks showing all sorts of living creatures in the oceans. As long as you don't use flash you may take photos all you like.

The main tank - the main attraction - is huge. MANY different species of aquatic life - and many of each. The entire complex is on two floors, and the central tank can be seen from many different vantage points throughout the two floors, including at least 4 large viewing areas. There are so many displays of countless different types of fish and marine life - it's truly amazing. We spent about 3 hours at the Oceanarium - and could've easily spent more. Our kids are still young, so they actually had seen enough! But every time we turned a corner and saw another type of fish/sea creature, they were in awe again. Our youngest, who is three, just couldn't get enough of the luminescent fish. As many others have, I highly recommend a stop here - it's well worth a visit, and it truly is in a class of its own from a size perspective. Definitely worthwhile!"

Building stays entirely on the Tagus River. If you have some time, I recommend watching the film of creation and maintenance of the whole complex which is surely not easy and is well scientific controlled. Oceanarium tells that they are supporting the protection of the oceans' flora and fauna, hope that it's true. It is simply super attraction and must-see in Lisbon, although one could expect more than 2 floors in the permanent exhibition. There could also be some more English books in the Oceanarium shop on the end of the visit (they are mainly in Portuguese). Recommended especially for families with kids and all nature and especially sea/ocean lovers."

You can easily reach it by Metro, although there is a bit of a walk to the actual location. In itself the oceanarium is quite small and compact, but there's several zones with different animals from different climates. The central tank is the highlight, as its one of the largest single tanks I've seen. There are great views of fish of all sizes, including the Rays and the Sharks. I would recommend this to families with toddlers, older children and teens would (in my opinion) be bored very quickly, but younger children seemed to be genuinely in awe of the huge tank and massive views."

Closed down restaurants, unmaintained parks and rest areas leaves this area really lacking in comparison to some of the more beautiful picturesque areas of Lisbon city. It was quite a rainy day which made the chairlift not very enjoyable - with not much of a view expect for degraded buildings and unfilled water features below. I hope the area is much livelier in another season. The oceanarium itself had a nice range of sea life but there was no real standout in terms of exhibitions or shows to watch.

Be sure to take your time: particularly in the immense central basin with its many windows on two levels there is much to discover. Also do not be disappointed if you do not see the otters at first. The little guys might be sleepy and since they are comfortable with just the head over the water line, they might not be easy to spot. If you find a knackered otter blinking at you it is a particularly adorable sight, though."

And the most striking feature about it is that all of the fish and mammals in there are fed through one water tank. Every thing is linked together and that is the most fascinating feature about this Oceanarium. Make a trip to this place because you will kick yourself if you don't.

Although the price of the ticket is a bit high and the location is a bit far away from the city center, but there is a metro station close that makes the visit of the Oceanarium convenient. As it is part of the former Expo neighbourhood visiting Oceanarium also provides the opportunity to see the other Expo premises; it also worth to spend some time to walk around."

The aquarium is in the Parque das Nacoes and makes for a nice half day or day trip out from the centre of Lisbon (Metro to Oriente). The aquarium itself is a short stroll through the shopping mall and along the river front from the Oriente Metro stop. It's described as the second biggest aquarium in the world (after Monterey) but I am not sure if this refers just to the central main 'tank' spanning two floors and containing the usual array of sharks, rays etc or to the overall size of the aquarium as a whole. I assume the former as when we had walked around the whole aquarium we were quite surprised that we were at the end. There seemed to be relatively few amphibians which I have seen in other aquaria and no 'touch tank' although I am not keen on those as I think it must stress the fish. Having said that it is still a large and varied aquarium and well worth a visit. The incredibly cuddly looking sea otters are a must see. I assume they were bred in captivity as they seemed extremely relaxed and happy to lounge at relatively close proximity to visitors. I was less sure about the penguins and other birds who did not seem to be particularly happy and reminded me why I do not particularly like zoos and animals kept in captivity. Having been round the aquaria the cable car entrance is just outside and worth the short trip to see the view over the Parque, river and up to the Vasco de Gama bridge. The end stop near the Torre Vasco da Gama is about the same distance back to the Oriente metro as the walk from the aquarium."

We have just about had it with aquariums, as the last couple of ones (including the ones in Singapore and Copenhagen) left us tired of places that hardly offer more than a huge tank filled with mantas and sharks. Still, we wanted to give Lisboa a chance, and we are glad we went. The big tank here can be seen from all sides, even offering smaller niche-windows. Room enough for everyone to see. The special habitat tanks are visually connected to the big tank by glass, so at the same time you can see sharks and e.g. diving otters. Well done!"

It's got one massive tank that you can see from different angles, and a sweet but small penguin area; there are a few indoor ponds, an area with some small toads and frogs, a few tanks with jellyfish and other tropical fish but nothing that stands out. There was a poor giant octopus in a tank that was much too small for it, and it kept bouncing off one side and then the other - quite pitiful to watch. The cafe had a poor and overpriced selection (no children's menu!), and the exit is placed at the end of a long ramp, which forces you to go through the shop. Took about an hour to go round. I'd recommend the aquarium in Valencia any time!"

A fantastic facility which clearly intends to give a detailed insight into the ecosystem of the five oceans, with sections dedicated to flora, fauna and life as it quietly flourishes in and around the Water world. Besides its 8000 resident species, it is also an introduction to the sensitivities of interdependence of the plants, corals, invertebrates and an ecology that must be protected for humans to flourish on terra-firma. A must visit for all families who visit Lisbon, besides anyone who has a couple of hours to invest into the vagaries of life in an alien environment, and be enlightened.."

But it was still enjoyable because they had some room to move.Very relaxing and meditative to watch fish in big tanks, so a successful afternoon."

We spend 3:30 walking, learning and seing animals (birds, otters, frogs, fishes ...).It was really interesting, but if you want to enjoy it more, take some earplugs, groups of people and children speak louder and it's resonning; with your earplugs you'll be in your (sea)world."

However, rather than wait in lines we took a chance and checked online - and the tickets came instantly to my email and we could walk straight through and into the aquarium.Inside the aquarium its designed so you are essentially walking in one direction around a beautiful centre tank with countless smaller, specialty tanks on the outside. They have also used lots of big animals where possible, even the jellyfish and octopus were easy to see. The kids loved it because the tanks were accessible and the creatures easy to access.It was really lovely and a life saver in the rain - but would definitely revisit again when the kids are tired of walking around the city..."

There is only one tank in the middle with far too many fish and sharks in it. Not that we could actually see much as people were pushing and shoving to the front. SomeUnruly children were running around and pushing in to other children and generally barging past people with parents no where to be seen. There is no crowd control or tab on numbers of people so whole experience ruined by people using the flash on their cameras and scaring fish, children climbing all over the temporary expedition, rude people with no manners. Otters had the tiniest pool I've ever seen with no stimulation from finding kelp or diving. Their Only distraction was disobedient children banging and screaming near the Glass. Advertised as the best thing in Portugal and conservation work I think not! Totally false advertising the pool/tank is too small and there are no signs or instructions to tell people not to use the flash, bang on glass, climb on sides of exhibits etc. Weren't impressed at all. Went to customer services to find manager, no staff around apart from ticket people who totally ignored me. If manager wads this I am in Portugal till Wednesday if you want to arrange a time so I come and collect a refund. Spoilt my trip to Portugal."

All in all, we spent around 4 hours in there, including a short coffee break at the cafetaria. The Ocean\u00e1rio is one of the largest I've ever seen, and is divided up by ocean. So there's a Pacific part, an Atlantic part, etc. There's also a large central aquarium where all kinds of rays, sharks, fish etc. swim around, including a large 'sunfish'; this was my first time seeing one of those, and it was quite impressive.Besides the permanent aquariums there was also a temporary exhibition, by a Japanese designer. This was a large mangrove-like aquarium, which was very beautiful. The exhibition had information on the kinds of species living in forests, and on forest protection.In general I liked the fact that the Ocean\u00e1rio also gives attention to wildlife preservation, sustainability and other similar topics.All in all this was a very good way to spend an afternoon."

To get back to the oceanarium its 2 stops on the yellow line and a change to the red line (as if back to the airport ) for approx 8 stops; a walk across the road from the Metro and then another walk, it's on the coast; it was pouring down and we were wet through when we arrived; only a small Q; it was easy to follow the route around the different features, we saw lots of large fish and some smaller species also small tanks with quite rare sea life, it was very interesting; all the area's are well kept and there are staff constantly cleaning inside the tanks; I felt a bit sorry for the penguins who only seemed to have a small place to live; they had an ice slide which was good; I suppose they don't know anything else; the mixed large tanks had a great variety from sharks, stingrays, one that was massive and looked like a large oven glove (only description I can think of) you could stand there all day watching them, we spent at least 3 hours; they have a coffee house and serve food; there is also a large shopping center nearby if you need anything; good coffee shops and lovely cakes. We went back on the Metro which is the fastest mode of transport but obviously not the most scenic; having said that; the stations are very clean and nicely tiled; trains are every few minutes and it's easy to negotiate. there are staff at the machines if you need any help."

All the school parties seemed to arrive at the same time and it was truly deafening. Perhaps if they had been staggered it may have been more manageable.

Everything is build around a gigantic central tank which, though, doesn't have very colored fishes. The seals are so very sweet. Overall speaking the place is not very big and they could add more spectacular fishes. Another flaw is that there are no restaurants but only a bar which is a pity. The temporary exhibition was nothing special."

The sea life was in sections of areas/continents, which was very helpful and there was lots of info. The only thing that spoilt it a bit for us was that we were there the same time as a huge school trip so there were lots of screaming kids running around, which prevented us from seeing some of the display - not the centre's fault at all but nonetheless just prevented us from giving 5 stars. Well worth a visit of you like aquariums and there was also a cable car ride across the river, which had great views of the river and bridge."

The aquarium is well organized and can be visited by walking around the main aquarium, with many surrounding smaller ones.Kids always enjoy these visit and even though they don't read and get everything, there is always a little something that catches their attention and stays in mind.It took us about 1 hour 30 to walk around the aquarium with many touch-and-go at various window displays.We ate the restaurant but somehow regretted it after having experienced the much better and enjoyable food in the center on Lisbon's restaurants. It's convenient to have a small snack or drink + fruits or cake (large choice)."

There are plenty of windows and little ones can get right up there and sit and watch for as long as they like. The penguins and otters look delighted with themselves and seem to delight in all the visitors. My daughter enjoyed it so much and she's only 2. She said \"this is so cool\" the whole time. It's really fascinating and such a brilliant experience. I'd highly recommend it. Tickets are 10% cheaper when bought online and there are 3 card machines just outside. It does get busy - a lot more in the afternoon - so can be a little packed. Maybe choose your visiting time for mornings. The Oriente metro is about 10minutes if you're with little ones and not the most beautiful walk. However once you get towards the area it's super nice. They have cobblestone everywhere along the way. I'd highly recommend this to everyone - all the family will enjoy it!"

It was home to thousands of different species and allowed you to see a variety of different things. It was informative and interactive allowing customers to increase there knowledge of the wildlife within. It took us about two hours in total to see everything. If I was to return I would not pay additional for the temporary expedition as it was just a room with some fish tanks in, not particularly informative or specialist in comparison to what we had already seen in the main aquarium. The most spectacular part was the main tank which was the central attraction of the whole aquarium you could see it from any point and it was filled q large variety of fish, sharks, otters, rays etc etc!

To watch the sharks swimming right by your head, the stingrays and all of the other animals in one giant tank was just awesome to watch! Literally spent a lot of time sat there enjoying the view."

The fish from various oceans around the world are great to see too, as are the few sea birds like penguins and it was good to see some of these being fed.Sometimes, it was hard to work out what was on display (for example, the frogs didn't seem to be named). Towards the end, too, the dry heat and darkness made me feel like I had had enough. The restaurant at the end seemed a little expensive with a limited range, so it was good to find the small cafe through the gift shop.

They had fish in there I'd never heard of and the size and variety of species is very impressive. I would post a photo of my favourite one, but it wouldn't convey just how unusual the animal is (and might detract from the surprise if you go there too).There is a main central tank which has numerous viewing points around the building. They also have otters (cuteness factor on overdrive there), a few amphibian and lots of manic penguins.There is a caf\u00e9 just after the entrance where you can get free WiFi. Wear comfortable shoes and if you're using your phone to take photos, make sure you turn the flash off.We were there for 4 hours in total. Money well spent. However, be aware that it's quite a trek from the Metro station (Oriente) so little (or older) legs might get tired. There is a Lot of walking involved. It is very much worth it, though.There is a gift shop there selling the usual kind of thing, including cuddly sharks and stingrays. Because of course."

The tanks are so clean in comparison with other places I visited. The overall atmosphere is very good and it makes you relax.

The special exhibit was some natural environment exhibit that was better for adults than kids (not much to see, but very peaceful) but the main exhibit hall did entertain my kids for a few hours. It's a bit of a trek from the main historic part of Lisbon, about a 15 -20 min cab ride, which cost about $15 dollars, but it was a good way to spend a morning with young kids.

Wherever you are in the building, this will always be on your left and the smaller exhibits on your right. this allows such a close up, uninterrupted view of the fish-sharks, a vast stone fish, rays, a devil fish etc. It also meant that you didnt need to push and shove to seee stuff as it there all the time. there were several parties of small children during our visit and we never had problems viewing. The usual sections according to the Oceans were present with the fish and creatures you would expect, but again very well set out and informative with just the right amount of information. i wasn't too sure about the puffins and whether they should be captive but they were characterful. Of course, the pair of sea otters are a huge attraction and didn't disappoint, drifting around together holding hands, turning somersaults etc.All in all , well worth the money, especially on a rainy day."

Four tanks around the large central tank house four different habitats with their native flora and fauna. The Lisbon Oceanarium is one of the few aquariums in the world to house a sunfish due to their unique and demanding requirements for care. Other interesting species include two large spider crabs and two sea otters named Eus\u00e9bio and Am\u00e1lia, named after two Portuguese contemporary cultural references."

Nice seafood dinner with great staff. you can walk inside the restaurant and see all the fresh food and make your selection from the iced table filled with all types of fish. I saw some of the largest shrimp in fact they were big enough that you could ride them (not Really) They also have some excellent meat dishes for people that prefer that over fish. be sure to order the shrimp in garlic and dip your Portuguese rolls in until it's all goneThe fish is D-boned at the table and fish like Cod and Seabass, which is what we had were lovelyI had the Porkchop. The dinner menu is reasonably priced."

We've been to the one in Baltimore and Monterey and Tampa. Oceanario is better than any of these.It has an enormous central tank with all kinds of fish and side exhibits with many of the world's various environments. We enjoyed the Arctic and Antarctic exhibit the best with its penguins, puffins and Inca terns. The visitors get to walk within the same room as the animals. One tern, for apparently no reason, dive bombed my wife and attempted to hit her with a fish! Missed!

The centerpiece is a large tank of water filled with many varieties of aquatic life, including a couple large sunfish which we (and other people) seemed to enjoy tracking. Around the edges are smaller exhibits featuring specific species of fish or other creatures.I especially enjoyed watching the penguins (you can get closer to them than at most other zoos or aquariums I've been to) and the sea otters, both of whom were very playful and entertaining when I visited.Finally, I would suggest people see the Forests Underwater temporary exhibit while there -- I got it on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. It's the a finely landscaped garden worthy of a grand palace, except in an aquarium. The more time I spent looking at it, the more details I discovered."

We didn't but were able to buy on my mobile phone, took 2 minutes. Not sure why others weren't doing this as well. We spent about 2 hours there and didn't rush but saw it all."

We paid 29\u20ac for 2 persons using Lisboa card, for seeing both temporary and permanent exhibition ( really worth it). You could combine the visit with a walk in parc nacoes and Vasco da gama mall which is 5 min walk away"

Be sure to sit for their 15-minute documentary about halfway through the visit. Puts the collection into context, answers lots of your questions (like, \"why don't they eat each other?\"). Fish of all shapes and sizes, but also aquatic birds (penguins in an icy habitat) and mammals (sea otters lolling on their backs). Really a pleasure, and easy to reach by metro or train (Oriente station on the river)."

Head SE to the water. 2. Buy tickets online prior to going! The lines can be rough and they are a bit cheaper online. 3. Do not use the 1st bathroom upon entering. There are plenty of options later without lines, including one right after you enter the exhibit. 4. The main tank is amazing!! You will want to stare and take pictures the second you see it - as will everyone else. There are literally dozens of places for viewing. Resist the urge and wait for a less busy section so you can truly enjoy the experience. 5. Save time to walk around the immediate area. There is a really nice Boardwalk just outside with a great view!6. And for those of you who need gluten-free . . . There aren't any options (but you already knew this). You may get lucky with a banana, but pack your own."

The sea otters really stole the show, they were gorgeous and very entertaining. There were lockers to store bags away which came in handy and made the visit more comfortable. The cafe seemed very reasonable-we only had drinks and snacks but the food on offer looked and smelt very good. A really good set up, huge tanks, lots of information. A must see-especially for children! We paid to also see the temporary exhibition which was worth it. If we return to Lisbon we would visit again. Easy to access from Lisbon on the metro (just one change) Also a lovely area to wander round afterwards, we walked along the river and went on the cable car. Fantastic!"

They have a big and pretty impressive main tank full of lots of fish/sharks/etc of differing sizes. It was fun to see the sun fish and the other bigger animals but I do fear they really should be in an unrealistically big aquarium to be comfortable. As it were many of them just swim around and around in the tank which is not a good sign for their longterm mental health.The sea otters also seemed to be kept in a very small pool area, they definitely require more space than that.Big plus for all the smaller aquarias in the lower sections, lots of fun critters to be seen in those."

If you're staying in a bigger city for a couple of days, you tend to end up in an oceanarium at some point and in comparison to others this one seems to keep their animals more or less appropriate to their needs (as far as it's possible to match an animals needs in captivity), so I didnt't feel too guilty while roaming through the different levels of the building. The price is quite high (15 \u20ac for an adult I believe) but reasonable if you keep in mind, what I mentioned about the conditions the animals live in.Now, the big downside to this place is, that it was very crowded. To be fair, it was a rainy afternoon and we expected that quite a lot of people would have the same idea and visit the aquarium, but the reality was overwhelming. Tipp for crowded weekends/rainy days: The oceanarium provides WLAN on the entrance, so you can buy your ticket online via smartphone without waiting half an hour or more in the queue.Once we got inside the building, we couldn't really enjoy any of the attractions because people didn't wait \"in line\" until they could catch a glimpse of an aquarium but rather pushed themselves in front of you and used every inch of space there was. We got annoyed pretty quickly and left half way through.Please, learn to relax. You have every time in the world to stroll through an aquarium. Respect the other visitors who also payed to see this place. There's no first come, first serve or survival of the fittest in a venue like this.In the end, it's a nice place but selfish visitors ruined the experience (at least ours).A big compliment for the beautiful, temporary exhibition!"

Oceanario de Lisboa was smaller than we thought and apart from a few really interesting species like the Sun Fish, in general, it was an acquarium like you can see in many other cities ( i have seen many others that's why i say so). If you are in Lisbon and if you have time you can pay a visit but keep this fact in mind. If you have a limited time and you are with your children, I would rather recommend you to visit the zoo in Lisbon, it is much better in my point of view."

The whole thing is centered around an ENORMOUS tank filled with giant fish and sharks, and around it are separate enclosures for fish of different regions of the world. I was disappointed with the size until I realized there was a whole downstairs that was very very neat. I also was very happy with the living conditions for their animals. I'm certainly no expert but I did work in a zoo for a little while and I found their exhibits to be enriching and healthy.I bought a ticket that included the temporary exhibit and was very disappointed in the temporary exhibit. It was small and unexciting and not worth the extra euros. Unfortunately there are not many plaques describing the animals, but watching them is usually enough for people anyway."

Above average coffee shop.Well done Lisbon on showing how a tourist attraction in a coastal environment can work. Wonderful views of the sweeping bridge and coastline.As an added bonus, there is a major shopping centre within 200 m.

The amount and variety of animals to be seen and the bilingual (english, portuguese) information given makes you stay several hours and sometimes even lose track of time. If you are on holiday in LIsbon, Oceanario is a great idea for a rainy day, as it is completely indoors. Try to visit it in Winter, as in Summer it gets VERY crouded which makes it lose a bit of its atmosphere (this not being an actual criticism as it just proves its popularity)."

It bottle necks there and you can not get anywhere near the glass viewing window. Do not worry there will be many other viewing windows that are not crowded. The meditation/Rain Forest exhibit was serene and thought provoking as well as sobering. Do not miss it.... We stopped for a soda at the Cafe and found it crowded and messy.. do not bother.

Wait till you get to the permanent exhibition in another building where all 5 ocean habitats are displayed in a united environment. Plus all the individual display tanks that accompany the different genus; from dragon fish to tiny eels that poke their heads from the sand. Can't think of anything similar, done so well, anywhere else in the world. You won't find captive creatures here on display for the entertainment of the masses.

I have made a good friend with a ray he and I had a long conversation through the glass.

It was beautiful this is beauty at its best I sat there for some time just drinking it all in. Takashi Aramo was a genius and deserves a permanent place there."

The central exhibit is of course the main tank with its varied inhabitants. As we walked around we had many opportunities to view the inhabitants of the tank from different angles. At some points the glass is curved, at others flat. Visibility is amazing. There are smaller tanks with specialised environments for their inhabitants. In the open air one can view penguins and see from the surface fish from different locations/oceans. Then it is possible to see the same creatures from under the water eg penguins swimming underwater, fish indigenous to the Indian Ocean area observed above ground in their pool, then see them swimming deeper in an area of the large tank. It's hard to imagine the set-up until experienced. There is also a temporary exhibit - forests underwater. Interesting but not exciting! Facilities - souvenir shop at exit, kiosk on entrance approach, cafe, educational facilities and plenty of WCs at breakout points throughout the exhibition - very important when visiting with children! All in all - very worthwhile visit and value for money."

And you can get lost (not literally) wondering around this magical underwater world, created to make you feel like you are walking with the fish! The enormous central core of the aquarium is simply mesmerising! There are so many different types of fish in there its impossible to count! Amongst the majestic manta rays, tantalising tuna and the stunning sharks you will come across the most unexpected (and enormous) fish you have ever seen!! The Sun fish!! Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!! The rest of the aquarium is also very wonderfully laid out, you simply follow the path in a spiral and you get all the way round, from corner to corner exploring the differing environments and animals, as if you had traveled to far reaching corners of the world! The ice caps and penguins, the rainforests, the fresh waters and otters, each time feeling like you have walked into another world and always returning though to the stunning central core of the sea world... a real fabulous experience, which I would highly recommend!!"

The worlds regions are represented in the aquarium, I and the children found the penguins quite a treat in the artic section. The sea otters in the North American were equally interesting and playful.It doesn't take long to visit the aquarium, of course, depending on the level of interest in learning about the many species kept, for us it was a good way of getting out of the rain for a few hours. Nevertheless a worthwhile visit."

Smile didn't get from our faces from moment we entering it to moment we exit it, and long after. There is big round tank wit many species and walking path is around that tank. And there are many smaller tanks around walking path. No, you can't see wales, great white shark, but, never mind. Among many creatures, for example guitarfish, devil giant ray, there is one slow, ugly, but fascinating monster, sun fish. We could watch it for hours. And, don't look only at big and beautiful. There are many small creatures which are either colourful, strange looking or interesting by behavior that you can spent lots of time examine. It is a little expensive, but for us was well worth spent money. And there is whole experience. What I mean: You come to Oriente station, It is by itself interesting architecture. Across the street there is Vasco de Gama mall. Then you continue to Parque de Nacoes, park made for Woorld Expo 1998. You can walk park, enjoy funicular parallel to river Tejo, and as cherry on cake go to Ocaenario. So, if Oceanario itself is not convincing, wrap it with mentioned places making half day trip to that part of Lisbon, and you will be happy for doing that."

The climatic zone displays are the best I have ever seen, and the lack of glass screens made you really feel part of the displays. The Penguins were close enough to touch, birds flying over your head, otters relaxing only a metre or two away. Huge variety of fish in all the displays including the huge sunfish. The temporary display in the entrance building is also spectacular and proves that gardens can be landscaped in the water as well as on land. The building itself is an example of great modern architecture and the tiled exterior walls are really well done.Can be reached by the metro and the surrounding area is quite a modern contrast compared to the old part of Lisbon so allow time to have a walk around."

The actual tank itself is roomy and tranquil and the variety of sharks, rays and fish was awesome. The otters in the arctic section are really cute and obviously very happy. The tank was being cleaned and the otters were having great fun with the divers tube and equipment. There is the allusion that the otters and penquins dive into the same tank as the sharks but its not as the water temp is very different. a great and enjoyable day. the food in the restaurant didnt look very appertising and and was expensive so eat before or after. The food court in the shopping complex by the train station has lots to offer"

Loved all the surrounding displays including the penguins, puffins, terns and most of all the cute sea otters which were floating in the water, heads touching preening themselves with almost human mannerisms. Lots of other displays of incredible sea creatures and topped off with an wonderful temporary exhibition, \"submerged forests\" by Takashi Amano. Huge tanks with the most beautiful tiny fresh water fish and incredibly realised natural landscaping with subtle planting and placement of twigs etc. The effect was enhanced by relaxing music and the whole effect was magical and memorable.

It's a 15 minute walk from the metro stop and through the shoping centre.Booked online and glad we did, there was probably over 100 in the ticket office queue - we were guided straight through to the main entrance after showing my PDF ticket emailed to me on my phone. They also say it's 10% cheaper online as well. The main tank is just superb, and the highlights for us were the sharks, the sunfish ( rare to see in an aquarium ) and the stingrays and mantas. As you walk around in a path around the main tank, you go through different habitats of sea life. There are penguins plus a tropical area. There are many more tanks of fish and sealife to see as you explore, with the main tank viewing areas coming back to delight. We went to the temporary exhibition which was also worthwhile. The main cafe is ok, there's a 4 course set menu with a choice of mains and a drink for about \u20ac10. Shop is very expensive as they often are in these types of places. Good value for \u20ac50 (\u00a336) - costs \u00a367 in Blue Planet for a family of 5. "

On the day we went (a bright day in mid October) it was busyish but you could still take your time and wander with plenty of room to get good views and pictures of the creatures. The imperious Sunfish and the sea otter were amongst the most interesting. The layout probably afforded the best 360 degree view of penguins compared with other wildlife collections I have visited with excellent views of them beneath the water as well as on the surface and on land. The modern building design is itself quite interesting. There is an interactive area where kids can explore the interelationship between human and marine environments. The tanks and displays are augmented by some written information but there could have been mire of this, We did not visit the temporary exhibition so can't comment on this,"

The temporary exhibitions is ok, but the main tank and the surrounding fauna are awesome.You can book in advance online, and you can use the ticket 120 days from the date of purchase, it's 10% of the pricey 14 euro +3 euro temporary exhibition.You get a 15% discount if you buy the Lisbon Card.If you have at least 4-5 hours time until you catch your next flight(reserve at least 2 hours for visiting) is very close to the airport- 3 stations to be exact at Oriente Station.You ca also have a decent meal for 8 euro with everything included from soup to main course, dessert, and beverage!"

I would suggest that you buy tickets in advance on line. The ticket line was quite long. It happened to be a Sunday, so it was somewhat crowded with families.We had a wonderful time. the exhibits are interesting and the presentation was excellent.It was nice to see Lisbon families out for a day of fun. It seems like we spent too much time rubbing shoulders with other tourists. So it was nice to talk to locals. There was a special exhibit called \"forests underwater\" that was very beautiful."

It was a nice aquarium with a few interesting species such as sunfish, manta ray and penguins which was lovely to see, however I can't help but feel it's a bit overrated, it is all laid out around one main tank - which is an incredible huge tank holding sharks, manta ray and sunfish amongst other fish species - this tank I would rate 5*, it is excellent, however it gets tiresome seeing the same tank over and over again with only a few small tanks containing other species around the edge (with the exception of a penguin enclosure and a otter enclosure although we only saw 1 otter). My favourite part of aquarium is a shark tunnel, however there was no shark tunnel here, the only sharks were in the main central tank and there wasn't much of a species variety. Overall it was good, but not amazing. Also don't bother paying extra for the temporary exhibition, it was very disappointing. A nice day out all in all but I probably wouldn't return unless they added more to it."

The big central tank was really impressive with lots of spectaular exhibits - sun fish, manta rays, several types of shark - amongst many others.We did have to queue to buy our tickets but the queue moved quickly and, because my partner is on crutches at the moment, we were spotted and taken to lifts to reach the different levels without having to ask.

It gets very very crowded, we visited mid week first thing in the morning and it was packed. The aquarium is built around a central tank and there are lots of viewing windows so move on when one gets crowded and you should get a good view.

Two enormous sunfish (2 ton) are in the main tank too. All information is is Portuguese and English. Very fair admission price. Nearby is gondola ride along the river."

Very informative and a well organised establishment. The outside is covered in ceramic fish scales ane the waterfall outside is amazing. Lovely place for children who tend to be too fascinated to misbehave, plenty of interactive stuff too. Outside there is a lake surrounding the Oceanarium which has fish and jellyfish clearly visible. Nearby is the cablecar to ride on. We could easily have spent longer there but can recommend the whole expo 98 area as interesting, clean and worth a visit."

Be aware that there were no signs in the huge Paco des Nacoes pointing out this place in April 2015. Nothing's even written on the building itself.

The marine displays where also top notch, though I think the Barcelona aquarium beats it by a notch, highlights where the Amano tank, Sea Otters ( hard to find - but worth waiting and looking for ) and the giant Sun fish.

Access is across a short bridge, although there is also a really nice temporary exhibit on the entrance side of the bridge that's well worth a look. The Oceanarium itself is a cool design, with a massive in the middle which you walk around, both at below tank level and surface level. A couple of cool features really stand out and push it above the level of previous ones I've been to, firstly there are concave walls to the tank, you can stand at the apex of the wall and feel like you're totally immersed in the tank, which is great. The second bit is that the various animals appear to be contained in the same tank even when they're segregated. They do this by having rock and glass walls between the various tank elements, so it looks like the otters are swimming with the sharks, but thankfully they're separated. It's definitely worth a visit, either with kids or without!"

Each zone is linked to each other through a big aquarium which include numerous massive fish including sun fish - which we have never seen before. They have the cutest sea otters and penguins as well. I really enjoyed my visit.I really would recommend you travelling out to east Lisbon to see this brilliant aquarium."

The creatures on exhibit range from Pacific sea otters to Mola Mola, the Sunfish, and from grass eels to spider crab. On the second floor of the entrance building, there is a temporary exhibition by a Japanese aquarist, which presents small freshwater species like cyclids and tetras in their own environment, complete with the plant species they thrive among. The Oceanarium is an informative reminder of how much we depend on the seas that cover 70% of our planet and how little we still understand about them. Beautifully presented and well curated."

The central tank, containing a huge variety of fish including huge Sun Fish, is stunning and it was fun to see two frogmen inside for a time. Information on nearly all the species was readily found in Portuguese and English; however we would have liked some further information to be available to take away, which it didn't seem to be even in the shop at the end unless it was in a hardback book which we didn't want. In particular we wanted to know precisely how they prevent the sharks and barracudas in the big central tank from eating the smaller fish, and which fish are still sustainably fished and therefore recommended to eat (in a country where every restaurant seems to serve at least as wide a range of fish as they do meat)! From reading the labels we got the impression that virtually everything is endangered in the wild and shouldn't be eaten, including cod which we saw on every restaurant menu in Lisbon and the Algarve. I was also concerned about lots of visitors using flash to take photos, in contravention of the signs, but the staff took no action on this; I wondered whether the fish are happy and if not, how the staff would know. We enjoyed it very much but not quite as much as the aquarium in the French port of La Rochelle which was stupendous."

Okay, So this place was highly rated so my life and i were very excited to go since we love Monterrey Bay Aquarium and we kind of like long beach aquarium.This place basically had one main tank, which is cool, and a bunch of small exhibits around it. It is a creative set up and had i never been to Monterrey, this place would get another star. They have a good assortment of fish on the main tank like a few different sharks, molas, rays, and fishes. One thing i want to point out is they have a sea otter that has no kelp, no diving space and hides in the corner of their medium size exhibit. This has got to be cruel especially since there are sharks in the same exhibit. Where can this otter clean it's fur and feel safe? I'm boarderline on making this a one star but i can't rate off one exhibit.If you have gone to an aquarium like Monterrey, this place sucks."

Just not sure it's one of #1 or #2 things to do in Lisbon (as it is currently ranked at time of writing).I suppose maybe I had built up expectations, given the high TripAdvisor rating and the rave commentary, quoted as \"mind blowing\" on various ads, including a massive floor mural upon arrival at Lisbon airport.As aquariums go, I would say the Kaiyukan in Osaka (whale-sharks!), or the Monterey Bay aquarium in California (hammerheads!) both have more impressive central tanks. But this one is still up there, and they do have a good variety of sea life, including Manta, sea dragons and Mambo fish.The highlight to me were the Magellanic Penguins, as the design of the exhibit allows to get up pretty close without any high barrier in between. The otters are adorable as well.In general our family always enjoys aquariums, and the layout and design here was access friendly and interesting. Basically a single corridor path circles around the central tank and guides you through the permanent visit, so you don't feel like maybe there are other wings or areas you may have missed or need to go back and forth to see everything. (It also makes it easy to keep track of the little ones running around).We paid the extra fee to see the temporary exhibit as well (submerged forests by Amano Takashi), which was very cool, but given that it's just one single room, felt a little bit overpriced.Overall we enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say it was mind-blowing. My mind was not blown.It was a bit out of the way to get to by metro from where we were staying in Baixa, but not too bad. We rounded it out with a ride on the Teleferico nearby, which gives a good view of the Vasco Da Gama bridge and world expo park."

It had one large tank in the middle that you walk around, and you end up seeing this tank about 10 times. It is very impressive, but it does get a little boring after a while, and I found myself losing interest in the center tank, which is arguably the main attraction and just looking at the smaller exhibits around the outside.

Luckily, we managed to get enough of an internet signal to buy our tickets online. And then it was, skip the queue and straight in. So satisfying. heh.Since I'm from New Zealand, the only fish I was really interested in seeing was the sun fish. It was huge and incredibly ugly. My husband described it as cancer with a tumor. I'm not sure it's that ugly, but anyway. Apparently, if you put a sun fish in an aquarium with corners, it can get stuck and then die. When you see it, you'll understand.There are 3 viewing levels of the \"fish bowl\". A lot of people were queueing up at the first 2 windows, when they could've just moved around to the next window. Probably the bottom level has the most space for viewing. A lot of people were sitting on the ground in front of the windows.As you move around the tank, it leads you into other smaller habitats which have otters, jellyfish, starfish, anemones, etc...NB. It is relatively dark, quite warm and airless inside. I don't suffer from claustrophobia but I was starting to feel very closed in and had to go and spend some time in the outdoors bit.I didn't feel like the short term exhibit added anything to the experience. However, my friends felt like they had a near religious experience there. So, eh.On the ground floor they had a very nice cafe.

Look out for the sun fish. There are so many different types of fish, some smaller fish and some really large monsters.There are several other smaller tanks that house the smaller fish which let you see them much better as they would be far too small for the central tank.This place is not just about fish, as there are also penguins, puffins, frogs and otters that you have to see.If you are interested there are some learning zones for the kids to learn about the fish and you also can learn about the efforts that are put into running this facility."

No need to join the crowd at the fist window when entering there will be at least a dozen more windows on the same view. Other aquaria around the sides a little more hit and miss. Everybody loves the cute otters. The tropical reef aquarium beautifully put together.Worth sitting down in the auditorium and seeing the film of behind the scenes.

The aquarium can also be used by other persons to practise meditation and yoga as it's such a pacific place to be in. Be aware of the time you have to visit this place as its extension is so big and involving that hours may be feel like minutes. It has taken us about 5 hours to go all around it when we thought it only has taken us just over 2 hours to do it. Take plenty of batteries as spares for all your fotos :-)"

The designer Peter Chermayeff is famous for building large Aquariums. I would strongly recommend for anyone visiting to come early because there are masses of people waiting to get in. If you have a baby with a strolller you have priority and can skip the line. We were fetched by a worker from the Aquarium as we were waiting and instead of waiting for about 90 minutes, were inside in 10! There is an extense variety of wildlife in the Ozeanario, including fish, birds and mammals that will interest public of all ages. There are elevators available for strollers and wheelchairs. I would also suggest that you bring the smallest stroller you have to Lisbon because it is easier to manoever wherever you go. A day trip in the area would be best, you can take the cable car (not included as part of the Oceanario) and have lunch in one of the many Restaurants in the area. There are also many other attractions for the children, such as a knowledge Center and many fountains. The visit is definitively worthwhile."

The Oceanario de Lisboa features two exhibitions, the permanent exhibition and a temporary one.The permanent exhibition is a true feast for your senses, you start on the top floor where you can \"travel\" trough 4 different habitats and spend literally hours looking to the main tank and it's hundreds of sea creatures. On the lower floor there are dozens of smaller tanks, each one with different creatures, mimicking their habitats in nature. The Oceanario is a true beautiful place, from its architecture to the effort made to make you feel that you are somewhere below the water, in the antarctic or in a rain forest. This exhibition per si is more than a reason to visit this amazing place.The second exhibition, the temporary one, is now devoted to the \"Florestas Submersas\" (underwater forests) an amazing 40 meter tank, made by Takashi Amano and the Oceanario crew. It is a breathtaking scenario, with literally thousand of small fishes, and a luxuriant flora. This is the world largest tank of it's kind and deserves a visit.Oceanario de Lisboa is definitely the best place to visit in Lisbon."

It is very cleverly designed around the ocean regions of the world with excellent information and viewing points. We had not pre booked so the queue was about 15minutes but it was in the shade. It is not something I would normally visit without children but it was very very enjoyable and relaxing. Definitely worth a visit if you have the time. Nearby there is a cable car which travels along the whole park with fabulous views of the Vasco de Gama bridge"

That will save you a lot of time. There is one huge aquarium in the middle of the Oceanario, you can observe the life inside from different perspectives. It goas across 2 floors and there is great number of viewpoints where you can just sit and watch for hours these amazing creatures including sharks. It is almost hypnotizing. Apart from that there is big number of small aquariums, but these are not that good. Make sure you see the otters, these are really cute."

Very educational if you want it to be so or just enjoyable if, like us, we wandered through without stopping to read everything. We didn't stop to eat there but the restaurant looks nice - very clean and organised. As with all tourist attractions you need to walk through the shop to get out but I am happy to say that it it was well stocked with quality buys and very little tack!

Though there was long queue, but it was moving fast and were were in after ~20min wait. The permanent exhibit is 14 Euros and if you also like to see the permanent + temporary exhibit then it is 17 Euros total. The temporary exhibit was some model of warm fresh water fishes by a Japanese creator. This temporary exhibit was okish-stuff, I would not recommend visiting it (just 1 floor of aquarium with tiny fishes and underwater plants). The permanent exhibit is excellent, as many others have reviewed. Varieties of ocean life can be seen here. Other than that there are exhibits of deep sea creatures, penguins, otter, frogs, corals, etc. It is a must visit and keep at least 2 hours at hand. Only complain is I couldn't take good photographs due to the crowd and the prohibition on using flash (even if you use flash, the thick glass barriers reflects back a lot of life)."

They have a really big tank that you see from mostly every step of the way which was quite amazing at first, but then realized that it was one of the only attraction in the entire aquarium. If you want to go to an actual aquarium, i would 100% prefer the one in England. The sea life aquarium have a walk in tunnel which makes you feel like you are under the water. It's amazing. From all the good reviews on trip advisor about this aquarium, I expected much more. The only thing that i actually took interest in on the trip was the view on the way there. The view was immaculate. On the way back there is a place for cable cars which I highly recommend. It makes the boring trip ten times better. If you enjoyed the trip to this aquarium, I advise you that you head to a more well known aquarium to see what you are missing out on. I would recommend you going if you were below the age of 5"

However, the whole place is really crowded, it's very hard to move around and see things. Also there is one big central tank which you see many, many times. The topical area was very nicely done. The queue for the toilets was about 20 minutes. The kids got fed up with the crowds and became disinterested. The large tank is impressive but I have been to better aquariums that are less crowded and more interactive. Difficult to find taxis when leaving and they won't pick up families of more than 4 people, it's a long way out from the city so you need transport to get back as it's not really walkable. We got round in about an hour. Would rather have spent more time in the city centre."

The smaller tanks with all kinds of fish and saline from around the world was also very interesting. We spent a few hours and both kids and parents had a wonderful time. The line for the ticket window was long but you can order tickets online and skip the line. The even have wi fi service outside so you can order tickets on your smartphone outside the venue. The Oceanario is outside the centre of town but the Metro will take you there in 10-15 minutes."

I went on a weekend (probably why so crowded) and it was a bit more expensive than most exhibits in Lisbon- I think around 18 euros without the special exhibit. The line moved quickly and the interior was really well done. There is a central tank with sharks, rays and tons of different varieties of sea life. You can see this tank in many different viewings throughout the aquarium so don't waste time in the beginning where the crowds gather. I loved the otters- they were feeding them and they were very funny. They were definitely the crowd pleasers. Overall a nice way to get out of the heat but it is out of the way. It would definitely be worth it for those groups traveling with children. The surrounding area is also really cool to walk around."

The penguen area is also very realistic and the otters are quite funny to watch. Animals are well treated and the aquarium very well maintained.

As a family traveling with a mixed age range (parents, children and grandparents) finding something for everyone is sometimes a challenge - but the oceanario did it!We all loved it here - there was initially a rather large crowd but we went slowly and they seemed to all disappear so we had lots of time and space to stand in front of the enormous viewing panes and just watch the world swim by! We actually ended up there for ages as we went by slowly just loving what we saw.Out of the five weeks of Europe this was one of my daughters top 5 - which is saying something! Defo recommend if you have kids!Also when we were there, there was a special exhibit of \"trees under the sea\" or something - it was utterly enchanting and almost meditative with its pretty views and calming music! My only suggestion for the areas is that there is remarkably little to eat nearby or in the oceanario but if you walk over to the far side of the lagoon (where the cable car goes) there were lots of eating options."

This is a very popular attraction so it is wise to book tickets online, where they are cheaper, paperless and allow you to walk straight into the oceanarium without any queuing! I went to the Oceanario de Lisboa on my own and it made for a good hour's entertainment. The premise of the oceanarium's layout is that all of the oceans are connected and the displays are set out as such that all of the 'zones' radiate from the same central point, which is a thought provoking idea. The large tanks are interesting, with plenty of places to stop and look at the fish and the opportunity to sit down. It is very popular with children and families and so can get pretty busy, but that's to be expected. I wouldn't say that it's somewhere I would feel the need to visit more than once but it was an enjoyable experience."

But the park outside is really nice and we took the funicular as well. The area around the Oceanario has a ghost town feel, and while there are a few restaurants, there's not a lot going on.

They have a temporary and permanent exhibit. The temporary one had a Japanese artists work on display and it was very peaceful and beautiful. The permanent one has a large tank that seems to be shared with all the other small tanks off to the side so all the animals can freely swim between habitat zones. I could be wrong, but I think that's how it was laid out, from what I could tell. The central tank has all the big fish(sharks, mantas and some other massive breeds of fish) the side tanks are divided in to habitats ranging from tropical to cold. Our daughters loved watching the sea otters. They give them ice cubes to nibble on and these little guys are hilarious to watch. There is also a science museum right next door so be sure to check that out too. Our little one had a blast there, I think even more fun there than at this aquarium, but just because there were so many hands on things for her to do."

There were two exhibitions offered, the permanent and the temporary ones, and we purchased tickets for both of them. Upon entering, we got to see the magnificent central aquarium, which we can certainly say has not found its match. It contains many species of fishes and invertebrates, as if the oceans were brought together in one place. Everything is nicely organised and well marked, with many fun and educational spots for the kids. Apart from the vast variety of fish, we got to see penguins, otters, corals, and frogs - all set in skillfully assembled habitats. The temporary exhibition was called \"Forests Underwater\", the largest nature aquarium in the world, designed by Japanese aquarist Takashi Amano. The restaurant is also worthwhile, offering reasonably priced meals, drinks, and desserts. At the end of the tour, make sure you have enough money for the gift shop, because it is almost impossible to leave without buying a souvenir."

It's great that you can see the marine life of different parts of the world (the aquarium is divided into distinct sections; you might need a jacket in the Antarctic section). In the middle you can look at all the different fish in a huge aquarium and just sit on a bench and watch them swimming by. Besides that there are lots of smaller marine animals to see and study.

It is like a deep-sea diving experience without any of the risks, with about 25,000 fish, seabirds, and mammals in an enormous central tank that is the size of four Olympic-sized swimming pools. Visitors can look into it from different levels for close-ups of the various creatures, including different species of sharks. But it's the design rather than the size that makes it outstanding. It is the first aquarium ever to incorporate world ocean habitats within a single environment, with impressive recreations of various ocean ecosystems -- the Antarctic tank containing penguins, and the Pacific tank with otters playing in rock pools.

We have seen a few aquariums in our time, but this was probably the best. Our favourite part was the giant aquarium that could be viewed from two floors and several angles. The giant Sunfish were a species I had never seen before. We stood there for hours, just watching the fish. They also have a very interesting film that provides some behind the scenes information about the operations of the aquarium. A good way to spend a day!"

Sharks, rays, otters and more. Prepare to spend at least 3-4 hours, more if you're going to learn about everything. As a bonus, the Oceanario is located right at the waterfront at the former Expo site, so there's plenty of restaurants well worth your while.\u00e4 - and a very large shopping mall nearby, at the oriente railway station.Ps.

I have been an aquarium enthusiast for many years and even have had a salt water reef tank in my home but the Oceanario blows away everything I have seen before away. We started with the temporary exhibition which was designed and implemented by a photographic artist. It was magic! The entire large room was surrounded on 3 sides by large aquaria filled with water plants and designed to look like several gardens full of greenery of different shapes and shades of colour with the water movement moving the branches as if they were in a breeze and the colourful fish seemed to replace butterflies and other insects. We were entranced! The music in the room for perfectly. The permanent exhibition is massive and is made up of multiple aquaria (all extremely large-huge) surrounding a central, utterly massive main tank. Each of the separate areas represent one of the earths seas with aquatic life appropriate to that sea in it. The main tank is unbelievably large( I need to look up what volume but haven't yet) and contains thousands of fish, sharks, corals, sponges and other marine life. It includes 2 big (and I mean big) sunfish, many varieties of shark, at least 1 manta ray, lots of other rays of different species groupers, cod and etcetera. If I lived in Lisbon I would be visiting frequently. This is a visit worthwhile for any age including toddlers as much of the display is floor to ceiling glass."

Temporary exhibit of rainforest well worth it. Spent 2 hours.

Anyway, they have exhibits of species from all the oceans. They also have some puffin birds and penguins. The river around the building - kind of like a moat effect, unfortunately has garbage floating in it. I don't know why they don't keep that clean. That being said, I did see every huge jelly fish in the river when I was walking up the walkway to the entrance. I think it is worth the time to visit."

It's a pretty impressive collection in a very logical layout (making walking through the exhibit easy), but there are very few signs, and the few signs that are there have very little information (and no QR codes for more info). Right from the start you're given a beautiful view of the main tank, but without a single sign telling you anything about what you're seeing. Later in the tour you'll pass by 8 main views of this same tank, and a few of them do have signs identifying a few of the fish in the tank, but this is pretty representative of the whole place: alarmingly uninformative. Unless you happen to know the name of the animal and can google it on your phone, you're not going to learn anything here. It almost seems as if their main goal is to teach people that animals in cages are pretty. I prefer zoos and aquaria that focus more on conservation and education."

There is a nice and modern shopping mall nearby and great restaurants facing the beachfront besides a nice botanical garden and suspended transportation with nice views. The Oceanario is similar to others around the world where the visitors walk under and around a huge water tank full of sharks and other exotic sea creatures. Great for kids.

Inside, the route is centred around a main aquarium with some pretty huge fish inside. You follow the route around areas replicating various temperate regions from around the world.The information given in Portuguese and English is just enough to keep you informed.A short film show at the end is very interesting. It tells you how much work goes on behind the scenes of this excellent facility.Well worth a trip"

I especially loved the Oceanografic in Valencia earlier this year where I spent the whole day, and when hearing this was one of the other larger aquariums in Europe, I had high expectations.There is no entry ticket for students, instead I had to pay the full 17\u20ac, which I thought wouldn't be so bad, including the temporary exhibition. However, I feel that the price is overpriced, I managed to walk around everywhere in 35 minutes and left feeling deflated. As there is only one pathway through the aquarium, you can't choose where to go first and it was a shame as certain areas were overcrowded and it made the experience less enjoyable and made me want to move on, but with little chance of going back.I'm surprised TripAdvisor has this rated as the top activity in Lisbon, as there are so many other amazing things to see and do in this city."

I decided to visit this place with my fiancee partly because I like seas and fish etc, and partly beause it was very hot that day in Lisbon and I hoped to be cool down there. It turned out to be the right decision.Oceanario de Lisboa is supposedly one of the largest and most beautiful in all Europe. I haven't seen the others but this one was quite impressive indeed. The main (central) tank alone was huge containing all sorts of sea life. You could admire it from all possible angles and from 2 levels and it really had some impressive specimens to show. Plus the smaller corners with all sorts of curiosities. And of course the supposedly only 2 living sea otters in Europe who had obviously a perfectly good time - quite cute to look at, actually.Children would obviously love this place but I would certainly recommend it to adults as well. The more so that the Park of Nations is just close by and has also lots to offer.A good place to spend some time."

The oceanarium is wonderfully designed and will keep you engaged thoroughly. It's a great place to take kids.

It's well lit and maintained and home to many species of fish including Sun Fish, sharks and rays. Elsewhere are smaller tanks with other fish and animals, all well presented. At the time of our visit there was a temporary exhibit of underwater gardens by Takashi Amano, a Japanese artist.

Temporary exhibition really beautiful too. If there were to be negatives, i think some of the massive tank rocks look a bit manufactured rather than natural.

We were so surprised how big the aquarium was and all the stuff to do nearby. The aquarium has a huge tank that you circle throughout your walk. The whole experience is at least one hour. It's clean, has great fish, and the signs are in multiple languages. The otters are adorable. They very clearly take care of everything here. Afterwards, we took the cable cars for a ride (right behind the aquarium) and ate a huge sushi buffet (next door). The science museum is right there too--loved all of it!!

It's great for kids too, as there are also pengiuns, otters and all other kinds of animals apart from fish. The most impressive is the huge tank in the middle.

We have been to the Vancouver and Phoenix aquariums and this was amazing. The whole exist seems to spiral around a central aquarium teeming with sharks, rays, fish and of course, sun fish. It's an easy walk and our 3 year old was enthralled. The building itself is also beautiful. I wanted to write a review while still in the cafeteria here. The prices are very reasonable. The meal of the day is the option of lasagna, rabbit, or fish (oddly enough). It was truly a terrible meal. Probably one of the very worst meals I have ever had travelling. If I find something else soon I would have no problem making myself vomit so I could forget this meal all together. If you have to come, come early as all the food isn't kept at even close to a proper temperature and by early afternoon the bacteria which doubles every 20 min at this temp will have taken over. The vegetable soup tastes like expired medicine ground up with industrial road chalk. We all 4 of us ate a bit till we lost our appetites. Great place to watch the swim five stars for sure. Just don't eat the food....it may just ruin Europe for you."

The first floor, where the tour starts, is partitioned into four corners around the main aquarium, each displaying a different oceanic zone (Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Polar). A part of the aquarium extends into these corners that also houses birds and plants in the openings. The tour then takes one to the ground floor where individual exhibits of specific sea life specimens can be seen. The Oceanarium makes the artificiality apparent. The sounds of the ocean that are always played through the tour though, were quite interesting.As said, this place could serve a good attraction to those visiting such a thing for the first time. But for those who have already seen such sea-life exhibits, it is no special thing."

I do love a good aquarium but I expected more from this Oceanarium.Here are the pros as I walked away with mixed feelings on this place.- It's easy enough to get to, catch the red line Metro and get off at Oriente and its a 10 min walk from the station. You can walk across the strange bridge made of wooden pallets which is disorientating but fun!-It had plenty of written information about conservation of the ocean which is always a great thing in my book-Some great eco systems have been replicated and information supplied on these all.-It's compact and easy to navigate-Some nice species of fish, including the rarely seen Sunfish - you'll get some nice pictures of the rays and sharks by way of the enormous tank they all live in. The puffins / penguins / sea otters were also a treat for the eyesAnd now, sadly, the cons:-Expensive to get in - 14 euros per adult for the permanent exhibitions only. -Queues were crazy, I felt there should have been more staff on at peak times to cope with the volume of people visiting-It feels smaller than you think it is, don't worry if you can't initially see into the main tank because of the children and people in the way as you circle it the whole way round several times anyway. I put this as a con as the tank doesn't look big enough.-Other people - you're warned not to use flash photography but I saw countless people that blatantly ignored this, which irritated me - there was a lack of staff on duty to police this or be available for supplying information.- I saw there were videos to watch but never got to see them, too crowded and no system in place to ensure that everyone could enjoy the full information on offer.It felt hot in there constantly and very crowded, not so much the fault of the Oceanarium but I expected to see more in the way of diverse species, more information on the sea birds, seals and deep sea creatures and mammals. As it was smaller than expected, we were only in and walking around for just over an hour. A mixed bag for this big kid I'm afraid.."

The video at the end was worth waiting for - it's from the 90s so a bit dated in place but it shows how they feed the various animals in the huge central tank, really fascinating.

We got our tickets way up ahead nice and cheap while we were in London from their website. We did not have to select a date. We just had to use them within a month. We got 10% discount off and it was very straightforward. We printed the tickets at home and brought them with us. We jumped past a huge queue that were waiting to buy the full price tickets and got ushered straight through. Sweet!!! The place was absolutely charming. I recommend trying to be at the front when the Otters are being fed. They are so fun to watch. We loved the way the place is laid out and the variety of really well kept animals you can see. It takes a while to get around though. It took us about 3 hours. It was Worth the money."

It was well worth the wait! The permanent exhibit area is very well organized, with arrows pointing in the direction of each next section. The Aquarium did not disappoint, and has multiple opportunities to view the fish inside, so there is no need to spend too long at the very first viewpoint. There were several types of ocean life inside the main aquarium tank that I have never seen before, including sunfish and guitar fish. The signs explaining the various types of fish are in both Portuguese and English and are well spaced out throughout the building. The side exhibits are arranged by habitat/area of the world, tropical, sections of the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian oceans, etc, and a section on amphibians. The otters and penguins were especially cute! There is also an emphasis on conservation throughout the exhibits, which I greatly appreciated. It was worth the wait in line and the price of admission, which is 14 Euro for an adult for the permanent exhibit, plus an extra 3 for the Temporary exhibit. There were many many young children there, and they seemed to really enjoy themselves and were absorbed by what they were learning. It took my husband and I about 2 and a half hours to see everything."

Nonetheless, I came away with what appear to be some great shots.Before leaving, we relaxed in the cafeteria with a nice bowl of soup.

There are a few habitats for penguins and sea otters at 2nd level, while at level 1 there are small aquariums with fish, octopus etc. What i found very nice and soothing is that as you go round the huge tank, there are sitting areas (a lot of them). When i visited i wasn't feeling well, so siting there in the dark and watching the tank was a very soothing experience for me. Price of 14 euros seems a bit much. However, if you catch the feeding times for the penguins or sea otters, it's a nice show."

The Oceanarium is conveniently located near the Oriente metro station (on the red line to the airport.) Coming off the metro, follow the signs for the \"Vasco da Gama\" shopping mall (large mall with dozens and dozens of stores, cafes and a movie theatre!) Walk through the shopping mall, cross the street and head straight towards the ocean, and then turn right. Admission is 14 euros, but a family discount is available for 36 euros (two adults and two children.) The main aquarium tank is absolutely huge and contains a variety of species of devil-fish, sunfish, stingrays, sharks, etc. There were so many different fish, and angles to view the tank that you could literally spend hours just there. Our kids particularly enjoyed the penguin exhibit, which was very popular. The Oceanairum also contains a gift shop (10% discount with your receipt) and a popular cafe. For those needing it, there is a lift/elevator inside. TIP: After your visit, consider taking a ride on the cable car, which is just literally 50 meters outside the front door. A round-trip ticket gives a beautiful view of the coastline and sea, and you will usually have a \"car\" all to yourself. Enjoy!"

The oceanario was recommended to me by a couple of friends as being a top highlight in Lisbon, and I was not disappointed.By going in the afternoon, we were able to see the otters being fed, and enjoyed the bright sunlight coming through the upper windows into some of the exhibits. I definitely suggest bringing water and/or snacks, especially if you have kids. Unlike most places in Portugal, there was no opportunity for a coffee break. We probably rushed through the last 3 rooms and were surprised that the exhibit went on for so long.That said, the exhibits were very, very impressive. Very organized, very well-presented, with good information. I would definitely go back to this again. Note: this place might not be great for someone who doesn't like dark spaces or who has vertigo. The entire exhibit is built around the aquarium, which is several stories high. On the bottom floor, where there is little natural light, the glass can be a bit disorienting. Still, if that's not a concer for you, I highly recommend adding this to you itinerary."

All very informative, with pictures so you are able to identify which fish/sharks/rays are what. Smaller tanks hold seahorses, jellyfish and various other sea creatures.You don't have to worry about not seeing anything due to so many seating/viewing areas which give you a 360 view of all the tank.

The place is popular with people of all ages, tourists and Portuguese alike. There are no dolphins but rays and sharks, groupers, sun fish, yellow fin tuna, and many other species.

I still can't work out why the sharks didn't eat the sea-otters...My one grumble is a minor one, but should be so obvious to the management: the shop has almost no guidebooks in English (or French, or Spanish), yet on the day we were there probably 95% of the visitors were from outside Portugal.

The signage and text is clear and readable and well-written without being long and tedious. They also have some cool programs like 'Sleep with the Sharks' for kids which are worth checking our for travellers with young ones.

Biggest aquarium is in the center and really blows your mind. Going with children should be great, but going alone is also good to watch fish and clear mind. If you are visiting Lisbon going here is a must."

We made a trip to Lisbon's oceanarium on the final day of our visit to the city, as it's located on the way to the airport from the city centre. We made sure to book our tickets online the night before, which provided a 15% saving.What an incredible experience this turned out to be! I have always been a fan of aquariums and oceanariums, and the diversity of life on display here is very impressive in comparison to others I have seen. They have specimens of two of my favourite animals - the cuttlefish and the critically endangered axolotl - neither of which I had ever seen before 'in person!'While there are many small tanks and displays with rare amphibians, jellyfish, corals, anemones, sponges, crustaceans and so on, the obvious highlight of the experience is the central tank, with a seemingly endless collection of weird and wonderful fish, rays and sharks all in one place! The oceanarium is laid out such that you are always moving around with some kind of visible access to this central tank, and some of the windows in their scale are truly awe-inspiring.There was no temporary exhibition on while we went, but I would recommend you give at least 2 hours to stroll through the main exhibition at your leisure."

Lisbon's Oceanarium is the largest indoor aquarium in Europe and 6th in the world, with 5000 meter cubic of water. With over 450 species of fish, marine mammals and birds, it is certainly worth several hours of visitors' time. For exemple, one unique resident in the Oceanarium is a sunfish, a species rarely kept in aquariums because it is so difficult to care for. The main tank features a plethora of aquarium standards: sharks, eels, rays and schooling fish. It is perhaps fitting that, given Portugal's long history as a seafaring nation, the exhibits cover every major ocean on the globe, with an Arctic exhibit, an Atlantic Ocean tank, a tropical Indian Ocean habitat, and tanks housing species from the Pacific's temperate waters."

If with small children the extra attractions are not worthy to be paid, as by the time you make the circuit, the children will be tired. Apparently my little daughter appreciated more the pinguins and the \"tropical forest\" than the fishes. The fishes and the ambiance are quite nice for a rainy afternoon. Children up to 3 do not pay, and to 12 pay 9 euros. An adult pays 14. In my opinion the only drawback of this attraction is not having a cafeteria middle course to rest a bit the little ones. As far the attraction itself, far better than the London one."

This establishment is located in a modern and rather drab building in the Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es and can, to my knowledge, only be reached on foot via a river promenade, or by the cable car. The signage is abysmal, but the locals are helpful. The amenities include two souvenir shops (shopping at one gives you a 15% discount at the other), an Italian bistro with outdoor seating, and a tranquil garden.At \u20ac15 per adult it's not the Lisbon's cheapest attraction, but it's well worth the price.The central exhibit is a three storey tank, opening at the top into various land habitats, and housing flora and fauna from all the world's oceans. Included are attractive fish like the great white shark and the Europe's only captive sunfish, but also animals like penguins and otters. The setup allows for some fascinating views. You can watch otters from above, floating on the surface, and if they dive, you can descend and see them swimming in the tank with ths fish.The corridors are lined with supplementary tanks housing fish, coral, jellyfish, starfish, anemonae... There is some multimedia, including a theatre showing a film on how the oceanarium is run (and how to perform surgery on fish!), a kids' playground with an ecological message, touch screens,sounds and tactile samples (including shark skin.) There is a small rainforest garden and, at the time of our visit, there was an exhibition of amphibians.The visitors' preferred activity, however, seems to be lounging on a carpeted floor, watching devil mantas, tiger sharks, and other exotic fish swim by.The sheer number of exhibits and the fascinating behaviour of animals make the oceanarium a full-day activity."

The experience was enhanced by the large script plaques describing the creatures and the philosophical reflections found on the walls.

Do bring your walking shoes, as it is a good walk round as well. At 14 euros per adult give yourself plenty of time here. The exhibits are well laid out and in species order. Photography is allowed, but no flash. If you have ISO function on your camera you will need a high ISO to get any decent shots, as most areas are very dark. I took movies in the end as stills were difficult as the fish move much faster than you think! It's beautiful and restful to watch and each exhibit has a little bench to rest on, so you can take your time. I think it is quite expensive to get in to the oceanariums, so it will need to be budgeted for in your holiday expenses. There were few exhibits outside just a few penguins and otters . All in all worth a visit."

The recreations of different ocean ecosystems offer a unique glimpse at marine life in various parts of the world. It is the huge main tank that offers up-close-and-personal views, from different angles, of the nearly 25,000 fish. Many display the beauty of nature. Others, e.g., the Mola Mola (Ocean Sunfish), are popular with visitors for their more unusual appearance (a face only a mother could love). One of my favorite exhibits was the family of sea otters that reside in the facility. I was with a group of mature adults from a cruise ship, and we loved the Oceanarium, but part of the joy was in watching the many children who were visiting. This is a family-oriented attraction, great for all ages. It is easily accessible by public transportation. There is a nice gift shop. Other shops and eateries are within easy walking distance.

It is located in the area of Lisbon which was developed for Expo 98. This area is serviced by the Red Metro line.The admission fee for adults is \u20ac14, though you can get tickets at a reduced rate if you buy online. At the entrance pay the extra \u20ac2.50 for the audio tour. As we did not see any signs advertising this option we missed out. It would be well worth the extra few euro, as information signs inside the exhibit, while bilingual, are fairly basic.Staff we encountered were very helpful, and could speak English. We visited in late December and encountered no queues. The whole place was spotlessly clean. The toilets at the exit area were surprisingly small for what must be a very popular attraction, and would not have been much the better for some air freshener.We were two adults, and took about an hour and forty five minutes to see everything. Expect to spend considerably longer if you have children with you. The Oceanarium is really well designed and laid out. It is very easy to move through and the whole experience was very pleasant. The sunfish are a real treat. My own personal favourites were the delicate dragon fish. The lower levels were a real surprise, with the diversity of sea creatures on display. It was a particular delight to watch the Penguins and Sea Otters swimming under water.There is the usual gift shop and restaurant on the way out. There are also plenty of restaurants in the immediate area, with the large Vasco Da Gama Shopping Centre, complete with food court, close by. If you intend to visit Lisbon, take the time to travel out to Oceanario de Lisboa. Probably best to set aside half a day. There are 450 different species of one sort or another to be seen. So whether you are on the lookout for sharks, sea horses or starfish, there will be plenty for you to enjoy. And don't forget your camera."

The main tank is stunning over so many floors and it was spectacular just sitting on the floor at the bottom watching the creatures in the water. The place is well laid out and good for the price.

One could see few sharks, various other species of fish, penguins. Of special interest I would say is the \"Indian Ocean\" section with its coral reefs ... it is fascinatingly colourful. Part of the main tank and of the smaller, thematic aquariums are actually under water level ... so it's very interesting to see how this structure was designed, starting with its underground level. I found the entrance fee a bit high, but perhaps that's due to the high costs related to constantly maintaining the proper habitats for all the creatures hosted here. Also, there is a short movie presented in the small cinema room, which goes into details about this work and the other research done here."

It shows me a world that I am completely unfamiliar with and mostly terrified of, but safely contained within a giant glass tank. Which is essentially what I found this 'oceanarium' to be, a giant tank with possible the biggest sun-fish(??) I have ever seen!!! Honestly, if it was swimming towards you, it looked like the MOON. For 14 euros it was pricier than what I would have liked to spend on it, but definitely worth a visit if you love fish! The structure is very much centered around the giant tank in the middle so as you are walking you get a 360 view of the tank which is so big that you can't see the other side of it. Other smaller exhibits are on the side and one of my favourite was the Indian sea one with the exceptionally coloured fishes. One downer...I didn't get to see the otters :( Definitely worth a go-see if you are looking to get inside from the rain as my group was looking to do!"

You can walk along at the different windows and from each of it you get another view at the ocean sunfishs, the different kind of sharks, the rays, especially the manta ray and all the other bigger and smaller, sometimes colourful fishs. They had also two very cute sea otters, eating fish while passing by, little penguins, puffins, jellyfishs and many more. Outside there is a big souvenir shop and you got some possibilities for eating and drinking.The aquarium is one of the \"must be done\" in Lisboa!

Maybe that was why it seemed crowed. $15 Euro each to get in seemed a bit pricey after only spending an hour or so trying to get close enough to the glass for a good look. Tanks seemed very well maintained and roomy and the central tank area is impressive. Penguins, Pacific otters and the large sharks and rays are the stars here. I would recommend to a friend but to find an off day or a quiet part of a day to avoid the crowds."

We had this consigned to our \"things to do on a rainy day in Lisbon\" list but we decided it would be a nice way to end a long day exploring the city. It was fantastic!A short train ride and then another short walk through a pleasant, modern part of the city led us here. One minor flaw is the modern, bland building suggests nothing of the aquarium within.As soon as you enter you encounter the main central tank that they build the exhibit around. It is the \"one world, one ocean\" idea and is a large tank consisting of many species including sharks, sunfish, shoals of mackerel, rays and many other interesting specimen. We stayed staring into this tank for almost an hour, getting lost in the blue glow and hypnotic movement of the animals. The areas are divided into regions, each one with different animals, temperatures, plants and atmospheres. Keeps it all interesting!I really appreciated how much the information focused on conservation and the environment and hope they improve that further.One thing I loved is how multi sensual (if that term exists) it was. Combined with amazing sights you got to enjoy the sounds and even smells of the maritime world, made it all feel real. It was a beautiful break from the urban reality outside and something I'd recommend for those of all ages!One small thing was that some of the signage was missing or incorrect. A small detail though.If you love animals and/or the ocean you will love this!"

The layout with a central tank which can be seen from different angles all around at two levels with many smaller side aquaria around it is very good and you get the impression that you see many tanks. The same layout has also be successfully copied by others and is functioning well. The variety of fishes and all other sorts of marine animals is very good, spanning from arctic to tropical areas. It was a pity to see too many of the fishes having infections on fins and parts of the body. They should be replaced.

It is a great place to take kids, as it is entertaining and it has a very high value on the educational part.The sheer amount of animals inside is mesmerizing. You will see animals you never thought to see in such enviroment.You can kind of travel the world a see the most famous species of aquatic animals, and some birds too.There are pleanty of places to take spetacular photos and/or selfies with or without animals in the frame.Cons:The price, I think it is a bit expensive, if you are going with more than 2 people it can drill a hole in your pocket. If you are going with kids and they don't like it or if they are afraid of dark spaces you are in for hellish ride, as the tour is normaly long and sometimes there are spaces with low light so they don't disturb the animals but at the same time make kids unconfortable.So to resume, it is a very nice place to go and I urge you all to go, just be aware of the costs and be careful if your kids tend not to like this kind of places."

Take metro to the Vasco de Gamma Shopping Centre and walk around the shops.2. Stop off on the top floor for a mid-morning custard tart and juice at the food court. Great views of the river.3. Go to the cinema on the top floor and play air hockey or if you wish watch a movie the majority of them are in English and sub-titled in Portuguese although be careful with the under 12 movies they are in Portuguese!4. If hungry have lunch in the food court lots of variety food to suit everyone.5. Go to 1st floor entrance facing river and walk towards river turn left at river walk 5 minutes then get on cable car going opposite way it stops outside Oceanario. Great ride kids will love it.6. Visit Oceanario it is fantastic the best one I have been in in Europe better than Barcelona."

The main tank is enormous and just beautiful with some of the best fish collection ever seen with lots of sharks, stingrays etc but also sun fish, a truly impressive giant. The other recreations of the oceans are also amazing. They even recreated Antarctic sea with mini glaciers for the Penguins, there is a small tropical forest and many secondary tanks that are just beautiful. If you like the sea don't miss it. Great to do also the cable car just outside (ticket is extra) which seems to work only at weekends."

I recommend that you do not stop when you walk in the main door - yes the tank is spectacular, but I assure you there are many many viewing windows. Everyone crowds around the first few areas, but about halfway around the circle you will find windows with no one. We sat down and enjoyed watching all the antics of the fish without a crowd. If you have a fish identification book at home, it is worth packing along. There is so much to see that the book would be helpful."

We ate in the cafe and found it to be convenient and a good value. We also found some bargains in the shop. I would recommend it for anyone who likes sea life.Only pet peeve is we found it difficult to find the entrance coming from the Oriente metro stop.

Throughout the first floor there are an additional 25 thematic aquariums with each of the habitats' own characteristics.[8]The Lisbon Oceanarium is one of the few aquariums in the world to house a sunfish due to their unique and demanding requirements for care.

There's an antarctic zone that has penguins and flying birds (terns I think), a pacific zone, a rainforest zone and atlantic zone. The star attraction are the two sea otters that are unbelivably cute - guaranteed to be a winner with the kids I think.The aforementioned internal tank has all sorts of creatures in it - sharks, shoals of fish, devil rays, small fish, big fish. Each perspective on it gives you something new to see. Downstairs the layout is similar, with lots of smaller tanks too highlighting different species. The coral and anenome displays are amazing. There is also a temporary exhibit as well as the permanent one, but this was closed when we visited. There's a perfectly good cafe and gift shop too.

The area in which the aquarium is located (within a few hundred yards from the Vasco de Gama shopping mall), is quite an empty big space, with just the aquarium, a large theatre/stadium, and the shopping mall. So if you're planning on walking around, not much else to see/do.The aquarium isn't the best I've seen. There are smaller tanks that you walk around in rooms that showcase parts of the central tank containing the most of the aquatic species- sharks, rays, boney fish, schooling fish, etc. There wasn't much else in the way of a good showcase of the aquatic life there. Although the aquarium itself felt relatively new and well kept in comparison to other aquariums I've been to- e.g. UK Birmingham Sea life centre. In comparison to Sydney Sea life centre, there wasn't much comparison, as Australia wins hands down.As for the price, \u20ac14 was a bit too much for an aquarium which we walked around within 1 hour 15 minutes."

In and of itself, these made the visit worth it. The main tank in the center though was incredible. We saw a large range of fish, many of which were more exotic to an American like me. Many of the fish, rays, etc would swim right next to the glass boundary. That was also pretty cool.The oceanario is in the Parque Das Nacoes area which is the newest part of Lisbon with great transportation, shopping, etc. Worth a visit."

The problem is that the \"Big Ocean\" due to obvious reasons actually is quite small,- and it soon gets really repetetive. The division of the climatic zones, with fauna and birds etc in that setteing, could be really cool,- but the exebition hardly contains anything. Ex.. The \"tTopical Rainforest walk\" was just a walk on a slippery wooden path, with a few plants. Nothing else. The walk through the Oceanario was very dark, narrow and at times a bit claustrofobic. Lots of shrieking kids...On a whole,- very repetetive, a bit boring, thin exebitions, but the Otters were really well displayed!"

If you love fish and all sorts of sea life you'll love this place. First of all, it has this huge circular aquarium and everything else is placed around it. All the oceans are represented. The penguins were cute as well as otters. There is a gift shop at the exit, plenty of restrooms etc. Outside the ticket box you have this big waterfall, so cool. I definitely recommend a visit!"

Then there is the main aquarium. I know a lot of aquarium boast about how big their tanks are but this is exceptional. Apparently this is the second largest aquarium in Europe and I can believe that quite easily. Then there are special habitats such as a chilled area where there are penguins and puffins. There is even ice produced to try and make it more authentic. This is a great place to visit. Not just fun for the kids but for everyone. I cannot recommend this place enough."

As my wife has master degree in Biology, it is a must to visit oceanarium or simillar while we are on one of the city breaks.Oceanarium Lisboa is perfect with one HUGE tank in the middle that is cornered by thematical ones (each representing one ocean). There is big variety of sea animals (and floora) inclouding manta. Pricewise it's on higher end (eur 16 with temporary expo).I would skip current temporary expo (turtles) as there were too few of them to make it worthwhile, but at least info about them is detailed enough. Tip: While there jump on to Telecabine Lisboa the view from it is perfect"

It was a small aquarium with lot of fish and one giant turtle. The staff said that there at lots more but that they were hiding? It was a small aquarium not much room to hide. So not worth the extra money.The main aquarium has some nice sharks, and unique fish. The main area circles around one big aquarium and that is pretty much it. It is nice to see but not worth getting there from downtown and spending that much money unless you are a marine lover. You can use the time and money elsewhere. Didn't find it that spectacular."

You are only allowed one visit (specified on tickets) so cannot go for lunch and come back like we can do at our sea life centres. There is no interaction and is basically a glorified fish tank. Yes I understand the need to highlight the impact humans have on the world with what we do to the ocean, and as a family who have visited a lot of the sea life centres in the uk we have done this. However, our kids although enjoyed seeing the creatures found it pretty boring compared to previous experience of aquariums. What disappointed us even more was the temporary display of sea turtles. My kids have seen them before elsewhere and when they did someone did a talk etc. about them whilst visiting. Didn't think the extra for this was worth it. So if you enjoy staring at various marine life through a glass then its okay but we wouldn't recommend it."

The main aquarium in the center is absolutely huge and the variety of marine life that live together in it is mind-blowing. Huge sting rays swimming along sharks and schools of smaller fish swimming together in a three story tank that gives a surrounding impression when you stand up close. There are also a lot of smaller tank exhibits in addition to some penguins and otters that live outside. While I was there I saw a special exhibition on giant turtles that was also a real treat. All of the turtles were rescues and we were told there are plans to release them back into the wild, so I don't know how long it will be there. I did not get the audio guide and felt nothing lacking from my experience that was mostly just being visually stunned. It was easy to find taking the subway and strikes me as an excellent activity for kids."

Although it would certainly be a wonderful place to bring kids - it's also very interesting for adults. The whole place has a consistent conservation theme which educates without being heavy-handed in any way. The building is structured very well so that you \"visit\" different oceans and learn about the habitats in each. Right now they have a temporary exhibit with sea turtles which costs a bit extra. I love sea turtles so I bought the extra ticket, but was a bit disappointed with the number of turtles and trying to find them. Only worth it if this is a big interest for you. Everything else was top notch - even the cafeteria! Great food at reasonable prices."

Chose the one that goes directly to the ticket machines since that is shorter. This is not the case if you are looking for Group discount or any other kind of discount. I would actually suggest buying tickets online the day before.Although the aquarium is HUGE and spectacular, I must admit I founds the crowds a bit off-putting. It was hard to get decent views of the main dome and most of the exhibits. The Penguin compounds was good to see but the special attraction of the Turtles was a waste of the extra we paid for the ticket.I would recommend only going for the permanent exhibit and not both permanent and temporary.Your kids will have loads of fund though - with the central dome and sharks and divers and some really ancient looking fish called the \"Bone fish\"!"

Also having a big turtle swimming underneath your feet is quite a fun experience. Couple of tips: Buy ticket online, the line can be pretty long. Save some time, at times you will want just to sit down and enjoy the serenity of the main tank. There are some spots that are crowded with viewers but there are also quieter spots to enjoy the experience alone. Also - when approaching the main tank the first time, there can be quite a lot of people there, so I would recommend to move on as the rush of people gets quieter basically at the next viewing spot."

We all agreed that even if all the fish and plants are cool (we even found Nemo!) otters are the best thing you can see there. If they are not in their area wait patiently or just come back in few minutes - you'll not regret it!"

If you go as a family you will be surprised how much money you have to pay!The aquarium is built around a huge round tank, which you will explore from every possible angle. My highlight was the ocean sunfish. That was really cool to see how big they are! Otherwise if you are without kids you will not need more than 1 1/2 hours to see pretty much everything and not being in a haste. The gift shop is great, with nice things. So all in all it is a nice place to escape the heat and the location is very nice and completely different from the rest of lisbon. So you should definitley go there some time during your trip."

The admission for an adult was 16 euro to get into the main Aquarium and the special exhibit, giant turtles while we were there, we didn't think that was too bad. The main tank is vast with lots of places to peek in from different angles, it has all types of fish from sharks and rays to schools of smaller fish swirling round. The tank can be viewed from different levels giving a different perspective each time. The otters and penguins in their climatic environments is a nice tough and a good opportunity to get up close. The smaller tanks all offer interesting fish, frogs, crabs and anemones.  There are informative facts and information in English on every display along with interactive display areas for the children. Clean toilets are available along with a shop offering the usual overpriced stuffed animals, pencils, rubbers and other useless tat! The main issue is the number of people there and getting close enough to see everything you want, being patient definitely does pay off though. The local shopping centre is huge with fast food outlets along with indian, salad and sushi available on the upper floor and a supermarket on the lower floor."

Then, my parents came to Portugal and I was a college student when Lisbon was growing up a bit chaotically. After many years of coming back to visit my nephews and in-laws for Xmas and the summer holidays, I became a permanent resident in Lisbon. What a difference from when I was a student! A city full of activities, rhythm, places to discover, events, well-cared museums (even if not cheap according to the Portuguese standards of living) suited for every taste, age, want, and budget. The Ocean\u00e1rio is well-known, especially if you want a kiss from a seal, but there are other places to visit and rest, in Lisbon and all year round around its natural seashore you will find small cities and spots (some of them inevitable such as Cascais, Sintra, Mafra, Ericeira, Estoril, Guincho, Tro\u00eda...), all listed and described in the travel literature online or in books. Plus, for what I reckon as a non-tourist now, tourists are above all under the spell of foods and the vistas... charmed by a white city, thriving with life, water, fire, wind, and earth . Codfish, sardines, ice creams, more or less traditional like the famous Pasteis de Nata...Come to visit Lisbon, min. 3-day trip or, for the whole package, at least 5 to 7 days: forget stress as a tourist (the other working Lisbonenses will carry your burden) and stop counting calories or checking on your levels of good cholesterol!"

The base tank (aquarium) in the middle accompanies us through the whole journey and it makes us feel so ... insignificant yet calm and quiet. You can either be romantic and take your girl/boyfriend with you, or make it a family/friends trip. Everyone fits in, and everyone enjoys it.

It's a sea turtle exhibition that also has a lot of fish. It's definitely worth the extra \u20ac2/person to see. As for the rest of the exhibit, it was really something else. Having all the four oceans in one was very cool! Their main aquarium was huge and had a massive sunfish in it! I've never seen a sunfish in real life so this was something else! They also had a very big manta ray, some large sand sharks, guitar fish and a variety of other fish and unique sharks too. They had a very large giant grouper which was cool, and there were multiple angles from two different floors in which you could see the tank. There were four other 'ocean' exhibits being pacific, atlantic, indian and arctic. In the atlantic they had sea otters which was also a unique exhibit. This was really cool for the kids. They all loved the sea otters. They had two different varieties of penguins, and again, many species of fish. The Lisbon Oceanarium is definitely a must see when in Lisbon and is a great retreat for a hot day! It's a great place for families with children of all ages too. Our daughter spent a good time in a double stroller and we had no problems getting around. There are ample elevators and the staff are very accommodating to make sure that you can get in and around with ease."

I did not think it stacked up to the Baltimore or Monterey Aquariums in the USA, but it was a very impressive place. My favorite memory were these tiny, delicate sea dragons, which I had never seen before - lovely! They promote their sea otters but the day we went they were nowhere to be found. They also have a temporary exhibit on sea turtles which I recommend is worth the extra few euros.

I was not that overly impressed with this one, I felt it was not very informative, a bit small and lacking any clear theme. The central tank was massive with an abundant array of species. I'm pretty sure kids will love this as it is huge.Generally speaking the walk around the aquarium centered around different views of this tank.There's a rain forest exhibit which is just that, an exhibit for Penguins and birds ( I though the space was pretty small for flying birds) , sea otters which were very cute and plenty of Jellyfish. Overall it was pretty good but I have seen better. They could really do with some staff giving talks or taking questions on the animals on show to keep the kids , and adults alike, occupied. It may become a bit repetitive for kids. I've seen places where they have interaction such as feeding and touching for the kids which is always fun."

The rest of the aquarium was reasonably interesting but unfortunately there were a fair number of school parties so the place seemed a bit over crowded. The cafe served a fixed price meal 9.80\u20ac which was good value and tasty.I think children would really enjoy it ...but only if they are prepared to tear themselves away from their gadgets and enjoy looking and learning.

I was absolutely thrilled with this place and I would highly recommend it. We spent a little over an hour moving through the aquarium although you could spend a lot more time there if you are with children or if you read all of the descriptions (fortunately the displays are all in English as well as Portuguese). There is one main tank in the centre which you have the opportunity to view again and again. Then there are four additional main tanks on each corner of the building, with 'above-the-water' and 'below-the-water' viewing areas, featuring Sea Otters and a variety of Penguins (amongst other creatures). These represent the 5 oceans. Then there are smaller tanks dotted throughout with additional specimens, from Sea Dragons to Blue Poison Dart Frogs and more. The extra Sea Turtle exhibition was probably not worth the money although it was included in our tickets. The on-site restaurant is fantastic, the food quantities were more than generous and the price was unbelievably cheap. We couldn't believe the bargains we got on two full adult-sized meals with all of the trimmings, desserts, AND drinks. It was the cheapest meal I have ever had at a proper attraction in my entire life. And all of the food was delicious. You can not go wrong with a day out to the Oceanario!!"

You get to see so many animals from both above and below. There weren't a lot of people there, so you can take as long as you like. Really a lot of fun - and I love aquariums. They really care about the animals and rehabilitation in Lisbon. The aquarium is in the area developed for Expo 98 (I think) and the whole waterfront area is quite nice. Definitely one of the nicest days we've spent on vacation."

We have to say, we weren't disappointed in any way. First port of call was the temporary sea turtle exhibition which is a nice addition to the trip and worth the extra \u20ac3 on the entry fee. Then onto the main exhibition area - this is based around a large central tank and there are plenty of large viewing areas to watch the numerous sharks, rays and other fish from. In addition, at each of the four corner there is a themed zone - these contained puffins/guillemots; penguins; sea otters; rain forest/fish from the Indian Ocean. All in all this is a cool place to spend a couple of hours and with the lovely esplanade looking out on the Vasco De Gama bridge and the shopping centre, it's a nice way to spend the day out of the hustle and bustle of the old city."

However.....If you have visited The Deep, this is a similar concept in that it is a large central tank where you start at the top and experience the Atlantic ocean literally from top to bottom. However, the difference here is you experience many other habitats - Antarctic (complete with penguins and Puffins), the rainforest, an area with sea otters and much, much more. There are currently two entrance fees of 13 euros (main exhibit) or 16 euros for the main exhibit and a temporary exhibit of sea turtles which I thoroughly enjoyed.It is really easily reached by Metro (Oriente station), train, five minutes from the airport by taxi (about 5 euros) and is part of the old 1998 Expo site, so a great place to spend half to a full day either exploring just the Oceanarium or for a full day the other close by attractions (Vasco Da Gama Bridge, cable car, many parks, large shopping centre and much more)."

It is located in a very upscale area across the street from the modern Vasco da Gama shopping mall. We went to the mall first for lunch at the food court on on the 3rd floor. We ate at Joshua's Grill (next to Haagen Dazs Ice Cream). They have delicious middle eastern salads. We then went to the Oceanario and I must admit, I'm not a fan of aquariums either, but it was worth visiting nonetheless. I enjoyed watching the fish swimming by in schools. Lots of young children were there touring and children will be children - noisy and running around. However, when the schools in Portugal are on break, I assume it is less hectic."

Frankly, we did not fall in love with Lisbon The travel books describe it as another San Francisco, but sadly, it is run- down, filled with bums sleeping permanently in abandoned store-front doorways, and for me, lacked a sense of romance and vibe. If you like San Francisco, go to San Francisco. That said, it was rainy on and off most of our stay, and pouring buckets on the day we went to the aquarium. As our hotel did not inspire us to stay there, we checked on the Internet for things to do in the rain. Fortunately, we selected the aquarium. We have been to other aquariums, but do not put aquariums on our \"to do\" list when we travel. This aquarium experience was awesome. For some reason, it struck just the right cord. We had a good time. The ticket line moved quickly, and we spent about 10 minutes in line. Tickets were pricey, but everything we did in and around Lisbon seemed outrageously, as in 'you've got to be kidding me', over-priced. Yes, there were several groups of young children. But, they were well-controlled and it was easy to move around and past them. The fish,frogs, penguins, coral, eel, etc. were awesome. Seeing the caretaker enter the tank to feed them was very interesting. I would see the aquarium again if I returned to Lisbon (but I will not return to Lisbon as it is not on my top ten enjoyable cities list). My advice: if you think the aquarium is expensive and do not recommend it on that basis, then do not go to Lisbon at all, as we found everything to be very expensive in Lisbon."

Designed by American architect Peter Chermeyeff, it rises from the river and is reached by a footbridge. It is a deep-sea diving experience without any of the risks, with about 25,000 fish, seabirds, and mammals in an enormous central tank that is the size of four Olympic-sized swimming pools. Visitors can look into it from different levels for close-ups of the various creatures, including different species of sharks"

There are some subsidiary tanks for various regions but these were less impressive along wi some specialized tanks on the lower level that were also fairly standard. They have a lot of otter memorabilia and is part of their film of the history of the place but they either do not actually have these animals or I completely missed them.

Walking through each, self-guided, you would swear you were in a distant country. Some of the fish tanks are set in black, so one can see the bountiful types and colors of fish indigenous to various parts of the world. Jellyfish are transparent, and the only way they can be seen are in a tank with black walls. They are graceful and beautiful. A huge tank filled with larger species such as sharks is hard to leave - mesmerizing. One can sit and watch all day. It is the second largest aquarium in the world, accessible downtown by a tram that follows the river. We got lost, and a kind woman actually sat with us past her stop so she could take us back to the right place. We shared photos of our grandchildren and left with hugs.

The sharks are always a hit and the schools of fish swimming in synchronization will always amaze. And when a harbor seal decides to dive down and visit the fish, you'll laugh out loud. Even the penguins get frisky some times. Don't get me wrong, the Oceanario is not just entertaining; there's plenty of opportunity to learn about sea life and many habitats. But who can resist when a sting ray floats close to the glass, does a fast flip, unceremoniously shows you its underside and then \"flies\" away with its tail \"wagging\""

Don't stop at the first sighting of the main aquarium, everyone does and you don't get a decent view, carry on round, and you'll have about 10-15 other unobstructed views of the same. I personally really enjoyed the otters, collecting ice cubes and holding them on their chest, playing with them, awesome."

It has a huge central tank with cool fish. But it has displays from all the oceans of the world, and it's really well-laid out. We went because the children we were with demanded it, but it was definitely worth going to."

For those who want something different in Lisbon, want a cool fresh spot, near the river and so cultural as the centre of Lisbon has to offer, must visit Ocean\u00e1rio.In a zone where you can walk with your friends, take a good meal or a drink with your friends in PArque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es, after or before you can enter Oceanarium one of the possible things to do in this place. Ocenarium has several species from fish, to turtles, sharks, octopus, Penguins, Sea-lions and so on. Even when the heat strikes on Lisbon here you will forget the heat cause all the water in the tanks or aquariums sometime will make you think you are in the middle of the ocean or in the middle of the snow. It have a cost to enter but it's totally worth it in my opinionPara quem procura algo diferente em Lisboa daquilo que o centro hist\u00f3rico de Lisboa oferece, tem aqui uma boa alternativa. Numa zona perto do rio, com sombra, relativamente mais fresca que algumas zonas na Baixa Lisboeta. Com caf\u00e9s, restaurantes por perto, sitios de lazer, j\u00e1 teve mais mas isso \u00e9 outro tema.No Ocean\u00e1rio paga-se mas todos os tanques e aqu\u00e1rios fazem por vezes esquecer o calor da rua nos dias muito quentes e a pessoa sente-se confortavel. Aqui encontra-se desde tubar\u00f5es, pinguins,tartarugas, Raias, cavalos marinhos, le\u00f5es marinhos, peixes, entre tantos outros. o Pre\u00e7o que se paga \u00e9 compensat\u00f3rio e pode sempre no fim comprar lembran\u00e7as que lembram o tempo ali passado. facilmente se passa nesta zona uma tarde."

I guess a lot of other people had the same idea as the queue was really long- but it moved along quickly. I got a ticket that included the temporary exhibit of the sea turtles. My only disappointment was that I never saw any of them- maybe they were hiding! The main large tank is amazing- sharks swimming right up close to you. There are a lot of species to see. The crowds make it difficult to get to see some of them but if you're patient to wait eventually you'll get close to the glass to see. It didn't really live up to my expectations but I'm not really sure why. I was expecting something more out of the experience. Maybe something different other than lots of glass tanks to look at (but what I'm not sure- I think my expectations were very high after reading loads of good reviews). Overall I enjoyed it. A small note also, there are also lots of things nearby, including a huge shopping mall with loads of shops and lots of restaurant / food options."

Lots to see at the areas shooting off from the main tank as you move around from puffins and birdlife to sea mammals like others. Also lots of information on the exhibits. well worth adding to your trip and would be a great place to chill down on a hot day. If you arrive by Metro Check out the station front as you come out at the Parque das Nacoes which built for expo 98. The station name is Oriente and is quite impressive in it's own right. Also we would recommend the sky ride over the water from the Vasco de Gama Tower at north of the park down to the Oceanario for a great view over the river, bridge and the park itself.

Not exactly the easiest place to find - but once you have come out of the metro at Oriente on the red line and turned right and walked along the waterfront behind the shopping mall for about 10 minutes you will find it... follow the cable cars they run from it.It was a lovely way to spend a rather wet morning in Lisbon. The main massive tank was amazing but felt a bit let down by the star attraction and my reason for visiting as there were very few turtles to view....either that or they were hiding along with the sea otters!There are several levels to the Oceanario with many place/alcoves to sit and watch nature up close.. you could spend hours in there just taking it all in.......and don't forget your camera.Vasa de Gama Bridge can also be viewed from here truly a magnificent piece of engineering. Tip don't buy tickets before you go pointless - you still have to queue just the same and with lisboa card you get a discount."

As the other reviews say it has a huge main tank in the middle with lots of interesting fish and then around the sides it focuses on the different parts of the worlds oceanic life. The highlight for me was the Sea otters and the devil ray, oh and the Sun fish. Extraordinary!There is an interesting video on the daily routine of running the aquarium and feeding the fish. The only thing I thought could be improved was more informative and interactive activities. A huge disappointment was the sea turtle exhibition. I learnt more about sea turtles by watching 'Finding Nemo' than I did there. You didn't really get to see them either. Nothing interactive or cinematic. The turtles are there for rehabilitation and recovery before going back to there natural habitat. Its not a very comprehensive exhibition and not worth the extra 3 euro in my opinion."

The main aquarium is HUGE and contains some monsters of animals.I'll go against the grain and say that the temporary exhibition (sea turtles) wasn't really worth it: you barely get to see them, even more because of the many people in a relative small space: when a turtle can be seen (they're sometimes rather \"hidden\" behind the decor panels and stuff), people immediately flock around it and sometimes keep standing there for minutes, so you can barely get a glimpse.Be aware of a few things:- On their flyers they say \"get off at metro station X\", so you get the impression that it's nearby, but it's a ten minute walk from the metro station, and the route isn't drawn on the Oceanario flyer. Ask locals for the way: it's not very hard to find but you just need to know in what direction to walk. - We went on a Monday because that's the day when they're feeding most animals. We had created some sort of \"schedule\" so we would see most feeding sessions based on the timings provided on the flyer. Too bad that in reality, they don't seem to be following those timings very closely, so we missed most of them anyway."

The aquarium has 5 themed areas on two levels, each with it's own marine life. Upon entering, you stumple upon the biggest tank in which you will find a great array of fishes; Ocean sunfish, no less then 7 species of sharks, 3 species of guitarfish, barracudas, groupers and 6 species of ray including the only Devil ray kept in an European collection. This ''Global Ocean'' tank represents all of the worlds oceans and is the park's main attraction. During your visit, you'll get to a view into this tank from multiple huge acryl windows from all four sides.But there's a lot more to see. Sea otters (the only ones in Europe!), Magellanic penguins and different kinds of shore birds all have their home here and they all have a terrestrial viewing on the upper floor and an underwater viewing on the ground floor - and are living alongside sharks! Many smaller aquaria are found on the ground floor and feature a fascinating arrange of species. Jellyfish, giant octopus, cuddlefish, Japanese spider crab, weedy sea dragons, sea horses, anglerfish, flatfish, wolf-eels, 5 species of moray eels and ratfish are just some of the creatures you'll come across here. And ofcourse there is an oustanding coral reef display with the most colourfull of fish. And the best part is, while watching the sea otters, penguins or tropical fish, in the background you might see the inhabitants of the huge tank pass by as the aquaria themself are seperated only by acryl windows!The temporary exhibit ''Sea turtles: The Journey'' is also an amazing piece of art. A circular-shaped aquarium in which you can watch turtles and fish as they swim beside, above or even under you!"

The displays were OK but not quite as good as some of the other Oceanarium I have visited around the world. The only memorable item for me was the enormous Sun Fish, which I had never seen before. The entrance fee of 13 Euro was a bit expensive in my view and I felt that I hadn\u2019t had value for my money."

We were lucky enough to be in the Aquarium when the otters were being fed. They were amazingly cute and it was a joy to watch them play with each other and feed. The highlight for us was when one of the otters stood up to take her food with her little paws directly from the lady feeding her. So cute!

In the meantime I visited a lot of similar ocean parks (Monaco, Atlanta, Singapore, Barcelona, Sydney,..), but in my opinion the Lisboa one is the best. This time I came with kids and they were thrilled.The connected concept with 4 different tanks, from 4 oceans and their own flora and fauna, leading to the one common gigantic tank is nowhere seen. A lot of amusement, scientific things, and great fish to see.Look for the sun fish, the biggest fish in the world, it's amazing. Great sharks, jelly fish,...penguins,...Afford around 2 hours. Have in mind, the Oceanario is in the remote, north-east new part of town, and beside it, there are other nice things to see and do there (cable car, the longest European bridge \"Vasco de Gama\", the same name enormous shopping mall), so plan from half up to a full day in this part of the city."

There are all the characteristics found in all the different seas, every single tank with different temperatures and surround. From Ocean to Indian to all the rest. Even the North pole areas for penguins around is literally very cold to stay near so they could feel home.Wow, I was impressed. Thank you to all the staff on the back of house for keeping such a wonderful place in perfect condition.Keep it up, I will surely return in a couple of yrs may be beforeMark"

Entrance fee was reasonable given how much there is to see.It takes the form of one incredible central tank with tons of different fish/sharks swimming around and interacting. You wander round this on the lower levels, whilst the upper level is divided into four different areas to reflect different ecosystems. So there's a penguin area (with individually named and tagged penguins throwing themselves in the air), an area with three very friendly sea otters, a humid rainforest area etc...There are also temporary added galleries but we didn't visit them - to be honest the main exhibition felt like enough.Near the Oceanario you can also rent bikes by the half hour or hour to go for a cycle along the coast and see the different parks and buildings. Lovely way to spend 30 mins!"

Well my concerns were ill founded. Aside from the fact that there are many different tanks including an entirely separate turtle section, the ocean tank is actually several tanks meshed together to give the appearance of one giant tank. Sharks, sun fish, groupers, tuna and a whole load of other fish I don't know all swim together in a huge centre area. Oh, and a Manta Ray. There are 2 floors and about 16 viewing sections, plus outdoor bits with otters, puffins, penguins and the like. Most adorable. My only concern is that some of the smaller indoor tanks are a little too small, and that perhaps the turtles didn't like being walked over, but I guess it's better than being hunted in the name of some non-existent medicinal benefit as seems to befall many of these unfortunate creatures. Worth a visit for sure."

It is the biggest in Europe and has the most magnificent displays. it has one enormous central tank that you walk around from top to bottom in a spiral way. There are numerous smaller displays on the opposite walls as you descend. The fish without exception look healthy and the tanks are spotless. Very interesting and well worth a visit."

We were not disappointed - we saw both the temporary (sea turtles) and permanent exhibits. The scale of the central tank and variety of marine life contained within are enchanting and awe inspiring. I haven't been to an aquarium in a while, but I was amazed by how many species could cohabit peacefully - prey and predator species alike. I absolutely fell in love with the pacific and antarctic displays (penguins and sea otters) - they were so funny and entertaining and being able to see above and below the water was unique and fantastic and I appreciated how much of an effort they went to to enrich the animals' environments and make them as spacious and realistic as possible. Highly, highly recommend spending a few hours here whether you are young or old."

Our oceans are in trouble and this oceanarium does an excellent job simply outlining the problems and how we can fix it.

Reasonable amount of English signage plus various languages available on audio players make it a good international visitor spot. Tickets are ridiculously annoying though - the queue to buy at the box office was enormous, partially because the automated ticket machines only take cash, and only in Euro note denominations of 5, 10, 20.

The aquarium was the best I've been to (including Sydney, Cape Town, London, La Coruna) the main tank was breath taking. All the other exhibits were interesting and very well designed. You can see penguins in a rocky sea shore setting and then drop down a level to see them diving down to fish - fantastic. The aquarium has a lovely cafe which was reasonably priced.

It turned out to be a good decision as there is plenty to see, enough to keep you occupied for at least 2-3 hours.The central tank is amazing, lots of viewing windows at every level so everyone gets the chance to see something. There are also smaller tanks with the most bizarre array of sea anenomes and other weird and wonderful creatures. We particularly enjoyed watching the puffins and otters.We really enjoyed our visit and were pleasantly surprised when we left it had stopped raining which gave us the chance to go on the cable car which is just behind the aquarium. There is quite a bit to do in this area; shops, bars & restaurants and a really nice boardwalk with great views across the river."

The main tank was spectacular and we loved watching the manta ray and sea otters.We don't have good Portuguese, but all of the information was in English too. As far as we could tell, once you have left there is no readmittance. You can see the main tank from many different points as you go round, and some of the side tanks you get to see twice - one above the water and once after. Make the most of each as you go round as there's no short cuts back for a second look without walking back round against the flow of people. Also, you're not allowed to eat inside the aquarium, although there are a couple of different cafes available before you go in."

Perhaps especially great for those that have not had a chance to visit a world class aquarium but i was left with a disappointing feeling that - despite some of the amazing creatures - more effort could be put into telling the 'deeper'' story of the worlds oceans and its threatened inhabitants. Some little people were totally enthralled; this would clearly be a great option for families where museums don't capture short attention spans. Decent transit access from central Lisbon, but a bit of a walk from the architecturally bold Oriente station and Vasco Da Gama shopping centre (10 min +). The rest of this newer waterfront neighbourhood (formerly a world Expo project) is a bit bleak."

The walk over to the aquarium was amazing as along the waterfront you could see groups of fish as well as huge, mutant, jellyfish everywhere. As far as we know it had nothing to do with the aquarium, they were just floating in the water wild. Once inside everything revolves around a giant central tank, so if the window you are trying to look through is crowded just take a few steps over and there will be another window for viewing. There were a lot of amazing fish in the tank but the giant sunfish was the craziest. They also had penguins, puffins, and sea otters in separate exhibits. Plan at least 2 to 3 hours for a visit."

It's so large with so many different types of fish. I couldn't help but think how much my nephews would have enjoyed going. As two adults the aquarium is really amazing and completely worth going to. It was so relaxing and I think had I been more jetlagged I could have fallen asleep watching the fish.One of the more amazing thing was the constant reminder of conservation of both the ocean and the fish who live there. Considering the overfishing, particularly cod, it was great to see the education about the impacts of not being conscience of what we are doing to our oceans. Only drawback is that it's a bit out of the way but I think worth the metro ride."

We stayed in Lisbon and got the Metro out, it cost a mere 1.40 euros one way. The cost to get in was 16 euros, what we expected. You can of course get discounts if you take a yellow bus tour etc but we didn't do that. From the moment of walking in we were in total amazement. I would agree with a previous review, the aquarium is set out wonderfully, all based around the huge, and I really mean huge tank in the middle. The centre tank has such a diverse selection of fish, you have a Mola Mola, manta ray, hovering barracuda etc. The exhibits outside of the tank include the penguin area, which had so many nooks and crannies for them and real ice. The favourite exhibit for me, purely for the cuteness sake has to be the sea otters, adorable is the only way you can describe them. When we saw them they were just chilling as they do. However, when you go on the lower level, you get to see them playing under water, just fantastic.We spent a couple of hours at least at the aquarium, and could have gone around again. Included within the 16 euros fee was the temporary exhibit of sea turtles, again totally awesome and well worth of the extra 3 euros. We didn't have children with us but still enjoyed it immensely. If you are in Lisbon, we would highly recommend a trip out to this wonderful place."

Sharks, rays and all kinds of sea going 'fish' in the biggest tank I've ever seen. Loads of 'bite sized' reading material and it was in English as well as Portugese. Really informative and educational. If you do nothing else - do this.

It is a fascinatingplace, where there is every kind of sea life from sea dragons to a shark.It is very well laid out with one main huge tank and various other smallertanks containing a vast amount of fish and corals. There are even areas for Indian ocean, australia etc and also cute otters and penguins. In the temporary exhibition area we were lucky to see a turtle amongst other sea creatures.We spend a very happy two and half hours there. There is also a short film on the workings of the oceanarium, which is very interesting. When you are tired from walking around there is a cafe on site which is a little pricey. The cost of visiting the oceanarium is 16 euro per adult which includes the temporary exhibition area(worth the extra few euro). Childrens tickets are 11 euro. This is somewhere that people of all ages can enjoy. It is truly an unfogetable experience and has to be one of the best oceanariums in europe. Also the area in which it is build is interesting as it is where expo 98 was held and there are lots of modern glass and steel buildings and a small marina there.The Vasco De Gama bridge is nearby and it an incredible feat of engineering. One of our party has a disability and there were very helpful staff on site who approached us and showed us to the various lifts/elevators for the different levels. Jim/Mary Moloney (Ireland)"

It's on the site of a 1998 world exhibition, and there are lots of other museums and attractions in the area, but this should be your main focus. The main tank is amazing - you can get mesmerized just watching all the various fish swim by. There are also four side tanks in environments that represent the North Atlantic coast, Antarctica, Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. In these environments, you can find penguins and sea otters and several types of sea birds. The exhibit tanks on the lower level show you all sorts of exotic ocean species.

I do worry a little over whether having the number of fish that they have is OK, however, from a viewing perspective, it is spectacular. I felt the admission price was good value for money. If you visit do ensure that you have a camera that can take decent pictures without flash assistance. Visiting in September, the area around the Aquarium looked relatively dead. It looked like there was not much else to do, however, this is an attraction that is worth at least a couple of hours spent going around."

The huge aquarium with plenty of different kind of fish is beautiful to watch. You can just sit there and watch for more than an hour. I would definitely recommend to visit this attraction. Try to combine it with the whole Parque das Nacoes and shopping center. There is enough to see, sit down, relax, eat, drink, etc. By taxi it will cost you 10,00/12,50 euro. Departing from the city center."

Other areas contained tropical fish, penguins, sea otters and more. Bit expensive for a family of four at 54 Euros including the temporary exhibition though. Out of the centre of Lisbon, on the bright, open waterfront at Oriente [red line Metro] that's worth a visit on its own. Plenty of food and drink outlets and a big modern shopping mall."

Everything kills your vacation filling even before you get to oceanario.A lot of free space around the complex, so much space with empty interlocking squares I never saw in my life, everything just like 50 years back as somebody forgot about this part of the city.Inside the oceanario you will find nice small pools in a 2 levels, in a hour and half you will be ready to leave the space even if you will read every sign.Not recommended! Find more positive views in downtown, maybe some shows, maybe some theatre, maybe museum but don't kill you half od the day for this very far, not so big ceanario.

From there, you can go on a nice, but slightly long walk to the Vasco da Gama Tower and Bridge, along the Tagus/Tejo River. Then you can go inside the Vasco da Gama Shopping Centre, which is also really close to the train and metro station."

Near da Expo \u2013 Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es you can pick the underground and visit this well conceived and wonderful place \u2013 dedicated for all that like the sea and its species. A very big variety in a very big tank all in glass you can nearly touch the water and species like e.g. a shark. After the visit you have restaurants and others attractions nearby"

It's situated in a lovely spot right on the water and is easy to get to on the metro, though a bit of a journey depending on where you are staying. I imagine if I had kids this would probably be way higher on my list of things to see. Families with children running around everywhere were definitely the key visitors. It was a little much for me, personally. Maybe I missed it, but other than a running special exhibit, I didn't see any cool shows or talks offered, which is something I usually look forward to at aquariums. Sure, I probably wouldn't have understood most of the narration, but I'll take a good dolphin or beluga whale show anytime.Overall, a neat spot if you're interested in marine life, but not the above-average aquarium it's hyped up to be. Unless you have kids, I wouldn't put it high on the list."

This was a fantastic day out and really strongly recommended!Your hotel may have a 15% discount voucher to give you but otherwise a family ticket is between 34 - 42 Euros. We paid the higher fee and went to the additional temporary turtle exhibition - but you get the impression that it is permanent and the 'theme' changes regularly.The main aquarium is on two floors, built around a huge central tank. You enter on the top floor, are directed to follow large arrows to take your in an out of additional 'outdoor' exhibits.The central tank is huge and was filled with thousands of fish, too numerous to mention, but included vaious types of sharks and rays.The outdoor exhibits had sea birds, penguin puffins, sea otters as well as a tropical area. The lower floor had many other, smaller 'themed' tanks as well as educational and kids areas.The gift shop was good quality and the coffee shop was perfect to have a sit (rest) in afterwards with seats mainly outside looking at views of the bay and Vasco de Gama bridge.A truly great day - pre-trip i was a little reluctant thinking i would be wasting time going, but it turned out to be one of the trip highlights. don't miss it!"

It is small, expensive and extremely crowded when compared to the ones in the USA. Besides, this aquarium has really long queues and is full of nagging and whimpering kids. I could not enjoy it much. The gift shop at the exit was the only thing I really liked. Not recommended especially for people without kids."

Depending on what you want to see, you can buy the proper ticket and enter the museum. Dark hallway surrounded by huge aquariums allows you to witness the most interesting and different types of sea life. Fish, frogs, Penguins,...You can also find information boards or LCDs and read information or even listen to the sound of the ocean. A very interesting part is where you will see only sand, but if you pay closer attention you'll find the live creatures moving under the sand.Apart from the museum itself, I personally enjoyed the exterior part a lot. There is a big area in front of the main entrance with palm trees, dancing fountains, restaurants and playing facilities for children and also souvenir shops.If you are in Lisbon, do not lose the chance to experience the ocean :)"

When we got inside and saw how much walking was involved (her ankles were BAD), I asked another staff member if he could make an exception.

Also the variety of exhibits is huge.This place is great for families with children as well as adults. The adult price was EUR 16.Perhaps the only negative thing was a group of people taking photos with flash when we were told in 5 different languages not to use flash.

It is about 20 minutes from central Lisbon on the metro near the Oriente station on the red line that goes to the airport. From the metro you need to go through the shopping centre to get to the river front and then turn right and walk about 10 minutes. The entry fee is Euro16, (kids e11) there is a small reduction for students if you ask for it. There is an audioguide available (e2.50) which was OK.The cost includes the temporary exhibit, which is the sea turtles. I thought this was worth the extra few euro because you can actually sit below their tank or stand on top on a glass floor while they swim under your feetThe main exhibit is a massive central tank, with different zones at each corner of the building representing different areas of the world. These contain penguins and puffins and best of all, the sea otters, who were real entertainers.The main tank can be viewed from 2 floors, we sat on the floor at the bottom, and watched for ages, it was kind of hypnotic and soporific. There are lots of small tanks and displays and an activity area. In one of these tanks there were sea dragons which I never knew existed, and were brilliant, so fragile! We also found Nemo, look carefully for him.At the end was a video that was very good, showing how the aquarium is maintained and how each of the types of fish is fed its own individual diet. It is hard work maintaining something so big.It is well worth going out of the way to see this. The area around is attractive and modern and there is a nice walk along the river front or a cable car. There are lots of fast food family eating places in the big shopping centre nearby and some good shopping too."

I am sure we could have and would have spent longer if our daughter was a bit older, but we loved the time we did spend there. The layout of the Oceanario is well-designed, and it was easy to maneuver even with our large running stroller. A great benefit to the Oceanario is its location. It is located in a large, ocean-side park so there are lots of places for little people to run around and stretch their legs, and enjoy an ice cream cone.

It was great! It's one of the largest oceanariums in Europe, no doubt (only the aquarium in Palma , Majorca can contest) and we spent easily 4 hours there . It's cleverly designed with a giant tank in the middle, surrounded by habitats and animals in different oceans, i.e. the Atlantic, the Pacific....etc, and so you would always encounter something you missed in the previous sector, as all these sea creatures swim about. We saw the rare sun fish, along with big sharks, rays, barracudas, and so on. If you sit on the floor and look up the glass tank, you could imagine yourself at the bottom of the sea, it's like diving without getting yourself wet! We also visited the temp exhibition on turtles, which was educational. We completed this wonderful experience by having a buffet lunch with all-you-can-eat meat cut at table, at only less than 9 euro per head (half price for kids) at the Chimarrao restaurant (the Brazilian style) just outside the Oceanarium. Note: you can also order set lunch/ dish of the day for 5 euro, if you are not a big eater."

If you've never been to an aquarium before try this one, mucho better than the feeble one Boris offers in London ! If you want lunch don't go to the aquarium restaurants , try the food court at the near by shipping centre, (not between 1 and 2)."

Instead of small to medium sized tanks cramped with one species at a time, the visitor experiences what it might feel like walking the ocean floor, huge glass fronts and quite lovely outside areas of rocks and the like, home to everything from sharks to penguins and otters. A great place and a fantastic day out. The temporary exhibiton was dissapointing, but then again, the place itself is alright."

Monday afternoon early July, in the middle of the heatwave, we ventured all the way by Metro to Orient station to visit the oceanarium with three teen agers. The center aquarium is definitely worth a view. Do not wait in line to get the first view, there are plenty of opportunities to see it from different angles througout the oceanarium. We were lucky to see two divers in the aquarium with sharks and stingrays cleaning the window from the inside :) Also other sea animals are on display, and we spent around 1 1/2 hours cooled and entertained. The cafeteria serves a very decent lunch menu. It is best to sit outside in the patio, it gets very noisy inside."

I believe this is Europe's second biggest aquarium after Istanbul's Turkuazoo, but the main tank at Lisbon is actually more impressive because it is more central in the building, and so can contain larger species, including sand tiger sharks and a devilfish (a *slightly* smaller relative of the manta ray). You can stare at the main tank alone for at least half an hour. Scattered around it are smaller exhibits of species from all over the world, including octopus and cuttlefish, seahorses and sea dragons, clownfish and lionfish, penguins and some adorable sea otters. While we were there, there was a temporary exhibit of turtles, which was well worth the extra admission fee (you can choose just to do the main exhibit if you're short of time/cash). They're huge!"

The otters and penguins kept in an outdoor atmosphere were a treat to the eyes, especially the otters.The otters were a delight to watch - the twinkling eyes, the little nose,the silken fur and the way they were lying on their backs in water.Ofcourse all the species living in the seas were interesting to watch - watchful Eels hiding inside the sea rocks,jelly fishes glowing in the dark,octopus swaying gently,colourful sea animones looking like Dalia flowers,elegantly moving colourful fishes, scurrying schools of fish,violent sharks-every bit proved to be an wonderful experience.I think we should have taken more than two hours to watch the sealife here.

If you are not a diving person, this Oceanario is definitely the place where you can explore, watch, even learn about the most interesting inhabitants of the ocean.  The whole walk takes 1-2 hours; There is a floor dedicated to turtles, their history, their endangered existence on our planet, and how people exploit them, or save and protect them.  Nice cafeteria - cooked meals.Staff - nice! When we were heading towards the lower floor, he stopped us and asked if we walked on the glass? Then came with us, and showed us, a place , where we did not expect that the exhibit continues; He was right, and attentive, if it was not for him, and his dedication to the job, we would have skipped , the half turtles aquarium.  You can take pictures inside, just without flash. Bus stop is just outside the oceanario. Regular busses, Sightseeing buses, Yellow Busses.Also on 5 mins walk there is a pharmacy, open on Sundays even (just if you forgot your suncream)  As a conclusion, you can enjoy, educate yourselves and get fascinated by how amazing is our Planet in terms of inhabitants, especially the ocean."

It is a good place to visit with family and kids, even us (couples in late 20s) enjoyed this journey to see all these sea creatures. However, walking here (from Orient Station) is quite a long walk under a hot sunny day. There seem to be lacking of things to do in the surrounding area. We saw some cable car going to another place, but we had no idea what it is and we had to go to our next spot so couldn't really check it out .I saw some people that mentioned there are a lot of restaurants, but we don't see any other than the ones in the Oceanario, food was okay for a quick sandwich or lunch but nothing fancy. If there's more tourist things to do, it would be perfect!And on the day we went there, there was the metro strike, despite the fact that there isn't any metro to take, we had to do 45 mins of the bus and when the bus arrived, it wouldn't stop for us because it's full of people. Another thing about the location and inconvenience of this place :("

The creators of the Oceanarium have tried to recreate the experience of a giant ocean area populated by a diverse range of fish, and they have more or less succeeded. Ocean Sun fish rub shoulders with Manta Rays and various sharks, while tuna-type things and angel fish mingle with more bizarre animals such as the guitar fish. To the side there are tropical fish tanks and coral reefs, as well as outdoor sections with otters, penguins and guillemots. There is also a temporary exhibit, which at this moment is a fairly interactive turtle tank. The turtles and other fish swim through a lob winding corridor, while you walk on top, underneath and alongside. The whole thing kind of takes your breath away with its sheer scale. The fish and other creatures look happy enough, and there is a sense that everything there is in the best interests of the animals, rather than the public, which is nice from an Eco-conservationist point of view. Not particularly cheap, but definitely worth a visit."

What a treat we were in for!At the time of our visit, there was a temporary sea turtle exhibition, which was really nice: there's something magical about those slow-moving creatures slowly passing by past the viewing windows. If you're here anytime soon, make sure to visit that exhibition as well!The regular exhibition was outstanding as well: bilingual (English and Portuguese), a dash of conservation message, a brilliantly large fish tank and some pretty happy penguins and sea otters (incredibly cool!). Great 'mood' in the place as well: it's mostly darkened, so the fish and other animals really stand out. It's very popular with locals as well, who bring their kids - and amazingly all those kids seemed to go into a Zen-like state when going inside.So, if you have an afternoon to spend in Lisbon, don't hesitate to go. Metro connections are easy and fast from the center."

This is easily the best aquarium I have ever visited. The central tank is epic, with such a variety of fish, including fish I had never seen before (and I have been to a good few aquariums). The sea otters are adorable and fascinating and look like they love living there which you don't often see at animal attractions. I could have watched them forever. The penguin enclosure is amazing, huge blocks of ice and a very authentic environment for them to live in. You can get so close too! Throught the attraction there are tanks and tanks of fascinating aquatic creatures, I loved the sea dragons and the different types of jelly fish. The information provided is informative without being too much. The groups of children we saw there looked like they were having a great time. When we went there was a temporary sea turtle exhibition which was just fantastic. They have rescued 4 sea turtles and created them a temporary environment for them to live in to get used to being in a mixed sea again. The sea turtles swim under and over your ahead and I was lucky enough to come face to face with the biggest one. It was my favourite part of the attraction which means it must be good as I loved it all. The entry fee of 16 euros (3euros extra for sea turtles - basic entry is 13 euros) is great value for money, especially compared to the one in London. The gift shop was great too, actually had things you wanted to buy instead of a load of tat. My litlle brother loved his gift from there. We visited on the way back to the airport and they had lockers for our bags which was great as we didnt have to carry them round the exhibit. A must do when visiting Lisbon. Don't miss out!"

This is certainly not the largest aquarium, but it's a fantastic aquarium for its size and includes many beautiful fish, as well as sea otters, penguins, enormous rays and sharks. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this aquarium back in 2000 and brought my boyfriend with me to visit it this year and still loved it as much as I did 13 years ago. I've been to the Atlanta aquarium and favor this one to my experience at that one... Lots of places to sit as you're walking around so you can just watch fish. Definitely recommend making the trip there if you like marine life!"

I was amazed at the size of the main tank and the enormous variety of species they had. There were so many highlights really but what stood out for me were the turtles, the sharks and the Antarctic habitat. I have a bit of an obsession with sea horses and I was absolutely mesmerised by the sea dragons on show. I could have stared at them for half the day had my husband allowed! Whether you bring kids along or not this is an amazing way to discover the variety in all oceans, without even getting wet! Best attraction we saw in Lisbon. An afternoon well spent."

The Temporary exhibit was boring for the kids. The interiors of the aquarium are too dark except for the penguins and otters. Not a single dolphin or whale here - they have a show at the ZOO. One huge aquarium tank seen from all angles. It was very crowded everywhere and even in the cafeteria - not a place to sit. People were smoking right at the door of the aquarium which made it very difficult for us to breathe right inside. Quite a walk from the station which made it in difficult in the rain and no place to get a taxi almost all the way to the station.

The main two storey tank is spectacular, we were captivated by the ocean sunfish and manta ray, very unusual to see in an aquarium. The airy 'greenhouses' on the upper level were also amazing. Who can resist sea otters? Plus free-flying Inca Tern dive-bombing unsuspecting bystanders. The temporary leatherback turtle exhibition was also brilliant, with these lovely creatures swimming around in glass tunnels beneath your feet.A few areas could be improved. For example, information on the creatures in the main tank is limited to the 'star' attractions, it would have been nice to know more about the supporting cast. But overall, the concept and design works well, as evidenced by its high ratings. Lots of space to move around, though still best enjoyed when not too busy. The entry fee is fair - we have paid the same at places which offer far less. Of course, if you don't appreciate the natural world, then spend your money elsewhere. But this could just be the place to change your mind.We also ate in the Oceanario's self-service cafeteria Tejo, which had nice traditional Portuguese dishes (Arroz de Pato and Bacalhau Dourado), plus toasted sandwiches at reasonable prices.In summary, muito bem!"

It was expensive to visit both the permanent and temporary exhibits(42 euro for a family) but we did spend almost 3 hours inside(would probably have been there longer if just adults) so ok in the end. We had only previously visited a very small aquarium (very small!) so this was fantastic. It seemed to be possible to see the big tank(which I believe is actually 3 tanks seemlessly joined?) from all angles and at the temporary exhibition it was possible to stand on a glass floor and watch turtles and fish swim beneath your feet. Apart from the big tank there are also numerous small tanks with various sea-creatures as well as sea-birds, penguins etc. As I said in my title the only thing that ruined the visit was the adults whtat were there without children. At each view of a tank(though the crowds faded as you passed thru the facility) there was a crush to get right up to the glass window to the tank. Any families were taking it in turns to let kids in to see but adults(mainly over 50) that were without kids were rude in the first instance and actually a little reckless also. My 6 year old had to wait (impatiently) at each tank to get in so that she could see(unless a family was moving out and let her in to replace one of their kids) but then she risked being trampled on by another adult pushing in to see. I realise that this is not the fault of the Oceanarium and happens at lots of other attractions also but by posting hopefully people might rethink their next visit(though these people were not local) and think of the smaller visitors who just want to see!"

Visited on a very wet public holiday so we accepted that it would be very busy, but they should know this too so I can't understand why they would only have 2 counters selling tickets and 2 machines. The queues went right along the outside of the building, past the outside food area with no staff around to ask any questions if needed, this is something they should really try to improve on. But on the plus side, they did offer free entry for having a disability (think there was also free tickets for families with children under 5) but this isn't stated anywhere on their website or the board near the queue for tickets. You do obviously need something to prove your disability, I have found often in Europe they also ask for the % of your disability, for some reason having your disease etc is only worth a free ticket if you have it more than 80%. The aquarium, lots to see, easy to spend all day there if you have children. We were there for around 3 hours and saw quite a bit. They do have a varied amount of species to see such as the big tank with different sharks, sting rays and a big variety of other fish, otters, penguins, jellyfish, sea dragons, star fish.. the list could be very long! Tickets are \u20ac13 for the permanent exhibits for adults & there is an option to pay extra for the temporary exhibit. There are toilets dotted throughout the building with some areas to sit down or have something to eat. Glad we went, but don't think it is something I would feel the need to return to on another visit unless I had children.

I was little bit hesitant to bring my family to this place at first may be because of the fee or may be because I've seen a lot of Aquariums big and small in the US and in Asia. Yet s'all worth it, that gimmick in that turtle section where you walk on a \"riverlike thingy\" is funtastic - mind/brain being fooled (to walk/step on it or to jump - turtles and fish swimming underneath you). A place to see/watch one giant Sunfish and several matured Sea Dragons - a WOW!!! Another special mention: those giant Otters, my mother feel in love with them, they seemed trained to captivate a guest as they skilfully sample their food/fish lovingly tossed to 'em by their trainer. I can go on and on... ...Oh! this place is close to a lot of interesting places too: the science museum, Vasco de Gama Mall/Tower, etc."

This is a stunning area to visit and is in stark contrast to the older architecture of Lisbon City. The area was created for the Expo 1998 and its modern architecture tone was set by the impressive Oriente station. The gravity defying Portugal Pavilion has an enormous reinforced concrete roof suspended above its forecourt and makes you a tad nervous to walk beneath it. The cable cars that connect the Torre Vasco da Gama invite you to see the wonderful sights seen from their dizzying heights - I chose to admire them from below! We had lunch in Urizon restaurant along the seafront and we weren't too impressed. They left us waiting for ages for our food and only that we were enjoying the sun we would have complained. Beware when they bring you bread, olives, dips and cheese. These are not free! the plate of 4 slices of cheese was \u20ac4 and each pat of butter or tuna spread was 65c... I belive they left us waiting so long so we'd cave and eat them but I had been warned by a tripadvisor review to beware of this tactic...they did however get another beer from us.We then took a stroll down the walkway under the cable cars to the Aquarium....The aquarium is amazing! loads of unusual fish in a large central tank over two floors. They also had birds, frogs and the cutest otters ever! The turtle exhibition was good aswell although very busy, there seemed to be hundreds of teenage groups around but it is a great place for children of all ages - even adult children!Theres also a huge shopping centre, cinema, science museum, exhibition centre and a view to the longest bridge(17km) in Europe which is of course called the Vasco da Gama bridge as is the shopping centre and the tallest building in Lisbon the Torre Vasco da Gama. This area is easily reached by the red metro line that feeds the airport, it took about 20 mins to get there from Lisbon centre, we had to change line once but its very easy to navigate the metro stations.Really worth a days visit even more so if you have children and they've had enough of ancient churches etc."

It's lovely, takes about 2 hrs to get round and it means you get to see the unique and unusual Mola Mola (sunfish). The main tank is huge and has loads of good stuff including lots of pelagics and rays. In addition to the main fish tanks, there is loads of other stuff to see. penguins, turtles, reptiles, jelly fish, and of course, as others have said, you just can't beat the sea otters. Very cool.I highly recommend it and if you buy the open top bus tour ticket you can get there and back on one of their buses."

A short walk from the Oriente Metro station takes you to the front entrance. I was there in the afternoon, along with dozens of school children, but I was able to get my ticket immediately and enter the building. A temporary exhibit of the rescue of the Kemp's Ridley sea turtles was very good - the design of the structure allows the visitor to watch all the creatures up close. The permanent exhibit is organized around the concept of the World Ocean, with a large central tank shared by hundreds of aquatic creatures, including sharks, rays, and schools of fish. The highlight for me, however, was the penguin exhibit, arguably the best I have ever seen. The visitor can get close enough to this open air area to almost touch the animals, and they are in large enough numbers to give one a great idea of the complexity of their lives. I watched one male build a nest, straw by straw (these are rockhoppers, btw), but I could also easily see others nesting, swimming, waddling around, etc. Be prepared to walk - the exhibit hall is large and can easily take a few hours. Good gift shop, too!"

The design of how the oceans meet is pretty unique and seeing the open air enclosures on one level and then seeing it underwater is also cool.A couple of small negatives - there are no opportunities to interact really (a plus for Sentosa's aquarium) and the turtle exhibition wasn't as good as I'd hoped.

I can recommend the audio-guide if you have a special interest, but most of the time we were too busy looking around and exploring to bother tapping in the numbers on the device.The Oceanario is part of the World Expo-site from '98, and I would definitely encourage exploring the surrounding area. The site still attracts visitors with its beautiful layout and stylish streamlined green spots. The hangglider is fun to try as well. You will enjoy an amazing view and also see the huge compound that hosted the international pavilions during the Expo, all of which now look somewhat abandoned. Upon seeing this, close your eyes and try to imagine the atmosphere and noise of 10 million people(!) that visited the Expo over it's only 3 months duration.Overall, a very nice afternoon visiting the Oceanario and surrounding area!"

As others have said it is something very different to do, a change of scene from churches, museums, and monuments. There is a lot to see even if most of the 'viewing' is of the central tank from different angles. We were there on a Monday afternoon and it was not crowded, affording us wonderful, up close & personal views. The area (Parque das Nacoes) is very nice to walk around as well. The only negative thing I can say is to avoid the cafe! There must be better places to eat in the area."

The signs were very informative, in English and in Portugese, and I like how they stressed proper care for the oceans and gave tips on how we can help the oceans. Near the end of our time there, there is a theater area where they show a video on how they feed and care for the fish, and it was fascinating. I saw fishes I had never seen before, like the ocean sunfish. The otters and penguins were so much fun to watch. The main tank was amazing, but make sure you see all the smaller tanks too! Some of the areas were very dark, which I didn't like too much, but that's my only complaint."

My wife likes to scuba dive, and I don't, but here you can get a good impression of what it is like to be in (crowded) see: a wide range of fish, floating right by you, as you stand up against the glass wall cruved around in the three story aquarium. And all this not being cold and wet, and not being afraid of the human size shark bearing down on you. They also provide a 15 minute documentary with english subtitles explaining how the aquariam works, how they feed the fish (so the sharks and other large fish aren't always eating the small ones). it is a relaxing place to sit after a four hour walking tour of Lisbon.I like how the center is split into different climate zones: antartica with its penguin family, and otter pond, a warm Indian ocean, and so on. An unique experience (which really has nothing to do with Lisbon, though it does show the quality of Portuguese scientists)."

You may rent an audio guide in deiiferent languages, which will guide you and give informations about the different views you pass by in the Oceanarium. Just press the number on the wall at your audio.If you visit at luch time, they have a nice cafe with a daily lunch offer, and you may sit inside and outside.

You could spend all day in there quite easily. There are 2 types of tickets a combined ticket which includes the main permanent exhibition and smaller temporary exhibition for 16 euros per adult or a visit to the permanent exhibition only which is slightly cheaper at 13 euros. We decided to get the combined ticket as it mean we could see the sea turtles in the temporary exhibition up close. David Attenborough eat your heart out!We spent a good half day in there and had our lunch in the restaurant which was very nice and reasonable. The admission is a little pricey at 16 euros and we were initially sceptical however it was well worth it as it is very impressive. There are signs in English so you can read about the different species.All in all would recommend for a visit."

A simple concept of 'all of the oceans are one ocean' means that there is one vast central tank adjoined by four others, each of which represents a different ocean. You can walk through first at a height, and then recirculate to see what's going on beneath the surface - esp good for the penguins at feeding time! Plus you get the weird view through the tanks so just behind the penguins you can see the sharks and rays in the central tank! The current temporary exhibition is of turtles - which, again, is brilliantly done so that you can experience them swimming beneath your feet - and then over your head. Kids loved this zone! There's some very good educational messages about recycling and not dumping plastic bags too. At 16 euros each it's not the cheapest attraction but it is one you could easily spend many hours enjoying."

It's a bit more expensive, costing 16 euros each (I believe about 10 for the aquarium and 6 for the turtle exhibit, but I could be mistaking). The temporary exhibit was not that special, allthough they had the biggest turtle I've ever seen in my life - the sheer size of the thing was mind blowing.The main aquarium was very pleasant and impressive to watch. They had several species I hadn't seen in other aquariums (such as the ocean sun fish, for example) and some nice habitats with, amongst others, pinguins and sea otters. The habitats looked very high quality.If you like marine life or animals in general, the Oceanario is definitely worth it. It's defnitely more impressive than any other aquarium I've seen - though I would personally recommend to skip the temporary turtle exhibit they've got on at the moment (January 2013) if you're not specifically interested in turtles."

In short - don't miss.Oh, it says that there is a discount on the web, worth trying."

However, it was definitely one of the highlights for my nine year old and we were all captivated, especially by the otters - we were lucky enough to catch them being fed which is unforgettably cute. The penguin feeding is also a great spectacle, but we're lucky enough to have witnessed this before, so it didn't touch us quite so much. There were loads of other fascinating creatures in the outlying tanks and it was very relaxing just sitting down in front of the main tank and watching the many species from different angles.

The lines to get tickets were very long and we were cut off several times by rude people. This continued the whole time in the Oceanarium. There was a sea turtle exhibit when we went. The exhibit would have been great but people and kids just camped out on top of the glass viewing area or in front of it. Everytime a turtle came around, a mass of people would rush up. It was difficult to see the turtles.The absolute highlight were the giant sea otters. They were exciting and the area to view them was large enough that a bunch of people could line around the fence and all see them. All in all, it was a good time killer for two exhausted tourists. I would imagine this would be a must for people with children. I typically love Oceanariums, but this was a bit of a let down."

The arctic aquarium has pinguins and sealions, for instance, so 'small'is very relative. There are also two floors, from the upper floor you can look down on the water surface and see birds and mammals and from the bottom you can see inside the ocean. There are also numerous individual small aquariums attributed to special fishes, like seahorses and catfish. It is an absolute shame to miss this when you are in Lisbon!"

Recently i'm not sure, but few years back, despite the long queues, you can get in fairly quickly. Besides you don't want it to be too crowded in there.Nearby you can find coffee shop and an ice cream shop, always very crowded in the summer but very good, lots of space for kids to run, a bike rental place and a \"cable car\" (not sure that is how you say it in English) Very pleasurable area to visit.

We went to this attraction after seeing it rated so highly on Trip Advisor and seeing the photo I thought it was connected to the sea as it sits right in the water. Sadly I was wrong. The centre tank was simply overcrowded with fish of every sort. Many of these creatures are solitary and unaccustomed to being with so many others. The stress of being at such close quarters with your natural predators must surely cause unnatural behaviours as must being fed. The sight of sea otters being fed lumps of fish was strange as there was a circus aspect to this behaviour - the otters basked and rolled with or for the food. Similarly the penguins were fed dead fish and bits of dead fish littered the tanks. Made me reflect on the sanitised view of sea life we were being fed.... I've become cynical about how we use animals for our entertainment but if this is so high on the list of best things to do in Lisbon what does it say about the rest of the city?"

The oceanarium is layed out around a huge, multi-story central tank, with smaller exhibits--otters, jellyfish, penguins and so on--on the side. You start at the top and work your way down a series of ramps. The oceanarium appears to have been part of a World's Fair renewal project in the 1990s. The closest Metro stop, Oriente, was designed by Santiago Calatrava, the well-regarded Spanish architect, and it's worth a look."

There's a couple of really interesting fish inside, with names I can't remember, so I'll call them \"sideways flat fish\" and \"weird yellow fish with chunky teeth\". If you go you'll know them when you see them.They also have exhibits with penguins, otters and even a small tropical rainforest. There's a decent amount of variety, and enough to keep adults (as well as kids) occupied for an hour or two.The best part isn't even in the aquarium - it's the open waterfall outside the main entrance where you buy tickets.

However, it's very informative, and we could not believe the number and variety of fish and other sea-based life that seem to be peacefully coexisting in the central main tank (which is huge). There's a video to watch about how they feed and maintain the aquarium that explains a lot about that.Anyway, we enjoyed it immensely. The one thing my husband got a little freaked about was the glass floor over a portion of the aquarium where you feel like you're walking on the water. If you can go to Portugal and especially if you're on a tour and \"churched out,\" try this experience as a great change of subject and pace."

The sound system is great. The amount and variety of fishes and other sea-lifes are rich and wonderful. The information is useful and just enough. There I took the audio guide but unless you have great interest in knowing a lot about the Oceanario and plan to spend more than 3 hours there, you wouldn't miss much things by not getting one. Furthermore, inside the Oceanario, it's pretty dark so with the audio guide, you need a bit of attention to look for the guide number on the wall. Therefore, in my opinion, just focus on looking at the fish and spend time sitting beside the tank is the best way to experiencing the place and having a great time."

The only bad thing about it is the huge amount of visitors. Too crowded during summer.The temporary exhibition about the turtles isn't worth your money.

There is a lovely area with beavers floating hand in hand on the top and fish below, but watch out for the sea birds flying above, they have a tendency to aim there poop at you!"

The main tank is very impressive for its huge size and you can see views of it from many different levels. I was impressed by all the sea life swimming together, and I do not understand how the bigger fish, like the sharks, do not eat the smaller fish! They show how each ocean of the world looks like. In a smaller exhibit, you see penguins, which are quite enjoyable to see. It is a bit dark, but one just follows the arrows to see everything. The explanations are very educational and seeing this huge aquarium is very enjoyable for all ages."

We traveled there by metro ....there could be some better directions from the Metro station to the place but that isn't the oceanario's fault. We bought the ticket which included the turtles and it was definitely worth the 3 extra euros. They were all rescue creatures and so beautiful. The part where they swim under your feet was fantastic. The central (2 floor) aquarium reminded me a little of the London aquarium (another fantastic example). Lots of other animals to see too, such as the puffins, sea otters and frogs/toads. Fantastic way to spend 2-3 hours :)"

It is entertaining whilst still being educational and environmentally aware.The main area is divided into a main display tank plus four smaller tanks representing four major ocean ecosystems. These are divided into a surface and an underwater level.There is also a temporary exhibit area as well which can be visited at an extra cost. Whilst we were there it was an exhibition about sea turtles and contained four turtles that had been rescued.The whole thing is done very well, with the feeling that the animals on display are not there just to amuse us but are well looked after in naturalistic environments."

This gives the opportunity of seeing fish schooling and a great variety of sea life all together. They also have designed it with concave walls that are well cleaned so your photos come out well. In addition they have some above water levels, with penguins, puffins, sea otters etc. We saw the otters being fed and it was simply wonderful. Our only criticism is that in comparison the temporary exhibit about sea turtles was disappointing. Quite small and not enough actual turtles!"

Take the red line to Oriente and when you leave the station cross over the busy main road, through the Vasco Da Gama shopping centre towards the water's edge and turn right. It's a huge, impressive building and its main feature is an enormous tank where you can view sharks, rays and other fascinating fish at different levels as you walk around. There are re-creations of the world's ocean ecosystems including the Antartic tank where you can view the characterful penguins and duck the low flying birds circling overhead! The Pacific tank is also a must just watch the adorable otters floating on their backs looking too cute for words. It was 16\u20ac for one adult and that included entry to the temporary display of sea turtles. There's lots of information and it's also in English too. I got there late morning and it was terribly busy which did spoil some of the enjoyment for me. But the answer is get there early to avoid the coach parties and school trips. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants to choose from nearby although the onsite cafe was very good too. There is also a good shop if you want to buy a last minute cuddly shark to take home!"

The fish and sharks in the main tank were incredible as were the smaller displays of fish and amphibians around the oceanario (glow-in-the-dark jelly fish!!). The information signs were very interesting and helpful as well, I remember wondering about specific aspects of the animals only to have my questions answered by reading the signs.What sets this aquarium apart from the others that I have seen are the Sea Otters! They are the cutest most fascinating animals and I just wanted to jump in the water and hug one! I could have watched them for hours.We went through the whole aquarium in about 2 hours and found that that was the perfect length of time.TIP: the main aquarium is in the center of the oceanario and can be viewed from ALL AROUND. So don't waste your time in the big crowd surrounding the windows at the very beginning. Keep walking and you can get a less crowded view.TIP: buy tickets online before you go to avoid the big lineup!!! We went at 3 and there was a large lineup to buy tickets but because we already had ours, we walked right in."

There is an extensive array of fish, sharks and other ocean life and the open air tanks for otters, seals and penguins are beautiful. We visited on a weekend and the queue seemed never ending, so i would definitely recommend going on a weekday.The oceanarium is a full days outing for couples or families. when you are finished in the exhibition there are amazing outdoor spaces to explore, and lovely green areas for a picnic."

There is a que for electronic tickets - jump in this one - so so so much faster and a staff member waiting to help you use the machine. A little expensive but truely brilliant."

It is expensive, but it's worth the price you pay. You think of going because of the kids but then you realise you are there for your own fun. This area of Lisbon is wonderful, the building itself and its immediate surroundings are all the stuff of movies, and then you go in and it's even better. The concept of the visit is smart and very well aligned with the internal architecture. Besides the central tank, which is maybe the single most amazing thing I've ever seen, the several tanks on the corners, representing the world's oceans, give you a feeling of going on a journey over the Earth in just a few hours. Underwater."

Portugal was so wise when it designed the Expo site (which is where you will find this attraction) for its future use, and as a result Lisbon has a modern, popular and very well laid out riverside area. You will be able to see into the water at several levels, and observe some amazing ocean life of all sizes and colours. If you are taking the kids, they will love it; in fact you will probably have a problem to get them to leave."

I heard rumors that it is the biggest in Europe and the second biggest in the world, but I'm not sure if that's true.  Anyway, I love aquariums, and as they go, this one was very good. They have a temporary exhibition room, and at the moment it's devoted to sea turtles. You do pay a bit extra for this room, but it's worth it, because the tank is basically a huge ring around the room, and you walk in the middle of it. At the entrance and exit you can walk over it and see the creatures swimming underneath you, and there is also a sofa for six people that goes under it! As well as this, there is a huge wall of information about the different types of sea turtles, and some of the hazards presented to them in the wild. It also has interactive games for children.  Also, you don't feel bad about paying to see captive turtles because they are all rescue turtles, due to be released back into the wild after the exhibition. Even if you decide not to see the temporary exhibition, the permanent one is just as good. There is one huge tank containing loads of different species of fish, including sharks, and around this there are rooms with birds such as puffins and penguins, and more sea life including sea otters. There is detailed information about all the species, and a film about how the animals are cared for.  This aquarium is fun for everyone, young children to older people, and also has a cafe. I recommend it to everyone who goes to Lisbon for more than a day!"

There is an artificial rock built around this fishbowl, with many \"windows\" where you can look inside. The path takes you 360 degrees around the perimeter of the fishbowl. That's basically all there is to it. There are a couple of rooms off to the side, nothing special, a few penguins in one, lizards & snakes in the other. But really was disappointing to all of us. I have seen better aquariums in Florida. Mind you, it is spotlessly clean and there are a lot of fish to see. So for younger children, it would be amazing and I would recommend it. My daughters, 14 & 16 were interested, but not overly excited. As I said, we've seen better. Found it overpriced for what it was -- and they charge an additional fee if you want to see the \"temporary\" exhibit which happened to be turtles, which I thought was a rip off.

Very cleverly done with the central tank fall of sharks, sting rays, etc. You can also see penguins, puffins, otters and other seabirds in the acquarium. You can also view the fish that lives in the dark and has a light coming from the end of his head never seen before in any other acquarium. I would deffinately visit again if I ever go back to Lisbon."

It was nice to see some outside displays as well as 'just' fish tanks and the size of the central tank was massive and very impressive. We have seen a few similar displays in our time but this was well worth a visit.Also good for a stroll along the water or perhaps a ride in the cable car which gives you very impressive views of the Vasco da Gama bridge."

The oceanarium has sections, each dedicated to different oceans. Many similar places I've been to usually stink from the smell of fish, this one has some open areas and the smell is considerably less than in the oceanariums I've seen in Israel and United Kingdom. It will take you maximum 2 hours to see the whole place. The price was somewhere between \u20ac10-15.

Most of the fishes in the main tank are gray, so it's not as beautiful as some other aquariums.The sea otters are cute and steal attention from the fishes, but I wouldn't go to the oceanario only to see them.We walked through the permanent exhibit in about an hour, which makes me think that the size of the exhibit is just proper.The oceanario is a bit far away from the city, but a visit there gives a good opportunity to visit other parts of the Parque das Na\u00e7\u00f5es at the same time. If you want to do shopping, you can do that in the Vasco da Gama shopping center, through which you have to walk from the metro station. Lisbon doesn't have that many top attractions, so if you're spending more than a few days in the city, I would recommend visiting this one as well."

From all angles, yes even from above (a glass plate you can walk over) and from below (you sit under a glass wall where the turtles pass) you can experience the beauty of these animals.Also the main (permanent) exhibit was terrific. In the center there is one big area of open sea where they exhibit sharks, manta rays and even a Lunar fish. Around the centre tank, there are 8 seperate areas which show all different corners of the earth and its characteristic animals.Great set-up, very educative and good value for the money."

Also the proper part of the building housed a lot of sea creatures and had a huge aquarium in the middle which you could see from every part of the building. our favourite part was the otters, who seemed to be busy trying to open a tupperware box with food in it.

Quit impressive ! During the visit you walk arround this giant aquarium and after a wile we felt that it looked a Little bit the same from each different corner.When strolling by the other smaller aquariums we found that the lighting in these displays in many cases was too poor to enjoy them completely. Regarding that one of my favorite photo objects are aquariums I can say that the poor light was a disaster to take sharp pictures, even after adjusting my camera with all the different programmes that I could use.Still, we were impressed by the giant aquarium but have to say that there are better ones...eg London aquarium, Artis zoo Amsterdam, Aquatopia in Antwerp !"

These not only add value to the Oceanario,but also make you feel like you're in the middle of a Nat Geo program.If you add the special sleep over programs for kids (search online for this) you have a great variety of interests for all ages.Reserve at least two hours, three you really take your time in getting to now all the Oceanario has to teach you."

We paid \u20ac16 each including the temporary exhibition. Once in, we loved the sea turtles, and thought the whole place was just wonderful, with so many species to see. Unusually for a centre like this, the information boards (which were in Portuguese and English) were aimed at an 'intelligent adult' level, not just at kids, and the conservation message, although well expressed, was not 'pushy'. As well as many species of fish, there were penguins, sea birds and the absolute highlight - three stunning sea otters. Allow at least two to three hours in the main exhibition - there is A LOT to see. The cafe was busy so we chose not to eat there, but it seemed to do some good coffee, pastries and snacks. For a heartier lunch, there is a very wide choice of Portuguese and world cuisines (and the usual burger and pizza places) in the food court in the Vasco da Gama shopping centre nearby."

Hence, it is hard to avoid drawing comparisons.... The Oceanario is definitely a good aquarium - the large tank is impressive and there are nice exhibits of oddities like Dragonfish, Jellies etc. But, despite being large, it is on a much smaller scale than say Monterey Bay, and missing some of the wow factors you might find elsewhere (like acrylic viewing tunnels). So, don't be taken in by the \"largest in Europe\" claim - it is surely true, but doesn't really mean anything. Go there just expecting to see a good aquarium and you will not be disappointed.Turtles exhibit is small but nice and worth the 3 EUR extra in my opinion.

We spent almost two hours going through the different levels, around the central huge water tank.

Billed as the second largest aquarium in the world, I can think of several aquariums that I have visited in recent years that are far better than this oceanario.For an aquarium that is promoted as being so voluminous, the exhibits were quite small and unimpressive. The outdoor exhibits were tiny compared to others I have seen, and the oceanario did not have whales or walruses or other large marine life that one would expect from a first class aquarium. The temporary exhibit on sea turtles was also a huge disappointment, as there seemed to be only two or three of them and the tanks' windows were small and low to the ground, making for poor viewing conditions.I am sure that children would enjoy this aquarium, and it is certainly not a bad place to visit on a rainy day. But given our expectations for the second largest aquarium in the world, the oceanario failed measurably. I cannot for the life of me understand why this is so highly ranked on TripAdvisor."

A brilliant start to the holiday, even though a true tourist attraction.The aquarium has a central tank, and then quadrants coming off of it. It had animals in it which I have never seen in aquariums, such as penguins, birds flying overhead, otters and sea turtles. The temporary \"sea turtle\" exhibition is worth a look if you don't mind paying the 4 extra euro. Definitely be prepared for hoards of small children...The best bit was finding little secluded benches where you had your own view of the central aquarium. Easy to get to on the metro, which costs about 1.50 euro for a single trip.Make a point of asking for a STUDENT rate if you have a student card."

They have one part that is dedicated to reptiles that is incredible. They have frog in almost every color and size that can existe.This Oceanarium is a place that you can relax - so, if you are tired after a long travel to Lisbon, this is the perfect time to visit the Oceanarium. For me, you can easily spend more than 3 hours there, because everything is so big and so amazing that your attention is caught all the time and because of that, when you realize a lot of time has already passed."

It cost us 16eu each to get in to both the permanent and the temporary exhibits, however you can find 10% off vouchers in local free guide books. We found the Oceanario to be quite small but still beautiful. There is a huge tank in the middle with different species of fish, rays and sharks inside. You walk around through different exhibits including penguins, frogs, different water climates and my personal favourite - the otters. I guess we are a bit spoilt coming from Australia in that we have some amazing aquariums full of great white sharks, giant loggerhead turtles etc, so the Oceanario was quite small in comparison to us. But all the children there had a great time with their families and we really enjoyed ourselves too. A lovely way to spend part of a day, strolling around and then grabbing a drink and lunch on the water. You can get to the Oceanario from Lisbon by catching a 28 bus, though you will need to go to the metro station first to purchase a day-trip travel pass for 5.50eu."

I don't have kids, and didn't travel with any, but I would imagine that due to many interactive activities especially in the turtle exhibition, the aquarium is an awesome way to spend an afternoon in Lisbon if you're travelling with kids. The regular adult entry was 13 Euros, we paid 3 extra to also see the temporary turtle exhibition. While this might seem a little bit pricy, I would gladly pay it again. I loved the different overpasses and little tunnels and the presentation of information. There is a cafeteria style restaurant on the first floor, where you can get a soup, main dish, dessert, and drink for under 10 Euros. You can combine the visit to the aquarium with walking around the Parque das Nacoes, the area built for the Lisbon World Exposition."

Long tanks that would round the site so that you could see the turtles and fish from lots of angles, the best being the glass walkway that you stepped over. A little girl was lying on it watching the turtles eye to eye and I wished that I could do the same!The main area was beautiful, a very large central tank with all manner of creatures in there, including two divers! There were lots of viewing areas and in some places the glass was double height and as it was fairly quiet when we visited, there were times when you could just sit and watch what was going on with no one else around. It felt like you were in there with them. There were also four areas for the different oceans with otters, penguins and different fish found in different parts of the worlds oceans. So much variety and so cleverly set out that there was always something different to see. We spent at least two hours in there, a very good experience that will be long remembered."

Firstly, I should confess I am an amateur aquarium keeper so I get a bit more excited about public aquarium's than the average person but this is an excellent attraction. As well as the main tank which you see at different levels as you go round there are some cold water \"habitats\" complete with penguins and sea otters in open \"surface\" displays which you then get to see from underneath later, these are barely fenced off so you feel really up close though the birds are clipped which is a bit uncomfortable. There are some great, informative displays and an environmental message and I personally loved the film about how they maintain it all though I was the only one watching. We also visited the temporary Sea Turtle exhibition which was amazing and there is lots to see in the surrounding area and some good restaurant in an area which feels a bit like London's Canary Wharf."

It is set in a newly developed ares set up for expo 98, and the surrounding architecture is exciting.We went to the second floor to see the giant turtles. Both this floor and the floor below was a pageant of beauty and a monument to good care and conservation, so good it was hard to tear ourselves away after almost three hours. The fish and turtles swam so closely and against the backdrop of a kaleidoscope of colour. Every vantage point offered a 3d experience and you could watch the fish with extraordinary clarity at any number of levels. In one instance, we stood on thick glass with turtles swimming underneath. There was great ease of transfer between floors as I had to use a lift. In the permanent exhibition apart from the huge central aquarium, there was a section representing all the oceans in the world and we were thrilled to see penguins swimming underwater at speedThe conservation messages were direct, and uncluttered."

Climatic zones are reproduced in realistic detail, though I do worry about the total space for some of the animals (i.e. penguins.) Ironically, it is set in the middle of a small bay of water that would be perfect for the larger species that it houses - really a pity to see so many types of fish cooped up together in a central aquatic habitat, but, in the Oceanario's defense, they do take very very good care of their \"residents\".We paid an extra 4 Euros each for the special turtle exhibit which was a complete waste of money - there were 4 rescued turtles and a few token aquatic exhibits that were mini-versions of the exhibits in the main structure."

The \"temporary\" exhibition on sea turtles was well done, but really the main show was the central tank of the permanent exhibit. The architecture of the buildings is the first sign that there was as much care placed into the development of the exhibits as there was the protection of the marine wildlife. The variety of animals as well as the size of the main tank mean that you could spend hours staring at it. Additionally, the lighting is well done minimize glare, leading to some amazing photographs, if you are experienced with no flash relatively low light environments.

It consists of a huge main tank with an amazing array of animals including a manta ray and several large sharks. It even has penguins. The vistor descends slowly a ramp that winds down the exterior of the tank, affording many different views of the interior. Well worth the 15 euro entrance.To get there, take the Red metro line in the direction of Orient and get off at Orient. Go up the escalators and wend your way thru the mall. At the east entrance of the mall, you'll see a big rusty scuplture. Go on past that for few hundred yards until you hit the bay. The aquarium is right then a bit further to your right. Can't miss it as it is the only building surrounded by water.Tom"

Spent a half a day here with our 17yr old son waiting for wedding guests to arrive later on in the week, we used the 'not too complicated' Lisbon metro to reach it with just one train change and arrived around 10.30am.The aquarium is planned on 2 floors with the main tank in the centre and 4 different walk through climates at each corner.I was really impressed there was real ice and snow for the Humbolt penguins in the arctic corner, giant otters in the north atlantic corner, the hot humid environment in the rain forest corner.Some great pelagics in the main tank including a manta ray, sand tiger sharks etc. plus lots of other stuff such as interactive areas, video etc. ..... I would recommend this for all ages."

Many things have been said her about the aquarium but I think the highlights are the variety of ecossistems inside, the huge central tank, the otters and most of all the excellent breeding facilities that had led many species, some that hardly breed in captivity to bring light to new born kids."

The best thing to do is to exit the mall and then turn right but keep to your left. You will then find a three storey building to your left surrounded by water. The building is not very attractive from the outside but once you get inside you will be thrilled. The coral reefs were the best part for me but there are some very interesting species of fish etc. there. It cost 12 euro and I think that it's well worth the price. It took my husband and I about 3 hours to view the permanent exhibition only but that was because we just sat and absorbed the fish, sharks etc. in the main aquarium for about 45 minutes. If you are not really interested in what can be found in the many oceans of the world, this may be pretty boring for you. It would probably be more exciting for the kids as the ones who were there when I was there seemed to be having a blast!"

You could stand on a glass floor and watch them swim underneath or sit in a small cave-like place and let them fly over your head!

We liked how well organized the exhibits are, but it felt a bit crowded, perhaps it was because we visited on a Sunday afternoon. You definitely want to bring a camera to the Oceanarium, make sure your SD card is empty, as you find yourself wanting to take pictures of everything, especially the sea otters, which are adorable. This is definitely not a short visit, you should allow at least to 2 hours to see most things at at fairly speedy pace; but we think 3-4 hours are just about right, to be able to see everything with the detail it deserves. Needless to say, this is a kids paradise, so if you have children, you must definitely visit the Oceanarium while in Lisbon. And if you don't have kids like us, it's still a must visit in Lisbon."

The Temp exhibit we went to had Sea Turtles, the only bad thing was there was far too many people crammed in to what was a relatively small exhibit. A lot of barging was needed. The main exhibit though was wonderful. The sea otters were my favourite, could have watched them all day! We had a whole day to spend here (Oriente) but we were in the aquarium for about 3 hours, and we had to get the train to Faro later on that night so being so close to the train station worked out well. You can also go for a nice walk along the front, there's a big shopping centre too."

From there just take a 15 minutes walk to Oceanario. This place was trully amazing. I was expecting small aquariums but here you could see a huge tank filled with hundreds of different species including sharks and amazing sunfish. Moreover 25 additional small aquariums show every possible marine organism. Do not miss visiting three adorable sea otters and the temporary exhibition showing the loggerhead sea turtle. You can view him even underneath when he is swimming just above your head! After you have visited the Oceanarium take a walk along the shore or ride the cable car and get a nice view on Lisbon and The Vasco da Gama Bridge. Oceanario- a must when visiting Lisbon!!"

By the time we left three hours later is was much busier.The Oceanario is one of the largest in the world and is set on the edge of the River Tejo. The aquariums are on a huge scale and depict the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and Artic oceans and their diversity of sea life. You can view from two different levels - the lower level feels like you are under water. The windows are huge and give an uninterrupted view of the sea life.The information signs are in Portuguese and English and provide first class information about the oceans and their fragility without preaching about the environment. This approach is very thought provoking as you can see these beautiful creatures and be reminded how delicate their environment is.On our visit there was a special exhibition of sea turtles on the top floor. Again, not to be missed and very thought provoking. Do take a camera (flash photography is not allowed) although a video camera will give you the best memories to take home."

The \"Ocean\u00e1rio de Lisboa\", Europe's second largest sea aquarium, is well worth visiting, for adults as well as for children. It is extremely well done and has every ocean, from the Artic with ice and penguins to the Tropics with rays and sharks with a total of about 8,000 animals living there. It opened to the public in 1998, after the EXPO 98, where it was one of the major attractions. Besides the huge main tank which can be looked at in two levels - near surface and bottom, there are some 25 small aquariums, focussing on special points of interest. You will need at least 2-3hrs (if your kids don't get tired) to stroll through, rest at the large plexiglass windowss and watch the elegant rays, sleek sharks and houndreds of other fish gliding past. Don't miss the slide show just before the end of the tour which tells you a lot about the technical details of managing the huge Aquarium. Sometimes one can see divers feeding the fish or cleaning the rocks or windows. At the end you'll have to go through the Ocean\u00e1rio's souvenir shop. A very useful item to buy is the \"Guide OCEAN\u00c1RIO de LISBOA\" which has a wealth of well done explanations about the oceans of the world and the management of the aquarium. I visited the place the three times, once with my wife to get to know it, then with three of my 15yrs old dive students on a fish identification exercise and this week with my 7 yrs old grand daughter. No restrictions amatuer phographing or filming. It was worth it every time!"

We were not really psyched about spending our time and money at a touristy spot like this, but I have to say that we were very impressed. A special sea turtle exhibit was going on with a glass tunnel where the massive turtles swam right over and under us. I think we spent two hours watching all the creatures in the center tank and at the otter ponds. I have attached a photo of the center tank. The tickets were a bit pricy for our wallets, (15.50 each for a combo ticket that was good for the sea turtle exhibit and the regular exhibit). In the end it was money well spent and we had an awesome steak dinner at a restaurant across from the Oceanario but I cant remember the name of the place right now.

Once full, we then continued out the back of the mall, where you face the water front. Make a right, head straight down about 4-5 minutes and you will get to the Oceanario.You can't miss it. The building itself is cube shaped. The fee was around 15-17 Euro's pending if you wanted to go see the temporary exhibit or not. At the time we visited, the temporary exhibit featured \"Sea Turtles\". The rest of the oceanrium was very well maintained. There is one giant aquarium tank filled with all sorts of fish, sharks, sea-stars etc. As you tour the Oceanarium, you get different vantage points of that same tank, so don't get all stressed out if one window is full of people. Just keep walking and you WILL get about 20 or more chances to see it. There are separate rooms, as well, that feature penguins, pelicans, otters and one that has a tropical rainforest environment. Towards the end of the Oceanarium, there are smaller aquariums. One of them had a huge octopus and another was full of cniderians (jelly-fish)It took us about an hour and a half to visit the whole thing.

But this is a very modern structure in the country anyway (located in the 1998 Expo area) so it is different from anything you see in central Lisbon and therefore worth visiting. Bring a camera with you because on a sunny day you will want to take pictures not only of the animals (remember don't use flash) but also the waterfront next to the aquarium. It is very easy to find, takes around 10-15 minutes from the metro station and on the way you will see other relatively new buildings as well. I think you should allow the site to take at least two hours to visit.The permanent exhibition is amazing, with a main tank (about 3 meters tall) in the middle which you will keep surrounding and smaller rooms for species in different parts of the ocean. You will be able to look at some of the animals in a very close distance, like the penguins and birds, as there are no barriars inbetween. Absolutely love the sea otters, and I wasn't the only one because I noticed that people in general stayed to watch them for at least 10 minutes.There is also currently a temporary exhibition of sea turtles, which you pay an extra 3-4 euros to go into. These turtles are big and kids will definitely enjoy watching them."

So funny and cute!The central tank is very impressive with everything it contains, especially with its sharks swimming around slowly and imperially, like it owns the place. Very impressive!Also try not to pass by the lanternfish tank. It seems like a black window but when you get closer and pay attention, you'll see blinking little lights in the darkness. There's an interesting short video (about 20 to 30 minutes - in Portuguese subtitled in English) showing how the place is kept and cleaned, and the animals fed.If you're lucky, you'll get to see the 2 divers feeding the rays and all the other little fishies following the move.From what I gather, they organize sleep overs for kids: they set up their beds on the floor in front of the main thank. Must be quite a thing to do!! (I would myself!)One of the main purpose of the place is to promote ocean awareness. There's a lot of explanations on how to chose the right fish to eat (if fish you eat), how to spare and save water, sort your waste, etc... all at a child's level so that everyone understands and remembers. A bonus point from me for this!One advice: if you have half a day to spare, go for it!!"

            "review": "Fascinating trip across 3 oceans. I really enjoyed my visit to the Lisbon Oceanarium. At first, I was a bit terrified by the huge queue at the main entrance, but the ticket stale is organised perfectly and I didn\u2019t have to wait longer than 15 minutes. The whole Oceanarium consists of an enormous aquarium and many separate exhibitions \u2013 some are devoted to 3 oceans (Atlantic, Indian and Pacific) while other to different sea creatures. The main aquarium is located in the very centre of the building \u2013 during the visit and you walk around it from the top to the very bottom and you have the possibility to watch oceanic life on different levels. I love this idea. What\u2019s more, you can not only stay or sit among the crowd in front of a gigantic window with fish behind it, but you can also hide in the corner or other secret spot (there are plenty of them) and admire the sea life almost privately. \u2018Ocean\u2019 exhibitions are numerous aquariums showing fish, other animals and plants living in one of the oceans. There are also \u2018mini zoos\u2019 presenting life above an ocean. I especially liked the humid jungle at the shores of the Indian Ocean and freezing air of the Arctic Sea.There\u2019s also a section devoted to ecological issues and I really appreciate it. They give you a lot of simple advice on how to protect oceanic life. Almost all notices are in English. There are also many facilities for disabled people and children \u2013 everyone can enjoy this great trip across 3 oceans.In my opinion, the only disadvantage was too many tourists: sometimes I had difficulties watching some parts of exhibition because of the crowd."

The aquarium is easily accessible on foot from the \u201cOriente\u201d metro station (about 10 minutes). Normal ticket costs 12 Euro which is fair enough. The best way for seeing the sea creatures is to seat in front of one of the many \"windows\", so reserve enough time (I spent there 4 hours).The Oceanario provides very broad types of additional activities like guided tors, special lectures and so on\".Please note that in Oceanario it is not allowed to take pictures with flash, so take the tripod with you!"

So this is not a competely objective review, but... it's a great place and you can have lots of fun if you are willing to allow yourself to simply enjoy seeing all the wonderful fish, birds etc.We went there as a couple, no kids (if you don't count us) and had a very enjoyable experience. There were lots of kids around (but also adults) and everybody was having a good time. The central aquarium is really big and amazing from every side, but for us, the highlight was seeing the sea otters at play - we could have looked at them for hours (we definitely spent 20-30 minutes watching them). Beautiful, playful creatures, they just fill your heart with joy.Do yourself a favour - when you get tired of shopping or history or eating, take this enjoyable break."

It has one huge central tank in the centre and lots of small tanks on the side which copy different environments from around the world. I really felt like I was deep sea diving it really was quite magical. There was also different displays of tiny tanks with strange looking ocean creatures that look like they should be on an alien planet. It\u2019s a great day out for adults and kids\u2026and when I say kids I mean lots of them. We went on a Saturday and had to fight shouting kids, and hassled parents. If you are a parent make sure your kid doesn\u2019t bang on the tank, it really stresses the fish. My only complaint about the aquarium was the lack of information on the different species of fish I was looking at and the audio guide I paid for was soooo boring that I gave up trying to listen to it. Staff are not helpful either."

As an animal lover and vegetarian, I tend to feel a bit unsure about zoo-like attractions - however the Oceanarium is fascinating, modern, educational and with a real message - overfishing and pollution is a timebomb - we have to be more considerate!!! It's not just about the fish we eat but about the knock-on effect this has on the whole aquatic ecosystem ie. 'our' world, the planet earth.The central tank is just incredible - you can just spend hours sitting watching... and then there are four ocean environments which you experience from above (with birds and plants) and below - absolutely brilliant"

It's a perfectly nice aquarium, but if you live near a fancy aquarium at home, it is probably at least as exciting as the Oceanario. However, if you are looking for something to do in Lisbon, it is well worth a trip to go to the Oceanario in the morning to admire the fish, then take the cable car one way over the pier (not sure exactly where it is supposed to go), get off on the other side, and then walk back towards the Oceanario. When you walk back you will see a series of restaurants in the park along the pier. Have lunch there! I had a fantastic lunch at Senhor Peixe. From there you can walk back to Oriente and take the metro to your hotel, or go shopping in Vasco de Gama mall."

It is very well done with 4 different oceans and habitats depicted. Seeing the main tank at different levels as one makes ones way around allows for great views at different depths. The penguins swimming deep was a revelation. The sea otter must come from Hollywood the way he played to the audience. A great afternoon for young or old."

The Oceanarium is a primarly a giant tank that you walk around on 2 floors with many smaller tanks on the sides. There are then open areas that have different climates within - of note is an area where the penguins swim around - kids loved it. There is a gift shop and cafeteria on the ground floor - washrooms are located in here. Parking is easy to find with a garage a block away. Signage is very good to finding the attraction and parking"

He seemed to know he was the star and made many trips passed visitors.Several times, we just sat on the floor right up against the glass and stared at the passing fish. It was mesmorizing. They have a small \"behind the scenes\" section that explains things like quarenteen and raising the organisms before they go into bigger tanks. They also have a short film on loop about the oceanarium. Unfortunately, there was ZERO info on the sunfish in either the literature, movie, or gift shop. It is a perfect place to spend the hotter parts of the day, and the surrounding area has awesome shopping!"

We took the Metro to Orietnte station on the red line, got off & walked the short distance to it. It is very well done & worth a visit. Especially if you have young children with you, they will enjoy it! Yes, the \"Sun Fish\" is very impressive! This is not \"Sea World\" with dolphins doing tricks in large pools. It is a small oceanarium with very interesting tanks of sea animals to view. If you have an interest of marine life & the ecology of the oceans, you will enjoy this attraction."

And of course one of the places they want to after the zoo was the \u201cOcean\u00e1rio\u201d. We have been there 3 times already but it was the first time to my younger daughter (almost 4 years old). And she \u201cis in love\u201c with it! She would stay there for the all day if we let her. And for us is always magic to go there! Specially the lower floor with its darkness and sounds (please go to the website to listen the kind of sounds we hear there: the ocean itself!) and how special is to see that animals just near our feet. We feel like we are in the depth of ocean! Also the documentary and the exhibition about how the \u201cOcean\u00e1rio\u201d works is very pleasant (is spoken in Portuguese but it has sub-titles in English. By-the-way, all of the exhibits have brief but informative explanations in Portuguese and English, most of the time over the aquarium box we are looking at. The central aquarium has also written information on the side walls and because it is a little dark you may not see it right-way). Don\u2019t miss that! Go there!"

It is a very special aquarium - the best we've seen -- and should not be missed if you have an extra several hours in Lisbon. The Expo park is a taxi ride from downtown or the Eduardo VII Park area. When the taxi drops you, it still isn't obvious where the Oceanario building is and the signage isn't great. Just walk toward the river and you'll see it to your left. The really neat layout has a very large tank in the center with separate areas in each \"corner\" of the building representing the major ocean areas of the world. They all come together in the center -- representing the oneness of the world's oceans. All areas are viewed from many vantage points and on two levels. We were just enchanted. It's a wonderful break from cathedrals and museums."

I'm sure children of all ages would enjoy a trip to the Oeanarium. The little ones will enjoy looking out for 'Nemo'. All of the exhibits have brief but informative explanations and guides (and are occassionally interactive). The penguins and otters can be seen diving/swimming under water from the lower level. The entry fee is ten euros per adult and little ones under three get in for free."

Admission is 9 euros, with a small reduction for students. Well worth it. The huge central tank contains many species of shark, sunfish, manta rays and others, all co-existing in apparent harmony. There are some splended small fry, too, especially the sea-horses and sea-dragons, and the penguins and otters are also very popular. Well-stocked gift-shop and rather modest sandwich bar adjacent."
