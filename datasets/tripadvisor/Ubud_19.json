Now the legacy is carried forward by his equally talented son. It takes about 1 hour to go around the awesome museum to enjoy & appreciate the artwork. Balinese women portrayed in an artists vision is the theme of this museum & strongly recommended along with ARMA ( Ayung Rai Museum of Arts ) for Art lovers."

No way is this guy the Bali Dali, his paintings are definitely colonial era, the nubiile Bali breast through the perving gaze of the Italian painter. I wasn't impressed by his paintings, and there was little to no social commentary or anything about his wife the dancer. I much prefer Balinese wood carvings to this- very European and somewhat out of place."

            "review": "First fascination, then distaste. Once you climb the very steep hill to this ego-shrine of the artist, you are in a beautiful, well-kept, secluded green space above the city. The views from the restaurant where you get your artsy miniscule free post-visit drink are splendid and there is a breeze thanks to the elevation - might be worth climbing up just for that. The place is quite magical as you walk and discover different parts of the complex. The approach is often irreverent or light-hearted, e.g. the pompom earrings and marigold garland on the Ganesha statue form a smiley face as you ascend the stairs. The setting is glorious. Then you unexpectedly come to an area where a number of spectacular large colourful tropical birds are perched on a branch. A handler can put them on your person for photos if you wish. There is no denying these birds are majestic and breathtaking. Just wow at first, and then you start wondering how come these huge creatures just sit there on the branch all day and how they have been treated and trained (and their wings possibly clipped?) to provide tourist entertainment. One was jumping up and down as if he wanted to take flight somehow, despite the odds. You can see the cages with their successors from the windows of the gallery. The leaflet briefly mentions conservation but this was not at all clear from the exhibit. You then enter the main museum building (no photos inside). The artist was somewhat talented as evidenced by a number of vaguely impressionistic portraits with a human spark in the eyes. He created elaborate stylized frames to go with his works - to me, while interesting, these are not appealing. They have a whimsical, vaguely shabby chic aesthetic. A terrace with gilded dancer statues surrounds the cupola - nice views again. The majority of the paintings are of native subjects (Balinese nubile women) in various states of undress. They always have their breasts exposed, frequently more. Some expat women are thrown in for good measure, sprawled naked across sofas and daybeds, more than once with a big round glass bottle for distilling wine straddled between their legs. I have nothing against nudity in painting. Yet, the works, which meld into one after a while, seemed to whisper to me of narcissistic ego-mania, exploitation, patriarchy and privilege - male, white and mystical-artsy. I felt uncomfortable for these women and the sleazy old uncle character (as another reviewer aptly put it) as artist approaching their innocent bodies for \"art\" or money. It is not something I endorse. Many people just seem to follow the it's-art-and-in-a-museum-so-it's-respectable-and-ok line but this seems facile. I have been to Dali's houses in Figueres and Cadaques and while extravagant and provocative, self-obsessed Dali at least was doing his own thing, the first to do so and constantly evolving, experimenting with all the power symbols and taboos, not just sex but also religion, power, masculinity, art norms, etc. In this light, his fellow Catalan seems like an imitator with a more traditional brush, more narrow interests (local perky breasts) and seaside-gallery frames that did not seem tongue-in-cheek in their kitsch. Superimposed with a copied Dali persona, including in the way he dressed. While side by side with Dali in his native Catalonia he would have been derided, his copycat mysterious Western artist-traveller persona had purchase where he ended up, and his white male artsy quirkiness earned him quite traditional privileges, including a huge prime piece of land from the local authorities, I fear, helping secure his position to attract new talent to pose for his works. It is a shame his artist son has decided to imitate his father's style exactly to the point you cannot tell them apart. I think a few frank interviews with the subjects would nicely balance out the exhibit. A beautiful, serene, quirky place with average art and worrying undertones for this viewer."

After meeting Don in his studio pit in 1996, we were heartened to find that the museum ( it's really a massive gallery) had been established in memory of Ubuds famous artist. The museum is a \"must see\" for anyone interested in art. It was gratifying to see works exhibited by Antonio's son, who carries on the Blanco tradition. Staff were very welcoming and provided interesting explanation on the history of the gallery."

'Western Decadence Enters Bali' sort of thing. However, it is worth visiting if you know his art a little and know you'll like it, but it is not to my taste. An interesting piece of 'recent history', though.The area immediately around the Museum is great for shopping and places to eat. The road up to Penestanan goes steeply up alongside the museum. Well worth a walk up there for juice bars, cafes, clothes shopping, also."

Strong vibrant Colors on walls, elaborate staircase,Paintings mostly framed in elaborately carved frames - sounds over the top but does justice to art, furniture and artefacts.Did not know of this artist before visiting museum - he was eccentric,In both appearance and probably his Spanish background comes to the fore here.

Obviously had intense passion for the female form and a majority of work there proves thatHouse was family home & studioWhich is still in use as son followed in Antonio's footsteps.Also a great gift shop on grounds selling jewellery and other Balinese goods - probably of better quality than markets (maybe)Also restaurant there which we stopped for refreshments and took in the well manicured garden.Attracts lots of visitors and there is an entrance fee.

I payed 6$ entrance for this place which is inordinate expensive for a museum in this place. Once you enter you walk through a very nice garden where you can take some photos with parrots, and then enter the main building of the museum. It is an old aristocratic building with two floors, all of them covered only by paintings of mr. Blanco which is kind boring. I cannot say i was impressed but i am amateur with art. After spending 30 min. inside we went to the terrace where there is an outdoor bar with one of the most amazing views and we were offered our welcome juice shoots."

It wasn\u2019t artistic; it was pornographic. I mean, probably 80% of the paintings were of nude women; that\u2019s not surprising (unoriginal, but no surprise). But the legs spread? VULGER.

I personally found it rather distasteful as it was overtly just about that. I did however find the frames for the works beautiful and conversation pieces themselves. My main grouse is that it was incredibly hot in the museum. The 2 fans on the first level just sent the warm air circulating just in that corner. I had to leave shortly after as I found the heat unbearable. It was much cooler outside in the open and the kids enjoyed taking photos with the birds, parrots and especially the hornbill which was the highlight of our visit. The restaurant had pleasant views and was great to chill in. Unlikely to return."

But they are not. As another reviewer has noted, invest your time and money instead in the excellent Puri Lukisan - the museum of Balinese art close to the Palace; you will be amply rewarded and leave Ubud feeling artistically and culturally refreshed."

Blanco's erotic-expressionism gave us intimate view in women's body as a special artistic muse."

He came to Bali in the 50's, stayed and married here. He painted little risque paintings with a penchant for pompous frames. He seemed to have Salvador Dali as idol. The museum was originally built on land that Ubuds king donated to him and built to keep his gallery. His son, also an artist, use today his father's painting studio. "

Guess I should have done my homework on the work of Blanco before going.. just turned out to be naked woman after naked woman and sorry but not done very well either.. but that obviously a personal opinion. what bugged me more was the terribly officious manner of the staff .. not used to having folks in Bali be so snooty.. other real sore point is the caged birds.. no need for this at all and as for the parrots - didn't know they were indigenous to Bali ..!! they would have been better off in their natural habitat in south America. The grounds and building are very lovely and there is a spectacular view from the top of the building but for me filled half an hour of my holiday"

Just like in Monumen Perjuangan Rakyat Bali, the museum has a park, a main building and some small building which also have some paintings in it. You can take some picture in these building, but not at the main. You only can see the paintings and the view from the top of the main building. There are some histories, too in the museum. When I explored the park, I also found a peacock and some parrots at the park. For a local tourist, i just spent 30k to get inside.You can go to museum Antonio by walking from The Monkey Forest, but it was around 2 km. I love to take a walk because I can have sightseeing along the way. There\u2019s also a good spot when you getting near the museum and you can also crossed a beautiful bridge just next to the museum gate."

As for the art, it is interesting albeit not quite my taste. The entrance tickets are on the pricey side.

But in the context of Bali, and more especially Ubud where art and harmony are everywhere, this place is quite grotesque. An unparalleled monument to egocentric narcissism, entrance is thru an archway formed by... the mirror-image of the \"artist's\" signature. Made of Italian marble it is 15 metres high because he was born on the 15th. As for his paintings, Blanco was clearly a competent draughtsman but his subject matter his sense of colour and overblown frames are totally kitsch. He even tried his hand at poetry, some of which is shamelessly on display, but like the rest it is total gibberish. One shudders to think what the Balinese must have thought of this pretentious rubbish as representative of Western art. To be avoided at all costs!"

In the description under one of his paintings, Blanco explains what he believes is the meaning of life: \u201cA fresh mango in one hand and my left hand placed on the firm [backside] of an 18 year old.\u201d His paintings reflect this philosophy; most of his works involve young, well-endowed women posing in their birthday suits. (I'm trying hard to conform to Tripadvisor family-friendly policy; it's not easy given the nature of the art). The paintings aren't crude and I have no problem with this style of art. However, I left feeling Blanco created his paintings to live in his own fantasy world rather than seeing him as a serious artist with something interesting and worthwhile to share."

The paintings have a distinct dreamy like romantic style, all of nude balinese women. Some of his later work was quite kinky and sexual. We enjoyed the museum very much, however only took us about 30 minutes to browse. I suppose if you took you time , it would take you a maximum 1 hour to look through . We didnt have any guides which would have been nice , like some other reviewers. We did see some guides bringing other couples around, and looking back it would have been better to have them explain the paintings to us , since some of them appeared to have some deeper meanings. The main building was two floors and had maybe 80 or so paintings, there was also an area that housed some of his son's current paintings. Near the end you could purchase some high quality prints signed by the late artist himself and with his unique styled frames (the priced ranged from USD$800 - $1500 ). There is also a gallery of photos of the late artist, his family , and guests.Overall was a great day activity and the works were beautiful.

The review also said not appropriate for kids - we have a 10 year old, and it was great. The restaurant at this place is pricier, but nice. The museum area has a lot of nice birds that will sit on your arm, the painting frames and buildings are interesting, more than the paintings themselves. The museum store is not good."

As gaudy, tacky and overly eccentric as the collection and the museum itself is, it is well worth a visit - even if just for a quick look around if you're passing by. I don't usually find myself captivated by art - and am often bored at galleries and museums - however I found this collection fascinating. There is such overwhelming authenticity and creativity to everything, and it's hard not to be drawn in, whether you personally find his romantic-expressive kind of work appealing or not. Needless to say, there are a lot of female nudes! The garden is beautiful, and the exotic birds are stunning; the surroundings are stunning, and the garden offers incredible views over the valley and the river. Well worth a visit for all these different reasons (and, really, you won't need longer than an hour max)."

            "review": "Dali-esque but not quite. Antonio Blanco was born in the Philippines to Spanish parents. In his early 40's he went to Bali where he met his wife, a noted Balinese dancer. He was Bali's most famous foreign artist. He has won many awards. His house was converted into a museum and it has become a must-see destination for art lovers. Many of the paintings are of female Balinese nudes with over-sized bosoms done in a flamboyant but non-erotic style. He also created artwork involving Michael Jackson and other celebrities. Having been to Salvador Dali's museum in Figueres, Spain, the Blanco museum reminded me of Dali. By mistake, I entered the Blanco museum in the reverse order (at the exit, i.e., museum store) where I managed to take some photos of the interior. I was later told that no photography was allowed, in contrast to many international museums I have visited. I was not able to avail of a museum guide and I just walked around and let my senses direct me towards what was pleasant or not.Overall, although it did not impress me as an experienced international museum visitor, my one-hour stay was adequately satisfying. If you love art. then a visit to this museum in Ubud is worth the entrance fee."

Think young, topless Indonesian female nudes painted in garish blues and pinks with flamboyant pseudo-Indonesian style wood carved frames, housed in a fun house two-story gallery garishly painted in blues and reds with a high domed ceiling. Think Baz Luhrmann with poorer taste and less money. I lasted 15 minutes. The artist seemed like an eccentric euro whacko, so I would have loved a lot more info on him and how he ended up creating his lurid kingdom here in Ubud. Apparently his son has taken over the mantle and is a budding artist too, although he's been relegated one small room to display his slightly more contemporary works, consisting of collages of Michael Jackson and other folk, pictures cut up and pasted upon small paintings clearly influenced by his fathers fetish for young nudes. Give it a miss unless you're not bothered by the entrance fee."

We paid about 80,000Rp/person for a tour of sparsely arranged artworks displayed in a 2-storey high building (despite having such a big compound). The brochure says that there is a bird park which is essentially a stand with a few parrots. I would say that money has been pumped into decors of the building rather than the actual customer experience. More could be done to enhance the understanding and appreciation of the artworks rather that creating more distractions and earning opportunities for what is essentially a museum."

His talent and technique are apparent in his works of art, if you can look past some of the less conventional styles. Some work is reminiscent of Di Vinci's drawings where one particular area is the subject of the attention and all other strokes are merely composition, but does this make bad art?

Roads are no longer so friendly to pedestrians . Roads are no longer offering coolness fields or smell the fragrance of incense prayer. Ubud has changed comrades . Ubud is not like 1992 first , when my first time through the streets of Bali . Once the soft whisper of heart jerking my consciousness . Once the soft whisper of heart jerking my consciousness .Changes that must adapt to its time . The Blanco Reanissance Arts Museum or the more familiar with the Museum Antonio Blanco . To fulfill the wishes of the lover , the son of Mario Antonio Blanco Jr. , tried to provide an alternative to build a museum to ' taste ' the brave. Museum actually been initiated by Don Antonio Blanco in 1998. However, age seems unable to ' hold' . He died in 1999 .Determination to complete the task of the father that seems to make the spirit of Mario Blanco on. Various art activities both locally and internationally are followed. Mario is a hard worker . Until Don Antonio Blanco museum can implement soft opening on September 15 , 2001. To coincide well with the 1st century birth anniversary of his father, Don Antonio Blanco .Quite thick blend between Bali and Spain on the building is clearly visible on the exterior design . Built on an area of \u200b\u200b2 hectares, which is a gift from the King of Ubud , the museum complex is divided into several venues . It includes the main two-story museum with a collection of 300 paintings or objects such as art collections of Don Antonio Blanco . For in the main buildings , visitors are prohibited to take pictures / photograph . This is to prevent a quick photo damaged by a flash of UV light from the flash. Given the paintings presented in ' naked ' , without being offered a glass protector . In addition of course, there are other reasons of worrying about the case of plagiarism .Supporting part of which is ' Rondji Resto ' located on the left side of the road before entering the museum . Next is a gallery / workshop . Here visitors can see some of the works of his son Mario Blanco who has a different flow of painting with his father . Gift soft , which provides a variety of souvenirs and replicas of paintings of the maestro . In other parts , visitors can watch a movie in the amphitheater or a mini cinema . In the mini- theater , visitors can watch the film series Fire Love Antonio Blanco ( Colour of Love ) . The film tells the journey of love between Don Blanco and Ni Rondji , painting models at once later married.While on the outside of the other , there is a family temple built with quite magnificent and artistic . It is located directly opposite the entrance to the museum . Behind him , there is a rare breeding birds native Bali , the Bali Starling . According bli Warsana , one of the employees of the captivity , this time bred amount is not much . ' Only ' 50 pairs Bali Starling only. Here for those who want , can buy Bali Starling with high quality . For buyers will be secured by a certificate which is proof of the authenticity of the offspring.On the right side , or midway between the family temple and museum , standing with magnificent family home also Mario Blanco . Despite having several houses in London or another city, most of the time Mario Blanco spent in the house. Therefore, almost all corners of the museum complex arranged so pretty . So that every visitor can take pictures with varied backgrounds , ranging from classic to contemporary impressions available ."

We were able to stroke the hornbill as he sat on our arms and he was very gentle. Also really enjoyed the art museum, the paintings and the poems were good, some funny. The English speaking female guide gave lots of information which was very interesting. Spent a couple of hours here in the cool shade of the gardens."

Now I'm not art buff but the paintings and poems are interesting, as is the people that Don Antonio interacted with.The gardens are small but well maintained and there are bird cages dotted all around. As you enter the garden you will find a few parrots and a hornbill sat waiting for photos. A quick stroke and a nudge and the hornbill will step right up, and just like the rest of Bali at no extra charge.The money to time ratio is good as we were there about 1 1/2 hours at IDR 150,000 for the both of us."

From the entrance door, we go through and will seeing varies of beautiful birds. Some of the birds were so friendly, we can take a photo together with them.Then, move to the inside, in the building we were prohibited to bring camera and drink. That's what the signs told us. So I just bring my phone and took several pictures silently. Most of the paintings were pictured naked women. I read the description under the photos, Antonio Blanco's models were vary and international. He also painted Michael Jackson. Then I read the \"Bali-breast\" article. It said that during the past, women in some area in Bali were half naked doing their activities. And it was because of a tradition that formed their breast muscle into a great shape, when the ceremony held, they always bring the things to offering to god, and they put on top of their head. The exercise that they've been done formed their muscle around shoulders and chest. Now that makes me thinking to start doing that exercise, ha!"

Symptoms lasted over 36hrs.It's only small( like a short). We were told there is vanilla essence and citrus juice in it. But it taste like cheap perfume. I suspect they have used essential oils (not for human consumption)in it. I only had a small taste. My partner finished it. And he had more nasty symptoms afterwards.DO NOT DRINK IT. We learned it the hard way. Maybe it's not poisoning everyday. But, do you want to try your luck??? Don't forget Advanced Medical Service is NOT AVAILABLE here.-----------------------------------------------------The museum itself was quite unique. You can go to the roof and have a better view of surrounding area. (You are allowed to photos once u are on the roof)------------------------------------------------------BirdsI scared of animals. Having chicken walking all over the place was very stressful for me. The three big birds standing on the tree at garden entrance are really beautiful. But they barely moved for a long time. I asked the staff, they cannot answer why.( must be a story behind them) I don't mind IF \"they are rescued from somewhere, cannot fly any more...\" But I don't think that's the case. They would have made an introduction about it if that's the story.I don't think they are pinned on the tree. Because I saw one jumped (not fly) off the tree step by step when I left."

We were suprised at the entrance price which amounted to about $16 AUS for both of us. We are bird owners and lovers, and we were shocked at the condition of the cages and displayed birds. Almost none of the many cages had any water available at all!! Let alone food!! The aviaries were filthy and there was a verandah area in which young eclectus parrots and other assorted birds were crammed into tiny cages with no food or water. The food trays for the macaws were appalling amd summed up the incredibly poor diet on offer to them. The blue and gold macaw posing for photos with tourists was very underweight amd obviously prone to feather plucking. Seeing the birds treated in this way prevented us from enjoying the museum. Though the grounds and building were attractive, the art was hardly the work of a master artist. The building itself was obviously built as a shrine to the artist's inflated ego. Based on the treatment of the birds I will not recommend this place to anyone. Better to spend your money visiting Bali Bird Park or another of Ubud's art museums."

The building is sumptuous in design and the two floors are open and airy. Climb to the top floor, up the circular staircase for stunning views over the river and ridge and admire the golden statues around the perimeter. Wander through the luscious gardens and finish with a complementarydrink in the restaurant ( named after his wife)and perhaps a snack to stay longer in the quiet surrounds.

On the top floor of the pavilion you can go out onto the balcony where you will get a wide view of the Campuan locale but if you're game and fit enough you can climb the spiral steel stairs onto the roof and have an even better view. I had the pleasure of meeting Antonio Balnco (three times) and also had the privilege of seeing him paint in his old studio which is connected to the new pavilion.

The deceased artist Don Antonio Blanco was described as The Dali of Bali for good reason. Really interesting museum which I highly recommend."

Now only the museum is open to the public and no photo inside. Blanco's paintings usually express his adoration of woman, little variations exhibit. Each picture has its own frame designed by Blanco, full of artistic merits. Without the help of a guided lady, you may not see two pictures behind the locked panels, more than that she will also give you a better understanding of the collection. Trained bird sits on your shoulder so that you can take a beautiful picture. A free drink is also offered at the nearby restaurant."

Much more than a gallery, you get to look into the life of this fascinating man and his family and to top it off with a drink (and more if you wish) at the restaurant with great service and a wonderful view. And his art is glorious IMHO. Sensual and sumptuous, each piece is has a frame designed by Blanco and carved by local craftsmen with hidden jokes and cheeky additions that add to the story of the painting. If you can, get the guided tour from the beautiful young lady who looks after the gallery. It added so much to my understanding."

I quite liked his use of colour in them. But he's not just about nude portraits. There's lots of other artwork there too, and it's easy to see surrealist influences. As someone mentioned, check out some of the frames too? I guess it was inevitable they would come up with the 'Dali of Bali' term. But he could obviously turn his hand to more classical representations - the guilded statues perched on top of the museum (I'm assuming that was him too.) for instance.I thoroughly enjoyed it. If nothing else, it's in a tremendous location. I wouldn't mind a bit of real estate there!"

Oh, and the art isn't that crash hot either.To get to the museum - which is more Vegas than Vatican - you walk through a lush garden of exotic birds, which appear to have been sedated or stapled to the trees (or both), and underneath a monumental triumphal arch, which is the artist's 'signature' - like a Stalin commission to Gaudi.The art gracing the walls consists mainly of half naked mid-to-late adolescent women, some supine, engaging in various interesting - but not family friendly - activities. Initially I thought the frames surrounding the artwork had been created by a mescaline addled arts co-operative, but no, the artist took credit for those as well.Luckily you can get through this all rather quickly - 30 minutes is enough - provided that the naff Three Tenors muzak doesn't drive you out before that.I would give this 'attraction' one star, but its monumental hideousness caused a rupture in the time space continuum - a bit like a red giant star of kitsch collapsing in on itself causing a black hole in the fabric of good taste - such that this, most certainly, was the most amazing thing my mere human eyes have ever witnessed to date. 5 stars!(Oh and the gift store is pants too)."

Surprisingly when you come to Bali expect incredible art in galleries, museums, on the street, in hotels/restaurants- the beauty of Balinese art surrounds you with education on its culture, religion, history, and daily lifestyles. With this said, the artist who spread awareness to the talent and potential of the Balinese art scene was Antonio Blanco. He was passionate about sharing his gift with the world and wanted people to promote Bali as not just a tourist destination, but an artistic wonderland. The museum he created has thought behind each and every detail- the frames to the three levels being the mountain, tree, and sea( I think have those right). The frames that are described as \"Gawdy\" were all designed by him with unique connections to the painting. The erotic paintings may have been a little overwhelming for some, but even those had significance. He was definitely not egotistical when 90 percent of the art was of his wife, friends, celebrities, or Russian/Japanese models. From a complete art snob who has seen museums, galleries, and met artists from all over the world- this man had talent. He was not a sell out trying to make money. If that was the case he would be selling his art to big museums and put himself in all the big cities. He is not Salvador Dali, but they definitely have their similarities and incredibly creative minds. Yes, the admission is a bit high in comparison to other galleries, but you are paying for an experience and need to take time to enjoy the art- when you can appreciate it that will make it worth it. If the gallery is not impressing you; then there are beautiful grounds to walk around and listen to the birds. The restaurant has beautiful views, amazing staff of people, great food and drinks and if you go on Sunday they have brunch followed by a BBQ with great electronic music DJ. Agreed, the drink needs to be replaced with something refreshing and not so strong. After spending 4 hours there between the museum and restaurant, having a guide, speaking with the staff that work there both inside the museum and In the restaurant- I learned about what goes on there and I witnessed as I watched people go around the museum(psychoanalysts watch everything).People don't know how to properly view art. If you expect to look at a painting and understand it by looking for 3 seconds and going on to the next- you shouldn't be in a museum. I watched several people laugh at the paintings- not reading the poetry, not with a guide, and with groups socializing. Not a quite experience there as people are talking loudly with no censor. I spoke with the woman in the studio and she said the same thing I just wrote above and this was my observation before she said it. People just don't appreciate art enough- not just here but in many museums. I'm not sure what people expect when they don't know the significance because they don't try to learn about it. Did anyone pay attention to his two signatures, the colors of paint and the changes between the female body, his multiple family photos? What about his son who is equally as talented and walks around the property open to share and have people learn? People don't take advantage of opportunities and then they complain and make false accusations. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but make sure you see the big picture before you comment. I highly recommend seeing this museum. Take time to talk with the staff who are lovely and welcoming, get a guide, spend time going around a couple times, and enjoy a nice relaxing view from the top and a drink-ginger lemonade is amazing! -PCR-"

Overall the artistic value of the pieces is close to none. The painter, who awarded himself with the nickname \"the Dali from Bali\", is to the surrealist painter what Il Divo is to the Three Tenors.To make things worse, the interiors are pompous and kitsch (Liberace-kitsch), the surroundings are so-so and the free iced-tea that comes with the entrance fee is so sweet that could transform a healthy person into a half-dying diabetic with only one sip. Ah, don't forget that the entrance fee is an astonishing 80.000 IRD.Stay away from it."

OK, I had a bit of fun in this so-called \"museum\", although the creator and subject of this monument to his own genius must have been a sleazy egomaniac. The paintings are more or less competent kitsch, displayed in gilt-heavy frames. The reason to visit is the completely over the top main building - Liberace baroque or something like that. The place is good for a laugh, but hardly worth the 80.000 rp entrance fee."

His main theme; Exploitation of women, the entrance is an archway depicting the female form as an insect and you enter thru between her legs. But objectifying and dehumanising women wasn't enough. His second theme is the exploitation of the Balinese people. Depicting nude or semi-nude Balinese women ( culturally, very conservative) with dildos. To add insult to injury I could hear a female Balinese guide explain these themes straight faced to a bunch of western tourists.The final act of horror and the main reason I took to review on TripAdvisor, was the cruelty in which they kept they're birds. Beautiful huge rainforest birds, cockatoos, peacocks and many more self mutilating in tiny cages with little or no water. Was truly disgusting. Really, really sad.

Walked through the lovely entrance and grounds and took pics with the colourful birds before arriving at the museum proper. The building was as flamboyant as the art and the few pieces of Versace furniture didn't look out of place! Enjoyed the paintings with their custom-made frames. Although hot at that time, the outdoor roof terraces with their golden dancer-statues and great views were definitely a highlight for me. After that, there was a small room of erotic art (which may not be for everyone), the artist's old studio, paintings by his son Mario and a shop. The video about the artist looked interesting but we skipped that.Ended the visit at the adjacent Rondji (named after his dancer-wife) restaurant to have the complimentary drink and stayed on for a nice lunch too. Then we walked farther up the road to the village of Penestenan - didn't enjoy that because of the traffic on the narrow road."

Inside, the artist's style ranges from classic portraits to some seriously bizarre and sometimes disturbing stuff! His ability to capture faces and expressions makes one think they must be looking at a photograph at times, they feel so real. It's worth noting that many of the pieces are not just about the canvas, but the frame that surrounds and completes the piece as a whole, and are often done by the artist as well. Taking the time to read the fine prints of the last exhibit area will result in a lot of raised eyebrows and occasional \"What the...?\"s. I think that watching other viewers' faces while reading these peculiar pieces would also be extremely amusing. Mr. Blanco was definitely an interesting fellow!"

The art is erotic, so for those who have issues with the human body, you may not like it. I really enjoyed the art, but what made it amusing was the descriptions that Blanco added to some of the paintings. They made me laugh out loud. His descriptions of some of his pieces are pretty funny, and make you think. Another pro was the open roof accessed by an iron spiral staircase. Beautiful statues, beautiful view, great for pictures. Definitely worth a visit!"

We didn't visit any other museums so no comparisons to match to but it was interesting. The surroundings with the nature of Ubud are nice and the building is interesting. The paintings are especially intriguing because the frames were also designed by Blanco. There is plenty to see here. The house is very remarkable in terms of style and color. Very different from the museums in Europe ;)"

He had a collage of painting and fabric and comments when Michael Jackson came to see him . It was kind of a shrine to him. Most painting looked like sketches, and water color of nude local women. His modern work, in the gift shop area, looked like horizontal and vertical color lines on canvas. I think , I did not get his drift. He was an unusual character, as depicted in his photos. He is extreamly forced as a bug eyed man. Barong the good god, is also bug eyed. Photos of his family were interesting. The help was good. There is a resturant there and a large collection of LIVE birds in different cages."

Begins with exotic birds perched on stands for photos, which you later find are kept in tiny cages round the back of the building - totally unnecessary.The purpose built building is practically Disney-esque and lavishly decorated to within an inch of its life, Il Divo are the soundtrack in the gallery.The techniques used on the paintings are interesting and some are very nice, but overall it's very self-indulgent. The painter and his museums awards are positioned in prime places around the rooms. The views on the rooftop make the ticket price almost worth it.Exit is straight through the gift shop, followed by Blancos \"workshop\" which is again filled with photos (one with Michael Jackson which could explain a lot) and quotes about the painter (\"the Dali of Bali' - I think not!).There are better art museums in Bali with real traditional Balinese art which would be a much more worthwhile trip."

Paintings, sculpture, gardens, and even exotic birds. Go with an open mind and appreciate the opus of a Latino artist living in Ubud in the 1950s. I really enjoyed the studio room where the docent provides lemongrass tea for your comfort. The roof sculpture garden provides exceptional views of the Campuhan area of Ubud. Blanco's work runs the gamut from portraits to quasi-erotic paintings. He gently crosses the line into 'kinky'. I found it quite tongue-in-cheek."

A guide will happily place two birds on your hand and shoulder to pose for pictures if you'd like.The grounds are also beautiful and worth a poke around. Our admission included two drinks which we enjoyed at the restaurant upstairs with a beautiful view overlooking Ubud.The museum/gallery itself is the perfect size. I don't have much of an eye for art but do have a short attention span, and this place was just the right amount to look at. If you are able to strike up a conversation with the young employee, he is actually a wealth of knowledge and can give you much-needed insight into many of the pieces. He also hilariously showed us a bunch of the more X-rated features in the final room of the gallery, many of which are tactfully covered by other pieces of art and would go unnoticed without the guide drawing attention to them.I didn't necessarily love all of the art (and indeed found some of the poetry too vulgar and bizarre for my tastes), however I was certainly intrigued enough to look at almost every piece - a pretty rare museum experience for me."

While I had never heard of the \"Dali of Bali\", the museum grounds and the studio Mr. Blanco built on top of a mountain overlooking the Campuan River are indeed beautiful if not breath taking, I had difficulty appreciating Mr. Blanco's art. That is not to say that I did not enjoy my visit. The flora and the fauna on the Museum grounds were beautiful if not bordering on the surreal. I loved the many flower varieties that were blooming, as well as the many beautiful exotic birds. The building is unique and one can climb the stairs to the upper floors and admire at your leisure the many paintings, watercolors, collages and drawings on display. I noticed that Mr. Blanco took an \"avant garde\" stand in his art against alcohol, tobacco and drugs way back in the 1940's and 1950's. The price of admission is in my opinion reasonable. Besides, one is treated to a refreshing drink in the restaurant at the end of the visit.Glad I visited the Blanco Museum."

There is no charge for this apart from the entry fee of 50,000.00 rupee. The interior of the museum is beautiful. You can almost feel the artists presence. The art work is magnificent but unfortunately his nude works have been defaced. They have sprayed a substance on the glass to cover some of the detail. I have never seen this done anywhere else. Art is art. A great restaurant at the top with beautiful views is worth a visit. Very friendly staff and the menu has a good range of food. Half the menu is Spanish food and the other Indonesia."

My husband and I enjoyed our visit very much although the paintings were not to our taste, we still admired them and their unusual bespoke frames. The gallery is in an extraordinary and eccentric building designed by Don Blanco and completed after his death. His studio was very interesting to see, just as though he had stepped out for a short break. The thing we most enjoyed were the grounds and the wonderful restaurant high up looking over Ubud. You really feel as though you are in the treetops looking down. We didn't have time for a meal, but we enjoyed our complimentary iced drinks and came back to admire the view and have more drinks before leaving. The newish manager was most welcoming and professional, he speaks good English and told us of his plans for this underused facility. I recommend it highly for its location, spacious facilities, stylish furniture and friendly atmosphere."

It is entirely devoted to the work of Don Antonio Blanco, a Spaniard who moved to Bali in 1952 and married a Balinese dancer, Ni Rondji. His style is described as expressionist- romantic- most of his paintings suggest a fixation with the female breast. The frames for his paintings are unique- unlike anything I've seen elsewhere in the world. The surrounding grounds complete the fantasy theme. A very unusual place!"

Until this museum eliminates the clipped-wing parrots and tiny cages jammed with other birds all over the grounds, it is not up to a standard any self-respecting tourist should want to patronize. Parrot in the first photo screeched in frustration when I was there, weaving its body in flight simulation and flapping useless clipped wings. Imagine being forced to grip a branch the rest of your life when your body is made for flying. One parrot hung from cage ceiling to relieve its feet (see photo). Birds normally have the entire sky as their habitat - now confined to 2 ft square space. They flap like mad (see photo) until they give up and stand there the rest of their pathetic lives. This cheesy approach to captivate tourists should be gone the way of the petting zoo and dodo bird. If your art is good enough, why should you have to sacrifice birds to attract tourists? Write a review like this if you agree. Maybe they will stop. (Photos are only a sample - there are numerous caged birds on site.)"

Mr. Blanco was highly inspired by the woman who would walk around bare chested with stuff balanced on their heads and it reflects in his subject matters.Definitely would recommend for a stop by to see the Dali-esque nudes and other drawings.

You don't feel like you're in a gallery.The museum is the kind where you are not overloaded with images. It allows you to enjoy them as much as you enjoy the surroundings.Highly recommended."

You then have to catch your breathe for the amazing view over the hilltops of Ubud. The gardens are just beautiful to walk around. There are some amazing tame maccaws and other birds that you can get your photo taken with. And at no extra cost to the entrance fee, which is a rarity! The artwork of Don Antonia Blanco is something else. I won't describe it in detail, but suffice to say I felt like I was in a museum in either Spain or Italy. So ornate, so eclectic and that is just the frames of the artwork!His son who also is an artist is amazing as well, yet totally different styles. And then you walk into the actual studio where Don Antonio used to paint and his son still uses the studio, is such a privilege. Its quite an experience to sit where both artists were inspired to create such magnificent pieces.Well worth a visit for art lovers. And for those that aren't its a great visit to a beautiful location that although is so Bali...... It is so not Bali as well."

I can feel how much Don Antonio enjoyed his life with his beloved wife, a Balinese dancer, and how much he loved his life as a painter, father, husband and human being. He done a lot in introduce Bali and Balinese art to the world, every his exhibition he took his wife along and she would do the performance of Balinese dance on her husband's painting exhibition. Firstly, after we pay the entrance tickets we walk thru a narrow pathway up to the old building that before was a home of Antonio Blanco family. Then we turn to the left and welcomed by birds that are sitting on the artificial tree limb. Sometimes we can pick up our welcome drinks from the table in the garden in the front of the entrance to the Museum, or sometimes the staff will give it to us there. I love to enjoy their tranquil garden before we went home.I can close my eyes and feel the spirit in this place ..."

The gardens surrounding the place are nice and there are a bunch of different birds flapping around on the grass and in cages located around the gardens. A walk through the museum shows you the extravagance of Antonio Blanco. Overall, I have to say it did not click with me. The man obviously was very talented, but his paintings are mostly all nude women in various poses with water bottles and other trinkets scattered around. The frames of the paintings are also quite tacky. Once you've seen one painting of his you've seen them all. It gets boring quickly. It's not to everybody's taste but I guess it's worth to have seen it once at least."

The grounds and gallery building are worth seeing and there are some wonderfully colourful birds by the entrance. Blanco's art is at times mildly pornographic but he certaily celebrated the beauty of Balinese women. Much was just fair art but some pieces were well done. His frames are quite fascinating as they are very definitely a created part of the paintings. The humidity of Bali is not being kind to some of the pieces and components and there appears to be serious deterioration to some works. Overall the art I did not find that great but it is a pleasant place to spend an hour. There is an attached restaurant that overlooks the Campuan River. For all his eccentricities he certainly is not a Dali."

The repetative, boring still lifes and portriats indicate his basic training, but he never gained more than a mildly talented art school student.The location itself in Ubud is ideal, with beautiful views nearby, but you can skip this if you are looking for nteresting art."

The gardens were beautiful, the birds exquisite and colourful, the art work and frames were spellbinding and the building which housed Blancos masterpieces was jaw dropping. I thoroughly enjoyed walking the grounds and viewing his unique works in their beautiful museum setting. He was a quirky character with an interesting life story that I would like to learn more of. Its no wonder he fell in love with Ubud and the Balinese people. I also loved viewing his actual studio which remains much the same as it did when he was working in it. I wanted to purchase the book of his works and story but found $100 AUD a little expensive. Will just have to google more on him! I bet a movie made on his life would be an interesting one. Yes he was a bit of a perv, and some of his work is a bit OUT there and for adults only, but all in all a very interesting way to while away a couple of hours - don't forget the restaurant for refreshments on your way out - beautiful views of the Ubud valley and gorgeous food - great for lunch or an afternoon dessert."

He was known by some as the \"Dali of Bali\" - but that's a massive insult to Dali. (And to Bali, for that matter.) There is nothing innovative, surrealistic, or thought-provoking of Blanco's work. It's a man who loved women, loved naked women, and loved painting naked women. And he crafted a few really inane collages that seemed like they were made by a teen-aged boy. The museum is his beautiful home and grounds, but really it's not worth paying the entrance fee for just that. You do get a welcome drink, which is nice. So that was probably the highlight."

The building is impressive and the view from the top is great. However, the art was \"old beatnik.\" Kinda lecherous and not in a sexy way, just pathetic. Lots of artsy fartsy collages and tacky 60s era paintings. If you go, you have got to see the photo of Antonio Blanco with his family. He's flourishing paintbrushes and has the most ridiculous \"I'm so full of myself\" pose. It's a laugh though I feel sorry for his family."

My husband wanted to go as we missed the opportunity last time we were in Ubud, so we made a special trip to it.I don't know why people complain about costs here in Ubud...50,000rp to get in? Big deal, it's only $5 bucks out of my wallet and I'd pay much more for the experience in Queensland being photographed with parrots. So, value for money it was ok and worth it just to have photos with the gorgeous parrots.The grounds are spectacular and the buildings amazing. The first thing you notice is the grand entrance that looks like some kind of twining serpent...except it's the artists signature in a stylised format. I didn't realise that the Blanco Museum was a monument to one person, I thought it was a collection of works by a person or the a 'white' building.So, we go through the doors and I'm gobsmacked at the overindulgent opulence of the place. And that's just the building...the artworks themselves are like being force fed fairy floss and then spun around at 100mph...it's dizzying seeing all of this over the top, mad-hatterish style framing and self aggrandising adornments on most of the work.I'm no fine artist, but I do know art, and Antonio's work is lovely and skilful, showing a unique style he made all his, yet to me, his fixation on the erotic and the over-endowment of his women, made the visit less than it could have been. Here was a talented man who found himself on a tropical island where all his european fantasies, fed from national geographics and Margaret Meade, came to life in the innocent balinese women.As I made my way through this 'mausoleum' of sex I noticed many of his works seemed to have the genitalia erased and darkened...wasn't sure about why, given the erotic nature of most of his works on display.Don't be mistaken, this is a man who was very talented and forsook the standard art school teachings to develop his own style, and his lifestyle may not have been to everyones taste, but he wasn't a fool when it came to monetising and cashing in on the people he met, mentors and his ability to work a canvas.As I went through the exhibition it was apparent to me that a number of pieces were mere reproductions - reproductions printed on canvas. I can buy this material and print my own reproductions, and I've seen this before, so I was deeply disappointed by this.Another thing that bothered me was the exiting of the building. I would have loved the opportunity to purchase some of the works in printed reproductions, but there was nothing available like this. Most 'museums' have this, so it was a lack I felt keenly...something light to take home as a memory in my luggage or to send to friends would have been very good. We were directed to the studio and then we went through some other buildings...and then we exited into the carpark and had to re-enter the facility again in order to get to the restaurant.Would I go again or take anyone there? No.Would a serious artist be interested? I don't think so.Would I recommend this to a visitor? No, I don't think so.Was it expensive? NoDid I get something for my money? Yes - pictures with gorgeous parrots.There is a very steep climb with no stairs to get to the museum, and it's not pram or disabled friendly in any way.The restaurant has a lovely menu, and considering the range of prices in Ubud, is mid range. $9 approx for a main meal. It's not pretentious, and has great bathroom facilities. They give you a lovely caramel coffee iced drink after your visit which is delightfully refreshing. I'd go back to the restaurant for a meal, but they are desperate for customers and will push you for a booking/reservation."

The grounds are huge, as are the buildings, and it's all quite random, starting with the (very friendly) parrots just outside the main building and ending with odd things the museum has preserved from the artist's life.The art collection displayed is large enough, and that will give you a good overview of Blanco's works (although I've heard dark rumours that many are fakes, simple prints touched up with paint, practice pieces done by his students and signed after his death etc). They also display pieces from Antonio's son, Mario.Most of it isn't really to my liking, and the lighting was a bit poor in places, but a few pieces were very striking. Whether you like it or not, it's worth going in for a wander, but at Rps 50,000 it doesn't come cheap."

(which is apparently a sign of stress)Since this breed is critically endangered it was somewhat upsetting to see these birds not being cared for adequately. Two emails have been sent to the Blanco Museum via their own website over the past 4 weeks to gently bring this issue to the powers that be, but we have had no response. Please I strongly urge you to not visit this museum. Julie and Steven Smith Melbourne Victoria"

I walked up to the Blanco Museum from my hotel and was really hot and sweaty by the time I'd climbed up the steep hill in the Bali humid heat. I paid my entrance fee of 50000 rupiah (About \u00a33) and then was directed to the restaurant for my complimentary welcome drink which was ice cool and much appreciated. What I appreciated a whole lot more was the lovely cool towel that the waiter gave me.I walked around the Blanco museum and he's clearly very odd, very close/friendly to Michael Jackson and obsessed with erotica, but I really enjoyed his art. The building in which the gallery was based was beautiful Lots of very dark colours and gold, it should have looked horrendously tacky, but it was actually really intriguing and appealing. His artwork was a lot of very detailed oil paintings, but also lots of collage work interspersed with writings and poetry that he had written. I wasn't sure when I went up to the second floor of the gallery whether I should go up onto the roof using the slightly rickety spiral staircase, but I did anyway and the view was fantastic - jungle and rice fields. The gardens in which the museum and gallery is set are pretty spectacular too, there are loads of vividly coloured parrots on perches which if you like you can have put on your shoulder. I didn't really fancy this, but I did take a couple of pictures. I then ventured into the gift shop via a place where they had a DVD playing depicting a dodgy acting out of Blanco courting his Balinese dancer wife and bought the \"Fabulous Blanco\" book getting a bit confused by the conversion price again. (I paid 1 million rupiah about \u00a360 and had buyers remorse, but then from my research online it is selling in some places for \u00a3500 or isn't available at all, so I felt a little happier!) This was such an unusual art gallery and I really enjoyed his work and I would definitely recommend it as excellent value for money."

He had it built on the grounds of his villa, and the personal touch shows. Blanco is called \"The Dali of Bali\" because of his supposedly eccentricities, and certain of his artwork shows the same sense of humor. His style is nothing at all like Dali's, though, and some of the rest is pretty run-of-the-mill, but several of his portraits are just magic. He's more impressionistic than surrealistic, and had a Picasso-esque fascination with erotica.This museum is a great example of why there ought to be more small museums just like this: it's got a vibe all its own, and is clearly a work of passion. Oddly, my favorite things about the museum are NOT the art: it's the lovely grounds, the friendly and informative staff, the tame birds (including a magnificent hornbill) that perch on your shoulder, and Blanco's studio. The main gallery of his work is small enough to not be overwhelming, even though it's all one artist's work. Honestly, it feels like you're visiting your your very wealthy friend's house for a garden party.Plus, one of Bali's best restaurants, The Bridges, is just next door, so you can spend a tranquil hour or two here just before dusk, and then setts in for a great meal!"

If you are into art then a visit to this museum is a must to complete your museum experience in Ubud Bali.Born of Spanish parents in Manila and married to a Balinese dancer, Blanco likened himself to Salvidore Dali, though his paintings do not bear much resemblance to those of the Spanish painter. The museum, which was designed and built by Blanco himself, is set in superb grounds and housed in an unique building whose entrance is designed from his signature. The superb collection will either impress or disgust, but either way, it is an amazing tribute to this outrageous artist and his personality is reflected not only in his sensual paintings but also in the poetry, visual riddles and puns incorporated in some of his paintings. Each frame is a work of art in itself and visitors are able to visit the workshop where he created his work."

I\u2019d never heard of Antonio Blanco before, but he\u2019s known as the Dali of Bali and the site contains a neo-baroque museum, small gallery, and the studio where he used to paint, including all his paints, brushes and half-finished canvases seemingly undisturbed in the 12 years since he died. The garden is fabulous, with many different kinds of tropical birds in residence, including toucans, parrots, cockatoos and a type of small buzzard. The museum building, which one enters through a gigantic sculpted rendition of the maestro\u2019s signature (apparently renowned as the world\u2019s largest signature), is in questionable taste, with golden statues of women gracing the terraces and rooftop, and two floors of Antonio\u2019s paintings, collages and drawings of women, clothed and (mostly) unclothed, all in his own especially designed wooden frames (one featuring an effigy of ET). His portraits are skillful but seriously kitschy! .A museum attendant opened two \"special frames\" for us to show us the extent of Blanco's romantic vision ... If you visit this museum in the right frame of mind, you'll likely enjoy it; if you go expecting a serious renaissance artist, you will be disappointed.

My journey started by being greeted by the most amazing and exotic birds, they were big, colorful and friendly, one tried to chew off my watch in a friendly kind of way when he was on my arm.The paintings are housed in this amazing renaissance dome hall, each and every painting had it's own bespoke frame that matches the artwork all designed with the artist's great sense of humour and love for women. I am amazed this place actually exist in Ubud and someone living such a colorful life here. After admiring the paintings, i visited the artist's actual studio where he created these wonderful work. My journey ended with admiring his son's work, another great artist. This trip was totally unexpected as my impression of Ubud was very traditional and conservative. A must visit attraction when you are in Ubud."

From the moment we walked through the entrance we were captivated by the beautiful gardens and exotic birds. The actual museum building and artwork is spectacular. The artwork tells a fascinating story of the Artists life and his loves. A wonderful surprise ?"

            "review": "Astonishing and impressive. Antonio Blanco was given this magnificent piece of land by the King of Ubud and later knighted by the King of Spain, so he is probably permitted a bit of ego. The grounds alone are worth the admission price (still Rp 50000) and you are greeted with a cooling drink. The museum is an amazing building, maybe a little bit of Barcelona in Ubud, and the artwork is mostly focused on women and mild erotica, and displayed in beautiful and outrageous frames made by Blanco. The family still lives on the site, and the next geneation, in Marco Blanco, is also very talented."

First, the good stuff - the grounds are beautiful, the museum building is lovely with bold colours, twisting staircases, and epic views from the top. It is worth it to visit just for the beauty of this building.That said, I have no taste for the art of Blanco - I found it tacky. It seems to me that the artist was obsessed with sexualising women. His poems are not to my taste either. I have had friends recommend this place to me so I am sure many people appreciate his works. I don't want to criticise, I guess it was just not for me. Maybe you will love it."

I don't know where any comparisons to Dali have come from. To call this place bizarre or weird indicates that it might be quirky or interesting. The best thing about this visit was the exotic birds, but I don't even know if the birds enjoy being placed on tourists over and over again for photo ops. I wish I had taken my 50,000 IDR and gotten a spa treatment instead."

A rich guy with a strange sense of 'art' comes to Bali with a lot of money and shamelessly builds a 'museum' to agrandize his own pathetic works. A cheesy sign part way up the hill even welcomes you to 'The Blanco Dynasty'. Once we realized the world we had naively entered we turned around and left, wishing we had not paid the entrance fee. The land could be better used by razing the buildings (and the so called art) and building a park for the indonesian people. The Puri is much better. Skip this tourist trap and continue enjoying Bali any other way possible."

The paintings are interesting and often extend beyond the canvas onto the frames which are also works of art themselves. Although children may not be interested in the paintings so much, the grounds and wildlife would probably of interest."

As someone heavily involved in the arts, I was excited to see the collection and the buildings. I was, however, horrified to discover how birds are being treated on you property.In a very dark and humid basement, lit only by one faint lightbulb, and smelling of decomposing feces, I saw five cages containing tropical birds. The cages were on the ground. There was no evidence of food. The smell of feces was overwhelming. Two cages in particular, were stored in the back of the basement, completely in the dark and hard to reach. The whole incident - which I have fotographed for evidence - broke my heart.I went around the propertly looking for someone who could explain what was going on. Two employees told me they were there \"to be fed.\" This, of course, was a blatant lie. Birds are not placed in feces-ridden, humid, dark rooms in order to eat. A third employee (who spoke better English) told a different story. She said they were there because they were \"still a bit wild\" and that the museum staff \"was teaching them how to behave\" by putting them in that room. Voila.My visit was ruined by this terrible sight. It is a disgrace to have animal abuse take place on its grounds. Sincerely,Adriana Kertzer, Esq."

Hmm, I know this is going to sound completely jerky but unlike all the other reviewers of this museum, I just couldn't really get into this place at all. I mean, I am usually someone who can appreciate any and all flavors of creativity (long as it merits it, of course, I live in New Orleans after all) but to me it just seemed like this guy, Antonio Blanco, ie the Maestro, loved himself so much he turned his home into a private museum to honor himself. So now anyone can pay to glimpse his genus. My favorite thing here was the coffee drink they give you at the entrance and the parrots but whatever, I say, it takes all kinds to color up this world from Jane Austin to Kim Kardashian to Michael Vick or Jeff Bridges, right? (also, my father is an art museum director so this might have something to do with my innoculation against the Maestro) By the way, the first big thing that confronts you at the top of the sweeping stairs is a humungous sculpture of what, you ask? his signature...before you even see what he's done to warrant what he claims to be the world's biggest signature! Wow, that says it all. I have added the picture below for your peasure.And yet how can we not have heard of him before? Move over Handcock..I think we need to start referencing people's \"Antonio Blanco\" next time we need to ask for someone's signature. The posing with Michael Jackson at the very end of the tour says more than I ever could.Anyway, don't feel like you have to waste your money here just to do something 'cultural' in Ubud-- go to the other museum just across the bridge (still in Ubud) The Neka, this place is awesome and actually less money for a whole lot more bang! Lots of cool weapons on display too! And if you like impressionism or even post imp. you will fall in love with some of these artists. (Think Paul Gauguin if he had gone to Bali instead of Tahiti.)"

Pros: You get to see and understand how Antonio \"initially a foreigner\" gets married to a Balinese dancer and then works to combine Western and Eastern elements in art and life.Cons: None really. Be open minded I guess. Tip: Perhaps more suitable for adults - check out his \"erotic\" art pieces with an open mind and in the name of art :)"

This is a little paradise that one man created and while the unusual art wont be to everyone's taste, the grounds, the exotic birdlife that has been gathered there and the view from the roof top of the gallery are well worth the minor entry charge. Great for a mid morning, pre lunch visit."

            "review": "Enjoyed the art but have give a safety alert. We visited Blanco Museum last week and we both enjoyed the art of the Blanco family, very creative and the framing is amazing. The grounds and building well worth visiting. However the lighting inside is quite dim and the dark green marble floor and some steps are a trap. My husband nearly fell, it is really hard to see the steps, there are no white strips on them to show that there is a step there. He was lucky and was able to recover himself and did not go down. I wasn't so lucky, we went upstairsto the first floor, to see more paintings and I came down again, so carefully holding onto the handrail, the majority of the steps are lighter in colour, then the hand rail ends and there are two dark green steps before the dark green floor, I suddenly found myself flat on the floor. In the dim light I did not see the two steps. I have a badly bruised left elbow and right hand, a very badly bruised right knee and just found out today I have a cracked knee cap. No wonder my knee was so sore and stiff. I now have 6 weeks with a knee splint and hopefully it will mend, I am lucky it could have been much worse.So please enjoy the art and surrounds but be very careful on the stairs."

            "review": "Erotisist and egotist, Blanco is fun. I visited this place some decades ago. Now that I am older I can relax and move beyond Antonio Blanco's outrageous egotism. Entry is Rs 50,000 and I received a nice iced coffee before enjoying the beautiful pet parrots from around the world. The gallery is an impressive and enjoyable building and a large collection of Blanco's paintings are well housed here. I would call it baroque rather than renaissance, but Blanco actually was a good painter despite his obvious intention to be the Dali of Bali. Relax and enjoy the fantasy but be sure to also visit the three important art museums in Ubud; the Neka Art Museum (not Neka Gallery), the Museum Puri Lukisan and Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA)."

What an amazing experience - was totally unprepared for the beauty of the museum - we met Mrs Blanco (a celebrated dancer Ni Ronji) at the front gate and later in the gardens - what a gracious woman. Our 9 year old daughter was fascinated by the works - we will visit again - take the time to take it all in - wonderful grounds and helpful staff - willing to talk about the artist, son Mario and his paintings - it was my favourite part of our Ubud holiday."

The museum houses the work of Don Antonio Blanco, its a fairly new building and the entrance is just breathtaking. His studio was built in 1952 it is part of the museum, where today his son Mario still paints. This area is part of the Blanco home. The family temple, a small Amphitheater and a gift shop is all part of the beautiful compound. Don Antonio, born in Manila, lived in Spain and moved to Bali in 1952. He is often called the\"The Dali of Bali\". Its a stop you have to make.Price is about $5."
