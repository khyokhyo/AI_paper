It was not far from our hotel, the bridge is beautiful and you could cross it ( right not they have some construction work to fix the road so it's a little noisy but no cars drive there) At night it's slightly purple - very nice to seeThere's an army ship you could see between tower bridge and London bridge but I'm not quite sure what's the story about it"

The Tower Bridge is undoubtedly the most famous bridge in the world and has its own little museum packed with interesting information on its history.The tour started with a lift ride to the top where it showcases how it is built and the milestones it has been through. You will get to walk across the 2 glass bridges on top of the bridge where you have good views over the Thames. Part of the bridge comes with glass floor which can be scary for some!Also, visit the engines rooms!"

The admission fee is not as high as other city attractions and we managed to get 20% discount by showing a qualifying London printed map to the attendant. The bridge is right next to The Tower of London and has a nice view over the river Thames from both sides - east and west. There is a glass floor on the upper bridge section allowing you to view the traffic below. There are also ceiling mirrors for quirky selfies. We used a vending machine that takes photos of you and your beloved or family, and pasting them on a postcard template with professional images of the bridge. I guess these would make a good memento in any family album. It is not cheap (I think we paid 10 pounds for 4 different postcards) but nothing in London is!After the bridge, you are taken to the boiler room which is on the south side of the river, where, the now redundant machinery powering the bridge is on display."

I have visited the bridge several times and it never fails to impress. This time we visited the museum and also experienced walking over the Thames River via the glass floor high up the bridge. The museum is fascinating and explains the history of the bridge, its design and its operation. The views from the top are breath taking (maybe it had something to do with the glass floor). When we were in the museum we were told that Tower Bridge was soon to be closed to traffic for the resurfacing of its bascules. However we were also told that visitors to Tower Bridge Exhibition will still be able to go inside and enjoy all the exhibition has to offer."

We were lucky enough to be on the walkway, when the bascules or leaves, were raised to allow river traffic to pass. Towers are 213 ft, standing on the glass, looking down between your feet, is surrealistic. Probably not for you, if problem with heights. Nice views, in all directions. One interesting note, German pilots never bombed the bridge in WWII, as they used it for a point of reference, when bombing London, and other points in England. Lots of informative historical info boards, all the the bridge, a good tour if you want to see how the bascules worked then (early 1800's), and now. Would highly recommend, if your sightseeing, in London."

You get up to the upper part of the bridge via a lift, at each end is a video showing various aspects of the bridge & its life. There is a glass section of the floor on both sods of the bridge, each one is about 11m long & it's well worth trying to walk over it. The view out of the windows on both sides of the bridge are pretty spectacular when we were there, there was a super yacht moored up & also we saw a double rainbow over Canary Wharf. But the bet bit of the whole trip was to be there when the bridge was raised to allow the iconic paddle steamer The Waverley underneath, after a brief turnaround it went back under the bridge again, so it had been raised twice in the time we were up there.A fantastic experience & great value for money, part of the impact is going to be lessened as the bridge is going to permanently open for a while to allow works to be carried out, but it is still spectacular."

The glass floor section is a nice addition, but understandable that it can make people queezy. You can see right down to the river and all the people cats and boats passing underneath you. A nice touch, if your not too sure of the history of the place is the big screen inside one of the coloums where you can watch a brief documentary about how the bridge was made. The type of the bridge has the history in pictures and with the faces of the men behind it, along with other images of famous bridges around the world. A nice day out for everyone"

Inevitably, one of the first things we went to was the Tower Bridge. It was a warm and sunny morning, but the light was not right for taking pictures. So we walked along the length of the river till we came to the road and crossed over to the other side. It was perfect. Following the facelift of 2012, it is bright and gleamed in the sunlight. The jetty a little ahead takes one by the riverside; from here the Bridge literally towered over our heads. Built in between 1886 and 1894 across the Thames, it opens up to let ships pass through it and is most certainly the iconic symbol of London. With the Tower of London behind us and the Tower Bridge in front, the setting was remarkable, to say the least."

From there is a beautiful stroll on the east side towards the south side. Views are amazing. West side is also available to walk across. Partially glass floor is a lovely feature. History of the bridge and world bridge engineering is very nicely displayed. Descend is several flights of stairs on the south side to shop level and then with the lift to the bottom. Very dissapointing, the engine workshop was not open and no one informed us about this."

I think the confusion is a great conversation starter and by the time one finishes with London : you may hear it some 100 times. But then does it really matter :).? The Tower Bridge it's self is pretty majestic and awesome. We actually took a long walk over and around the bridge in the evening (best way to take in the magnificent views around it). I enjoy thinking of all the different types of carriages which moved over it over the years. Has some great hues once the lights come out at night. I would recommend the long walk to the millennium bridge (both of them imprinted thanks to Harry Potter films). Fuel your self up around the Tower of London : some good eating spots there and places to capture a digital image too :)"

The construction itself is very impressive - check the Tower Bridge museum to learn about the details - and, if you're lucky, you will witness when it is opening for big ships to pass through which is stunning considering it is opened hydraulically up to an angle of 86 degrees.Make sure to take pictures of the bridge from different angles - from the Tower, from Southwark/Bermondsey side of the Themse, from St. Paul's Cathedral (outside the dome), from London Eye...If you're there at opening time, be creative in taking funny pictures (holding down, pushing up); if it is closed and open for traffic and pedestrians, make sure to walk over to the other side and take pictures from ON the bridge (find the best angle to catch the Tower and maybe the Gherkin and/or St. Paul's Cathedral in 1 picture).Best to be combined with a visit to the Tower and great at any time of the day as there is always something interesting to see around Tower Bridge. Enjoy!"

We visited Tower Bridge on a crazy weather day, with rain, hail and sleet forcing us to wait about 20 minutes in Dead Man's Hole (at the bottom of the bridge) before we could go up. Luckily the weather cleared, as there wouldn't be much point going up there if it was raining. We enjoyed walking along the length of the bridge, looking through the clear glass to the road, and taking in the nice view. There are small windows along the length of the bridge that open for photos, but it would be tricky if it was raining. We weren't all that interested in the text panels that talked about different bridges around the world. We then had a quick look at the pump room, but didn't linger long. I think the price is a little high for the amount of time spent here, and the amount of things to do. Glad we have done it once though."

Personally I felt the start/finish videos were a bit disappointing but there are some more interesting ones on the walkway which provide background on history. Also some good views of London and an interesting perspective from the glass floors. Engine room worth a visit."

We were part of a coach group and were given our tickets and the option of either waiting in line to get the lift, or we could go straight in and go up the stairs, without really thinking about it we opted for walking up the stairs. If you are in the same position, beware ... its a long long way up! Worth it though. On the way down, we got the lift and also visited the engine rooms, which are accessed over the bridge at road level and included in your entrance fee. Very good value for \u00a39.00 per adult."

It's relatively cheap to get in and you get some fantastic views of London from up there. There is a lot of interesting information about the bridge and it has got some great history from its building and during WW2Definitely worth visiting while there and you can combine the Tower of London easily in the same day.It is an attraction you can do on a rainy day, although the views out may not be as good."

If timed well (like we did) you get to watch the drawbridge go up and the ships pass from the top through the glass bottom surface . Not for someone who is afraid of heights. Great views of the tower of london, the financial district , the Thames. You also get to visit the engine rooms and see how the drawbridge operates.

I love London & everything in it, I only live 20 odd miles away and visit all the time as there is so much to do there. I think as soon as you see Tower Bridge, you know you REALLY are in London. Such an iconic sight. I've seen it a billion times but never really knew you could go up it!! Go on to their website and book a ticket, it was only about \u00a38 and it was valid for a year. I went with my daughter in August and only had to queue for about 5 minutes. The glass walk way freaked me out a bit :) but as there were children jumping up and down on it and 3 grown up (slightly largish) men standing on it I thought I would be pretty safe. The views are amazing, as always. I'm so glad I've been up there now."

If you check out their website timetable before hand you can plan your visit around the lifting of the bridge, happens a couple of times a day I think.

It doesn't matter day or night, I just like it here very much, my hubby and I enjoyed the walk here. it was really beautiful and romantic.The bascules are still open time to time, since it bridge is the a very busy crossing. The bascules only raised for the limited number of times, if you want to see that, better check out their time table online. We were quite lucky that was able to saw it during our walks. I didn't realize that was a thing till the tour guide on the boat tour told us that. It was quite a sight. Right, there are also many boat tour services around. I tried the London Eye River Cruise, quite nice one. It is another cool experience to see the city on the river Thamse, especially when the weather is great."

The bridge itself is absolutely a stunning piece of architecture, and with the option to now cross the top of it if you want to pay I can't imagine the photos you could get! Standing in the middle of a crosswalk on either side of the bridge in a pedestrian path that is safe gets some of the coolest photos. And waiting around for a double decker red bus is absolutely worth it."

On our previous visit we could not fit in touring the Tower Bridge much to my daughters disappointment, so this time it was a must. And am I glad we did. The Tower Bridge is of course an iconic part of what makes London. Walking across it and looking up and around is already awe inspiring, but taking the tour takes it to a whole new level.You start off exploring the older exhibitions of the technology that once powered the raising of the bridge. Truly amazing the ingenuity that is on display. You then climb to the upper structure where you can enjoy spectacular views of London. The glass floor is not for faint of heart but if you can steel yourself to stand on it, it is quite the experience. Tip, wait for a boat to pass beneath the bridge and point your phone at the mirror on the ceiling, capturing a unique picture of yourself seeming to float above the river below.Take some time to look at the pictures of the many other examples of truly wonderful bridge architecture the world over. There are numerous stands where you can watch historic videos of the bridge. I was fascinated to learn that the Luftwaffe deliberately avoided targeting the bridge, electing instead to use it as a navigation beacon.If you don't have the time or money, enjoy the bridge from the banks of the Thames, but if you have the time, it is well worth it. We went there on a very hot day, might be best to avoid days like this as it is quite crowded and hot."

There's also a short 4minute video that explains how the bridge was constructed, cost and duration which is really interesting.For me, to really see the bridge in all its glory, it's worth walking down to the embankment; this is where you really notice the beauty of tower bridge."

Having lived in London last summer we didn't think we could top all the things we did...until this. We saw people last year walking out of the tower bridge door so I investigated. Lots of history and informative things to read for those who can and want to get also just looking through the clear floor below was awesome for the younger kids. Check out the schedule for the bridge opening times before heading there. I think the tour takes about one hour with two little videos. Afterwards go down to the room to see how the engines and machines work. Note that this can get very warm. We also had to take the stairs down from the bridge as the elevator wasn't working so we were a little hot. Of course the tour ends in the gift shop, which the items are nice and a little different. I only gave 4 stars as I would have liked the videos to be a little more in depth. It was sum what crowded too so maybe go on s day when you don't feel rushed to read all the fact signs up on the top of the bridge"

We visited after exploring the Tower of London and the ticket office is on the Tower side of the Thames. We had a two for one ticket offer because we travelled to London by train, so felt this was good value for money. You can choose to take the lift up to the upper walkways - but if you're able I'd suggest taking the stairs at a steady pace, since you get to see more of the inside architecture - and there is a rest landing halfway up! The glass floor on the upper walkways is very popular and you have to virtually walk across people laid out taking photos! This could be a real pain at busy times. The glass floors could be a little unsettling for anyone uneasy with heights, but you can just about skirt round the outside of the glass floor. The view from the upper walkways is fab - it was a lovely sunny day when we visited so could see quite far down the river. There's lots of photos and info about other famous bridges on display, which makes for an interesting read. And there's obviously information on the Tower Bridge history. It seems the bridge only raises on average about 3 times a week - so you'd have to be lucky to catch that. There is a screen at the end of one of the walkways, which gives you the times of the next scheduled bridge opening, so you could always plan to come back and watch from the riverside, if you're still in London. Ticket price, also includes admission to the engine room. Unless you're interested in machinery and such like it's probably not that exciting, but you have to admire the remarkable feat of engineering that was used to raise the bridge before technology took over! Overall the Tower Bridge is definitely worth a visit - kids will love the glass floor!"

Driving over it doesn't do it justice as you have to feel the the bridge as a double decker passes over the middle. One of London's major tourist attraction and has to be seen."

Maybe if you buy tickets in advance it would be much better but there was a long line to buy tickets. Once we realized one cashier(there were three) was just sitting there avoiding eye contact not calling for the next person to come up. No one was going up to him so we just walked right up and helped us right away.After the ticket line, you can wait in line for the elevator or take the stairs. The elevator looked at least like a 15min wait so we took the stairs. It is neat inside and the glass walkway is fun just not sure it was worth $12. So if you have time and money go for it. I think teens would enjoy the snapability of the glass floors. If you are limited in time I would maybe suggest something else."

There is also a glass floor for those who are willing to brave it (well worth it though IMO).There is a lot about the history of the bridge which was great as we didn't know a lot about it. Allow around 45 minutes (give or take) for the Tower Bridge.We caught the tube to Tower Hill station and it is only a 5-10 minute walk to the bridge. It is also well sign posted so look out for the signs.The Tower of London is right next to it so if you plan on doing both on your London visit, schedule them in for the same day (allow around 3 hours).Also the Shard building is about a 10-15 minute walk if you are interested in going up 310m to view a 40 mile, 360 degree view of London (allow around 45 minutes). You can also get some great photos, and there are lot's of caf\u00e9s on the walk to the Shard.

There is a glass floor walkway in the upper tower so you can look down at the cars beneath you and the engine room has detail panels on how the bridge was built and how the original steam boilers worked. Great for kids and adults alike. But maybe not if you a thing for heights."

The very first time I saw the Tower Bridge I was amazed to see the view and this beautiful structure a true iconic and symbol of London. This place brings a sparkle in my eyes and new hopes to keep dreaming of new places. We also got an opportunity to walk through the glass ceiling through student discount on the entry fare. But the price is worth the view. I really enjoy every moment spend near London bridge. I wish soon I can visit this place again. I would recommend a visit to this place."

This is something that cannot be made right and was totally unnecessary they could have been completely out of the boughs and caused no harm but big money has robed the world of what was London just so the elite few can have the Tower Bridge as their dining room back drop."

As a bonus our visit managed to coincide with the bridge actually going up whilst we were there, and we could see this from above, through the glass floor. As we'd travelled by train we manged to get two for one entry (with voucher from stations)"

It's a lot of fun but if you're scared of heights make sure to avoid the glass panels in the bridge's floor (you can easily walk around them). You get a good but not great view of London seeing as parts of the windows are obstructed by the bridge's support system. We would still recommend it! It's great fun!"

One lady was constantly keeping a 2m square area clear of other people for her selfies of which she proceeded to take at least 30!!

They obviously loved the glass floor and although the bridge didn't raise we had an amazing experience. Walking so high above the traffic below showed a very unique view of the city.The history behind the bridge is equally as amazing. Seeing how the bridge was constructed and built was riveting :) (pun intended).Sailing under the bridge is also a great experience, especially on the city cruises with open top boats.The only downside is that the engine rooms felt like a little bit of an after thought and we would have liked to have seen more information. My 6 year old was a little frustrated but he loved the two hands on experiments at the end. As an improver to this fantastic experience I would have more people in the engine rooms (we saw no one working there at all) and more hands on experiments.Amazing experience and very highly recommended for any visitor to London."

Bit of a queue to wait for the lift to go up to the tower but we did not fancy climbing up 206 steps, once up the top we walked across the north tower to the south tower, this walk included the glass walk way which was brilliant, its only a small area to walk across compared to the whole walkway area, you can also walk around it and not look down if you are not a fan of heights. The views from the walkway of London are brilliant, was quite busy around the glass part of the walkway as everyone wants photos on the glass, but the crowd does die down and you can get your photos done, you can walk across the other side walkway (south to north) they also have a glass bit and views of the other side of London from the bridge. Once you have finished with this part you can walk along the bridge following the blue line to the engine room part of the bridge, make sure you keep your tickets handy as you need them to get into this part as well, definetely recommend this experience but just walking across the bridge itself is a great thing to do."

It's because of the beautiful towers, that this bridge is so iconic. With the London Pass you can skip the waiting line, which saves you a lot of time. The tour through the bridge, gives you a good impression about how it was build and how the bridge functions. The new glass floor is very cool. It offers very nice new perspectives to take a picture. A nice innovation in a centuries old bridge."

Actually lot of people took tower Bridge as tower of London but the bridge shown in the most of the London promos and pictures is tower Bridge and not London Bridge. You can see very good view of river Thames from tower Bridge. Apart from photography you can find very green garden on the east end of the tower Bridge to chill out and London tower on the west side of the tower Bridge. This attraction is very close to Tower Hill train station, so ads convenience to your visit. I suggest to visit this place early in the first half of the DAY so you can cover both London tower and tower Bridge."

Great staff and all very interesting and well displayed.When we got to the tower entrance on the bridge it was very busy but the queue moved very quickly. We decided to walk up as the queue for the lift was very long and we are so pleased that we did because it was lovely to see the views from the windows as we went up and got a feel for the history.The staff were really friendly and helpful again as we got to the glass walkway. My son was a bit nervous while the rest of us were busy taking photos while we were on the glass and a staff member reassured him and encouraged him and before you know it we managed to get a photo of all 6 of us on there. The kids even jumped!Great staff, great value for our family and great fun!"

This doesn't happen too often as the boat obviously needs prior special permission for the bridge to open. One thing you must try is the tower Bridge exhibition whist you are there.

I wanted something we could fit in, that wouldn't cost a lot or really need a full or half day to make the most of. This was perfect.We arrived early, joining a queue before it actually opened. But this proved to be helpful. The kids took a wee bit of interest in the first video and exhibit, but were more interested in getting onto the glass floor. We went out and they had lots of fun, though it is not a huge area and lots of people, even first thing want photos. The kids moved on to the end of the corridor and I asked the assistant if we were able to go back along the other corridor - for some reason no-one else had entered that corridor so we were on our own for a while. This gave us more time to enjoy the glass floor. If you lay down, there is a mirror on the ceiling so you see yourself on top of the glass floor and the Thames underneath. Lots of fun.There are other parts to the exhibit as well which are interesting, and a video showing how it has changed over the years. Worth a visit. They also do family tickets in a range of sizes, though we used the National Rail 2for1 deal."

What is cool is that they were at the leading forefront in the technology to raise and lower a bridge back when they built it. Now.. It is just another bridge that people hurry across and the hoards of people detract from the overall experience. Would I do the tour again? No, probably not. More than anything it is just a photo shoot for the tourists who get in the way of the people who just want to cross it."

We viewed it on the BigBus tour and by boat on the Thames, but the best experience without a doubt was actually walking over the bridge, starting on the Tower of London side. The photos I took of the bridge and the Thames were magnificent. Enjoy the views of ancient structures holding their ground at the river's edge as sky-scraping modern buildings peak up behind them. The park at the other side of the bridge is just the right spot to sit and place back on this beauty of a bridge."

Great opportunity for photos, and when you look across through the windows some great views!Then you walk over to the other walkway with great views of London looking at the Tower of London, HMS Belfast, St Pauls Cathedral to mention a few, they also have another section of a glass floor, which also has a mirror above for more fun photos, and we got lucky because the bridge opened beneath us for a boat to go through.Then once you have finished its down the stairs or lift and walk to the other side of the bridge to see the old engine room with steam engines and the history that goes with it.It's all well worth the visit and at the price of less than \u00a310.00 each it is a great valued trip with great views and learning about this wonderful bridge."

Had booked tickets online which is a little less than buying on the day, also children discount is valid up to age 16. You can take the elevator or go up the stairs (which we did, already interesting part of the building and not crowded) to the walkways above the bridge. Obviously not of interest to people with height issues. Parts of the walkways feature glass floor which makes for a special experience and cool pictures. Featured alongside are info boards on other spectacular and/or famous bridges around the world and there's also TVs with information narrated by one of the current engineers, subtitles available in different languages. Great views across London, even though our visit was on a cloudy day. The engine rooms on the south side are fascinating as well - even if you're not tech-minded, be amazed by the sparkly cleanness of the machines ;)Really great visit and not as expensive as most other London attractions (our family ticket was \u00a314.10 for one adult and two 15 year old)."

The glass floor while being so high up on the bridge is a very unique feature. We got the London Pass and this was one of the places we were able to get in without standing in line. If you take the stairs (and there are a lot of them) your experience will begin much faster than standing in the long lift lines."

The tour is self-guided so you can take as much or as little time as you want. First you will see the inner workers of the bridge mechanism including a short film about the construction and operation of it. After that you can go up on the upper walkway high above the street below. This part of the tour is worth the admission price alone. Some terrific photo opportunities from that vantage point including through the glass floor you walk along which I must say takes a little getting used to and a bit of faith. I have been to London many times but this was my first closeup encounter with this magnificent structure. A must do if you love London, By the way, the staff very friendly and helpful especially the staff in the very good gift shop which was very busy."

The very kind lad on reception rang through nothing had been found but gave us a couple of tickets to go look ourselves.

For children there is a sticker if you manage to hold your stomach and brave standing on the glass floor.

Both east & west walkways are bascially the same with information boards along the path & also a glass floor which can be scary for some people as you can see the pavement, road & Thames below - some visitors were laying on the glass taking selfies. The views are good from the sides & after doing both walkways you can view a 4 minute video on the history/building of the bridge before taking a lift back down to the ground to follow a blue line along the pavement outside to the engine rooms & the inevitable souvenir shop.It was interesting but not stimulating, but glad we visited"

The displays are quite interesting and very educational. You learn how the bridge operated \"back in the day\". Even though I enjoyed the exhibits, my husband was really in awe. We both recommend a visit to the Tower Bridge for anyone of all ages. But FYI: there are a ton of stairs to climb and we do not recall if there was an elevator available or not. So this attraction may not be handi-cap accessible.Visited August 2009"

You can walk across it at road level for free. If you take a Thames River cruise, you can travel under it. So, what does the Tower Bridge Exhibition buy you for \u00a39?Well...Mainly, it's the high-level walkways with the glass floors. You do get to see the old steam engines and an explanation on how the bridge works. But, mainly it's the glass floors in the walkways. They have mirrors on the ceilings of the walkways so you can lie down on glass floors and take photos. The views from the walkways are spectacular as well. But, is it worth \u00a39? No.But, no one pays \u00a39.If you visit the Tower of London using the London Pass, it's almost automatic to go to the Exhibition (which is included) and probably HMS Belfast and/or the tour of the Globe Theatre. National Rail 2FOR1 also has an offer for the Exhibition. Even the Exhibition's own website has advanced tickets for \u00a38 with discounts for Families, Seniors and joint tickets for The Monument and can be purchased as eTickets via your smartphone. There are probably other offers out there as well. The point is don't pay \u00a39."

When walking the glass floor, don't forget to look out to the London skyline on both sides. There are a few \"little\" openings for you to take photos without shooting it through the glass windows. Apart from walking the glass floor, the pump room is probably worthy of a look if you are into engineering operating system. Another suggestion is to group Tower Bridge and Tower Of London together on a single day, and possibly squeeze in Borough Market. Highly recommend to visitors of London."

They will have no idea what is coming next.... At the very last corner, you turn, and there is Tower Bridge right in in front of you.This will be breathtaking enough, but if you have timed your visit well, your visitors will see the lights flashing, horns blaring, traffic stopping, and the 2 awesome sections lifting majestically into the air.I live here, and have done this many times, and it still takes my breath away.Enjoy!(of course, there are specific attractions on and up the bridge, but someone else can review them!)"

Evidently, much of the structure was repeatedly altered over the years so it was hard to tell what might have truly been original. I guess my biggest turnoff was listening to the Yeoman Warder's presentation about Ann Bolyn's beheading. He was cracking jokes which felt very disrespectful. The site was a place of much cruelty and selfish manipulation by those seeking power and turning it into a Disney-like attraction doesn't seem appropriate."

Then walk across the sky walkways and enjoy great views of the London skyline as well as the glass bottom sections. You'll also see pictures and info on other famous bridges found around the world. Can't get enough Tower Bridge knowledge? Then find a spot to sit (or most likely stand) in tower 2 and enjoy another video that describes in great detail how the bridge was constructed. Once your learning center is full, head down the stairs and outside tower 2 following the marked path to the Tower Bridge Engine Room. These things are both massive and impressive to see. Once you've got your pictures, exit through the gift shop. #Tabestravels TOP TIP: The WC in the engine room is nice and clean. Should nature call, this is as good a place as any to answer."

Perhaps more interactive exhibits could be installed to eradicate this issue?Overall, it's worth the ticket price if you book in advance as you get stunning views of the London skyline."

Tower Bridge is one of the most famous bridges, and a trip to this historic landmark is well worth it.We had a 2 for 1 ticket from our local rail company which reduced the price.Queuing to get into the attraction is a tight squeeze, but once inside there is a choice of climbing the steps or going in the lift. We opted for the stairs (not too many of them), and saw plenty of exhibits along the way.You can walk along the platform where halfway across is a glass floor - the views onto the road and river are amazing. Well worth a visit!"

All the better if it is timed with a boat passing through and the bridge opening.I recall many a year ago when the bridge opened at 12 midnight and I was in a Taxi . We enjoyed getting out and wishing the other well wishers good new year. The towers are spectacular and s were the Poppies.. a stroll around the gardens under the bridge by the tower entrance is always a way to escape the bustle"

When you go upstairs you will find 2 runways connecting the two towers. These runways both contain transparent passages around the middle, so you get a nice view of the river and the bridge downstairs. The engine rooms are interesting as well. And make sure you visit in the summer, as it opens several times a day during the summer, but does not open in the winter. If you want to know the exact times it opens, you can ask at the Info desk of HMS Belfast, as they have this information and will tell you if you ask nicely. And the opening of the bridge is something that you definitely want to see. And maybe if you are really lucky you will see it open for a big cruise liner."

The road bridge opens when large vessels need to transit from the pool of London, Apart from using the bridge as a means of getting from one side of the river to the other, inside one of the towers is a museum where you can see the actual workings of the mechanisms that raise the road bridge. At one time you could go up the stairs of one tower and walk across the top bridge, then climb down the stairs on the other side....but I don't know if this is still possible, what with the crazy Health and Safety laws."

I think they will have to provide an audio guide to bring it to life.

After using the lift to get up to the walkway the guide told us how to see the various parts of the bridge and we were free to spend as much time as we wanted.We crossed the first side of the bridge and walked onto the glass floored section to gaze down on the traffic below which was fascinating. There was an illustrated history of the bridge along the walls and a short but very interesting film about how it was built.Passing through to the other side again we went onto the glass floor and this time lay down on it, taking a photo of ourselves in the mirror above out heads! We noted from the timetable posted at the end of the walkway that a boat was due in 10 minutes when the bridge would be opened (this happens about three times a day during summer). We asked a helpful member of staff where was the best place to watch and she directed us along the river side up to the 'onion', as the Greater London council building is referred to, so we managed to get some good photos of the great bridge opening!Afterwards we returned and went into the engine room, on the same side of the river and saw the great engines that had previously powered the bridge opening, resplendent in beautifully painted green, red and cream.It only took an hour of our time but was good fun and very interesting."

Tower bridge is an iconic landmark in London and was built over an 8 year period between 1886-1894 with the loss of 10 lives during the construction.From the entrance there's a lift that takes you up the North Tower to a room where you can watch footage of the construction. Access to the east walkway is on the left and although I have no fear of heights, taking the first step onto the glass floor is quite nerve wracking! 42m below the vehicles on the road look like toys and the people are like ants. The west walkway also has mirrors on the ceiling so you can take selfies lying on the glass floor. A lift in the South Tower takes you down to road level where you can follow the blue line on the ground which leads to the Engine Rooms below the bridge. Victorian ingenuity came up with a way to open the bridge in order to allow ships through, there are also interactive exhibits to explain how the machinery works."

The cashier was arguing the toss until I took him to the item on display and he then reluctantly let me have it at the price shown. A mistake, I would hope so, but he obviously was not used to having his prices checked.Other than that the gift shop items were reasonable priced and fair value selling some items not seen elsewhere.Disabled can visit the bridge tour as there are lifts to all floors, and to the machine room which is in a different part, away from the towers."

For views that are very hard to beat this is one attraction in London you really shouldn't miss, the price is very reasonable for a Central London Attraction too and when we visited, lunchtime in July the queue time was quite short. You start the attraction by entering a lift in which a tour guide gives a short talk about the bridge. You then enter the exhibition walkways which are filled with interesting information about the bridge and the views over the Thames are excellent. There is an added bonus of a glass floor walkway which is fun for kids and adults. The staff are helpful, informative and friendly, it was my daughter's birthday and the guide organised a chorus of Happy Birthday from our tour in the lift! The staff also gave her a 15% discount in the souvenir shop which were nice touches. My only grumble was that the ladies toilets near the top of the attraction were out of order, so I had a long walk downstairs to use the ones at the bottom and then one of these was out of order! Overall though a good attraction, reasonably priced (and this attraction accepts Tesco vouchers) with outstanding views."

You can do the exhibition which is very interesting and gives lots of history about the bridge and go right to the top and walk along the walkways which offer superb views of London, as well as having a glass floor so you can look straight down at the road and river below. If you're nervy about heights, don't worry as the glass floor is only a couple of panels, and also has proper flooring around it so you can walk around it if you don't want to walk on the glass. I didn't realise the bridge was used regularly for boats, I'd always thought it was only used for special occasions but to see the bridge open up was quite impressive. If you go on the Tower Bridge website, they have a list of all the times that the bridge opens."

The original lattice work has been fully glazed giving great views up and downstream. Some of the windows have been covered with a fascinating display of iconic bridges around the world. The best part though are the glass panels in the floor and the mirrors above them. Great to watch people's reaction to them - some wont even acknowledge they are there whilst others are happy to lie on them looking at the view belowWasn't too busy even on a Friday afternoon"

It took my wife a while to pluck up the courage to step on it though !!The views up and down the Thames were excellent as it was a sunny clear day and the Bridge had lots of information about this and other bridges.Included in ticket was a trip to the engine room of the bridge. This is in a separate building a short walk from the Tower entrance, although easy to find.We were glad to have done it, although would not be likely to return as I feel it is a 'do it once' attraction."

It has since opened to the public and is marketed as a place to visit like many places these days and has become popular. However, there was not a long queue to get in when we visited on a weekday fortunately. There were many tourists once inside all enjoying what there was to see. First of all you find an entrance area with photos of the old days and an artificial display of fish from Billingsgate Market as it used to be in baskets. You go up the first section in a lift (there are stairs if you want an option. The lift is modern and fast and everything is well decorated and in immaculate condition. Once upstairs, you can begin the walk across - high above the opening section. The walls are decorated with pictures of other famous bridges across the world and explanations. It is in this first walkway, that you find the glass walkway which is larger than the one in the Spinnaker Tower in Southampton. You don't have to walk over the glass section but you can get a paper badge if you do and many people had great fun, walking, sitting on it and simply taking photos. Continue to the other tower section and you will find a film but not enough seating as it is not a large area. You then walk down the other walkway, opposite the first and can get views from the windows there of the other side of the river - again with more pictures of bridges.There was a machine for cold drinks and it was very hot but it kept rejecting our money. The drinks were priced at \u00a31.50p but we were charged \u00a35 at a caf\u00e9 / bar outside! There are toilets at various stages which are clean and of course free.Back down the second lift, we then had to go outside the building and along the road with the general public following signs to the engine room. It was amazing to see how these work but unless you are an engineer - difficult to understand. However, just to see the machines all brightly painted in red, green and brown was wonderful. All parts are caged for health and safety but you can take photos anywhere. We were disappointed that we did not see the guides in costume giving explanations as in the promotional video on the internet. However, overall it was an experience I am glad I had. The gift shop at the end of the engine room sold the usual tourist gifts - cards, key rings, books etc. We didn't see the bridge open up on this occasion but have done so at other times when not visiting the building - an amazing feat of engineering especially in its day."

Having just a few hours to spare until I had to traveling home, I decided to visit Tower Bridge. Despite it being busy, it didn't take too long for me to purchase my ticket and go to the first level of the bridge.The views of London were amazing, and the glass floor was a great experience. It was fascination looking through the glass floor viewing the boats traveling on The Thames underneath us! Would recommend this attraction who only had a spare hour or two in the capital."

We opted for the stairs, which, if you are physically able, is a real fun thing to do. You get to see all of the inside of the building, the metal work, etc.The exhibition at the top of the tower was good. Would have liked a bit more history. Same with the underground pump rooms, the signs were in odd places and it was very hard to read them without being in the way. There were a lot of interesting objects with no signs about what they were as well.It ends on a really dull note. The \"Building Bridges: The Female Perspective\" is the last thing before exiting through the gift shop, and it was really unclear about why it was there. Its such a shame as its a really interesting idea, but I had to go home and google it to know anything about it. Seems weird to call it the female perspective... Is the female perspective all soft and fluffy and about family/community? (with exception of Pauline Etim-Ubah). Would have preferred a exhibition ON historical women in industry."

It looks romantic from far (but not too far coz it'll look tiny), and rather majestic (and rapunzel tower feel) as you stand on the bridge looking up the towers. An hour before the sun sets, take a slow walk from the bridge near St. Paul and towards Tower Bridge. It's lovely. But the borough market is nearby too so plan well."

You get passed the 1st glass-floor, walk to the end and turn around into the other walk-bridge. The 2nd glass-floor is amazing with Mirror on the Ceiling!! Be there when the bridge is lifted! It's about 1 hour tour, excluding the Engine Room which would take additional 30 minutes. There is only 1 toilet at each floor when you walked up. So don't get hang up and wait and que at the 1st toilet you come across. Move on to the next floor and you would definitely see another toilet!"

Aside from the color the bridge is truly magnificent because it is large and ornate and as appealing lines. It is so wonderful to to see examples of beautiful architecture and stonework. One just doesn't see things like this in the states. The bridge is lovely to admire from the river side or the tower or even just walking across it."

Money well spent!We checked the bridge opening times on the website before planning our day. We watched one bridge opening from the riverside and then, an hour later, viewed a second from Tower Bridge glass walkway above street level.When you visit the bridge you start at street level and can either take a lift or walk the 200+ stairs to the top of the North Tower. The stairs are roomy and their are places to stop for a quick rest if you need to. There are also toilets at some levels as you walk up/down. When you get to the to, the views are stunning and it's great to watch the boats travelling back and forth.The glass walkway is brilliant. We were both pretty scared to walk on this initially but got braver as time went on. Once you're across the walkway, there is somewhere to sit and watch a video about the bridge before visiting the second walkway.When you exit the tower, you follow a route to the engine rooms. These are really clean and informative. Great attraction for little money - well worth it.Please click below if you found this review helpful."

On Halloween weekend 2015, I actually did the London Bridge Experience with some friends. It's really nicely done, and it's great to walk up all those steps inside the Tower Bridge! The walk across the top is also fab, history of the bridge but also a brief history of bridges in general and how technology has advanced them! Worth doing, only takes an hour, good value for central London!"

Myself and my partner purchased tickets for the Tower Bridge Exhibition and it was worth every penny, plus it was reasonably priced too. The views you get of London on a clear day are incredible, plus the added bonus of seeing the traffic and pedestrians under your feet is great.An enjoyable couple of hours sent finding out more about this iconic bridge and all it's features."

They have some pictures of famous bridges from around the world which was interesting and other than that, there's not much to do.Then we walked off the bridge towards the Mayor's office building to view the opening and closing of the bridge which happened to be at the same time.Then we walked back across the bridge towards the Tower of London side and had these yummy red pepper chicken pizzas at one of the food tents outside the Guoman Hotel, the booths are part of the hotel. Even though it was raining, we were nice and dry under the tree next to the food tent.There are good photo ops, from the Tower of London side, as well as from the Mayor's office side."

This iconic symbol of London was built between 1886-1894 and is absolutely worth a visit and a must see when you're in London.The total length is 244 metres and its height is 65 metres.For GBP 9,00 you can go inside and have a look in the engine room and go on the glass floor to have a stunning view over the river and the city.On the north bank of the river Thames next to the bridge you'll find several places to eat and relax and of course there's a Starbucks. If you walk a little further, just behind the Tower Hotel, you'll find an interesting & beautiful small harbour called St. Katharine Docks, with many restaurants like The Dickens Inn and the Medieval Banquet, where you can eat medieval style. Here you can also find Gloriana, the Queen's rowbarge.Finally a absolutely must-do for those who like to walk: if you go over the Tower Bridge and go right for about 800 metres, you end up at a great promenade along the southbank of the Thames River that goes all the way to the London Eye (and further), with many restaurants, bars, coffeeshops and even beaches and boardwalks!"

It cost about \u00a320 for a family of four and it was \u00a320 well spent. A good tip for you if you are planning to go is to get your Ticket from the wrong side of the bridge near the engine rooms. The main visitor centre gets crowded but there is a small gift shop at the end of the tour where you can buy your tickets from. We started at the engine rooms and once finished made our way across the bridge and skipped the queues to the main attraction. There is a bag search as you go in and you can choose to go up the tower using the lift or the stairs. Unfortunately the lift wasn't working that day but honestly if you can do the stairs it is so much better. The structure inside is amazing to see and you would miss it all if you took the lift. There are plenty of benches on the way up for you to take a rest if needed. I don't consider myself a fit person but I handled them without any problems.There are exhibitions, facts and videos at the top of the stairs and along the walkway above the bridge itself. The views are stunning! The glass floor is brilliant and kept the kids entertained for a while.At the other side of the walkway it wasn't very clearly signposted, but you need to take the lift down, there doesn't appear to be any stairs down this tower. This can get quite busy but the lift is quite large and can fit a lot of people in one go.The whole trip only takes about an hour and a half and is easily accessible from London Bridge Tube Station. It's well worth a visit if you're looking for something different to do in London without breaking the bank."

If you want to see the bridge open to allow tall masted ships to sail through, check the bridge lift times on the Tower Bridge website. At night when floodlit, the bridge has a different atmosphere again. One of my favourite London memories is sitting at the outdoor tables of the Tower Hotel Brasserie with a drink, watching the floodlit bridge open late at night to allow a boat through.

It's bigger than you think, Cambridge-bluer than you can see in just photos, there's a lot to be seen from it, and... on a weekend... lots of people! It's the place to go if you are a visitor.The history, the engineering, the stone- and iron-work and the Thames, can only be truly appreciated by seeing the real thing. It took me 60 years, and it was worth it. You could pay to go to the top of one of the towers, and I'm sure it would have been a great view, especially of the adjacent Tower of London, but you'd have to be early to avoid the queues.The only thing that would have made our visit better is if we had actually seen the bridge open. But nothing plying the Thames was big enough that day to warrant such a moment.The Bridge is easy to get to on the Tube or walk to from downtown London."

If you're in a rush you can skip the first part of the tour which lets you check out the pistons and mechanism that raises the bridge. Make sure you check out the glass floor on both walkways. Fantastic photo op - perhaps not the best for those afraid of heights."

Still, it has lots of offer and most visitors won't be disappointed with the experience.You get to visit both the North and South Towers, the Engine Rooms plus cross the walkways between the Towers. Both walkways have glass floors for at least part of their lengths and, not unsurprisingly, these tend to have a magnetic effect on a large number of visitors, especially those armed with selfie-sticks. I have to admit, the view through the floor to the bridge traffic below and then the Thames below that - more than 40 metres down - is pretty good. You also get good panoramic views up and down the Thames. While these views are splendid, I wouldn't rate them as highly as those from the London Eye. And the view down to the river from the walkways when they raise the bridge (to let river traffic pass) must be stunning - assuming you can be up there when a Bridge Lift takes place. Arranging your visit to coincide with such a lift - and there is a schedule of at least four or five each day - would be smart move. You also get to see the Engine Rooms as well as very accessible exhibitions on the construction of the bridge during the late nineteenth century and on other major bridges of the world. The giant steam engines, boilers and other massive contraptions in the Engine Room have long ago been decommissioned and are now an impressive array of gleaming polished and painted metal. For the mechanically minded (and unfortunately that's not me) it must a wondrous sight."

Once you depart the lift there is a short video you can view before you enter. Once you start walking across the bridge you see there are information boards about other famous bridges across the world (I was surprised how many I had been on) and facts about Tower Bridge and its construction. About half way, you come across the glass floor panels which you will be able to stop, walk across (yes, apparently the glass can bare the weight of 6 elephants!) and even sit or lay down should you wish (for those all important selfies of course!) There is another video at the end which talks through the construction of the bridge. You then catch the elevator back down to the ground, and follow the blue arrow painted on the floor (I'd never noticed this before) across the bridge to the engine rooms. Once in here you can see how the engines operate, watch another video and at the end of the journey you can even record a short video to email to your friends and family! Of course, there's the gift shop too! I chose to buy the combined ticket which allowed me to visit both the Tower of London and Monument for \u00a311. This makes a good saving as for adults it would be \u00a313.50 should both be purchased separately. Also, incase you're visiting for more than one day, you don't have to visit both places on the same day as the ticket is valid for 7 days! To summarise a great day, great views, educational and suitable for any age so long as you're not afraid of heights of course!"

Then you walk across the bridge which has a lot of information about this bridge, as well as bridges around the globe. There are areas with a glass bottom for a thrill. You walk through to another film and then down the street to an engine room. Overall, it was interesting, but if we'd had to pay, we would've been disappointed.

The queue was mindboggling, extended down the street, even for London Pass holders. There is a staircase to take you upstairs too, if you are willing to climb so many stairs.For others, there is an elevator, & hence the queue. Once on top, you first get to see a short documentary on the construction of the Bridge. Post this; you walk down the glass walkway, which makes a few people jittery.So be careful if you are scared of heights. The view of the city is good, while under you, you can see the brown water of the Thames flowing. A display also lists the times for the bridge opening & closing.We were fortunate enough to witness this a little later when the Tower Bridge opened to let a passenger vessel pass. After coming down the Tower, I also visited the Engine Room where the machinery operating the bridge is on display.Overall, a good experience"

The 'highlight' for most people are probably the glass walkways which are on both sides of the bridge links - personally I couldn't even look down on the road below let alone step onto the glass - and there were lots of people enjoying the experience. There are great photo opportunities for both sides of the bridge up and down the Thames and if you get your timings right you might even get to see the bridge open to let ships pass through. Highlight for us were the steam engines that are in place - one of which was 'working' - I'm not a mechancially minded person but even I could appreciate the beauty and elegance of these beautiful huge wheels. On a Two for One offer this visit was excellent value although at full price would obviously complete with other attractions."

The part of the machinery is quite interesting, and it is well worth the \u00a38 we paid for the ticket.The best part is possibly the crystal passages in the two beams of the bridge. It is quite scary to step on them, but once you do, pictures taken from that height are nothing like anything else in London. Well done for that!It can be very funny to go with small children.

The walk is easy because pedestrian designated walk is designed for this purpose. To walk across the bridge, check the time of the drawbridge open for boat traffic because you might get stuck for a while.. It was neat to witness the working of the drawbridge (the mid span of the bridge to let boat through). The bridge is practically in the same area of the London Tower and it. took about 10 minutes to walk from the London Tower visitor center to the edge of the bridge on the Tower side. A small fee is required to go up to the walking bridge (second level). After the London Tower and the Tower Bridge, I recommend lunch/dinner on the other side (City Hall side) of the river."

This attraction is very good value for money and the queues outside should not put you off as they move relatively quickly.Once inside you travel up to the walkway across the top of the bridge where there are presentations, videos and exhibitions explaining the construction of the structure and how it works. Along the walkway there are more informative boards describing other bridges and structures around the world explaining the different types of construction and how they all compare. The view up and down the Thames with the London skyline is stunning and for the discerning photographers there are small windows that can be opened to allow shots unhindered by glass.Midway along the walkway there is a glass floor to look vertically down through above the main bascule section which if you time your visit correctly you will be able to watch the road section lift to allow vessels to pass beneath. Do not worry if you cannot walk on the glass floor, there are solid side sections to walk on for those unsure.The entry ticket also allows you access to the engine rooms which power the bascules, this is a short walk to the south side of the bridge and underneath, it is well worth making the short trip to see the engines and counterweights that lift the road structure.Allow yourselves a good one to two hours to take everything in and some advice for the elderly and small children, wait for the lift to access the walkway as there are more steps than you would think if you decide to walk!"

The Tower Bridge is a grand bridge that opened in 1894.This is the bridge that the Americans thought they were buying when the bought London Bridge.The Bridge is by the Tower of London. Many tourists and Londoners visit the bridge every day. It symbolises London.The Bridge opens up to let tall ships pass through at certain times of the day.There is a high level walkway with a glass floor. However, I gave that a miss when I visited the bridge because I do not like heights. But for those who do not suffer from vertigo, this is worth going on.The opening hours in summer (April to October) for the tour of the bridge is between 10am and 5.30pm (last admission). Admission prices are GBP 9.00 for adults and children up to the age of 15 years GBP 3.90. (June 2016). There are deals for a family of 2 adults and 2 children (GBP20.30) and also for groups of ten or more for which the prices per person work out cheaper.You should consider visiting the bridge together with a visit to the Tower of London as it represents better value for money.

My wife & I visited this after Tower of London, and we found this exhibit to be extremely well organised.There were clear signs and marked paths to the entrance and with our London Pass, we went straight to the elevators and reach the top. My wife had the most fun and thrills walking on the glass bottom floors, looking down to the traffic and crowds below. I personally enjoyed the views at the top of the surrounding area more, especially since there are small windows all along the bridge that you can open and peek out for photos, so you don't have the glass reflections on your photos.There is also a Tower Bridge app you can download where you can see augmented bridge lifts if you weren't able to see it in real life, which is a bonus.As you exit out of the main exhibition, there are clear lines marked to lead you to the Engine Room, the 2nd part of the exhibit, where you can see the engines/machines that control the bridge lifts.Highly recommend visiting both, but definitely don't miss the 1st part. The view at the top is worth the admission price alone."

We opted to the do the tour, booking in advance and getting \u00a31 discount on each ticket. It is not a specific timed ticket like a lot of attractions in London, which is helpful.We swapped our print out for a ticket and went in the lift to the first stop at the top of one tower. You walk across one of the walkways, to the other tower, across the other walkway and then back. It was a bit underwhelming in all honesty. The videos in the towers were old fashioned and dull and not at all interactive. There is information on other bridges across the world on display on the walkways and although this was mildly interesting, I doubt this would keep children entertained at all. There were some small windows through which you could take a photograph without the usual glare when taking it through glass, but these were placed very high and even on my very tip toes at 5 ft 3 I struggled to be able to take advantage of them. Probably the feature that the attraction would boast about the most is the glass floor on both walkways which allows you to look down on the road below. This seemed to be a in a stark contrast to the rest of the attractions which was quite dated. A bit gimmicy really and nothing particularly to look at. At the end of the tour of the towers, the ticket also entitled visitors to visit the engine room which was a walk towards the south bank. Not really worth the additional walk, this was again very dry and lacked the interactive exhibits that tend to be in these kinds of places. We would not have paid more than \u00a38 each and would not recommend this for younger children who need more to entertain them than the view."

I visited Tower Bridge with my 12 and 14 year old children and my mother, and all three generations really enjoyed it. To be inside the iconic bridge was very exciting. The views from the top are spectacular and I really like the thought that had gone into having small opening windows at eye height, so that you could take photos without the reflection of the glass. The highlight for me was the transparent floor - no matter how much they tell you 'it can take the weight of an elephant', there is something psychologically challenging about walking out on it and being able to see the river below. Seeing my hesitation, Iain, the charming member of staff, took my hand and 'escorted' me out onto the glass - thank you ! When he gave me an 'I did it !' sticker, I felt as thrilled as child ! I was put to shame by my mother and daughter, who also walked out on the glass, without Iain's help. On the Eastern part of the bridge, the glass floor has a mirror above it, so you can take an amazing picture of yourself on the glass, with the river below. Awesome.There was an interesting display about other great bridges around the world, and about the building of Tower Bridge. You can also visit the engine rooms - to me they were not that interesting, but still impressive for sheer size, and I am sure that for someone with more knowledge of engineering than me, this would be a good finish to the visit."

This is worth a visit when you go by the nearby Tower of London."

There is a small section of the flooring between the towers that is glass right above where the two ends of the bridge meet in the middle. We were fortunate enough to have a large boat come through so we were able to view the bridge opening. We later found out that it happens about four times a day, and the operators know beforehand at approximately what time so it's probably worth checking out what time the next one is scheduled for and then going up. After we came back down, we visited the old engine room (included with the ticket), so for those keen on a quick lesson on engines, keep your eyes open for this!"

Now they even have replaced parts of the upper floor with a glass floor so you can look straight down at the cars and ships crossing 38 m below you. Quite a great fun and since the Tower Bridge is a well known symbol for London its just a must see.There are even foto machine on the top level where you could take a shot of yourself and then have you printed on a selection of tower bridge post cards you could then send home or take with you.I would also recommend to paid the entrance to be on the upper level just for the view and the feeling of it. Visiting the \"exhibition\" in the towers and the engine room is not that exiting and nothing I would pay for again. But the view definitly is."

Information on other famous bridges on display along the way. The whole tour lasts about one hour, and the price is not expensive (\u00a39 adult). I recommend it."

Truthfully, the Tower of London nextdoor gave us all we could hope for and more! Make sure to walk UNDER the bridge for the place the bodies would wash up after being thrown off the tower. SPOOKAY"

The highlight of the bridge tour is the observation areas, which feature amazing views of London. There are glass walkways that allow you to look down on the road and the river below. This year, they added mirrors above the walkway, which allows you to get some unique pictures. Don't miss walking through the engine room down the block to learn about the mechanics of the bridge."

First and foremost, it\u2019s a beautiful bridge that is just begging for your camera to capture it day and night. It\u2019s instantly obvious why it\u2019s a great seller for postcards. Second, it is a bridge and you can use it to get across the Thames. Lastly, it\u2019s a destination itself.

When a bridge was mooted for here in the late 19th Century it was decided that it should complement the appearance of the Tower, hence its iconic appearance.Because, in those days, the 'Pool of London' downstream of London Bridge was busy with much high-masted river traffic this bridge was provided with the famous bascules which would be raised and lowered numerous times daily. Nowadays the frequency is much lower as the Port of London moved downstream long ago. But it's a great sight when it happens.I still haven't ever paid to visit the interior but it's always a thrilling experience to view the exterior of the bridge from the river and to sail under it, as I did twice recently.Looking up, the glass floors on the high-level walkways could clearly be seen and I hope to be able to report on that experience at a later date."

I was more intrested in the construction side of the bridge and how and why it was built. I found a nice touch was the list of all the other famous bridges around the world that I really enjoyed. After the main bridge you can come out the bridge and walk south side of the river and see all the old pumps that were used at the time which was pretty cool too nice finishing touch for my family was we could take a boat on the thames back to where we live and you get to go under tower bridge and see it from a different perspective."

We weren't even planning this as part of our jam-packed trip, but having finished the Tower of London, we were right there so we decided to go as there were no lines. The history video was very interesting. While up on the bridge, the floors are transparent and so much fun to stand on while looking down. The views of London are wonderful. There's a lot of additional bridge information and history on display. The tour of the mechanical workings of the drawbridge down underneath was fascinating. All the employees were exceptionally friendly. We are so glad we went to this amazing landmark!"

The website gives opening times a few weeks in advance but be aware that the maintenance openings don't result in a full opening of the bridge.The bridge is open to traffic but the pedestrian pavements are wide and there are barriers to seperate you from the traffic. It is great fun for kids to stand halfway across the bridge and have a foot on either side of the opening as it wobbles a little as bigger vehicles go past.The exhibition is pretty good although the high spot is really the glass floors in the upper walkway. From there you are looking down at the bridge underneath. During uk school holidays they usually have free craft activities for children.It has recently been announced that the bridge will be closed for around 3 months for repairs/maintenance but I don't believe that the dates have been announced yet."

Last fall we returned to London, and walked the surrounding area, while enjoying the imposing Tower Bridge from afar. This May - another visit, so we walked to the bridge from our hotel and crossed on foot, which gave us the very best vantage point from which to appreciate the enormity and beauty of this bridge. GO!

They have some animation to show how the bridge was designed and built. The engine room is interesting. We didn't think we'd been there that long but we were there for about two hours. It's really well put together, it's fun, it doesn't overwhelm and the price is a winner. On a warm day you could take the kids to the water jets on the south bank by the Mayor of London office, and let them splash (bring extra clothes) a fun cheap day out in London"

Get to the tower early, right when it opens. You won't regret it. We went immediately to view the Crown Jewels, and there were about 5 other people in there with us, so we could view them leisurely, and really enjoy this part of the Tower. Don't miss seeing where they house the ravens. Hard to find, but it's worth seeing them, and reading about their care. They are flying and cawing all around the grounds, too, as they have clipped wings. The Tower is a MUST SEE. So much history here."

It is, of course, easily visible to all, but a visit to the exhibition is well worth the price. The lift takes you to the upper walkways where you can admire the views, peer down through the glass walkway to the road below and browse through the various information panels about the bridge. There is also an exhibition of panels giving pictures and information of other notable bridges in the world. After you come down, be sure to follow the blue line to the engine rooms which give a detailed insight into the workings of the bridge.There are higher views of London but not from the middle of the river. The elevated structure of the upper walkways therefore gives a unique view of the river and the buildings on either side.A feature of the bridge is of course the raising of the roadway.You can witness this from the glass walkway above, and whilst I am sure that would be an interesting perspective (if you can see through the crowds) the overall effect of the image can best be seen at a bit of a distance so you see all the bridge. Check the times the bridge is due to open and watch from one of the river banks with the sun behind you. That really is a truly iconic image."

A portion of the walkway has a glass floor and all text visitors took turns taking fun pictures with the traffic and Thames River hundreds of feet below. We decided to take the stairs up as the elevator had a huge line up but I recommend waiting for the elevator unless you are up to a good workout. If you have the London pass then admission is free for this attraction. Highly recommend!"

Althought there's a typically long queue to get into the lobby and you have to navigate a crowded rotating door before cramming into a lift with several strangers.Once up inside the bridge you can go at your own pace, theres plenty to see and do. not to mention incredible views on the walkway. The glass walkway is a little daunting, but a great view of the world and the river below!You have spectacular views of all the London landmarks including the Shard, City Hall, HMS Belfast, just to name a few.We loved it, visiting the engine room after the tour of the tower is well worth it, you get to see how the bridge used to be powered and of course visit the gift shop!"

It was very quick and easy to get in and the best priced attraction in London. Around \u00a37 for adults. It was brilliant once we arrived at the top with great views of the capital and good to see the magnificent architecture and engineering that went into building the bridge. The glass floor is a fairly new addition to tower bridge and is good fun if you dare to walk over it. Great attraction for all the family."

The exhibition isn't much, mostly info about bridges of the world, but the glass-bottomed walk you see between the towers is fantastic! People of all ages get creative getting their pix taken there ... it's so fun to see ... and there was a great guide when we were there. Howard clearly loved his job and relished sharing his knowledge and jokes. Seeing the workings of the bridge and learning what went into its making was interesting, too. All this combined to make this our favorite monument of the trip."

This time, I went, and I am so glad I did.First of all, take the time to enjoy the bridge itself. This place is an absolute marvel of Victorian engineering. Walk over the bridge (which is very pedestrian friendly) before exploring the exhibit.In the exhibit itself, first just let your eyes wander across the massive iron work that supports the whole bridge. The lovely vintage film loop of Edwardian London is also really worth a look as you move through.Honestly, I was not as impressed with the tower walks up top as others, because I had seen the London skyline before, but I did have some photo fun with the glass floor parts.The real star, though, is the old Victorian engine room. Pity the engine running is running on electrical power instead of steam, but it still gives a good sense of the scale of works involved here. Poke around a bit, too, there. The old reservoirs are still there to find.Absolutely go, enjoy one of the great marvels of the Victorian age, and take in a great view."

The bridge is massive with passage ways on both sides, and i read there is also the chance to take a tour in the structure.

Its a great sight to watch the bascules being opened for river traffic .The bascules are raised around 1000 times a year and the date and time are published on the website. You can plan your visit accordingly.We were lucky that while we were walking from the Tower of London towards the Bridge, the bascules opened.Combine this trip with the Tower of London as it is a nice 10 minutes walk along the river from the Tower.Closest tube is Tower Hill"

TIP: look up when you are on the glass walkway. There is a perfectly positioned mirror on the ceiling that easily lets you - or a group of people - take a selfie of them standing on the glass tiles with the traffic below. Even our height-issue friend was able to do this. She just couldn't look up or down while we stood on the glass. She just focused straight ahead while we snapped the photos and she was perfectly fine!

I also recommend you walk across the the (inside!) top of the bridge for fantastic views on the Thmes and London.Afterwards, walk up 10-15 min. to Brick Lane (or take the tube one stop as its it outside of Aldgate East underground station) for a delicious curry (the area is known for its Bangladeshi community and curries) at a reasonable (for London!) price. Enjoy!"

It is a fantastic bridge and an attraction you should not miss. When you are walking across the top, there are sections of the floor that are glass so you can see all the way down to the roadway and the water. That was a little freaky to me, but my husband and so many of the other visitors were loving it. It was a fantastic selfie opportunity. The views from the bridge were amazing. When we left the bridge, we headed back towards the tower of London side and there was an amazing street food fair right off to the side. Great selection of international foods and really affordable for a lunch."

It is a marvel of Victorian engineering, which you can best admire by walking the stairs up and down. Forget the lift, if you can. Once up, you will have a great view of the city for a fraction of the price that you have to pay at - the London Eye -. The glass floor can be a bit upsetting for those who do not have an eye for highness. However it is really something to see the traffic, the pedestrian and the water flowing below you."

I am fascinated by bridges, and I remember that Tower Bridge impressed me on my first visit to London with my parents a long time ago. On that visit we toured the Tower then but were unaware Tower Bridge could be walked across (and I don\u2019t know whether they had tours then). So when I discovered the Tower Bridge tour in a guidebook before a recent business trip to London, we decided to go on the afternoon we arrived before we started work. We were not disappointed. I recommend walking north to south, as we did, on the east side of the roadway. The entrance to the Tower Bridge Exhibition is in the north tower on the east (left as you walk from the north) side. After paying your reasonably priced admission and having any bags checked, you ride a lift to the upper walkways (we had no wait but there can be queues for the lifts). The tour guides were very good. You walk south on the east walkway, then north on the west walkway, then back south on the west walkway. From the walkways you get spectacular views, especially from the west walkway, even on an overcast day. You also get amazing views looking down through the glass floors of the walkways (and don\u2019t forget to look up and see yourself and the river in the mirror above). You then descend in a lift (or sometimes they let you walk all the way down on the stairs, as we were able to do) and continue south across Tower Bridge (road level) to see the engine room. Note: it is free to just walk across Tower Bridge on the sidewalk that parallels the road.Tower Bridge is a working drawbridge that does open periodically (schedule can be found online). I did not see a lift (opening), but expect the tour is rather crowded at that time. It would have been fun to see a lift from the shore."

I've wanted to do this for a while but waited for decent weather for a good view down the Thames and across the city.It's one of the cheaper attractions on London and doesn't let you down when it comes to value for money. It can take a while to get in as there's limited space in the lift to the top of the first tower but once your up you can take your time, enjoy the views of London, look through the glass floor at the traffic and Thames below or just read the many information boards spread along the walk way.Cross over the 'road' from above and walk down the opposite side and then head down and out to see the original and amazingly maintained 'engine' room.All in all a good attraction worth seeing and worth the money, combine it with a trip to see The Monument and save even more."

Working in London can be a bit stressful when commuting, queuing at lunch and rushing around, but if you're lucky enough to be close to Tower Bridge or you're visiting the area, take 20minutes to appreciate Londons most historic bridge!There is an entry fee if you wish to walk over the viewing glass or go into the engine room but just walking across the bridge seeing the H.M.S Belfast, Tower of London and city skyline is a nice experience on its own.If you leave the bridge on the south side using the steps walk a few paces down Shad Themes and turn left into the Old Brewer House. There is a little walk through with a few steps that lead into the Themes itself! If you're there when the tide is out you can walk down into the themes so you're almost under the bridge ;)If you leave the bridge on central side using the steps next to Dead Mans Gate (where they used to pull bodies out of the river) there is always an ice cream van and a hippy camper van which both sell hot/cold refreshments. Or if you're watching the pennies there is also a Tesco extra... Grab a drink and take in the scenery St.Catherine's Dock is also 2 minutes round the corner! There's always beautiful boats in there include one of the Queens.. It's free to walk around and has bars/restaurants around it.ENJOY!!"

We bought our tickets in advance and therefore didn't have to queue. I'd recommend this as I'd imagine the queues can get quite long. There's a large lift to bring people up to the platforms that crosses the bridge. One of our kids hates lifts and got very upset with it on the way up and the staff couldn't do enough to help us. They were unbelievably helpful and did all that they could to help calm her. You can then walk across the bridge and look down at the river and traffic below through a glass floor. At the opposite end of the platform, there's a video showing how the bridge was constructed. On both sides you can see details on various other famous bridges the world over and the views are amazing. Bring your camera for both selfies through the glass floor and the view out of the bridge itself. Separate to the bridge but part of the tour is the original steam engine room that pulled the bridge up. This was fascinating and very well done. You could see one of the steam engines working , the hydraulic pumps and the counter weights. Fascinating if you're into engineering and how things work. Overall a great couple of hours and not at all expensive compared to some of the other attractions in London."

London is a terrific city to walk around, but it's important to note that if you decide to fit in all of the touristy landmarks, it's a pretty significant walk from Big Ben to the bridge. I would recommend taking a bus tour, which will take you as far as Tower Bridge to the east and Westminster to the west, as well as the arts district to the north. I was able to get some good pics on a fittingly overcast day. The Tower Bridge has a lot of history around it. And, it's absolutely beautiful. Why don't they make structures like this anymore? Such detail and craftsmanship. It is situated in the middle section of London and offers terrific westerly views of the River Thames as well as the Tower of London. "

Nice views out of the small windows which were quite high up so my husband had to take them as I couldn't reach. We didn't get a chance to go to the Engine Rooms as we had a show booked and didn't have time but considering we had used our vouchers we didn't mind and thought it was a nice short visit on a lovely day to an attraction I might not have otherwise considered visiting.

Would a trip to London be complete without walking across this bridge while singing the kids song about London Bridge falling down? This attraction won`t take long and offers some unique pictures of the views from the top. Take the lift or climb the stairs. Read about the people that built the bridge. Learn about the engineering and architectural technology that was utilized. Take some selfies while walking over the glass floor. Go down to see the engine rooms that power the bridge."

The bridge is the halfway point for the marathon. Actually the marathon spirit added to joy, the crowds were cheering the runners and sang along with the music \"wo oh we're almost there, oh ho we're living on a prayer\" now that is something else. The tour is approx 9 BP for adult and 4PB child. The tour is fun and takes about an hour. The glass floor is amazing and videos explain the story of the bridge and constraction .The views are superb. Still a classic, highly recommended. Tip, there is s photo machine 3PB per photo, does not give change. Bring exact change, also bring 1PB and a 1 penny if you want to do those flatten penny coins. Great souvenir shop at the end. Enjoy."

This year we visited Tower Bridge.We had pre-booked the tickets online and found the entry process very easy and well managed by the staff. A lift to the upper level with a brief introduction set the scene and then finding out more about the construction was interesting with some amazing facts.Then we went across the first walkway - fortunately there is just enough space to the side of the glass floor for those of a nervous disposition to avoid stepping on the glass, which I suppose is a good idea as she may still have been up there otherwise refusing to go across! I enjoyed watching the goings on beneath my feet.The displays are interesting and the short walk to the Engine rooms are certainly worth it.Now I just have to decide what high place I can take her next year."

The Tower Bridge is arguably one of London's moist iconic landmarks - and rightly so.The bridge, built in the late 1800's, is being kept in impeccable condition and still uses much of its original mechanics. Its a fantastic place to visit and marvel at the engineering skills and ingenuity of its designers over 100 years ago.The bridge deck is freely accessible to anyone (pedestrians and vehicles) but the towers and the engine rooms from the victorian era are part of a museum tour which charges admission.But even if you are not interested in engineering and it's functional features, it's still a marvelous historic monument and a must-do item on your London sightseeing list..."

Situated on the River Thames near the Tower of London reaches over 200 feet tall and offers the viewing platform high between the two towers. You can walk or drive the lower deck for free, or pay \u00a39 (adult; discounts for age and families) for the Tower Bridge Exhibition daily from 10am to 5:30pm. The tour lasts 1.5 hours and you visit the upper platforms, inside the towers and the mechanical working parts that opens the draw."

It has great history but where it excels is making the most of what is, essentially, a visit to a bridge.You ride a lift to the top and then walk across two glass-bottomed floors that give views of the road and Thames below. There are great views of the Tower of London and the Thames.The walls are filled with history of the bridge though my favorite exhibit was the photos and facts of all the other remarkable bridges in the world. A video follows (not all that compelling) of the making of the bridge, and then you head back to the street, follow a blue line and visit an exhibit of the old hydraulic system once used to power the drawbridge. You can also plan to visit during times the drawbridge opens and closes; times are posted online."

We had not pre-booked and after paying and having our bags checked we went straight up in the lift without queuing at all. Our favourite bit without doubt was the glass floor. I was determined to walk across it and after a few false starts managed to do it! People were sitting on it and lying on it and it was great fun. There is a 'postcard' photo facility which isn't too expensive and produced a very good quality picture which was a great memento to take home. If you want to visit the engine rooms and well stocked gift shop you do so after exiting Tower Bridge and following the signs to both. It doesn't take long to experience Tower Bridge but it is well worth a visit ."

Last year I went on a solo trip to the Tower Bridge Exhibition and I loved it, so when my sister visited from the States I wanted her to experience it too. We had a very packed schedule since she was here for only a few days and one afternoon we had a little extra free time and decided to go. The website said that last admittance was at 5:30, so we assumed that that meant there would be 1-2 hours given to explore the exhibition and proceed to the engine rooms; similar to how Westminister Abby gives 1 hour after last entrance. We were very wrong!After purchasing tickets (\u00a315) at about 5:20 we went to the lift and were taken to the exhibition, we got there between 5:30 and 5:40. We started by leisurely walking through the exhibition reading each plaque and watching the videos. About 10 minutes before 6pm we saw staff going to other groups and speaking to them (no one ever came to us); apparently the engine rooms closed at 6pm and anyone wishing to see them had to head over there immediately. We had not even completed half of the exhibition, but my sister wanted to see the engine rooms, and they were included in the price of the ticket. We skipped the rest of the exhibition (even though she wanted to see that as well) and hurried to get to the engine rooms before 6. We got to the engine room at 5:59 and we're admitted. It was at that point where we saw a sign that said the gift shop closed at 6:15. We made it through the engine rooms while doing very little reading and watch the video near the end. We left at approximately 6:25. We were very busy for the rest of her visit so we were unable to attempt a second trip to the exhibition. What displeased me the most is that we were not informed online, at the ticket desk, or in the lift (in fact we were told there would be enough time to explore what we wanted) that the engine room was closing at 6pm and they we would have to walk through the exhibition without stopping to enjoy anything if we wanted to see it all in time. I am also displeased that she and I were not told while in the exhibition, we had to overhear then inform another group. So we ended up wasting \u00a315.From past experience I know the exhibition is very enjoyable, but my suggestion to anyone who wants to see it, is that you go no later than 4pm."

The tour is self guided and our ticket included a tour of the engine rooms. Very interesting to see how the bridge worked when it was first built. If you are brave enough, step onto the glass walkway! If not, hold on to the railings and tip toe on the side. I was completely terrified but if you take out your cell phone and look at it you hardly notice your over 100 feet above water."

But, Tower Bridge makes a mark even from afar, with its beautiful old shape and architecture. I walked from the train station, saw it as I reached the pier from the right side and felt a lump in my throat. The bridge I sang of in school 35 years ago was there in front of me in real life. I walked towards it and the closer i got, the more awesome it became. This is a not-to-be-missed icon if you ever visit London. Around the corner from it is the Tower of London and the real London Bridge. You can also walk to the Millennium Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge, which are all nicer looking than London Bridge."

For those who are not too worried about actually going inside, obviously you can just walk along the river and see it. A good view can be seen from the Great Fire of London Monument.However I really do recommend you go inside as I think \u00a39 is really good value for London, plus is available on the 2 for 1 offer if you travel by train so even better.This was the second time we visited but was well worth paying a second time. Great views as you walk along the top (take the stairs - don't be lazy and use the lift) and some interesting facts about other famous bridges. A new addition since our last visit is the glass floor which is quite cool as you can see the road and river below you and use a mirrored ceiling to take a picture of yourself on the glass.After exiting the bridge, the cost of your ticket also allows you to visit the 'engine room' and see some of the mechanics that would have previously been used when raising the bridge.There is also an app you can download to experience what it is like while the bridge is being raised. This was OK. I doubt it really reflects what its like, but it is a free download so worth checking it out.A must visit attraction when in London."

My family and I were visiting the Tower of London when we decided to walk across Tower Bridge to the South Bank to catch a train back to our hotel after our visit. I've been to London several times and have never set foot on the bridge so I was all for it. I have to say that I am absolutely delighted that we did. Other than the 10,000 pictures I ended taking (okay, just an exaggeration), the view from the bridge is magnificent all around. If you want, go ahead and take the tour (I think it's called the Tower Bridge Experience), I wish we did but it was getting late in the day so we didn't get around to it but if you don't want to spend the money, just walk across it from the Tower of London to the South Bank, the bridge itself just takes your breath away. It's about a 10 minute stroll across, what with all the stops to take pictures) and we enjoyed it very much. In the past, we've done the boat ride that goes under the bridge and being on the bridge allowed us a new perspective of the Thames and all its surroundings. Definitely recommended if you're in London. The Tower on one side and the South Bank on the other, what's not to like?"

The floor in several places is glass and so vertigo grasps anyone so affected since you are above 100 feet above the road traffic and a few feet more above the Thames River. All along the walk inside are graphic illustrations of the bridge construction and its predecessors and its importance to local commerce and river traffic. There is no rush to traverse the length inside and you can actually return via the walk opposite the one you took over.

Usually the first thing people want to see to on the river, but there are far better things to do. Having lived in London for well over 30 years I pass over this bridge on a regular basis so to me there is no novelty value other than it's a pain for the locals when there is \"A Lift\" (an opening of the bascules). Please bare in mind there is only so much you can do with a bridge to exciting and fun but as for value for money goes this is not the best one! You pay a small fortune to be herded into a small lift and took up to a room with a video projection presentation that looked outdated as soon as it was installed. After a short but somewhat unhelpful presentation you are frog marched up to another level and you can walk across the over gantries between the two towers. This is the only bit of excitement on the whole trip. You can peer down through the glass on the river or the road depending if the bridge is raised or not. It's ok, but why? The view up and down the river is no different as you are only a few feet up in the air, add to this as you are already in \"the view\" you miss out on the river view of the bridge if you get my logic! As soon as you are over to the other end you are off down a long set of stairs and you then have to follow the line to the engine house. Now, when I first started going here as a kid you could walk all the way around the engines, poke about, touch them, ask questions and even turn a few knobs and dials. Now it's all fell foul to H&S which has ruined it. Also in the early days of the museum you could go down into the bowls of the bridge into the bascule chamber and if you were lucky you could stand at the door and watch a massive weight go by, but even this is out of bounds. To top it all you are forced through a hum drum shop selling all the usual tat. At the end of it you feel let down and realize there are better things to spend your money on like HMS Belfast next door or walking around the docks next door that are free. In all very poor value for money and not a great deal to look at."

On my last visit, the Tower Bridge opened a few of its rooms to exhibit the place where Royalty had been imprisoned. The new attraction, something which was not available on my last visit, were the walkways between the two towers and a visit to the engine room.But beware. There is steep climb up to the top so the fainthearted should not waste their money.The walkways give you a bids eye look straight down on the traffic which flows over the bridge and the ships which pass under the bridge. It s a great sight. Worth the price.There are two video exhibits which give you an insight into the construction of the bridge and both are very interesting.Once you finish with the top, you can go down to the basement and see the massive engines which are still used to operate the bridge and bring up the bridge when large ships need to pass.

After the bridge itself we looked at the Victorian engine rooms to see how the two spans are raised and lowered."

Like I said on my review of the Tower Of London it is a good one to do on the same day as the Tower... both being very close to each other.Only drawback, as with the Tower, is it can get very busy and is quite expensive.Don't rush it. Once you get inside, take your time... sit down... soak it up... look in all the nooks and crannies and corners... there is so much to see if you let yourself take the time to really get into it. I have spend hours up on the walkways watching the river and imagining London of the past etc.And don't forget to visit the old engine rooms too."

If you are walking, try go down and walk along the river side where there are about 3 to 4 large hotels. You will see loads of people walking by the river, or having a drink or coffee. I once stayed at the Guoman Hotel Tower Bridge for a party and asked for the tower bridge view. Wow, it was so close it felt like you could touch or taste it.

This view would probably be slightly enhanced by the bridge opening but it was not to be for me. Overall, I wasn\u2019t that impressed with the walkway and felt it wasn't worth the price, and my opinion wasn\u2019t helped by people lying on the glass floor taking selfies for whatever reason, blocking the passage almost completely. I also took in a visit to the engine room (which is included), but Victorian Engineering baffles me, so I trundled through it at a fair old clip."

However, there are lifts for people who are unable to climb up all the stairs. The upper level also has little windows so you can take photographs of the views of the surrounding areas.If you are lucky, you may be able to watch the bridge open to allow ships to pass underneath it.Your ticket also includes a visit to the Victorian engine rooms, just a few minutes\u2019 walk from the South Tower, where you can see the original machinery that powered the bridge\u2019s lifts when it was first built. We saw huge, well maintained steam engines, furnaces and accumulators that were once used to power the raising of Tower Bridge\u2019s bascules (the moveable roadways at the bridge\u2019s centre). We found this interesting and informative. Good value for money and not as expensive as some of the other London attractions."

However, and one word of warning would be, is that it is a long trek upward with over 200 stairs albeit they are quite gentle and not too steep and rightly enough, they do warn you of such before you pay. It did appear that there was a lift installation in progress to ease the passage.The walkways were good and there were some good information points/facts dotted about which provided further interest and we found all of the staff we came into contact with, very friendly and cheery.There are some great views from the top and included in the price is a visit to the engine rooms (at the end and below of the bridge itself) which was very interesting.We found it to be well worth a visit, great value for money and would highly recommend."

Surely the most stunning bridge in London, if not anywhere.Very interesting learning about the history and how it was built.The glass walk way gives you a very different perspective (if a little scary) on the view.Enjoyed by the whole family from 6 yr old to me (39).Brilliant couple of hours."

Its educational, thrilling to walk the glassed routeway above the Thames, fantastic views and you can marvel at the stunning engines in the steam room. Its 2 for1 when showing a national rail ticket. Great value. I also recommend finishing off the visit with a cuppa or a viewing on HMS Belfast. A great photo vantage poit of Tower Bridge."

You will have ALL your bags searched and have the contents emptied on to a table. This is a really slow process. The Towers look big from the outside but are huge inside. The steel structure is immense and open to see the workings. Wide stairs take you up to the viewing walkways, these have glass floors half way along. There is a lot of information but often where people pass so it is difficult to read. The graphics are very good but again is spoilt by people walking in front of the screens. You can also see the old steam engines in the basement of the south side tower. This is an interesting visit for anyone but at the end we still did not know how the original steam engines worked the cantilever roadways. To some extent the information was over complicated and became tedious and slightly boring."

It's much better than ground level which is a big smokey from the cars and crowded. My kids ((9,7,5,1) loved the glass bottom- bit worrying having a toddler bouncing up and down on the glass but the whole environment is safe feeling and wasn't too busy when I went (bet it gets busier though at peak times). Basically lots of people sprawl over the glass taking selfies.Some people walk around the edge rather than stand on the glass- you can do that. Lots of info up there and places to sit and chill.I liked it up there too. It is surprisingly high up (really!) and offers really good views both ways. I have been up the Shard to the top (really good on a clear day but super pricey) and still thought the view up here was pretty enjoyable. It is also very reasonably priced compared to other high experiences in London (I'd recommend over the London Eye for example which is over priced and over rated and huge Qs). Little in the way of stuff to do up the top of the Tower other than enjoy the views of the river and surrounding. What is interesting is to see the engine rooms (same ticket) which are at the foot of the bridge south side...if you're an engineer then you'll love it. These are the old original engines. You can't see today's engines. It's probably an hour in total - it's enclosed and warm- and maybe best mixed with a trip in the Tower or a walk along the South Bank."

We've traversed the Golden Gate, Brooklyn, Capilano Suspension Bridge, Bridge of Sighs, Rialto, pretty much every bridge between Paris' Left and Right Bank between the Eiffel Tower and the Marais, a few in Kyoto and Osaka, Chain and Liberty Bridges (Budapest), Charles Bridge (Prague), London Bridge, Millennium Bridge, etc, etc, etc. We just go looking for cool bridges to walk across when we visit a place. So, how can you go to London and not cross the Tower Bridge? I mean it seems that every single movie you see where London is the location, you get the gratuitous shot of Tower Bridge. Anyway, if you like walking and want to check out Southwark and the London that's on the other side of the Thames from where most tourists seem to go, cross over the Tower Bridge, head out over the bridge, walk along the embankment, have lunch at Borough Market, cross over Millennium Bridge. Just make a day of it if you can, particularly on a weekend day when the City seems to be less crowded. It's great to see and be part of history."

It is here that you can view the beautifully maintained steam engines, furnaces and accumulators that were once used in raising the moveable roadways at the bridge\u2019s centre. (These days the task is all done by electric motors). On the bridge itself visitor's can ascend the towers, via stairs or lifts, to high level walkways spanning the river and roadway below.

We enjoyed the Tower Bridge Experience.There are A LOT of steps to climb so you would need to be prepared for this when visiting.The views are lovely and the walkthroughs have lots of history about the creation of the bridge.The glass floor is at the centre of the walkway. There is a foot of non-glass floor around the edge if you are like me and not brave enough to walk over it! But you can still get some great photos and experience it by just looking over and through the glass. The views are lovely of the thames and along the river. Stretching up towards the city and down towards Greenwich. A great way to view london.Don't forget the engine rooms too. These hold the 2 main pumps that were used as well as the steam room where the power was held. Very informative and educational. "

Please be aware one lift in one side of tower bridge not working and it's over 200 steps to walk up !! You could of course cross road to other side of bridge & use lift there.

We went on a Tuesday, and did not have to queue to get in. There are 200 steps up the inside of the Tower which are a bit of a challenge! (There IS apparently a lift available but from a different place to the main entrance). Once we had climbed the steps there was a historical exhibition, on the top level. Then we walked across the top from one tower to the other. Half way along the corridor there were glass floor panels which were great but, a little un-nerving, when we stood in the middle of them. At that point you realise how high up you are! Then we went down the other tower and into the engine rooms and a large exhibition (a little bit further along the footpath). The \"exhibition/working museum\" was very interesting, and we learnt about the engineering needed when the bridge was built. They had a gift shop, selling quite nice souvenirs. A good experience and place to visit when in London, and very reasonably priced if you get the 2 for 1 prices deal. Also ideal for rainy days."

The attraction itself is reasonably priced for entry and the excitement from the kids as we approached was brilliant!The attraction itself when you think about it isn't actually that impressive ... It's literally entry, walk across the walkways and then visit the engine rooms of a bridge. That said, this is probably one of Londons most iconic landmarks and globally recognised so definitely worth a visit.The views are simply second to none and they have positioned Windows around for you to put cameras out of to ensure no reflection interference on the shot ... Nice touch!The interactive bits are a little lame and could do with some work although the glass floor is AMAZING!My kids loved those although even I have to confess at first it was a little weird and queezy stepping into them for the first time.Great fun though and an absolute must, especially if visiting London as a trip."

There are 206 steps to get to the top or there is a lift for people who can't walk very far or are in a wheelchair. Well worth the walk. Once up there there is a lot of information not just about Tower Bridge but also bridges in general and other famous types of bridge. Ie Clifton Suspension Bridge. Staff very helpful and pleasant. There is also interactive quizzes and an interactive film showing you how the bridge was made which lasts for 4 minutes and was very enjoyable. Can't wait to go again"

But this time .. it was absolutely different .. I was talking a walk in Shoreditch .. and then the City... and then .. following all signs .. I just walked to the Bridge .. The weather was fabulous, it was sunny and warm .. and Tower Bridge looked so wonderful .. so bright and simple at the same time! my cup of coffee and I enjoyed being there for at least one hour looking at the Bridge and thinking - Jesus, I AM at one of the most famous London attractions now! .. I guess it's all about the right moment. We're friends with that bridge now. Try it too for sure ;)"

There is a famous bus driver who once daringly drove his number 78 across the gap in the road as Tower Bridge was opening back in 1952! Recently there have been thick glass panels inserted into the upper walkways and its worth paying a few pounds to look down at the road / river through these from 137 feet above - not for the sqeamish though.There is an alternative! Catch a river clipper from, say, Greenwich and as you dock at the Tower the large, powerful boat slowly passes UNDER the road and you can look UP and see the scared people through the glass panels from below!!Never come to London and miss this most famous of landmarks.

Can't imagine what it's like in the summer as it was very busy in February. The highlight for most people is the glass floor through which you can see the bridge and river below. Not good if you have height or water phobias. You can walk around the edge of the glass .An interesting thing to do to kill an hour or so"

The tour takes you up to the top of the walk across the river and down to the original machinery in the cellars under the pavement. It was especially fascinating to see the huge hydraulic systems and quite charming the way the machines were painted in bright colours as to celebrate the technology. Our children were intrigued!"

Finally, the place which is so talked of and he place to visit once when u are in the city - Tower Bridge.Its an amazing place and located so perfectly that u wish to just stand there and watch the bridge. It's perfect for photography as well and will get to see loads of tourist around. Not sure about the timings of the bridge to open and close, but definitely a place to visit. I would assume it to much more happening at the time of it opening/closing.You can ho for a tour as well to see how it works and they also have a shop to buy some souvenirs for you to gift your love ones back home. Lots of places around to eat and amazing place yo walk as well.Enjoyy !!"

I often drive through the tower bridge and have seen the bridge go up and have always wanted to know what happens behind the scenes. Be prepared to walk up lots of flights of stairs when going into the exhibition, but the views were absolutely amazing. Theres lots of history behind it and it was so interesting they have videos to watch of how it was built too. Theres also an area where the floor is glass and u can take some preety cool pictures when you look down you see the traffic going through i loved it. Its a lovely day out for any couples family, i really had a lovely day out they even have a nice little souvenir shop after. Also when you come out you can walk down and theres a few restaurants and a few more shops to browse around in. If you are a tourist theres also a shop that sells souvenir items too. But if you are a londoner then i would also defo recommend to see this sight as it really is interesting to know about the history of your own city. They also have toilets in the tower bridge even when your climbing up those stairs."

We didn't buy the guide book (we have a shelf load at home gathering dust) on the assumption that there was adequate explanation for how the bridge works around the exhibit. We were, alas, left confused and disappointed - particularly in how the original boilers, steam engines, pumps and 'accumulators' raised and lowered the bridge. The explanation in the engine rooms was very poor. As we were walking around, I thought \"not to worry, I'll buy a book in the shop\". Double alas, the shop was full of London souvenir toot and very little to grab the attention of a middle aged curious traveller! My advice....buy the guide book and hope it explains more than the exhibit itself."

Our family (2 adults, 2 children) had spent several days in London and had a few hours to fill before returning home, so we decided to visit Tower Bridge.It cost \u00a320 for a 2+2 family ticket, and the whole experience took a couple of hours. There are quite a few steps to climb initially to reach the top of the North tower, and then you walk across the walkway to the other tower. Part of the walkway is a glass floor, which the children loved (but not the wife so much), and we spent ages on the walkway taking photos of the road/river through the glass floor and of the views along the river of the Shard, Gherkin, St Paul's, etc.You then descend the other tower, exit and walk to the engine rooms (ensure you retain ticket). The engine rooms contain machinery in pristine condition because the bridge roadway is rarely lifted these days (12 Mar, 05 Aug, 17 Sep in 2016).In summary, Tower Bridge is definitely worth a visit because it is an iconic landmark, has great history, great views and is great value."

It's a lot cheaper than most of the London attractions and has great views - definitely worth the price! The views are mainly of Canary Wharf, The Shard, The Gherkin and The Tower of London. There is an informative 5minute talk from the staff on the way up in the lift and when you enter the first section of the bridge. The top of the bride is actually enclosed so even if it is raining it would be a good attraction. The glass walk way is the main feature - look down on the passing traffic - IF YOU DARE!When you've climbed down all the stairs you can walk to the end of the bride along the pathway then your ticket includes entry to the engine room when preserved old engines are stored on display. It is very informative and a great attraction for all ages!A hidden gem, as few people seem to know you can go up the tower to cross the bridge."

No matter what you want, a stroll from Tower Hill underground, around the Tower of London, then across the Bridge to the Thames-side walkway, take in Shad Thames then along via the Golden Hind, Shakespeare's globe and the Tate Modern, before cruising the Millennium Bridge to St Paul's is perfect for anyone interested in the story of London.If you are lucky enough to be crossing when it raises up, then head for the barriers to get the vertigious experience of a road becoming vertical. The river looks amazing east or west, the views south and north.Head for the Tower Bridge Experience if you want to get inside the guts of it, climb across the uprights and walkways, peer down through the glass floors at pedestrians below, marvel at the engineering and scale. It's exciting, always.I've lived within five minutes of the Bridge for over 20 years and I feel excited every time I see it and walk over it.Classic, iconic: day or night, summer and winter"

Very friendly staff. Children get sticker books and stickers. Walked up to the walkways as lift not working...great exercise but lots of steps! Walkways were wider than we thought. Great views and lots to read. Glass floors were both scary and exciting and you can walk round them if you chicken out!! Upon leaving you follow a blue line over the bridge and down some stairs to the engine rooms. Interesting place with things for children to do. Great shop with lots to buy. Some pricey items but also cheaper items for the kiddies to get. Would recommend & visit again. "

They have photo booth upstairs, if you want your picture taken with the bridge as a souvenir. Great view day and/or night!"

There is lots to do round Tower Bridge - The Tower of London, cafes, restaurants etc. and its a nice area to just sit outside and take in the sites! We got on the Clipper boat here and got off at Embankment so got to see a lot of the sites that way - I highly recommend paying Tower Bridge a visit even if you don't go in the Tower of London and I recommend getting a Clipper Ticket! There was also signs up for free Jack The Ripper tours round this area which looked good but we had missed the last one - will definitely do one of these tours when we go back later in the year."

You mount the walkway above the bridge in a lift in the north tower, and then walk across the river. The big attraction is the glass floor, and it is indeed fun to look down and see miniature people crossing the bridge far below. Don't worry if you have vertigo - you can cross on a 'real' floor either side of the glass panels. The view is especially impressive to the east, towards Canary Wharf. To the west, most of the famous sites around Westminster are concealed round a bend in the river. After descending the south tower, hang onto your ticket and visit the engine rooms that powered the raising of the bridge; they are kept in immaculate condition. Throughout the tour there are information panels providing a comprehensive history of the bridge."

Planned a very special event in the Walkways... unfortunately the sole provider of catering and function services, Seasoned Events, really provided a shocking service and really proved that they are not a first class provider. 1. The Tower Bridge public address system playing in the background during the ceremony2. Messing up the table seating and separating partners and couples.3. Failing to manage DJ and wedding song upon entrance/exit and signing of register (no song at all on exit!)4. Not serving wines until AFTER the speeches and toasts!4. Bridal table dinner served after the first six tables and no wine/champagne for toasts."

Along the way you can take in the views of London Tower and Saint Pauls from the opposite bank. Stop and have a drink to take it all in. When you arrive at the bridge - climb to the top and walk across. Worth doing and not too difficult. From the top, you have great views looking back up river towards Parliament."

This iconic bridge can be easily accessed by Tube or Bus - its a few minutes' walk from the Tower Hill station on the District line. One can leisurely walk along the bridge- which is free- marvelling at the fascinating architecture of the bridge.To reach the walkways which are located some 40 metres high, you have to purchase a ticket for 8.00 GBP. The access to the walkways are through some elegant stairways. Halfway up there, you will come across a recreation of the Bridge design office which helps you to conjure up visions of an office environment more than a century back!. As you walk along the walkway, you will be taken aback as you hit the glass floor and catch sight of the vehicles and people passing by some 40 metres below! This is where most people spend their time and clamour to get photographs. As you cross over to the South side of the Bridge there is a small theatre of sorts where they show a short video film of about 5 minutes on the Tower Bridge construction which undoubtedly will impress almost everyone. Once you climb down, the Engine Rooms- which demonstrates the technology and the machinery that powered the Opening and Closing of the Bridge which definitely would have been an engineering marvel in 19th century!"

You can say it\u2019s just a bridge, but if you are looking to travel somewhere different, visit history and view intriguing architecture, the bridge speaks for itself. There is a lot going on from both sides of the bridge (check the spray painting blow up teapots picture), so the area compliments the iconic monument, fusing the old with the new.

There are also pictures of other famous bridges around the world along the walk. As a California native, I was excited to see that they showcased Sacramento and San Francisco's bridges! There's also this neat little machine where you can create post cards on the bridge. The admission price also comes with entrance to the engine room, where you can see how the bridge operates.

I've been here a few times (including riding over the bridge) and the new glass walkway is a nice (if terrifying) addition and you can easily go around it if you wish.The steam engines were impressive but i do miss the ability to visit the chamber where the end of the bridge swings down when it opens."

We bought 2 for 1 tickets through the national rail deal, so it cost us \u00a39 (adult ticket) for 2, which I think is a great deal.When we arrived there was a queue (due to having to go up via lift) and we went on a weekday, but it went down quickly. The lift took us up one of the towers to the walkways, where we were greeted by friendly staff explaining the history. Everyone ran off to view the see through walkway, but it's worth to stop to speak to the staff, which gave us more insight about the designs put forward for the bridge. We then wondered across the two walkways and I would recommend taking your time to read the history and watching the TV clips. Of course the see through sections were great to look through and make great photos! We left just as the sun was setting at 4:30, so it's ideal to visit at about 3:30pm on a clear day to catch it. We ended up in the other tower walking down the flight of stairs to go to the engine room, which is actually under the bridge. It's worth going to visit, as it's part of the ticket. The engine room is really fascinating and goes into detail about how they used water to create steam and hydraulic power to power the bridge."

The Tower Bridge, I reckon, would be one of the most recognisable sights on the planet (although most people would know it as London Bridge instead). lol We first saw it from London Bridge which is quite a distance away and as we walked closer, it was more and more majestic. In total, we would have taken at least 50 photos of the Tower Bridge. hahaA must see when in London..."

A trip to the Tower Bridge is a delightful experience for anyone who appreciates architectural aesthetics, engineering genius and historical significance. All 3 of these are spectacularly displayed through tactile & visual experiences. While climbing to the glass floored expanse of the bridge you are exposed to photos and written information regarding the history and significance of this edifice. There is a guide who will add additional information about its history and what to look for as you stroll over its expanse. Looking east & west over the Thames, you'll realize how important waterway it is. You'll also delight I the views of both sides of the river. You see the Globe Theater, Tate Modern Museum and St. Paul's Cathedral. But the real thrill is walking over the \"glass\" floor. You're looking down not only the river but the highway traffic crossing below. You have sense of \"floating\" as you navigate the glass under your feet. Another marvel is the engine room, a definite must see."

For thrill seekers, there is a section of walkway that has been replaced by glass, so you can step out high over the river. For non-thrill seekers, you can easily walk around. The displays are well done and interesting. There is a great one about famous and intriguing bridges around the world. A cool feature - there are these small windows that open so that you take unobstructed photos of the beautiful views. We visited this after spending most of the day at the London Tower. Easy to do because of the proximity. There are no restrooms at the entrance, but there are once you get inside."

The recent introduction of glass floor areas in these sections gives a different but slightly nervous viewpoint looking down onto the road and river below. A helpful tip if you are brave enough to lay down on the glass and take a picture of yourself and others using the mirror mounted above is remove any loose change you have in your pocket. It is surprising how change falling out of your pocket onto the glass sounds just like glass cracking. Very amusing for others to watch three people move as quick as they did.

The bridge is lovely, the environment around at has a lot of landmarks to add to your list, and the grass area, pretty good in summer."

There is a lift that takes you to the high level walkway and the nice young man operating the lift gave us a quick brief to the bridge and what to expect and he told us that the lift in the opposite tower that takes you down was out of order so you could either walk down or go back down in the same lift (with my dodgy knees thats what I did). the views from the top of the bridge are spectacular and the amount of famous sights from there was amazing including the Shard, the Monument, City Hall, The Tower, etc..the engine room was facinating with the steam engines working (although not by steam anymore) and there were videos to watch that gave you the history of the bridge. All In all a facinating and historic look at a Famous London Landmark, would go again if family come to visit."

Unfortunately, was not able to go inside the exhibition due to lack of time. It was summer when I went here and there were mobile restaurants near the bridge. One of them served the best mojito I have ever had.Lovely area."

There's also an application where you can see the bridge actually rising! The only disappointing fact is that from the array of bridges from around the world that are depicted on the walls of the upper floor the Greek Rio-Antirrio bridge is missing.

It was a clear sunny day and we got good views of Canary Wharf and the shard. Midway across there is a glass floor so you can see traffic and the river below. Plenty of history about the bridge and how the opening works. Make sure you walk across both walkways they both have glass floors the second one wasn't as busy when we were there.

There is a great spot on the bridge for pictures, which provides a panoramic view of the Thames. There is also a sign explaining all of the buildings that are visible! It's very easy to walk a cross, with pedestrian sidewalks that are protected from traffic. It's fantastic during the day, but definitely worth seeing lit up at night! and be sure to look up the schedule for when the drawbridge opens! It opens at least once a day, but occasionally more depending on the boats needing to access the river."

The first is on foot from a distance from the side of the Thames River below the bridge on the same side as the Tower of London. This is the best for photography esp. at night. The second way is from a car driven very slowly across the bridge and take a photo every few meters. Then study the details before returning to the bridge on foot. The third is on a cruise boat on the River Thames and one gets to see the bridge on both sides, twice. We have done all three, and continues to find different things on the Bridge we haven't seen. I would like to try again, next time by double decker bus, and take photos of the River Thames from the Bridge riding the bus. I still remain excited."

It is what you make of it, it costs nothing to visit, but ultimately it's a bit of fancy road crossing a brown and murky river.Take a selfie with it, tell people you came here, and please please please remember it's call Tower Bridge.

The elevation provides for an excellent view of the Tower of London, the HMS Belfast, and other sites up and down the Thames River. This is still a working draw bridge, I would recommend checking the opening schedule and time your tour so you can watch the opening and the vessels passing through the glass floor from above (most openings are on Saturday).There is a combo ticket purchase that will save you a few pounds by buying a ticket to the Tower Bridge and the Monument, which is a short walk from the bridge. Your ticket also gains you access to the engine room to see how the bridge operates. Definitely plan a couple of hours to fully appreciate the experience.There is a nice exhibit in the tower dedicated to unique bridges from around the world."

The staff there were very welcoming, gave us necessary information like what time the bridge would open that day. We went all the way up and walked the bridge, and it does give you temporary jitters when you look down to the busy traffic through the glass floor. The exhibition was very educational, and despite our dismal knowledge of energy conversion, we marvelled at the engineering and the people behind the operation of the bridge. A typical walk around takes about an hour and a half, and we stopped by the Christmas markets nearby to fuel up. Pity we didn't have a chance to see the bridge in the day though, we are sure it will be magnificent as well"

And if you're lucky you'll get to see the bridge opening.

I expected it to be just a walk way but there were alot of information on the bridge and other interesting bridges all around the world. My daughter got really excited over the 'glass' walkway which allowed her to see to the street level below.Do take your time to watch the videos along the walkway as they will explain to you how the bridge works and there is also a screen to inform you when the bride will open during the next couple of days. We went around sunset and managed to catch spectacular views of Tower of London as the skys changed from light to dark. There are also small windows that allow you to stick your camera out to take better pictures of River Thames."

Exciting!The views were the best part. All around the Thames from high above the bridge. Not to mention 2 different places where the floor has been cut out and replaced with glass, so you can walk above the road and water below.The way the history of the bridge was presented was disappointing. It was summarized information presented multiple times in different areas. Always the same, never even worded differently. I say, if you don't have much to say about the bridge, then just say what you can and play on what you've got. The views, the raising of the bridge, play it up and make it seem like the best bridge in the world! That's what I thought when I entered the bridge...As a university student, the engine rooms didn't do anything for me. Sure not everyone knows what steam and hydroelectric power are, some schools probably find it very useful, but I learned all of that years ago. The coolest part there was the scale of the machines.Tower Bridge is relatively cheap and give a neat perspective on the city. They need to improve their information centers and play with what they've got, but not bad at all.I'd say definitely worth a look if you're in the area."

If you choose to do this, I encourage you to download the free Raise Tower Bridge app. Once up on the walkway, you point your phone at the Raise Tower Bridge poster (on floor) and watch a simulation of the bridge being raised as if you are watching it through the glass floor. It was pretty cool! You can also check the schedule of when there will be an actual bridge lift so you can watch it live though I do not know if you can see it from the walkway during the lift. We visited in early November in the late afternoon and had no wait. We bought our tickets at the bridge although you can purchase them online in advance. There was a steady handful of tourists on the walkway. Due to our limited time, we were only interested in experiencing the Glass Walkway so we did not complete the actual Tower Bridge Exhibition Tour. You must walk down one side of the bridge and then back the other in order to exit via the elevator. You will miss the Gift Shop if you skip the Engine Room part of the tour. For security reasons, fast track entry may not be available. Once we got up to the Glass Walkway, it was fun watching different peoples reaction to standing on the glass. Some would not step on it at all while others had no fear. We were able to get a Bridge employee to take our picture as we squatted low on the glass so he could get both us and traffic below in the photo. In addition to taking photos, I took some videos to give my friends a better idea of what it was actually like watching the traffic move below while seeing people's feet as they walk across the glass. I will tell you that we enjoyed this experience very much and highly recommend it. We walked over from the Tower Hill Underground Station after a nice man pointed us in the right direction to exit the station. Once we got to the Bridge, we just followed the signs."

You can pay to go up the towers although I think just the view of the bridge from the North or South Thames embankments is good enough, especially when lit up at night. If you're really lucky, you may be on or near the bridge when the road closes and the bascules lift, which I still find exciting to watch. Just Marvellous."

Make sure you stay long enough to see the bridge lifting. Be warned - it gets packed when that happens, so you need to be there in time to get a good view. If you miss the bridge lifting, it won't be long before it happens again. Just ask one of the guides working there. They will be able to tell you. If you're scared of heights, you can walk around the edge of the glass panelled section.If you haven't seen Monument, ask about a joint ticket. It's only about \u00a31-\u00a32 more, but then you get to see two attractions almost for the price of one."

As iconic as the British Parliament and the London Eye, the Tower Bridge is yet another recognizable symbol for the British capital. If you didn't witness it, you probably didn't know that it's also a movable bridge!Constructed in the late 1800s, the Tower Bridge was built as both a bascule (movable bridge) and a suspension bridge which the cables are linked to the namesake towers. The walkways between the towers were meant for pedestrians when the bridge was up, but because of the hassle that involved moving up and then down, people rather wait for the bridge to go down again. Hence, the walkway was virtually abandoned...until it became a tourist attraction!The walkway exhibit shows the history of the Tower Bridge with its facts and data and the roster of impressive bridges around the world. Aside from the great view of the Thames east and west of the bridge, a small part of the walkway floor is also glass! Your admission also includes the engine room that has an imitation engine, which shows how the drawbridge works, so you can see that aside from being a beautiful icon, Tower Bridge is also an engineering fest!This is a quick stop that can be finished in an hour or less for only \u00a39, but it is nonetheless a site that I would highly recommend visiting as a London tourist especially before or after your Tower of London trip!---tl;dr version:1) Walkway exhibit of Tower Bridge history and other bridges in the world2) Great view of the Thames and even a glass walkway portion3) Highly recommended short stop especially with Tower of London"

The hardest part of the tour involved us being crammed into a lift with many other visitors to be taken to the upper gantry of the bridge to begin the self-guided tour. There are no audio guides provided, instead you simply wander around reading the information boards and taking the views as you go. One of the highlights of the tour was walking across the glass-bottomed walkway on the upper gantry. You look straight down on the bridge\u2019s roadway directly below you, with the river flowing under it.The final part of the tour took us down to the road level and then down into the engine room in one of the towers, below the road level. Here, we were able to view the steam engines which originally operated the mechanism used to lift the roadway sections of the bridge, to allow ships to pass.At this point our tour was cut slightly short, when an announcement came over the public address system that all visitors to the bridge needed to evacuate the bridge immediately. Apparently there was some kind of security threat! We therefore had no alternative at that stage but to leave the bridge. We were fortunate that we had virtually completed our tour. Others were not so lucky, as they had only just begun their tours.The Tower Bridge tour is a good experience which provides the visitor with some unique views and experience. Good stuff!"

Engine room tour was made interesting by in period cast members acting out the run up to the opening ceremony, nope they keep this feature as it was informative and entertaining for all ages, need to have a video of the bridge working, 1 to show it opening and 1 to show the mechanics that make it happen, kids will probably enjoy this attraction."

I decided to take the stairs to get a little workout in lol It was only about a couple minute walk up but I wouldn't recommend it if you get tired fast When you get to the top, you can sit down and watch a video that describes the designing and building of the Tower Bridge. Next, you start the walk across. The walk has signs and pictures of the history of the bridge and how it stands today. The coolest part, besides the view of the city, is the glass floor. You can see straight down which was cool. Some people were scared but trust me, it's completely safe.When you finish the bridge, head to the railings by the road which is a nice picture spot to take of you and the bridge."

We walked, sat and lay on the floor for photos and even a member of staff took some for us. We really enjoyed it and such good value. You can spend as long as you like then follow the blue line to the engine room which again was interesting."

I am a walk, a stair climber but walking to the top of this structure was a test of my endurance! Like a million steps (and elevator down). But the view is magnificent and the glimpse into the Victorian structure that opens the bridge for boats is beautiful (all cast iron, steel, and bright paint). Great place to get a great view of the city and the river. Full of history, great place to get a bit of London history. Of all the times I have visited London, I am ashamed to say I never went to Tower Bridge!! Now I would not skip seeing it. Quite a sight. It is a pretty tough walk the top. There are landings inbetween the winding stairways to catch your breath. I am sure if you are not in mood to walk all the steps you can use the elevator? Will not hurt to ask. Worth the effort to get the view."

There was a queue, but we got to the payment counter quickly where I bought a discounted family ticket for one adult and two children. We took the lift to the top floor where there were pictures of different types of bridges around the world and info about them. Here is where the scary transparency glass floor looking down onto the bridge and the Thames is located. If you were too scared to walk on the glass, there was the option of using the rabbit runways at the side of the glass walkway. I managed to sum up courage to walk through the entire glass walkway and to encourage my 9 year old to do the same. The 15 year old refused, but did stand in one spot on the glass for a few seconds before skipping back to the rabbit runways. Lots of tourists were on the glass taking photos.There was the option of getting back down to visit the museum by lift or taking the stairs. On the stairs there were plaques giving further information about the history of the bridge. At the top of the ceiling on the next floor down, there were models of workmen depicting what it would have been like to work on the construction of the bridge. There was an animated film showing a speed-up version of the construction of the bridge from start to finish.The museum downstairs had the original engine rooms, cisterns, wheels, etc. explaining what went into lifting the bridge for tall ships. There was a small cinema showing a film on the history of maintaining the bridge, and some activities for the kids to draw and pull/turn knobs, as well as a digital quiz. This section lead to the usual gifts/mementos shop."

I eneded up by accident in the area that the Tower Bridge was and I was pleasantly surprised. First off the area that the bridge is very unique. There are very old buildings and then you have modern architect, amazing. I had initially said to myself I was not walking all the way over the bridge, I had been walking for hours. But it calls to you and I finally decided to take the walk over the bridge and I am so glad that I did. Its not just the bridge its the view from the bridge, its the people on the bridge... its whats on the other side of the bridge. I was so amazed the bridge itself is beautiful and an actual working bridge. Take you time stop and look and you will get a different view of London. On the other side is the Tower of London where the Crown Jewels. There is also a cute food truck area that is actually VW Vans. Then continue on to Big Ben, you see the London Tower Bridge is your gateway to some exciting things, so just take the walk, you will be glad you did."

No matter the traffic or season, the suspended glass walkway connecting the Tower exhibits to the engine rooms are an exciting journey above the motor road which bascules open up for river vessels to pass by. Not only the Shard or the Gherkin is a great view from the bridge, the bridge's side aisles consisting of pubs, cafes and offices is a nostalgic walk of the old and new together. Either sides, the Tower Hill or London Bridge tube stations are situated and are well connected to most other tube/train lines. The epic 1000year old historical Tower of London is also just across the Thames for another venture of the past to be explored."

From 2015 they have a new viewing platform through which you are able to see the street, water and bridge under it. The platform is very strong and is able to sustain 5000 kg pressure power. So I think it is very safe. They are now also testing this platform in case something like a phone, tablet or laptop hits it, as this might slowly crack it. In this bridge I managed to see many other pictures with other famous bridges around the world including the Golden Gate bridge. Also you can understand how the bridge was created and hear some speeches between queen Victoria and the bridge architect. Tower Bridge is the most known bridge in the world. He has an impressive and difficult opening procedure to make every time a tall boat crosses under it, and he needs to open. The views from the bridge are extraordinary. Actually that is the best part. I should have spent more time looking at the views. You can see Gerkin, the financial centre, Shard, etc. Underneeth is very scary to watch, but I had to do it. Then I got used to the view. People underneath would never realise that we are looking at them. Its soo cool when the bridge opens. It feels like you are going to fall and die. But actually staying on the plexiglass is safer than on the wooden part. You even realise about the existence of the Butlers Wharf. 432 men were employed to build the Bridge. I even heard about the Moses Bridge, which crosses the water, in a strange way."

After doing a lap of the bridge at road level we went to the ticketing office to see if it was still open and were pretty much the last to enter, although it was closing we weren't rushed at all and in fact were encouraged to take as much time as we wanted, which was a good start. The tickets were also reasonably priced for London. The tour is basically up one tower, across the walkway and down the other tower finishing with a trip around the original engine room. Throughout the tour there are videos and information points about how and why the bridge was built, including information about other bridges in the world throughout. In the centre of the walkway there are glass panels you can stand on to look down at the water and road below. It was foggy when we went up so a limited view, although the bridge did open so we got to see it in action, which was good. Worth a visit to see one of the iconic London landmarks at a reasonable price."

The visit allows you to go up to the walkways between the two 'towers' where there is some information about the history of the bridge, the technology behind it and offers some amazing views of London - even on a rainy day! The glass sections in the floor offer a bit of an adrenaline buzz - even though you know you are perfectly safe! The interpretation was a little dated and could do with sprucing up a bit, but it was simple and to the point. Great value price if you have travelled by train via the Days Out website (2 for 1 on tickets to many attractions)."

Next time I visit I will want to take the tour as I am sure it it worth the price of admission. This is a must see, especially at night while in London."

It is worth checking before you visit so you can witness the Bridge opening to allow a tall boat to go through as this only happens as and when there is a boat wishing to pass. It is thrilling when you do see it and it can be viewed rather well from the Tower of London. Photographers have a ball on this Bridge, there are so many wonderful angles to capture of the Bridge itself and it surroundings - a very special place. Tour tip: Visit the tower of London, then walk over Tower Bridge and visit HMS Belfast which is moored on the South side of the River Thames, a 3 in 1!"

After visiting the Tower of London, my wife and I did the Tower Bridge Exhibition (bought at a discounted combined ticket rate), which was only a short walk away. It was late afternoon, so no real queue to get in and we waited to access the lift (this takes about 25 people) to the first walkway level although if you don't want to wait there's stairs. This section has an introductory briefing on the bridge and its construction, then it's off to the walkways, which include large \"glass\" panes providing a vertical view of the bridge traffic and the Thames. Along the inner side, there's descriptions of other iconic bridges from around the world, with the other side open to provide views out to the river. Walking around to the other walkway, it's basically the same, with another glass panel, more additional bridge descriptions and an opposite side view up/down?? the river. After descending, there's a short walk outside to enter and view the engine room which provides an historic overview of the original steam driven machinery operating the bridge opening mechanisms. As it was by now about 5 o'clock, we walked along the embankment and watched the Tower light up as the sun set and dusk/evening set in - marvellous views."

This is an engineering feat.It reminded me of the bridge that I onced walked between Niagara Falls in Canada and Buffalo, New York. The Peace Bridge was impressive because of the roaring and rushing falls. The Tower Bridge conveniently adjacent to the Tower of London stimulated a similar experience and sensation.This is not any old bridge. It is formidable civil engineering from afar and in close proximity. When a bridge is built, it is to connect two banks across a river. It is a way to cross a body of water. It is functional. It serves a pragmatic purpose. Not so at the Tower Bridge. It is magnificent. It is splendiferous. It is dazzling. It is art. The bridge lured me even when I was miles away. I was mistaken when I initially thought that it was the London Bridge of the famous nursery rhyme, \"London Bridge is Falling Down.\" I was permitted to cross the Tower Bridge! I was over the moon when I discovered that I was allowed without charge or other restrictions. I am glad that I took time to slowly walk across and back again. To get a sense and feel of the place, I investigated every piece of steel, rod, cable, and rock that suspended the bridge. I did not want to forget.Even if crowds and traffic had to be contended, it was a worthwhile adventure. Since I was out in the cool open fresh air with wind blowing in my hair, the excited people and whizzing cars were not intimidating or punitive or annoying. This was insignificant compared to the senses that the bridge evoked.All I saw was the awesome engineering, views of the Thames River, and parts of London. Many \"Kodak\" opportunities. Hundreds of tourists from every corner of the world were doing the same thing posing and taking selfies. I joined them in their pleasure. Carpe diem!"

There is a glass walkway that spans the top of the Tower Bridge end to end, and that is what you pay admission to travel through. Along the span is information and videos about the building of the bridge, london, and other bridges around the world. The floor is transparent in many sections affording a unique view below of the river and bridge opening. We were able to witness, through the glass floor, the bridge opening and a tugboat leading a sightseeing cruise through the bridge.Very fun."

It is closed in - but does have cool glass floors that you can walk over and look down on the hustle below. It's in a very vibrant part of the city with great pubs and restaurants near buy. The London Tower is right next to the bridge. Took the elevator up and walked the stairs down. We also took one of the river cruises under the bridge which made for a great photo op and the sky line and bridge were beautiful."

While walking across, My wife and I decided to go and have a look around.Queuing to pay was only a couple of minutes.A quick search of women's handbags later and we were through.You have the option of a lift or stairs.Be prepared if you took the stairs option like we did.There are around 220 stairs in total, and seemed like we were walking up them for half an hour lol.Although you do get to see the inner structure from the taking the stairs rather than a metal box to go up in :DNext time I'd probably take the lift up, and the stairs down lol.Once up there, there is a guide that will give you some history on the bridge, and some tv's with a short program on the building of it etc. This is also has subtitles for various languages.Whilst walking along the top of the bridge there is some glass flooring that you can stand on and look down to the people, and boats etc under the bridge.You can download an app for your smartphone called raisingthebridge.This app couple with the postage shown inside the bridge shows the bridge opening etc.Worth downloading, only a small app, or download before you go.Worth a visit for the time your in there for.You also get to go and view the old steam mechanics that open the bridge.This is a short distance outside and down the stairs.Just follow the blue line :D"

What was very lucky when we went was that the bridge opened when we was up there amazing . Then you can walk on the other side which was a lot less crowded . Down the lift out of the bridge follow the blue line to the engine room ,it was ok worth the trip"

Go first to the Tower of London, then Tower Bridge. They have added glass floors on the walkways above and it is very surreal to be standing on them and looking at the people and autos traveling below. They have a wonderful exhibit on famous bridges and I recommend taking the time to read them. Some have a wonderful history and many of the designers are names we have heard before. The views are wonderful from up there also. Take the extra 15 minutes to go to the engine room and see how this bridge works. I came here before many years ago and they had a much clearer demonstration on how the bridge was built and how it works. It is no longer there and I think that it is a major loss. The cost is reasonable, the views are incredible, and it is simply beautiful."

My only disapointment was that the lift was not working. I could not face climbing all these stairs. I was however advised that there was another lift, at the other side of the bridge. This meant walking right across the bridge, and a bit further, then crossing the road and walking back. The lift I got is normally only used for bringing people back down, so the lift attendant was rather confused when I said I wanted to go up.It was however worth all the hassle. There is an interesting exhibition at the top, of bridges all over the world. There is a glass floor at each side, which you really should walk over, even it you do feel slightly squeemish. The views however are wonderful. After taking quite a few photos, I noticed someone opening one of the small sliding windows, so after that there was no stopping me.On the return you ground level you walk a bit further, and you can visit the engine room. This is quite an amazing feet of engineering. Unfortunately there were no bridge lifts planned for the day I was there, so I missed that spectacular, but it is definitely worth a visit."

It took a minute to get used to but after that, it was so fun. There was a school group there and watching the little kids on the floor was so fun. The views were pretty good, could have been better but the weather didn't work out. I can't imagine our time in London without it!"

After doing the Tower of London, it's hard not to walk around the Tower Bridge, and after reading about the glass walkway, I knew I was going to go up. My sister is very afraid of heights and didn't want to go, and I'm not a huge fan either, but I had no problems with the walkway (there is wood flooring on the outskirts of the panels, so if you don't want to walk on the glass, you don't have to). There's also open port holes on the windows to the outside so you can stick your camera out and get some nice photographs. If you're interested in bridge architecture, there's plenty of information both on Tower Bridge and others around the world. The Engine room was a bit of an added bonus and worth the walk if you've already paid entry.This is a pretty unique thing to be able to do, despite all the tourists, and it's cheap, so why not add it to your itinerary?"

We thought Tower Bridge was very striking to look at, and we enjoyed seeing it from many different angles.To see the Tower Bridge Exhibition, follow the signs to enter at the northwest tower, then go up to the glass walkways between the towers. The views of London are wonderful, but it's not easy to get great photos because of all the glass. The exhibit leads you down into the original engine room that powered the bridge lifts.We weren't terribly impressed with the exhibition, and standing on its glass walkway didn't seem exciting compared to the glass walkway that we had just walked on at the Eiffel Tower the week before. We were glad that we hadn't paid extra for this attraction, because it was included in our London Pass.Tip: Check their website for bridge lift times (when the bridge deck opens up to let ships pass through)."

So if you do have the opportunity to take a train, please ask about the voucher. You'd need that And all your passenger tickets to get tickets at half the price. It is also fine to view it along river Thames.. It is too beautiful to miss. But there are always loads of people around so vigilant on the most opportune time to click a pic ;)"

Save on the entry fee by having a 2 for 1 offer (see our review of Tower of London forcwhat this is).It's probably pot luck if you are there just before the bridge opens, but if you are, view the opening through the glass floor above the roadway - very spectacular.After the exhibits up high over the roadway, catch the lift back down to street level and continue walking north along the bridge to the other side where you can visit the bridge's old engine room to see the steam powered machinery which used to raise the bridge."

We took the stairs to the top which was rather interesting although tiering. However there are lifts which are maned by a helpful assistant. Once at the top there is interesting information about the bridge and how it was built etc. There are no time slots so it depends on what time and what day you go , to how busy it is. We went on a Saturday about midday. It was fairly busy but not too bad. There are great views of the Thames and the iconic buildings that edge the river and the skyline like the Shard. The glass floor is really good however I feel it should be longer as many people want to walk on it an take pictures and having the fascination of being able to look down onto the traffic, people and the passing boats below you need time. You feel you have to hurry along as there are other people also wanting to look.All in all I would recommend it as it is a good experience."

The bridge opened while we were on the catwalk and it was an amazing view. I'm terrified of heights, so for those of you like me, know that the catwalk is enclosed with glass and there are areas you can walk around the glass floor window, the whole catwalk is NOT glass and you will feel secure and be fine. I highly recommend going up the towers to the catwalk, it was a nice view and and very lovely experience. Did I say, I LOVE London??!!! :-)"

The history of how it was built is really interesting and it did make my children listen as it was a fairly short and easy listening with a video playing in the background which was perfect as my children did ask why we were bothering to go and look at the bridge. Nice pieces of artwork are on display which was nice to look at. Def worth a visit!"

You can lose yourself in the majesty of the structure, or you can marvel at the engineering behind the mechanisms that lift the huge road decks. It's iconic and deserves to me. Everyone thinks it's 'London Bridge' and it kind of should be, but it's not. Take a bus over the bridge, any busy, and enjoy the staggering views. If you travel in the back of a car, lie back, look out and up from the rear window, and be dazzled by the spectacle that passes above you.The Tower of London end of the bridge is perfectly safe. The south side of the bridge is less safe when it is late and dark. This would not stop me going there, but just remember to keep your wits about you if you visit late.Oh, it's best view late when it's dark lol"

The views were great and it was possible to open some of the little windows to take photos although those taken through the glass were fine.

Lots of information about bridge design and bridges around the world. The staff/guides were friendly and v helpful (although the young lady at the ticket desk was a bit grumpy).

Whether viewing from a distance, bus tour, walking over it or visiting the inside museum it has impressive views from every angle. On this visit we did the museum visit, priced at \u00a39 pp but we had a 241 offer. It passes an hour or so but isn't the kind of place you can spend a day. Included in the tour was a talk on the design of the bridge, a walk over the two walkways including a glass floor section and a visit to the engine rooms. I enjoyed it but I am pleased we paid 241 as I do feel they could make more out of it. More about the workers, exactly how it was made. It seems the experience relies on the impressive structure and not much info is given other than a few photos. A good way to pass an hour or so but don't go with really high expectations. The glass floor is a must."

I had walked under the bridge before and have seen the raising of the bridge but this time around I bought tickets to go up and I am glad I did. For two people it was 18.00 and instead of taking the elevator we decided to walk the stairs. It wasn't that bad but don't do it if you're prone to getting short of breath!Once you get to the top there was staff to give some insight into the area you arrive at. But once you go to the center of the bridge you can get a nice thrill by walking on the glass floor. I have a new respect for heights now and the entry fee was worth the excitement. I am not sure if you can watch the raising of the bridge from the glass floor, I am sure you can and I can only imagine how awesome that would be. Just because it is such a common tourist site does not mean someone should avoid taking the time and money to enjoy it."

Tower Bridge, often misidentified as \"London Bridge\" is definitely worth a visit, particularly if you are a first time visitor to London. It's one of those iconic structures that comes to mind when you think of images of London.  You can easily enjoy this in about two hours. Go on a sunny day so that you may enjoy the view and see it in all it's glory. Tower Bridge is visually attractive because of its wonderful architecture and it's also quite interesting in terms of engineering. We happened to be there at a time when they were lifting the bridge for some taller marine traffic that was making its way down the river. Go enjoy the video presentation upstairs and look at some of the original equipment that used to raise the bridge. In addition, there's a silly bit of fun to be had when you go up to the top level of the bridge and stroll across a part of the floor that is clear plexiglass. Now, you know that you won't fall through because killing tourists would be bad for business, but it is still quite eery to be looking between your feet and seeing the cars passing way below.  Tower Bridge is one of the attractions that are included with The London Pass. This means that you do not pay admission when you get there and you can also jump on a relatively short line to take the elevator up instead of waiting in the much longer line of people who are purchasing tickets. If you want to hit all the tourist spots, save some money and not go through the process of paying as you go, this is a no brainer.  You may easily combine your visit to Tower Bridge with a boat ride up the Thames River and/or a visit to the nearby Tower of London so that you can see the crown jewels. The Tower of London is within walking distance of the bridge. By the way... on the way up the river, you can see the actual London Bridge, which is a very plain looking bridge and nothing special to see. It's fun, though, knowing that you are seeing the actual \"London Bridge.\" Fortunately, it was not falling down.  As first timers in London, we had a great time at Tower Bridge and you should too."

Since my family and I last visited here three years ago, glass panels have been added to the floors of the overhead East and West walkways, which have greatly enhanced the experience. The walkways can be reached by lifts in both towers.There are notices advising the times when the bridge will be opened to allow a ship to pass, and we were able to enjoy this experience. It is interesting to be able to look down on the passing traffic and the constant stream of pedestrians, when the bridge is open to traffic. We were particularly interested to see the hydrogen cylinders on the tops of the new hydrogen-powered double-decker buses.Before the bridge opens a warning siren is sounded and the traffic brought to a halt. The two halves of the bridge deck then start to open and you can clearly see the four twelve inch bolts, which lock them into place, when the roadway is open to traffic.You are then able to look down on the ship as it passes below.  You are also able to visit the excellently preserved steam engines, and the associated boilers and pumps which used to power the opening mechanism. These are situated in the engine room under the South side of the bridge.We found all of the staff welcoming and informative and I thoroughly recommend the experience."

To cross it is free, if you want to go into the exhibition that's when you pay. If you do manage to see this site on a beautiful day the views of London that you will see are unreal. The sights that you will see are where historic buildings meet modern architecture which makes you excited to be in London.

It's not only a London icon but the feeling of being above the Thames looking down the river watching the buzz of London pass by is a truly special experience (even if you cross it over and over). This bridge is huge and tends to get crowded with pedestrians in the summer months but its worth taking your time to cross and enjoy the view. To walk across the bridge can be entered either north of the river by the Tower of London (worth visiting at least once in a lifetime) or from south of the river off Tooley Street. I would suggest making a fun day of the visit to Tower Bridge: lower cost outing would be a walk across the bridge with plenty of stops for pictures (make sure you get the Tower of London in the background!). To the north is the Tower of London, to the east is Canary Wharf, to the west is London Bridge, Blackfriars Bridge, St Paul's Cathedral and a little further down is Big Ben. You can also enter the Tower for a fee.Whether you being or end on the south side of the river, be sure to walk past London's City Hall and visit Hays Galleria (I'm told that was the first site of refrigeration in London during the days when the Thames was carrying a thriving shipping industry). At Hayes Galleria there are now some coffee shops and places to eat. There is also an area called 'More London' on the walk down the south bank closer to London Bridge which puts on various outdoor activities for free in the summer: films, concerts, beachside seating areas etc."

It was so interesting hearing about how they came up with the design of the bridge. Then last month I visited again. First of all, it was much more crowded than the last time I went plus the exhibits really changed. They now have a section of the floor that is glass so you can see the road or river below. So many people were trying to get pictures there that you could hardly pass by. There was a brief presentation at the beginning that touched on why London needed a bridge like this and there was another video towards the end. What I missed most was the presentation they use to do at the end where you felt like you were there the day the bridge opened. Even though things changed, it is still an interesting place to visit if you have the time."

This has allowed me to view the Tower bridge from numerous points of views with all types of weather and all hours of the day. Not surprisingly Tower bridge is at its best very early in the morning, looking at it from the east, so that the rising sun hits it directly and at night when it is fully lit. It is definitely worth coming to East London to see the Tower and Tower bridge. Pass to the south bank and walk from Tower Bridge westbound. It is a wonderful stroll and you can see a number of iconic buildings on your way."

If you time your visit correctly you can see the bridge open and close. Check the Tower Bridge site or their Facebook page. The attraction does cost to enter, we opted for the London Pass. We purchased this on a travel site at a discounted price. There is an elevator for those not able to climb the spiral staircase. There are attendants everywhere. Talk to them, they will give you the history of the bridge. On both walkways at the top there is a section where the floor is see through. You can walk on the floor, or walk around. While we were there several young women were sitting on the floor talking selfies with the bridge traffic below them. Also, follow the line to the engine room. The machinery used to operate the drawbridge is awesome."

But at the end of it, you felt very \"meh\". Seeing the raising of the bridge for cruise ships etc was a more enjoyable highlight, but that doesn't happen all the time and you have to check ahead for the scheduled time to ensure you don't miss it. Taking pictures of the bridge, especially at night, is a great experience as it really is visually stunning. However, overall, it's just okay."

Didn't have time for The Monument but the ticket is good for 7 days. Although it was a Saturday and lots of Tourists around you are not hurried or hassled. History of the construction is well documented and when you arrive at the walkways the views up and down river are great, The glass panels form about 6 metres and there is a narrow walkway alongside for those of a nervous disposition. We were fortunate that a boat was due under the Bridge necessitating it to be opened, good view through the glass panels. The visit is finished off with a visit to the Engine Rooms to see the magnificent machinery needed to raise and lower the Bridge, Good Visit, well wort it."

I expected 'ho-hum' but was pleasantly surprised to be very interested in everything this attraction had to offer. Despite the fact that we were both quite tired by this point in the day, we were intrigued by the whole tour. I did not think I would like the overhead part of the journey through the bridge (height issues) but I was fascinated - even with the glass floor part. This is a well-conceived tour. In hindsight, we might have done this earlier in our day but nevertheless recommend it highly to all London visitors."

A good number of small windows were open so you can get good photos both up and down stream. I got a good shot, through the floor, of an Open Top Tour bus crossing the Bridge. Plenty of slide and film shows as well as authentic displays to look at. The tour of the Engine Rooms, down below, provides the icing on the cake.

You also can visit independently. It is worth a stop after visiting the Tower of London. Just follow the the promenade turning left after you exit the Tower and go under the bridge and around to the left to the road that is perpendicular to the promenade and leads over the bridge. Stay on the right side going onto the bridge footpath and you will see an entry sign for the exhibit. There is an admission charge if not with the Pass. You are taken up in an elevator, view a short film about the history of the bridge and its chief architect, then get to walk onto the bridge and across it on two sides. There are beautiful views of the Thames and London in all directions. A nice surprise is the \"see through\" flooring like at the CN Tower in Toronto that allows you to look directly below on traffic and the river. You can visit the steam pump room too. Learn about bridge construction, take some great photos from on high and read about and see photos of other bridges around the world. When exiting on the south bank side of the river you can either walk back to the Tower of London side or keep walking off the bridge, to the right and down the south bank towards London Bridge where you will get more eye popping views of London and the Thames and see HMS Belfast docked in the river. Adults and families will enjoy this."

Have A walk over Tower Bridge Also as the views of London are spectacular.A tour of The Tower is a must and take your time as their is so much to see.especially with historical content of interest.I suggest you take a packed lunch as the queues for food were lengthy and a visit to The Gift Shop is well worth a visit with a great selection especially for children."

It's cool, it's the bridge that everyone always confuses with \"London Bridge\"... in actuality London Bridge is just up the street and is fairly average.Tower Bridge offers tours (they cost money). You can either tour through the inner workings and see the machinery, or you can walk across the pathway along the top (bring your camera). You can always walk across it for free of course.The bridge is lit up at night. Make sure to walk 3 minutes up the river and visit the HMS Belfast. You can take a tour. Then it's only about another 3 minutes walk to London Bridge, and lucky for you... it's not falling down."

However if you do use the stairs there are some beautiful structural sights to see on the way up. The highlight of the tour is the glass floor so you can see the Thames below. It takes a bit of getting used to though and feels quite surreal. You also get to look around the engine rooms during the tour and the sheer size of them is quite awe inspiring.

Our visit included looking round the machine room underneath the bridge, which was fairly interesting to us non-engineers, but we did want to get to the glass-bottomed walkway over the River Thames. On entering the building we were pointed straightaway to the lift, which was quite upsetting for one of our group who is definitely a \"liftophobe\" and she found the relatively short ride quite hard. It was only when we were ready to descend to street level that we found there were stairs we could use. However, it was quite something to find ourselves looking down through the glass to the river and to the people walking across the bridge beneath us! We were all quite hesitant about standing on the glass, but once we had done so you couldn't get us off! It's definitely a brilliant photo-opportunity and we did all thoroughly enjoy ourselves."

Because we traveled to the city by train (Gatwick Express) we had a sweet 2 for 1 deal coupon that we could use. Saves a lot of money, just pick up a coupon booklet at a train station and keep you tickets/receipt.The views are fantastic, however you can see more from London Eye or the top of St. Paul's. There are stairs leading up to the walkway, but you could take the elevator if you're lazy... But there is a long wait, and you'll miss out on the bridge's inside architecture. Before you enter the walkway you are able to see a short film about the bridge's origin, which is fun. Once you'll enter the walkway you'll see some great views of the city. Both walkways have a collection of photos explaining the different types of bridges. Also, in the middle of both walkways there is a section with glass flooring. If you are afraid of heights, be aware, because you are looking down towards the road. Though, if you are lucky, you timed your visit perfectly and you'll see the bridge lift (we weren't that lucky). These glass floors are also a magnet for obnoxious tourists that want to suddenly lay down... :-( Tickets also allow you to visit the steam engines, which is a short walk away at the foot of the bridge. There is also a small shop and cafe here."

You also get to go into the engine room and learn about how they would raise and lower the bridge, but my husband and I had little interest in that. If you have a two-for-one, are really interested in bridges, or want to learn about steam engines, you should go, but otherwise I'd say give it a miss and save your money for something else in this quite expensive city."

We were able to stand on a glass platform walkway and look down when the bridge was open to allow a cruise ship to pass through so that was pretty cool.

I have to admit I always called it the London Bridge, but I stand corrected.We used our London Pass, which allowed us to fast track through the line. There was a multitude of stairs to go up. There had to be at least 5 flights. They really worked my thighs and shins. I am glad we brought some water with us, because we had to stop at least twice. I also noticed that my friend and I weren\u2019t the only ones having issues mastering the stairs \u2013 so were a couple of other people. When you get to the top there is a hologram regarding the history of the making of the tower. It was worth watching, and I would highly recommend it. You can also sit down after completing those stairs, to catch your breath. You then walk down a corridor that allows you to look at the city from above the bridge. Along the outer walls, there are pictures of other bridges from around the world. In certain sections, there is a sky walk where you can walk over large glass areas and look down at the bridge or Thames below. My friend and I are both afraid of heights, so we were so scared to do it and couldn\u2019t fathom people just sitting on it like it was just another piece of the floor. On the second side of the walkway, my friend and I held hands to assist with our bravery. Needless to say, it worked and we walked a good portion of the sky walk. After you are done with them, you go down another flight of stairs to the Lift to take you downstairs. We then go back outside to follow a blue line to the engine rooms. There was a boiler, several steam engines, large black tools, and interactive exhibits for adults and children to try regarding the workings of the engines for the Tower of London."

There are two routes up - stairs (lots of them - over 200) or lift (10 minute wait when we got there). The stairs are prettier; the lift is quicker. We took the stairs. I am not that fit but I made it without needing oxygen! There are places you can stop to take a break on the way up. There are 2 information films to watch. There are also lots of pictures of different types of bridges with lots of facts and figures about those and how they compare to Tower Bridge. Rather disappointed to find there were only 5 panels of glass on each side of the bridge and these were generally packed with tourists taking selfies and hogging the walkway. However, when you do get your go, it is a weird feeling and you have to do one thing every day that scares you! Great views of London too.Take the time to go across the bridge - follow the blue line, to the engine rooms. Very nice gift shop there too.We did our visit without really planning it. We just happened to be at the Tower and I suggested it. If you plan your visit see if you can get it to coincide with a bridge lift like we did. Great stuff!"

There is so much to see whilst you are there from the workings of the bridge to the wonderful view of the Thames that you get. It is an excellent example of British Engineering. At night time, it is even better as you can watch all the lights on it flickering like candles. I think this is a magnificent item to visit and would highly recommend it."

It's not well advertised but they have installed areas on the floor with glass. Quite the view looking down. Tough to get a photo at times due to the number of parents who use the glass as a baby sitter for their children. This is a fine example of the Visual Cliff experiment not working."

Very reasonable price and did not have to queue at all to get in. After a brief introduction my granddaughter was given stickers to go onto a free passport she had been given with the chance to collect more during the visit ( all free) we watched a short video and then wandered on our own . Great fun daring to walk on the glass section of the bridge and fun to watch the traffic below. We then wandered round the engine rooms. The staff were all very helpful and informative and gave us the heads up that the bridge was opening a few hours later which we managed to catch . Would highly recommend a visit ."

There are a few videos to give you a history of the bridge and yes, it's actually still a working bridge and opens up multiple times per day for boats to come in.At the top of the bridge there is a very large glass floor. I'll admit it took me a while to get up the guts to stand on that glass floor. I kept sprinting across it but when the guide there told me it was built to hold an elephant I felt a little better standing on it. When you look down you'll see either the people walking across the bridge or the water. Either one is terrifying but you just can't leave without standing, sitting, or lying on that glass because you'll regret it.Other than that, it's a bridge. You walk across it, take pictures, admire the view, and walk off. But that glass floor really gives it an extra excitement."

We decided to avoid the queues for the lift and walked the 200 stairs up instead which actually did feel too bad. The walkways are great, don't feel too high up and give excellent views of the river and beyond. Nice that they have small windows you can open to talk better photos. The exhibitions about the bridge and other famous bridges are really interesting and informative. The best bit is the glass walkway which is great to watch the people and boats below from, really don't feel that high but still leave it to the kids to sit on the glass! We finished by visiting the engine room which was also really well done and very interesting. All in all really enjoyed the trip and would highly recommend to others."

The entire exhibition is a highly informative museum really, albeit a working one as the bridge still carries traffic and opens regularly to allow shipping to pass. The views are very nice from the top, and the glass floor is an amazing experience (see if you can walk on it without feeling just a little uneasy). One tip - note what time the bridge opens to allow shipping through and get your position at the glass floor early - people will not move to let you look! After that be sure to visit the engine room so see examples of Victorian engineering at its best."

To see how it was built and see the giant Victorian boilers and engines used to lift the bridge was fantastic. Then to stand on the glass floor and look down on tiny people,car etc offers a great photo opportunity. Sit on the glass and have you picture taken. It looks like you are sitting in mid air. It is a steady walk up ,but you can get the lift. Toilets at midway points."

A must see Tour of The London Tower Bridge Exhibition.The Bridge was designed by Sir Horace Jones and it was opened on June 30, in 1894.The magnificent Bridge is 65 m in height .Enjoy the spectacular views of London and The River Thames from 42 metres looking through the glass walk way platforms and glass floors.You also get to see the Victorian workings of the Engine Room and watch movies that show a full history of the Bridge.There is also a great Gift Shop . We just had to bring back our own painting of the Bridge which we had framed that is now proudly hanging on our wall.You can buy tickets on line at a discount price to avoid being in a long Que. waiting on the day of your visit. We purchased a London Pass before we left for London so that helped reduce the cost also we didn't need to Que. at all.The Address is Tower Bridge Rd, London SE1 2 UP United Kingdom.As from May this year we can now say we have climbed it , walked across it then sailed through it.Enjoy your visit it's great for all ages as there is a huge lift.Whilst we were there we saw the bridge allow a tall sail sailing ship pass through. It was the high light of our tour. "

Just visited again for the first time since 1982 when it had just opened and it has changed from somewhere to visit to a tourist attraction.The main element is walking over the upper bridges & the views, especially of the Tower of London, otherwise there is not a lot inside to see other than the wonderful structure. The special element is the glass floors on the walkways, that you have to cross over, that add that little extra.I found the staff quite friendly for such an attraction too.When you then exit & walk down to the engine room, there is a lift hidden behind the tower that is not marked on the left. Look out for it if you have a buggy.Down in the engine rooms you can see the old steam engines. They reminded me that I need to visit Kew Pumping station on a steaming day to see these engines in action!"

But if you are looking for something a little more in-depth, try to book one of the Engineering Tours. This tour is 2 hours long and not cheap (50 pounds) but it takes you to places most people never see: the bridge control room, the machinery room and - most impressively - the immense bascule chambers. The tours book up REALLY quickly. There is only one tour per day with a limit of 12 people and only during specific months (November to March, I think). If you can't get on this tour, the bridge is still worth a visit . . . but if you are planning your trip well in advance and you have an interest in the engineering aspect of this London landmark, this tour is amazing."

My husband was more fascinated with the engine room than I was but I'm glad I got to see it (perhaps just for not as long!) The booking was for anytime that day and that worked very well for us. It was raining the day we were there (not that unlikely of course) so our view was diminished but still worthy. There are two glass portions on the upper walkway and are fun to look down through. Most people however did not choose to walk across them, instead skirted around the sides! Ha! They are quite safe, but something unnerving about standing on it! I can see this area getting very crowed so if you get a sunny day, I'd be there at opening to try to reduce the crowd. We are glad we experienced it!"

I have not been to the top of Tower Bridge since they installed the glass walkway so I decided another visit was due and this time with my seven year old daughter. We brought tickets online a few weeks before we visited London which turned out to be a great idea as we flew past the ticketless visitors queuing and made our way straight to the top of the bridge.Once at the top, there are video's and displays on the history, design and construction of Tower Bridge as well as fascinating historical photographs and interactive screens. There are great views of London from the top looking down the Thames and the new glass walkways are a great addition, if not a little unnerving! My daughter loved them though and wasted no time lying down on them for a floating photo opportunity! The pumping rooms are also great and offer lots of information and the whole experience is self-guided so you are free to take as long as you want. There is a children's activity book which is given out free where they collect stickers throughout the exhibition which added to the fun and sense of adventure for my daughter.A nice little exhibition at a very reasonable price. I would recommend this for all ages although be careful if you are not great with heights! We timed our visit around the time a sailing barge was due to sail under the bridge so we got to see the bridge lifted just before we went in. Try and time your visit to coincide with the bridge lifting to get the full experience."

Little did we understand that you had over 14 flights of stairs and my wife was very tired by the time we got to the top.The attraction starts with a video via Harry Potter style about the history of the bridge. It is done very well and worth watching. You then enter the walkway between the towers and can see up and down the river. The walkway also has a clear floor towards the middle so you can see down to the water and street below. You will then enter the other tower and can cross over to the other walkway or go down the tower and exit out."

The trip around the bridge doesn't take too long - you go up one tower (on the north side of the river) and watch a short movie of how the bridge came to be constructed, then work your way across the top of the bridge and down in the south tower. The video was OK for me as a native English speaker but I think a number of foreign tourists who were watching at the time found it difficult to follow - the acoustics are not great and the voices of the victorian characters in the film are not especially clear. The highlight is the walk across the top of the bridge to the other tower over the partly glass floor which really striking but not great for those with vertigo I suppose!When I was there a large sailing barge was passing through so they lifted the bridge to let it through. Great to see that from the elevated view above through the glass floor. Apparently the same boat passes through several times a day so worth getting the times right to suit. The important thing too is to go on after you've come down from the second tower to the engine/pump room. You follow a blue line on the pavement after the exit from the tower along the street and down some steps to the reconstructed pump room. The mechanism of the bridge workings is explained really well here and the old steam pumps that powered the bridge are still there and working (though not connected up to the bridge anymore). Definitely worth going to this part of the museum - I noticed a number of people coming out of the tower and simply walking off - they missed the most interesting part!Definitely worth the trip - it's such an iconic landmark in London."

After buying your ticket, you take the lift to the viewing platforms at the top (or take the stairs up if preferred), and there you get unusual views of London. Of course, you are right above the River Thames, so you get a great view of the river boats, and the buildings along the riverbanks. But due to the two areas of glass floor, you also get a birds eye view of the road traffic across the bridge, and everyone with cameras was going wild. It is an unusual angle to take photos of the classic red London buses, but they come out really well. You don't have to walk across the glass floor, as you can walk around it, but it was surprising how many people summoned up the courage to try it. Best of all though, was a really interesting exhibition about the world's other iconic bridges, plus some lesser known bridges which are exceptional for some reason. Old bridges, new bridges, historic or brand new, there were interesting stories about all of them. Most people walk down the stairs at the other end, though a small lift allows a short cut down, and this is where you follow the blue line on the pavement to take you to the engine rooms. There are toilets (yes, inside the bridge structure!) and a gift shop (next to engine rooms), and although no cafe there are dozens nearby, and we would recommend St Katherine's Dock, just a three minute walk away, for sheer choice of restaurants. All in all, a great few hours in London with great views."

Open to the public by day Tower Bridge offers you an insight into Victorian engineering at its very best , a great place for young people to become interested in structures , steam power and a golden age for GB. Why was it built ? A huge challenge faced the City of London Corporation \u2013 how to build a bridge downstream from London Bridge without disrupting river traffic activities. A special committee formed in 1876 opened the design for the new crossing to public competition. Over 50 designs were submitted for consideration, many of which are on display at Tower Bridge Exhibition. It wasn\u2019t until October 1884 however, that Horace Jones, the City Architect, in collaboration with John Wolfe Barry, provided the final design. Go on line to see the History of Tower Bridge . If you ever get the chance hold a party on one of the walk ways- just do it . At night the road and river traffic takes on a fascinating detail and looking into the Tower of London offers a totally different aspect . The addition of the glass walkways again makes your visit memorable."

It is quite scary and disconcerting at first, quite a few people were stepping around the side of the glass not wanting to step on it. The staff were encouraging, telling us that the glass can support a tonne or something, and informing us that it can't break at all! My kids had some great photos taken of them \"flying\" above the Thames (actually lying on the glass floor).The engine room at the bottom was really interesting, because you can see the inner workings of the bridge. It was amazing to see the huge machinery, along with the massive spanners too.A really good place to visit - great views and informative too."

The Tower Bridge (commonly mistaken for the London Bridge) is the result of a design competition and remains as a great piece of 18th Century British engineering and architecture.The bridge opens around 900 times a year, so there is a reasonable chance you will see it in action. I did the 'London Bridge Exhibition' which is essentially a self-guided touring through the inner workings of the bridge. On the tour you will have the opportunity to walk through the upper bridge supports and see through the glass floor onto the road deck below. It's up here that the bridge opening times are also displayed. You also get to go down into the old engine room to see how the bridge was operated up until the 1970's, when electric motors replaced the steam driven units. There are also a couple of short but informative video's along the way that give you a good understanding of the history of the bridge and how the old lifting system worked. Allow 1-2 hours to see the bridge properly. I had a London Pass which gave me express entry and as a result, bypassed the large queue."

Tickets are \u00a39.00 but there is a small discount if you pre buy on line. This also allows you to skip the ticket queue once you are inside the entrance hall. The first room is large and has seats and is a bit Disniesque as Queen Victoria and the architect talk to you via a film. This was spoilt a bit by several non English speakers chattering all the way through it. The next two rooms are the high walk ways you can see from outside. These are lined with lots of information to read about famous bridges around the world. There are also lots of facts and figures about the bridge and the alternative designs put forward when it was proposed. These walkways house glass floors which are unnerving to walk on. A tip is to not linger too long on the first one, everyone stops there for photos, wait until you reach the second one, it is less crowded. Then you leave the bridge and walk along to the engine room which shows you how the original bridge was powered. Even for a non scientific person like me, this was really interesting and well explained. The really good part was being outside when the bridge opened. This, of course, costs nothing and you can look up on line to see when it is going to open each day. Usually only about three times a day. Seeing the gates being closed and being part of the hushed crowd was great. London at its best."

A family ticket is about 25 pounds which suited our budget.My wife took the elevator up while my sons (11 & 15) and me took the stairs. It was quite a climb but we got there. Not many other people were on the stairs up....to be honest we met no one!Somehow we did manage to get to the top faster than my wife (can only guess that at busy days it will be quite a wait for the elevator). At the top you first can see a short video about building the bridge. If only about 7 to 10 minutes it is a nice film to watch.Moving on you get to the actual bridge (stretching from one side to the other). Also here you can watch a video about the history but the most impressive is the glass floor. Here you can watch downwards to the cars & busses driving on the bridge. If you have fear of heights you will not like this and you might want to pass by the brick part :-).You can walk up and down both sides of the bridge and when you want to exit you normally take the elevator. In our case it was very slow and the woman there led us via the stairs downwards and let us out via a backdoor. After exiting you can go to the Engine room (follow the blue line after exiting) and the giftshop.I must say we spend all in all about an hour and liked it a lot and took several pictures of the scenery and of course downwards through the glass."

I have walked over the bridge many times before and enjoyed the strole up the top. We chose to climb the stairs rather than queue for the lift. This we found easier than we imagined and strangely there were toilets available on the way up. The tour starts with a short audio visual presentation about the building of the bridge (English only) then you walk across one of the connecting walkways. These are fully enclosed and have information about other famous bridges around the world. You then get to walk over a glass floor which gives you views of the river and road below. By downloading the app you can see what it looks like as the bridge opens for river boats. If you are lucky or time your visit right you may see the bridge lifting (times on web) but I think watching the bridge open form the river side is best. At the end of this walkway there is another presentation/animation which shows how the bridge was constructed. Don't miss the entrance to the other walkway to your right. This second walkway gives views over central London towards the city. After this you descend back to the road level and walk following the blue line to the end of the bridge where the engine room visit starts. The steam engines are now turned by electricity but have the smell of coal, and oil which used to provide the energy for the bridge. This part of the tour is signed in multiple languages. I really liked this part of the tour. The tour is interesting and views of London can be seen that from any other vantage point cost a lot more. The highlight is the glass floor. I enjoyed the tour and would recommend using a two for one voucher if traveling to London by train."

Very well thought-out exhibition especially pictures of other bridges around the world. A bit scary to walk \"on\" the glass, but fun. Fantastic views of London and beyond on a clear day. I thought the \"turn up and go\" entry price Adult 9/Child 3.90 pounds (up to age 15 yrs) was good value. You can go online for a slightly cheaper price and book in advance. Really enjoyed it!"

The strong and sturdy bridge is a statement to the magnificent building and design skills of a bygone age. To stand on the bridge and look at the construction is amazing. We were privileged to see the bridge raised to let through a cruise ship while we were staying close by. The views from the bridge are fabulous. Just to stop awhile and watch everyday London pass byr, the Thames is so busy , the variety of boats and ships you can see passing under is vast. You can visit the engine room and the glass floor walkway to, it is an added bonus but not necessary , just stop and breathe in the sights and sounds of London from this magnificent bridge and you will fall in love with it"

The price is \u00a39 per adult, but look out for 2-4-1 vouchers, which is a more realistic price point in my opinion. The tour starts the second d you step into the lift with the lift operator telling you what the tour involves.The exhibition starts with a clever presentation involving a short projection show of how the bridge design was chosen, then off you go to walk across the tower itself. The glass floor is a shorter span than I expected and is a section in the middle - but nonetheless, the effect is amazing. To look down on the traffic, both road and river, was stunning. But not for those of you who may be afraid of heights! If you are, keep your head up and enjoy the stunning views! When you've had enough of the views, back down in the lift and back outside, a short walk to visit the engine rooms (make sure you keep hold of your original ticket as you need to show it again to access the engine room). All in all, a worthwhile visit, and another thing ticked off my list!"

Steam, hydraulics, ..One piece of irony that is displayed at the bridge, I think 400 workers (seems low) built the bridge. The sign reads something like, despite no labor laws, only 10 people were killed whilst building the bridge. Only 10! Imagine that. I wonder how their families felt.I guess the wait wasn't too bad. But the express feature of the London Pass did not seem an advantage as people who walked right in and paid for a ticket actually moved ahead in the queue faster than those in the London pass line."

We opted to take the stairs, which was really interesting. Be warned, it is a lot of stairs! Once you are at the top, you can watch a short video about the Tower Bridge and how it was constructed. Then you walk across \u2013 there are small windows that you can take pictures from and a large portion of the floor is glass that you can look beneath at the cars and pedestrians walking. Once you are to the other side, you can watch another short video and walk across the other side of the bridge. There are amazing views of the Tower of London and the Thames River. When you are done with the Tower Bridge you can go to the pump room, but we opted to complete the tour after the bridge. It is a quick attraction, but the views were great and it was a well done attraction. If you are looking for a relatively cheap attraction in London, the Tower Bridge will not disappoint."

Walking to Tower Bridge is great anyway - on one side of the river Thames there is Tower of London and Gherkin, on another - the Shard (tallest building in the EU). From the bridge you can enjoy a breathtaking panorama of London with all these landmarks and skyscrapers!We decided to go inside the bridge, which was cheaper than expected - \u00a39.00 for adults or about \u00a320.00 for a family with 2 children. Once you are there, the elevator brings you to the upper part of the bridge. Some parts of the floor there are made of strong glass. You can walk on it and see Thames and the traffic on the lower part of the bridge through it. A special experience (a bit scary but totally safe). The ticket also includes a visit to the engine room downstairs. There was some entertainment for kids as well - they get stickers to collect into a small album called \"Tower Bridge Passport\" (included in the ticket price). This was really a good idea, because it kept the children busy and they did not get annoyed by their parent's sightseeing."

So I spontaneously decided to visit the Tower Bridge Experience and surely it didn't disappoint. You start on the 4th floor (lift available!) with a short film about the bridge's history before you enter the main attraction: the two connecting walkways with the glass floor. Apart from the great views up and down the Thames, the look down is a fun bonus! You can also open the windows on either side, so you can take your photographs without reflection. There's another short film before you go down to ground level again, and your ticket also includes a visit to the machine room at the end of the bridge (hold on to your ticket!), and of course there's a gift shop at the end of the tour.The Tower Bridge Experience is definitely worth a visit, the price is modest (\u00a39 per adult), and you'll get enough history and plenty of views."

It is absolutely worth a pause for the picture - and to note the lighting and angles. (You can get very different pictures at different angles: play and have fun!)I took a guided tour of the inside and history of the bridge. The tour proper was well organized and VERY comprehensive. There were portions that were interactive, but for the most part it was speaking, photos with text, and movies. I learned a lot about Tower Bridge (structurally, politically, and historically) as well as bridge mechanics in general. However, I found that for me, it did not capture my interest to the extent of many of the other options near it, in either topic nor how the information is presented. Employees were helpful and friendly, so this would be a fantastic couple of hours for someone very interested in bridges and/or Tower Bridge, but I would highly suggest that a typical tourist get their obligatory photos and focus their time elsewhere. If you want a taste of the bridge, the pictures and captions will likely prove sufficient."

Wooden hand rails and the huge girders which is the skeleton of the towers. There are benches to gain your breath should you need it at various points. Then we got to the top walkway...the bit at the top with the lattice windows. There is a length of floor which is glass giving you the opportunity to take pictures from an unusual perspective. There are 'guides' all around to help and answer questions although there is plenty of information posted all over. There are even little windows that open to allow you to take a picture without the risk of glare from a flash. Then we returned to ground level, the turns on the stairwell each having a nugget of information about various London attractions. The price of the ticket also includes a visit to the original engine rooms. There is plenty of information posted around...and in several languages too as well as the cleanest shiniest steam engine I have ever seen. A talented photographer would have a field day in there!!!

You go up in the lift to the walk way, you are shown a short film on the history of the design and building of the bridge, then you step out onto the walkway - and it hits you - the views are awesome!!! There is a section of the floor that is glass and so you can see the road bridge and the river below - it was amazing. If you don't like heights, you can walk around the panels and not look down. After the walkways you then go along to the engine rooms, it's not long maybe an hour in total, but definably worth it."

They allow only so many people on the Bridge and walkway at one time which is really nice, it could get crowded. Once you are in the Tower, you go on an interactive tour of the buildings. On both sides, there are clear walkways in the towers so you can see down on the traffic below you. It was completely awesome. People were even laying down and taking selfies. At one end, they have one of those touristy photo kiosk booths and normally, my friends and I would have ignored it but it wasn't bad. There were plenty of options and the picture came out nicely. Down the stairs on the other side, you find the gift shop and you can go down into the engine rooms. The Bridge is great for pictures and is a true iconic landmark. On the right hand side, facing the Thames and the London Bridge to your back is an area for people watching. Mr. Whippy trucks also hang out in this area so you can get an ice cream cone to boot. Close to the London Bridge Underground.Tons of stairs though but there are elevators if you aren't physically able."

Personally, I enjoyed the exhibition on the walkway about other meaningful bridges throughout the World. My personal favourite was the bridge which formed part of the Autoroute from Paris to Barcelona. One thing we weren't impressed with was that the lift on one side of the bridge was out-of-order. We ended up walking down the spiral stairs. Also at the bottom we had to exit through a grotty shop selling 'momentoes' of the Bridge, sad way to end a good tour."

Tower Bridge with its blue and white suspension bridge is a picture perfect place to take your selfies and photos as memento from London. Many mistakes this as London Bridge, one that is next parallel to this is called like that and this one as Tower Bridge. Huge cruise ships cross this bridge now and then - if you are lucky you can wait to watch the bridge open in the middle to allow these giants cross that. For best views, start from Tower Hill and walk along the trees parallel to Thames river. Another one is across the Tower Hill on other side of Thames River where circle or Globe look building is present. If you are coming from Tower Hill towards the Tower bridge, walk past the bridge and you see old yachts and ships parked for some good photo opportunity. You can pay ticket and go inside to get some good views.. but if you are short of time.. spending time around the place is good enough for a beautiful experience. Nearest tube station was Tower Hill - District and Circle. Antique bus without doors (route 15) still runs near this place. You can also get down at London Bridge station and walk past the HMS Belfast ship to reach the Tower Bridge. Spectacular London Skyline can be seen from here."

Just follow the blue line painted on the floor when you come out of the main exhibit and it will take you straight to it.Afterwards we had a stroll along the north bank of the Thames and was going to go into the Tower of London but the queue was very long so we just hung about on the embankment which was lovely in the sunshine.A good day out that didn't cost the earth!!"

We also paid to climb the stairs to the top, tour the art exhibit, and see the view from the glass walkway. I honestly would probably skip this the next time. I was at 44 at the time and in relatively good shape, but I was literally about to fall over by the time we reached the top. We visited in late July and it was a warm day. It was really warm in the stairwell and also walking around the bridge/art exhibit area at the top. The views of that part of London (and especially of the Tower of London) were fantastic, but I'm not sure they were worth the climb. As I recall there was an elevator available if you are disabled or unable to make the climb for some reason. Tower Bridge is so iconic that I can't imagine going to London and not seeing it. It is literally around the corner from Tower of London so definitely plan on seeing both on the same day. Tower Bridge makes for great pictures...both from the bridge itself and also from the sidewalks that run alongside the river. There is no charge to walk across the bridge...only if you want to see how it operates and/or go up to the glass walkway that spans the top part of the bridge."

I suppose most people already have seen a picture of this bridge, but it is far more impressive to experience it yourself. This is one of the must dos in London. You can walk across the entire bridge, and this will give you good views of the River Thames and the surrounding buildings. You also can walk on a glass floor somewhere between the towers. I haven't tried this myself, but I can imagine it is worth the money it costs. This will give you even better views of River Thames and the surroundings. If possible, try to be near the bridge when it opens! You should visit the bridge twice. Once at daytime, and once when it's dark. The bridge is lit up in the dark and looks really nice!"

With our time being tight we weren't able to read and take in all the history and construction details which would be good to go back to.

In the bottom of the pillars you can see the mechanism that made the bridge go up, together with a small museum showing how things was operated at that time. with wax figures showing how. aroun 14 pound for an entrance ticket.

We were not disappointed. It was our Golden Wedding so we just had to do something different - all sorts of events take place there. It is possible to climb the steps up to the walkways, but we haven't got that sort of energy so used the lift with everyone else. Once up there, there are great views of the river. We particularly enjoyed looking down through the glass panels in part of the floor, but it took a bit of getting used to. If you time it right it is possible to see the bridge go up, but we caught this before doing the tour. There were several guides on hand for help and advice and one young lady was very kindly taking photos for everyone. There were panels full of information about the most famous bridge in the world, all along the walkways. The tour continues further along the road into the engine rooms. Much as we'd loved to have seen them, time was getting on, so we gave that part a miss. Maybe we'll do it another time when in London. Well worth a visit."

You can pay and get to the next level of the bridge which we didn't. But the view of the tower bridge itself is magnificent. This is by far my favorite monument in London! The highlight was that we saw the bridge open and close many times during the course of the time we were there."

We paid \u00a318 for a family ticket of 2 adults and a child aged 5-15 (the price it would be for just 2 adults alone). Tickets can be bought at the gift shop at the end of the tour (the Engine Rooms & Shop) which is situated below the southern end of the bridge (and had no queue) or the beginning (the North Tower) which had a slight queue. I noticed a possible \u00a32 off something (not sure if it was for tickets) with people flyering outside the Main Entrance at the foot of the North Tower.You're given the option to go up in the lift or use the stairs. We used the stairs and I'd highly recommend that - you get to see the structure of the tower itself (seems a shame to waste that opportunity).Once on the walkways, I loved that there were small openings through which you could put your camera through to get a photograph either up or down river and with no glass in the way. Also, the glass walkways on both sides were brilliant.If you can, I'd suggest looking up the bridge opening times for that day and trying to coincide being on the walkway around that time; it would offer you a great view.Really recommend this."

If you are not physically fit or have small children, I would recommend you take the lift to the top of the tower. There was and incredible amount of stairs to climb. Once you are up the top of the towers there is a glass walkway you can venture across and see the road and river Thames below you. It's incredible and great fun. You can take some amazing pictures. The views of London are spectacular. 360 degree views. There are lots of history boards and facts to read. Children love this attraction as much as the adults. Once you have walked down either side of the tower run ways you get the chance to follow the blue line to the engine room. Do not miss this chance. We nearly did not go and would have regreted it, incredible Victorian engine room full of facts. Gift shop has some gorgeous ideas for presents, This is a reasonably priced fun attraction.

Even though it wasn't a favorite of the locals, it clearly grew on them and its a must see in London when you walk along the Thames River.Tip: You can get the best pictures from the City Hall park on the side of the Bridge."

Taking the lift is very time consuming, we had to take the lift to return to ground level & we were waiting a long time for it to arrive. The area we waited to catch the lift got very full due to the time delay & people were getting quite fed up. Just a warning also, it can get pretty squashed in the lift. There are some short films that you can watch about thew building of the bridge which are ok but the screens up on the top area where the glass floor is are a bit pointless watching as visitors are constantly walking infront of the screen & it can be noisy. Not the visitors fault just a bit of a bad set up. The views from the top are very good & worth seeing along with a visit to the engine rooms which are a very short walk away. I would advise a visit but it is a shame that the set up isn't a-little better."

The Exhibition is good for the history and you can watch a short video of how the Tower of London came about. You can take the lift but is quicker to walk, if you are feeling fit!

You can view the bridge from anywhere near The Tower of London, London Bridge, bus number 15, walk out from Tower Hill and Tower gateway station.. Go there at night and see the lights lit up, is magical."

It takes you a couple of minutes to realize that you were wrong your entire childhood when you pictured this bridge in mind and you called it the London bridge.The London bridge is in fact an ordinary bridge down the river.A new attraction was opened recently that includes going up the bridge and walking/lying on a glass floor. If you try to forget the fact that a couple of months ago a tourist dropped a bottle on the glass floor and cracked it you can start enjoying this attraction and start taking selfies of you lying on the floor \"falling\" to the ground.After a while you get used to this floor and the magic disappears.I was told that the bridge is packed with people when actual boats cross the river and require the bridge to open to let them pass. If you have a chance to be there at that time it is probably quite an experience.So to sum it up: cute glass floor, beautiful bridge. If you have an hour to kill, go for it, if you are short of time you can see the bridge, take a picture of it and continue to the Tower of London."

            "review": "Must See, Obviously. I happened to cross the Tower Bridge a few times on my July 2014 trip. One of them included a bridge opening, and another a walk on top of the bridge. Here are the impressions: First of all, if you're in London for the first time, you must see this bridge at least once, obviously. This is the second most famous landmark of a top world city, so there's little excuse for not coming here. Keep in mind that it's a bit further out though, some pictures/collages digitally overlay it on top of the Westminster district (next to the Big Ben and London Eye), but in fact it's quite a bit to the east.For the bridge lift: it's nothing super-interesting, but worth it if you have the time. Check online for lift hours, and come a bit in advance. If you come in the morning, there is a place just to the east on the south bank which is accessible during the low tide (and with little to no tourists!), so you can take a perfect picture. In the afternoon there's the Tower of London area on the northern side (probably very crowded at any time), or the south bank promenade.The bridge exhibit and top of the bridge: it's a bit disappointing, but if you have a card like the LondonPass, then why not. You get to see some nice views from the top, the history of the tower, and the engine room."

After seeing London Bridge from afar, not only was it a treat to walk across it, but to actually be inside it, and see the old engines etc, was amazing.The way into the Bridge Exhibition is easily signposted and easy to follow. It is actually a surprise when you get into the area where you pay/show your online tickets, as it's a really spacious modern looking ticket office. A small group of us where then taken into a lift at the back and a staff member operated the lift. I was a bit nervous as I really had no idea what to expect or how high it would be when we got there.Getting out of the lift we walked into a room that showed a film about the history of the bridge. We came to it right near the end, but what I liked most was the way the room we were in had been designed. Steel girders and all sorts of building materials were exposed, and there were models of men as they would have been working in various locations, to give an impression of what it would have looked like when it had been built.We then walked into the exhibition room which is actually the walkways that you see connecting the two towers when you look from the outside. I knew that is where the exhibition was held, but I wasn't prepared for how high up we were and it took me a few minutes to convince myself that it wasn't THAT high. It was even more unsettling because I could feel the traffic vibrating through the floor.But...the views were absolutely stunning. Looking down the Thames from both ways and looking out at London itself, I know there are higher places in London in which to get a good view, but for \u00a39 for 2 people (using 2 for 1 train ticket offer) the price for that view alone was worth it, but with the exhibition and everything else that was to follow, it was a bargain, even at \u00a318 it would be worth it.I love bridges, so the exhibition was perfect for me, showing all different types of bridges from around the world, full of fascinating facts and history regarding the building of bridges. There were many things to read and look at, but the view was what kept calling to me.  It wasn't really that busy either, considering it was early July and early afternoon and I wonder if this is one of the tourist attractions in London that maybe doesn't get quite as much publicity as say Buckingham Palace or the Tower of London. It was pleasant walking around the exhibit and there was no difficulty in being able to read all the information.When we left the exhibit area the next thing I couldn't wait to see was the engine room. I was actually so excited to see how the bridge used to be operated when it had to lift open to allow large ships to pass underneath. I really liked the benches they had so you could sit and watch the engines work. Seeing the steam pump engines actually working was just great. I spent way too long taking a video of how everything moved and hissed. Fascinating technology and the history behind the bridge is really one of brilliant British engineering. I know that will probably pass a lot of people by, but when you sit back and think what they achieved in the late 19th century, it is amazing.Pressed penny alert! For those of you out there who like collecting pressed pennies there are two machines, one inside the exhibit walkway and then one as you leave the engine room just before you head into the shop. They have some nice designs and the machine presses them well.I was quite surprised to find myself exiting the Bridge through quite a large shop, as for some reason I thought it would be smaller than it was. Usual London souvenir stuff for places that aren't the Tower Bridge, but there were enough items of the Bridge to keep me happy, if you buy a guidebook make SURE that whether you pick it up or one of the staff members, that you purchase the right one for you. It was only when we got back to the hotel that night that we realised we had been given a French book, and had to go back all the way from Greenwich the following day to swap.I absolutely love this place and am sorely tempted to go back again on my next London visit. It's a beautiful bridge, an icon, but don't let us forget the men who designed, built, toiled and created the technology that allowed it to become that icon of engineering. I hope that most people will not just see it as tourist attraction but as something more."

After climbing many stairs to get to the top, we watched a short video that tells an amusing history of the bridge and then proceeded out onto the span that crosses the Thames high above the roadway crossing. For the record there is a lift if you need it, but the stairs a fun! Looking down through the see-through flooring you can see the roadway of the drawbridge and the river below! This was frightening for some people who refused to walk on that section, amazing for others (myself included), and even a bit unnerving. We got some really great photos on this section of the bridge! Tower bridge is just down the river from the Tower of London and makes for a great afternoon."

The opportunity to walk across the top of one of the most famous bridges in the world sounded like a good idea. Despite fears of long queues, we arrived, bought a ticket and started climbing the tower in less than 10 minutes ( can't promise its always like that!!).Informative video displays on the way up give you a chance for a breather and to learn the history of the bridge. Then its the walkway across the top with the chance to look down onto the road and river through the transparent viewing sections.We were lucky enough to be at the top during a bridge lift. This made the visit extra special. Amazing to look down as the road lifted to reveal the river below. If you can plan a visit to coincide with a bridge lift do so. I think you can check for times on the website. Once leaving the Tower please make sure you take the short walk to go underground to the engine room display. The cost is included in the ticket price and is well worth the effort to see the some beautiful engineering."

Moreover, there's a glass floor fitted in the passage at the top of the bridge and it allows you to look through it and see the traffic underneath - you can even walk through it (provided you're not afraid of heights) - quite thrilling experience.

Small parts of the walkways have got strong glass in them so that you can now stand above the Thames and look down at the water and open top buses through the glass. Super stuff and not for some but if you do this you will be rewarded. The accommodating staff will take photos for you to prove you have done this!! Better than selfies anyday.Videos about the building of the bridge and the pictures of all 20 London bridges along with the most exciting bridges in the world are also shown. When you have seen this you can walk a short walk to the massive engine rooms designed in the 19th century to power this icon bridge. Marvel at the quality of the engineering of the day .Tip--take the family..good for allTip--take a cameraTip-allow an hour or two Tip--when you have seen the engine rooms continue crossing the bridge and turn left down Shad Thames for affordable cafes and snack bars.If you found this helpful please tick the Helpful box below..Thanks."

I'm not sure how much the tour itself cost (we had the London Pass which included the price of most London attractions) but I definitely recommend taking the tour if you're visiting London. Not only to you get an amazing view at the top of the tower, but you get the history behind the planning, and building of this famous tower, including all the engineering side behind it as well. A great tour, and a great way to spend the morning."

This is definitely the most distinctive looking bridge along the River Thames and a favourite of any London skyline. And it is nice to walk along the bridge to see take a view of the Thames. However the Tower bridge is also a living and breathing part of every day life. There are cars passing through the Tower Bridge every day. If you are on the Tower of London side facing the bridge, there are steps on the left that will bring you to these marina area. (St Katherine's Pier). There are offices and also lovely restaurants to eat at while facing the yachts and bridge. If you walk over to the other side of the bridge and go down the stairs, there is the Butler Wharf - again shops and restaurants. Its a nice area because it was converted from the old warehouses so the buildings are very distinctive looking, shops around and the restaurants can again offer fantastic view of the Tower Bridge while dining."

This particular bridge was one of the only bridges in London that was not bombed during WWII because as I understood it, the German forces used it as a landmark in aerial attacks. The bridge itself is awe inspiring. It looks like something out of a fairy tale and at night it is positively magnificent. I saw this bridge lit up at night several times on my first vacation to London. The top catwalk portion of the bridge has an exhibit of other noteworthy bridges from many countries around the world. I cannot recall if this was an exhibit found on the London Pass, I believe my friends and I paid an extra fee to go up into the bridge itself but it was well worth the cost."

Even though the distance between those two bridges are about 1km apart, but both bridges look so much different. Tower Bridge is a very beautiful bridge, with a upper level walkway that reward you a fantastic view of London city. I did not go up due to time factor, but I was already inspired and impressed just from its exterior. The freshly painted coat of blue and white somehow gave the bridge a fresh look from its classic pale stone design. It is no wonder Tower Bridge is admired by many as iconic London Bridge. It would be nice to spend a lovely afternoon just admiring and walk the bridge."

This iconic London landmark has got it all, incredible history that keeps up with today's modernity ie. it's new glass floor on the upper walkway structure (accessed via lifts) with even parties &/or even holding wedding ceremonies. It is an interesting visit for kids as well as Mum And Dad. There are engineering tours to learn how the majestic Victorian machinery works and the views especially on a sunny morning when we went are sublime St Paul's, the Shard, the Thames snaking through the city, makes you very proud to be British!"

We visited the Monument first, and purchased combined tickets for \u00a310.50 and bypassed the lines waiting to purchase tickets at the Bridge. You can take the stairs but we'd just claimed 311 steps to the top of the monument so we took the elevator. Once at the top there is a short film, then you go out to the walkway between the two main towers. There is a glass floor part way over with great views of the traffic below and the river. The tower bridge has free WiFi so you can use your social media whilst you are inside. Once you descend to street level at the other side of the bridge you can go into the old engine rooms which are no longer used but are kept in immaculate condition and are well worth a look. The interpretive signboards give you all the information on how the hydraulics worked to lift the bridge before it switched over to electric power. Check the Tower Bridge website as it lists times when the bridge opens each day and you can time your visit to see this amazing, and very quick, sight."

I had seen on the website that there was a draw lift at 12.30 and decided to view the opening of the bridge from the riverside rather than from the glass floor on the upper walkways. Nice photos were taken and we even saw the barge that had just come through moor in front of us at London Bridge City Pier. On the upper walkways which can be reached by a lift we particularly liked the exhibition about famous bridges of the world and of course the views of all the buildings around old and new."

The main attraction to the children was the glass floor and seeing the bridge opening for a boat to pass through. It was a lovely, sunny day and we made the most of it by sitting on the south side of the river just people and boat watching.My only criticism is that there could have been interactive displays and activities for the children (aged 7 and 10). However, as I have said in my title, it is refreshing to have an affordable and appropriately priced London attraction for once (and that's from a Londoner!)."

When at the top, you are free to walk around at your own leisure.

The structure is beautiful and impressive, and the exhibition inside is very well arranged and interesting. However, their promotion of a \u201cglass bridge\u201d across the Thames is misleading, and that is why I gave the Bridge Tower less points. There is no glass bridge \u2013 there are some glass panels at the bottom of the upper level of the bridge, which make it possible to view the river and the traffic below. It is quite impressive, and worth while, but it does not provide a full crossing of the Thames from side to side on glass. London is so full of amazing places, that I would not put the Bridge Tower on top of the list. But if you have more than a couple of days, a visit here could be pleasant."

At \u00a39 a ticket, we thought we would pop in and see what it was all about. The central attraction is the glass-floored walkways between the main towers. You are around 150-feet up, whcih is a great new way to see the city. There is also an extensive and detailed history of the construction of the bridge, other notable bridges around the world, a spot on London at the time of the building of the bridge, and I think maybe some sort of film. To be honest, I spent most of the time jumping up and down on the perspex floors, and pretending to squash the tiny citizens of London beneath my might feet, which was more fun that I imagined it would be.I'd suggest this is a good stop-off on any tourist visit, as the bridge itself must be one of the most beautiful buildings in all of London.

The bridge is opened 3 times a days so you can plan your visit a bit in advance to be there when it opens (with of course more visitors up at that time).Note that you do have some small sliding windows on the side that allows to take excellent pictures from both sides (toward Canary Wharf and toward Town hall side). there is multiple sliding windows to explore.The engine part on the bottom is not to be missed as well with impressive machinery"

Although there were quite a few people there the staff were great in thinning the crowd out by suggesting other things to look at. When you do get to the top of the bridge there are glass floor sections on BOTH walkways taking up the full width and approximately 10 m in length.The best tip I can give is to look online for when the bridge will be open and visit on those times. We were lucky to be by the glass walkway when the bridge opened and a large vessel sailed through. At times like these staff ensure no one is on the glass so that everyone who is there can get a great view."

You're also given access to the top walkway of the bridge with its glass panels in the floor, an ideal selfie opportunity... There are a couple of film presentations and also some old restored boilers. It was \u00a39 adult fee, which for London attractions is pretty good.

You can climb the stairs to the upper walkways, but considering our state of exhaustion after tramping through London all day, we gratefully accepted the offer to go up on the lift.There is an excellent introductory video that explains the origins of the bridge and the engineering that went into it. As you proceed along the walkway, 42 meters above the Thames, you cross the glass floor, where you can see the traffic moving below you. All along the walkway, there are information panels describing other significant bridges from around the world, as well as sign boards and video screens which give you more information about the views from the bridge and the history.Once you've crossed both walkways, you can continue your tour on ground level (and below) by walking down to the Victorian Engine Rooms to see how the bridge was powered in the past. Great for the steam or engineering buff. The tour ends in the gift shop, with all the usual London souvenirs. As with the London Eye, you have to be patient if you want to get photos without hoards of people in the way, but you're not hurried through, so you can take all the time you need."

It was a sunny day when we visited and on approaching Tower Bridge ,you start to wonder why you(I) don't visit London more often,because it has so many things to see and the landscape is changing yearly!The attraction itself is well presented and informative,without it being a 'school lesson'!!!!!! You can read the info panels or watch the videos-i would recommend you do both as you can only get out of this attraction what you put in. The glass floor was a good added feature-although I did think it would be larger in size,from the photo's. A visit to the 'steam room's is approx 200mtrs from the main event but well worth going to see,so you can understand how it all works.Its a shame they do not open the bridge once per day,everyday of the year,at a set time for everyone to watch and enjoy. I do appreciate the chaos this could cause with Traffic but if they do it for Changing of th Guard-why not do it for the most famous/iconic Bridge in the World!!???"

We decided to take the stairway to the top, which turned out to be a bad idea as neither of us like heights. It was quite scary to be walking up several flights of stairs in a Victorian building feeling the towers seeming to be moving in the wind. Probably an illusion, but nonetheless scary. There is a lift available, which is quite small, so we decided to be brave!There are stops on the climb up to the top with presentations of the history etc, but not enough places to sit to watch them. We also left quickly as we are both quick walkers and the slow moving tourists were quite annoying on the narrow stairs.When we went, the walkway over the Thames was still as it was. However, since going we heard that it is now glassed over instead. There's no way we would go back, especially as I read on the news that someone had dropped something on the glass and cracked it! If you don't mind heights, or walking over glass at height, you won't find this a problem!The engine room of the tower was interesting to me, but not so much to my partner. After leaving, we were aboard HMS Belfast, which is close by, and had the opportunity to watch Tower Bridge being raised to allow a large yacht to pass through. If you get the chance, this is well worth seeing."

The various exhibitions are all informative, and the attendants quick to give the kids the sticker sheets, however as we didn't receive the main card, I ended up covered in small stickers!Once you leave the bridge, there is also the opportunity to visit the engine house, which I suspect many people don't do.

The displays and media affects are excellent and provide you with an insight to the history of the bridge and the enormous importance its building made to the life of the capital. The new glass floors which allow you to peer down onto the road and river below provides the visitor with a spectacular view for those who unlike mean don't get 'jelly legs' when looking down from heights. The children however seemed to love it. The glass is 4 inches in depth and has 7 layers this fact still couldn't persuade me to stand on it but my fellow travellers did. Definitely would recommend it as a must visit."

We were starkly aware of the contrasting beauty of this magnificent bridge with some of the modern building constructions to have recently graced the London skyline; most of them eye-saws that have, in my opinion, ruined the look of England's fairest City. I personally don't like the Shard, Gherkin or Cheese Grater - which i think looks like a hood from a hoodie. these monstrosities do nothing for me. However; tower bridge is truly spectacular!!! There are 2 \"towers\" and 2 gatehouses, beautifully impressive and built from cream stone that glows in the sunshine. We spent a good half hour or more wandering from one side to the other and back to see from where we could get the best view, but decided in the end to go down onto the embankment and walk along in the direction of Westminster; the views just got better and better. We didn't go into the tower as we'd spent the whole day visiting London attractions, I would have liked to have walked across the glass platform, but we have some fabulous photos and wonderful memories of our week-end in London. Maybe next time I visit London I will go inside the tower bridge and walk across the glass walkway."

The glass walkways were a lot of fun, even my nervous partner dared to step on them, overcoming his fear! It did get abit crowded though as some people spent too long sitting on the glass panels, taking loads of photos. Great views up & down the Thames. The engine room & explanation of how the bridge lifts is fascinating. Rounded off our visit by watching the bridge lift - both whilst looking down from the walkways & from outside. Tower Bridge is such an icon of London, well worth visiting to see what happens inside it."

I've walked across the bridge a few times on the \"ground\" level, but decided that for this trip, we would try exploring the upper levels and the engine rooms. We're really glad that we did since it was such a fun way to see the city and experience the landmark. We opted to take the stairs to the upper deck over the elevator which ended up being a nice way to see the insides of the bridge towers. Upon getting to the top, there were a few videos available giving the history of the bridge and then of course, the infamous walkways with the glass floors. It's surprising how intimidating it can be to go out on the glass even though you know you're fully supported. Still, we braved it and got some really great photos and videos from the experience.

There are audio visual presentations on the initial concepts, tendering for the project and the actual construction, all are well presented, informative and interesting. Both upper level walkways incorporate glass floors, enabling you to look down to the road and river some 200feet below. Do not miss the machine rooms which house the steam engines and ancillary equipment used to raise and lower the bridge, a separate display but included in the price.

The inside of the tower maintains it's ornate victorian industrial structure - it's slightly shabby which makes it feel so genuine - and you can imagine the late 19th century visitors taking the same spiral stairs. For this reason - don't take the lift at the entrance if you can avoid it - walk up instead. The top is fun with the glass walkway being scarier than i expected, but once you overcome your nerves you can watch the world go by below. There are some attempts at films and info panels - it's not fluid, cleanly designed scenography so don't expect masses of multimedia exhibits - but this fits with the charm of the place and you can explore at your own pace. The trip to the engine room at the end is worth it, even if machines are not your thing. Just seeing the engineering needed to move the bridge is impressive. Went with a baby (in a sling - buggy could be tricky if busy, but there are lifts), 5 and 10 year old girls. A shame there's no caf\u00e9 at the top...with the view, it would be great.

The views on top of the tower bridge were very nice however your view may be obstructed by the bridge itself (the support girders) depending if you can get a decent spot. They do have designated view spots to see some nice views of the river and surrounding London. It is also a mini museum, illustrating a brief history of tower bridge. Once you have finished taking snaps/looking at the museum, you can enter the engine room and also view a short video, again, about the history of tower bridge which was pretty interesting. I believe you can stay at the top as long as you want and after the video you can exi the top part of the bridge (and go to the toilet if needed) and proceed to the rest of the engine room at the base of the bridge.I believe by purchasing a ticket to visit the top of the tower, it also entitles you to visit the engine room for free. The engine room is very crammed but also another nice little museum-esque area. Once you have finished there is also a gift shop you can visit."

We also got to climb the tower to the bridges (Elevators available for those who can't do 200 stairs). Walking across the 2 different glass floors was both amazing and very scary at the same time. Who can really say they walked in the Tower Bridge over a glass floor looking down at the famous Thames River? We also took a tour of the machinery room explaining how the Tower Bridge works. On the Tower Bridge there are little windows that open as well so you can take some great pictures from above with an unobstructed view. If this attraction was in the USA it would have easily cost at least $25+ for the same thing. With todays not so safe world we live in I was surprised this attraction was open to the public.

Whenever I look at this bridge, I know I am in London, it kinds of represents the city to me. Walking across the bridge offers splendid views on both sides and I like to walk along the River Thames all the way to WestMinister especially in cool weather both daytime and nighttime, you should try it too! From far, you see how beautiful the Tower Bridge especially at night as it offers tourists and locals a chance to admire its beauty. At the bridge, you can learn the history of this bridge by taking the elevator up. You have to pay the entrance fee, not cheap but the reward you get to see a better view near the top, go when the weather is good! For discounted entrance fees, book online is a good option!

            "review": "To some it is just a bridge, to others it is the inside view of history. Tower bridge is one of most recognizable icons of London aside from perhaps Big Ben and the London Eye. It also has some rich history, from dead man's hole (where they scooped out dead bodies from the river) to the fact it was never bombed during WW2, and even its existence, coming from a design competition and some novel technologies that were put into place to have a bridge which can retract to allow ship traffic to pass. The bridge is open to tourists to climb up (or ride up) to the top and see the bridge from the insides. I recommend the climb as you get to see the old stairs and interior structure. There are a couple of movies up top which goes over the history of how and why the bridge was built, and recently they've added glass floors to the two walkways. Its great to watch people slowly step onto the glass, unsure if it will hold. Meanwhile you've got me happily jumping up and down on it - it isn't going anywhere (as long as you don't drop a beer on it). Great photo op.Don't forget the tour of the engine room at the end, and for a small additional fee you also get admission to the Monument to the fire of 1666."

We had a London Pass so that allowed us to go to the front of the line and not queue with the rest of the people waiting, which was a long line. The Bridge is beautiful and you can get some great pictures walking up to the Exhibition entrance (though there will be a ton of people behind you too as they are trying to do the same thing). Once you get your tickets, if you have kids they give them a really cute Passport booklet and at 4 different spots during your tour they collect sticker pages, then build the bridge with the stickers. That was neat. You can wait for the lift (elevator) or take the stairs. We opted for the less crowded stairs...be warned - there are A LOT of them! Like 200 or so. But it is fun to do. Once near the top you can watch (optional) a short 5 minute film about the builder which sets the tone for when it was being built. The star of the tour is getting to walk across the glass floor and look down to the cars crossing below, the people, and the Thames. You can get some great pics by lying down on the glass! There are great views of the city too from the crosswalks. The only thing I wish we could have done was climb higher onto the towers to get an even better vantage point. You can then walk across the bridge and go under to see the steam engine room as it would have been used, then exit through a small souvenir shop. It was a memory that the kids will definitely remember, and I would recommend anyone to do."

It's great been able to see the bridge from a different perspective and the views from the walkway are excellent (look for the little camera hatches you can open). There are also really friendly and knowledgeable staff on hand and info boards about what you can see and bridges in general. Following this you walk along the other walkway before descending by lift and out onto the bridge following the blue line to the engine rooms underneath the bridge (next to the gift shop).

The same ticket then allows you to visit the 'Engine Rooms' where you get to see the steam engines that provided the power to lift the centre span of the bridge.There is also a 'Souvenir shop etc."

Make sure you keep your ticket to visit it. The steam machinery is kept in prestine condition. I am happy to have seen this historic monument.

We had to walk up to the walkway, I didn't count how many steps, but my wife had to stop a number of times to catch her breath! On the way up you can see the original ironworks, and admire the quality of work, and imagine the labour involved in it's construction. Just before going outside you can sit and watch a short documentary on the origins of the Bridge, which was interesting. The walkway is some110 feet above the roadway beneath, but at this stage you are not really aware of that. Roughly halfway across the glass insert walk is approached, so one is now walking on the glass viewing the vehicles 100 feet below, beneath them the Thames flowing at right angles to the traffic. Certainly a sight not to be missed, incidentally if there is a fear of heights you do not have to walk on the glass. A welcome lift takes you down to road height, we were lucky insomuch that at midday the bridge raises to allow one of the larger vessels to go upstream. It takes a mere 60 seconds to raise these enormous bascules to 86o, an amazing feat of Victorian engineering. Unfortunately we did not have time to visit the engine room, certainly a sight not to be missed."

We bought a combined ticket to monument too which was not much more than the entrance to just Tower bridge.I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the Bridge experience, even the climb up the stairs (there is a lift too for the less energetic). I thought the whole thing was informative and unique. The glass floor is a work of genius as a tourist attraction and many were taking full advantage of the photo opportunities. There are lots of info. boards around and videos which add to educational value. There is also a bridges of the world hall of fame. The engine room is well worth the walk across the bridge to it. The entrance fee is usually \u00a39 per adult and I would have been happy if I had paid it. The views are good even on the dull cloudy day that we had. I was glad to have walked up the monument too but it is a really monumental climb at 311 steps, only do it if you think you can manage it. There are not any stop off points as such and you have to pass the people coming down/up on a narrowish spiral staircase. The views are good although there is currently a lot of building work going on nearby, it was actually interesting to watch the cranes though."

While we visited there were several voices from other visitors who clearly expected this to be something else, possibly they thought it was the Tower of London. But it is a bridge, albeit a brilliant one! Even the walk up is good, there are some \"mini-exhibitions\" on the way (as well as toilets, should you need them)and once at the top there are two sides to walk along, enjoy the views and learn an awful lot about the history of the bridge and surrounding area.If you weren't actually intending visiting the bridge, but find yourself nearby, especially in bad weather, then you will not regret going for a visit. It should take no more than two hours and you are already located well for the Tower of London, Shard, Borough Market and others. This is an inexpensive attraction, which has the ability to interest even the most uninterested. It does get busy, but it is worth checking out the timetable of bridge lifts to see if your visit can coincide."

I don't know what the 15th March reviewer Raymond M is on about as I've never met any Briton who refers to Tower Bridge as 'London Bridge', also London Bridge is not '2 miles down the road'. 'Actually' that is the next bridge upriver, less than half a mile away! And, the MI6 Building is at Vauxhall Cross, beside Vauxhall Bridge, and nowhere near any 'Shakespeare theatre'.I have never read such a load of misleading balderdash in all my life!The Tower Bridge is a true icon of London and to many is THE symbol of London. It was completed as recently as 1894 although many people think it's much older, as the towers are built in such a style as to complement the architecture of the Tower of London nearby.I have not yet paid to enter the exhibition, an unforgivable omission I soon hope to rectify.But I have viewed, or walked across it many times and seen the bascules raised on several occasions. I once took a river trip from Tilbury on the 'Waverley' to the Pool of London and back and they were raised for us twice."

On a \"tourists in our own town\" weekend to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary, my wife and I came across the Tower Bridge tour whilst exploring the South Bank section of the Thames Path. We decided to check it out and were not disappointed! The history of the bridge is of great interest and is brought to life by a collection of films, images and information boards as well as the engine room/bascule walk-through tour and friendly knowledgeable guides. The views from the towers are spectacular - East towards Canary Wharf and West towards Central London and the glass walkways are a must - once you've won the battle of mind over matter and plucked up the courage to step onto the glass that is all there is between you and the roadway and river 120 feet below! The guide helpfully pointed out that each walkway could support the weight of 6 adult elephants but this still didn't stop early trepidation! Well worth it in the end though. This attraction is not at all expensive and has some great deals for families. Recommended."

The glass floors in the high-level corridor are slightly vertigo inducing but once overcome are fun. I only did the east corridor as I went down to the engineering area but I really wish I had - views towards central London.The engineering room was great, massive steam engines in all their victorian splendour.I got the combined ticket with the London Monument, only \u00a31.50 more and valid for 7 days. Be aware that you do need to walk from the south tower to the engine room and the day I went it was raining so take an umbrella."

The entry fee is only 9 GBP and it was absolutely worth it. We didn't have to queue long to get in. The staff was overall very friendly and helpful. You go up in an elevator and first sit down to watch a short and quite funny movie. Because only a few people fit into the elevator it is not crowded and you definetely get a seat for the movie. Then you go straight to the glass floor and can look down one side of the Thames and when you arrive at the end you can go down the other glass floor and look down the other side of the Thames. It was not crowded and we were instructed to take as much time, as we wanted, sit or lay down and read a bit about the construction of the bridge. There were also pictures and information about other interesting bridges around the world, which was cool. The speical thing about the whole experience is not only the excellent view over London, but the glass floor. It absolutely freaked me out and I had to go along the narrow wooden floor at the sides, but if you're not afraid of heights, it must be great :). On your way out you can watch yet another short film about the construction of the bridge, then get a chance to use the bathroom and go on the elevator down. Hold on to your ticket and go a short walk of 2 mins over the bridge to the engine rooms. This one is especially for everybody interested in the technology of the bridge. Overall rating: Highly enjoyable, would always do this again. Go for it!"

Unluckily was not any camera with me, and later in the years I never had more that luck to watch it to be open. However I walked through and took other pics. Still missed the Tower Bridge experience when can walk up to the top, hopefully soon I can get that, too. Because that part of London is full with modern buildings, a bit odd to have this old fashioned but beautiful bridge with The Tower of London which is also staying there from centuries, the image is a bit strange. But to worth while."

Despite pre booking you still had to join the queue with everyone else. We got to the top of the tower 10mins before the bridge opened. There were no staff to be seen near the glass walkways. People had parked themselves around the edge of the glass so if you didn't want to walk across you had no choice because no one would move. People were laying across the glass so when it came to the bridge opening you couldn't walk across. There was a rather unhelpful tannoy asking people to not block the walk way to allow other people to see which everyone ignored. I ended up watching the opening of the bridge on someones phone which they left filming in the middle of the floor, I could have saved myself the trouble of going up there and watched it on youtube. Very poorly managed. Would not visit again."

In london on a busy half term friday & wanted to do something we hadn't done before so thought we'd head here. Very glad we did.The entrance is on the bridge, it was pretty busy but the lines were going quickly. All the staff we spoke to were really lovely, which always makes a difference. We paid \u00a320.30 for 2 adults & 2 children.When you get in you need to wait for the lift although you are offered the stairs. I asked how many & was told 200 so decided we'd wait for the lift! My eldest son & daughter got in the lift which made it full up, my other son wanted to walk up so we decided to meet them at the top. I can confirm 200 steps, it's not all spiral though as i thought it might be & there is a level where you can sit & prepare yourself for the next lot of stairs! It wasn't too bad lol.When we got to the top there was a short video playing then staff directed us along the walkways. Lovely & bright with great views along the thames, both walkways have facts & info about Tower Bridge & also pics & info of bridges from around the world. They also have a big strip of glass down the corridor, where children stand, sit or lay completely unconcerned about the drop below & parents stand on the side away from the glass! The majority of us parents had the same idea! I did stand on it eventually!Once one corridor is done you go through & go down the other. We actually thought that was the end of the attraction but once finished went down in the lift & were directed to the engine rooms, these housed 2 very large steam things (i'm sorry i wasn't listening & engines aren't my thing!) that raise the bridge. The boys (being boys) were very interested in this. Another film playing just through the corridor, some more facts & little activities for kids or adults down the hall & the trip was over.We really really enjoyed this, the kids (teens) loved the glass floor & the engine rooms and the gift shop wasn't too expensive either. Totally recommended"

The bridge itself looks good but there are plenty of good views of it which are free. You begin by queuing up, outside in February with a cold wind blowing down the river. This is regardless of whether you have booked ahead. Once you are inside after around 15 mins you join the next queue for the lift. At the top there is an awful movie, I lasted 30 seconds. The viewing galleries themselves are big. The view isn't amazing. You get a better view for free up the top of One New Change, Primrose Hill or even on DLR. The glass floor is a bit of a gimmick. All I could see was the feet of the crowd around me, a few children's bodies, the murky brown of the Thames (again, free elsewhere) and the top of a queue of traffic. If you really want to queue up for a cr\u00e8che and pay for the experience then go for it. I only have it 1 because I couldn't give it 0."

Double back under the bridge and follow signs for St Catherine's Dock grabbing an Ice cream on the way. The Dock is very inspiring, probably the oldest in London, beautiful boats from barges to luxury. Good places to eat, snack or just have a coffee or drink. Worth a look at the shops too.My Wife and I love this walk and have done it many times, with something different each time."

Great informative \"show\" explaining the history as to how the bridge first came about, the design etc. At the very top there are numerous information boards and photos of its history and other bridges around the world. It was an eye opener to see so many unusual designs.The glass floor was impressive and it took me a couple of minutes to pluck up the courage to walk onto it, having failed to walk the glass floor in the CN Tower, many years ago. I was so very proud of myself for walking onto it and then wondered why I was so scared in the first place. There was a member of staff who was very helpful in answering the questions we had and was able to show footage of the view through the glass floor when the bridge opens, from using his tablet on a QR code printed on the floor.We visited the engine rooms afterwards, but not being into engines, found it less interesting.Overall it is well worth a visit; a beautifully designed bridge with spectacular views from the top and the staff were very helpful."

To go inside this historic London building was amazing experience, we already purchased our tickets online but still had to queue but we were soon at the front desk. You basically then get a lift up to the tower bridge itself where a curtatior in the lift explains how to get to the exit after your initial crossing of the bridge with the glass floor.As soon as you come out of the lift (which is like something you find in a council flat), there is a film been played on a loop with a few benches to sit and watch the history of how Tower Bridge was built. The film was ok played by over acted actors where it should of been more informative, to be inside Tower Bridge is amazing then you walk along the top of it seeing the views of London and come to the glass walkway which is a weird experience looking down to the Thames. Please note a lot of people have lots of photo opportunity so try and go at quieter times if you can. Also the information inside was a bit dull, it seemed it was more interested in showing you other facts of London rather than the bridge itself. What about more information on how the bridge shaped up during the wars and how it was constcuted with more pictures and films about it?.Then you come down the other side in the council lift again a but dull and you are told to follow the blue signs to the engine rooms which again was nice to see but what about real people could be stood in there and pointing and showing more on how the engines use to work in living up the bridge? again there was nothing apart from signs a but of information and the odd couple of vending machines.Of course then you come out at the shop hoping you spend more money, so overall a great experience to say you have been in such a iconic landmark. I felt it needs more information and be a bit more creative which it lacked on."

I'd printed out the voucher ready to use on a previous trip but lost my nerve after spending too much time looking up at the walkways. After flying by myself last year I felt ready to conquer the glass walkway.The exhibition about the history of the Bridge and how it was built was very interesting. I find it amazing that the engineers of the day were able to come up with a plan and actually build it. The exhibition in the Victorian pump room with the equipment originally used to operate the lift mechanism was also interesting and again demonstrated the amazing engineering history of the UK.As well as information about Tower Bridge there were also an exhibition of different types of bridge found all over the world and an exhibition of buildings in the London skyline.Then there's that amazing glass walkway, looking down to the bridge crossing the Thames. I did manage to stand on it briefly but like a lot of people I spent most of my time skirting around the edge of it. You can download an app for you phone and watch the bridge as it is raised and lowered. If you actually want to see the bridge raised while you are visiting the lift times are on the website so you could plan your visit around that. The view from the walkaway of the London skyline and up and down river was good - we did visit a nice sunny day. For those of you into photography there are small windows on the walkway you can open so you can take photos without getting window glare. Only one glass walkway was open - the other was covered by a mat which I quite happily walked over, even though I suspected what was underneath it!"

Childish I know but it has to be done! Also the amazing architecture and if you can be bothered to stand in line and pay the entrance fee a walk across the glass floor gantry. A small tip as well there are stairs at the northern end in the bridge that lead down to an exhibition of the bridge but also back on to the edge of the thames near a ferry pier.worth a trip away from the central london shops to see this and remember the tower of london is right next door so the bridge offfers a good photo platform for snapping the tower and skyline including the shard."

By the time you've used paper and ink to print it your actually worse off ?? Add to that the fact you don't have a dedicated queue and have to wait ages although you've already paid please tell me what the advantage of booking and paying in advance is , if the bridge was at its capacity it doesn't even guarantee you entry saying that well worth the money just don't bother with booking online"

Its not only about beauty but also about the civil engineering in such old time. You can literally see bridge opening to allow tall boats to cross bridge and then close. Its good to walk around with side walk & few other things, you can see the fishes also in the calm water. There is also an old prison.

I have visited it in a week day, so not so croudy and could take lots of pictures.I felt a bit dissapointed that only one path has the glass floor available at once, but I understood is for safety reasons, in case you are affraid of hights. A bit strange as you anyway have to cross the path with the glass floor availble to get to the other one. Before and after the path you get to see short movies on how the bridge was built. The views towards London not so impressive.I have visited the engine room as well;not really wow for me,however I was impressed by the moving wheels through steam, specially considering this was built more than 100 years ago. I took a joint ticket with The Monument, but I recommend only if you are up to go up and down 311 stairs in circle!

Scoped out the spot where we wanted to stand to watch and manage to get that spot - just moved over \"two peoples' worth\" of space by a sweet couple from Essex (who had also scoped out the best spot to stand and watch).The whole process of the bridge opening, the ceremonial passage of the historic boat with a bagpiper, and the gun salute from HMS Belfast, was awesome!Next time we're in the City, we'll definitely tour the inside of the bridge, which my husband has already seen, but I haven't.

The glass walkway was a great aspect of the bridge and seeing the road and river below was great. I was a little too scared to fully walk over it but people were laying down on it so I don't think you're ever at risk. My partner is slightly scared of heights and found the glass floor no problem at all. There is a lot of info on various bridges of the the world and windows that opened to get great photos down the thames without the reflection of the glass which was a great addition. The engine room at the end which you need to walk to is very informative and great to see how the bridge actually works. Can't believe how they come up with it so long ago. Great day out!"

It's an astonishing feat of engineering, that in the days when there were no huge mechanical excavators that such a construction could be undertaken. I looked at the line drawings and found myself thinking that someone must have had a really vivid imagination to dream it up, the actual building it (thanks to an animated film) left me stunned. Speaking personally I wish I'd done the tour the other way round - by starting at the steam boilers and mechanical aspect and the explanation of how it all works and then moving on to the 'view from the top' - those wonderful walkways way up above the road and the river. The walkways have large glass panels in the floor - doesn't matter how thick the glass or to what standard they have been tested, not everyone wants to step onto them. The views up and down the Thames from these vantage points are fantastic, but part of me felt that is only window dressing for what is an amazing concept brought to fruition by very clever, far sighted Victorians. I wasn't impressed by the initial film - it was 'bitty and not all that well done and I found the dialogue poor."

Here\u2019s the link to the schedule:http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/lift-times/There is a nice viewing area on the same side of the river as the Tower of London, but on the other side of the road that goes over the bridge. (It\u2019s northeast of the bridge, if you are looking at a map or have a compass.) This is a good place to view the ship going under the bridge if the ship is going down river, because you see the front of the ship as it\u2019s going under the bridge. (The schedule says whether the ship is going up river or down river.) For ships going up river, I would recommend finding a place by the Tower of London, which is on the other side of the bridge, so you see the front of the ship.We bought tickets ahead of time, but that didn\u2019t seem to be of any benefit.

An hour or so spent discovering how the bridge works, the steam- driven pumping engines with the old boilers, the views from the two high walkways - with the glass floor - and some interesting short films - few minutes long - all help to make this is rewarding and fascinating glimpse into this wonderful bridge. The Souvenir Guide Book is well worth the modest price - I love this Bridge as much as I love the beautiful Big Ben, Wren's St Paul's Cathedral, The White Tower of the Tower of London and so much more in our wonderful Capital City of London!

It is great value at just \u00a39, you can even get a 2 for 1 deal if you have travelled here by national rail. The bridge opened in 1894 and the exterior is very church like with gothic windows. You enter via the North tower and get your first look at the steel skeleton within. Steps or a lift take you to the two upper walkways where you have outstanding views of the city. There are a couple of places where you can slide open the glass windows so you can take better photos. The city view changes every couple of years with the addition of The Shard, Gherkin, Cheesegrater etc. The other walkway faces towards Greenwich and Docklands. In November 2014 parts of the walkway were replaced with a glass floor.You descend via the South tower but hang on to your ticket. You are back outside again but follow the arrows to a separate building which houses the steam engines used to raise the bridge. The bridge doesn't get raised very often over winter. You can check the website or they are listed beside the controllers kiosk on the bridge."

To start with we wondered what all the fuss was about - but once we got into the history of the bridge, watched the various screen presentations and found the cleaver sliding windows out of which one can photograph the stunning views up and down river, we were hooked. We were there for two hours and loved it all. DON'T miss the engine rooms at the end of the visit - a real highlight - and don't skip the screen shows. The only thing we didn't rate was the installation of perspex images of other London buildings on the walls as you go down the stairs in the South Tower - a bit tacky compared to the rest of the displays. The glass walkway is interesting and not too scary for people who don't like heights as they glass is dotted so you can see it is there ... I think it is best visited with someone who knows London and can point out various things ot see."

Although it's a bit of a cattle mart queuing up for it and then moving away quick so you give others their go. At least that's how I felt. Maybe I should have just taken my time.The engine room part is very cool too, so make sure your follow the signs to get from the bridge to that.

My friend was hesitant to walk on it - gave her a bit of a light heading moment... but she did it and then relished in *no fear*! It's just a wonderful moment in life to walk on a glass floor so high up and view the Thames River and the Tower of London and all the beauty you can see from your perch atop Tower Bridge!

We went as a couple and found it really interesting, there were two fairly concise videos about the design and construction followed by the walks down over the bridge. The walks treated you to excellent views and the mind bending glass floor which forced a slight hesitation when standing on it followed by some jumps for re-assurance. it really did give you a kick. We were on the tour for just under 2 hours but had to leave for the train, I think there was another hours worth of milling around the engine room if we had time.After you descend you walk to the engine room which really is amazing to see. Victorian engineering at it's finest.Well worth a visit and good value for money."

A real effort has been made to make the \"Experience\" interesting, from the welcoming film to the Bridges of the World display along the walkways.One disappointment is that the glass walkway is already scuffed up, and it's much shorter/smaller than I expected.Usually I am averse to attractions that involve paying a fee to see a view from up high, but at 9 pounds 50 p this is a relative bargain (39.90 to go to the top of the Shard?!) The walk along Thameside is always enjoyable. Easy to combine this with a tour of the Tower of London."

One of the main attractions is the glass floor which you will either find terrifying or mesmerising. When we visited only one of the two floors was visible, the other had carpet over it. You will probably spend between 1 and 2 hours here if you are interested in learning about the bridge itself. If you just want to se the views or are in a ruch you can do it in an hour, once you are inside. I booked tickets through City Cruises who are currently offering entry plus a 24 hour river roamer ticket for only \u00a310 in total. That is unbelievable value. TIP 1 - be expected to queue even if you have booked tickets in advance. We had to wait for around 45 minutes. of course it will be busier at the weekend TIP 2 - Make sure you find out when sunset is before you go. I would advise going an hour before so you can see the view of city transform."

It didn't matter though, I just thought, at first, that the entry fee was a bit steep for what I'd seen - beautiful though the mechanisms are. The starting point is on the bridge. Staff are on the ball if you've pre-booked (I recommend that you do) or if you have a pushchair or wheelchair and they guide you very promptly - with that all important smile - to the front of a very long queue. You will be told the drill in the lift, so pay attention. Then you wander at your own pace with really good, clear information and attendants on hand, should you need them. Bridge fans (not the card game) will love the information about other famous bridges as well as the Tower Bridge and there are great opportunities for some spectacular photography of the London skyline. There's even an app. What doesn't have an app? The glass floor is 'fun' (as we English like to say, apparently) and there is good information and various points of interest on the way down to make your way to the bit I'd already done. After all of the experience I considered it very good value, especially having bought a combined ticket for the Monument, the ascent of which might be termed London's other Marathon."

You then get to visit the mechanics of the tower & then the shop. I must admit we were very pleasantly surprised at how quickly 2 hrs went by including the waiting on the bridge to buy the tickets.

We live in the provinces so I'd foolishly thought that all Londoners and tourists would be at home wrapping presents or something. Wrong: most of them seemed to be at London Bridge. Still, we didn't have to queue for too long, it was easy to find and near to a transport stop, but a bit far for anyone whose walking is challenged. I went up the lift due to the latter, and the kids and husband went up the steps. You go up the lift, along the bridge and down the other side, out, along, to the engine rooms and out again and that's it; it took us about an hour in total. It was interesting and the best bit - of course - was the glass floor. The children loved it, I hated it! Only one (heavingly busy) side had a glass floor. The other (empty) side just had a long black carpet. Why? the kids wondered. We looked under the edge of the carpet and there, sure enough, was the Thames. I asked the staff why it was covered up and was told that there weren't enough staff to open the floor. Hmmm. I told my friends when we got back and they said that someone had dropped a beer bottle on the glass and cracked it, so they weren't letting people see the crack. The experience was interesting but asI have no interest in engines, don't like heights and don't like crowds, it wasn't the time of my life. My engineer daredevil husband loved it and so did the kids. I don't know what it cost or if it was 'worth it' as it was included with a boat trip. Having seen it I wouldn't go again but I'd say go and see it at least once in your life."

How wrong I was! From the moment you walked into the lift to go up to the tower/footbridge you were being given information, upon leaving the lift you were shown a video about how/why the bridge was made/built. After this you are shown to the footbridge, the views are amazing, then when you get to the glass floor, WOW! A lot of people are huddled around the outside of the glass and a few are walking over the glass! You are given loads of time to take pictures on the glass etc. at the other end there is another video or you can just walk to the other bridge to take pics on the other side of the river (there was another glass floor on this side but it was covered over). After you've had enough time up at the top you can descend the stairs and head to the engine rooms to see how they used to work the bridge, some components still work now simply to show you real life. For the money when compared to other similar tours it was brilliant cannot fault it."

The new addition of the glass floor is FAB. Very weird trusting it and walking over the road and river below but once you get used to it, it's brilliant. We have had a fun, family day out.

The views are amazing and the walls in the middle had some very interesting photos and facts about bridges around the world. I really liked that! And then there's the plexiglass area. I had been expecting a huge, long walkway, but it's really just three smallish sections, and you do have to wait to get your turn to stand. It's a bit disconcerting (the view) and I saw many people freeze. Definitely a good place to take kids.There was a second part of the tour, to the mechanical rooms I think, but we didn't have time to see it.

Simply walking across the bridge was incredible in and of itself. It was just such an iconic experience. And the views of The Tower of London, the Gherkin, St.Paul's, & the Shard were stunning. But what was more impressive, was the Tower Bridge Exhibition, which recently opened. Now, I'm afraid of heights, but I am glad I overcame them in this case to walk across the glass walkway at the top to see the Tower from a most unique perspective with the road and the Thames below. The walkway is strong enough to hold at least 6 elephants, so that was somewhat comforting to know. Not only did I walk across the glass, but I (and others) sat on it and laid on it. I mean, when in Rome...er uh...London...right? That's a story for the grandkids some day! They have awesome little window flaps as well along the sides that you can slide open for unrestricted camera shops of the amazing city scape split by the River. You'll be SO glad you did this.

You then go up in a lift - yay! - to the top of the bridge where there is video to watch about the construction of the bridge. Quite interesting and entertaining. And then you are free to walk across the top span of the bridge where there is an exhibition of bridges around the world. The exhibition is really interesting and the views from the top of the bridge are amazing. It is all sealed and safe, just like walking down a corridor in an office - only the views are better. Unfortunately the glass panel thingy you can stand on hadn't opened when we visited but I wouldn't hesitate to go back!"

My husband bought me tickets to the Tower Bridge exhibition for my birthday, as I'm always taking photos of it when we walk past. It is so stunning on the London skyline so he thought I might want to find out more.He purchased an additional tour, for which you have to book in advance. As far as I know, you can buy tickets to the Engine Rooms and the Walkways on the day, both of which are around \u00a310 I think - but don't quote me on that. Our tickets (\u00a350 pp) included a guided tour of both of these sections, but also of the working engine rooms below sea level. They only run a small number of these tours every year, only in the winter when the river is less busy.Our guide was very interesting, enthusiastic, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable. Our group was roughly 8 people, with my self any my husband being by far the youngest, and perhaps the only ones who weren't engineers or super bridge geeks. Anyways, we went up to the walkways, and the glass floor is dizzying but interesting. We then followed the usual tourist route back down the other tower.The best bit of the tour started now, as we went off the usual tourist trail and down into the working engine rooms, which also house one of the old original steam engines. Most of the science stuff was lost on me but what I did understand was still fascinating. Then, down further we went, eventually finding ourselves in the chamber where the actual bridge moves to when it's opened. Wow. If you can get on one of these tours, really do, as it's an outstanding pit of work.We then went back up (not suitable for people with walking disabilities unfortunately - it's all on steep stairs in original, and working, Victorian chambers) and along to the rest of the tour, including the Engine Rooms, where our guide gave us additional bits on info that weren't necessarily on the info boards.Highly recommended!"

We walked up the many stairs to avoid the long line for the elevators, and this probably saved us at least 30 minutes - and also provided us with our daily exercise requirement! There is a glass floor that allows you to look straight down, which is very impressive. We were also there when the bridge opened to allow a tall boat to pass underneath. This was a great added bonus to see the bridge in operation. After taking lots of photos during the day of our visit we returned at night for more photos when the bridge was illuminated."

The bridge makes a beautiful sight from a distance. Once you reach the bridge, there are many things you can do, The bridge is special because it opens when there are big ships that needs crossing. So walking on the bridge and locating the part of the bridge that 'splits' is a good exercise in itself. Overall worth a visit though it is a bit away from the other famous attractions like palace, Big Ben, London Eye etc."

It is only a small section of the walkway but once you stand on it you see why. It can be a little disorienting. I would highly recommend finding out the bridge opening times so that you can be standing on the glass walkway when this happensThere is then a walk down to the next level and onto the engine rooms. If you are interested in engineering this is the place for you, a fascinating look at how the bridge actually worked This is probably one of the cheapest attractions in London at \u00a39.

I had been here once before but that was a long time ago.We had booked tickets online and saved a pound a piece. The ticked office was busy when we got there at about 3pm, after about a ten minute wait we got our tickets and decided as a group (there were 6 of us) to walk up to the cross walk, rather than wait for an take the lift. The cross walk is 42 meters (138ft) above the river, so the climb is not that bad.At the top of the stairs there is a short film about the history of the bridge, worth the time to stop and watch.Then from there you can walk over the river and back. the Glass floor section is on the Western walk way only.We were fortunate in that the day was sunny and one could see for a long way. There are small panels in the glass windows that you can open to take photo's from without having the glass in the way. Along the way there are numerous panels about other bridges around the world and their claims to fame. These are really interesting and whet your appetite to go and see some of them.Needless to say the area with the glass floor was the most crowded, but if patient you can get on and experience the eerie effect of people walking a 100 ft below, or as a number of people do lay on the floor and have their photo taken, the only downside of taking a picture through the floor is that the glass has a grid of small black dots...After you exit from the South tower you must go and see the Engine room. This is a walk outside, surprisingly quite a long way from the tower. Inside you will find a magnificently maintained Victorian steam engine room definitely worth the visit.If you are a planner, check the \"Bridge Lift Times\" and arrange your trip around that, see in the bridge being raised from above would definitely be worth it."

But if you have the london City card you can jump the queue and get straight in.This is one of the few attractions not run by Merlin, if it was it would be a lot more efficient!So you can go in the lift or walk the stairs, we did the stairs as quite a wait fir the lift. Wow, a lot if stairs! But you can pause and look out the windows on the way up.There is a short film introduction at the top, good to get your breath back during!Then you walk over the top of the bridge. This is where the value is.Great views, and amazing, long glass floor. You feel totally safe on it and just an incredible view of the bridge in action. Kids loved it. Plenty of space for photos and taking your time moving back and forth. You can sit on it, or lay and do selfies with no pressure to move on.There are photos and details about the bridge dotted about, but not of much interest. Then you go down the stairs the other side (or take the lift). You leave the bridge and walk across the other side to the engine room exhibition beneath the bridge. I expect a lot if people don't bother with this, but it was quite good. If you can time your visit with a bridge lift that would be a great experience. You can see lift times on their website.So great value, the kids have talked about it a lot since. The real value is the glass walkway so spend your time up here! We walked round to the other side and found much less people this side so make sure to do both sides. And you can go back again, it's not one way so before you go down the stairs go back fir another look!"

What else would you expect to see through the glass floor but of course a road and the Thames not very far below.The over hyping of the glass floor aside there are interesting facts to read about bridges around the world and of course to be up and inside the Bridge is something worthwhile. Maybe \u00a3 9 is a few pounds overpriced so look out for discount vouchers.There is also the steam engines that operate the raising and lowering of the bridge if you enjoy Victorian engineering. Overall it's worth doing but not really for the view down to the road beneath."

We chose to climb the 300+ steps! not for the faint hearted! But you can take the lift. You are first shown a short film how the bridge came to be built and then proceed to walk down the eastern side of the bridge, back to one of the towers to be shown another short film of the building of it, then to the best bit, walk down the western side with great views and the glass floor! This is brilliant and feels a little un-nerving, not for anyone who is scared of heights. Great photo opportunities.Would recommend, but don't pay full price."

I saw a feature on the BBC news about the bridge and hadn't realised that you could actually walk over the bridge at high level before let alone with a glass floor in the walkway! maybe I just wasn't paying attention to the report but I definitely got the impression that the entire walkway is now glass... It isn't - it is just a 10-15 metre section on the Middle so be prepared to wait your turn to stand/lie/take strange-angled selfie's on the glass bit! There is a lift up ( interestingly an original design feature and not an addition for modern tourist needs) although if you do not have any mobility difficulties, you will have to walk a few steps down on the other side before you can get in a small lift down to ground level. Otherwise staff will bring the 'down' lift to the top floor for you. There is a lot of information about the bridge itself as well as other bridges in the world as you move around and you do get some amazing views of London that you can't get from anywhere else. The high level tour begins and ends with a video - the first of which I found to be a good demonstration of early 2000's video techniques but factually quite 'dumbed down' and not really to my taste and would be a total waste of time for non-english speakers. That said the guide book is reasonably priced and is available in Western European languages and Japanese. Overall, admission prices are not expensive and even cheaper if bought online. This won't get you far-tracked through the queue though but will help at busy times and will save a few quid. You also get to visit the engine room - interesting and never noticed it before tucked away beside the bridge in the south bank. Original engines preserved and do actually 'run' on air/electricity. Make sure you follow the line at the exit and get the full experience. Overall very glad to have done this."

The cost is \u00a39 per adult and \u00a36.30 for a student (with a valid student card). There are other concessions available and it is marginally cheaper if you book online.The bridge is iconic. Absolutely stunning architecture. I have admired it for years but this is the first time I have ever visited inside. There is a lift that takes visitors to the top however we opted to use the stairs - this isn't for the faint hearted as it is around five or 6 flights of stairs but worth doing if you are fit just to get a close up look at the construction.At the top there is a short film explaining how the design came about and how the bridge was constructed. From the film area you then move to the glass walkway - this isn't quite as big as I was expecting but never the less it is great fun (providing you don't have a fear of heights) looking down on the London traffic and the Thames. The views across London are fabulous. Once you have finished on the walkway you can visit the engine rooms.There is nothing about this trip I didn't like. If you love architecture, construction and views across London then this is a brilliant place to visit at a reasonable price. I would certainly visit again"

We have gulped down the varied scenic photographs from possible angles and taken a stride on the bridge. There is a museum (I remember of entrance fees 4 GBP) which would offer to visit the top of bridge for having good photographic opportunities. As the weather was too windy and chilled, we were not encouraged to take up the same (with regrets).I laughed to myself regarding my ignorance of believing this as London Bridge (since childhood) and departed with that opinion after visiting London.

And get the feel of grandness in all."

The views across the London skyline are fabulous but also the view down through the glass floor is awesome, you not only have the movement of the river but also the traffic. Make the effort to then go to the Engine Room which houses all the machinery to lift the bridge. Really interesting with a video showing the construction of the bridge."

First point I should mention is that if using the Underground Railways, the route from the station to the bridge isn't very wheelchair friendly, there are a lot of steps. Best to head up onto the road and go round the Tower of London. You do need a little longer than you think to see it, as it's not a case of going up one side, crossing then down the other. You go up, walk across, back along the other side, then go back the way you've come. Part of the tour includes the engine room which is further down. Due to having to get the Tube back to our coach we didn't have time to see all of it. Nice views from the top, worth seeing"

The visit is essentially in two parts; we visited the engine rooms first and then went on to the bridge. The engine rooms are extraordinary and beautifully presented; a photographer's delight. Signage between the two exhibits is not brilliant but we found our way to the lifts to get us up onto the bridge walkway. The internal structure itself is a really impressive sight and of course there are views up and down the river. The visit includes a short film and many displays to enhance the experience.

But i was surprised at just how much more Tower Bridge has to offer. This is one of the few London attractions which isn't over priced. When you first get out of the lift a short film is playing when that is finished you can walk across the bridge, there are great views down the Thames, but as I suspected the best part was the glass walk way. Feels quite surreal walking across the glass, the glass walk way isn't very long, I thought it would be the whole length of the bridge! You then go down the parallel walkway, no glass on that side, the pictures of bridges on the wall are the same as in the first side. And of course you are offered the chance to have your photo taken, I didn't see anyone agreeing to this. You then get the lift down to the bottom and go up the road to the engineering part. Tower Bridge in London is beautiful bridge and known world wide. I am glad that i have walked across it, but probably will never do it again."

Now you head up in the elevator to view a shoddy video of the Bridge under construction in which pantomime actors speak so quickly that even I as a native English speaker could not understand a word. It is jokey, embarrassing and a waste of time. Then there are some hideous back-lit displays of other landmark buildings dotted around the South tower as you make your way out. This is a total disgrace to London. Avoid it until someone sorts out this mess."

You don't feel rushed and can take loads of photos and take in the views of landmarks like St Pauls and The Shard. Once you have left the bridge there is a short walk to the Engine room were you view the engines that used to power the bridge which was interesting. The shop was very reasonably priced even though we felt a bit ripped off with the price of the photographs."

Needless to say we saw the Tower Bridge in the rain, fog, sunshine, day and night. We saw it from walking the bridge, riding over on the bus, from the river cruise, and got to watch it be raised and lowered. We even ate dinner under the Tower in a little place called The Vault. It's an historic part of London and one of our favorite spots."

We also did the engine room tour. This was a bit lack luster and took about 10minutes if that to complete.This is the best way to truly experience this landmark."

The cost is about 9 pounds or about $14 american. And what you get for these two events. One is a tour of the motor room that shows how they lifted up the bridge in the days of the past. The other is the ability to actually go upstairs to the high level and walk on a glass panel above the roadway and the river. It takes a little bit of energy to finally do it but we finally tried it. It was actually fun to feel like you were floating in the air above the roadway and the River Thames. The whole thing took maybe about 30 minutes but it was definitely worth the time. We had no wait for we arrived on a Friday around noon and the weather was improving so we got a chance to get some good Bridge shots of the River Thames."

The construction alone is mind boggling and when you see the engine room and the size and complexity of boilers and winding wheels you will understand. Even more amazing when you see how few people where involved in the construction. The introduction of a glass walkway has added to the experience and I hope to pay another visit when the other glass walkway is completed. It has an exhibition of famous bridges of the world and Tower Bridge deserves to be included."

We went to London at half term to see Matilda and were looking for some fun but not too expensive (given the cost of theatre tickets) attractions to visit. This one fit the bill beautifully. Not only is it the most iconic of the London bridges but the fact that you can get up into the walkways still amazes me. On the cost front, you can go on Tesco vouchers and on the day we went the ticket cost just over \u00a315 for the four of us. Where else can you go for a couple of hours in London for that price? I enjoyed the exhibition even though I had been before (they have added to it over the years) and the children (two 7 year old boys) genuinely found it interesting. To top it all the walkways offer some spectacular views of the Shard and some of the other newer London skyline as well as great views of the poppies at the Tower on a day when it was difficult to get near."

Having seen the new Glass Walkway at Tower Bridge being opened and promoted on BBC news, it was the selling point in finally visiting this iconic London landmark. We booked our tickets online a few days in advance of our visit;we had to specify which day we wanted to visit, but were not restricted to a set time. We chose to visit at around 10am on a Staurday morning, soon after the walkway had opened. I had feared the worst in terms of queues, but was suprised to find no queue with almost immediate entry. The Tower Bridge exhibition starts with a brief video around how the bridge construction process played out, and the engineering challenges faced during building, which started in 1886, and was not completed until 1894. The video also details alternative designs for the bridge, and how the final design had to be altered due to engineering issues.We were soon onto the walkway, with the main intention of being on the glass walkway and looking down at the bridge. Given that it wasn't too busy, we were able to find plenty of space and time on the glass walkway to take our pictures of the passing vehicles and tourists below. It was suprising that the glass walkway only measured 11m in length, which means space may become a premium at peak times. Also along the walkway was an exhibition of famous bridges around the world, although with the suprising omission of the Golden Gate bridge, arguably the most famous bridge in the world! The walkway also offers great panoramic views of London, although these views are the same from London Bridge, except for you can get Tower Bridge into your shot from there!The Tower Bridge exhibition also includes entry to the engine room, situated at the far end of the bridge. This is an interesting final part of the visit, highlighting the engineering feat in allowing the bridge to open for larger vessels. All in all, a very enjoyable experience, and particularly worth the visit if you are interested in the engineering achievements of the bridge."

            "review": "London Bridge, THAT Glass Floor, and more tips.. Well by now you will know that the easiest way into London is by train; and it can save you money as well. No more looking for expensive parking. Got a Railcard? It becomes even cheaper stil!. So we went down to the railway station a couple of days before we were going; also at a quiet time. Got train tickets that included going to Tower Hill underground. This saves a lot of time queing up to get your tickets there as well. Arrived at Liverpool Street Station, turned left from the barriers; across the station concourse and down the underground. For us it was on the WEST BOUND CIRCLE LINE, and a couple of stops later and we were at Tower Hill. Get out at Tower Hill and head towards the road where you cross over. Straight ahead is the river; and to your left is the Tower Of London. Might just as well take a small Sony Cybershot, which fits neatly into a pocket, and get a few shots of the Tower while you are about it. But as you reach the river; look to your right. Across the river you will see H.M.S. Belfast anchored on the other bank. Just beyond that though, and you can also get a photo of The Shard building. A word of caution to ladies. As you walk towards the bridge you are on cobbled effect pavement. Wear sensible flat shoes; or even trainers. Don't want a twisted ankle to spoil the day out. Why this route you may well ask? All will become crystal clear very shortly. River is on your right, the Tower is on your left. Ahead you will see an underpass that will give you access to the bridge above. There is a place that sells fish and chips and a drink, on your left as you walk through the underpass. As you come out of the other side do NOT turn left to climb the narrow steps to the bridge above. No, because this will leave you on the left side of the bridge as you face south; and this is no good to you at all. Instead look to your right; there you will see wider steps much like those on the underground. There should also be a sign saying \"Tower Bridge Exhibition\" This is your route. When you get out at the top it may not make much sense. However you are now on the right hand side of the bridge, as it faces south. Look down now to the pavement. Beneath your feet you will see a blue painted line. This is the route you will follow to the first Tower of the Bridge where the tickets are sold. Now if when you bought your tickets you remembered to ask your train operator for a 2 for 1 brochure; again you will save some more money. Make sure that you either fill them in before you leave home, or get them online; and print them off. Basically they just need to know your name, when you intend to travel; from which stationn; and to what attraction you wish the tickets to be valid for. When you go to buy your tickets, give them your vouchers plus your rail tickets. Instead of paying \u00a39 each, both of you get in for that same price. (You get your rail tickets back though.)The savings can go towards paying for a drink later on. By now the blue line will have lead you to where you are to buy your tickets. You move to the left and there you will wait for the lift to take you up to the level you need, just over 40 metres above the road. While you are in the lift; which is bigger than you may think; the lady will show you a diagram on the wall. Level 1, is where you started from, and 2 is where you are going to. Levels 2 to 3 is the walk from one Tower to the other; and over THAT glass floor. Level 4 is where you go back down to road level, but she will also remind you to keep your tickets if you wish to the the original engine rooms where the mechanism is that used to raise and lower the bridge. The engine room is part 5 of your trip. When the lift reaches the top you will get the chance to sit down a visual presentation, and watch why the bridge was built in the first place, and who designed it. Top left isa lady who supposed to be Queen Victoria, top right is the designer of the bridge, and the large screen at the bottom has the narrator. It is also on this large screen that you will see in stop motion display how the different stages of the bridge were constructed. Overall really interesting to know. From leaving here you now come to the really attraction of the bridge as well. THAT glass floor. First though on your left side are various types of bridges built around the world. Some of them truly spectacular. Don't miss at intervals on your right side that there are small windows that can be slid open; so that you can take photo's upstream of the Thames and different angles to the Tower Of London; etc. Now you are walking towards that floor. The one thing above everything else is that to our brain it doesn't make sense. We are confused for a while that we can clearly see people walking by, cars and vans in the traffic, or a boat sailing under the bridge. Our mind knows that when we walk on the path or the road it is used to seeing a solid feature beneath our feet; and well to some this just doesn't fit right. Despite the fact that there were people who could see other people standing on this glass; which by the way is about 3 inches thick in total; they still would not set foot on it. Some even made a point of walking around the edge staying well clear of the glass. All in all though it was a great experience in itself and the views are well worth seeing. Next year they are supposed to be putting a glass floor in the left hand side ot Tower Bridge and this in turn will give us a view of downstream Thames, When you get to point 3 on your travels you can either choose to ge down the stairs; or again wait for the lift to take you back to the street level. On leaving, keep looking down on the path. Here again you will see our familiar friend, the blue line which will then take you down to the engine room. Here you can see the massive engines that worked to raise and lowed Tower Bridge. At the further end you will see one massive spanner laying on the floor; this is about three feet long! This was a treat that followed up after going to the Tower Of London. All in all a really great day out and well worth the effort. Time now for a drink and a bite to eat. Walking back the way you came you will see plenty of places to get something to eat or drink. One thing we did notice after we had bought something, was that as we crossed the road to go back to Tower Hill underground, was that to the left of the Tower Hill Memorial gardens, we could see a Wetherspoons place, where we could have eaten and had something to drink in far more comfort. Still remember it for another day. Only recently did the papers carry the story that the top layer of glass had been broken at some fuction where bottled drink was served. Plus a stilletto heel didn't help either. Sounds as though they need to rethink what drinks are served up in."

But the thing that I want to share with you is one of my running sessions in London. Running in London is very difficult I experienced but it can also be quite nice. Of course you know the stories about running in the parks of London, especially Hyde park. Hyde park is a nice big park where a lot of runners come through the day. The problem were that Hyde park was way too far from my hostel called Rest-up London. So I had to choose another route for my daily 30minutes run. I started at the hostel and took my way to the Tower bridge and ran over it. In that way I\u2019ve got an beautiful view over the Thames and I could also see the Tower of London on my left side. After that I took the Thames walk way along to the south walk bridge and from there I took the shortest way back to the hostel. During that run you also have a lot of traffic lights, you can\u2019t prevent that. So if you want to run without any traffic lights you have to choose for Hyde park, otherwise you can choose for a run along the Thames and all the different bridges of London."

The glass walkway was a bit daunting at first but made the visit fun, there are plenty of photo opportunities of the Thames and London landmarks from the walkway.

            "review": "Glass floored walk way fascinated my 3 year old. From a distance the Bridge is an imposing yet beautiful sight - ornate yet strong - a true landmark and piece of history - the opportunity to really explore it and see what goes on really was fantastic.I'd booked tickets online ready - fantastic value ticket (under 5s are free) I'd bought my 3 year old son down to the Tower to see the Poppies and the proximity was too good an opportunity to miss. Nice and easy booking system with a printable barcode to take to the front desk.- very straight forward and seamless experience at the desk when we got there - nice helpful guy who presented Nicholas with his children's \"passport\" and first set up stickers, explaining there were more stickers to collect on the way around - an instant hit with any young child.A very large lit took us and a load of other tourists up to a video room which sounded very interesting but not gripping enough for Nicholas so we quickly moved on to the walkway - stunning views up the river being able to see the Tower where we'd just come from, London Bridge, HMS Belfast, City Hall and all sorts in between. That shortly paled into insignificance though when he realised the glass floor was there. I lost track of how long he spent with the glass floor as he kept going back to it even when pulled away - must have been 20-30 minutes I guess. He was fascinated by it and had a great time walking, crawling and running up and down and watching everything below \"They are all small\" was a popular comment. There's \"normal\" floor all around so you dont have to go on it if you don't want to. A really helpful staff member was on hand to answer any questions and plenty were being asked - especially about the strength of the glass!Coming down the other stair well there was more video opportunity but the real highlight is the staircase and surroundings which really make you feel part of history and are really in keeping with expectations of such a monument. The toilets were at the bottom of the stairwell and a welcome stop-off for a toilet training young boy and were clean and modern.Another lift took us the rest o the way down to road level where you follow a painted trail on the ground to find your way around to the engine room. Having something visual to follow like this was a great hit with Nicholas who insisted on leading the way to right down underneath the bridge, a seperate entrance down underneath road level.The engine rooms were fascinating and Nicholas loved seeing all the spinning wheels and regulators and the collection of really large spanners along with much else:) I can't begin to explain how special this whole experience was. If we lived closer we'd be back time and time again but Yorkshire was a bit of a commute just for a day trip. I can't believe that anyone would not enjoy this magical tour. I would have spent a lot longer there but some off the information is a little dry for a child BUT even with that we were there for about an hour and a half in total which is very respectable for the attention span of a young child and incredible value for the ticket price.I can't leave this without mentioning the Biggles film which was a firm child-hood favourite of mine as a child which gave this visit added meaning to me - to get inside this monument really was a childhood fantasy come true."

WOW!I could end the review there, but of course I wont.WOW, is the best thing I can say about this jaw dropping piece of English engineering at it's best.Probably THE best known (and usually wrongly called London Bridge) & photographed bridge in the world.The sight of this bridge from any angle is stunning.Some camera angles take in modern buildings, but get it just right, and you could be looking at an image of the bridge from the 1920's.Doing a bridge tour is a must, and the walk across the top inside the museum area is great.Views are fantastic and the information on display is quite a good (if lengthy) read.The highlight for me was the tour through the original steam & hydraulic machinery rooms, absolutely amazing!Any male or female interested in turn of the (last) century machinery will be blown away.Anyone who isn't, but has a partner who is, well, your in for a long and boring tour through the machinery rooms. Photography is a \"little\" tough as the lighting isn't so good, and the photography can be a little cramped if you do not have any lens under 24mm.Later afternoon seemed to be good for photography in these engineering spaces as not many people were around. I could only imagine getting good images would be nearly impossible if the rooms had a few visitors.Plenty of more engineering displays, videos and models are great for those of us into engineering, but again boring for those who are not.We did a fun free video email from downstairs, which is worth a look, again, forget it if there are a few visitors.We were on one of the last tours, and I feel this is the best time, if you want to have a good look and not get hurried.I was a bit stunned at how small the roadway is for such a bridge of quite amazing proportions when viewed say from the Tower Of London, but this just adds to it's charm.A piece of history that the Tower Bridge is, really is worth your time for a visit."

The bridge is part of a magnificent view and provides great views of the surrounding area as well. The structure of the bridge is painted red, white, blue, and light blue. I am afraid of heights and falling from bridges but the wide pathways allowed me to walk across without feeling too stressed (don't get me started on the Golden Gate Bridge). Half of the tour exhibit at the top was closed during our visit. We were lucky enough to see the road platform raised later in the week so a tugboat could haul a large ship through. It was cool."

Upon your visit the tickets can be bought either at the northern tower of the bridge [entrance to the bridge exhibition] or at the machine room, that can be found on the southern bank under the bridge. Adult tickets cost 9 pounds (they are valid for the bridge as well as the machine room exhibitions). Discounts for students, children and pensioners apply. It actually doesn't matter from where you would like to start your visit. However, i want to stress that the queue to buy the tickets for the exhibition is smaller in the machine room. There are 2 ways to climb the bridge to the top: either by taking an elevator or taking the stairs. You would need to climb over 100 steps though. On the top you would have a chance to acknowledge yourself with the whole history and building process of the bridge, what i find quite interesting. The middle section of the bridge has been modernized and now is covered in glass frames. Unfortunately i found it a bit odd as it has become more difficult to take pictures of the picturesque views. As at most modern attractions, there is a glass see through floor, what makes it possible to see the bridge, cars, boats etc. from above. After you have reached the southern tower, you will be able to buy some souvenirs. An elevator will take you downstairs to the exit from the bridge. There is no way to exit the southern tower by the stairs. If you follow the blue line on your exit, it will lead you to the machine room. The machine room has a souvenir shop as well. Bathroom facilities are available in every part of the exhibition. Have a great visit!"

I did not see any similar bridge in the rest of Britain or in the other countries I visited or heard about. It is accessible from the Tower area. Taking the boat from Westminster Pier to the Tower gives the opportunity to visit both the Tower and the Tower bridge. Walking on the high bridge gives a pleasant scene of the Thames river and other features on the sides."

So I loved the Tour itself, with the London Pass it was a free tour and right next to the Tower of London, it was very interesting a great sight over the Thames. Although I will say this, don't be brave and take the stairs unless you are in amazing shape as there are ton of them up and no wait to try tackle them, Other than the attraction itself is very infomative and most important allows for you to take a breathtaking view of London"

It is well made with no holes, or trolls lurking underneath. Sometimes opens to let ships through. Don't climb up the road when this is happening! You will fall in the river. Or onto a ship, which could be heading anywhere in the world. Quite an adventure!The bridge caters for those wishing to cross from South London into North London. It also handily works the other way, if you wish to cross from North London to South London (though I don't know why you would want to do that). You can cross with friends or alone, on bicycle, car or foot. If you are in a large ship, remember to go *underneath* the bridge. And call in advance so they can open it.Views are nice. Watch the road if you are driving or cycling. Watch the river if you are the captain of a large ship."

Instead, we decided on Tower Bridge which we expected to be short and sweet. When we got there, even better, as admission was reduced down to 7 pounds. I've seen the spectacular bridge many times from afar and walked across the base so I was really excited to finally go up to see what's inside and experience the tower walkway.The attraction is divided in several stages. In the first stage, you arrive in a mini-theatre to watch a short film on the history on the construction of the bridge. Then we arrived at the walkway across the top with the photo exhibits on world renowned bridges. When I got to the last stage which was the engine room, all my high school science knowledge came rushing back to me. The Victoria engine room was my favorite."

Its two towers, joined by a horizontal roadway rise from the water, flanked by suspension sections on either side. The bridge is beautiful and atmospheric in all seasons including winter days when mist swirls from the water. It is also spectacular at sunrise and sunset times of the day. It is well worth taking time to cross the bridge and view it from different angles. Just standing looking at the Bridge and watching the river below will enable happy memories of London."

The views from the walkway are stunning, giving a different perspective to the Thames and showcasing both historic and modern buildings.The walkway is reached by a lift. There was a brief wait. On arrival at the upper level there was a brief visual presentation. Only one walkway was open. The down river one seemed to be undergoing maintenance. The entry cost was reduced to \u00a37, perhaps to reflect this (with a rail ticket you can get in on a two for one deal which is great value). The amount of information in several languages is just enough. There is also an interesting collection of photographs and detail about bridges around the world. Having reached the southern tower we had to walk down a few flights of stairs to an area with toilets and a gift shop. A final lift took us outside again.Following the blue line you reach the engine room which shows off Victorian engineering ingenuity to great effect.There was the option to have a combined ticket to include The Monument.Well worth a visit for all age groups. Allow 20 to 30 minutes in total."

Also traditional Red London Buses go back and forth across it as well as the famous Black Cab's... It is typical LONDON. There is much to do in this area such as the Tower of London, from which the bridge gets its name, HMS Belfast and a bit further down the river St. Pauls Cathedral and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre can be found.I have yet to go into the engine rooms and up to the top span of the bridge, something I want to do, but just a simple and free walk across and around this magnificent historic bridge is a must.Note: I have included images that I took on visits in Nov 2014 as well as back in Feb 2103 (Very different weather)!"

The staff, the security, the atmosphere were all pretty amazing. Indeed one needs patience for this, but everyone it seemed did have.We are forever grateful to the men and women that died for us, lest we forget!The ceramic poppies were indeed flooded around the tower's.

There are no toilets up there, so to access toilets you have to go over the bridge walkway and go down stairs and then go back up the stairs before you can carry on with your walking tour. It is worth knowing if you have children with you, as I would suggest toilets before you go in to the attraction!! Other than that, there is a nice passport for kids to complete with stickers, which were well received by my family."

In the beginning of the visit, there was a video showing us the construction of this famous bridge. Then, in the two corridors above, there was an exposition with all sort of pictures of the famous bridges in the world. There were also some games. I found it interesting and what I liked most is the fact that we could benefit from a wonderful view of London. I would recommend it to all the visitors of London ;-)."

We were there early and in the morning sunshine and in the absence of the hundreds of visitors about to descend, probably we were very fortunate. What a fabulous place, steeped in history, like a time capsule.The coffee shop is superb, beautiful food and coffee and not over-priced either.

We decided to take a route to the left side of the bridge where there were way less people and we had all the room and time to take photo's and look at it without people pushing on us. Also on that side you can find restaurants (a bit expensive). Definitely worth it to walk over the bridge to see it up close, it is busy but worth it. An added bonus: When you arrive on the other side you can keep walking and visit Borough Market , it is lovely!"

From the ticket/entrance hall we were whisked up to the top of the bridge to the walkways and into a history of the Thames crossings and the differing designs for the bridge, ending with the design and build of what we see today.The route then takes you across the upper bridge steelwork, which is glassed in with no sheer drops. The views are stunning and give an entirely new perspective to the bridge. The visual displays and diagrams are truly excellent as is the film of the construction.If you are keen to see the \"engine room\" do follow the Blue line as the Victorian machinery is really well presented.Certainly a \"budget beater\" tour with prices for 1 adult \u00a37-00.

A great, little sticker project for the children to collect stickers which my 7 year old loved (free). There is a lift for going up the tower.I bought the guide book but we didn't need it at all as there is loads of well presented information as you go around the exhibition. Some nice souvenirs in the shop as well as the opportunity for a professional photo and a funny machine that changes 1 pence coins in to special \"Tower Bridge\" coins!

The Tower Bridge Experience starts in the middle of the bridge (same side as the Tower of London) and consists of four main parts. After a ride (can be a bit of a packed elevator), you get to sit and watch a 5 minute, somewhat cheesy video about how the bridge came about. You can then walk along the walkways (only one side is currently open) to experience the rather obscured view, check out placards on one side about the history while the other side shows famous bridges across the world. I found myself more interested in the latter, but that view is even more obscured by the other walkway. At the far end is another video about the building of the bridge (only watched a few second), before you climb down to a level with another elevator that takes you back to the bridge. From here you walk to the end to the engine room building to get a view of steam operations of the bridge (make sure you keep your ticket, since you need it to enter here).I found the engine room the most interesting."

The area does get very crowded but the staff were efficient enough to keep things moving and the cost was reduced to match the fact that a small area is closed at the moment.

No reason to add the details as so many others have done, I will just say that it's truly inspirational to walk in the footsteps of giants. The men who conceived and created these elaborate Victorian structures were part of one of the greatest modern generations; a generation that left a tremendous intellectual legacy in the arts and sciences that hasn't been replicated since.These types of structures simply wouldn't be built today. A walk through the Tower Bridge gives one a good perspective on just how amazing the Victorians were, and just how far we have declined since that time. From the walkways one can see a comparison in those hideous concrete monstrosities that represent the nadir of 20th century design.Highly recommend the tour but maybe not during the weekends.

There are great views, lots and lots of history, beautiful architecture, and best of all it is all free! London Bridge is easy to access with so much public transport (tube, DLR, and bus) all being nearby. All of the open top bus tours also go over the bridge and stop on the northern side. It's great to walk across the bridge and take in the sights up and down the river along with the beauty of the bridge itself. Kids will love watching the bridge open an close, you can find out when this will happen (normally several times a day) by searching on Google. But there is more to the bridge than waking across it. There is more to see under either side, including the original steam room on the south side. There is also a museum in the north side of the bridge but you need to pay for this one. If you are travelling by tube your best bet is to get off at Tower Hill and walk down the Tower of London side of the bridge, cross over, and then walk back on the other side. Best time to see the bridge is a sunrise and the sun comes up over the river. The bridge is also one of the best places to get photos of the tower of London from. If you want to get a bus across the bridge but don't want to pay for the open top tours there is a bus stop on the north side of the bridge."

Hubby and I decided to go along to visit the Tower of London the other weekend to see the Poppies in the moat 'Blood swept lands seas of red ' display and it was wonderful. We arrived around 4.30pm in order to have a good look round the moat and then walked through to St Katherine's docks on a wonderful evening. We decided to opt for the fish and chips sold right next to the Tower for our tea and at \u00a37 a portion they were hot and good value. We the. Went round the docks which are within easy walking distance of the tower . Seeing the Queens brave on display was a bonus the docks were lovely . Lots of little shops restaurants and caf\u00e9s . We walked round along the Thames embankment and eventually did a whole circle in order to catch the 'Reading of the names' at sunset being 6.35pm that day and hearing the last post played was so touching.We walked back down along the the embankment past City Hall looking back at Tower Bridge now lit up in all it's glory. A wonderful evening and so memorable"

The guide was very informative on the journey up explaining how high we now were above the water.The brief introduction to the bridge was very informative although not to some people's tastes and allowed you to get some idea of what London was like before the bridge was built.Was a little disappointed that both walkways were not open but was still happy enough to walk along the East walkway, they did explain the at the West walkway was undergoing some reconstruction (one guide mentioned a hole in the floor, to which there was some nervous giggling). I enjoyed reading the boards along the walkway picking up little facts I had not known.The engine room was a sight to see, I was amazed that this is what helped the bridge to open and close in the past.Yes it was a little expensive for what there was to see but for the experience itself, I would quite happily pay it again.I, for one, am not good with heights but I felt happy and secure at all times especially as the walkways are enclosed.

Tower Bridge is a 5 minute walk from the Tower Hill tube station and there is a walkway which also goes past the Tower of London leading onto the bridge itself. A lift takes you to the top of the first tower where there is a short presentation and video on how the Tower was built in the 19th century. Then you go out on to the walkway where there is an exhibition on how the bridges of the world were constructed. This exhibition was surprisingly interesting. The walkway is all enclosed so views of the Thames are restricted and photography is limited because of the iron railings and windows. After that you go down the stairs to the engine room exhibition where you can walk around the bridge lifting mechanism. At the end there is a gift shop with a very good range of London souvenirs. The exit is on the other side of the Thames river and you can walk back over via the road bridge to the other side. Tower Bridge is most spectacular from the outside, while the interior is old and slightly run down. The exhibition is just worth the price of admission. There are toilet facilities at the end of the walkways. On reflection, this attraction may be better combined with a visit to the adjacent Tower of London."

Having made two previous trips to London, we were chagrined to miss Tower Bridge at those time, so made certain to visit on our third trip in September 2013. It was our first day in the city, and after hours of walking in Covent Garden, lunch, and time to see the Tower of London, it was at last time for Tower Bridge. There's really not quite any view like it around. Anywhere. The bridge is brilliant and beautiful. An architectural an engineering wonder. One could stand looking at it for hours--from different angles, the same vantage point, or from a location on the bridge itself. We enjoyed taking photos, although it was nearing sunset, and it was fun to see what an incredibly popular spot it is for couples and groups taking photos with the bridge as a backdrop. Visitors seemed in such a happy,upbeat mood around this amazing and inspiring sight. It brings out good feelings in just being around it. And better yet--it's free. It costs nothing to stand along the Thames and just admire what man has made. We even climbed the steps in order to take a walk to the middle of the bridge and look out over the Thames at the London skyline. Regardless of the reputation it may have as a tourist spot, Tower Bridge really is a must see. Anyone visiting the eastern end of London should count it as an essential stop."

So, I was tired of hiking up stairs by the time I got to the top and because it was the end of the day, it was quite crowded, so my mood might have been off a bit - the only reason I didn't give it an average rating is because it is such a world icon. The views from the top of London are wonderful, but the best photos of London have this bridge in it, so I would say it's best to experience the bridge from the bankside, rather than going to the top."

We knew that the western walkway would be closed. The box office is quite small, and fortunately we did not have to wait very long. The film show at the top of the north tower was probably about long enough and fairly light hearted. It was a bit of a grey day, so the views were not fantastic. I liked the little windows where you could poke your camera out and get a better shot. We did not see much point in the film show in the south tower, and proceeded to the engine room. This attraction is fragmented, well it is a bridge, and you need to follow the lines on the pavement. The engine room was very good, although not in use, it is a good exhibition peice.From an accessibility point of view, firstly both the carer and disabled person go free, pleasent surprise. There are stairs, but I think if you contacted the bridge in advance a wheelchair user would be able to see most of the exhibits. On the upper walkways the view would be obstructed for someone who is seated."

The tunnel is completely sealed so you are viewing inside of a glass tunnel but with parts of the bridge obstructing your view, terrible for pictures. The whole time the guides mention many times about the gift and souvenir shop, felt like or I should say, total tourist trap. Go to St Pauls and pay to goto the top of that, much better, London Eye or the Monument for other great views. You can also go visit the engine room (included in the price) to see the huge steam engines and pistons, that was some what interesting, which of course funnels you to the gift shop.

You could then use the toilets and collect a photo if you had had one taken and then it was another ten minute wait for a lift to take you downstairs where once outside on the bridge you had to follow a blue line to the engine room which was the last part of the tour - I saw visitors just leaving the attraction at this point.

Once you have completed the towers display, you are treated to the bowels of the operation where you see how it all operates with the wonderful 18th century steam driven machines that enable the drawbridge to operate to allow the larger vessels access through the Thames. This is an A1 attraction and well worth the fee of entry. This is a world icon and the tour is well organised and demonstrated. Also, there are great views out over the Thames.

Going into the bridge exhibition is the only way to see its steel core, how it works, and enjoy great views from the high level walkway. We needed Wikipedia for technical information, and some engineering facts presented in the exhibition were inaccurate or confusing.The views from the high level walkway were a splendid way to see the city, and we enjoyed examining the steel structure of the bridge which is hidden by the masonry.There\u2019s only limited information about how the bridge was built and how it works. One film which claims to show how the bridge was built is inaccurate at times, and conflicts with photos of the construction. E.g. a photo taken during construction shows the bascules being built in the vertical position so as not to block the river, while the modern film shows them being built while lowered, thus blocking the river.On entry do check when the bridge will open. If you\u2019re on the high level walkway, you can just see the bridge below, and it\u2019s a unique experience to watch it opening from above.No food is sold here. There\u2019s one block of toilets (excellent cleanliness) which you reach by steps down when you are ready to leave the high level walkway (lift available for the disabled).Overall, the visit to the iconic structure is a delight, and a chance to see it up close, but if the engineering interests you, I\u2019d suggest you\u2019ll also want to read the Wiki article, which will tell you a lot more. It\u2019s rather expensive to visit, but is probably the most famous bridge in the world.Special Warning: when we visited we noted a number of gangs running the 3 cup scam [see shell game in Wiki] around the Bridge.

The Victorian Gothic pylons are a brick facade. What is behind these are steel girders - all a little to ugly for the Victorians apparently. The Bridge was never bombed in the second WW as the Germans used it as a navigational aid. The engine room is fascinating. A series of boilers were used to burn cola to create steam which in turn ran hydraulic lifts for the bridge road way. It is of course now run by electric engines but the old steam engines are real beauties. TIP: Purchase your tickets on line and you can attend any time on the day."

Luckily the lift door opened so I was able to escape before I was forced to take action, the staff seemed impotent to intervene even though they were inches away, just looking on and when I told the woman operating the lift what happened she just looked at me blankly.The gift shop was reasonable, I bought my son a magnet and a badge. To get to the engine room/gift shop level you have to follow the blue line to use a small lift which is signed but hardly noticeable, after you go down you continue to follow the blue line to the engine room, one of the engines moves which facinated my son, there was a short film which he also enjoyed. The were models on the wall which he could turn handles to operate which he also enjoyed. They also gave my son a sticker card and he collected stickers from around the bridge and gift shop, but we had to keep a keen eye out for staff to ask even though my son was clutching the card in his hand.However, all in all a nice visit and would come again another year."

The best and the worse thing happened at the same time.The best thing is I happened to witness the ceremony in remembrance of the british heroes who died during the WWI and there was an centenary event, the venue garden was full with ceramic poppies. After that I went up to the bridge and took out my SD card and replaced with a new one.When I got home from the trip I found the SD card which was taken out was not in my bag! It was gone. The card contained a previous trip with my husband in Italy (our first travel in Europe), and a first time marathon memory in medoc, France, and Lyon with a long-time friend, and my first visit in London. I just despairingly hope if someone happen to find a card around the area will see my message and drop me a reply.."

Multimedia is the curse of modern museums - if you don't put a lot of effort in, it's worse than useless - and the video that starts this attraction off is terrible. The rest of the exhibit isn't really about he bridge, more about London history, but it's nice to walk across the top, even though the views are marred by dirty plexiglass (there are sliding camera ports) and you can't go onto outside walkways or see the real guts of the bridge (except for the engine room section). Moderately priced, so worth it."

Unless you are in to the engineering aspect of the bridge, which I guess is the only real reason you'd want to go, then don't bother.There are a couple of interactive areas, talking picture frames and the like.

To visit this exhibit is not cheap, but you do get a unique perspective on Tower Bridge - up on the walkway above the bridge road surface there has been an attempt to create an interesting exhibition about the creation of the Bridge, but it does need some work. The first area as you exit the lifts is a mock up of a meeting between the Bridge Architect and Queen Victoria. Once you have passed through this, you are on the walkway itself where there are simply white display boards with information about the designs proposed, the construction of and then the opening of the bridge, After that there are more boards of pictures of other famous bridges. There is the ubiquitous \"photo\" area, before a small cinema area situated at the far end of the walkway. Then you pass into the second walkway - which for some bizarre reason is about 60's London?!The children were given a small \"passport\" to collect stickers of the Bridge.Pretty poor really. After passing swiftly through the large \"photo shop\" - photos \u00a310 + each - you walk down and out of the Tower, aong the bridge and down underneath the Tower to the engine room (passing buy a much larger shop!) this obviously was very interesting - it has all the old machinery that was once used to power the bascule bridge opening. But it is no longer in use.The most interesting bit was obviously the opening of the bridge itself which we were lucky to see. It really is a fabulous sight! And also seeing the bridge lit up at night!The organizers should visit some other exhibits to see how much more could be made of this opportunity."

The bridge is stunning from the water and if you go to the bridge website you'll see the opening times which looks really cool. The HMS Belfast is moored between the Tower bridge and the London Bridge which adds an even nicer pic of the Tower Bridge. Definitely worth a trip down the Thames to see the marvelous world renown bridge from the water."

The steam room isn't that interesting if you are not into that kind of thing but it is good to see it. Kids get a little passport type thing where they get stickers at 4 points during the visit to stick on. My daughter loved that!!It is not as impressive in the towers than outside, but to be honest it was not made for people to tour it. This was the second time we have been in 2 years as my daughter loves going in there.Yes not a big attraction but worth a visit and a cheap attraction to visit in comparison to others in. London!"

We bought our tickets online in advance for this, which ended up being brilliant, because it was massively crowded the day we visited and we were able to bypass the line (queue) nearly altogether, pick up our tickets at the counter, and go straight up to the high level viewing platforms where we enjoyed an interesting pictorial exhibition chronologizing the bridge's history and also saw some stunning views of the River Thames and London skyline! For the best experience and if you're able to do it, I strongly recommend taking the STAIRS all the way up and down instead of the elevator (lift) because it is far less crowded, affords you an appreciation of how high the bridge really is, and also offers additional wonderful views through the windows on the way up! Of course, the most impressive thing about this bridge is that it's a drawbridge, so it's a real treat to see it raise to allow a large or high masted ship to pass through. TIP: check the Tower Bridge website for the Bridge Lift Times (a tab on the top) before you go so that you can time your visit to be ON THE GROUND to see it best when it lifts and lowers!! It's quite a spectacle and lots of fun to watch front & center (see attached photo). If it wasn't so awfully crowded and they would better limit the number of people that could see it at any given time, I would rate this 5 stars."

The Tower Bridge tour is well worth it and affords you superb views from high up in the structure - up and down stream and across the Tower of London - which would have been even more mind-blowing for the first 19th Century Londoners who had the energy to climb the steps during the many daily bridge lifts then. The Tower Bridge tour also memorably demonstrates the pioneering lifting machinery and other aspects of the workings of this extraordinary structure.

When you first arrive don't take the lazy option and go up in the lift, step back outside to the left and go up the stairs the way the Victorians did. It really adds to the feel of the building and sets you up for what is ahead. The tour starts with a short video about the origins, design and building of this iconic bridge. Walk along the East walkway and take in both the views and also the masses of information on display. At the top of the south tower there is a brief video showing the construction of the bridge, remember to look up and see the models of the builders and ask the staff about the facts of figures of the bridge and it's history. Go along the West walkway where there is an exhibition of London icons inc Carnaby St, The Who and others.Head down in the lift and walk the short distance to the Victorian engine rooms, these are fascinating and show just how ingenious the builders and engineers of the time were.

Both spans are covered from the elements and contain interesting facts and information relating to this and other famous bridges around the world and also some historical features.

You then have the choice of two walkways at the top; the east one features some great pictures of famous bridges, whilst the western one is an exhibit of 60's pictures. Whilst the pictures are great, the reason for walking to the top was to take photos outside, not to look at them indoors. Yes you can take photos but only through some very small open windows/grills.You can then get a lift down via the South tower to ground floor and a short walk by following a blue line brings you to the Engine Rooms.

It is very many years since I have been to the Tower Bridge Exhibition and it has changed almost as much as the London skyline. There are two good video presentations, one in each tower, the first dealing with the need for the crossing and the architecture of the bridge and the second with the innovative building technology. It is, of course, the walkways which command greatest attention and there are a vast number of information boards to identify the sights although the history and development of the bridge (along with the discounted schemes) are also addressed and the second walkway has lots of very interesting cultural information, currently a brilliant 60s exhibition. There are lots of open windows which permit glass-less photographs which is helpful. What still amazes me, though, is the quality of decorative stone and metal features at 150+ feet. The sights are remarkable but demonstrate that London and the City of London haven\u2019t always been quite in tune with getting their new architecture right \u2013 no change there, then\u2026 Some of the more recent \u2018iconic\u2019 buildings are an indifferent bunch whilst the \u201cShard\u2019 is quite remarkable for its shape and the fact that it is south of the river. It is a shame that those in the City dwarf and spoil the views of the very much more iconic Tower of London although it is interesting to see the other bridges too from this viewpoint. When looking at the river, the views are ever-changing. Many of the tourists I spoke to were surprised to discover that it is very much a working river and could see tugs pulling many barges as well as lots of pleasure craft and river ferries. The photos speak for themselves. The trip ends with a trip to the engine rooms and the shop - although we decided to leave that for the next visit.N.B. The upstream side of Tower Bridge [nearest the Tower of London] faces WNW so if you want to take photos to the West do so in the morning and vice versa. [P.S. Having walked over London Bridge to get to Tower Hill I realised that I must be one of the few who have walked over the Victorian stone arch bridge in London as a teenager and then again in Lake Havasu City in Arizona not that long ago.]"

Had wanted to go inside the bridge for several years and enjoyed it.Staff at the ticket office were not the friendliest but we got our tickets, passed security check, and made our way into the Tower.There are lots of steps (lift available if required) views getting better as you climb up, the structure inside is amazing, such a shame its all hidden away, very grand staircases as you proceed up to the top.When you reach the top, there is a short video about the history and why/how the bridge was designed, you can then walk through and along the walkways, to the other side.There are display in both sides, neither of which are that interesting, and are starting to fade. The one side had images of other great bridges, and again the history of the bridge. At the other Tower another short video greeted us. Then back along the other walkway to see pictures of images of London. Whilst here we also witnessed the bridge open for a couple of boats to pass through.After returning to the outside world, we had a short walk to the engine room, which was very well presented, the displays here were interesting and simple to read and understand on how the old engines worked. Some of the interactive displays at the end were not working though!Then out into the shop.Would have loved the chance to walk on the outside walkway across the bridge - not sure if this is every available to do or not?"

After climbing the 206 stairs (lift u/s) we saw the film which wasn't quite as cheesy as I had feared...it presented the facts in an easily digested fashion for non-techies. For us techies there was plenty to admire in the Victorian structure revealed beneath the Portland Stone skin of the Towers. The walkways afforded spectacular views...Wembley Stadium one way, Crystal Palace TV mast the other. The sun was low in the sky and gave amazing views over HMS Belfast and towards The Shard. The restored but still steam engines were magnificent and, as we left, the bridge opened to let a cruise liner through! It was the icing on the cake of a most interesting experience."

The introductory film was interesting, as was the film in the other tower. walking across the bridge was not that exciting, a bit of a display of other bridges and a nostalgic trip back to the 60's. The architecture was impressive both inside and out.When we left it was nearly time to raise the bridge, it was decided to sit on a bench near the tower of London and watch the opening of the bridge to allow a tall sailing ship pass through."

This part was a little dull, the information was okay but it was as though the had run out of things to put, so decided to put pictures of bridges all over the world up. The 2nd walk way was photos of the 60's,70's etc. This was a little more interesting. We also had our photo taken, which you could then buy at a later date.Once at the end of this part of the tour, we were told to walk out of the building and follow the blue line on the floor. This took us to the engine room. We had a walk around that, though it wasn't anything special. Overall i don't think the tour was worth the money i paid, it killed an hour of time, but it wasn't anything special."

            "review": "Tower Bridge - A bridge that needs no introduction. Tower Bridge is probably the most easily recognisable bridge in the world. It seems everyone knows the image of Tower Bridge, even those who confuse its name with the nearby London Bridge. It is one of the iconic and worldly images of England and something that all first time visitors should try to experience. Built between 1886 to 1894, Tower Bridge takes its name from the nearby Tower of London, which is literally right next to the bridge on the north side of the River Thames. The bridge features two towers, each 65 meters tall with a central span of 61 meters, which can be raised to allow vessel traffic to pass. Designed by English architect Sir Horace Jones in Baronial style, the two towers resemble and are in harmony with the Tower of London architecture. The structure is quite photogenic during the day when you can take in lovely images of the Tower Bridge and Tower of London together from the promenade in Southwark. At night, the bridge is hit with floodlights, which illuminate it for quite some distance. Again, this makes for lovely opportunities to take memorable photographs of Tower Bridge. You can walk across Tower Bridge, enjoying this iconic landmark as well as many nice views of the city seen from here. You can also enter and experience the Tower Bridge Exhibition (\u00a39.00 per adult, \u00a33.90 for children) and walkways which stretch between the two towers. This can be a fun thing to do for families, and it can be conveniently done before or after visiting the Tower of London just a short walk to the north side of the Thames. In the end, this is one of 'true' must-see attractions in London, even if you don't spend much time at or near Tower Bridge. Up there with Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben), Parliament and Buckingham Palace, having a look at Tower Bridge is something everyone should make sure to include in their trip itinerary during your first trip to London."

The bridge architecture is very grand with its unique design and function. So photogenic and to see this icon bridge lift is impressive close up. It is a quick tour inside to see how it works and to get some of the history of the place. It is perfect as a trip as part of your day out - glad we went. A gruesome fact is this is the area that over the centuries bodies have washed up to due to tidal changes - don't worry you won't see any on your tour."

Both galleries exhibitions were of interest to me \u2013 the western gallery with famous bridges of the world and the eastern gallery with the Sixties. After you proceed back to ground level, you can enter the Victoria Engine Rooms. There is also a short video showing construction of the bridge.

We could overlook so many beautiful sights from top (along with view of Thames) and it was majestic. I stayed in London for over a month and visited tower bridge close to 20 times. Surprisingly, I didn't get bore with this. Every time I visited tower bridge I found it equally beautiful and charming.So, If you are in London.. don't miss tower bridge."

The introduction of the architect and the story of the bridge is entertaining. Even my teenage niece and nephew were amused. The rest of the tour was a self guided tour. Several interesting videos and interactive displays. I enjoyed the info of the Amazing Bridges of the World. The very best part of the self guided tour is the original machinery used to raise and lower the bridge is on display. It is restored to perfection. There is delicate beauty to all the gears and gadgets of the machinery . This is SteamPunk at it's best. The views from the Tower Bridge are outstanding. You have a pilots view of the Thames River. The Tower Bridge Tour is definitely worth a visit for all ages"

Currently \u00a39 a head, but here is top tip, my train company does 2 for 1 offers, check yours before you travel, quite a few offerings. The out of service steam installations are interesting, one is, as usual, driven so you can see it in motion, overall, highly recommended.

On a hot and humid July day there is little air up there (you would expect a great breeze but the bridge spans are covered in). Going down is the problem. On a busy day you are confined into a small, hot, unorganized area where 25 people at a time get to take the lift down because the stairs do not take you to street/bridge level. Not for the claustrophobic or those who don't like the heat."

But that view is for free and easily obtained by a good walk or a million vistas that show it off. The exhibition is worth the time if part of a London Pass, but otherwise in my opinion not worth the ticket price for a family. We had purchased a 1-day London Pass, itself only a good value only if you pack a lot into every day you use it (we toured the War Rooms, Westminster Abbey, Globe Theater, Tower Bridge and the Tower in one day). So something like the Tower Bridge became a sunk cost and worth the view. If you are doing the London Eye (another vista that is expensive for what you get), you will have much better views of the City. I rated the Bridge a 3 and my daughters (age 14, 19 & 23) rated it a 2 for the price / value."

You then see a nice simple quick graphic that shows the bridge being built. This was my favourite part. Then you can view a clip on how the bridge works showing how it opens ad closes. The engine rooms are open for viewing and you are able to walk Round and get a good look at each engine. Then it is onto the Tower Bridge Road that has black and white photographs of influential people from the sixties from England. E.g Twiggy, The Beatles. Rolling Stones.

We got in and waited for our elevator ride up. Once up, both sides have splendid views as you walk along. Note that there are a few openings along the window where you can use your camera and not have any window glare! Loved that. After walking along both sides went all the way down to the engine room and marveled at those engines. It was a great visit and really an hour is all you need."

This was included in our London Pass so we did not have to pay separate admission. We entered the ticket office without having to wait, got our tickets and waited <10 minutes for the elevator ride to the top of the first tower. We saw a brief video narration about the towers origins and then walked across the top span, allowing you to see up and down the Thames. Many wall hangings show you other types of bridges around the world and help you learn about bridge construction and design. At the far tower, there is an animated movie that shows the stages of construction in time lapse which was fascinating (especially for my civil engineer daughter). You finish the above ground tour by crossing back and forth across the upriver span of the bridge which looks west over the city. After taking the stairs back down to street level, you can cross to the bank and continue your tour of the engine room that shows the history of the mechanism that lifts the bridge spans. It only takes a few additional minutes, is worth the time and rarely has long lines."

Walk on the bridge crossing the River Thames taking a glimpse of the warship 'Belfast' in a fair distance. Stop on the bridge just to watch River Thames and the London cityscape.

The views of the city are lovely from here and the atmosphere lively and fun. My 11 yr old just loved walking across and back and forth and viewing the city and the Tower from here. a FREE attraction that should not be missed. At the bottom along the Thames, there are shops and eateries as well. while by the Thames, go to the water and find your own London treasure! The Thames was actually the dumping ground of London before they had sewerage and you can still find ancint treasures pieces in the sand off the Thames. Coins, metal, glass, anything....kids LOVE it!! And it's a piece of history that you can't buy in a shop!"

Arriving at Tower Bridge mid-morning in June, I was expecting a long queue, especially as it was the bridge's 120th anniversary, with tickets at only \u00a31.20 on the day. The ticket office is at the base of the northern tower (on the Tower of London side of the river) & luckily we only waited 10 minutes to get in. The RV1 bus takes you from Waterloo, down Tooley Street, and right across Tower Bridge, or you can travel by Tube. After purchasing your ticket, you go up the north tower, either via the stairs or the lift. A short film is shown at the top, then you can walk along the East and West Walkways above the bridge. On the East side, there are pictures & info about famous world bridges, while on the West there is currently a great 60s exhibition, with large boards depicting fashion, cars, & famous people from that era. Both sides are enclosed by girders and glass, apart from a few small windows which you can open to take photos of the great river views. I was very excited to be up on the walkways on such a special day, especially as Tower Bridge was built around the time that my Grandmother was born near by in the East End of London. From the social history viewpoint, it was easy to imagine her parents & family battling to cross the crowded sole London Bridge, before Tower Bridge was constructed.It takes about 2 hours to look around, and I wouldn't really take young children. Toilets are available inside. 3 short films are shown, at the beginning, middle and end.Without exception the staff were extremely friendly, helpful and cheerful, and nothing was too much trouble. I especially enjoyed the costumed characters who spoke to us & made us laugh as we went around.When you come out, the Engine room is about 50 yards down the road, with a blue line on the ground to follow. I thought the small shop was very well stocked with a wide range of souvenirs. Several other London sights are close by - the Tower of London to the north, and the Shard, City Hall, HMS Belfast, & Old Operating Theatre on the South bank. There are several places for a meal or a snack (Starbucks, Cote etc) and the Globe Theatre and Tate Modern are a 30 minute walk further along the Southbank, towards Waterloo. I thoroughly enjoyed this visit & found it thrilling to be high up on the actual walkways of such an iconic bridge."

I am biased I know, as to me Tower Bridge has always been second to none anywhere in the world since I was a child...... but saying that, for any visitor to London, whether from abroad or from other areas of the UK, it really is an experience not to be missed and, as attractions go it's not unreasonably priced. It was \u00a39 for me as an adult, my husband got \u00a32.50 off for being over 60! The initial film show.. only a few minutes long explaining how the bridge came about is clearly geared for those with short attention spans and is a bit gimmicky but at least you get the idea of why the bridge was needed and how it ended up being a bascule bridge.The 'wow' factor is the view from the walk ways linking the two towers. Looking back down the river towards Strafford and then up the river towards Westminster you get astoundingly clear and good views. The view towards The City and its new buildings - The 'walkie talkie', 'the cheese grater' and 'gherkin' is superb and of course The Shard dominates the south bank views. I personally think you get a better perspective from Tower Bridge... The Shard views are magnificent but everything looks 'model' sized you are so high up, from Tower Bridge is all looks very real and very dramatic.The second video show is about the construction of the bridge and I found that interesting plus the model workers above on the girders showed how dangerous it would have been for them... they say 'only'!! 10 men died during the construction.The engine room is not to be missed.... apart from the pristine condition and glorious paintwork.... it is stunning to see what is needed to raise the spans.There are plenty of places to sit and have a coffee afterwards looking back up at where you have just walked afterwards."

Takes about an hour or little over if you read all the signs, and enjoy the view from the upper walk ways. (Albeit the london eye would be better for view). The tour provides some brief but good historical information about the bridge. If you like engineering feats and/or bridges, you enjoy the tour despite short and enjoy the pictures on the upper walkway of other world famous bridges. Priced reasonably at 9# per adult, and to see a feat of 19th century work, you have no reason to not stop by. It is worth it. Plus, it's next door to the tower of London."

Tower Bridge (built 1886\u20131894) is a combined bascule and suspension bridge which crosses the River Thames. It is close to the Tower of London, from which it takes its name, and has become an iconic symbol of London.The bridge consists of two towers tied together at the upper level by means of two horizontal walkways, designed to withstand the horizontal forces exerted by the suspended sections of the bridge on the landward sides of the towers. The vertical component of the forces in the suspended sections and the vertical reactions of the two walkways are carried by the two robust towers. The bascule pivots and operating machinery are housed in the base of each tower. The bridge's present colour scheme dates from 1977, when it was painted red, white and blue for Queen Elizabeth II's silver jubilee. Originally it was painted a mid greenish-blue colourTower Bridge is still a busy and vital crossing of the Thames: it is crossed by over 40,000 people (motorists, cyclists and pedestrians) every day.The bridge featured in publicity for the 2012 Summer Olympics being held in London. In June 2012 a set of Olympic rings was suspended from the bridge to mark one month to go until the start of the games."

As this card is giving you free access to many attractions, including Tower Bridge Exhibition, we used this chance to visit it. First you will see a presentation movie about the bridge construction, which we actually did not want to watch as there were a lot of students watching it, meaning that at the end of it, it would have been very crowed and noisy all around, so we went directly above the Tower Bridge, crossing both corridors and reading some of the multiples informations which are presented inside them. Actually, the best moment is when you are crossing those corridors, because each time you will see Tower Bridge from outside, you will remember that you were there !We took some photos and I will soon post them with my review for you to see and understand how it looks like. After the corridors, you descend stairs to reach ground floor and follow outside a blue line on the floor to see then engines room, which was for me not very interesting I should admit...Well, it worths to be seen once, I did it but I'm not interested to do it again.So, enjoy your visit of Tower Bridge Exhibition and maybe see you once in London ;-)otterboris"

Compared with my review elsewhere of the Cutty Sark at Greenwich, the interpretation of how the bridge worked in steam days is - er - woeful. The film shows explaining its conception are brilliant. And I do know a thing or two about boilers, steam engines and hydraulic pumps and motors. But I found the display boards baffling. I presume that if I knew nothing about how these things worked, I would be utterly puzzled. The texts were OK and accurate, but the graphics were terrible. Once upon a time in my life I was a technical illustrator, so I do have knowledge and experience about how to represent systems (e.g. atomic power electricity generation), plus how stuff works - the machinery.This isn't a plug. but if the Tower Bridge Exhibition curators would like to get in touch with me as to how they could improve things, I wouldn't turn them down.The 60s exhibition in the walkeway was a good retrospective of those times (I was a teenager then so I'm acutely aware of the social impact of the things they chose to highlight). Well done. The display of the most important, groundbreaking bringes, also on the walkway, was also very, very good. What disappointed me was a crowd of a dozen or more Dutch school party trippers (I speak Dutch) who whizzed through end-to-end texting on their mobile phones, took the odd picture out of the walkway windows, and, well, I don't know what great historic place they were going to visit next that they would skim over with the lightest iof touches. The fact that they were all female is not of any relevance to me - even though I'm a man, I'm a feminist. What a missed opportunity for them to learn so much. But that's not Tower Bridge's problem. Just a problem for a visitor taking a lot of interest in the place."

We had purchased the London Pass which includes admission to the Tower Bridge Exhibition. Normal admission is \u00a39.00 for an adult. There are a few short films on the tour and you are able to walk across the upper bridge portion to view exhibits and information on the building of the bridge, other famous bridges in the World, etc. One portion of the exhibit when we were there had to do with the 1960s, just iconic images of that time period. It was ok, but we found ourselves skipping most of that portion. You can get some nice photos through the little windows you can open in the upper bridge portion. We were then able to exist and be escorted over to the Engine Rooms which were also interesting to see. TIP: If you'd like to see the Tower Bridge actually open, then refer to this website for opening dates and times http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/BridgeLiftTimes/. We checked the schedule ahead of time and planned our visit so we could see it open. Had the pleasure of seeing an old mast ship pass through!TIP: Don't just visit the bridge during the daytime for photo. If you want some spectacular photos, go back to the area at night, cross the bridge and go to the other side of the River to take some beautiful night photos of the bridge lit up (along with the Tower of London). It is absolutely gorgeous at night!"

There were two exhibits at the top, one showing different iconic bridges, and the other was life in the 60's. They wouldn't have been worth the price of admission alone, but just getting to see the inside of the bridge, and the machinery room further up the street was worth it. You also get great views from the top of the bridge, and they have little windows that open so you can get photos without the glare from the glass."

Tower bridge is further East and its the one which opens.The Tower bridge consists of two towers tied together and thats why the name .There is Tower Bridge Exhibition for which you should pay. If you are too keen for engine rooms and all go for the exhibition.The best part is the walking through the bridge and the amazing views.

Amazing to think about how recently this bridge was built. An interesting story about how the bridge mechanism works. We'd visited Armstrong's (the developer of the bascule mechanism I believe) mansion in Cragside and learned something about the engineer. To see the mechanisms in action made all that history come alive. I'd recommend a visit especially to people interested in history and how things work. It's not worth the entry fee if all you want is a view. You can get that from the nearby Millenium Bridge or from a walk along the Thames bank."

One of the employees (wish I remembered his name) escorted us down and took the time to make sure we got to the engine room which was a confusing and difficult route since we where unable to take the stairs."

I really enjoyed it, a very nice presentation with an interactive movie at the beginning, very nicely done and not boring at all, then we went through the walkaways with an exhibition about the bridges of the world, which was really nice and had fantastic views of Thames river. On the other side, the tower with the victorian machines, which is even if you think you won\u00b4t be interested at all, really wonderful to see, even my mom who is not interested at all in big machinery, was really into seeing how they used to work and love it! I would definetely recommend it! We bought the souvenir photo at the end! it\u00b4s a little bit expensive but totally worth it!"

Naturally, we got excited for this extra bonus. The bascule is lifted 3x/day on scheduled times. It would be ideal to know the times for the lifting of the drawbridge. You can get this information from the ticket booth. We just got lucky that there was an incoming boat at 11am. It was nice to know the history & some random facts about the Tower Bridge & London in general (icons of music, fashion, modeling, entertainment were featured on one side of the walkway). I liked how they presented & categorized the iconic bridges in the world as to the origin, composition, type of bridge, construction, reconstruction, etc. I like the Tower Bridge exhibition. If you love science, particularly engineering & architecture, you will highly appreciate this iconic bridge. The bridge is still functional up to this day."

Because of this, they probably don't feel they need to do much to attract visitors and maybe they are right. Indeed, the views are fab and will always be worth it. BUT, I really feel that the 'experience' needs modernising. You go in a lift (elevator) packed like sardines - not for the claustrophobic! You arrive and there is a short film which is entertaining and interesting. Then you wander across the walkways and admire the views. They have display panels about all the other cool bridges in the world (so good for bridge fans) and for some reason, about London in the 60s. They seem rather desperate to provide something for your money so even have display boards about birds you might see or fish that might live in the Thames below. It's all a bit strained really - as if they are trying to justify the money they have taken off you by providing something, anything. You end with a silent film about the design of the bridge which is yawningly boring. I just feel that something more exciting is needed these days to justify the entrance fee - or else reduce the price and keep it as a plain no frills viewing platform."

Since we started at the gift shop, we'd already spend 20 pounds there. They wouldn't give us the discount after the fact even though it was the gift shop person who told us to do the tour backwards!

I don't mean literally across the top of it but look up - there's two pedestrian bridges high up. The entry fee was quite reasonable when we went -\u00a39 each. You get a couple of audio visual presentations in the tops of the towers, two galleries (in the east and west foot bridges) and a trip around the original steam powered engine rooms that were used to lift the centre span of the bridge when it was originally built. It was here that I learned (a) what a bascule bridge is and (b) that tower bridge is one of them.Tip 1: if you see a herd of school kids waiting in line, come back later. Tip 2: you can actually do the tour backwards by buying your ticket at the engine room on the south side of the bridge and doing that before going up in the towers.

I myself think that the most interesting part of the visit was the old engine room but taking a walk on the upper platforms is neat in and of itself. If you have limited time and this is your first visit, you might want to invest more time at the Tower of London but, Tower Bridge is a nice stop over especially if you can see it being raised/lowered (I'm originally from Chicago so moving bridges are hardly new to me)."

            "review": "Fine views, with interesting displays attached. Tower Bridge is such an icon of London that I couldn't resist the chance to have a closer look. There is a lift up to the viewing platforms but the queue for it was long and unmoving so I decided to take the stairs - all 267 of them. It's a great way to see the structure of the towers, and there are comfy seats at intervals so you can sit down if (or, more likely, when) you get tired, but there's no denying that it's a long, steep climb, so think carefully before allowing your impatience to get the better of you as mine did!At the top there are displays on the history and construction of Tower Bridge (very interesting) and on the history of bridge-building in general (less so, although there are some nice photos of bridges of the world); there is also a temporary display on 60s London which might be of more interest to overseas visitors, as most British people will have seen these photos dozens of times before. I couldn't fault the music, though!Back on the ground you can look around the engine rooms, showing how the bridge was powered when it was first built, with everything shiny clean and quiet and looking more like beautiful sculptures than like engines built to do a job of work.Even if you have no real interest in history or engineering, Tower Bridge comes highly recommended for the views alone: from the two viewing platforms you can look up and down the River Thames and across London, with displays on each platform telling you what you can see. Even on a rather grey, gloomy day the views are truly memorable, and worth the entry fee by themselves."

A lift takes you to the first part of the exhibition - a short, amusing video about the history of the bridge, then you go on to the wlkways at the top of the bridge, one of which has 'bridges from around the world'. Views are very good and present great photo opportunities. You have your photo taken against a green screen, with the option to buy (bit expensive), but there's no pressure to buy. You then go to the engine rooms which are impressive. All in all, a good way to spend an hour, and you can do the exhibition at your own pace."

The reason for 4 stars is the fact that we paid \u00a39 each to go into the exhibition they have and that was a bit of a disappointment. Way too expensive for what it is, so I don't recommend the exhibition, just the outside of the bridge. First we went all the way up to the bridge where there were some big pictures of different bridges around the world and explanations about this bridge itself. It is an enclosed space so you can't see much outside if you are short like me; then you go down and you can visit the space where the engines are. My husband was quite interested in that bit but to be honest, I wouldn't recommend spending \u00a39 just to see that. If you take pictures outside of the bridge, that's where the fun is. We also experienced the bridge being lifted for a ship to pass which was quite nice but then again, you don't need to pay to see that. All in all, a lovely place."

If you feel brave you can take the stairs but I believe there is an elevator available as well. The view from the top is not really spectacular, we were quite disappointed and left pretty quickly. You get to wander from one side of the bridge to the other on one side (and back on the other side I believe) and there are lots of pictures of bridges from all over the world displayed as well. You also get to see the old steam engine room but for that you have to leave the bridge and walk for a couple minutes before you get to the entrance to that. It's very small and doesn't take up much time to view but it is definitely worth it. We enjoyed it much more than the actual bridge. So if you have a couple more minutes to spare, keep your Tower Bridge ticket and take that stroll to the steam engine rooms."

It would have been good to go down to see the space where the weights that help raise the bridge are but, I suppose, Health and Safety issues prevent this. I would highly recommend anyone to go and learn about this world famous, iconic feature."

The engineering is remarkable and it is still as functional as it was about 120 years ago (completed in 1894). The video presentation at the start of the experience was both educational and entertaining. The walk across both of the spans offers outstanding unimpeded views of London but also has some great information about some of the other great bridges of the world. Upon completion, take the time to go across the bridge and see the engine rooms...immaculately clean and provides a real understanding of the brilliance fo the steam engineering that was used to drive the bascules to permit the passing of river traffic. A 'must-do' when in London."

You move from room to room on your own time and get to walk along the bridge on both sides to see views of the city through plexiglas enclosures. There are small sliding windows for clear picture taking. There is a short film that shows the inception, design, and building of the bridge structure and drawbridge features which are large enough to let cruise ships pass. The fun part to me was going down into the engine rooms where you can walk around the drawbridge motors and see the mighty engine powered mechanisms that open and close the center spans.

Then, you get to cross the bridge from above, and get a sight of London from the top of the bridge. When you walk along the 2 pathways, there are a lot of articles about the history of the Tower Bridge, as well as other famous bridges around the world. There is also a presentation that you can watch that narrates how the bridge was constructed. There is also an Engine exhibit which gives people an idea how the bride was operated during the early years.Unfortunately, we were not able to witness the actual opening of the bridge's gate for ships to pass underneath the bridge. But it would definitely be one good sight if we had the chance.This is a very nice sight to go to, especially in the night where it is nicely illuminated. A definite symbol of London."

I think it helped that it was a lovely sunny winter's day in London and the city looked gorgeous from the top galleries. You get to these by lift operated by a friendly guide and via a short film of the history of the bridge. The galleries have pictures and information about various landmarks and opening viewing windows (including some at lower heights for kids and short people like me) to take photographs through. Finally at the end is a \"photo opportunity\" where you can have a novelty picture taken to be collected later.After another short film about the construction of the bridge it's down to the next level by stairs. There is one loo and what is laughingly called the refreshment area, which consists of a vending machine. Before descending by lift you can purchase your novelty photo which costs roughly an arm and a leg.Another friendly guide advises you to hang on to your ticket as you exit onto Tower Bridge and walk along to go beneath the other tower. Handing in your ticket you are immediately into the old engine room, which fans of steam will enjoy immensely. Then on to various displays on how the bridge works followed by the inevitable gift shop. All in all, excellent value for money and a very pleasant way to spend a bright Saturday morning."

At his age his attention-span is short and I didn't want to pay a small fortune for something he would quickly be bored by and guessed the free museums would be rammed. This is affordable and you can move through fairly quickly if necessary. According to the lady on reception there were plenty of grandparents there with the same idea, possibly tempted by the reduced entry-price of \u00a35.60 (down from \u00a38) for over-60s!He was reasonably engaged by the filmed introduction and happy to look at the views from the crosswalks, but not really terribly interested in the various displays and artwork as he was a little too young, although he liked some of the models. Some fascinating stuff there for adults, but I would suggest going without any little people in tow if you would like to linger and take in all the historical stuff. However all the children are given a cardboard 'passbook' on arrival, and collect stickers to fill it in as they go round. He really liked this and was very pleased with the finished result.The parts he enjoyed most were the engine room - he loves anything to do with wheels and machinery so was happy to watch the pistons go round - and the couple of child-sized demonstration models where they can wind a wheel and it shows how the hydraulic system raises and lowers the bridge.Nice gift shop, not cheap - are they ever? - but when we initially went into the exhibition we were given a voucher for \u00a32 off a \u00a34 spend which was a nice touch and sugared the pill somewhat. Overall a good choice - older children there were generally more engaged with the exhibits and they all seemed to like the sticker card, regardless of their ages - and by the time we'd walked back to London Bridge along the nice wide stretch of embankment (enough room for him to run off any latent excess energy and thankfully it had stopped raining) it was probably the right amount of time and concentration for a child his age. He enjoyed the experience and so did I."

The bridge walks between the two towers was spectacular with great views overlooking the river Thames. There are lifts so access is easy. The ticket price also included a visit to the original engine room which powered the bridge, this was a feat of engineering and left you marvelling at the skill of the early day engineers, designers and builders of London Bridge. Suggest you allow 2 hours for a leisurely visit. The only comment is that I would have liked to have seen an information board giving times of the bridge lift. Well worth a visit."

You can walk across the bridge itself and you should do that to get a sense of the history and majesty of the bridge. But we are a bit undecided on the value of walking between the towers of the bridge itself and the exhibition (and paying for that). We were not too interested in the engine room aspects of the bridge and skipped that - if you were into engineering, that would probably interest you. Both the walkways were entirely covered (you walked from one end to the other, then back on the 2nd walkway, then back again on the 2nd walkway to get to the engine room) and had great views of the Thames on either side. There are little windows which you can open to get grille-free photo's of the Thames. The exhibition started OK when focused on the history of the bridge but once that was done and dusted, the rest of the exhibition focused on other bridges of the world, the City of London bridges etc ... it really felt like they ran out of things to exhibit on the bridge itself. On hindsight, I don't think we would have missed much if we had skipped the tour altogether and just appreciated the bridge from the outside. Our teenage kids and little one were quite bored after the initial wow!"

Though on the day of our visit, the lifts were not operational due to maintenance - meaning that we had to climb hundreds of steps to get to the top of one tower to view the exhibition, and then down hundreds of steps for the other tower to get to the bottom. Engine room exhibition was good - however we were informed that the bridge is no longer run by coal and steam - which the engine room showcased. Rather the bridge is now run by grid-electricity. We found it amazing that the bridge could be opened in 30 secs, and the entire open/close traffic hold and release process will take under 10 mins. Definitely worth a visit!"

There are many benches in the area where you can sit and admire the scenery - and if you're lucky, you can actually see the bridge bascules rising for a boat (which we did once). If you fancy some ice-cream, there's a Ben and Jerry's store that shares its space with a Subway on your right, when you're coming to the shore, across from the Tower of London. We went up the bridge for the exhibition and the walkways and it was slightly interesting. There are facts about the construction on the walkway, but we didn't think the view was that great - the glass around it can be a little smudged. It was actually a bit disappointing. You can also visit the engines. If you're really interested in engineering, it is definitely worth it, for us, it was just OK. We always regret not visiting the bridge at night, when it's all lit up."

With 2 for 1 train tickets the entrance was very reasonable, even so I think it's only around \u00a38 per adult in any case. In this day and age not a rip off for an 'attraction'. The trip is fairly simple - a long climb up (no lifts today), a quick video at the top then onto the bridge for an exhibition about its history, construction and other iconic bridges. Plus the view and the feeling of actually being on this iconic bridge. Then a trip down and then to the engine rooms for a look at some of the mechanics behind it. Very glad we went and all the family enjoyed it (me, wife, 9 year old and stroppy teenager!) I read someone else's review and they said going up was pointless - 'not worth the money, we can study the history of bridges aound the world cheaper at the internet' - that's I guess the same sort of person who complains about the cost of eating out in a restaurant against how cheap it is to eat frozen pizza at home! Well worth going, seeing the exhibition in context at the bridge and the views!"

We started by climbing the staircase inside one of the Towers to the walkway 200 feet above the river and that runs parallel to the road beneath where we saw the first of two videos on the history of Tower Bridge. We were free to take photos throughout the tour and our guide provided both technical explanations of the workings of the Bridge and funny anecdotes and interesting stories about the Bridge and its surroundings throughout our tour which lasted over an hour. We saw everything from panoramic views over London from the walkway to the inner workings of the Victorian lifting mechanisms. It really was a very interesting experience and a unique insight into one of the most recognizable of London\u2019s landmarks."

The lift in the entrance hall was out of order and rather than face 250 steps with an ankle injury, we were redirected to a secret lift on the other side of the road and river - inconvenient to say the least. This meant that starting the tour half way round, we had to walk back across the first upper gallery to the beginning and then retrace our steps before walking the length of the second viewing upper bridge twice again. The explanatory audio visual presentation was Ok but could have been more comprehensive. However, the engine room was truly excellent with clear explanations of how the wonderfully preserved massive steam engines with the aid of some very clever Victorian engineering and hydraulics raised and lowered the bridge."

In addition the two sections of the bridge can be raised to allow the passing small ships in the River Thames makes it something unique worth seeing. I never miss to visit the Bridge when ever I visit London and take some photographs. This is very close to Tower of London Museum and many snack shops and souvenir shops are available nearby. If you go by the under ground train ( circle line), you can get down at TOWER HILL station.

There is a lift that takes you to the 4th floor and you walk into a room where a short film is played about the decision on the bridge being built. After this you then walk across the alleyways above the road and there are a number of photos exhibitions being shown. The views are nice from this level. you then enter the other side of the bridge and you can then watch another short film, before going down the levels and being able to see a bit more of the structure of this bridge. There are toilets and a chance to get the lift down to ground level before walking along the blue line to the engine rooms. The engine rooms a lovely to see how this grand bridge worked. This is all on one level and then takes you out into the shop before exiting the engine rooms. This is not a long visit from my view and took about 40 minutes, which is fine if you are getting to see a number of London's sights. The cost is not expensive and for the time that it takes you get to visit a great London land mark, before moving on to other sights."

Walking across this well known icon of London is an experience in its own right and it is free. What the Rialto Bridge is for Venice, is the Tower Bridge for London. Not to be skipped, especially for the first time visitor. Just feel the history. Further good news is, that you can combine the Tower Bridge walk with a visit of the Tower of London and St. Katharine's Dock at the North side and the Thames South Bank walk on the south side. The view over the Thames from Tower Bridge is stunning with the new Shard skyscraper on the left and a glimpse of St. Paul's on the right. See the pictures."

It was so neat to see the hustle and bustle of the business people, who usually ride the tube, walking across the bridge. It was such a different experience from the time before. As we walked back over that evening, we met the business men and women walking back home. We we always going in the opposite direction against the wave of humanity.Just standing in the middle of the bridge and watching the water traffic was so neat."

You enter through the bottom of one of the towers and into a large lift that takes you to one of the upper levels. From there you watch a little video introduction with some charming talking paintings before heading out on to the horizontal beams where the galleries are. From here you can go back and forth along the beams taking in the views and the history of the tower.My favourite bit was the second tower. Don't forget to look up and see the model workmen on the rafters. You then head down another elevator into the gift shop where you can buy the usual keyrings and memorabilia that is much cheaper outside the tower.It doesn't end there. Afterwards you have to follow the blue line and you get to visit the Engine rooms and the giant steam engines that control the drawer bridges. They are no longer used, but are in excellent condition and make an exciting wander around, if you like that sort of thing."

So many attractions in this area, including the Tower London, Touriing the Belfast, Boat tours up and down the Thames River, and of course, the Tower Bridge itself!!

The lift up was quite slow coming, and was a bit of a crush, but otherwise there was plenty of room to wander over the bridge spans and take in the sights.Across the bridge and into the old engine rooms revealed the original steam engines, which were well presented, but with limited information.Look out for leaflets and people giving out discount leaflets - we got 20% off bringing the cost down to \u00a36 per person"

Swap \u00a32.50 of CC points for a \u00a310 Days Out voucher and when you get to the Bridge they will exchange it for a combined ticket so that you can visit the nearby Monument of London as well (and climb 311 steps to the top and the viewing platform). So you actually get to tick off doing two exciting things for \u00a32.50 of points. The exhibitions are simple but informative, the engine room impressive. I went just so that I could say that I have been. They even give you a \u00a32 off voucher for the gift shop - which is one of the best, and not overpriced, gift shops that I have been to."

A lift took my group of tourists up one of the towers to the top of the tower, adjacent to the walkway-span.Once out of the lift, we walked into a room where we watched an interesting film about the bridge design and how that particular design was selected. After watching the film, we walked out onto the walkway between the two towers, to walk across the bridge to the opposite tower. The walkway is fully enclosed with a solid floor. The view is fantastic both up and down the river. This exhibition is self paced which was great if you wish to take lots of photos or to just admire the view. When we crossed to the second tower and as we walked from the walkway, we each had our photo taken with the Tower Bridge in the background. We were given a ticket to pick up our photos later if we wanted to them - cost \u00a315. We then moved into a room and watched another short film on the building of the bridge, before walking out to the second walkway to take us back in the opposite direction. Again I took lots of photos down the river. Big Ben, Westminster and St Paul\u2019s could all be seen in the distance, as well an excellent view of the glass sky-scraper called \"The Shard\" and the oval shaped building known as the \"Gherkin\". We then took the lift down to the bottom and were shown through the original \u201cEngine Room\", which still houses the old machinery. Originally the spans were lifted by steam operated hydraulics. In this room, there were big hydraulics and all sorts of mechanical stuff. It was very interesting. We then watched another short film on how these engines worked. Today, the bridge spans are lifted by electric powered hydraulics \u2013 approx. 3 times a day. I found the entire exhibition totally fascinating and I loved it."

It is really astounding to be able to get inside this tribute to Victorian engineering but do try to visit on a day with when there is good visibility. The external views both up and down the Thames are excellent and are worth going in themselves. They are probably more spectacular and certainly more panoramic than others on offer.Watch the introductory presentation. The characterisations of the main players, including Queen Victoria, are a bit tacky but it gives a very good history of why and how the bridge was built including the more outlandish proposals for providing a Thames crossing.Having lead you along the walkway the tour then takes you to the engine room where there are the original machines that lifted the bridge and for the technically minded an explanation of how the whole thing worked."

We thought it would give us a very nice view of London - however, the \"exhibits\" were uninteresting, and our view of London was limited and not 360 as I had expected. The experience appeared to be more geared towards school groups, as evidenced by the two extremely loud groups that were there at the same time as us."

However before that you view an informative short film, as to how it was constructed, by whom & why...(people have said its boring, but being a City of London guide,i didn't think so!!)..there is also lots of information on both Walkways, concerning other bridges (worldwide)..the City of London & other buildings you can see on the London skyline!...i really enjoyed my visit, especially the views & also visiting the Victorian 'Engine rooms' on the south section - follow the blue line lolGhosh i wish i'd done this years ago....lol!!!

We dent during the day and there was no queue or anything which is a big bonus when visiting London. When you enter you will be screened by X-ray, frisking & metal detectors however this is standard when visiting large important infrastructure. You will go up with a lift conductor in a small group, when you arrive at the top you will watch a film about the bridge (a little boring when you know it already). After being freed from the film you are able to walk along the top of the bridge on both side. The sight is amazing, you can see all the way across London which is great for photos and a different experience. The fact that you are above the river also allows you to see famous ships and buildings which you would not otherwise see. you can walk across both sides of the tower for up to 1 hour so you have lots of time to enjoy the sights.When you come back down you exit through a small gift shop and out a small fire exit which takes you down to the river."

Among several visits to London i visited the Tower bridge last year in October. It was a gloomy dayand after just picturing it for some time from a distance i decided to take a tour of the bridge to see it from Inside. The entrance is from the North Tower and you start by seeing how the Bridge was designed. after this you can walk the walkway across the bridge where you will have the opportunity to see the River and City from high above the Bridge. As you cross the walkway you will reach South Tower where you can see you the Bridge was built. The tour doesn't end there. There is a Blue Line marked and you can follow the same to see the Engine Rooms. This is where all the Historical engines and machinery is, which used to operate the opening and closing the bridge. I liked this part the most as you get first hand views of some of the best engineering feats of British history."

Following which you pass two hallways crossing all the bridge showing an exhibition about the history of the bridge and bridges around the globe.Finally you also get to visit the engine rooms which is very interesting showing the way the bridge operates mechanically. I really appreciated the way children are greeted with a passport and set or stickers are collected in every stage of the visit.TIP: Take note of the time(s) when the bridge is planned to open and its spectacular to assist at this.

This was a great experience - not just for the views but the informative film and exhibition about the creation of the unique bridge - complemented with a fascinating history of other notable bridges from around the world - and the engine room. A great reminder of the vision and skill of Victorian engineers and architects. Superb value too - only \u00a38 entry (and you can get a 20% off voucher on the web), or \u00a39 with entry to the Monument as well. Seeing the bridge lift at close hand is wonderful too - so serene! The bridge lift timetable is on the Tower Bridge website. Enjoy!"

Although living in the UK for some time they had not gone to the exhibition before, so it was new to us all. It gave us the opportunity to take a lot of photos over the city of London. They provide for children as they had a little sticker book getting more stickers at different points through the exhibition, which kept them interested. A lot of information is provided, in a very interesting way, as to the concept and building of the bridge, including some plans that never made it off the drawing board - probably a good thing. It also includes visiting the engine room to see how the bridge goes up and down - particularly interesting to my husband and son. Would recommend it."

Even walked over it, and taken a boat under it.But this was the first time that I experienced it so closely and intimately.From the Ticket Office, you get wisked up to the top of Tower Bridge in an elevator ensconsed in the tower closest to the Tower of London, where you enter a large \"auditorium\" at the top of Tower Bridge. Here you pause to watch a very short, entertaining video clip depicting Queen Victoria discussing the need to construct Tower Bridge with the architect and engineer responsible.The you walk along glass-encased walkways from the one tower to the other, enjoying magnificent views of London, and some very informative boards, including a photographic exhibition on some of the great bridges of the world, some trivia about London Bridge, as well as alternative designs for thr bridge, which were considered before settling on the iconic lifting bridge that still stands today. You can spend as much time as you want here, before you visit a second auditorium in the tower closest to the \"Armadillo\" on the South Bank.In the second auditorium, a short video presentation on the construction of Tower Bridge allows youto marvel att he inginuity of those in charge of this project while looking at the sheer majesty of the steel frame, stairs, etc. which is hidden from the outside world behind the stone finishing.You leave the bridge itself by elevator in the South tower and then make your way to the engine room where the large hydraulic engines which lift the bridge are housed. Another magnificent testimony to the ingenuity of the engineers and designers of the time!This is most definitely worth a visit!"

The history of Tower bridge is that it took years of discussion and after an open public design competition, it took 8 years of construction to make Tower Bridge a reality. Over 50 designs were submitted and the design of Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect was approved. Construction started in 1986 and the bridge was officially opened on 30th June 1894 by the Prince of Wales and his wife. It is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London, England, over the River Thames. It is close to the Tower of London, from whitch it took its name. It has become an iconic symble of London. The total cost of construction was \u00a31,184,000 which comes to (\u00a3100 million as of 2012)."

Get right up to huge machinery, watch videos on the history of the bridge, how it was built, both towers have something worth viewing. Then go up one of the towers and do some sightseeing of London, from within an enclosed area. After that, take in the intricate work that was done on the outside of the bridge.

I was stunned, for example, to learn that this Victorian curio still, to this day, continues to operate as a serviceable bridge, 24 hours a day, continuing to allow Londoners safe passage from one side of the river to t'other. Whether they be on bus, in car, on tractor, on go-kart, by foot or by wheelchair. Amazing and astounding both in equal measure. Towering over the mighty River Thames, flowing steadily from one side of the bridge to t'other. Who knows which came first, the river or the bridge ? One of life's eternal mysteries, but, there again, who cares ? This still makes for a glorious and worthwhile exhibition, that I would urge visitors both near and far to pay attention to. Keep up the fantastic work, gang !!!!"

We were planning a visit to the tower bridge exhibition between touring the Tower of London & our evening booking at the view from the shard, basically because we had to cross the bridge to get to where we wanted to go so why not do the tour as well ?But it was much more than just a diversion or a way to fill some time.We used 2 for 1 vouchers to gain entry so saved a few quid as well which is always a bonus.Before we entered we were lucky enough to see the bridge opening twice, once from the riverboat on the way to tower pier & again as we were headed to the exhibition itself, which was a real treat as we were right at the front of the barriers and had a ringside seat to see how effortlessly & quickly the bridge opens.You can tour here at your own choice of pace and its all interesting from the short video presentations to the walkways to the engine rooms at the end of the tour.Some people say the views aren't good from the walkways and you don't get a totally clear view from them but you can see all the sights and I'd say its worth visiting the exhibition, it's reasonably priced and doesn't take too much time from your day.We enjoyed our time here viewing a real London icon !"

A hidden gem in Londons tourist trade is the Tower bridge exhibition and it didn't cost a fortune-especially if you are able to use the 2-1 offer from TFL. To start you travel, by lift up the north tower, where you can watch a short film about the bridge, My 11 year old son loved that as well as the main screen, what at first look like paintings was actually screens as well, so they interacted with the character in the main film. You then walk along the East walkway and enjoy the amazin views! Their was also an exhibition of bridges around the world here. In the west tower, as well as the amzing views there was an art exhibition.You then descend the south tower, down the grand staircases, and make your way back along the bridge (follow the blue line on the ground) to the engine rooms and gift shop.The whole tour took about 90 minutes and the time flew by.In the words of my 11yo-it was amazing, can we go again?"

Where the London Assembly Building is, that used to be Simon's Wharf where my dad was a docker. As a kid I crossed this bridge many times to play on the bomb ruins that is now the city.There are great views from this bridge, especially of the Tower and Traitors Gate. I even played on the little beach under the Tower and swam in the Thames. As children we would always go to the centre of the bridge and stand on the Join or crack as we called it. If you stand on the join with both feet on 2 parts of the bridge and close your eyes you will feel the bridge move as traffic passes over the join. It is a very strange feeling, you may see other people doing it.The bridge is a classic example of Victorian engineering made of Cast Iron and clad in stone. It was originally worked by water pressure from a pumping station about a mile away in the East End. I have great memories of being on the set and meeting John Wayne on the bridge when he was filming \"Brannigan\". A fantastic bridge in a great city."

This bridge should not be confused with London Bridge, which is the next bridge over from Tower Bridge. As my wife and I strolled along the banks of the modernly developed Southwark area, we were taken back by the sights and sounds of London. As we walked along the path, we were amazed at how London kept its historically majestic feel while at the same time embraced modern development. We counted a number of construction cranes looming over the city, which is a sure sign of growth and development. Coming upon the Tower Bridge was an awe \u2013 inspiring experience, especially since we arrived there just as the sun was setting and the nightlights of London were illuminating the picturesque city. A stroll along the Southwark bank of the River Thames, crossing the Tower Bridge around sunset should be on everyone\u2019s London itinerary."

The entrance is not fantastic but it is under a bridge, we had to wait awhile for a group to build before the tour could begin, we were lead by I believe an East European lady who made no effort to at least sound like a Londoner, we arrived in a long room with a few exhibits and a model of the bridge in times gone bye. We seemed to spend an age in this room just waiting which was made harder by a couple of young Australian kids whose parents seem to have forgotten to teach them any social boundaries and later in the tour their behaviour was to some extent ruining the experience. After the victorian pub (wait and see) this family were separated away from the group, this showed the staff in a very good light. The lady who operated the lift (is it a lift you decide) was believable but why were we squeezed into a long narrow room sitting on a bench in front of a TV that didn't show anything worth seeing and left waiting for a few minutes, I guess it was for another group to cross our route. My wife screamed several times as well as a group of 4 young ladies from the US during the remainder of the tour which was very entertaining, the revolving drum messed me up for a bit but I'm not good on roundabouts anyway. A special mention to the slightly camp chap who explained the execution method used in England's passed who was brilliant and dealt with the 2 unruly kids remarkably well, also the young man who did the young English wide boy of old, he started rather slowly but he grew on you as he told his story. To the both of you, you made the experience. And very abruptly it was over and besides a few vending machines your back under the bridge.Nearly forgot if you are travelling into London by train don't forget there is a 2for1 offer available online, search 2for1 London days out!"

It is very close (as you would expect) to the Tower of London, so it's a good option to pursue after your ToL visit.You get access to the top walkway that traverses the bridge and the exhibition inside that explains the construction and Victorian history. The walkway itself may also have special exhibitions to see..The view from the top walkway is stunning and you have great vistas looking both east and west down the Thames (I have included one of my photos with this review.)The Exhibition entry fee also gives you access to the Machine Room which controls and powers the bridge movement mechanism. Fascinating for the mechanically-minded but less so for other visitors. (I've also included a photo of this too.)In summary, if we'd had to pay for entry (instead of using our London Pass) I suspect my wife and I may well have questioned the expense."

It\u2019s not worth the money to get in.You can learn a lot about the history of London and know about other interesting big bridges around the world. However, the view from the top of the tower is very limited, due to the iron crossed of the bridge. It\u2019s more informative than a panoramic view. If you don\u2019t have much time, don\u2019t worry about it. Your time will be better spent around the Thames and its bankside where you can have a view OF the bridge and not FROM the bridge."

During this visit we were so fortunate to see 3.One was early morning to allow a tall-masted ship through. The speed with which the lift occurs is amazing, a tribute to the hidden engineering involved. It literally takes only a few short minutes for the whole event to begin and end. Probably just as well, given how busy the bridge is with both pedestrians and vehicles.The most dramatic occasion was during a beautiful sunset, as the whole bridge was beginning to light up. A wonderful sight."

You pass through several permanent exhibits about the history of the bridge, as well as changing exhibits on the theme of London, bridges etc, all with a fantastic view along the Thames. Don't forget to follow the trail from the second tower to the former engine rooms that used to control the opening and closing of the bridge as these are as interesting as the bridge itself.

We all enjoyed the trip up the elevator, across the bridge, watching the film of how the bridge was built, back across the other bridge and down the stairs. My boys espcially enjoyed the interactive elements back down on ground level just prior to exiting. They have an appreciation of Tower Bridge that they didn't have before. Unfortunatley the bridge wasn't schedule to raise that day but I think standing on the bridge and watching it raise up afterwards would have been the icing on the cake for them, so try and plan your visit around that if you can"

On the other side another short movie how the bridge is built and how it works. It is one of the first steam powered bridges ever built, so for an engineer this is very cool. Then you go down to the old engine room with the steam engines and of course a souvenir shop. This tour was way better than expected."

A short video, a look at the equipment once used to operate the bridge, and an elevator ride to the walkway. Some information about the construction and operation of the bridge is presented, but we enjoyed the walk across more than the rest. Great skyline views of London and the Thames. Not really certain if you can walk the bridge without the museum.... but it seems like you could ? ? We were there in March and there was no line and no waiting. Based on the set up off the place, it seems that lines could be long and a lot of waiting involved. In that situation, I'd give the Tower Bridge Experience a pass.

While interesting, if you are someone who wants to see it's current inner workings you will be disappointed.That being said you do get a glimpse of how it was designed (enough information for the layman, but not for someone who actually understands structures). The top part of the bridge ddoes offer nice views. Is it worth the price? I think it depends on how much interest you have about bridges.

Not bad really. Got the lift/elevator up to the platforms. Watched a short film about the history of the bridge. Onto the platforms to view London in all it's cloudy and snowy glory. We could have seen further on a clearer day. It was ok. Enjoyed photos of other notable bridges from across the world. That was very interesting. The views are ok. Nothing amazing.On to the other side next for a view of the other side of London. A much better view on this side (tower of London, the big wheel, the shard, st paul's, etc)Down the stairs and next stop was the engine rooms. For this, you have to leave the attraction and walk to the other end of the bridge before going down some stairs and finding the bit that says 'engine rooms'. Personally, I found this part rather boring. Just walked through it as it was about as interesting as staring into the Thames murky waters for a day or so.No way did we exit through the gift shop! Ha! A pretty good gift shop in ones opinion. Bought a few gifts, some for us and a couple for some American friends who are visiting.Not a long experience at all this one so if the queues/lines are ok, you should be able to fit this in. Not spectacular and not a must see......BUT..........Tower Bridge is iconic and now I know what it looks like inside of just thinking what it looks like and that was the selling point for me."

I'd recommend going at a time when the bridge is being raised - though make sure you are outside the bridge for that, as the view is interesting but limited from inside the bridge. Or try to see it from both angles! Check their website for Bridge lifting times as it doesn't happen daily."

One of the most iconic bridges and attractions in the world, and what is there? \u00a36 lets you go across the high walkway, see two projected videos, and have a look in the engine room. None of these things we found at all inspiring, especially the half hearted attempts at interactivity. Maybe it's our age, and we expect everything to be interactive, in your face, or 'touch screen'. Personally I wouldn't waste my time paying to go in - just having a look from the outside, and a walk down the road would suffice. If you are interested in engineering however, I do feel that this place would have more appeal - but mass commercial appeal for one of London's leading sights? I think not."

Firstly, I had discovered that two of of my greatuncles, William Temple of Barton, and Robert Temple of Wells Next the Sea, N. Norfolk,who were both Master Mariners had brought their ships to the Port of London for thedelivery of Norfolk produce in the mid - nineteenth century. Secondly, only minutesaway is the Tower Bridge Merchant Navy Memorial for those who died at sea duringWWI. I had travelled first class from Northampton - Euston Station, and taken a bus to TowerBridge, Tuesday, March 26th. My father - in - law, Capt. Owen E. Freemantle had his shipthe 'Marie Elsie' torpedoed by U-28, 10. vi. 1917. Three of his crew were lost at seaas the ship went down. Their names are recorded on the Memorial and I laid a wreath intheior memory having taken a great deal of research to find their names, and the circumstances of the attack by the German U-boat 28. In nearby Trinity House is a registerwhich records all the names of those who died at sea in WWI. The Memorial can be reachedalso by the London Underground. I had chosen the bus rather than an expensive taxi.Sadly, the Memorial garden is also home to London's homeless, who use the area forsleeping off their problems. I can only trust that my wreath is not damaged in any way.Of course, the local ambience is greatly different to the early Edwardian era, and thatof mid - Victorian England when my relatives brought their ships from Norfolk to delivertheir cargoes. One of the crew members of my Great Uncle, was a German, mid - 1850sI will return in better weather.Geoff Hamilton, editor, Anglo-Nordic-Times Intl. / LOOK NORDICTues. 26. iii. 2013,"

We had rented a flat in Chiswick and we travel everyday to central London through the TUBE for the atractions. Despite been freezing weather a couple of days in the city (which is almost always cold) we had a great time. Weather didn't stop us from enjoying lots of attractions that are available to tourism. Of couse we HAD to see the very famous Tower Bridge, Tower of London, London Bridge, Monument, etc, etc. We learned that first you have to take a bus ride (Bus Tour) that will take you almost all over the city and then you can decide were to go and re-visit. Beautiful architecture and history. Beware of time. We didn't feel business schedule is \"tourist friendly\" but still we enjoyed everything. London is a great city to visit and I would recomend it to anybody who has the chance. If you are planning to be there for a week or so check The London Pass which will give you access to many atracctions but you need to plan it very carefully to the minute to take full advantage of it. Public transport is excellent and no need to rent a car...unless you are going to the country side. Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did."

The vicinity to the river, St Katherine's Dock on the other side, the fact that it is also a residence place make it very neibourghood like and beautiful at the same time.

This summer the Olympic Rings were a beautiful accessory. The view down the Thames and over the Tower of London are priceless. And talking about price, Best offer in town is the London Pass. You can get it for 1,2,3 or 6 days and it provides entry into 60 attractions, including Thames River Cruise, Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, London Bridge Experience!, Windsor Castle, St Paul's Cathedral, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, Tower Bridge Exhibition, Hampton Court Palace, Churchill War Rooms - all the most popular in London (and just outside London). Plus it gives you fast tract entry into most attractions - especially important during summer. A 6 day pass is \u00a3102 for adults, add \u00a354 (\u00a377/99 for kids) for a six day travel card. This give you huge savings and the fast track is worth every penny. I'm not a London Pass salesman on commission, it's just that we always get a lot of visitors and this is what I always suggest to them. Just goggle London Pass."

We then went down to the engine rooms and were pleased to see that they had restored all the engines in working order and placed lots of information around to read. The usual gift shop at the end with all sorts of bits and pieces. All in all a really good attraction to see."

The New London Bridge replaced the original London Bridge in the late 1960's when an American millionaire bought it and had it taken down brick by brick, and rebuilt in Arizona. The thing is the American thought he was buying Tower Bridge, ( the one you can see from London Bridge)."

I've always wanted to visit the iconic Tower Bridge having seen it back when I was about 12 during a visit to see HMS Belfast - I probably looked at the bridge back then and didn't appreciate it's magnificence so a visit was top of my list during my trip to London a fortnight ago.The view from the top is brilliant, the city of London, Canary Wharf in the distance, St. Paul's, the Shard, City Hall and of course the Tower of London. It was a cold but clear day and the view was excellent.From the animated introduction about the conception and construction of the bridge to the signposts and information boards, a visit to Tower Bridge tells you as much about the history of London (both social and engineering) as the history of the bridge itself.It's one of the more reasonably priced attractions in London and worth it for the view from the top alone."

You are taken to the top by lift and then move along the East side walkway, with views out the seaward side of the Thames. The main attraction of this side, is a series of articles about the major bridges of the World. On reaching the South Tower, you then move along the West Walkway. This offers some superb views of London, with the Tower and HMS Belfast the most prominent. After a return to the South Tower, the visit then takes in the most interesting part. You have to leave the Bridge and head about 400 metres down the road to the site of the main workings of the Bridge. This shows all the machinery and hydraulic systems of the bridge (as was). It shows the ingenuity and Victorian engineering at its best.Overall a most enjoyable and fascinating visit and well worth it."

Although the bridge has a lovely view of the river it is difficult to take clear pictures through the dirty windows. There is a washroom inside,some technical videos and historic photos. If you study engineering and like this sort of thing, you may really like this attraction. I did not. I enjoyed walking on the regular part of the bridge and buying warm nuts from the street vendors. Unless you have a London Pass and nothing better to do, save your money and take some nice pictures in front of the bridge."

Every day I am lucky enough to view this iconic steel bridge(it is clad with stone) from my office window and recently paid \u00a330 to join an Engineering Tour (that takes place at weekends between January and March) and marvel at the ingenuity of our Victorian forefathers in both designing and building this architectural and engineering masterpiece.Tower Bridge was the delivery of another much needed bridge across the Thames for those on foot or in vehicles whilst also maintaining a river channel for ships of up to a 10,000 tonnage and/or 140 foot height above the river waterline, to transport goods between the coast and the Pool of London at a time when all imports and exports was by sea.Our tour guide begun by telling us of the original winning bridge design by the City of London's Architect Sir Herbert Jones (who also built Billingsgate, Smithfield and Leadenhall Markets) and who was to die in 1887 only one year after construction had begun; the engineer John Wolfe Barry who was able to put Jones' design into practice; Sir William Armstrong whose firm built the amazing bascule lifting machinery and George Stevenson who was able to take the project to completion after 8 years in 1894 when Tower Bridge was opened by Queen Victoria's son, the Prince of Wales, the future Edward V11.The 2 hour tour continued on the two high level pedestrian walkways which cross between the two bridge towers. After being closed in 1910 they were only reopened for visitors in 1982. Originally built for travellers to continue their journey across the river whilst Tower Bridge itself was open, they soon fell into disuse as a result of the bridge opening taking only one minute to achieve its maximum 86 degree opening span. The walkways had also been misused in early years by suicide jumpers, although the walkways are now enclosed.We then visited one of the two bridge pilots cabins and below that a machinery room where the original hydraulic system transferred the power that had been stored in six giant accumulators via a system of pumps and gears, into the lift of the two bascules that carried the roadway, allowing boat access to the riverside wharves near London Bridge. . The 1200 ton bascules work on a see saw basis(hence their name from the french) and pivot in each bridge tower when raised to fill the cavernous space of the piers below which viewing was the highlight of the tour for me. Finally, we visited the southside boiler rooms where 20 tons of coal had been burnt each week to generate the steam power necessary to perform over 150 bascule lifts a week which were required during the time the Port of London prospered before containerisation. Nowadays the bridge only opens a handful of times each week and only after 24 hours notice.So go and enjoy this magnificient Victorian edifice constructed by 432 workers (10 of whom died during the work) and celebrate the wonderful achievement of Britons in days past when this country built an empire and led the world."

I have to admit that I was in for a surprise on the way there when I got to the Tower Bridge. As an Americican I always heard stories about London Bridge and as a history lover I was excited to see the Tower of London. Neither was as impressive to me as walking over the historical River Thames and getting my first real look at the Tower Bridge. By coming up close to it by bus, I didn't get to really see the bridge until we arrived at the Tower, so from the vantage point of the Tower of London, I spent my time there just staring at the Tower Bridge.It is an architectural marvel and functional masterpiece! It carries auto traffic and foot traffic accross the bridge and thousands of people a day!On the end of our week there, we got to take a river cruise where we partied and visited with some very nice people, on a chilly night, and the lights from the Tower Bridge told me where I was and the sights around me even the dark of the London Night."

I especially appreciated the touch monitor that allowed you to press the picture of the view to determine what the different buildings were that you were seeing. There was a movie of what the bridge construction would have looked like that was quite interesting. After making your way back the other elevated footbridge, it was just a short walk to the underground workings of the bridge. That part of the tour was the most interesting for my husband who is of a technical mindset. If you're bringing the kids along, be sure to get a kid pack for each. They give you a small cartoon picture of the bridge and at each stop during the tour the child receives stickers to put on it. The Tower Bridge tour was well worth the price of admission."

Opened in 1894, it stands proud across the Thames near the Tower of London and the Town Hall.The attraction starts off in the north-west tower, where you take the lift up to the walkway level. Here, a short film is shown depicting the history of the bridge. After the film, you head out onto the east walkway, where you have a nice view towards the east (including views of the City of London and Canary Wharf). The walkway also houses an exhibition with further details around the construction of the bridge, life of the river and also a photo exhibition with the theme \"Bridges of the World\". Beautiful views and intersting exhibits. Once you reach the south tower, there is an amination describing the process of building the bridge. The next part of the visit is to head out onto the west walkway, which has nice views over the Tower of London, City Hall and Westminster (i.e. the West End and central parts of the city). The west walkway also has an exhibit with an Olympic theme. The visit then continues downstairs, with a short walk into the old Victorian engine rooms. This part of the exhibition displays the old Victorian steam engines and machinery that used to operate the bridge. The machinery is very well preserved and well presented, making it an intersting part of the tour.The tour ends up, predictably, in the gift shop where you can buy all sorts of London-associated souvenirs.All in all, a good way to spend an hour or two (not an all-day activity)."

A truly magnificent structure, not just any old bridge, this is the grade II listed 'Tower Bridge' often mistakenly called London Bridge by overseas visitors. Tower Bridge is one of London's most iconic views. London Bridge shouldn't be forgotten by visitors however as whilst it may not be pretty to look at it is situated just upstream of Tower Bridge and offers the most wonderful vantage point from where you can capture those memorable views of this beautiful bridge spanning the width of the River Thames especially as the sum is setting - amazing. Tower Bridge was built between 1886 and 1894 in a Victorian Gothic style which I think compliments the nearby Tower of London. Tower Bridge lifts to allow tall ships to pass underneath - it an amazing site if you are lucky enough to be there when it happens especially if it is one of the tall masted historic sailing ships as it is like going back in time. The bridge itself played a key role in celebrating the Queens 2012 Golden Jubilee this summer when the bridge was lifted fully open as a fitting salute to the Queen as she passed on her Jubilee Barge. It was also featured in the opening ceremony of the London 2012 summer Olympic Games. So be sure to make some time to go and see this dramatic bridge, walk across it, admire its majestic towers and if you have time visit the museum which tells the history of this famous bridge. I hope you liked reading my review - I am lucky as I get to see it everyday on my way to and from work and never get bored looking at its timeless beauty. Enjoy."

The other covered the Olymoic Games from around the world. Rather a hammily acted film on the construction of the Bridge that we were forced to watch before being allowed through to the walkways.I actually preferred looking at Tower Bridge from the outside, as you can see it in all its magnificent splendour. It's quite awe inspiring when you see it lifting to allow boats to pass under."

They have done it very cleverly - as there are two walkways, the inner side of each is given over to a splendid photographic exhibition, while the outer side gives clear views over London, one side facing east, the other west. There is also another fascinating video between the two walkways.The last part - the engine rooms and bridge mechanism were much more interesting than might appear.

If you go during the week it is full of busy restaurants both quick serve and some of the normal high end brand like Gaucho. Again the view and photo ops are amazing from here.Walking to the bridge and walking over the bridge is fun as well, but immeadietly you will be looking for a pub/ restaurant to... do something. That is why I recomend skipping the walk accross and just enjoy it from More London."

However, the exhibition, while good, is not on my must-do list. The whole thing takes about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on how carefully you read all the signs. The exhibition begins with a short film about the building of the bridge. Then you walk across it two times, on the east side and the west, where there is a display about all the famous bridges of the world. There is another short film and then you come to an engineering room at the end. It costs 8 pounds admission."

You must pass through a security check to venture into the inner sanctum of the bridge, but given the state of things in the world, it is a small price to pay to protect such an iconic landmark.

This rating is for the \"experience\", paid admission to the upper deck and engine room of the bridge. In fact, the most inspiring part of the visit was seeing the displays of other historically significant bridges in the world. But as other reviewers have mentioned, this is basically a poster gallery.Price was not unfair. Top level bridge walkway was enclosed with only a few very small windows open-air for picture taking. I found that disappointing because I enjoy heights especially open-air.When I return to London, I'll just walk across again and take pictures from sidewalk. I don't believe I gained any better vantage point from the exhibition or upper deck."

However, before we were able to complete the walkways part of the tour, we were invaded by... wait for it... Jedward!Jedward complete with entourage and TV crew, started to set up TV recording equipment accross about one third of one of the walkways, and telling the paying public to keep out of the way, thus preventing us from completeing the walkways part of the tour. The punters, consisting of mainly foreigners and \"mature\" persons were not impressed...There was no warning or apology about this. They might have at least given us a free gift (Tower Bridge that is, not Jedward!).We were then forced to move down to the engine rooms part of the tour which was very good.Highly reccomended."

We drove on Tower Bridge on the topless hop on hop off bus we were on top deck and what a view we had,if you visit london id advise you go see Tower Bridge its a splendid structure and just the experience of being in London makes it all the more special, and before you drive under the fab arches you are touring opposite what fab pictures you can take. Make sure you take your camera for plenty of snaps."

            "review": "Worth seeing if you are in the area and have a London Pass. The Tower Bridge Exhibition offers insight into an iconic Victorian bridge. It really is quite a marvel with a fascinating history. You start by viewing an animated video about why the bridge was needed and how it was constructed. It was quite a feat for its time. You also get to go up on the walkways which offer some grand views of London. On the East Walkway there is a photo exhibit featuring information on the great bridges of the world. Nice to see Brooklyn Bridge so well represented! The exhibition also features some of the original equipment which powered the Bridge long ago. . I probably would not have gone to this exhibition if it were not for us having London Passes, which would have been our loss. While there's not that much to see, per se, it's still nice to visit, I think. That\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re at the Tower of London, as it is right next door. As this was a BD trip to London for my mom, she really wanted to see this beautiful bridge. So for that alone, it was worth going. So, go take a look. You don\u2019t need a lot of time, maybe 45 min\u2019s to an hour, tops, but it\u2019s pretty much worth it.Hope this helps!"

One of these has to be the Tower Bridge which is so different to anything else in the world it stands out so well. I have seen it from a distance during a previous visit but never had chance to get up close. With further research we found that it is possible to go along the walkways above the roadway getting a magnificent view of the river and being given a history of the bridge design.We took advantage of this using the London Pass which enabled free access and it was such an invaluable experience. I wasn't aware of the manner that the bridge was selected from others during a competition to find a suitable design. We saw all of this explained in a wonderful manner but the icing on the cake for me was a visit to the original Victorian engine rooms designed to lift the bridge. Having been trained as an engineer I appreciate this aspect and to be able to see the beautifully designed mechanicics so much more attractive than modern hardware. I strongly recommend this complete trip. Many people don't realise it can be done and it's a worthwhile experience. Especially so if you have a London Pass."

            "review": "The Exhibition is Boring. Visited the Tower Bridge exhibition as part of a honeymoon trip to London in early September 2012 with my new husband.As a piece of architecture the bridge is lovely to look at. It's an iconic part of London and to actually see it up close and to cross it is a must see. It's also fun watching the bridge lifting up to allow big boats through (and it was nice to see the paralympic rings which were still in place when we went as we didn't get a chance to see the full Olympic ones).However, the exhibition inside is simply not worth it. It usually costs \u00a38 each to get into which is astronomically overpriced considering how little you actually get to see in the exhibition (more on this in a moment). We visited because we were in the area and had The London Pass and wanted to utilise it as much as possible. I'm not sure we would've bothered otherwise!Upon entering Tower Bridge you have to go through ridiculous airport style security checks and scans and wait in line for the elevator that takes you 42 metres above the Themes. The elevators are packed like sardine tins so if you're claustrophobic I doubt this attraction will appeal to you. Also while waiting for the elevator at the bottom there's one of those 'have your photograph taken in front of a green screen and buy expensive products at the end with the tower superimposed in the background' thingies. There's no room for this at all in the Tower. Space is limited as it is and to cram a photo area into the middle of the queue for the lifts is ludicrous.Anyway, once out of the lift at the top you watch a really hammy video about the design and planning process of the Tower which really doesn't tell you a great deal and the acting is so awful it puts you off the content anyway. This part of the tour seems compulsory, possibly to make sure there's enough space for new groups on the walkways. Fair enough I suppose, I know I wouldn't have enjoyed an overly packed journey out there but they could've at least made the video better. It's like one of those awful things you're made to sit through at secondary school.The walkways themselves are okay, the views spectacular although the views from one walkway is better than the other (on one side you have the spectacular St Paul's Cathedral, The Tower of London and HMS Belfast etc and on the other you get the unspectacular old docks, people's houses and the boring Canary Wharf complex etc) but the windows are a little dirty and some of the views are thus obscured by filth.There are two exhibitions. The one in the West Walkway is about cities of the Olympic Games (really just a series of photographs) and the one in the East Walkway features an exhibition on great bridges of the world (which is, again, a series of photographs). Really these have no bearing on Tower Bridge at all and are boring. They add nothing to the experience and once you've looked at a few of the photographs it all gets a bit monotonous. I suppose your main focus isn't supposed to be on these though but on the views outside the windows (and if that's the case then why aren't they clean!) but it still doesn't justify the \u00a38 per person admission cost.There's a few other bits and pieces to view once you get off the walkways such as a video showing the construction of the bridge (I liked this and thought it should've been done earlier in the tour) and a few random metal plaques with neon lights as you go down the stairs towards the exit.Didn't visit the engine rooms as we were pressed for time but I'm sure they would've been more interesting than the Tower itself. Mercifully the whole thing didn't last long but I won't visit again as it was a huge disappointment."

            "review": "Meh.... I visited London recently on business and took a few extra days to do some exploring around London. At the top of my list of course was the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge. Overall, London is VERY easy to get around via both the bus and metro. Although you will see much more of London if you take the bus, traffic can also be very congested, so for me my preference was to take the Metro. Public transportation in and around London is safe, efficient, easy and cheap.Having said all that. Tower bridge and the Tower of London are within walking distance of one another, so if you plan on seeing one you might as well see both. You should give yourself about 2-3 hours to see the Tower of London, and maybe a 1/2 hour to see Tower Bridge.My personal opinion is that Tower Bridge is absolutely beautiful. From the outside, and most especially at night when it is all lit up, it is well worth seeing. As for taking a tour on the inside, I thought it was just ok. The windows are very cloudy and it's rather difficult to get a good view of London without feeling as though that view is rather obstructed. Inside there are photos and background information on other famous bridges throughout the world. Not that it wasn't interesting-ish, but I don't think there was really enough to make this walkthrough worth the money. I had the London Pass, so it was covered so I didn't have to pay an entrance fee, but if I had, I think I would have considered it an even bigger dissapointment. So having said all that, if you have the London Pass and your at the Tower of London, give it a go. If you have to pay for it outright, it might just be nice to view it from below because it really is quite exceptional to see.As for the London Pass which I referenced earlier, depending on the amount of time you have in London, it might not be a bad idea to get the London Pass. If you are staying 3-5 days, the pass becomes much more economical and essentially grants you 'free' pass to almost all attractions in London. Place your order for the London pass before you go and you will be able to either pick it up right there in central London or possibly have it mailed to you. It saved me quite a bit of money on the trip. You can find it quite easily with a google search. Also, buy a day or week pass to the metro - it covers both buses and the underground, and is fairly inexpensive. I was able to take the metro from the airport to the hotel. Cost me about 8 euro (for a day pass). The business associate I met up with at the hotel got a taxi from the airport. He spent 65 euro and it took him roughly the same amount of time to get to the hotel as it took me. Just some food for thought. They have an excellent (and safe) public transportation system."

The children wanted to go in and we were pleasantly surprised by the fact the cost wasn't extortionate. (\u00a318 for 2 adults and 2 children with 2 under 5's free) Initially you are offered a picture you can purchase later on. We didnt bother with this as we had our own camera with us. You go up in a lift to the top of one of the towers where you are shown a short and interesting film about how the bridge came to be. The children were given quizzes to do which they found quite exciting, and there were at least 2 interactive games for them to play, manned by tower staff. The walk across the very top meant a stunning view, and some of the literature on bridges was actually quite interesting. The other side currently has an olympic display which in all honesty we didnt find that great, but the second short film was again quite interesting. We had the pushchair with us and were able to use lifts to all areas. It was then a short walk back across the bridge and down to the engine rooms. (Note: the lift is signposted with a little blue sign but is not at the end of the blue walkway you are asked to follow, instead being two thirds of the way along) The engine rooms were very impressive... and for families with young children its worth noting the WC's are just by reception! And the children also liked the giant boilers. There were more games for the kiddies to play whilst we watched a film on how the lit the towers. Finally the gift shop gave away free choccy medals for the completed (or semi completed) kids quizzes and we were able to purchase a few souvenirs at not too great a cost. Its not a long exhibit, probably 1 - 1 and half hrs tops, but it was very interesting and we are glad we came across it."

I actually loved my evening on this boat, and actually took the steering wheel, and steered it under this bridge, so really fond memories for me! until the tragic disaster! Even though I saw the horrific tv, I will not let my four girls travel on the thames, only because of my memories! and my \"close call\". The bridge looks amazing! and shouldnt be put off by my close encounter with tradgedy! So many people, travel on the river every day, weekend, and should not be put off by my review!"

Tower Bridge, one of London\u2019s most famous landmarks, it has a two sided suspension bridge combined with a spectacular drawbridge completely accessible, surrounding areas are rich in culture and heritage.I should get up early to witness this soft, backlit view of London's illustrious icon and photograph it before everybody show up from every direction, as you know some of us travelers are not always a early riser. Walking on the Tower bridge is fun, people smile at each other, when the traditional red double deck bus goes by, people yell and wave at ya ! It's fun yet bit silly. LOL. I thought I could walk all around the bridge and photograph it from all different angles, till I realize it is very BIG area to cover in one day. On my next trip to Tower Bridge, maybe I should rent a bike instead.UK weather been good to me during my entire visit, therefore, I could take many photos in good light. Too bad there's not much to do on the bridge but soak in the great view!"

So, we walked over to the iconic Tower Bridge for a look. Yes, it is good for some pictures, and views of the Thames, but there are exhibits here as well. We got to see the original steam machinery that raised and lowered the bridge, go up in the towers, and walk across the HIGH part of the bridge. An interesting diversion."

You'll pass the HMS Belfast and pubs on the walk and pause for some breathtaking views of the bridge from the west side.Take your tripod for night photos and have a pint at a nearby pub.

It's grand like few other bridges are. It's a one of a kind part suspension and part bascule. It opens 3X per day. The times can be checked on the bridges website. Easy to get to by the tube (hop off at the Westminster Station). If you have a London Pass it can be used here. Costing 8 Pounds at the Bridge ticket booth, discount tickets are available online of 20%. 2 for 1 coupons are also sometimes available. It's also on the Hop On Hop Off bus tour. The Tower Bridge Exhibition Tour includes: a video about how it got started and it's design, walkway on the top with wonderful views and information posters about the bridge and other bridges around the world, and a tour of the engine room that opens the bridge. You can be Photoshopped in front of the bridge. I can't remember the price."

Totally worth it, starts with a video of why the bridge was built and later on there is another showing the scematics on how it was built. in between there is this exhibition on the great bridges of the world, which makes an interesting vieweing. They have started an exhibition on the Olympic cities as well, with small nuggets of info. The views are great as well, especially since I had gone on a rare sunny clear day! :) After this, you go down to the engine room, below the bridge. Fascinating to see how they managed this during the Victorian days and how they have changed to modern electric engines. All in all, a great visit."

Around Tower Bridge and between it and London Bridge (foreigners often confuse the two) are at least 27 pubs serving England's great traditional 'real ale'. Try the Draft House, on Tower Bridge Road, just south of the river, or the Dean Swift, around the corner on Gainsford Street, or the Shipwright's Arms on Tooley Street, The Market Porter or The Rake in Borough Market. As for the bridge itself go into the museum and see the great hydraulic engines once used to raise its bascules (now down electrically) or climb up the staircase to cross the river the way people used to do up until the 1920s when it was closed because of overuse by prostitutes for 'quickies' in the alcoves."

There was then another video and then a walk up the other walk way showing pictures of Olympic cities over the years. No guides. Nothing. We were then ushered downstairs to see some of the equipment used for working the bridge. This would have been fascinating, had there been someone there to bring it all alive. Instead, we had written information to read. . . which is all well and good but you can't beat having a human to tell you little nuggets of information.

Brilliant experience walking along the walkways at the top of the bridge which is 139ft above the Thames... granted you pay \u00a38 pp, but you can spend as much time as you like up there savouring the views... The olympic rings had been hanged from the bridge on the day we visited and on the east side of the walkways there was a history of all the cities that have hosted the games since they started in 1896.. On the west side there are many pictures and facts about famous and historical bridges from across the world.. Access to the engine rooms is also and included in the ticket price and it's always nice to see how things work... Beautiful British engineering at it's best..."

Not only are you in/on the most famous bridge in the world, but you get to see two short films which explain how the bridge was conceived and how it was constructed.Truly fascinating. There are also photgraphs and displays of the most iconic and unique bridges throughout the world and specifically other cities which have held the Olympics.The views are spectacular from the top of the bridge and the walk around the engine rooms help ou to grasp the engineering feat that the bridge was and still is. If you visit the website you can find the times the bridge bascules are raised which completes the 'story'. In case you weren't aware, London is hosting the 2012 Olympics and this iconic bridge is now adrned with a model of the Olympic rings which quite frankly, look as though they've always been there! The fact they get raised as the bridge opens is quite an awesome spectacle so get there soon!"

Its normally \u00a38 per adult to get in, which to be fair in London is a good price. You go up to the top by lift and watch a short film detailing the designing of the bridge before you then walk across the top of the bridge through the covered walk ways. Along each walk way there are lots of information boards, interactive screens and small sliding windows where you can take a photo through - an excellent idea! There is another small video you can watch showing the making of the bridge, in a room where the ceiling has been removed exposing all the beams and metalwork to the roof which is an impressive sight. A lift takes you back down and you exit the bridge following a blue line along the floor to the \"engine room\".The engine room is worth the \u00a38 in itself, its so impressive. The huge boilers and machines which were used to power the bridge are restored so well, and the sheer size of the machinery is well worth a look. We came out feeling the exhibition was well worth the money even at full price, with the 2 for 1 its excellent value for money and well worth a visit."

The rest of the tour is \u2018on your own\u2019 and done mainly via helpful pictures and well-placed factual texts on both sides of the bridge\u2019s walkways. The views of London from these walkways are just terrific! The tour ends in the engine room of the bridge.

You find yourself attracted to it - I think it's the subcomscious thought that it's a cantilever design and the road can actually split and raise up on either side, as many a famous plotline has highlighted. Problem is, they hardly ever open the bridge so, once your hopes of seeing said bridge open are dashed, it's a bit disappointing. And it doesn't lead anywhere - the fact is you're going to find the bridge by accident, approaching it from the North and there really isn't anywhere worth going to at the South side, so you just end up walking back over it, still with the vain hope of seeing it open suddenly and a Hackney cab make a last-minute hurling jump towards you from the other side."

You could either cross the bridge and visit the Tower of London or stay south of the river and have a lunch around the picturesque Bermondsey street (for instance Zucca, Jose, Pizarro, Magdalen, etc).Enjoy."

Easily the most recognised icon, the Tower Bridge is probably more spectacular from the outside than from the inside. If pressed for time, the Tower Bridge tour can be given a miss. Make sure to walk up and down the Tower Bridge and read the plaques that give a brief glimpse into its history. If you have time, do take the Tower Bridge Tour that takes you inside the Bridge. Here are life size working models of the original hydraulic equipment, though the working mechanism now is different. Just looking at the massive pistons is fascinating. You will also get a quick lesson in the physics of the drawbridge, the history, vintage photographs and a short film on the bridge. Not a must do, but if seeing how things work excites you, then go for it. Budget an hour for the tour."

While the Tower Bridge is certainly one of the most impressive and iconic portions of the London skyline, its real value as a \u201ctourist attraction\u201d was, in my opinion, rather limited.The Tower Bridge (not to be confused with London Bridge which is far less aesthetically impressive) is located in close proximity to the Tower of London and the HMS Belfast and is easily recognizable as it links the north and south shore of the Thames. The best way to get to the Tower Bridge is probably by taking either the Circle Line or the District Line on the Underground and getting off at the Tower Hill Station. Disembarking here will let you out just north of the Tower of London and within easy walking distance of the Tower Bridge (2-5 minute walk). There are also a number of Bus Lines which will drop you off in close proximity to the bridge.The bridge itself is visually impressive and it was somewhat surreal to be standing on the same structure I have seen countless times on T.V. and in the movies. There are any number of different views and angles for camera happy tourists to take all the pictures they want, however, I would suggest that visitors avoid actually going into the Tower Bridge Exhibition (TBE) itself.Visitors to the TBE enter on the north shore of the Thames, are taken up an elevator to the top of the north tower and then let off on the upper walkway between the north and south shores. Visitors can pretty much take as much time as they want in the exhibition, however, unless you have a real love of bridges and bridge design (which I do not), the TBE isn\u2019t really anything to write home about. The views from the walkway are OK, but I was very disappointed that you DO NOT GET TO GO OUTSIDE and the views from the walkway are often obstructed by the many photographs lining the walkway which depict famous or historically significant bridges from all over the world. I was hoping to get a couple of really good photographs of the Tower of London, but was unable to do so because of the layout of the \u201cexhibition\u201d. I was actually quite annoyed by the whole thing and was ready to leave almost as soon as I got off of the elevator. Once visitors are finished with the walkway, you descend the south tower into the engine room to see how the drawbridge was designed and how the bridge itself is raised and lowered. While I am certain that there are people out there who are fascinated by this sort of thing, but I thought it was a total waste of time.Looking back, the TBE was far and away my least favorite part of our trip to London. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved seeing the bridge, but in truth, I thought that the TBE was a waste of 8 pounds (about $12.50) per person and I would strongly caution anyone other than those who have a very distinct interest in bridges from wasting their time with a tour of the TBE. Instead, consider taking a tour of All Hallows Barking by the Tower, which is a church located on the west side of the Tower of London. Trust me, you\u2019ll take far more away from the church and the history it contains than you will from the TBE."

I\u2019ve wanted to visit this for a few years but something else always gets in the way so it was great to finally get there.The attraction itself is fairly reasonably priced and you can easily spend a good couple of hours here. There are 2 walk ways facing north and south and each have some great views, the only way you would get a better one is on the eye. Along the walkways there are plenty of bits of information to read about the bridge, other info on London and also about other bridges, there are also some computerised quizzes to take if you wish. In the 2 towers there are videos to watch about the history and construction of the bridge. They are on continuous loop so if its half way through you can wait for it to start again, nobody is rushing you along. Once you have finished in here you then leave the towers and make your way to the engine room where you see historical engine parts and get told about how the bridge opened in the past and present. There is a lot to see here in quite a small space. There is also a lot of interactive things to have a go at here. All in all a great visit and although I wouldn\u2019t go back every day I would definitely do so some time in the future. I would recommend you visit on a clear day as you may not get a good view from the towers if it is misty."

Now they are for viewing and also for functions like my Birthday party. We had a couple of hundred people, I have the view that they came for the place rather than my party, and I can not blame them, it is iconic both in terms of what it is and where you are. You can see all the workings, great videos, and fantastic views of London and the Thames both day and night you would have a job to beat it. So as I now say come to my Bridge."

The times on the board said that last admission was at 5pm; we showed up at 4:30 and were rushed through everything. Honestly, right from the point when we paid there was someone constantly behind us saying \"move along hurry up\" and it was getting on my nerves. We came up on the side that faces downtown, the less scenic side, and when I had walked through there I wanted to see the other side. So when I made it to the other Tower (where you could cross over to the other side) there was this woman standing there telling me to watch some film. I said I wanted to see the other side first and she said \"no watch this video, you're running out of time. I just walked past her and went to the other side. I got to take my pictures but had no chance to read any of the info on the side because there was a guy who kept telling you to move along. I don't understand why we were rushed through when the last admission is still half an hour away. I wasn't impressed with the people. The tour is alright but if you don't make it there, don't be too upset, the view is just as nice from the bridge itself. Also, you can get a 2 for 1 deal for this location so keep an eye out for the 2 for 1 pamphlets! I wouldn't do this again if I go back to London."

            "review": "A great landmark that could be improved as an attraction. This was one great landmark that I'd missed, the famous bridge that sometimes gets confused with London Bridge but is as iconic as St Pauls when we think of London. My original thought was simply to see the bridge but once there it's not so easy to appreciate because its busy, it's too close to get much in a photo without a very wide angle lens and it quickly becomes obvios that to get a full sense the structure will involve entering those famous towers and crossing the high walkways above - this means paying for the Tower Bridge Exhibition, entered through the ticket office at the North Tower. Entry was straightforward but annoyingly everyone going in, at the time of writing, was ushered in front of a coloured backdrop and photographed. No explanation was being given but it turned out to be a sales opportunity and you are offered the chance to have your photo superimposed against the tower by the time you come to walk past a stall set up in the South tower. This was starting at around \u00a315 and may be something you would like. To me it looked like basic Photoshop and a little tacky, certainly I didn't appreciate not being asked at the outset but simply being photographed. I think they need to think this one through and there is no reason why the camera couldn't be set up near the stall when you could see what it's for.As for the visit, passing through the ticket area you enter a lift where a very brief outline to the visit is given. On exiting, high up in the North tower, a second guide gives less guidance but was briefly available for questions. From here you are pretty much on your own, there was no guided tour. I quite like that and the fact that there is no restriction on photography because I don't like to be tied to an organised group, but for the money you might expect a little more. From the lift you walk across the high East walkway to the South tower. This gives good views and although the walkways are completely enclosed by some form of plexiglass there are thoughtfully placed little windows positioned every so far along each walkway to allow for phtotography. Once at the South tower you turn right and walk over the West walkway for the views down the Thames including HMS Belfast and beyond. This is a dead end and you have to walk back to the South tower to head down the stairs although I found little to indicate that I was heading in the right direction for the engine room ehibition and there was no-one to ask so I carried on down the winding staircase to find I was outside the gents toilet at another dead end. The exit is back up and past the stall offering photos. Once out and another member of staff appeared who took me and a couple of other visitors down. At the base of the South tower you follow the blue stripe marked on the ground back over the bridge and down below the North tower to enter the engine rooms.Here again you are on your own to walk past the two boilers, the coal bunker and finally around the two original steam engines. These are nicely kept but not so impressive for anyone who has visited a half decent steam museum. Beyond is a small exhibition area including a model of the bridge that can be operated and a few hand on items that the children might like to play with. There are also what I assume to have been two huge couterweights visible leading up into the tower. There was no-one to ask and I didn't want to look for a printed description so there may have been one that I didn't see. These were impressive though just in terms of size. Overall I thought the towers could be made more of. The emphasis is on the engines, but the structure of the towers themselves, visible in parts, seems to be largely neglected. It's as though the working of the bridge and not its architecture is seen as the only point of real interest. It's half the price of St.Pauls if you want to go in but for that I wasn't that impressed with the arrangements. To cross those walkways and experience Tower Bridge you have to go through the exhibition, but I wouldn't say it was great value. Do it to say you've been in and crossed the higher walkways on the bridge and not for the 'exhibition'."

This is another London landamrk that you should capture to remember your trip by. Although the attraction is quite cheap and gives some great views along river if your time is limited in London there are plenty of better attractions but if you have the time then visit as it is good and informitave, would be good for families with children."

The tour was really informative and never became boring and the walkway between the two towers gave the most impressive views of london (in my opinion the views were better than the ones you got on the London Eye). If you go to London i would definetly recommend a trip to the tower."

This was a very neat trip I took when I had a layover in London,,, Instead of sitting in my hotel room and doing nothing, I got onto a Night Tour for the evening which was SO COOL.. on the tour we got to go everywhere, one stop was the tower bridge! Very Very Neat!!! I wish I could have gotten down from the bus and walked aroud a bit.. enjoy the little pictures from the night tour."

The bridge sits besides the Tower of London which is a historic castle and now holds the crown jewels.

Even if you're a Londoner I'll bet you don't know 80% of what you'd learn about the bridge in an hour's visit.You go in at the foot of one tower, up in a lift and walk across one of the covered walkways to the second tower; back down in a lift, then a walk along the bridge and down into the engine rooms. Truly a masterpiece of engineering.Some short and really informative films on the way round.Currently it's only \u00a36 per adult (under 5s free) which makes it one of the cheapest attractions in London. Probably an hour would be fine, and you should find time to fit this in.Hints: 1) Do a search online to check scheduled bridge opening times and you might see it in operation. 2) When you come out the engine rooms, if you head towards city hall there are some nice cafes and restaurants (and public toilets), or you can go the other way where there are some excellent sandwich shops.A minor negative re access - The lift in tower 1 takes you to the top, the lift in tower 2 is accessed by going down 4-5 flights of stairs. More stairs down to the engine room entrance, and I couldnt see any disabled/pushchair ramps. But I guess you can go up and down in the Tower 1 lift... check before you buy your tickets."

Went with 2 OAPs, and family with 2 kids (girl 11, boy 8).We visited this right at the end of a day, so only had about 45 minutes to see everything. That said, we didn't miss much of it so I wouldn't expect to be there for much more than an hour unless you have an unhealthy fascination with bridges. The exhibition is essentially in two parts - the walkways at the top of Tower Bridge, and then the engine rooms at the base. The bit you have to do is the walkway - if you've ever walked under the bridge, getting a chance to walk on the top bits is probably the main reason you'll go here - but actually it is the engine room that is more spectacular. The walkways are okay - with a light but interesting exhbition on bridges at the moment (one of the walkways is closed for refurb at the moment, with cheaper tickets as a result). The views are okay, but pictures are difficult due to the large amounts of metalwork in the way. We whizzed through these to be honest, and thought we might not get our money's worth. But when we went to the engine room we were pleasantly surprised - the engines are great and then there are lots of fun things to play with, including models of the bridge. The kids (and the adults...) really enjoyed this bit.The gift shop is overpriced and underwhelming.The staff were all friendly and helpful.If you are going, get the 2 for 1 tickets from National Rail. We didn't know whether to rate this \"average\" or \"very good\" because we thought it was \"good\" for the money we paid with the discount. If you pay full price, I doubt you'll feel it was value for money."

My two sons and I finally plucked up the courage to visit the Tower Bridge Exhibition today and are now really glad we did. The entrance is a short walk from Tower Hill tube station (and the Tower of London). It wasn't that expensive for the 3 of us - \u00a312.50 in total. You don't have a chance to worry about the height of the walkways because the exit from the admissions desk is straight into a lift which very gently takes you straight up to the top (you don't even feel it moving). You come out still inside the tower, and after watching a short film, you then walk onto the first walkway. Now we had fears of being able to see all the way down, it being open to the elements etc, but it is not - there is a carpeted floor, fully glazed windows, and you can't even see straight down outside the windows (ie you can't see the bridge below you, and in fact we missed it opening while we were \"upstairs\"!). The views are wonderful! First you go down one side and look out towards Docklands, Canary Wharf, o2 Arena etc. Then you go into the building at the other end and come back along the second walkway and look out towards HMS Belfast, St Pauls, etc. Having retraced your steps back to the 2nd tower you then walk down some steps, past another film, to another lift which returns you to street level. You then walk off the bridge to go and view the old steam engine rooms and mechanism that used to lift the bridge. The tour ends in the obligatory shop.All in all a very enjoyable and memorable trip which we would recommend for some great views and very interesting history."

I didn't go inside and I'm really happy because staying out I met some wonderful people (like anywhere in London) I had the opportunity to talk to them and exchange some opinions on London.The Tower Bridge is a famous landmark so many people will go there, take picture and go further.What I did was to attend a street performance, near the city hall and play with some little children near the Riverside Estate.:)The Tower Bridge is close to London Tower but not so close to the \"London Bridge\" tube station so if you experience walking difficulties you might want to take the RV1 bus which will leave you just on the bridge.Good luck!"

We used supermarket reward vouchers to try during a weekend in London recently - and were really disappointed with this one (but glad we hadn't handed over sterling!). Granted, it was a cold February day, but the whole experience was quite sterile - especially according to our ten-year-old, who when asked for his opinion denounced it as \"tacky\". Quite. Firstly a wait for a group lift, rather pointlessly accompanied on the way up by a cheesy guide (we would have been happy to climb stairs, if there had been the choice...), and then two videos, plus a walk across and back at the top on carpet (randomly scattered with a rather sad 'exhibition' of reproduction children's toys) and with the construction itself behind perspex or glass, mostly obscured by a photographic exhibition of the world's bridges, so that the view itself was only partial. it was as if we were walking down the corridor of an underfunded school artroom just before closing time, rather than thrilling at the sights, sounds and the bracing elements - a nod to Health and Safety, no doubt.We were all expected to follow a series of numbers like sheep, one of which took you back along the other wing of the bridge only to turn round again at a dead end - we asked if we could skip this bit but were told we had to do it. The young multinational staff seemed as bewildered and disengaged with the whole thing as we were. The engine room was more aesthetically interesting but no better displayed, again roped off so that us sheep had to follow the route as if we were in Ikea (which is free) - it's also an outside walk along a blue-painted line across the road bridge, and then once finished we were left with no choice but to cross an extremely busy road at a point where the pavement finished due to roadworks, to double back and, yes you guessed it, cross to the other side again. Overall the exhibition content, the formulaic presentation, the lack of excitement and the numbing of the sense at the top made this the one dull experience of an otherwise fantastic weekend. Sorry Tower Bridge, but this really was badly organised and a bit lame."

We used Tesco vouchers to pay for us (under 5s are free) so it didn't really cost us anything. We went on 30th December and it was a foggy day but not too cold. We didn't have to queue to get in, so within a couple of minutes we were at the top of the tower. We were given a 'passport' for our son and you could collect stickers around the bridge to stick on this to make your own bridge picture, which he really enjoyed doing later that day.Although it was a bit foggy to see everything clearly, we still really enjoyed it. All the information is heavily picture based and at a low level so our son was able to learn quite a lot about the history of the bridge with a little help from us.The engine rooms were not quite as interesting to begin with, although there are some good interactive activities for everyone to do that explain how the bridge works, and they were easy enough for our son to do. He also enjoyed seeing the part about stunts on the bridge.A great attraction for a family who is interested in that sort of thing.....our son is and his father is a design teacher/was architect so it was really good for them."

At \u00a314 for 3 of us I felt it was excellently priced and didn't disappoint. (Why can't more attractions take note adn charge appropriately, they'd get more people through the door then). There are a couple of short films to watch, one at either end, both are short, so you're not bored watching them. You can walk along both sides of the bridge offering fantastic views along the Thames and each side has an exhibition, about bridges in general, the Thames and specifically, of course, about Tower Bridge. My son found this very interesting and loved finding out about all the landmarks that we could see. Afterwards you walk along Tower Bridge to the engine rooms. There is information and hands on exhibits along here and you are not restricted at all from taking pictures. However we were expecting it to be working, but it isn't, it's just now a display, but interesting all the same.It is not guided which is great as it means you can take as long as you like and we spent much longer than I expected - over 2 hours. Overall very happy and would definitely recommend to others as a must-see experience."

As students, we bought a join ticket for the Tower Bridge and the Monument for 5.50 pounds and were done with the exibition in about 45 mins with no rush. First, you view a short video on the constuction of the bridge, which was pretty interesting, then an elevator takes you up to one of two upper walkways. The views are great, but nothing special, many places in London offer the same for less. The exibitions were boring and did not have much information on the bridge, as it relied on other facts such as the Plague, Great Fire of London and other bridges of the world...You then desend via stairs and follow the blue line outside the bridge to the Engine Rooms and the shop. If you are pushed for time, dont bother with the exibition, just admire and take your photos of the bridge on the foothpath like all other pedestrians and from afar."

It\u2019s probably fair to say that she was more interested than us because of her complete obsession with this place, but that is not to say that we didn\u2019t enjoy it too. The views from the walkway along the top were absolutely super....and cheaper than some of the more known high rise view points in London. My favourite bit, however, was after we came out and saw the bridge lift. It was my turn to be a kid then...I\u2019ve been to London countless times but never saw TowerBridge open. It was amazing to see. The exhibits could be a little more interactive perhaps, but this is an inexpensive (for London anyway) must-do that didn\u2019t disappoint.

There are some very informative videos about how the decision was taken for the Bridge to be built, and how much effort was put on its construction. The views are magnificent too, and worth to take some time just to look around you on both Thames' directions! The engine rooms are included in the entrance fee, so you can have a look there too. Although I am not very much into mechanic staff, I found them to be quite fascinating! It's intresting to see how such a huge structure was made and then could be opened for ships to pass under, on eras that technology was not so developped, and lots of human effort should be put in the task,Take some time to admire the outside too. Nice architecture, and bridge colours with its light blue and some red and white are beautiful (although the original colour was brown)."

Thanks to London Mayor...Good Maintenance!!!!!There is an Exhibition gallery at the top of bridge, which is remained open from 10. 00 AM to 5.00 PM in normal summer seasons.

It's cool to say you've walked accross the bridge above, but I wasn't impressed with the views too much. The bridge is actually kind of far from all the main attractions so there isn't much to recognize. You don't get big, open windows up there that take your breath away, there's always metal beams in the way as you peek out a little section. The exhibition is good for the history of the bridge though. There's a couple of short videos and models of rejected proposals which I found interesting since I knew nothing of the bridge. You'll also get to see the old engine room with all the big brass steam compressors. It's worth a quick look even if you're not into old marvel technologies. In summary, your day will be much more memorable if you time it right for a lift schedule."

It details how and even why the bridge was built, and delves through its fascinating history and provides stunning panoramas of the city from the dual walkways 14 stories above the river. Be aware that the queues for this may be very long as the elevators are small and the exhibit area space limited."

Feels much bigger inside than it appears from outside. Talk an elevator to top of one tower, walk across walkways, and down the other tower (there's a giftshop at the bottom). Short walk from Tower Hill underground station, past Tower of London (great views!)."

The bridge itself is impressive plus the views are fantastic, the heavy lifting gear is great, I thoroughly enjoyed explaining to my kids the heavy engineering principles that powered the raising of the bridge."

It was easy to get to, it didnt set us back a ton of money, and my husband loved the engineering exhibit. There are great views of Londonfrom the catwalk. It is a good activity to do in the beginning of the day, its quick so there is time to do something else (e.g. the Tower of London) before lunch."

            "review": "Pleasant Surprise. London was a brief stop-over on our way from New Zealand to Ireland so we were incredibly jet-lagged, sunburnt from few days in Thailand and fuming from BA losing half of our luggage but we had some time to walk around London and the Tower Bridge was definitely a sight worth seeing!We had no guidebook and didn't expect to see much of London while we were there but we looked at a map and thought we'd go to London Bridge...mainly because of that song of London Bridge falling down.... we had no idea where we were going so just ended up wandering around and found Tower Bridge by complete accident! Sounds silly I know.... Immediately we recognised the bridge from images of London and were thrilled to actually be there. The architecture and design is very impressive and for the first time in my life I was actually interested in the history and background of the structure. We walked across the bridge and considered doing the exhibition but with the sterling to the NZ dollar we decided not to and we're probably lucky we didn't having read some reviews about it. You get enough information in a guide book.We witnessed the bridge being drawn up for a ship to go through which was very impressive - especially with the speed and efficiency of the whole procedure. I would definitely recommend seeing the Tower Bridge - one of my favourite sights in London - and then to see the Tower of London as well."

Few items on display & divided into 2 parts - - one has to walk to the other side of the bridge for end of the exhibition.However, if one wants to get a view of the Tower from the top of the bridge, is okay.So, if one decides to see this attraction, one must remember that he is paying for the view and the elevator ride, not for the exhibition."

If you are a person interested in how the bridge moves aside for shipping this is a must. The inside offers viewing of the previous hydraulic mechanisms, a tribute to Victorian and early 20th century engineering. All indoors. Good visit with children."
