While just at the edge of the desert, the camp was better than expected with running water and real beds. Said was the star of the show, helpful, informative, and very personable. Learned so much about Berber culture and history. Great trip, good value and highly recommended."

            "review": "Beautiful Trip. We went on a three day/two night tour to Merzouga with Said and it was a pretty breathtaking trip. First of all, Said is just a masterful host. He's a kind and authentic dude that does this job because he loves to share his country with travelers. The trip is a well curated journey that never feels manufactured or exploitive. I think the routes change slightly from trip to trip, but the terrain is stunning and the stops are well considered for their historical/cultural impact. Said is also always on hand with interesting bits of Moroccan history, anecdotes, local folklore and advice. One of the best parts of the trip was listening to his stories. The company is very good at communicating pre-trip, in our case we were talking directly with Said from the get go. They were able to arrange pick-up, hooked us up with veggie meals wherever we went, and thoroughly answered all of our questions about the excursion. I've heard some of these tours can be manipulative in terms of their stops and hidden charges/route changes along the way, but there's not a shred of that going on with these guys. There's really just a strong sense that they want you to enjoy yourself and have as authentic an experience as possible. Can't recommend this company enough, by far the best part of our time in Morocco. Thanks again Said."

            "review": "A trip worth a thousand and one words. This was our first time visiting Morocco and we definitely made the right choice by choosing this tour. I picked this one specifically because I didn't want a tour company that had seen so many tourists that they start to not care about taking people around their country. Where it\u2019s more a money-making business, where you are part of a big group and you will not receive any sort of bespoke individual experience. We were so lucky to have Said as our tour guide as he was a genuine and nice person, who loves his country. From the very first email Said was extremely polite and helpful, more than any other tour company I'd spoken to. We ended up travelling with just him, my husband and me. We went from Marrakech to Ait Ben Haddou, to the Todras, Atlas Mountains, several Oasis and obviously to the Sahara desert. It was still a whistle stop tour as we only had 3 days but it was definitely the way to go. Having stayed in Marrakech for 2 days I was very much ready to leave the hustle and bustle (and generally being harassed at the souks) to explore what Morocco was really about. At Ait Ben Haddou, you can ask them to organise a tour for you if you want to hear about the history and get taken around. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too expensive. We didn\u2019t because we weren\u2019t that fussed. But Said couldn\u2019t take us because only specific tour guides are allowed (stimulating the economy I guess!)Todras gorge was really lovely. There had been some rainfall so you could walk into some of the water. Really nice. It was quite busy though, but no more than the other big landmarks like Ait Ben Haddou. My favourite place was actually Skoura, one of the little Oasis on the first night. The place we stayed was run by a family business and you can really tell. It was remote, but stunning. Not at all touristy, and very authentic. The food was the best I\u2019d had in Morocco, just divine! Just as an aside, although I love tagines, you do want some change, so this was the one that stood out as it felt a little more authentic. Most of the food you\u2019ll get in Morocco (not just in the tour) is very similar \u2013 varying types of tagines, wraps or kebabs, with rice or salad. Not a huge amount of variety unless you really look for it. We loved Nomad in Marrakech, this restaurant has amazing food! The trip to the Sahara was amazing, albeit short. We set off on camel when the sun was quite low, maybe 6-7pm and then arrived at the camp by nightfall. We had dinner with a few other people on the tour, and the locals did a song and dance for half an hour or so. We then ventured out to the desert to see the stars, and although we went back to the camp around 1am, the moon was so bright you could have slept under it for sure. The temperature was perfect. However we had to leave at about 5am to catch the sunset, so thought we\u2019d better sleep in the bed. The camp was extremely clean and nice given it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere, so if you\u2019re a clean freak like me, you\u2019ll have no problems! There\u2019s good toilets and running water. You sleep in a type of metal room, which is probably ventilated but still quite warm. The beds aren\u2019t exactly comfy, quite hard really, but there\u2019s electricity and sheets, what else do you need!One thing to keep in mind if you do this tour, which they\u2019ll tell you anyway, is that it is a LOT of driving. The journey from the desert back to Marrakech was around 10 hours. And obviously getting there is the same distance but broken up, which is still hours in the car. I guess if you want to go all the way down to see these amazing places it\u2019s the only way. But if I had a choice it would have been nice if I had more time so we could spread out the drives. You can see more of my adventures and what I experienced from my pictures. All in all, what you see is what you get. The tour speaks for itself. You visit all the places on the itinerary and you\u2019re greeted with nice people and go to places that are really quite unique. On top of that, you\u2019ll be with a guide who knows a good deal about Morocco and will work hard to make sure you have a good time. We were even privileged enough to see Said\u2019s home, meet his family (they were very shy!) But an insight into how Moroccan people actually live? That is something you can\u2019t buy.Also want to point out that the value of this tour is by far the best compared to all the ones I looked at on Tripadvisor. Offers more and doesn\u2019t charge all this other random things like other companies do. One thing to keep in mind is that if you do meet people and speak to them for any service (like visiting a site and getting a brief history, or going to the toilet, or just at restaurants), generally they expect a tip. Same goes for places you eat at, just a good idea to keep change around. I would think about 10% each time, but it\u2019s at your discretion. Really enjoyed my time in Morocco, so thanks to Said and the team at Morocco Desert Trips for being so accommodating!"

            "review": "Two-day private tour to Zagora and Marrakech half-day tour. My wife and I traveled to Morocco for the first time in September and decided to book a two-day private trip to the Zagora desert, as we were only staying for one week and only had limited time. Said informed us that larger tours move a bit more slowly and we would probably have more autonomy if it was only us. This trip was the absolute highlight of our entire week in Morocco. Said arranged our transportation, meals and site visits, but also engaged in very interesting conversations about the history, politics and future or Morocco while taking us off the beaten path to really experience the country.We drove through the high Atlas Mountains, stopping frequently for pictures, snacks and a bit of shopping. All of the locations he recommended were top-notch, and would have been difficult to find without him.We always felt safe, informed and engaged in the country and culture.Morocco Desert Trips took all of the guesswork out of the journey, and allowed me and my wife to relax and take in all the beautiful sites and experiences of Morocco. Said is a great guy who I feel fortunate to have met, and will definitely call up the next time we travel to the area.I only wish I had known more about what they offer before booking. These guys can pretty much tailor fit a package for you to fit your specific needs, so be sure to send them an email with what you are looking for and they can create something perfect.Said showed us a part of Morocco we never would have seen without him, and for that I am immensely grateful."

We didn't know what to expect but the itinerary was what we were after. As it turned out, we had no worries. It was worth every durham. Our driver Larbi was not only a capable and safe driver but had a great knowledge of Morocco and it's culture. Everything was organised through Said, who we had the pleasure of meeting in his family home during the trip. Said was very accommodating and did a great job organising our adventure into the Sahara. The accommodation was very good and the meals we had were some of the best food of our entire trip to Spain, Portugal and Morocco.We had the awesome experience of sleeping under the stars in the Berber camp in the Sahara and observing both the sunset and sunrise in the desert. Magical!Thank you to Said and Larbi for all your good work and hospitality. I don't want to sound like an advertising brochure but I would highly recommend anybody looking for a great desert experience to look no further than Said and Morocco Desert Tours."

In search for the best tour, we found the great reviews for this one so we contacted Morocco Desert Tours. Said was our person in contact and he offered us every detail about the itinerary, accommodations and everything we could ask for. We chose the 4 days - 3 nights desert tour option and although we found it a little pricey at the beginning, it toured out to be the best part of our vacation. It was worth all the money because the memories we did in our 4 days trip were the best ones that we\u2019ll remember looking back.We saw some breath-taking places, we stayed in wonderful riads, we experienced the desert and the real feeling of Mor\u200b\u200bocco as Said has chosen the very best for our trip. It\u2019s a unique opportunity to have a Berber pizza with a nomad family so if you\u2019re thinking \u200bbetweem the 3 day or the 4 day trip, we would strongly recommend the second option.We felt safe and very welcomed in every place and \u200bSaid was very attentive to our needs at all time.Dear Said, thank you for your part in our journey. We had so much fun and enjoyed \u200bevery moment of our trip together. Shukran! :)"

            "review": "Moroccan adventure at its finest. We booked this tour by email. You have to wait a few days for the reply but Said always answered our querries. He was very accommodating too. He was on time to get us at our Riad. We traveled with another couple so we got the tour cheaper. We had the 3days, 2nights tour to the desert and we didn't regret it. Despite the long travel, there were lots of coffee/toilet/picture breaks. Said showed us picturesque views along the way, occasionally stopping for some photos. He was a very good driver too. On day 1, we saw some Berber villages along the way and visited 2 very old kasbahs, where some famous films were shot. We slept at a beautiful and quiet hotel (Dar Panorama-it's small but clean with a very nice view outside) in Skoura Oasis. On day 2, we passed by valley of the Rose and Dades Valley, with breathtaking views of a village with some greens. We arrived at another hotel where we freshened up/took a shower before heading to the desert. We had a camel ride to the desert and stayed overnight at a Berber tent where there was Berber music and some Moroccan food/tea. The bed was comfortable enough at the tent. There were toilets outside. Early the next day we headed back to the hotel again (via camel) for shower and breakfast. Then back to Marrakech via Draa valley and Atlas Mountains, again a very scenic ride. Said gave us lots of interesting informations about Morocco along the way. He gladly answered our questions and brought us to good but affordable resturants. At the end of the journey Said asked us on how they can improve their service. He patiently waited until the Riad owner picked the other couple and brought us to our own Riad. He even gave us his no. so that we can call him if there was any problem during our stay in Morocco. He is like a friend you can trust when in Morocco. I highly recommend this tour if you want to see Morocco in a different non-touristy way. It's worth all the money, time and energy\u00fc"

We went on a private 3 day tour - fully recommend the guide, Said as friendly, knowledgeable and does his utmost to unsure you have the fullest experience depending on your wishes. Really outstanding. Really nothing to comment on in a negative way at all, wish it had been longer. Fully recommend this tour if you wish to experience real, rural Morocco and see some of the most stunning landscapes. On top of the price I would recommend taking around 800 DH for lunches/tips and extra things you may wish to experience although not necassary for this much. Very glad we took this over a large group tour."

            "review": "Outstanding!!!. My daughter and I planned a week-long vacation in Morocco as part of our 3-week vacation overseas. My initial thought was to plan everything on my own (as I usually do) as this cuts down on costs and leaves us with the flexibility to do as we choose and to change plans on the fly. This has worked for us in the past and I figured that it would be ideal for Morocco.However, I did have worries about safety and security and with wanting to see more than the typical tourist sites. I corresponded with many different companies before settling on Morocco Desert Trips and in particular, Said. Said was always prompt and helpful in his replies. He was honest in his assessment of our proposed itinerary and made suggestions on how it could be more efficient. He even suggested possible ways to spend less money - I appreciated his honesty and feedback and this was ultimately why I chose him and his company.We basically spent our entire time in Morocco with him. I am skeptical by nature but our entire tour was absolutely amazing. He gained our trust almost immediately and there was never any concern about our safety or getting value out of our trip. He set up a fantastic itinerary that allowed us to visit the wonders of Fes, Marrakech, Chefchaouen, Skoura Oasis, Merzouga and camping in the desert. One thing to note with Said is that you are always in complete control of your itinerary. If you need to make revisions and slight changes on the fly, he is very accommodating. It sincerely is his goal to make you happy and to ensure that you are getting what you want out of the trip. As a result, we enjoyed an absolutely perfect week in Morocco. We got to see what we wanted to see and we never had a worry about our safety, our security and whether or not we got full value for our money. We travelled in comfort in his air-conditioned 4x4 and all of the accommodations that he booked for us was first-class. I was a little hesitant about having someone else book our accommodations without first doing some research of my own but we had absolutely no complaints. In fact, in doing some checking up after the fact, all of our accommodations were highly rated in TripAdvisor and all of the booking websites - these were places I would probably have booked on my own.I know that I am missing much, much more in this review but suffice to say, we were extremely happy with our trip and with our decision to go with Said and Morocco Desert Trips."

We booked the 3 days and 4 nights TRIP A with Mustapha via MoroccoDesertTrips.com .The first guide Said came at our hotel in Marrakech pick us up at the door. The 4x4 was great and had a wifi hotspot. We left and explored all the way to The Dad\u00e8s Gorges where we slept for one night in an Auberge/hotel. The next day we met our second and last guide Mustapha who brought us through Merzouga and the desert where we slept in a Berber camp. The next day we slept in the Nomad Palace which seems to be the only near \"hotel\" in the desert. For the last day we travelled to our final destination F\u00e8s.Overall this was a great experience, the guides are friendly and speak proper english/french/spanish/arabic (from what I've seen). Throughout the trip you visit several places where you can buy souvenirs however you are not harassed to do anything. Be prepared for a lot of traveling because it is far from main cities obviously but worth it in the comfortable 4x4. What's great about this trip is you can ask the driver to go where you want as it's a private tour. Mustapha was a very interesting guide we were with him for the most part he knows the place and was interesting to travel with. The one thing I would like to see improvement has nothing to do with the company it's about the Nomad palace which was partially in construction and offered minimal services.It was an excellent trip thanks to Morocco Desert Trips."

A totally unforgettable three days in the desert, in no small way because Mohamed Aghdaomi, our guide, went above and beyond to give us the most authentic tour possible. Riding camels out to camp overnight in the desert, trying a wide array of cuisine, seeing such a varied terrain, and hearing about the history of the Berber people were all highlights. If you want to see the Sahara, this is the way to do it. Thanks to Morocco Desert Trips and Mohamed for a great time!"

I can't recommend him enough! Said worked with me for weeks beforehand on some complicated logistical issues, and he made special arrangements to accommodate our dinner plans. Due to some last minute travel glitches on my end we had to depart for the excursion a bit later than we had originally planned, and Said was super accommodating the entire time. Of course the excursion was absolutely amazing. It was so authentic compared to other proposals we received, and it ended up being one of the most beautiful parts of our trip. (Our quote was also extremely fair and reasonable compared to others for much lesser quality excursions.) My friends are still raving the experience, which is hard to even put into words. We rode camels and enjoyed traditionally-prepared tea at sunset in the middle of a stone desert with no one around for miles. It felt surreal. And they brought a few baby camels who were \"learning\" which obviously was one of the most adorable things imagineable! Don't hesitate to book with Said. He's a true professional (along with the other guides who accompanied us) who genuinely cared about making our experience amazing. He succeeded 100%! I had high hopes for this at the outset due to all of the positive reviews, and it turned out better than I imagined. Thank you, Said!"

It happens sometimes that a particular phrase, which you would hear from a complete stranger without any obvious reason would stuck in your head and would stay there as a tantrum for a long time. This is what has happened to us in the very first hour of arrival to Morocco. A lady - owner of the small hotel in Marrakesh (I understood she migrated herself to Morocco many years ago from France) told us that Morocco is like a Closed Castle (Kasbah) with quite reserved culture and traditions; and if you are lucky enough to open the doors of this Kasbah you would understand the Sole and Heart of Morocco; however if you won't succeed in doing so - you would be just wasting your time there. We've had an unbelievably wonderful trip with my wife starting with the city tour in Marrakesh, 3 day desert trip to Merzouga, and returning back to Casablanca; and for the whole journey from the very moment our plane landed in Marrakesh and till the time it took off in Casablanca, we were accompanied by Said, from Morocco Desert Trip, who helped us to break the spell and to \"open the doors of this Castle\"; not to say that the majority of stigma we had as those people who previously experienced Africa only through the National Geographic Channel eventually disappeared. Great thanks to Said and Abdul (our driver) whose help with we succeeded to open up the True Moroccan Oasis, which initially we were erroneously looking for somewhere around Scoura or in many other similarly beautiful places; we are really happy that finally we found this oasis within the hearts of simple Moroccan people..."

Due to adverse weather conditions we were not able to take the regular route and had to to go via Midelt in order to get to the Sahara. Larbi made sure that the longer journey was broken up as much as could be and we stopped at some great places for lunch! Once we had arrived at the Sahara it was an experience that we will never forget, the camel ride to the camp is a great experience and the staff are very funny and friendly. The food at the camp was lovely and staff did there best to talk to all guests and get people involved when it came to the traditional music! Waking up to see the sunrise on top of the dunes is something definitely worth waking up for.The drive back to Marrakech was again a long one but Larbi stopped at several interesting places on the way to make the journey fly by.Overall an amazing trip and made possible by Said and his team at Morocco desert trips.

He is educated, speaks excellent English and is very knowledgeable in just about every subject connected to Morocco, including painstakingly trying to explain the Western Sahara to me. On a lighter note we greatly enjoyed hearing about Moroccan wedding customs, Berber history, including their alphabet and even visiting (from afar) what will eventually be one of the largest solar power stations in the world. We also appreciated the beautiful roses he bought for us in the valley of the roses. Just one of the little personal touches that made this tour special. The drive over the Atlas Mountains was breathtaking, and our two excursions into the exotic Ait Benhaddou and Taourirt Kazbahs were very educational. Everything on our tour was well organized down to the last detail and included a wonderful meal organized at the last minute with a local Berber family, who served us the best couscous in Morocco (recipe appreciated)."

One of our favourite experiences came on the final day when, since we'd been talking about our interest in Moroccan cooking, Said arranged for us to have a home-cooked meal with a local family. The food was delicious and we all felt genuinely welcomed. I'd expected a booked tour, even an excellent one, to feel 'touristy', but Said made everything feel like a road trip with friends.

So here it goes:We booked the following tours with Said:Two day, one night desert tourHalf day Marrakech tourTransfer from Marrakech to CasablancaAs you can see we pretty much relied on Said almost our whole stay in Morocco and I have to say that it was the best thing we could do!First we started with the half day tour in Marrakech. In the morning a man named Kamal came to pick us up. I did not know then that Kamal was one of the best drivers we ever had on our tours. Simply put he was friendly, forthcoming, patient with a great English and a good sense of humor. He was also our personal Dj and put on some nice tunes for the road!! I want to add that he is also a professional driver and we were never afraid with him on the road.We have seen many things in half a day but the tour was not rushed at all. After having one day off we started the 2 day desert tour. Fortunately we had again Kamal as our driver. We already knew from the start that it will be great. In the meantime I was always in contact with Said through e-mail so if we had any questions he was also there for us.After a few hours into the tour we had a nice surprise of meeting Said as he was also driving another couple who booked the same tour. After that almost every time we had our break we got the chance to sit down and have a talk. Said is a great person, very friendly and helpful so it was a great pleasure to also meet him in person.Of course, the two day tour went great and we had absolutely nothing to complain about!We can say that having booked the two tours and the transfer with Said, we could not be happier about the professional service we received!All in one I have to say that I would encourage everybody traveling to Morocco who is searching for a trustworthy and professional company to contact Said. After the first mail you will most probably feel at ease and book a tour with him!! ;)Thank you Said and Kamal for the great and unforgettable Moroccan experience you gave us!!!!Regards,Ervin"

            "review": "Perfect. Before coming to Morocco we thought long and hard with which company we should book our 1 night/ 2 days trip to the desert. Based on reviews we chose to contact Said and \"Morocco Desert Trips\" for this purpose. Now after going with Kamal, our driver, to this trip I consider that the reviews don't do them justice. The trip was perfect; Not amazing, not good or other attributes - it was simply perfect. Said was very easy to talk to and very friendly. After he arranged the tour he also suggested a half day tour in Marrakech which we also accepted and also helped us with the transfer from Marrakech to Casablanca. Lets go on to the half day tour:Our driver, Kamal, found our address, picked us up without delay and showed us what was most important in Marrakech. Although unplanned he gladly gave us some time to have breakfast, took us to the best spices shop and much much more. When we asked where we could find a supermarket to buy water and some beers we thought he would show us the place on the map - we could not have been more wrong. He drove us there, waited until we finished buying things and helped us carry them!Not to mention the fact that Kamal had to pick us up at 8:30 am for the desert trip but we arranged with him to start at 7:30am in order for us to get \"a breakfast with a view\"Now, for the fun part:2 days later after we met Kamal, he again picked us up and we started our journey to the desert. As promised he drove us to a place to have breakfast which was at least breath taking. You would expect to pay at least 50% more for food when you book a tour because of the deals that the guides have with restaurants right? Well WRONG! Amazing food, amazing coffee and breathtaking view at a decent price - even low compared to other places. During the whole trip Kamal answered our questions, told us facts about everything in Morocco, was our personal DJ and drove at his best because one of us was car sick. I'm not going to go on about the views and landscapes because it would be to much but I am going to say this: Kamal managed to keep us on track time wise whilst stopping at every beautiful thing so we can take some photos and learn something new. The desert itself was beautiful, the camp and people there very nice, the food and tea were awesome and the music was authentic. After our night there, Kamal gave us the bad news: because of the rain, a bridge in the Atlas mountains (our only way back) collapsed. That meant we had to go to Agadir first and then to Marrakech to literally go around the mountains. The way back was awesome. We saw new places, ate BBQ goat and beef and had the most amazing time!I can go on and on about this trip but I don't want to spoil it for you.To sum it up I will say this:1. It was easy to organise and very fun to take part of2. Kamal and Said are amazing people3. Our trip wouldn't have been the same without themIf you decide to visit Morocco I most definitely encourage you to contact Morocco Desert Trips for the perfect holiday!"

We also added a day tour of marrakesh through the company so we spent 5 days with Said. I would highly recommend the 4 day tour verses the marrakesh excursion out to the desert and back because we felt like we got to see a lot of the country without feeling rushed. I have only compliments for the company and would highly recommend them."

We made a half day tour around Marrakesh with Kamal and everything was perfect. He took us to all the main places in the city and was always willing to stop for a picture :) very kind and patient.Then we went to the desert for two days with Larbi. Great trip! The car was really comfortable and we enjoyed every bit of the tour. Larbi is a very good driver and a very good guide that knows really well all the places we visited. He cared for every detail and made us feel really welcomed. Excellent restaurants and food and the night in the tents in the desert ...unforgettable!The tours were coordinated in advance by email (thanks, Said!) and everything worked as planned. Thanks, guys, for such a good service."

            "review": "Mostly good but with some problems. We booked the 3 day, 2 night trip to Merzouga from Marrakech by e-mail with Said. As others have mentioned the communication was clear and efficient. Kamal was our guide and was very helpful, knowledgeable and kind, especially given that I was unwell during most of the trip (travel sickness on the first day crossing the Atlas and upset stomach for the remainder of the trip). It was great to see such diverse, beautiful landscapes and get to know Morocco better. Also we enjoyed lots of the shops we stopped at (such as in the Valley of Roses where we bought rose cosmetics and in Merzouga where we bought scarves and spices). We were lucky to experience a snow storm on the return journey to Marrakech which completely transformed the landscapes and gave us a different view of the Tichka and the Atlas mountains.Unfortunately there were a few issues with some of the trip:-The restaurant we visited on the first day for lunch (L\u2019Oasis D\u2019Or in Ait Ben Haddou) was a total tourist trap-poor quality, overpriced food, very limited menu and terrible service. We were not given a choice about where to eat and I think that people doing the tour should be given the option to choose where to eat. The restaurant we had lunch at on the last day (Cafe Almanadir) was also distinctly average, at best. -Before visiting the desert we were brought to a shop to buy scarves for the desert to protect us from the sand. It's not a big deal but this was a separate expense that should maybe be mentioned when booking.-The desert was, overall, a disappointing experience. Firstly the guide who took us into the desert on the camels spent almost the entire 1 hour trip on his mobile phone. He completely ignored us and we got a very bad vibe from him overall. The camp itself was a disappointment also, mainly because there was no music provided (as described on the website- \"amazing Berber music show\"). When we mentioned this to Said he told us that we should have requested this ourselves in the camp- this was never mentioned to us by Kamal or Said at any point so it is an unacceptable excuse. We were really very disappointed about this. -The guide spoke to us only after the 1 hour trip back to the hotel the next day when he stopped us before getting there, made us get off the camels and proceeded to try to sell us some (vastly overpriced) soap dishes/other handicrafts. At the hotel where we had to shower in the morning after the desert unfortunately the showers available in the little outhouse were not working- one was completely broken and the other had only scalding hot water so we had to travel 650km back to Marrakech without showering.Despite the above there were also some highlights such as the Dar Panorama hotel in Skoura which was very calm, clean, friendly and welcoming. The food for dinner there was also very good. The restaurant where we had lunch in Erfoud (Cafe-Restaurant des Dunes) was great- surprisingly tasty food with reasonable prices. Overall we enjoyed the trip but would recommend that certain aspects be revised, especially the restaurants visited and the camp/guides used."

We booked the trip mainly for the desert trip, but were pleasantly surprised by the diverse landscapes (snow-capped mountains, beautiful valleys and gorges) along the route. The hotels were very good and convenient. Kamal was very patient and helpful: he arranged vegetarian dinners for us, acted as translator at some of the shops and really went the extra mile to make sure we get the most out of our trip.

He was incredibly friendly and a fountain of knowledge! Our first trip was an over night Sahara tour. We started in Marrakesh and drove south, over the mountains, to meet our ride to the desert camp ground. Along the way, Said shared the history of each region and highlighted interesting spots along the way. The drive back on the second day was just as engaging- new sights to see and stories to share. This trip was so fun and well organized, we decided to book a second tour with Said, a day trip to Essaouira. The drive to the coast and back and comfortable, safe, and fast. Throughout both trips, it became clear how well connected Said was throughout the region. His influence helped make both trips even more meaningful. Thanks for an amazing introduction to Morocco!"

The Sahara trip is one of the most important reason for us decide to go to Morocco. I have been asked around 5 companies, with different reasons I was not satisfied, then I found Said through Trip Adviser. Because the reviews about him and this company was really good, so I sent Said an email, we started contact, Said was not just friendly with patient. But mostly importantly he gives very good suggestions also options which not in the point of view as businessman but friend. I have never been to Morocco so had lots of questions, I believe before we arrival Marrakesh, he have replied me at least ten emails with all my necessary and unnecessary questions.The day we arrival Marrakesh, Said came with us for a half day City Tour, he was very on time, and we did enjoy Marrakesh so much even the time was limited, but he really tried to let us have the most of it. Also he explained us the whole plan for the following day Sahara trip. The Sahara trip started really nice, because one of our friend normally have car sick, we thought with mountain way will be really difficult for her, but Said\u2019s driving skill was really good, so my friend was absolutely fine for the driving trip. Everything for Sahara trip was perfect, we reached on time for sunset, was beautiful , we have been treat really nice, and enjoy the night spent in Sahara. And we will definitely go back join a longer trip with Said. And will recommend said to anyone we know if they plan to go to Morocco!!!!!!!"

Said was our point of contact with the company and he was fantastic right from the start. He was quick to respond to my many emails and even gave advise on how to organise the tour to minimise my travel sickness! On the first day, Said met us at our Riad on time and took our luggage to his well-maintained 4x4. Although each day's travels were long, Said catered to our every need, be that rest stops, photography opportunities or simply answer our questions on the area. The tour was well managed in terms of time and every night we stayed in beautiful accommodation and served hearty traditional food. I have taken many tour in multiple countries. For us, what made this special was the personal touches. Said really listens to your interests. As we passed by his family home, we stopped in to have tea with his mother and see how rural Moroccans live. After I showed an interest in their farming, he arranged a friend of his to guide us around the fruit groves and small holdings. Best of all, after discovering I had arranged the night's stay in the dessert to fall on my birthday. He traveled through the dessert in the dark to surprise me with a birthday cake! That really was a fantastic night, celebrating in the tranquil dessert with friendly strangers, dancing to traditional music.For all of this, he expected no more than the originally agreed, very reasonable price. Said really does believe in delivering exceptional service.Throughout the trip we felt safe and achieved everything we had set out to do and more. I would definitely recommend this company, and Said, to fellow travelers."

We emailed MDT and they got back to us straight away with recommendations and options to suit. We chose to go to Zagora for a two day, one night trip with a camel trek to the edge of the desert and overnight stay in a Berber camp. From the outset the guide was extremely friendly and professional, advising us of exactly what to expect all the way. He was an excellent and safe driver, had a modern 4x4 (it was just the two of us and him on the trip), which I was relieved about as the drive over the Atlas Mountains is very windy. While the trip to Zagora and back is a long drive (8 hours each way), we didn't notice it so much as the guide had so much knowledge about the region and culture to share. He also stopped for photos and coffee, and lunch. We were very lucky to be taken to his house to meet his family on the way home. To see inside a local family's home was a real treat. We're very grateful. But most of all, the guide was very punctual as we needed to be at Zagora by a certain time to make the camel trek to the desert before sunset. The timing was perfect. He left us with a Berber guide who led us for just over an hour to a desert Berber camp. The sun was setting as we made the trek and it was magical. Other people doing a similar tour arrived to the camp late and had to make the trek when it was dark which wouldn't have been a great experience. At the camp we had a private tent, lots of blankets, our Berber hosts were very friendly (we weren't sure what to expect), they speak 3-4 languages. They cooked us a wonderful turkey tagine, we drunk tea (whiskey of the desert) and sat around the campfire beating drums. The sleep in the desert was strangely quiet except for the moaning of the camels! The camels are all beautiful, well looked after and the Berber people clearly have great respect for their animals. For sunrise we made the trek back out to meet our guide and stopped at various places on our way back. We got back to Marrakech about 7pm. It was a long day driving, but worth it. Because of all the knowledge of our guide, we felt much more able to understand Moroccan customs for the rest of our trip - tricks of the trade etc. Tips: tip the Berber guides at the camp, try to learn some Berber/Arabic, don't give money to the Berber children when your guide drops you off, get to Zagora before sunset, take warm clothes."

Said was very helpful and accommodating and helped to arrange the trip for us at the last minute via email.Said collected us from our Riad and we were driven in his 4x4 to Agafay. We then went on a camel ride across what are like sand dunes and the view is amazing! There is nothing for miles and it's so peaceful and serene. I was a bit worried that the camels would be tired (carrying us for a whole hour) and at one point mine starting to veer off in the wrong direction when he saw the hill he was going to have to climb! But the man who owns them and guided them across the sand dunes with us was kind to them and I think they are well cared for, so it put my mind at rest.We then arrived at a spot at the top of a 'sand dune', where Said and his colleague had set up an area for us to watch the sunset with Saffron Tea and Dates. It was beautiful!We relaxed for a while and then drove back. I had asked Said if we could see the stars and he did try and stop at a spot for us to view them, but unfortunately the moon was too bright at the time. We then asked if he could drive us past the New Town (newer part of Marrakesh) and he drove us there on the way back to our Riad so we could see the shops and Casino etc. Very helpful and accommodating!We are now considering going on a tour with Said to the Sahara in the future.The trip is a little expensive compared to some offers but it is worth it as the experience is private and a lot of effort is put in by Said to make sure you are comfortable and happy."

Our guide Kamal looked after us until the last possible moment when he dropped us off to our riad in Marrakech at the end of the trip - a huge thanks to him. I will say that it's not cheap, but it's definitely worth every penny for the overall quality if you're looking to do a tour like this.We look forward to coming back to Morocco!"

My husband and I were up at sunrise on January 1st to drive through the Atlas Mountains; by lunchtime, we were enjoying a terrific feast with a mind-blowing overlook of the desert oasis; a few hours later, we were riding camels through the desert witnessing one of the most incredible sunsets I've ever seen in my life to the Berber camp where we would spend the night. We spent the first night of the new year huddled around a fire staring at the most incredible expanse of stars we have ever seen in our city-dwelling lives -- an absolutely unforgettable moment. The Berbers we met were so friendly, funny, and charming -- as were the other tourists staying at the camp with us. We made genuine new friends for life. For all of this, we are incredibly grateful to Said. We booked an overnight tour of the Zagora with Said after our previous booking fell through -- and I couldn't be more pleased that we ended up with Said. Our tour with Said was cheaper and included more than the previous tour had. Said was extremely quick in responding to my inquiries. Our driver Kamal was so friendly, helpful, informative, and cheerful -- not to mention an absolutely top-notch, fantastic driver! We had such a terrific and enjoyable experience with him.

We just sat back and enjoyed the trip, no hassle. Make sure you get to the desert before sunset, we did and it was great. Good transportation, hotels and guides. Might be a bit more expensive than other desert tour operators, but you get what you pay for - which is a much more relaxing and enjoyable experience."

From when we first made contact with Said to when we were shaking his hand goodbye, we had a wonderful experience--we took a three day desert trip (we should have gone for longer--Said did try to warn us!) and a half day tour of Marrakesh. I wouldn't have learned a quarter of the things I discovered about Morocco if it weren't for Said's willingness to answer my constant questions about the way of life and culture of the places we visited (as a former philosophy teacher he has a wealth of knowledge and endless patience). We're sure we saw some attractions off the beaten track that most tour companies would not have taken us too (would every tour guide climb date palms to throw to you the best, ripest fruits?), and everywhere we went we felt like Said ensured we were well taken care of--he clearly chooses his partner businesses discerningly. After three days on the road, we even had the honour of meeting his family and having his mother's cous cous for lunch! If we ever go back to Morocco, we'll definitely look Said up again--we can't recommend him enough if you want a private/small group tour of this amazing land."

From the very beginning when booking this tour, Said went out of his way to ensure we got the trip we wanted and the best value for our time. We wanted to do 2 day desert trip and our time in Morocco was limited, and Said was very honest about how far into the desert we would get within 2 days, leading us to decide perhaps a mountain day trip would work better for our schedule. His honesty and dedication to giving us the best tailor made experience for our time was very impressive and the reason I chose to tour with them. The day trip was seamlessly organised and tailored to us, Said arrived perfectly on time as promised, despite our riad being new and difficult to find. His knowledge of marrakech and Morocco is vast and his english incredible. e learnt so much from this philosophy graduate about his country that he is so passionate about, it was incredible to learn from him, one of the highlights of our tour. We drove to three different valleys in the Atlas mountains during the tour, visiting a berber house, argan oil producer (at my request), a small farmers market and the Ourika valley waterfall. We stopped off for photos whenever we liked, despite being grey and overcast with a forecast of rain and storms, the views were spectacular and the smell of pine and fresh apples will stay with me forever. Though sometimes I am nervous passenger in steep mountain roads, Said is an excellent driver and his car so comfortable and well maintained that I never felt anxious once. Even though it was a long drive with lots of ground to cover in one day, the stops were frequent enough that it never felt too much, and we had a great walk up the waterfall in the middle of the day, perfect to build an appetite for lunch. Said has gotten these tours down to a fine art and was always charming, patient and ready to answer any question we had. I would not hesitate to book another tour when I return ext time and look forward to learning more from this well educated, passionate tour guide. Many thanks again Said!"

Morocco Desert Tours is well-run and a great value. Based on tripadvisor reviews we booked a three day private desert tour from Morocco not really knowing what to expect. From the start Said was quick to respond and lay out our options. He met with us at our riad in Marrekech prior to our tour to go through the agenda, to answer any last minute questions and to collect payment for the tour. He has a number of drivers that he uses. Our tour guide was Larbi. Larbi is a nice, friendly, chill, professional man who speaks great English (as well as many other languages). He picked us up at our riad and drove us over the Atlas Mountains to Ait Ben Haddou and then on to Skoura - stopping at various places along the way for pictures and lunch and other interesting places and kasbahs. The valley on the southern side of the High Atlas is a magical desert dotted with beautiful oases. Skoura is the best thing ever. The next day we headed to Erg Chebbi, stopping at the Todra Gorge and other interesting sights along the way. In Erg Chebbi we road camels for an hour across the dunes of the Sahara and then camped under the stars in a comfortable tent with a mattress. On the final day we trekked back to town and then drove through a savannah landscape back to our riad in Marrekech. Larbi was a great guide. He was very flexible and happy to make any stops that we liked. All of our accommodations were arranged by the company, including breakfasts and dinner and were included in our fee. Fees for admission to points of interest and lunch during the day were additional (though not expensive) so bring some cash (Larbi pulled over for us to get some more cash from an ATM at one point). All in all I give MDT 5 stars and recommend then without any reservation. They are flexible and can customize the tours to fit your preferences/schedule. Thank you Said and Larbi!"

He was so personable, kind and definitely genuine in his interest not only in what we wanted to do but he took an interest in myself, my husband and our teenage daughter. Said was so responsive and flexible. I must admit we had been expecting he would be our actual tour guide for our three days and were a bit disappointed only because that had been our expectation, however, it turned out fine and we did get to have Said for a further 1/2 day tour of Marrakech after we returned that we booked on the spur of the moment. He went out of his way to make that happen for my daughter and I. Said's customer service is outstanding. The actual desert trek we did was three days; we were met right on time on the first day of the tour at our Riad by Larabi - he was very professional, quiet, but helpful whenever we needed it. He answered all our questions and was very good at making sure we knew what the plan was for each day, and where and when we would be stopping etc. The Riad they chose for us to stay at the night before we headed into the desert was lovely and very welcoming. Our guide, Omar, who took us on camels, into the Desert for the night was fantastic - he made that part of the trip really enjoyable. Riding camels was definitely an interesting experience as was sleeping in the desert - a definite must do once in one's lifetime. We highly recommend it! This is a really reliable company to work with and one you can trust thanks to Said's personality.We chose Morocco Desert Trips because of all the fantastic reviews we had read on Trip Advisor and it was definitely the right choice! You will not be disappointed once you connect with Said. Thank you Said from your new Canadian friends :-)"

I had lots of email communication with Said and he offered us some great advice which helped us decide which tours to take in the time we had available. As well as airport transfers, which were fantastic, we did two tours with Morocco Desert Trips. The first trip was the 3 day 2 night tour to Merzouga (the Sahara). We really enjoyed the two day drive to the desert which included driving through the Atlas Mountains, Berber Villages and visiting the Ait Bed Hadou Kaspah amongst other sites. Our driver Mohamed was great and stopped for photo opportunities and was able to tell us lots about Berber life in the villages. The B&B we stayed in on the first night was a real treat, it was very traditional and the hosts were extremely welcoming - highly recommend it! I became quite ill with a dodgy stomach and after several emergency stops in less than an hour Mohamed was very good and brought me to a pharmacy, translated for me and seen to it that I remained hydrated. He insisted I ate only rice for my meals that day and this was just what i needed, I could not thank Mohamed enough for the amazing care he showed me. The camel ride to the desert was a real experience and a must; prepare yourself for a sore bum! The desert is something that everyone should see and experience. We saw the stars before it got too cloudy but unfortunately we could not watch the sunset as it was still cloudy in the morning; this did not stop us climbing a massive sand dune and running around in the dunes at 6.30am in the morning. The nomad camp we stayed in was a little disappointing as we were the only people at the camp and it was really lacking in atmosphere. The trip is sold with dinner, traditional music and dancing which was not what we got at our camp. We had dinner which was wonderful and then we were walked over to a neighbouring camp for 20 minutes for the music and dancing. This was nice but we did feel very left out as this camp was full to bursting everyone had gotten to know each other there so we felt very much like we were tagging on. This definitely had a negative impact on our desert trip and I would recommend you ask Said to book you into a bust camp if you are going. There is not much to do in the desert without the music and dancing! The final day travelling back to Marrakech is a long days driving (around 10 hours) but these are the sacrifices you have to make.Do also note that there are charges for tours/entry at all the stops along the way to the desert. This came as a shock to us as there was not prior mention of it. be careful not to overpay as some tour guides certainly took advantage of us.We also went on a one day trip to Essaouira with this company. Our driver Larbi was EXCELLENT! His English was fantastic and he taught us lots about the various places we passed on the way to the coast! Essaouira has a beautiful fishing port, beach and medina and is definitely worth a day trip. While there you must go to the fish market and have your fish grilled for you while you wait....I have never tasted fish with such flavour!!These tours are fantastic, they are really well organised and the drivers always come on time. Morocco Desert Trips is a professionally run company and goes over and above for it's clients. I highly recommend them."

We booked an all day tour to the Atlas Mountain as well as the Half-Day tour in Marrakech. In short, touring with this company was a wonderful experience! I communicated with Said via email prior to the trip (about 3 months in advance) to arrange the tour and iron out any details. Said was very responsive and helpful through email and described what we should expect, where we would visit, as well as any pricing for the tours. No monetary transactions were done online and everything was taken care of in person when meeting with our guide. Upon our arrival we communicated with Said and met with our great guide, Larbi! Larbi's English is great, my family and I felt very safe with his driving, and he was extremely attentive throughout the tours. When visiting the Atlas mountains it was clear that he knew the area well and was able to show us beautiful locations for photo opportunities! For lunch he took us atop a mountain with the help of a local guide onto the home of a Berber family who welcomed us with a delicious home-made meal, which we enjoyed with an amazing view. It was truly an unforgettable experience for the 5 of us!The next day, during our Marrakech day tour, Larbi met with us at our Riad once again to begin our private-vehicle (similar to Atlas mountains) tour of the city. It was another fun-filled day with Larbi as he showed us the Bahia and Badii Palaces, Medina wall, short tour of the new city, and Majorel Garden (breathtaking!). We also visited the Palmerie, and had the opportunity of dressing up in traditional clothing to have a half an hour camel ride around the Palmerie. Larbi clearly had great relationships with all the local guides who helped us, and we received excellent service wherever we visited. Both nights for dinner, Larbi made reservations to excellent, prestigious restaurants, where the food was absolutely fresh and delectable. We truly got a taste of the traditional Moroccan cuisine, thanks to this tour! Our 2nd day of the tour, we asked Larbi if he would recommend a restaurant where we'd experience a belly-dancing show, and not surprisingly, he did not disappoint! The tours with the help of Said and Larbi, was by far one of the best experiences we had during our 10 day trip around Morocco. Said and Larbi, thank you for making us feel welcome from the very beginning. We truly appreciate all your attentiveness, friendliness, and knowledge during our tours. It wouldn't have been the same without your help--you made this trip very worthwhile and if given the chance, we would definitely choose your company again! Forever grateful!! Cheers from New York!"

Larbi had very good English, was very interactive with our boys (and especially helpful when our youngest fell after lunch one day and had glass stuck in his arm), was responsive to all of our questions and seemed to enjoy his job.Probably the best part of the trip was the locations they picked for us to stay\u2026.some very out of the way, interesting places with excellent views and to a person the places they chose were staffed by happy, friendly people. They clearly have very strong relationships that they have built up over time with the local vendors. Some of the roads Larbi took to get us where we wanted to go would never be found by a tourist driving on his own (but absolutely safe). His local knowledge and rapport with everyone provided us with an \u201cin\u201d everywhere we went.Our time overnight in the desert is one our family will remember forever; this is a must do.

The journey itself was an adventure zooming through the desert up and down at times rather hairy inclines/declines, but at no time did we feel unsafe at all, or in any danger, it was fun. We stopped off on the journey for some of the party to climb this rather step hill where breathtaking views were to be had.. A couple of men came by on their donkeys, on the way to their very remote hamlet in the middle of the Agafay Desert. We then arrived at a flat plateau where carpets were laid out, a fire built and moroccan tea brewed, lovely morrocan nibbles and cakes were served while we watched the most magical sunset in the peaceful silent desert.

We set off early in the morning. Kamal picked us up from our hostel and was very patient while we finished up breakfast. On our first day we visited the High Atlas mountains. We stopped to view a local Argan oil cooperative. Kamal was very knowledgeable of the best sights to stop at and take pictures and to tour. We visited the famous Kasbah where they filmed part of the Gladiator. Kamal arranged for us to have personal tour of the Kasbah by a local resident. We ended our first night at the Skoura oasis at a magnificent hotel that clean and full of charm. The second day Kamal took us to the Gorge's where we took amazing pictures. Kamal always has surprises and along the way to the desert we stopped at several places for pictures and tours. We later arrived at hotel that is right outside the Dunes where we would be camping for the night with local Berber residents. We rode camels to the campsite. We spent the night eating traditional Berber and listen to Berber music. We woke up early the next day to catch the sunrise and headed back to the hotel. Kamal was there to great us and got us on our way. We thought this was the end of the trip but Kamal took us to a local village to listen to Gnawa music. We stopped at another oasis and took in other sights in the way back to Marrakesh. We had a great time with Kamal. He was excellent and went the extra mile to ensure we enjoyed our trip. We highly recommend Kamal and Morocco Desert Trips!!"

We were only in Morocco for 3 days, so a day tour to get in as many sites/attractions as possible was a must! I checked out the day tours at Morocco Desert Trips and instantly discovered countless rave reviews on not only this company, but on one tour guide, Said, in particular. I immediately made contact with him and was glad that I did. From the very first point of contact to the final second of the tour, Said did NOT disappoint! His professionalism, his wealth of knowledge, his amazingly down-to-earth and friendly attitude and his willingness to make our tour as comfortable and enjoyable as possible all made for an unforgettable trip! Said was a gentleman in every way and even accommodated a last-minute request to change a minor portion of our tour. We went to the Agafay desert (definitely FUN times in his 4x4 up steep sand dunes!) where we also saw a movie being filmed, we had lunch at the stunningly beautiful Lake Lalla Takerkoust, drove through the lush and breathtaking scenery of the Atlas mountains and Plateau du Kik, drank tea at the home of a charming local Berber family, visited Argan oil cooperative, and Said was even kind enough to squeeze in a bit of the Medina for us to view because we would have left the following day without seeing it. And all this at a price of 40 euros per person was unbeatable! We definitely recommend Morocco Desert Trips to anyone wanting an EXCELLENT experience - whether short or long stay - in Morocco! Don't forget to ask for Said! :))"

We did a lot of planning last minute, and Said was very quick in responding to our request. We had a few responses about a two day tour, but decided to go with Morocco Desert Trips as they were humble and very accommodating. As we only had two days, Said informed us before our booking that two days from Marrakech, we would only get to experience the smaller dunes.Muhammad was a great tour guide - always willing to stop when we wanted to take photos - he drove a lot over the two days!the camel ride, and tent sleeping was an experience! Said and Muhammad were helpful along the whole way of our two day trip - they even helped us buy our train tickets and also took us to a local hammam at the end of the tour! we got to see the local side of marrakech and this was invaluable!"

We were offered an airport pickup and transportation to our Riad, which was great as we arrived late in the evening and Marrakech was a little overwhelming at first. From the very beginning our guide was very welcoming and informative as we drove towards the medina. Not to mention his great sense of humour automatically putting us at ease!Although there were weather issues that caused complications with our plans Said did his up most to tailor our tour in order to give us the best possible experience. Each and every place we stayed in was friendly, beautiful and provided amazing homemade Moroccan dishes. Our favourite Raid was in Skora, the food was amazing, the view was breath taking and the hospitality of the owners made us feel right at home. Another obvious highlight was the overnight stay in the desert. The sunset and sunrise camel trek was a unique and beautiful experience, as well as sandboarding under the stars! All in all our Moroccan experience was absolutely amazing and this wouldn't have been possible without the help our of guide. Always friendly, striving to better our trip and giving a great insight not only into the way people live, but also the history and politics of Morocco."

Fun, relaxing trip that gave us a chance to get outside Marrakech and see some of Morocco\u2019s beautiful countryside.Said was a great guide, communication before the trip was very good, he took time to answer all the questions we had (including questions about whether their would be vegetarian food available) and gave us a detailed itinerary of what the day would include.On the day itself, Said met us at our hotel and drove us out to Ourika valley, stopping off along the way to visit an Aegean Oil producer and to cross a rope bridge. He stopped the car for photos of the Atlas Mountains whenever we asked him to and we both enjoyed the drive, he gave us lots of information about Moroccan life and made sure we were happy throughout trip. Once we reached the valley we were introduced to the local Berber guide (the cost of which was included in the fee) and he took us hiking up a waterfall. On the way we were able to stop and look at all the beautiful things created by local artisans.After the hike we had a Moroccan lunch, which wasn't the best meal we had in Marrakech but was fine, it's worth asking Said beforehand if you have particular special dietary requirements. We were then being driven back to Marrakech with a short stop off at a traditional Berber house overlooking the valley. The day lasted 8 hours and was an truly unforgettable experience.A few tips if you're taking the tour, wear comfortable shoes with good grip for the walk up the waterfall and bring a big bottle of water as it can be difficult to pick some up along the way, all costs are included in the tour fee but we did feel a bit of pressure to spend money from the local merchants - if you want to avoid that then maybe mention it to him before you set off."

These were great added extras that I know we will remember for a long time.The highlight of our day was a trip up the waterfall. Whilst it was very cold, we enjoyed the walk very much. Remember to wear suitable shoes!! It was very steep in places. There were several souvenir shops along the way but there was no pressure to buy anything. Our guide took plenty of photos of us along the route. In total, it took around 1.5hrs to go up to the top and then back down. Afterwards, were were again greeted by Said and we had lunch in the traditional restaurant, which was included in the tour fee.Overall a great day and we will definitely book a desert tour if we return to Morocco!"

My wife and I were on our honeymoon in Marrakesh in April this year and were keen to get the balance of a chilled holiday following the excitement and stresses of a wedding. We opted for a day trip to the Atlas mountains as one of our excursions - and were extremely glad that we did! Our guide Said was absolutely superb. As well as being extremely knowledgable about the area and the people, he was exceptionally engaging and personable. He was also very much on his guests' side when it came to visiting tourist attractions - he has a policy that if he finds out a shop or attraction has charged his guests too much, he will not take guests there in the future. When a passing tradesman stopped on his moped to sell us fossils - Said spoke with him and told him that he 'does not bring tourists up to the mountains - only friends' and that he would only accept a fair price from him. Trained in philosophy, Said is a real gentleman and his top priority on an excursion (and it seems in life) is that his guests enjoy themselves and take away a positive experience of his beautiful country. I can categorically say that both my wife and I did - thanks to him. The day trip itself is ideal for those who are not staying in Marrakesh for too long (we were only 7 days). It was only a couple of hours drive to get up into the mountains. It is not a strenous day and you are in the vehicle taking in the sites for much of it (and they are stunning sites!) but there are plenty of opportunities to get out and the trip takes you through authentic, old settlements - with time to peruse around. The day culminates in a late lunch at a great cafe with stunning views over the river - followed by a small excursion up to a couple of waterfalls (about an hour and a half trek up and down). We found that it gave us a real flavour for the area and a desire to go back for more (hopefully in the future we will go back to do some proper trekking in the mountains). We booked Said in person - as he was driving us into Marrakesh from our hotel (the highly recommended Sirayane Boutique Hotel) as part of their free shuttle bus service - but you can book him directly through http://www.moroccodeserttrips.com/ One things for sure - when we do make it back, we will be in touch with him to go on one of his longer trips!!"

He even stopped off a few times on the way for us to look in some local side stalls. When we arrived an hour later firstly at the place where they make the famous argan oil we had a small tour around and had the opportunity to buy some oils and spices. We then carried on making our way up the mountains. We arrived and started our walk up the mountains with a separate tour guide. It was beautiful! I would say take some comfy shoes as the rocks are a bit big to climb and it's uphill but the views are beautiful. Once we got to the top there was an amazing waterfall, a good opportunity to take some pics. We made our way down and stopped to have lunch on a roof top terrace over looking the river and mountains. Then made our way to a local Berbers house to see how they live. Defiantly an eye opener. We then made our way to Marrakech while Said told us more about the local people and the beautiful country of Morocco.

We have got some amazing pictures even better memories and our legs weren't even aching by the end. Our lunch stop was great overlooking a river and the mountains and the food was good and fresh. We saw some berber villages and children and then we started our small trek to see the waterfall. Its about a two hour part of the day and some negotiating with rocks but my word well worth it for the views. Just make sure you have sensible shoes on, some people we saw were trying to do it in flip flops. When we come again we'll be contacting Said again for a desert trip. He spoke really good English and this trip really made the holiday. If you want a similar experience look no further."

I I am travelling with my wife, two children aged 5 and 9, elderly parents in law and my wife's siblings and their respective partners.We were collected from our hotel reception by a well dressed, punctual (can be a problem in Morocco) and extremely polite and well spoken man - Said. We travelled in comfort towards the Atlas Mountains and en-route stopped for a tour (booked by Said) of an oil, herbs and ointments production place where we were shown manufacture of cosmetic oils and were able to purchase spices, soaps and cosmetics and a fraction of the UK retail price.As we arrived at Atlas we were introduced to a local guide of Said who travelled with us to see a waterfall in the Ourika valley.At the end of our climb and descent, Said seated us in a restaurant arranged a very reasonably priced meal and even assisted with the ordering.Unfortunately, as we had young children everything was delayed on our part - but Said was an Oasis of calm, did not rush us, and instead built up a rapport with the kids who were delighted by the breadth of knowledge Said possesses and were addressing him as Uncle Said by the time we returned.I now have one point of confusion: whether I was impressed more by the breath taking waterfall or the immensely talented Said! Over the past decade my family and I have travelled through Europe, Turkey, UAE and Arabia. I have met plenty of tour guides but have never met anyone as warm, kind and professional as Said. This chap makes the excursion a memorable experience and allows tourists like me to have peace of mind as he takes all the headache, pressures and pit falls of being a foreign country on his shoulders. Anyone travelling to this part of Africa should contact Said as he is not only a gem of a host but a very respectful young man who gives peace of mind, value for money and is an asset not only to SPH Tours but Morocco itself.In terms of rating the Atlas Mountain excursion is 5* - Said is 6* if there is such a rating!Thank you Said."

The very best day though was our daytrip to Imlil and Ouriga Valley with Said. Said is a very friendly, helpful, professional and trustworthy tour guide. He has a lot of knowledge of Morocco, the berber villages and the valleys. Furthermore Said is very patient and we could take our time to explore Ourika Valley and Setti Fatma village. We enjoyed the drive through the valleys from Imlil to Setti Fatma a lot. It seemed less touristy than Ourika Valley. We hope to go back to Morocco someday and we would not hesitate to book Said as our tour guide again."

We started with the mosque and the general history of the city. Later on, he showed us a residential quarter, where many locals live. He explained the differences between Riads and Dars and why the city is built the way it is. The last part of our tour was inside the Souks, assisting us with our first haggling experiences and giving us advice and guidance on how to find our way back to the main square. He also helped me to locate an authentic natural henna tattooist as I have a very severe allergy to the black henna.

We then took a slow walk in to the medina with him explaining the layout of the city and the area we were in as we went. We then spent the next few hours (we finished at 4.15) walking around the medina with him explaining many interesting bits. We stopped for a drink in a lovely riad, he left us for lunch in his favourite snack bar (whilst he went to the mosque), showed us the school he'd been to, the bakery (the baker has been there for 50 years), the hammam, and took us on a winding walk through the bits of the medina where you can still see the items being made by the craftsmen. We'd have been very lost without him.At the end of our tour he helped us get a taxi home (we were very hot, sweaty and dehydrated by then) and when the taxi driver wasn't sure where he was going Abdul came back with us then went home himself.At no point did he take us to his 'favourite' stalls. He was happy to give advice along the way - we subsequently went back and tried some of the bars and restaurants, which all lived up to his comments - and just gave us a good flavour of the medina. The reviews are justified. We felt like we'd seen some good things, learned a lot and got a few good photos along the way. We'd absolutely recommend this tour.Warning: it is a walking tour so take plenty of water (although you'll be able to buy along the way), wear a hat and comfy shoes and grab shade where you can."

We were picked up promptly at our hotel and started the journey on foot around the city and the famous jamaa el fna. I will preface by saying, this is not a shopping tour.. Although Abdul was very accommodating and patient whenever we wanted to look/touch/haggle and purchase something , (even helping us with suggestions and translations), we felt that his whole purpose was showing us the city and teaching us the history he is so proud of. One of the most calm and dignified demeanor ive ever encountered, he walked with us for an entire day, taking us to hidden spots where locals clearly knew and respected him, protecting us (lol) from the sometimes too aggressive market vendors in the market and sharing his knowledge. Abdul, it was a pleasure spending the day with you and we appreciate it that much more given that you spared no effort in showing us everything you could, although it couldn't have been easy doing it in all that heat, for that many hours all while observing the holy Ramadan. As-Sal\u0101mu Alaykum! We will see you again!"

We were a group of 8 and usually I think Youssef would suggest a smaller group; afterwards I can see why! I would say may be up to 4 is ideal and everyone should be fully engaged unlike our group as there is so much to see and so much history. Youssefs representatives Hassan and Noura were excellent however; patient and knowledgeable. We had to split our time into two 3 hour tours as we could not complete everything in one day due to the size of our group. Thankfully Youssef was able to arrange for Noura to come on the second day at short notice. Youssef has always been pleasant and cooperative. All our communication was by email prior to leaving the UK. We paid after the tour.In away we were fortunate to have split the tour between Hassan and Noura. Hassan is from a Berber background and had a lot of knowledge about his people. At the end of the tour he took us to a rooftop berber restaurant which served us totally top drawer food. Likewise Noura was from a Arab background and was able to give us a different perspective on things. She also took us to a great restaurant in the Medina which would have never found by ourselves. Both tours were great and worked out well for our group. Everone was happy with the experience which is difficult to achieve. We saw a lot, took plenty of great pictures, ate some great food, and our guides were excellent."

Right away he asked us what we would like to do so he could plan the best route for us. We decided on going to the medina and exploring the souks and ending our tour in the main square. Abdul is very informative and was happy to answer our many questions. He also pointed out many of the famous buildings of the city such the big towers and hotels . Along the way he gave us many of the local secrets on how to navigate the medina which we found very useful. Abdul told us his favorite stalls in the markets (stall #14 and #98), where the best views are, where to get fresh orange juice, how to get to the main square from a certain point and much more. The snack breaks and the lunch spot were overall pretty good. A plus is that he gives you privacy to dine with your own family during lunch. Abdul was also happy to take pictures of the family and he took us to some of the best photo spots in Medina. Another plus about Abdul is that he is great with kids and accommodating their needs. Abdul made it fun with lots of interesting facts and places to look forward to. He was very patient and was very flexible when one kid was tired. Abdul also brought us to all the shops we wanted: dried fruit and nut, slipper store, jewelry etc., and most importantly he saved time and effort (and stress) but negotiating the price for us. We never felt any pressure to shop or buy. The day went by very quickly and all four of us, including the kids, enjoyed the tour very much. We highly recommend Abdul and Morocco Guided tours!!"

Abdul had really great information regarding the medinas, the squares and the culture. He was extremely relatable and spoke very great english. He showed us some of the people and the places he really considers to be the heart and tradition of Morocco, and I won't reveal those to you but they were exactly what this tour is all about.

Abdul is a real fountain of knowledge and keeps the tour interesting. Our second trip was up into the Altas Mountains, again we loved this trip.

I had read many reviews about Abdul, one of the Tour guides prior to going to Marrakech and was fortunate enough to have been able to book 2 half days. We were interested not only places to see and shopping , but an understanding of Moroccan history and culture . I learned lots, not just facts and figures, but a glimpse at life, in a culture steeped deep in history, beauty , family and spiritual life.I learned lots about the craftsmanship and what to look for in the different things I was shopping for. Abdul's tips and teaching was helpful as my husband and I navigated the souks later on in the week on our own. He will also provide suggestions for a variety of other activities such as cooking schools, and massages. In addition to a walk within the medinas souks, and historical places, we were taken into one of the residential area homes (now a gallery) in the medina which was away from the busyness of the market.It was a wonderful walking tour at a pace that provided ample time for conversation as we explored. If you want to get Abdul as a guide, book ahead of time because he is in demand and you will understand why if you are fortunate enough to get himThanks Abdul. we will treasure the memories of this trip, one of the best I have ever taken.Alice"

This trip with Abdul is not to be missed. He is incredibly informative and answered all of our questions, ranging from cooking to history. We were picked up from our Riad, bang on time, and escorted to the lovely air conditioned car. Our driver for the day was brilliant, we felt very safe with his driving skills. Our first stop was a local market, we had a walk round with Abdul, very interesting to see a market for the locals selling the wares. This is not for the squeamish or vegetarians. It gives you a real insight into life here and we would not have missed it. Then onwards through beautiful countryside, Abdul gives you information all the time. He is extremely amusing with a great sense of humour. We then opted for the shorter walk through the villages, this also is a must, the people are so friendly. If you do this be sure to take writing books, pens etc for the village children. We were impressed with Abdul he had a list of names of some of the children and their ages and their particular requests. Very thoughtful man. We then had lunch with a Berber family and a tea ceremony. Delicious and fun. Then continued on with our walk, wear good shoes. On our way back we passed Richard Bransons hotel Kasbah. As my friend had got engaged there the week before Abdul arranged for us to have a little tour. When I have saved up I am definitely going there for a visit! To sum up, this tour was both informative and amusing. I can not rate Abdul highly enough, we were a bit nervous being on the slightly older side but we need not have worried. Abdul will adapt the tour to suit you. We felt we had a real insight into life in the Berber villages."

Abdul responded promptly and based on the information I gave him about our family, our likes, and interests, he recommended the Hidden Sides and Souks and High Atlas Mountains tours. We enjoyed both immensely! Abdul met us at our riad promptly, and I could immediately tell from his calm but enthusiastic demeanor that we were going to have an enjoyable two days! Abdul expertly explained history, culture, religion, and the beauty of his country. He is a patient man as we asked a million questions! Starting with the obvious we quickly delved into the hidden gems of Marrakech. I'm not going to give away Abdul's secrets, but he took us to places we'd never find on our own. Such neat experiences that I will always remember and cherish. I had told Abdul that I loved all the carpets in our riad and asked if I could buy any in the souks. He looked at a picture of my favorite carpet from our riad and told me he could take me to the store that sold the riad all their carpets. I purchased two carpets and will always remember fondly the experience of learning about and purchasing these treasures every time I look at them in my home. I purchased some other treasures in the souks. I appreciated Abdul's advice. He never told me what to do or not to do, but made subtle suggestions. There was never any pressure to buy from any merchant he introduced me to, but I quickly discovered he introduced me to the merchants with the highest and best quality goods. I also appreciated that he asked us what we were interested in seeing. For example, I didn't have any interest in spices or argan oil, so we skipped that all together. This was our tour based on our interests. I didn't have a lot of information about what we were doing on our second day of touring. However, I learned that Abdul was great at reading people. He figured out our likes and interests pretty quickly, and I trusted that whatever he had planned for us was going to be memorable. Again, I don't want to spoil his secrets, but I will always remember riding camels, trekking in the Atlas Mountains, and learning how to make mint green tea (including the proper way to pour it) in the home of a local family that shared lunch with us. Thank you, Abdul, for memories that I will cherish for my lifetime.I appreciated that Abdul encouraged us to bring pencils, pens, notebooks or trinkets to give to the kids that we would meet along the trail hiking. We brought a bag of pencils and bought some hard candies in the first village along the trail. I loved watching my daughter give pencils and candies to the children. I also loved the smiles on their faces! I can't thank Abdul enough for making his city come to life for us and for sharing it with us! I have had many private guides show me their cities, but Abdul is one of the best we've ever had the pleasure of meeting!"

We did the Marrakesh city/souk tour one day and a day trip to Essaouria another. I would highly recommend both! Abdul helped us navigate the labyrinth that is the souk and took me right to the stalls I needed. He even haggled for me which was was wonderful and saved me stress of having to do so myself. The products that I walked away with were good quality and I didn't have to be fearful of falling for the for the other kind. Abdul went out of his way for us so many times during our stay. He took us to a phone repair shop and waited for a while after my husband's phone fell and the screen went black. He also offered us things of his own in case we didn't get the chance to buy them in the market. Only family does that and that is exactly how we felt. Abdul, we'd love to return the favor one day, so if you are ever in Boston, please look us up!"

We found Abdul, and we are so glad we did. Abdul met us on our very first day and took us on a tour of the Medina. Abdul asked our interests and adapted the tour to suit our party. Abdul is incredibly knowledgeable and gave us a fantastic insight into the history, architecture and culture of Marrakech. Whilst my sister and I loved shopping in the souks (and Abdul gave us some tips how to behave!) it was great to see the locals at work behind the scenes and their general way of life. Most of all Abdul made us feel safe, in what may seem a little daunting in such a busy city if you were on your own, pointing out landmarks and best paths back to our Riad should we get lost. It was the perfect start to our holiday and we happily ventured out confidently on our own the next day. We booked Abdul again for our last day and took a light trek up the Atlas Mountains. What a diverse delight! The views were incredible. Abdul took us to a Berber village where we learnt to make mint tea, had a huge tasty lunch and whiled away the afternoon soaking up the fresh air, sunshine and amazing views. It was the perfect end to a great few days. We loved Marrakech and made all the more enjoyable by such a diverse itinerary and all thanks to Abdul.

Abdul has outstanding English (has a degree in English literature!), very professional prompt email responses & on-time pick-ups for all tours, excellent car service for day tours outside of Marrakech, tailors each experience to your tastes/interests, extremely knowledgeable (we asked A LOT of questions about everything from food culture to geology to economic policy to history, etc\u2026), promotes responsible tourism, takes excellent photos (always nice to get a picture as a couple or family now and then!), will show you the hidden side of the real Morocco, and all at a very reasonable price. Don\u2019t hesitate to book a tour with him now \u2013 we did two day trips (Essaouira & Atlas Mountains) and only wish he had been available for the Marrakech day tour, but we booked too late \u2013 don\u2019t make the same mistake!"

He asked everyone going on the tour what they were interested in and taylored the tour accordingly. During our 5 hour tour we were shown the beautiful Koutuobia Mosque, walked around the winding alleyways of original riads, taken to the tranquil Secret Garden where we stopped for a drink and lunch and then finally shown around the souk. Abdul gave us some very useful haggling tips and took us to see his 90 year old friend who hand sews the most beautiful slippers. Abdul did not tire of our constant questions and we were sad to say goodbye at the end. Thank you for sharing your beautiful city with us Abdul."

He engaged really well with the four teenagers in our group (not an easy job for anyone) and took us to see some really interesting sites and places in Marrakech, but our favorite day was in the Atlas mountains. The views very amazing, and we really enjoyed just hanging out with him and asking him about his culture. The lunch that we had lunch with the Berber family was the best food we had all trip, and just kept coming. I cannot wait to return to Morocco and will be booking Abdul as a guide to Essaouira, and would recommend him to everyone."

He asks you before you start what you are interested in (history, shopping, architecture, etc.) and then designs the walking tour around that. We went to a local bakery which was the highlight for me. To learn about the history of the community, what it was centered around, and to be able to experience a truly authentic place was amazing. You do not feel like a tourist, you feel like a local is inviting you into their culture."

Abdul showed us beautiful sites of Marrakech and provided a lot of extra information. We genuingly enjoyed listening to him and thoroughly loved everything he showed us and spoke about. He speaks both English as French (amongst others) and was also helpfull with giving us an idea of what prices where appropriate for whatever we wanted to eat/buy. Abdul is one of the nicest guides you'll ever meet. He was kind enough to give us an extra hour and answered all our questions patiently."

We hired Abdul to walk us around the souk on our first day for 3 hours.I highly recommend you do this, especially if this is your first time in Marrakech! The souk / the heart of Marrakech is very. very old. It's expansion over the centuries has created this crazy labyrinth where you can easily get lost! You need to know what Derb is really :) Abdul explained us everything. How to walk, how to shop & history. We were so pleased we booked this tour. The next day we already knew what we are doing. We never got lost actually. Even remembered the locations of favourite shops / stands. Abdul is supernice and very knowledgeable! His English is perfect! Book it, you will have so much fun!!!"

I had read about Abdul's tours on another blog, and came upon his tripadvisor website which had raving reviews. A private tour of the High Atlas Mountains for the 7 of us including transport and everything came out to be very reasonable, price-wise! He knew so much about the city of Marrakech and answered all of the questions we had about the country as well. We were very impressed!We embarked on a light trek along the High Atlas Mountains (total took about 1-2h), and stopped at one of the local hotels to have tea with a great view of the mountains. We then continued on and had a traditional berber village lunch up on the mountain with a phenomenal view. Overall, this experience was an incredible day-long trip and I would highly recommend it to anyone! Especially for those who are looking to do something outside of the main city (even if you want to tour places around the city, I'm sure it would be great!), this is a fantastic tour experience!!"

He met us at our hotel, and we plunged head first into some of the more fascinating points about the history of the city. Our tour of the Medina was thoughtfully planned -- we entered by means of a small back street and not through a main artery. We visited a variety of sites, both old and new. He provided some fascinating context about the \"urban planning\" and organization of the Medina. We visited several merchants, both small and large. A late lunch at a street side vendor (apparently a friend of Abdul's) was on par with a dinner at a luxury hotel featuring a Michelin-rated chef. And we ended the day with an absolutely stunning stroll through the main plaza, the Jemma El Fnaa, where stalls, spices, snake handlers, locals, and tourists were all bathed in the gorgeous light of the setting sun. It was a really magical way to end the day. Highly recommended."

We tried to get him for an additional day, but he was unavailable. He is extremely knowledgeable about history and religion and tactful, but honest, in discussing Muslim interactions with the west. I was particularly touched when he described his own feelings about the day Baghdad fell, as a Muslim, even though he was no fan of Saddam Hussein. A big reason for travel is to have your horizons expanded and your views challenged and stretched. Abdul was marvelous for that. Abdul was also the only guide we had in Morocco that did not direct us to a tourist trap restaurant and the only guide that joined us in eating lunch. As a result, we had our favorite meal in Morocco with him. We mentioned that we were adventurous eaters and would like to try something unusual. He asked us if we would like to try sheep's head? We said yes and he took us to an alley off the main square where they cook sheep and showed us the pit they are roasted in, tangia pots where another type of cooking takes place, and also where the sheep heads are cooked. We then had a meal that involved beef cooked in tangia pots, roasted lamb from the pit and sheep's head. It was fantastic. I really felt Abdul was there for us and did not have a side agenda to direct us into various stalls and restaurants where he would earn an extra commission, something that we experienced with every other guide we had in Morocco. In fact, he stayed with us longer than we had contracted with him for, as there were some things he wanted us to see. I recommend Abdul without reservation and wish we could have had an extra day with him."

We took the tour on a Saturday and we're lucky about to be able to stop at a weekly market in a town on the foot hills of the mountain - an experience to say the least!We carried on into the mountains and visited one of the famous Kasbahs which was really cool. After we had a gentle trek to a Berber village where we stopped to enjoy lunch with a local Berber family - a true experience to be hosted in a local family home and dine on some exceptional food. Abdul is a very considerate guide, making sure to give us a great experience while also being very sensitive to the local Berber people (he brought gifts with him which we have to children we met along our trek!)After a long and leisurely lunch we made our way back towards Marrakech, with Abdul keeping us entertained with his throws of the area and pointing out all the sights along the way.All in this was an exceptional day, we loved it and would put us at the top of a 'must do' list for anyone visiting the area.

I was on my own and found his company very enjoyable. As we wandered through the souks Abdul pointed out landmarks so that I could find my way around alone, and at no stage was there any pressure to visit a friend's shop. He also shared his knowledge of the history and local customs of the area, and showed me interesting things I would have missed on my own (a school and a bakery etc). I paid more for my tour than some colleagues who found a guide themselves but they did not enjoy their tour as much as I did. When I went back to the medina later, I was able to tell them things that their guide had not told them, and find our way back in the souks because of the landmarks Abdul had noted. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for. I can't speak highly enough of him. Abdul, I wish you well, my friend."

Adbul adjusted to us though and without anything having to be said, he figured out how to make us get the most out of our tour. He was brilliant. Our tour started at our hotel and before long, we were in the Medina and then into the souks where we visited Dar Cherifa and Ben Youssef Madrasa before having our own rooftop table set up for us to enjoy some street food. We saw locals schools, bakeries, mosques and even bumped into Abdul's family along the way. The tour was EXACTLY what we were looking for. We would never have seen any of the above without Abdul - a local taking round his city. After 6 hours, we even felt brave enough to head back into the souks on our own at night...and we didn't get lost. Thank you."

Even before we met things got off to a good start as he asked me what I was interested in and what I'd like to see and my tour was custom made. We met in a central location as my hotel wasn't in the centre of Marrakech. He had sent me directions, a photo of the meeting point and a picture of himself and he arrived promptly.The day was wonderful from start to finish. It was evident that he had put a lot of thought into planning the day but at the same time made it appear spontaneous and fun. Abdul provided a real insiders guide to Marrakech we saw many of the famous sights and visited the souks but the best thing was exploring the hidden side of the city, this included walking through charming, little alleyways, visiting a local bakery and even seeing his former school. We met some of the local craftsmen and even enjoyed some musical entertainment. His tour was fun and very entertaining and he really brought the city to life and made it very memorable.Abdul is a very knowledgeable guide, focused on the things that interested me and was able to answer all my questions. He was also very thoughtful as he build in comfort breaks for refreshments and toilet stops.The tour was scheduled to finish at 3.30pm but was extended, at no extra cost, by about 30 - 45 minutes. During the tour we discussed my love of mint tea and afterwards he sent me a PDF about how to make it.The tour was a fabulous introduction to Marrakech and I would highly recommend booking a full day tour. Thanks Abdul for an unforgettable day."

I don\u2019t think this trip would have been the same without this tour so yes, I strongly recommend this service. One other great thing about Abdul is his eye for photography.

There were four of us and Mum and Dad are in the 70s and have the odd joint issue so I had asked for a slow paced tour. We had a wonderful day wandering through the historical sites of marrakech and exploring parts we had not been to on our previous trip. Abdulrazak was a fount of knowledge and very considerate. We saw some amazing things and had a few stops for refreshments. We were out until about 2000 but although tired none of us were exhausted and the day went like a dream. Abdul went to pray twice during the day while we had tea which made for a nice break. We had some great conversations and it was wonderful to hear his ideas and thoughts on several topics. I would not hesitate to recommend his services and we are very grateful to him.Thanks Abdul"

Thanks to his lifetime experience with this magical city he showd us not only the sights described in books, but also let us feel the city's atmosphere, showed how people live here, there was not question which he would not answer in a very interesting way-my 12 year old daughter and her friend of the same age were not bored at all and today after our return back home they still remember many details and are thrilled with the trip. Abdul knew how short of time we were and so he even arranged that a seller of nice antique teapots met us on our way back to our Riad with 5 teapots to choose from. Truly unforgettable was the trip to Atlas mountains, where Abdul arranged donkeys for our kids to take them up the hill to the Berber home, where we had the best meal of our stay, true Morrocan food which we could enjoy from the terrace having view of beautiful valley and high mountains. Abdul together with the Berber host arranged a typical local dress for our dauhters and had them experience preparation of tea in Morrocan way dressed as Morrocan ladies. It was really a perfect day!!!!."

He is such a lovely man, we were quite a large group but he immediately made everyone feel at ease. He is also very knowledable and passionate about Marrakesh and you feel he knows so much about the City he would be able to tailor his tour to whatever you are interested in. He was also funny and made us laugh, telling my mum she was the queen which made us all laugh. He was also brilliant in the souks - took us to some genuine artisans and even bartered for us to get us some amazing quality goods for great prices, this really helped us as the enormity of the souks is quite overwhelming and we would have had no idea where to start without him. There was also some really nice touches - he bought lovely hot bread, chick peas with cumin and even gave us a bottle of his special olive oil which had been freshly pressed and he didn't even ask for any money for this - really beyond what you would get on a standard tour. You can't fail by booking a tour with Abdul and you will miss out if you don't."

Abdul really is an insider in the city - he grew up in the Medina so knows everyone from the baker to the hammam furnace man. All of who we got to meet :).

Before my arrival in Marrakech he was highly responsive and polite over email, asking what I wanted to see in the city so he could customize our tour. From the moment he picked my friend and me up at our hotel, he was absolutely charming and a veritable fountain of knowledge about the city. His pride in Marrakech is palpable and contagious, and we learned so much from him about this fascinating, friendly, unique place. Besides his boundless knowledge about the city's history and character, Abdul is also the ultimate guide if you're a shopper, as my friend and I are. Abdul took us to the wholesalers in the souks and helped us find literally the best of everything, from argan oil to light fixtures to handmade leather poufs. He also took us to a shoemaker who's well over 90 years old and has been making the best handmade slippers in the city for decades, as well as a tailor who makes exquisite linen clothing that you won't find anywhere else. Abdul helped us negotiate prices everywhere we went and, always the consummate gentleman, even insisted on carrying our bags.Having had such a wonderful day with him on Saturday, we hired Abdul again on Sunday for a late-afternoon trip to Jemaa el Fna (the city's sprawling main square) to watch the famous sunset. He took us to his favorite spice shop so we could buy saffron and then for tea at a spot with a lovely rooftop terrace before he took us to the best vantage point from which to watch the sun go down. When he walked us back to our hotel we were sad to say goodbye to him after he gave us such an amazing insider's view of Marrakech.As a travel writer, I constantly travel all over the world and have met many guides, and Abdul is the absolute best you will find. There is a no question he can't answer, and more importantly, he is an absolutely lovely man who goes out of his way to show and teach you everything he can about the city that he so clearly loves. I consider him a true friend and cannot wait to explore Marrakech again with him when I'm lucky enough to return."

We engaged Abdul and Marrakech Guide Day tours for three days - the full-day tour of the medina, the High Atlas Mountains tour, and the tour of Essaouira. I wish I could give Abdul 10 stars instead of 5, as his guidance these three days has shown us a part of Morocco we would have never found on our own.The tour of the medina was essential for getting us oriented to this maze-like city. Abdul explained how the addresses within the medina work and gave us detailed and helpfully repetitive tips such that we would be able to find our way back to our riad when we ventured out on our own. You will see so many sites on this tour that you would never find on your own. For example, we visited a baker in his traditional bakery and a man who stokes the fire for a hammam. Abdul grew up in the city, so there were constantly people greeting him and shaking his had, which was really special. One of the things that caught my eye on their website is the information about responsible tourism. While in the city, Abdul took us to visit a co-op of disabled women who make beautiful linens and crafts. Most guides don't go there, as there is not a commission for the guide. Abdul helped us barter when we wanted to shop, but only took us to places we wanted to see. The tours were totally planned around our interests.I can't stress enough how the tour of Marrakech shaped our vacation. The city is maze-like and a little intimidating for this South Carolina girl due to the language barrier. Having Abdul guide us allowed us to see more than we would have ever seen, without fumbling around for the map. Again, we packed in more sites in one day than we would have found in a week on our own.Next we took the High Atlas Mountains tour. We chose to have lunch with a local Berber family, which was incredible. They were such lovely hosts, and Abdul taught our daughter how to make the traditional tea service. The highlight of the trip for me was greeting the local children and giving them small gifts like pencils and pens. They were absolutely precious. The views in the mountains are stunning, and you feel like you are a million miles away from the city. It was super relaxing after the exciting hustle and bustle of Marrakech.Our final trip was to the fishing village of Essaouira. This is a beautiful coastal fishing town. We toured the buildings and saw incredible sea views. Abdul gave us the option of eating in a restaurant OR having our driver go to a seafood market and buying fresh seafood, which would then be prepared especially for us. We chose that option, and it was an amazing meal. I dream about the shrimp dish -- it was sooooo good! At the end of the day, Abdul treated us to a drink at a beautiful seaside cafe, which really touched us. He was such a pleasant person to spend three days with!!I cannot say enough good things about this tour company or about Abdul. He was truly our guide in all matters. He showed us the sites and was our navigator, but also helped us with any questions we had about what was considered polite behavior vs. \"no-nos\" in his culture, which was something that was extremely important to me. I left with an amazingly positive view of the Moroccan people, and I wanted them to think we'll of us, too. The communication prior to our visit was excellent, and Abdul completely arranges the trip based on your needs. Since we had him for three days, he got to know us and knew we always wanted the most traditional experience, not McDonalds or the mall (both of which they have in Marrakech, if that is your preference!). For example, my hubbie has a short window of time between bathroom breaks, and Abdul always made sure that we had a clean restroom throughout the day. This may seem like a little thing, but it is a major problem if you are uncomfortable on a vacation.Again, my highest, highest recommendation to Abdul and his company. He \"made\" our trip to Morocco!"

I'd been told stories of inflated prices and being ripped off so I wanted someone I could trust. Abdul stood out to me because of the many postive things people had to say so I decided to take the plunge and check out his website, then when I was completely happy, I contacted him for availabiliy and prices. Abdul was very professional on email and in person. He was prompt when arriving to meet me at my hotel, welcoming and warm.He told to me the routes we would be taking to the souk and pointed out landmarks along the way and explaining history of Marrakech as we walked. He asked me what I wanted to buy/look at and took me to the best places to shop for these items. Abdul was patient and happy for me to stop at stalls if I wanted to. He negotiated prices for me but only at the stalls he took me to, not at the random places I wanted to stop at, so be prepard to haggle if you stop for yourself. Overall I throughly enjoyed my shopping experience and I felt safe and less hassled walking with Abdul. He carried my bags during the trip and walked me back to my hotel at the end of the tour. I couldn't have asked for a better guide and I've recommended him to a few colleagues who are travelling to Marrakech next week."

All organised by email prior to arrival with a program completely tailored to our wishes, Abdul arrived punctually at our hotel with a spotless van. With excellent English and a good sense of humour. So Knowledgeable he answered all our questions on all aspects of Moroccan life and culture. His kind and warm personality was evidenced by him handing charity and food to the less fortunate in the local market and sweets for the children in the villages. (We toured the high Atlas Mountains and Berbere villages as well as the Souk).In the markets he asked us what we were interested in buying and assisted us, there was no random stops to see items in which we had no interest. He also directed us to dinner at a local restaurant away from the touristy traps.After spending 11 hours together, we ended more knowledgeable and had a greater understanding of the soul of Morocco. It was a pleasure having him as our guide and I highly recommend him."

We booked the tour for our first full day in Morocco and never visiting before we were unsure of what to expect. Abdul quickly put us at ease! He met us at our resort where we then walked to the Old City. This was great because we were then able to find our own way to and from later in the week. He did a fantastic job showing us the city, explaining the culture, and answering all our questions. We stopped at a few places to eat that were amazing and after going through the souks we were comfortable enough to go back and explore more on our own. He even helped us track down our missing luggage and arranged a car to pick us up to take us to and from the airport to retrieve our luggage. Even after our trip he followed through in e-mailing us Moroccan recipes to try at home. Abdul really went above and beyond and you can tell how much he loves the City of Marrakech and his culture. HIghly recommend!"

We thought that we should start out with a tour of the Medina with a local guide.We checked on Internet and we found the profile of Adbul Aissaoui of Marrakech Guided Tours. We booked him for a full day tour and it was a very wise decision. Adbul took us at a slow pace through some of the well-known and other less well-known parts of the Medina. But above all he gave us important insights about the history, the economy, the architecture and the social life of the city. He was also very useful with suggestions about things we would do on our own (hammams, list of other places to visit). We absolutely recommend him. Our visit to Marrakech acquired a deeper meaning after spending a day with Adbul."

Abdul is a wonderful guide whose first concern is the comforts of his guests, and is a great person to talk to. The first time I visited in April of 2015, the weather was beautiful and we had a relaxing stroll through the city. Abdul gave us interesting historical information about Essaouira, and took us to some local artisanal shops. When I visited in October of 2015 it was absolutely torrentially raining, but we still had a great time. Abdul made us feel comfortable and took care of everything that was needed to make this day trip a great experience. He also took us to a small local restaurant where we had fish for lunch, and my dad said it was the best food he had in a week in Morocco. Highly recommended!"

He was ready to answer any questions whether it was about the Call to Prayer, Moroccan marriage traditions, or current Moroccan politics. After the trip, Abdul took the time to take us through the square and point out all of the good food stalls, which I proceeded to sample the rest of the trip. Marrakech can be a bit overwhelming for a newcomer. A great way to ease into the city and Morocco in general is to book a day with Abdul. Ryan"

We were a group of 5 women and we hired Abdul because we wanted to learn about the history of these two beautiful places whilst feeling secure with someone who knew the souks and backroads. Abdul wove the history of Marrakech into our wonderful trip and told us about architecture and founding kings and the Morroccan way of life. He was a very thoughtful guide and really undsertood our needs as a group and found us some lovely little resturants along the way. In Essouira, we heard about the history of the town, the Mellah, the beautiful old port and he gracefully answered all our questions about every aspect of history and Morrocan life. He took us to meet a shepard with goats in trees, a womens' co-operative (which we loved) and we felt safe, happy and looked after at all times. His driver, Uniss, drove us with care and made little stops as often as we wanted. We have never hired a guide before and we now realise how much we have missed that cannot be gleamed from guide books. By the end of our long but action packed weekend we were firmly under the spell of Marrakech and a little under the spell of our wonderful guide Abdul. It was worth every penny."

He would deliver information with sycg great thoughtfulness and at a tempo that was easy to absorb.

We booked two tours with Abdul (the Marrakech/Souks and the Essaouira Day tours). I HIGHLY recommend that Abdul introduce you to this enchanting city on your first full day. Abdul walked us through the old city, residential quarters, souks, medina, mosques, and everywhere in between while providing a layered history lesson about former ruling empires. Abdul tailored the tour to focus on our interests in architecture and history. Our day with Abdul truly prepared us for the week in Morocco. There's no way a visitor can truly appreciate the gems that Marrakech has to offer without a knowledgeable guide like Abdul to set the backdrop.Abdul and a driver escorted us to Essaouira for our second tour. The drive was a short 2.5 hr drive west of the city. This was a very laid back day with no set itinerary. We arrived at the GORGEOUS port by late morning. We were able to choose the best catches of the morning from local fishermen. We then took our fish to a type of \"restaurant\" where they grilled the seafood for us. This may have been the BEST MEAL we've had our entire trip. Abdul is simply the best guide we've ever had. He answered all of our questions and made sure we were prepared for the week of \"haggling\" in the souks. We also appreciated his willingness to take us to local eateries that were off the beaten path. These gems turned out to be the best food we'd eaten during our stay. Abdul is kind, patient, knowledgeable, and funny. He unlocked the Magic of the city for us. I can't recommend him enough.

I emailed him before we arrived for advice and decided to book a full day tour (Hidden Sides) on our first day and another half day tour the following morning to explore the Souks. We enjoyed both days so much. We learned so many interesting facts about Marrakech, met so many interesting local people and Abdul treated us as friends, so much so that we missed him for the rest of the holiday! We did another tour to the desert which was fantastic but would have been so much better if Abdul were with us!We were happy to let Abdul show us around without a particular agenda but he is very quick to pick up on the types of things that you enjoy and tailors the trip according to your tastes. We saw so much beautiful architecture and Abdul was so knowledgeable about the history of the place, the culture and he makes it seem so easy to navigate when you are with him! He took us to a fantastic place to eat which we never would have ventured to if we were alone and this I think is the best thing about taking a tour with Abdul. Marrakech is a wonderful place, but it can also be slightly overwhelming and having someone so calm and knowledgeable by your side immediately makes you feel at ease so that you can relax and experience things that you may not allow yourself to if you were alone. We met a local baker, the man that lights the fires for the Hammam who sang for us and many tradesmen and skilled workers that Abdul thought we would be interested in meeting. When he takes you to meet these people there is no pressure to buy anything from them or to give them money (although we chose to), it is all for the experience and this was the part of the tours that we loved the most, so interesting and such good memories to take away!On the souks tour I assured Abdul that I was skilled at bartering and did not need his help so he stood a short distance away pretending to look the other way while a merchant wrapped scarves around my head and I tried to barter with him. Eventually I just heard a calm voice say \"Sam, would you like some help?\". I immediately accepted and he gave the merchant a telling off and let me barted again. I was really pleased with the deal I got but then Abdul spoke to him again and he gave me some more change so Abdul clearly wasn't pleased with the deal that I got! After that Abdul gave me a good talking to about how the merchants are just trying to earn a living to feed their families but that they can sometimes be very pushy and that I should not be forced into buying something that I did not want or paying more than I expect to pay for something. From then on he kindly did all my bartering for me but after he left us his talk still had an effect on me and I would find myself walking away after either buying something or deciding not to, saying to my husband, \"I think Abdul would have been proud of me then!\"He was so respectful, polite, warm, friendly and protective of us and went out of his way each day to make us happy. When I visit Marrakeck again I will definitely book Abdul for his knowledge and company and I will recommend him to friends as I am recommending him to you now. Book a trip with him, it will make your holiday."

We did two tours with Abdul, the first was a half-day tour that combined \"hidden\" Marrakech with some major sites and a tour of the souks. On this tour we learned a lot of history and really got a sense of how Marrakech is laid out as well as a sense for the daily lives of the people who live there. Abdul answered dozens of our questions about everything. He was very helpful in giving us acceptable ranges of prices for items in the souk where both buyer and seller would have an acceptable deal. His tours are completely customized as to what you what you want to do, but as he gets to know you, he will make sure to add on things he knows you should not miss. Best of all, he is really your personal guide, there were no attempts to make you go anywhere and/or visit merchants/restaurants he has a relationship with. My parents took a guided tour organized via our resort and wound up listening to an Argan oil presentation for 40 minutes; this will not happen with Abdul.Our second tour was a day trip to Essaouira from Marrakech with my parents and our kids. The van we had was brand new with air conditioning that worked! (the only time that happened during our trip) We had a wonderful walk around the city with lots of insight from Abdul. Once again he adapted our tour to allow us to go off and do what we wanted (art shopping for us, ice cream for the kids). My kids especially enjoyed a stop along the way where shepards put a flock of goats in a beautiful Argan tree!To top all of this off, it was Ramadan so Abdul was unable to eat or drink during our tours which made it all the more remarkable how patient and accommodating he was."

He complied with our requests and filled in with just the right experiences to make it a lovely tour. We were concerned about it being Ramadan and it wasn't an issue at all.

Both of these tours I would highly recommend, we got a great feel for the city, the people who live and work within; including the heritage of Marrakech. He is very knowledgeable of the city as he has lived and worked there all his life so is very keen on sharing his stories, he showed us a local Souk eatery which did not look much from the outside and we were a little nervous about eating there as you hear all the horror stories of people getting upset stomachs, yet we enjoyed this experience greatly and didn't suffer the next day either which was a bonus! Not being used to the negotiation in the Souk Abdul used his experience to recommend highly quality items, even helping haggle for the best price.We particularly enjoyed our second day, the tour of the mountain's taking a nice few hours walking through the villages themselves, which a large tour group would not be able to do; from doing this we got a over powering feel for how the Berber people live and work everyday. The day finished off by having a meal with a local family and a tea ceremony. Abdul also is a great photographer, knowing great spots and letting us take any opportunity we wanted to take pictures and taking a few snaps for us. Overall a very knowledgeable and interesting two days and highly recommend."

I walk daily( never trekked) and my sister is not even a walker as such..and she was rather anxious at the thought of it but have no fear we really enjoyed it and its at you're own pace, walking through Berber villages we, had an opportunity to stop at a local Berber house for a comfort stop and the kettle was on for a cuppa!!Abdul nominated me to assist with tea making ceremony.. I'm a mug and tea bag girl so it was somewhat of a challenge but we had a good laugh.. and amazing the tea was actually drinkable. We arrived at Toubkal Kasbah in time for lunch on the terrace.. views breathtaking overlooking snow capped Mount Toubkal and the valley below..it was a lovely relaxing 2 hours, wishing we could have stayed there longer, I hope to return to Toubkal Lodge and do some more trekking in high atlas soon( I've got the trekking bug!!) we then headed down to Imlil 20 minutes down a very uneven path and certainly not for those with any kind of walking difficulties.( mules are available for hire)Both tours were superb, Abdul is such a really nice laid back type of a guy and we just loved his dry sense of humour..Inshallah we will return to Marrakech sometime soon.. We would certainly recommend Abdul.. He is the perfect guide.... Simply the Best!!!"

We tried to book Abdul for the hidden sides tour for 1 day and a second day in the high atlas but there was a slight mix up so he made alternative arrangements for us.However, the hidden sides tour with Khalid was great. If you cannot get Abdul to show you around ask him to arrange for his friend Khalid to take you instead as he was very friendly, humble, knowledgeable and humorous. He not only showed us places of historic and religious interest, but also gave us an insight into the everyday working life of the ordinary Marrakshi, taking us to meet craftsmen making things from metal, wood and even the man who stokes the furnace of a Hamman and cooks the Tanjia for anyone who will pay a small fee at the same time! We felt a part of the city for a short time rather than confused tourists wandering around getting lost! We cannot thank Khalid enough.Now, back to Abdul. Having made alternative arrangements the first day we did not expect to meet him at our Riad the following morning but there he was to explain he would see us later during our trip to the Atlas Mountains. The driver was friendly, scenery spectacular and the Berber guide who took us on a trek was excellent. All this had been arranged by Abdul and we later met him properly at a Berber house for a wonderful meal and mint tea. He was a very interesting person with excellent English,great knowledge of his country and a funny guy as well! Even though he was not with us the whole two days he left a great impression on us and we would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone who wants a personal tour as he makes it all go so smoothly.

There was one of about 90 minutes that didn't involve so much uphill climbing but instead took you around some waterfalls. We opted for the one that was about 2 hours and took you up to a Berber village higher up the mountain before coming back down to the Berber house where we had lunch. Warning...don't book a meal for when you get back that night , you won't need it !. After the Tea Ceremony we had a huge salad, supplied with lots of break and Olive Oil. Following this we had a delicious Lamb Tagine. By then I was full, bit then another Tagind of Chicken and Cous Cous arrives. Finally fresh Fruit for dessert if you can manage it.After the meal it is about 20 minutes back to the car and 1 hour drive back to Marrakech.Overall best day of our trip to Marrakech.

In total we walked around 10 miles (calculated by my iPhone steps) so it's not for the feint hearted, but I'm sure he'd accommodate everyone's needs and abilities (we are an early-30s couple).His English is exceptional, and he showed around the whole medina, orienting us without being too forceful; 'you remember this?', 'look for this sign', etc, all things we used throughout our stay. We went to Dar Cherifa, a beautiful converted riad, a fully working community bakery where we sampled some homemade bread (we loved this bit - very rustic) and we also went to Ben Youssef Madrasa, an old Islamic college. We had to pay a very small fee for the latter but it is well worth seeing. He helped us haggle and orient ourselves in the souks, and recommended some very good stalls in the night market on Jamma el Fna. I cannot begin to describe in a review how useful and pleasant our experience was.

Abdul brought cookies and notebooks for the children, which were greatly appreciated, and added to the experience in meeting and interacting with the children.

As it was our first time in Morocco, we wanted to utilize a tour guide to provide optimal usage of our time and to have a sense of security, being all females. I chose Abdul based on his high reviews in Trip Advisor. Several reviewers mentioned that would customize his tours based on individual needs. This was important to me. Abdul not only met our needs but he went above and beyond. As our teenage girls would say to him, \" You've Abdul yourself!\" During our week, we visited Essaouria, the souks in the Medina and the Atlas Mountains ( bring proper footwear!) The highlight of our trip for sure was learning about the Berber way of life in the Atlas Mountains. Abdul bought pens and coloring books for our daughters to hand out to the Berber children. The look of delight on their little faces were so precious! We later enjoyed a delicious traditional lunch on the rooftop of Berber home. Our daughters learned to make mint tea and was given Moroccan outfits to wear. Great weather, views, food and company, a perfect day!  At the end of our week, we felt we made a friend and Abdul left a lasting impression on our girls. He is very proud of what he does and genuinely wants you to have a great vacation. He's also a walking encyclopedia of Morocco so you will also learn so much about the beautiful culture of Morocco. Don't hesitate to book with Abdul. You will not regret it!"

My wife and I were so impressed by others' reviews that we booked three days of tours (Souks, Marrakech Hidden Sights, and Essouiara) with Abdul. We told him exactly what we wanted to see and do, and that is exactly what we got. Not only did we see and do exactly what we asked for, our conversations with Abdul gave us a great understanding of Morocco, including its history, people, customs, and religion. During the Souks tour, we told Abdul what we were looking for and he took us to very high quality craftsmen. He bartered for us, and the money he saved us more than covered the cost of the tour. The same thing happened during the Hidden Sights tour the next day. My wife is an artist and I am a photographer, so he took us to the stalls and gardens that were perfect for us.Adbul's English is excellent. He is well-educated, knowledgable, and truly interested in making each visitor's experience memorable."

We were taken through many back alleyways to different parts of the souks, spent time with the local baker and also the Hamman fire stoker for mint tea and a music interlude. Met several local craftsman and visited the Ben Youseef Madrasa. Abdul clearly enjoys sharing his knowledge and answers all questions freely and openly often dispelling westernized views of Islam and the Arab world. The walking tour introduces you to the medina and its surrounding area, allows you to get your bearing and feel less intimated when out alone. A very enjoyable way to while away a few hours."

I loved it - in fact I believe I could easily live there and certainly intend to return! Abdul showed us the sights and informed us of the history as we wondered around soaking up the atmosphere.

The tour was conducted at a leisurely-paced walk which was nice since we were toting along a child. He suggested several stops to give us some insight into local life, but these were always proposed as optional and there was never any pressure applied to visit them. If there were additional costs involved, such at the museums, Abdul was very upfront about these costs and again everything was completely optional. There were conveniently timed and adequate bathroom facilities throughout the tour, which lasted a total of about 3 1/2 hours. We wanted to see the souks, but not waste too much of our time with Abdul there. He walked us through a few sections, but more importantly gave us some orientation so we could return again later on our own time.

We organised a full day city tour with Abdul on our first day in Marrakech, on the first day of the new year (1 Jan 2015). This turned out to be a most enjoyable way to start the new year, and gave us an excellent orientation to the Marrakech medina. Abdul began by asking us what we wanted to get out of the tour, and after reading a number of reviews on TripAdvisor, we wanted to focus on the 'real' Marrakech, behind the scenes, along with a focus on art, architecture and history. Abdul collected us from our Riad on time and we spent the day exploring the medina and souks. His English was excellent, as was his historical and local knowledge. One thing that we particularly valued was that we had just come from Granada and visiting the Alhambra, and Abdul helped us to better understand the impact and links of moorish art and history between Granada and Morocco. The tour took a relaxed pace, and overall we found Abdul's relaxed demeanour reassuring in the hustle and bustle of the medina. (We adopted his relaxed approach for the rest of our stay, helping make this a fabulous holiday). We took plenty of stops for photos, browsing, discussing and food as needed (he took us to a delightful little place for local, selling delicious broadbean soup for lunch - one of my favourite meals of our trip). We found Abdul very trustworthy and honest and if we had needed someone to help guide us on a shopping trip, he would have been perfect. Be sure to book home well in advance."

I briefed Abdul on what we wanted to see before we met as I was keen to avoid the 'hard sell' that seems to follow you around the city. He took good note of this and we had a good mix of day to day life - local markets where people shop for fruit, vegetables and meat etc. along with history culture and even a brief glimpse of a funeral cortege(!). Abdul was on time and waiting for us on the day, and took excellent care of us, we walked steadily around the city, and enjoyed an excellent lunch at a place packed out with locals.As an introduction to a city and culture quite different to what I am used to I can't fault the day we had. It gave us the confidence to strike out on our own and explore much deeper into the city than I would have previously imagined."

We booked 2 full day tours with him in advance for a party of 10 adults: one was the Hidden sides tour and the other a trip to the Atlas mountains to have lunch with a Berber family. On both days Abdul met us promptly at our riad and was friendly accommodating and very knowledgeable throughout. On the hidden sides tour he took us to some fascinating and lesser known sights of the city as well as the \"must see\" areas. We had an excellent lunch on a terrace of a restaurant called \"Kui-ZIn\" which I would also highly recommend- the food, service, cleanliness and prices would be hard to beat. On the Atlas mountain tour Abdul arranged a very nice mini bus for us all with a careful driver who took us up a mountain pass into the national park. We were delighted to meet a Berber family there who made us extremely welcome and cooked an amazing 4 course lunch for us. We also had great fun joining in traditional tea ceremony and meeting the local children. Overall we had a memorable weekend and thoroughly enjoyed Abdul's company along the way. We learned a lot about the history of Morocco and Islam and had some interesting discussions along the way. He made our trip effortless and took care of all the little things like tipping( if we wanted to take photos), negotiating the public toilets etc as well as advising us on local customs etc He is a genuine person and did not try to sell us anything or pressurise us into doing anythingThank you very much Abdul! We wish you well in the future and will contact you againLindsey"

I'm not one for wringing long reviews but I can only say that a guided tour of Marrakech is easily the most essential part of any trip to the city.We booked a half day tour of the Souks in the Medina as we wanted to do some serious shopping and to learn the intricacies of craftsmen and the market.Abdul was prompt, arriving at our Riad and to begin with spent some time just chatting to ask what we thought we were looking for. Quickly he geared the tour to exactly what we liked and took us into the souks, explaining how they work, how the developed and then looking at each craft/trade in turn. What became apparent is that he knows a lot of people in the media, which is a good sign and that he has a great sense of humour!. Abdul took us through how to judge quality and price, including haggling, but more that just lecturing he encouraged us to assess for ourselves how to spot cheap tourist products and the real local high quality products. What was good to see is that he picked up items for his family on the way round which steered us to the types of things that we would like.Anyway, I'm waffling, the highlights of the tour are: - Visiting a 90 year old shoe maker and looking at his handmade slippers. - Picking our a second hand Moroccan tea pot in a genuine tea pot shop. - Drinking mint tea from a seller which had been operating in the souks for hundreds of years. - The glass seller who my wife thought was lovely - Seeing the places where the craftsmen work rather than the touristy market stalls around the Jemaa  - Sitting and chatting with Abdul over good coffee, where his natural friendliness, knowledge and humour kept us captivated Marrakech is a bit like and iceberg, you only see 10%, but with a guide like Abdul you get to see and understand the other 90!"

If it's your first time to Marrakesh then there's no better way to explore the old Medina then with a private guided tour with Abdul!The Souk can be quite daunting with the numerous alleyways and passages leading off the main road - Abdul was kind enough to show us how to navigate the Souk, the landmarks to watch out for and also how to find our Riad again! After that we didn't need a map any more!There is so much heritage and culture in the old medina that you really need someone who knows the history, architecture and the people in order to fully experience Marrakesh! If you end up on one of those large guided tours, then you are just shepherd from place to place and only get to see Marrakesh from the outside.Abdul made the tour personal, he took us to all the nooks and crannies of Marrakesh, places that you would never experience on a big tour!We broke bread with a local community baker, we had tea with the person who heats up the community hammam.Abdul was fantastic! He is very knowledgeable, professional, kind and willing to answer all our questions.We've been on numerous private tours around the world, and were amazed at how much he knew about the history of Marrakesh. There's not an area on the walk around the town where he wasn't pointing out a historical fact or figure!What we really appreciated was how much Marrakesh and the Moroccan culture meant to Abdul. His passion for his work really shines through!Abdul also knows all the good places to eat in Marrakesh and took us to Chez Lamine for lunch, we enjoyed an excellent Tangia and Mechoui, so much so that we went back again for our final meal in the city.We actually went overtime by half an hour but he didn't mind at all... now I call that dedication. It was such a shame we were too late to book him for his other tours as I'm sure we would have enjoyed his company at Essaouira or even the Imlil Valleys (which we did on his recommendation!)We left the tour fully enriched with Moroccan culture and also happy that we had made a new friend."

To cap it off we ended up in the Souks and took in the vibrance and colour of the main square.

From the moment I arrived in the Medina, the walled city, of Marrakech, Morocco I encountered a world unlike any I had ever seen. To the uninitiated it seems at first an incomprehensible warren of narrow walkways and narrower alleyways, with occasional streets wide enough for automobiles. It is a world of deeply hidden interiors, lived enclosed, all of which presents as a mystery to the traveler. Thankfully my husband and I and another couple had the wisdom to engage a guide and we spent our first full day in the Medina exploring the city with Abdul Aissaoui of Marrakech Guided Tours (contactmarrakechguidedtours@gmail.com). With him, a native of Marrakech, we soon began to see order, the warren of streets became neighborhoods, we discovered amazing and beautiful worlds behind inauspicious and locked doors, we heard stories of the city's almost 1000 year old history, we saw the snake charmers and the monkeys and the myriad of activities in the central square, we paused for coffee in an ancient arched and tiled inner courtyard, we had a delicious lunch of lamb roasted until tender in a giant clay pot buried in the ground, varieties of olives, marinated, spicy and mild, sour pickles, rounds of fresh warm bread and pots of beef, olive oil, garlic and rosemary cooked for hours in the steam used to heat the hamams, we learned about the Koutoubia Mosque and heard the call to prayer from its magnificent minaret, walked deep into the souks and saw how the vendors were sorted by type of merchandise offered, watched the end of day rug auction, saw the food vendors, marveled at the many varieties of olives, the mounds of dates, and the many aromas of the spice vendors, and we timidly forayed into the world of bargaining for purchases. By the end of our day together we could begin to pick out landmarks and had a general idea of how to wend out way back to our hotel. Abdul loves his city, he knows all of its hidden secrets and he delights in their revealing. He patiently and thoroughly answered our many questions, deftly maneuvered us in and out of the city's many byways, and laughed with us as we gingerly made our first attempts at bargaining. While he showed us he taught us and he opened our eyes to the many facets of the Medina and by the end of the day we had a vastly enlarged sense of its varied pleasures and delights. I am certain that had we ventured out on our own even with many days we would never have seen what we saw with Abdul in our one day together. If you are planning a first visit to Marrakech, or even if you have already been, engaging him as a guide will vastly enlarge your appreciation and enjoyment of the city. He is a charming man, very knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. As I write this I am smiling as I remember what a marvelous time we had together. If you choose to engage Abdul I am certain that like us you will have a remarkable and memorable day. After realizing how much we had enjoyed our time together and how hopeless we were at bargaining we decided to avail ourselves of Abdul's shopping tour of the souks. We had one morning to shop and doubtless on our own we would have spent most of our time just trying to find our way around. With Abdul we were introduced to the artisans and the best vendors for the items we were wanting to buy. He interpreted for us, acted as intermediary, helped us negotiate, and judging by the number of bags we carried back to our hotel, helped us have a very satisfactory shopping experience. There are many, many wonderful things to buy in the souks and markets of Marrakech and without help you will most assuredly pay considerably more than you should. With help you will go to the best vendors and you will pay a fair price. It might seem absurd to hire someone to take you shopping but a few minutes in the souks will convince you of the wisdom of doing so. In this I can guarantee you will be 100% satisfied!"

Abdul tailored the tours to our interests (including photography), and showed us parts of Marrakech we would never have seen without him, including 'behind the scenes' tours of the public Hammam and community bakery. He even took the time as we walked away from our Riad on the first day to look backwards when we reached certain landmarks to show us how to find our way back. Really useful in the maze of the Souks. Take a comfortable and trusted pair of shoes, mine broke after 2 1/2 hours of walking and despite Abdul and the local cobbler's best efforts I had to walk barefoot (in the rain) until we could buy a new pair of shoes (and it was my birthday)! Abdul's best tip for crossing the road: 'If you're scared, just close your eyes and walk...'. Hilarious (if a little unnerving!) but it definitely worked :o) He was also happy to advise on things like what a taxi should cost, which street stalls served the best food, where to buy the best spices, etc etc. He even checked with us regularly about bathroom visits as he knew where the cleanest facilities were...We thoroughly enjoyed our time with Abdul, he was interesting, intelligent, and extremely knowledgeable and his English was perfect.

We contacted Abdul who was not free on the dates we wanted, he made a number of recommendations in terms of people to contact and we had a wonderful guide called Khalid Amor. His spoken English is perfect, he is intelligent and knowledgeable and has much patience.The other very noticeable thing about Khalid is his kindness to others.We had a day trip to Atlas Mountains, which is a must. To have the opportunity to witness how families live, the simplicity of their lifestyle, is humbling. The Berber lunch was tasty, loads of food, amazing hospitality, nothing was too much bother. We were able to appreciate what the impact of tourism has on families. The owners of the house where we had lunch showed us their home and told us of plans to extend and add new features to it so that they can offer short term accommodation to trekkers. Without tourism this would not be possible.The majority of the trip was made in a 4x4 -the short amount of time we spent walking was pretty arduous. Gravel, loose stones and rocks, steep inclines, dust and dirt....and this is how the locals get around! From when they are able to walk, their terrain is exactly this. They walk, jog, run, confidently and fluidly, the children play and the adults work. Animals, rabbits, cats, sheep, goats form part of the village.We loved our day and I highly recommend you do this.Our 2nd day with Khalid was the Hidden Tour of Marrakech. He picked us up at 10am from the Riad and we walked around monumental buildings and gardens, the souks, down dark alleys and into a very talented friend of his who was a blacksmith and then on to see a baker, who works 18 hours a day in front of an open oven, baking loaves for the locals.. We had lunch in the heart of the medina. The table and chairs and general surroundings were basic to say the least, but the food, once again was awesome. The service was spot on.Food generally was salads, fresh bread, oils, olives. Meat grill, cous cous, vegetables including Quince which I ate for the first time. All very tasty and generous portions.The square comes alive at 5pm onwards with food stalls, snake charmers, dancers, musicians, smells, noise, people. It is absolutely full on...oh- there were also 2 stalls selling false teeth!Do not expect to be able to take a photo without paying the subject matter some money. They will chase you for money and are very insistent.At one point I wanted to photograph some cats getting fed innards by a local butcher counter. I could, as long as I paid the butcher a tip.The souks are alleyways crammed with goods and people wanting you to buy from them. So be prepared for constant interruptions. Also be prepared for the chickens sold live then slaughtered on site, the goats heads and feet on display, the prepared carcasses hanging up waiting to be sold. Like many other countries, Marrakech have to feed themselves and the whole process of animal slaughtering is just a part of life.You will see mules pulling carts and will have to develop amazing senses to deal with the scooters being rode through the streets and souks at incredible speeds. Khalid helped us to make sense of it all. I would recommend to anyone visiting here for the first time, get a guide or you will miss so much of what makes this destination so magical.The only one downside and it wasn't really a down side as such, just a bit disappointing that we were taken to a shop that sold oils and tea and natural products. We were actually taken here for mint tea but quickly had a price list put in front of us. We succumbed and bought a few items and came away \u00a337 lighter! Once I got home and unpacked and looked again at what we had bought I realised we had been well and truly over charged...but there we are. The traders rely on us to provide a market for their products and I guess I should feel thankful that I can afford to be on holiday in Marrakech in the first place."

By the time we contacted him for our holiday he was only available for one day during our visit. Thankfully that number was greater than zero and we immediately booked for a day trip to Essaouira for our family of four with two teens (boy-15, girl-13).On the previous three days we engaged four other guides/companies for an all-day tour of the city/museums/gardens & souk; mountain biking in the Atlas and visiting a Berber family; and a cooking course. While those experiences were all fantastic, here's what I feel differentiated Abdul:* The pace of the tour. Granted, the Essaouira trip was designed to be more relaxed than say ticking off five museums in a morning in Marrakech, but you know when a guide is already walking away while you are still reading a sign or taking a photo or just their energy is restless? That's not Abdul. We managed to tick all the boxes on the agenda for the day - the argan cooperative, the souk, lunch, the fort, tea on the beach, etc. - without feeling rushed.* The conversation. I appreciated having a driver to focus on the driving (hours) AND a guide to focus on our experience and answer questions. I appreciated his perspective on politics in the region and the dozens of other questions I asked. It was educational.* The initiative to take photos. Before we asked he volunteered to take photos of us and was an experienced location scout. Usually I'm taking all the photos for my family so I'm glad at the end of a trip to have a few which include all of us. And his photos are good. I have some hilarious trees-coming-out-of-people's-heads or bizarre-framing or blurry photos taken by random helpful tourists, so it's nice to have some good family snaps."

Professional, friendly, knowledgeable and interesting, he helps you navigate the Medina, and shows you to bits of Marrakech you would ordinarily just walk past and miss. You can't miss this, especially on your first day in Morocco. It helps with getting your bearings immensely. Thanks Abdul!"

This was while we wandered through the souks, markets, squares and mosques. We all felt that we saw and learnt things we could not have done on our own. The second day we went to the High Atlas. En route we stopped at the local saturday market which was interesting and vibrant. At Umlil we walked for about an hour to a Berber village and chose to eat at a local home. This was the best meal we had both the food and company. The host was delightful and my 17 yr son learnt the skills of making mint tea, all with the most stunning views of the valley. Would highly recommend both tours."

He showed us some of the tourist sights, but we also got to experience \"real marrakech\", visiting the local bakery and meeting the man who keeps the hammam fire alight, which was an amazing experience.I will be honest with you, when we first arrived we thought we would never be able to leave our Riad, because we thought we may never find it again!!! (Marrakech is a bit of a maze) but thanks to Abdul he taught us the easiest way to navigate around the city, and once our tour was over we felt so confident.Paying for this tour was the money well spent, my advice to anyone going to Marrakech is BOOK ABDUL! Whether this is your first trip, or your tenth trip, you won't regret it."

The fact that Abdul grew up in the Medina is also an added bonus we got to see really cool local places within the medina. Abdul gave my husband and I plenty of time to look around at different places and take pictures. Honestly I was nervous about going to the Medina at first but I felt completely safe with Abdul as our guide and felt a ton better about walking around the medina after the tour. Definitely recommend a tour with him!"

There was no pressure to visit Souk's or buy anything. Abdul appeared to be friends with every other person living in the Medina, it was quite inspiring to watch. Was interesting to hear about the currently political situation in Marrakech. His style is very laid back and was a pleasure to take the tour with him. I was surprised at how quickly 4 hours passed. My brother and I did the tour with Abdul, and I would recommend doing it in a small group like that, as the larger tours didn't seem nearly as personal or fun. We found loads of places and hidden streets we went back to after the tour too. Thanks again Abdul!"

Abdul got back to us almost immediately and everything was straightforward in meeting him in Reception at our hotel. Although we were frequently asked if there was anything we wished to do or see in particular, this was difficult to answer as it was our first visit to Marrakech so we were very much in Abdul's hands. We needn't have worried as Abdul took excellent care of us and we all enjoyed a fascinating and interesting tour including a visit to see the Koutubia Mosque ( you can't go inside ), Gemma El Fna Square, a refreshing mint tea on the rooftop of a beautiful riad with gorgeous views, a tour of Ben Yousseff School, a tour of the Souks, useful information regarding cafe's and restaurants, visited a working traditional Moroccan flat bread making oven and Abdul even took us to his local school and the area in which he grew up as a young boy. All thoroughly enjoyable, even though the sun defeated some of us in the end! The parts I enjoyed most were the mint tea riad, the bread making, school and souks. Oh we did stop for a well- earned lunch in the cafe des epices which was good. But don't hesitate to ask Abdul anything you wish to know or about anywhere you wish to go - the only thing you'll be short of is time and / or energy. Thank you Abdul"

First, Abdul was very warm and friendly. His English was impeccable and easy to understand. He was a vast repository of knowledge and really tailored our tour with the things we were interested in seeing. If we had a question about something, whether history related, social or religion related, there was no topic off limit, and he was more than willing to help us understand his country and people.As an added plus, he led us to a fabulous place, which we would never have ventured into by ourselves, for lunch.The price for a full day tour with Abdul was very reasonable and I can't overemphasize how great of a guide he was. If we return to Marrakech, you can bet your bottom dollar that we will book another tour with him in order to see a different part of the city with his help next time.And, if like us, you are doing research for your first visit to Marrakech, please strongly consider making a day with Abdul one of your 'must-dos' - and do it as early into your trip as possible.

We were travelling with our 4 young children so we booked a half day tour for our second day. I can't rate Adbul and his tour highly enough. We were a little apprehensive about taking the children around the souks etc, and we did want our \"hands held\" slightly to give us a quick orientation. Abdul covered all this and more. He specifically tailored our tour to suit the children and their little feet not wanting to walk too much, and for our desire for them to see different parts of the souks. It was lovely to see Abdul greeting people and taking us to places we NEVER would have found unless by accident, while sharing his love and knowledge of this amazing city. I believe that this experience seeing the city through Abdul's eyes really helped shape our opinions and experience of the city from there on in and has left a true love of the city embedded in our children who can't stop talking about when they are going to come back when they grow up. We saw so much, but at a leisurely pace that suited our needs. If we had visited the souks without Abdul initially we may have felt harassed and perhaps put off revisiting but he quickly explained the love of life, happiness and banter that characterize the souks, let us try haggling and even when the tour was finished took my partner back to buy waterproof shoes (the hotel pool floor was cutting the childrens feet) The fact that he could find somewhere to buy them straight away is evidence of this mans true knowledge of the souks!! We wished we had booked him for further tours as he is such a lovely gentleman. Please do not hesitate to book with him..it will be the best choice you can make."

We arrived in Marrakech with the intention of seeing as much of the city attractions that we could and also wanted to visit a Berber village in the Atlas mountains.Our Riad owner had a leaflet for the mountains but it wasn't really what we wanted so we logged on to Trip advisor and chose this one,(Having already briefly looked before the holiday at tourism sites).The website was clear and precise so we sent an online request through to do the half day city tour and Atlas mountain trip with a couple of date options, Abdul promptly replied and arranged to meet us as our Riad.Having a guide to take you through the maze that is Marrakech centre makes it so much easier and clearer to get to the attractions and also get your bearings and sense of direction back! (We had spent our first 2 days wandering around the same route not realising there were shortcuts!).Abdul's knowledge and pride in his home city shine through and it is so much more interesting to hear personal stories too, you can literally talk about anything with him from politics to football or religion to lifestyle. He also shows an interest in you as well and is really easy to get to know, this obviously makes the tour a lot easier, comfortable and informal.It's useful to have a photographer on hand too, to be fair he takes a good photo!Next up we did the Berber mountains, this trip is such a great experience, that really made the holiday for me, Abdul and his driver picked us up from our Riad, drove us to the foot of the mountains (About an hour and a half) and we then had a light trek to a Berber home, the views are absolutely amazing, the air fresh and the local's warm and friendly along the way. I urge anyone with intention of doing this trip to take some stationary for the local children, they are so grateful for it and you will feel glad you did when you see their reactions.We met the home owner who was preparing a meal for us but first we had a tea ceremony, it takes half an hour to make but is worth the wait!Lunch was a nice salad, tagine and cous cous, followed by fresh fruit picked that morning, we commented on how nice the cherries were so en route back down the mountain we stopped to pick our own!!The home owner was a pleasure to meet, 26 years old, speaks four languages, does trekking tours and has aspirations to set up a lodge style business for the serious trekkers, he deserves every success and we swapped email addresses so hopefully will be able to see his progress.Overall we were very pleased to have done both of these trips and I would recommend them to anyone, also I wouldn't leave it until you arrive in Marrakech to book them as you can arrange from home before you go.We were lucky that it was a quiet time for tourists when we went so we got our chosen trips, but I would hate to think that we could have missed out on these experiences by not booking in time.Also in case you were unsure about going around the city with an old man, that isn't Abdul in the profile picture above, he's a bit younger than that!!!!!!!Thanks Abdul, 2 great trips that made our holiday! ;-)"

Abdul was very knowledgeable about the history and culture of the city and it was fantastic being able to spend the day with him.He knew the city really well and left us feeling at the end like we had truly seen the true Marrakesh and not just the tourist areas. Abdul also takes really good pics which is great when you are sick of trying to take selfies!! He took us to a local caf\u00e9 and I had the best beef tagine of the whole trip. My husband got to eat sheep head there as well which he does not stop going on about!It was so much nicer walking around the souks with him and not having to worry about getting lost, as well as not getting hassled anywhere as much. I would definitely recommend booking a tour with Abdul and will be booking again should we return in the future."

We wanted to live a real experience in Marrakech and to discover some non-touristy things to do and some hidden places in Marrakech. At the beggining, we wanted to do the Shopping tour in the souks, but Abdul suggested to mix the visit with some cultural sides of the city to have a complete vision of the Moroccan culture. So we walked around some historical quarters and monuments, we visited the Ali Ben Youssef Madrasa learning about the beautiful islamic art and architecture. We ate a typical dish with locals and we visited a traditional bakery and leather and wood workshops: we also learned the art of haggling in the souks! It was definetely what we were looking for, a real experience in Marrakech. We highly recommend Abdul to everyone traveling to this fantastic city. Thank you so much for this memorable day.Katharina and Lara."

He showed us his own old pre-school and told us about the local school-system. Abdul managed to show us not only the the classic \"must-see\" sports in marrakech, but also some places, that show the way, people life in marrakech. He is a very nice guy to have around and we truly enjoyed the time with him. Most importantly, he does not constantly talk, but also knows, when to just let someone have their own time to see and feel the city. I will most definetly reconmend him to anyone who would ask about a tourguide in marrakech."

This was our first visit to Marrakech.Abdul met us promptly at our riad and led us on a tour that combined the medina, souks and several of the major historic and cultural sites as I'd requested. Abdul was vey willing to tailor the tour to our desires and adjusted to our needs as the day went on. As some other reviewers have described, Abdul can expose you to some truly local experiences that I'm sure many tourists never enjoy. These experiences proved to be some of the highlights of our entire two-week trip to Spain and Morocco. When I told Abdul that I'd made my own ras el hanout (a traditional Moroccan spice mix), he took us to his favorite spice vendor on our way back to the riad so I could purchase the authentic thing. It was so fragrant I couldn't believe it. I cooked with it the other night and not only did it taste great, it brought me back to our time in Marrakech.I highly recommend Abdul for his knowledge of this amazing city and his professional service."

Even well after his ...responsibilities as a guide for one were over, he helped me with more than one crisis that arose.

Walking around Marrakech it was clear he knows many people and is well liked but we never felt that the day was outside of what we were interested in. There was not a long line of cousins waiting to sell us their goods.His English was very good and he took us around what we were interested in. On the way we did a large circuit of the city where we visited Dar Si Said (a museum of Morrocan arts), the old Jewish quarter, a number of nice places to have coffee and cake, a cobler, spice markets, a lamp shop, bakery, hammam oven and a general cross section of the souks. Really just a tour of life in Marrakech.Interspersed with all this he explained the culture and history of Marrakech and was never unable to answer our many questions. I couldn't recommend Abdul enough and if he hadn't been booked for the rest of the week we would have done more with him."

Abdul also helped us with directions on other places we wanted to visit later that week and also best places to buy things and exchange money for the best rates.I cannot thank Abdul for a great day, we really enjoyed our time with him. My advice would be make sure you have plenty of money exchanged in Dirhams, especially in small change as we made the mistake of only having big notes!

A tour with Abdul is a different, and I imagine much better, experience than you're likely to have with many other tour providers in Marrakech. Abdul led a group of three of us around the city--rather than insist on hitting a handful of big and well-known sites and moving us from place to place, Abdul was an oasis of calm in a busy city, taking the time to really explain the history and culture of the city, how it's changed for better and for worse, and taking the time to answer our questions thoughtfully and in depth. His knowledge of Marrakech is deep and personal and his style focuses more on the experience of the tour group than rushing everyone around for it's own sake. If your own personal travel style places a greater emphasis on really getting to know a place over simply checking the boxes that you've seen a site listed in the guidebook, do yourself a favor and contact Abdul for a tour--you won't be disappointed."

We know Abdul is well respected in the community as frequently people would come up to him and greet him kindly. He patiently answered our questions and taught us a lot about the Moroccan culture. Abdul helped us buy some Moroccan products (such as bitter orange blossom oil for cooking, Argan oil and couscous), using his negotiating talents to ensure we got the best products from the most reputable sellers that he, himself, even buys from. He brought us to a local tagine restaurant just off Jemaa el Fna where the locals eat, and we got to see a community bake oven and taste the bread. We met the man in charge of the fire for heating the hammam waters and heard him play his traditional goat skin guitar.

I can not recommend this tour highly enough. Abdul arrived promptly at our Riad at 9.30 and our journey began. The tour is as specific or general as you want it to be. What my friend and I found invaluable is that Abdul took us places we would not have come across had we wandered the streets alone. For example we were taken to see the local bread ovens, where the women and children left their bread to bake in the mornings. This was in a very discreet doorway and had you not known it was there you would have gone straight past. Abdul not only gives you a sense of the history or Marrakech, but also gives you an idea of how the inhabitants live. The guide of the souks was fantastic, we were taken to corners that I am sure we would never have found had we been left to wander alone. Being able to see the metal workers and tanners working at their craft is a must see. Thanks to Abdul, we were not only able to find our way back to our Riad and to navigate the Souks successfully but we also had the confidence to go out and make the most of what Marrakech has to offer.Adbul has a great sense of humour, is very knowledgeable and was a pleasure to spend the day with.

Marrakech can be a very confusing city for outsiders, but it's guides like Abdul that can give you a greater understanding of its people and culture."

For her it became the highlight of our 6 days in Marokko. Especially eating the smoked sheepmeat with salt and cumin. Never booked a cityguide before. Would certainly do it again. It is an efficient way of meeting the heart of a city. Especially if your have such an experienced guide. And who will absolutely will not take you to any commercial shop. If you want to bargain he is more than willing to assist you. The funny thing is we met by accident a colleque at the middle of Jamaa el Fna. She and her partner looked somewhat bewildered of all the intense impressions. We on the other hand found ourselves totally confident and relaxed in Abdul's company. He thought us a lot of all different aspect of the city and we came in places we would never found on our own."

We met Abdul on our first full day in Marrakesh which was a great way to familiarise ourselves with the city as well as learn a whole lot about the culture and history. Abdul is very knowledgeable and has a great love for his 'home town' and tailored our tour to take in the sights we were interested in. If you're more interested in the lives of the people rather than the history leave out the Badi Palace where the storks next - you can go back to this on your own. I would have liked to have seen a school and the bread makers and wool dyers - but there just isn't enough time to do it all!We were particularly grateful that Abdul was willing to assist us in bartering for a couple of souvenirs which we just wouldn't have bought without him. He gave us the confidence to have a go ourselves the next day. As well as guiding us around, Abdul also made several suggestions of things we could go back to or do on our own - his great directions got us back through the souk to the Caf\u00e9 de Espice which is a lovely place to people watch. On another day we also took Abdul's tour to the Berber Village in the High Atlas mountains, which was a fabulous day. We were driven by a mountain guide who was happy to stop when ever there was a photo opportunity (quite often) and Abdul was very informative about the area we were passing through and the Berber house experience was something we would have missed out on without his help. We were shown the correct way to make mint tea, crack walnuts and eat with our hands with much laughter and good humour. I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to sit with the women of the household teasing wool and watching the children playing on the lower terrace.Thank you, Abdul. You made our holiday one to remember for a long time."

I was very clear - as two females (mother and daughter) travelling alone, my main concern was to be able to walk confidently round Marrakech and be able to orientate ourselves in terms of the key central areas of the city. Abdul clearly understood our concerns and managed not only to achieve this but also to show us some key historical sites and introduce us to something of the values and culture of Marrakech. We particularly loved the chance to visit a little kindergarten ( which he had attended himself as a child), the local bakery and a great place where locals had lunch ( we tried the tangia which was excellent.). Abdul also gave us advice on prices and bargaining in the souks and places to eat in Jamaa El Fna. All of his advice was totally sound and stood us in good stead for the rest of our visit.Abdul is a charming and respectful guide who is clearly passionate about his city - our private day tour was very well paced, with plenty of time to absorb the atmosphere and ask questions. The next day, when we were shopping in the souks, we met Abdul again, with another couple of visitors. It was great to see how pleased he was that we were happily and confidently negotiating the intricacies of the souks and the square. Job done!."

On viewing other past positive reviews on Abdul it made sense for us to book him for effectively our \"one day\" city tour. Abdul is very flexible on what places and things you would like to see. But obviously in the end it is impossible to practically fit everything in in one day. Overall, we were very glad that we booked the full day with Abdul. Nothing felt rushed and we were able to see pretty much most of the top five or six things we had selected at the beginning of our discussions to see (tanneries were unfortunately too far outside of the City centre to include and the tombs we prudently skipped as we had arrived too late in the morning and the queues were up to an hour long). If you truly want to experience the real side of Marrakech (not mentioned anywhere in 3 guide books I had)- where the locals buy their spices, meat, fruits and vegetables, where they actually eat (the chef in one of the restaurants we saw actually cooks for the King on occasions - and yes the food was very tasty as we had time for some lunch); where people take their bread in the morning to be baked; where the local people and also restaurants take their little clay pots for the meat and veg to be slow cooked; and also take in the whole manufacturing industry behind the souks giftware offerings (leather makers \u2013 shoes, belts; metal workers -lampshades etc. etc.) Abdul is the guide you need. Abdul, is very knowledgeable about most things we discussed, and made us feel instantly at ease walking around the city's secret back streets where inevitable we would have got lost and wasted our critical valuable time if we had gone alone. Overall, for all of the bad rumours we heard about being hassled and unfriendly people before we came, I would say that Marrakesh is the complete opposite. Abdul helps you understand that, and how life is there! After all, in the end, everyone is only trying to get by and make a living (including the snake charmers in the square \u2013 so don't try to be sneaky, just pay them a few coins for a picture = meal for their families). Even walking around the souks Abdul gave us an idea of finding our own way around whilst explained the art of bartering. On our own later, we did walk away on a couple of occasions when we were not happy with the price, and to be frank, in comparison we had more hassle in Istanbul main souk market a few years back. If we had had more time, or indeed decide to come back again for some winter sun, I would definitely book another tour with Abdul. Price is reasonable relative to time and other alternative guides that were available, plus he is flexible (we were a party of 2) but he allows up to 5 people should you are a bigger party or wanted to join up with other people."

He really knows his way around the city, and showed us things we would have never found on our own, or even thought to look for. We visited various markets, a hamam where local bread gets baked, and got an introduction into the souk. We stopped for lunch at a place that was excellent and did not feel super-touristy. Abdul's knowledge of Marrakech and its history could not be beat, and we are so glad that we were able to learn so much from him on our first day in the city."

He was great in responding to his emails, as we only contacted him on the previous Saturday night, and was he was efficient in making plans for the following morning. The tour itself definitely did not disappoint and there was no doubt that Abdul was the best man for the job! He showed us corners of the city that we would definitely not have visited otherwise and his explanations and descriptions during the guided walks were incredibly detailed. Furthermore, his willingness to answer all of our questions and tailor the tour to our interests made it that much more enjoyable. He was also able to give us really good recommendations of where to visit and eat at during the remaining time of our visit. I would happily recommend his tours to anybody who wants to see the real Marrakech and learn about it's culture and Abdul's sense of humour will guarantee you a great visit!"

It's not easy to navigate through the streets of Marrakech (street signs are hard to find and are in Arabic), so it is important to get a guide. Abdul was most knowledgable about the city, it's history and life. He brought us to where the locals would go to, including local eating joints (where we had the best lamb lunch). On route, we noticed that Abdul was well respected within the community. Top class professionalism!"

The E-mail replies from Abdul gave me confidence and this was confirmed when he came to meet our family (4) at our Riad for the start of our tour. We then spent 7+ hours in his company walking around Marrakech learning the history and culture of this fabulous city. I had asked Abdul to tailor the tour to take account of our two lads, 14 & 12 and their limited attention span for Museums & Gardens and to keep it interesting for them in other ways and this he did in spades; watching dye-ers, tin makers, bakers, a private viewing of a synagogue etc with the tour of the Medina interspersed with detours into great places that we would not have otherwise have found.Don't waste any time looking for another guide for city tours in Marrakech, period. Our tour was great from start to finish. Abdul is intelligent, and a caring and friendly guy with a good sense of humour and with a huge encyclopedic local knowledge which he is happy to share and he will tailor your tour exactly to your wishes. So If you are heading to Marrakech and you should, post him an e-mail and book a tour, but for early on in your stay, as we did, and then you have time to go back and spend more time in the many areas he will show you and one's you don't have time for but want to see more of."

I'm normally quite critical when it comes to reviewing holiday services / tours, however Abdul and his company fly way above any other experience we had during our recent holiday to Marrakech (and believe me they were good). My partner and I were a little apprehensive about booking a guided tour outside of the normal 'Holiday company organised ventures', but were so glad we did after our half day private guided tour with Abdul. It was fabulous from start to finish. Abdul is a sensitive , intelligent and very amiable chap with a great sense of humour and simply the best local knowledge that he will tailor to whatever you want to know/ do whilst on your tour. With him we saw, tasted and awed at things we would never have seen or experienced in Morocco. From historic buildings, local eateries that welcomed us back after the tour, to the real traditional fibre of the day to day life of local Moroccans plus all at fabulous value ! You need not worry when travelling to meet him as he welcomes you straight from your shuttle bus to start your tour. A huge thank you Abdul for your time. Yours was a top, top, top experience and we'll contact you for sure next time we're in Marrakech to book more private tours"

Next thing we were on a bus heading into town to be expertly informed about the history and culture of this amazing city.The tour of the medina was interspersed with detours into wonderful places that one would not have otherwise discovered - suffice to say if you decide to go you too will enjoy the same experiences. We also booked Abdul to take us to a Berber house in the Atlas mountains where we enjoyed the hospitality and food of a young man who has set up a sustainable tourism destination Imlil Authentic Toublak Lodge for trekking holidays. If you have the good fortune to go to this place you will be amazed at the totally different way of life. The tranquility and beauty of this area is truly breathtaking.

We booked a full day tour and it was super informative, interesting and a great value. We learned about spices, music, leather goods, history and found a new favorite sandwich that costs a euro! Our son got see so many things and taped some great stuff to show his classmates back home. Abdul is very polite and patient and his English is great. We also learned some Arabic words from him. He really caters the tour to what you want to do/see. I honestly wished that we would have hired him the whole time we were in Marrakech because it was so much easier and calmer when he was with us. He knows a great leather guy for Moroccan poufs and I might just take him up on his offer to send us one as we didn't buy one right then and then never found him again! The quality was great. I'm thinking of doing a girls shopping trip and believe me, he will hopefully be able to be with us the whole time!

Whenever we go to a city where we have never been, we have gotten into the habit of hiring a tour guide for the first day to acclimate ourselves to the new environment. We found Adbul here on Tripadvisor while researching our trip to Marrakech. We arranged for him to meet us at our Riad the first day and hired him for a full day.From the first few minutes with Abdul, we knew we had made a good decision to hire him. His knowledge of the city, and the history, politics and religion that shape it, are truly second to none. We learned so much just by listening to him as he guided us through the Medina. I am certain we saw things that we never would have found without him.He took us to an amazing little restaurant in the souk, not sure of the name, but ask him to take you to the place where they serve steamed lamb. They lower it into a deep hole in the ground and slow roast it all day and then sell it by the kilo. You eat it with your fingers and dip it in salt and cumin. So delicious! We never would have found this place on our own and if we had, never would have dared to go in and eat, mostly because of the sheeps heads on stakes at the front! LOL! But it was amazing!He guided us through the souks with such expertise that it was actually a great, non/stressful experience. If you tell him what you are looking for, he can take you to the best places to get it and also tell you what you should expect to pay, which is very helpful.After our full day with Abdul, we dared to go out on our own the next day. it was a totally different experience. We got lost, got hassled by guys on the streets and were just not having fun. We looked at each other and laughed and said *We miss Abdul!!*. So we sent him an email and crossed our fingers that he had the next day available. He did, so we hired him for our last day, for another full day tour.The second day was just as good as the first. We went to the Jewish quarter, the Yves St. Laurent gardens and lots of shopping for fabulous Morrocan textiles.Abdul really goes the extra mile for his clients. NOTHING is too much. If you want something and cannot find it, don\\t be surprised if he drops it off for you at your riad. That is just the kind of guy he is. Thoughtful, generous, kind, smart and just nice to be around.Don't waste your money using anybody else. Abdul is as far as you have to look. He will make your Marrakech experience unforgettable and you will also leave having made a friend.We wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone who asked! Book him! NOW! Seriously!"

This time we decided to organize our expeditions with a local tour guide as we did not dare to go everywhere last time.We found Abdul over the internet as he already had good reference. The alternative was to book the tours through our hotel. In the end I decided to go for Abdul as he was aready very proactive in suggesting interesting trips. We spent two days in Marrakech, one in a small Berber village in the Atlas mountains and one in a fishermen village called Essouira. Abdul was great and we could not have expected a better tour guide, as he showed us the secret cornes you would never see without a local guide. Abdul is not only very professional and highly educated but very much concerned and responsible about social minorities like children in Berber villages. I do highly recommend him. If you want to book a tour with Abdul you better get in contact with him at least two months ahead, as he is totaly booked out. One last thing. If you want to buy anything in Marrakech or during your trips, like spices, tea, argan oil, etc.. you have to tell Abdul as he will not take you for shopping. This is very unusual as guides tend to take you shopping. This is the difference between a professional guide and a \"shopping guide\". But when you ask Abdul for high quality Maroccan products he will take you to the right places or even offer you to buy you the spices at his home shop - which probably will cost 5 times less than what you will be ever able to bargain on the market ..."

I will say that I have always been a little hesitant on taking tours in general, but after experiencing it with Abdul, I can honestly say that it has CHANGED! Abdul is EXTREMELY informative not only in the area, the culture, and the way of life in Morroco. This HELPED a lot since I will honestly say that I was somewhat apprehensive being in Marrakech, at least initially. He explained that the houses are built with the inside of the house in mind, which then can make it SEEM as though the house is somewhat run down, at least from the outside. He also made sure that we saw what are the highlights of the area, but MADE sure that we would see what we wanted to see. He even was able to get a picture of my wife and I - she does not \"usually like\" having pictures taken of her. As stated in another review, he made it VERY easy for us to not only find our way around, but also with the local customs. Now on our other tour of the Atlas Mountains, he again was EXTREMELY informative about the area and also was able to arrange for us to have lunch in someone's house where he is converting part of it to a Riad. This not only made it quite comfortable, but also VERY welcomed since we were able to meet and interact with the \"local people\" and NOT with a typical tourist trap. He is great as a guide, I wish I could clone him and have him give us a tour in other parts of the world as we go and visit it. I know that if/when we go back and visit Marrakech, we would love to not only see Abdul again both on a personal and business level, I feel as though I have made a good friend \"half way around the world.!\""

Abdul came highly recommended per TripAdvisor reviews, so I quickly booked a half day city tour. Abdul picked us up at our Riad at 14:30 on the dot and proceeded to explain his suggested itinerary. Importantly, he was completely open to changes depending on what we had already seen during our sightseeing, and what we were most hoping to learn during our touring. We decided on a walk through the Jewish Quarter since this was where our Riad was located. Then we proceeded throughout the Old City, taking in the Souks, Djemaa el-Fna, Koutoubia Minaret, and finally on to Ali Ben Youssef Madrasa and Museum. Being guided by Abdul was truly a relaxing experience as he knew the intricate narrow lanes of the Old City like the back of his hand. My husband and I had gotten lost numerous times on our own (trust me! even with a map the Old City is very difficult to navigate). Abdul is an extremely knowledgeable guide. He provided a very through introduction to the rich history of Marrakech. He patiently answered all of our questions and was happy to extend the tour when we asked for his assistance with a purchase. We didn\u2019t realize until near the end of our tour but Abdul had been going non-stop since 9AM that morning. He had an earlier half day tour and hadn\u2019t even had time for lunch. We never would have guessed. He spoke enthusiastically about his hometown and was a joy to tour with."

He responded vey quickly and was able to fit in with our suggested time (even though it transpired it was his day off). We had a brief email discussion about what we wanted and he checked on this hen he came and met us at our Riad. We very much left the Tour up him and he guided us on a circular route around the Medina including the Bahia Palace and the Mellah area. He pitched things just right with plenty (but not too much) of detail. The pace was languid as he wanted to give us time to look at things as we went. He pointed out good places to come back to and eat and also gave us advice to help us find our way around the Medina on our own (which can be a challenge) including showing us to the restaurant we had chosen for lunch the end of the tour (making the tour longer than agreed). He finished the tour with a visit to local we will never forget that was fantastic but I won't spoil further as I think this is a regular highlight. The final remarkable thing about Abdul is never once did he try to steer us into his \"cousins\" shop. Highly recommended for a laid back introduction to the Medina."

When we first met Abdul, we were struck by how friendly, calm, warm and engaging he was. Abdul made a point of spending time clarifying exactly what we wanted to get out of our tour, which really helped to personalise our experience. I understand this is something that Abdul sees as being very important. Once he had a sense of our desires for the tour, it was very apparent that he made every effort to tailor it accordingly, which meant that we saw and did things that we found really interesting, vibrant and fun! For example, he helped us source a beautiful handmade leather pouffe for our home from a reputable merchant, took us to an awesome little restaurant for tangia for lunch, showed us around many beautiful historical sights including a museum, palace, the Katoubia Minerate, the many souks, and the main square. He also helped us to purchase some beautiful bitter orange oil which you can burn for the scent or use as a salad dressing! He was super knowledgable and passionate about Marrakech and was able to answer literally any question we had for him. He clearly loves what he does, and is good at it. Abdul is certified and professional - I understand there are some less reputable guides who are not certified - Abdul came highly recommended and we were very happy with our experience with him. Abdul was generous with his time and energy, and has great interpersonal skills. He also speaks fluent english which we found helpful. Abdul really helped us orientate ourselves in a city which can be quite overwhelming - the tour really helped us to feel confident in navigating the place ourselves in subsequent days, and helped us to feel excited about being in such a vibrant and interesting place! We could not recommend Abdul highly enough - you leave feeling like you would like to be friends with him! We went as a couple, but would recommend the tour for families, friends, solos - anyone really!"

            "review": "Unquestionably the best: Abdul (Marrakech Guided Day Tours). I traveled to Marrakech for four days and spent three on tours with Abdul because I wanted to experience as much as I could in such a short time. I chose him because of tripadvisor reviews and his beautiful website. The first day Abdul came to the riad and we made a general plan that included the specific interests I had describe when I booked him: day to day life, music, richness of the culture, the beauty of the architecture. As the day unfolded, I discovered all of that plus the framework of history and the rhythm of a city whose attraction stems from historical sites spanning centuries, the high energy square and colorful souks, and the private backstreets that protect the intimacy of family and home. Each quarter of the city held surprises: a literary cafe that sponsors artists and poets and community events, an explanation of the door within a door on family homes, attention to the layers of materials used to construct buildings down through the centuries, a stop at the primary school Abdul attended as a kid, attention to the craftsmanship that it takes to create the beauty that surrounds you, a demonstration of making slow cooked lamb on the coals of the furnace that heats the hammam (expert multitasking), the caravanserais or fondouks in the old medina that that supported commerce on ancient trade routes and so much more. Then on to the souks to get a feel for the layout. There was no pressure to buy, but invaluable advice about specific things I was interested in getting later when I returned on my own. There was food to nibble, like dates and olives and pomegranates. And serious food-- the most delicious, tender lamb dinner in the world. That evening at the riad no one had similar tales to tell. All the words in previous reviews are true: comfortable, knowledgeable, engaging; it felt like we were being guided around with a friend. Book Abdul early in your stay in Marrakech, and you'll feel at ease in this magical city."

For half a day Abdul charges 500 dirhams which is about \u00a345 to provide you with a tailor made tour. We wanted to see the old town and the museums with the advantage of having the history from a local and not a book. Abdul really knows his stuff and made the whole experience thoroughly enjoyable. We learnt so much and went to places we would never have thought of or knew about. He is also on hand for advice after the tour so it doesn't just end at the last stop in Jemna-el-fna. Abdul guided us through some Dars, the souks (briefly as you can spend hours there) and the museums. He provided us with restaurant and bar recommendations. Definitely worth every dirham!Full review on Large and Laughing."

I travelled to Marrakech in June 2013 with my other half and we booked a half-day tour with Abdul on our very first day in the city. I cannot recommend this tour enough, especially at the start of your holiday so you feel confident in navigating the souks and with the culture. His English was excellent and he was a calm sort of guy- a good thing amongst busy Marrakech. As we were staying a bit outside the centre, we met Abdul outside the Mosque and it was easy to find him. He greeted us warmly and gave us a brief but interesting history of the area and was able to answer my questions. We then wandered through the Medina, having navigation tips explained to us as we went. He loves his city and seems very settled.We met locals, saw their daily routines, drank tea with them and learnt that it's ok to say 'no' in the souks when you don't want to do a deal! I probably would have found it unnerving to haggle but having a local with us, gave me the confidence to try it out before I did it on my own later in the holiday. At some points during the tour, I wanted to take photos of certain things and I looked to him to see if it was appropriate. He generally gave a reassuring nod of approval... as an ex art student, I'm a bit snap-happy but didn't want to cause anyone offence by photographing their shop fronts/family.We saw so much more than we ever would have found ourselves as he knew exactly where he was going. Lots of people knew him as we walked along, shaking his hand & saying hello - it was nice to watch! I cannot recommend booking this tour enough. Don't hesitate, just do it :)"

Even though it was the first day of Ramdan, and the heat was brutal, he tried to pack as much in as possible, which I appreciate. I also used a private tour guide later the next day recommended by my hotel who was cheaper (200 Dirhan for 3 hours), but perhaps not as seasoned nor knowledgeable as Abdul. would use Abdul again when I come back to Marrakech.

I contacted them and my emails were answered promptly. It helps if you have some idea of what you want to see during the tour depending on your interests. Otherwise they will put something together for you. You can do half or full day tours. As the working souks are closed on Fridays it is better to choose another day. Wear comfortable walking shoes.Our Guide, Abdul, met us at our Riad in the Medina at 9.30am as promised, for a half day walking tour. We learned all about the history of Marrakech as we walked through the alleyways of the Medina. As we walked he told us when each part of the Medina was built - he was born in the Medina and knows much about this fascinating part of Marrakech. The pace was leisurely and there was time for taking photos. We visited the bakery and watched the bread being baked. We visited the hammam, meeting the man who cooks the tangias for the locals. He is also a musician so he played some music for us. We took photos at each of these places - take your 20 dirham notes if you want photos. No money - no photos! We visited some of the working souks, the Medersa Ben Youssef and the Museum of Marrakech, which is close by. As we walked back to the Djemma el Fna through the souks with Abdul we realized how much knowledge he had shared with us during the tour, which ended at 1.00 pm. Abdul answered all our questions and took some photos for us. We could not have wished for a better Guide."

Due to Ramadan and the heat, we did a half-day tour, and I can imagine it very hard for one to be fasting and guiding clients through the city in the middle of summer. Yet that didn't stop him. He brought up many interesting facts and historical references that led to many more follow-up questions. He is also very attentive to details. We asked questions we wouldnt have considered asking for we just wouldnt have known. This makes him a true exception unlike some other tripadvisor-recommended guides who say just a little more than that already captured on the Lonely Planet or on Wikipedia.

A tailor made fun and historic filled three and a half hours. We paid a one off payment for the tour which was extremely reasonable and there was no 'carpet showroom' or 'silver factory' visits to be seen. I had let Abdul know roughly what we was after and he made sure he covered it all. We saw some great architecture and went through the winding souks in the medina and learnt a lot about the regular day to day lives of how moroccans conduct their business from baking bread, cooking in tangines (different pot shape to the tagine) and we went off the beaten track into the winding alleys and corridors of Marrakech. Abdul is extremely knowledgeable and has perfect ensglish and got the 'humour' of our group very quickly. Our time with Abdul went very quick and overall is a great intro into sightseeing in Marrakech. He will also tailor make/copy any package tour you could get from your travel agents and a much better cost. If I go back to Marrakech I will certainly look Abdul up and organise another trip or two with him as there is so much to see and do. Abdul looks after you with care and tenacity and made sure we had a taxi back to the hotel and we never felt worried or stranded. We went on our tour at 9:30am whilst it was still fairly cool. Many places to stop for water and comfy shoes a must. Please try Abdul as I cannot express how comfortable he made us all feel and he has a very good sense of humour too. Thank you Abdul, you were a mjaor part of our holiday as we then visited some of the places for longer rather than pay Thomas cook or First choice fees which aredouble if you DIY."

            "review": "Excellent Tour Guide!. We were ten tourism students from Switzerland who were staying in Marrakech for one week. To become more familiar with both the Medina as well as the history of Marrakech, we booked a half day guided tour with Abdul from Marrakech Guided Tours. Abdul picked us up from our Riad and showed us the way to the main entrance of the Souks. On our tour through the Medina we not only explored the Souks but also gained an insight into a traditional bakery, were able to listen to a traditional musician while enjoying a tea and visited an old Koran school and the Museum of Marrakech. During the whole tour, Abdul provided us with very interesting and profound information about the Medina and the local people\u2019s traditions and everyday life.All in all, Abdul was an excellent tour guide and we could not have been more pleased. We would highly recommend Abdul to anyone who is interested in exploring Marrakech."

            "review": "What an amazing guide!. Right from the very start, Abdul was quick to answer my emails and very helpful, assuring me that we could see everything we wanted to in his incredible Marrakech in the short time that we had. We met Abdul on our first evening, he arrived at our Riad just as promised and right on time. We had a introductory tour of the night market on the main square. Incredible experience to watch the sun set over the hundreds of food stalls billowing smoke, the buzz of entertainers, story tellers, snake charmers, fortune tellers, acrobats - it was truely unforgettable.The next morning we met Abdul again (feeling much more confident navigating through the twisty back streets if the Medina now thanks to his help the previous night!) We spent a day together which is difficult to put into words, we covered many of the main sights in this beautiful and historical city, but more than that, we learnt so much about the history, culture and daily lives of the people here. We met a community baker, hammam fire stoker and musician, local school teacher and young students, some of the best stall owners in the souks (no pressure to buy anything, just helpful advice on who to see for the best quality things we wanted), fantastic restaurant where even the King himself has eaten, but is so reasonable that the locals eat there everyday, plus as mentioned, sights such as Koutoubia Mosque, Majorelle Gardens, Ben Yousseft Madrasa, Marrakech Museum and many more. Abdul is such a generous, knowledgeable, kind and sincere man with such a deep understanding and love of this city and the people here. Having lived here all his life he knows every part of Marrakech intimately. By the end of our time with him we had learnt so much and felt like we had a really good understanding of this amazing place and can't wait to return to experience more. If you come to Marrckach you simply must try to book a tour with Abdul, given how good he is book early - as he is in demand! Truely a life changing experience to vistit this beautiful, vibrant, historical city with such a wonderful guide and lovely person as Abdul. Thank you so much Abdul, and we look forward to see you again when we return to Marrakech!"

We were a little dubious about heading out alone into the Souks of Marrakech.Abdul provided a half day walking tour around the main sites within the Medina and insightful history and general information about the city and the Moroccan people.We were supposed to finish at 6pm but Abdul was happy to continue our tour until after 8pm to make sure we saw as much as possible.We highly recommend Marrakech guided tours near the beginning of your stay in Marrakech in order to give you the confidence to \"go it alone\" during the rest of your holiday.We also went on the Atlas mountains tour which was a very relaxing experience. Off the general tourist path you can meet and eat with the local Berber people. A great experience."

We only had a day and a half in Marrakech, so we opted for the half day tour as an introduction to the city, and we are delighted we did. We were initially wary about Marrakech (travelling with a young daughter of 2) but those concerns seemed completely unfounded by the time we'd finished our tour. The tour was excellently paced, informative, and a great insight to the medina. It's a good way of orientating yourself. Abdul really knows his stuff, and is happy to on practically any topic. We had regular stops so the little one could get out of the backpack and wander about, he covered all the major things that we asked to see, and he had lots of recommendations for bars and restaurants for the rest of our time in Marrakech. We ended the tour at our Riad, and Abdul walked us back there, giving us lots of pointers so we could find our own way home next time. He was very prompt at responding to emails, and arrived to collect us from the Riad bang on time, as he said he would. In short: our half day tour was time very well spent. We have no hesitation in recommending Abdul."

We really felt like he took good care of us and what we got out of it was way more than what we paid. Throughout our next couple of days we would run into him and he always came by to say hello and make sure that we were OK and having a good time.

From the 1st email conversation I knew that Abdul was going to be the perfect guide. He grew up a few metres away from the Riad where we were staying, so we had some great images of growing up in the area from the very first minute. We were taken to a local baker and ate fresh bread and pizza straight from the oven. We were given an impromptu concert from the boiler man for the hammam ( after stoking the fire, he played a few songs for us.) Abdul was able to show us Inside Marrakech and also showed us the sights that I asked to be included in our itinerary (museum of marrakech and the Koran school) This was the best way to be introduced to Marrakech and as this was in the afternoon of our arrival, we didn't even have Moroccan dirhams at the time, Abdul was very generous and paid entrance fees until we were able to get to an ATM. If you are looking for genuine Marrakech with a genuinely honest and knowledgeable guide, then look no further, Abdul IS your man. Many thanks Abdul, hopefully we will meet again someday. J & S"

It was a day well spent in his company, exploring the entire Medina following in the footprints of history. At first I thought that a full day tour would be too much for my 2 teenage nephews and my 2 young adult daughters, but he captured all our attention with his knowledge and passion for Marrakech. He opened our eyes to a culture so interesting and beautiful and made our tour a fun learning experience. Before the tour began, he asked us what we wanted to see and gave us a brief summary of what we could expect for the next 7 hours. Surprisingly, time just flew by so quickly. I loved the fact that knew how to capture the attention of all 4 kids and made sure they were engaged and participated in our conversations!We walked into the oldest part of the Medina and visited with the local baker, was entertained by the hammam water heater/tangia cook, saw artisans working their crafts and he even recommended the best restaurant for Roast Lamb right smack in the middle of the Souk! We wanted Shawarma for lunch and he took us to a pretty good place (kids went back the next day!) He also treated us to his son's favorite cookie as we wandered through the streets of his old neighborhood! Abdul is a Superb Tour Guide - with his excellent command of English and remarkable knowledge of Marrakech, its History and Culture comes to life as he walks you through the tiny cobbled streets of the Medina.Email Abdul and Book the Full Day Tour - it will be a day well spent!"

We loved the bakery, the fearless man heating the water for the hammam, the stalks on the royal gates, the spices, the Moroccan Banksy and many many more sights and smells. Abdul is clearly a well educated man who exudes his passion for his country very naturally and honestly.

Abdul knows a lot of things we didn't find in our travelling books (we always prepare and read a lot before travelling to a country/city).We did a half day tour with our children (age 8 and 10). They don't speak English so we had to translate for them. In the beginning we had to ask Abdul to stop giving more information so that we could translate for the children but after a while Abdul saw when we needed to translate and gave us time to do it (this is very important because the children get bored if they have to wait for a long time for new information)For our children a half day was enough and they liked it very much and also learned a lot. For them it was very important that Abdul had also answers to their (child)questions !Just a small tip for improvement: we didn't realise we needed some small money to tip some people (for example the man of the backery).

This in itself made the whole place so much less daunting and a whole lot more comfortable and safe! I would say to have this information and to feel so welcomed on your first day is priceless and definitely worth the money for the tour.AbdulRazzaq was very knowledgeable of the city, having lived in the old city through his childhood, which we later got to see. He took us to the hammam where the coals were warmed and we were met with amazing musical entertainment and mint tea when we got to meet the coal burner up close and personally. This moment alone was worth the tour- absolute once in a life time opportunity which a normal \"tourist\" probably won't get to see easily. Following this we also go to see the bakery and how the locals have their bread baked.We must have seen everything there was to see just in this one day, so had a really good idea of what we wanted to spend more time on in the following days.The best part of the tour is getting close to the locals, and really choosing what you wish to see.Definitely recommend to all."

            "review": "Genuine, ethical, knowledgeable: Perfect guide for crazy city. We actually just finished the last 2 days with Abdul and are still in Marrakech. He was such a fantastic guide that I needed to write this review as it was still fresh in my head. First, we are a family of 3 which includes a rambunctious 4 year old. Abdul was a breath of fresh air in a city that will completely disorientate you and was a calming influence. The things that I expect from a guide were completely blown away by Abdul. He always looked out for our best interests, he entertained our 4 year old, he made sure that vendors were being genuine, showed us activities that no one else can show you on a mega tour, his knowledge base is amazing and no question was left unanswered. His love for his country completely shines through -- while he obviously made this a career you can still see his genuine appreciation for showing us his country and enthusiasm.We booked 2 tours;1. Full day tour -- lasts about 8 hours -- he showed us all the major sites -- he let us contour or tailor the tour with our interests during the entire day. For example, I needed a US travel adapter because our hotel did not have one that worked and Abdul helped me find one, it was rather cold weather here and he helped my wife find a shawl -- some private guides have a set agenda that they follow and that's it -- not Abdul. He constantly said that he would like to how us this if its okay or we can tell him something different. He always was looking out for my son -- talking to him, racing with him -- genuine and sincere acts as I can easily spot people who are faking it. He is a guide that is independent -- no kick backs, referrals, or commissions with anyone -- for eating we wanted something genuine whether it was street food or restaurant. He had thought about me, a vegetarian, my picky 4 year old, and my carnivorous wife -- he picked the best food. Abdul makes you feel comfortable because you're not going to know how to negotiate, not know the language, how much to tip... For example, many times he would argue with the locals when he felt they were overcharging me, or he felt that the tip was too much -- who does that? If you truly want someone on your side then he is your guide. Let me say this, whatever you want to see he will show you with confidence or he will show you what he thinks is important -- complete personal tour. I wanted activities for my son -- delivered with restroom Breaks, ice cream shops, camel rides, monkeys, snakes, looking at different animals....2. Essaouira day tour -- amazing tour. I wanted to spend an hour on the beach so my son could play and Abdul said no problem. He made sure that we saw everything in a concise fashion and we were able to make my son happy. No one else would allow this much contouring. One last example: my son wanted to ride the camel on the beach and Abdul had a heated conversation with the owner as he wanted to charge us 300 MAD and Abdul said that was a total scam And he brought it down to 100 MAD. Abdul is passionate about being ethical as does not like it when locals try to overcharge or scam others. Look at his pricing for the tours -- it's well below especially in what he delivers.Basically, if you want someone who will tell you the ins and outs of Marrakech, make you feel you have a friend in the city, makes sure you are not being taken advantage of, can easily handle children as little as mine, please book Abdul early. You will not make a better choice and your vacations will be so much better.April 27 and 28th -- tours with Abdul"

And if you have been before you will still enjoy the tour as it shows you things you would never have found out just from walking around in your own. I have some fabulous photos to prove this! Abdul made us feel totally comfortable to ask any questions and never seemed tired despite having done the tour a million times over I'm sure! He will also guide you to the best eateries, handmade goods, and authentic oils and spices... thank you Abdul."

Traveling as a single woman I was a bit apprehensive in such a chaotic city. Abdul made me feel at ease as soon as the tour began. He spoke excellent english, is passionate about his city and has so much knowledge to share, an excellent photographer and is interested in tailoring the tour to exactly what I was interested in seeing and experiencing. He walked my pace and made sure I was seeing everything I had hoped to. We were able to interact with the locals, eat lunch from a street vendor (at my request- I wanted to try true authentic Moroccan street food. He is very careful to only take you to restaurants he trusts are clean and will not make you sick). On my second day we took a trip to the Atlas mountains where I was able to hike through Berber villages and have drinks at The Kasbah du Toubkal. The views were amazing. Book early because he is very popular!"

We recently got back from our trip to Morocco, and although we went to a lot of places we were able to see Marrakech the best because of the tour. I say it was a much needed tour because there is so much we would have missed if we had not done the tour. Our guide Abdul was kind, very knowledgeable, and very patient with us (we were traveling with our 2 1/2 year old). I really did enjoy this tour very much and was sad when it ended because I had so many more questions to ask. I really would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Marrakech. It is an awesome city but you need someone who knows there way around to truly let you appreciate it."

Our main objective was to broadly see the city and get our bearings so our next few days we could walk around and feel comfortable we would not get lost. Abdul took special care to ensure we knew where we were and what to look for if we felt unsafe. This was especially important because we were traveling with a two year old. He even gave us his cellphone should we get lost during the rest of our stay. During our tour he provided a great deal of historic knowledge and showed us many off the beaten path areas that were very fascinating and beautiful. Thanks for everything Abdul!"

Abdul came to our Riad and together we planned our day. Having ventured out by ourselves the day before, getting hopelessly lost and at the mercy of unscrupulous 'helpful' guides, we could not have made a better decision or choice when opting for the full day tour with Abdul. We took it at a pace to suit ourselves, I have mobility issues, which Abdul took in to account on our trip at all times. He is a courteous, intelligent, well-informed and friendly man who, by the end of our amazing day together, we felt as if we'd known for years! He took us on a wonderful tour of the hidden treasures of Marrakech, which definitely needed extensive local knowledge to find and access. Lunch was a truely Moroccan 'foody' experience, delicious and a meal never to forget. Abdul also arranged a trip in to The Atlas Mountains with his associate Mohan--another brilliant day with a another lovely young man and excellent tour guide. Our Mitsubushi vehicle was comfortable and very easy for me to access. We visited a Berber House for tea and again ate lunch in an unforgettable place.Both trips were great value for money. We saved time and energy because we knew exactly where we were going and became much more knowledgable about Marrakech , the place and its people. It is difficult to describe how lost one can get in the souks especially. For us a guide was essential, and a bonus was to have met the best two guides possible.Many thanks again chaps. We hope to see you again.100% recommended!PS If you do need a bathroom whilst out, these two guides always know how to get you to one!!"

The two experiences, obviously, were very different, but Abdul's wide ranging knowledge, sensitivity to our needs, useful advice and unfailing charm and good humour were common to both. The half day tour is highly recommended as early as possible in your stay as it provides a first-rate introduction to the city: we walked for about four hours at a leisurely pace through an intelligently planned itinerary which introduced us to so much about the city: its structure and the rationale behind it, the nature of a riad, the way of life, the commerce [in the legendary souks], bread baking customs, hammams, the Medersa, historial buildings.. and much more. As others have said, Abdul invites you to specify your areas of interest, and he will tailor your tour to suit.Our second trip was a day out in the High Atlas Mountains - again specially tailored for softies like us - though a more physically strenuous version was offered had we wanted it! We drove in a very comfortable Land Cruiser which cushioned the rugged off road trail we took in order to see more of the fabulous countryside and views. In Imlil, we had been offered the choice of a smart hotel lunch or home cooked food in a Berber house - we chose the latter and the hospitality, the tea tasting ceremony and the excellent food were all perfect. Definitely the right choice! A post lunch walk through chestnut, cherry and olive groves was fine for us - though a longer walk up the mountain was also offered. Throughout the day, we enjoyed chatting to Abdul about a wide range of aspects of Moroccan life and culture (and, indeed, English: he has a degree in English Language & Literature!) - he is immensely knowledgeable. The service provided by Abdul is first rate, flexible and we would highly recommend him: I cannot imagine anyone doing a better job."

After a slightly inauspicious start (we gave him the wrong address), Abdul showed himself to be an excellent guide- knowledgeable, interesting to listen to, patient and willing to discuss all the subjects and questions we directed towards him. He had an excellent command of the English language and showed a breadth and depth of knowledge about the city and its past. We ambled around the city seeing and discussing numerous interesting sights and had the opportunity to go to some places we would never have found or tried by ourselves. To be honest it felt more like walking around with a knowledgeable friend than a guide. His relaxed pace and style gave a unique contrast to the hectic pace of the city and I was amazed how we could just stand and chat about something whilst the city buzzed around us. He will pay attention to where you want to go and where you have already been, give good advice about how to buy and who to buy from (if you ask) and take you to great places to eat and drink, again, according to your needs. Although we had already spent a day looking around Marrakech our full day with Abdul built on that easily and gave us a different perspective. Invaluable. In fact, we dubbed him the Obi-Wan of Marrakech!P.S. The negative reviews for Marrakech guided day tours do not match our experience at all. In fact, one that looks like it is from a Londoner has very poor use of English and all the other reviews from that reviewer are from the same day with single word comments. They look like false reviews -treat with caution."

A new place to visit can seem worrying or unnerving meaning people miss out of some amazing things. From the very beginning our guide made us feel comfortable and safe offering reassurance and light hearten dialogue.Historical to geographical, religious to numerous, There was nothing our guide Abdul was not able to express. We were shown food production, riads, markets and restaurants. I particularly liked Abdul's approach offering choices and allowing our family to plan what we wanted to do during the trip, making sure we didn't miss anything. Some guides have told us what we are to do and where we must go, but with Abdul, we were able to spend a day seeing all there was to see, with a smile on our faces and a relaxed yet safe feeling to the day. All the we were promised was delivered from the peace and tranquility that the riad offered, to the satisfaction we got from interacting with the market traders, knowing our guide was not far away if we needed him. I think we asked a hundred questions, all of which received a smile and logical answer. Rarely have I felt so calm and content in such a busy place, thank you so much Abdul for making our families trip so amazing. So in my opinion, if you want to speak to someone who knows all there is about this beautiful town and country, and can help you to see and do all you could wish for...look no further than speaking with the person we had the pleasure of meeting, Abdul.Thank you so much and \"Our hearts remain frozen from all we have seen\".

He was able to answer all our questions. We were taken around Ben Youssef and Abdul explained in great detail the history of the buildings architecture and uses. He then took us to explore deep into the Souks, explaining how to best examine the quality the things for sales (i.e. tea pots). I could not recommend Abdul enough.

Abdul asked us what we would like to see and experience, however as there is so much going on that we opted for a sample of everything, which is exactly what Abdul delivered. Abdul guided us through the south of the Medina, visiting various places of interest whilst explaining how the different quarters began. We then traversed up through the Souks to a lovely Riad for lunch, after lunch we continued through the north finally ariving at the main square at 5.30pm.....a full day for an excellent price. If your going to Marrakech I would highly recommend booking a day tour with Abdul, at all times we felt safe and got no hassle from street sellers, nor did Abdul take us to any of his 'friends' souks for good price gifts.

He was extremely charming and courteous at all times. As he was already booked for the Monday, he arranged for a colleague, Ben, to take us to the Atlas mountains. Abdul arranged the transport and fantastic lunch at a Berber house for all 13 of us. Abdul himself came to the Riad to introduce Ben and ensure that all the arrangements with the bus etc were just perfect. Ben spoke excellent English too and gave us a fabulous day. Most of the party climbed and walked through the villages, I found I couldn't manage, so a mule was whistled up for me which was amazing. All our party said the High Atlas trip was a real highlight. We were welcomed by all the people we met and felt we got a real flavour of this part of Morrocco. Many thanks Abdul for all your organisation."

We didn\u2019t want a cultural tour of the palaces and museums as we were confident that we could take in as much as we wanted to by exploring these ourselves. We told him that instead we wanted to meet the local people and craftsman, not just the places accessible and discoverable by an inquisitive tourist. We had intended on booking him for a full day to accomplish this, he very kindly explained that it was not necessary to book him for the full day as a half day was enough for him to show us around and allow us to orientate ourselves. We booked him for the afternoon of our first full day in Marrakech and also booked him for a full day to see the Atlas mountains the day after. Abdul arrived at our riad at 2.30 and we had a quick discussion to confirm our preferences. He first took us the best way to reach Jemaa el Fna square through a busy alley buzzing with locals on foot, donkeys and mopeds. When we reached the square the heavens opened and we sheltered for about ten minutes under the cover of an orange sellers stall until the rain eased and we could continue. After explaining the important landmarks in and around the square he led us through some increasingly quieter alleyways to the northern area of the Medina where the most beautiful riads are to be found. We stopped in a lovely riad for drinks of fresh almond and orange juices. A few minutes later we were deep in the heart of the souks where tourists were very sparse. He managed to perfectly balance his observations for us with quiet times to let us take it all in. He stopped a street vendor to buy a bundle of sketchbooks and then took us to a local primary school to meet a teacher and her class. Kristi had said that she wanted to see a public bakery and he took us to one that I defy anyone to find on their own, it was tucked away, tiny and magical. As was the next stop to meet the men who keep the fires going for one of the public hamams. They made mint tea for us and one of them sang a song whilst playing some strange stringed instrument, wonderful characters, kind, gentle and very funny. We finished our tour back at the square as we had requested so that we could experience the bustle in the early evening. The following day Abdul and his driver picked us up in a 4-wheel drive to go to a village in the Atlas Mountains. On the way it was very cloudy and as we got higher it was either very foggy or we were in dense cloud, visibility was about 20 feet but the driver was very safe. Abdul remained cheerful and confident saying that it would clear soon. We stopped for mint tea with a local Berber family before continuing through the mist. Finally it cleared and travelled through beautiful valleys of fruit and walnut trees before reaching our destination. Abdul gave us the option of taking lunch at the Kasbah Du Toubkal or to visit a family in a Berber village, we opted for the latter and reached the house after a short trek. We were greeted by a Berber called Lahcen who led us to his balcony overlooking Mount Toubkal. He brought us dates and almonds and encouraged us to make mint tea under his guidance. After a tour of his house (which he hopes to make into a guest house called Imlil Authentic Toubkal Lodge later this year), Lahcen brought us the most incredible lunch of Moroccan salad, a superb and authentic lamb tagine with preserved lemons, onions and prunes and a couscous and vegetable tagine which we all shared. Abdul had already explained that a 400 Dirham contribution for the meal would be ample but we tipped an extra 100. It was easily the best food that we had on our holiday. After saying our thanks and goodbyes we elected the \u201cmedium\u201d length walk to see the Kasbah and were astonished to be greeted by Lahcen who had taken a short cut to his second job! After a drink we made our way back to Marrakech and the riad. We said our thanks and goodbyes to Abdul, a warm and gentle man without who our experience in Marrakech would not have been the same. I must say that we travel widely and often but very rarely take any sort of a tour. Abdul absolutely made our holiday in Marrakech and we thoroughly recommend him, we saw things that we would never had without his local knowledge. On a final note, he never, ever, gave any hint that we should visit any shops or buy from traders and I would view any comments to the contrary with great scepticism."

After reading wonderful reviews I contacted Abdul and he got back to me straight away, the prices were so reasonable that we booked a 1/2 tour. We met Abdul by the Koutoubia at 9.30am and he put us at ease straight away, he was so knowledgeable and totally flexible as to what we wanted to see. It was so nice seeing Marrakech with a guide, Abdul knew so much about the city and guided us around the souks, the medina and the derbs, all while giving us the history of the city. While walking through the souks, one of the shopkeepers tried to get us in, but Abdul very kindly told him were weren't interested, which was such a relief as the shopkeepers can be VERY persuasive. At no time did we feel he was taking us to any shops, which was good as we just wanted to walk through. At the end of our tour, Abdul very kindly said we could contact him should we have any further questions - which I thought was such a friendly gesture. I would without hesistation use Abdul again for another tour if I head back to Morocco, and also recommmend his Guided Tours to friends and family. Thank you Abdul for making our start in Morocco so enjoyable. Natalie and Liz"

It was a great idea as the medina was initially quite confusing with its many lanes. Abdul is a great guide who tailored the tour according to my interests and did not rush the tour. I even called him the next day when I wanted to back to a specific part of the medina but couldn't remember how to get there and he was kind enough to give us directions and even to send a text to make sure we are ok.The tour is 45 Euros and definitely worthwhile especially if it is your first time to Marrakech."

We decided to contact Abdul before going to Marrakech, as he had so many good reviews on tripadvisor....and he certainly didn't disappoint! A gentle, friendly man who has a lovely manner about him and introduces Marrakech to you in an almost 'organic' way. It's a very hectic place and perhaps even a little intimidating if you've never been to somewhere as busy, but because we had our tour with Abdul the first day of our visit, we were made to feel very confident about exploring the city further on our own, once our tour with Abdul had finished. He didn't rush us, and was very happy to answer our many questions in an informative, engaging way.Highly recommended - and we would definitely recommend trying to do a tour with him right at the start of your stay if you've not been before. For one thing, he really made sure we understood how to get back to our Riad (not easy within the Medina as the little lanes can be confusing).Thanks Abdul, we greatly enjoyed your tour."

All the excellent reviews on here are fully justified.Having arrived late at night the tour was arranged for our first morning. Marrakech is an overwhelming, frantic city and more than anything Abdul's tour help us to acclimatise and become familiar with our surroundings. One of the advantages is that the tour is very flexible and Abdul will fit the tour to your requirements. We wanted a basic grounding so that we could orientate ourselves in the city and this was more than delivered.Abdul proved to be an excellent guide and great company. He seems to know everyone in the city and we thoroughly enjoyed our tour. As well as pointing out the main sites he took us into the souks and we visited places we wouldn't have discovered ourselves. He also advised us on etiquette and pointed out a variety of places to eat at our request. His English is excellent and there was no hard sell of any stalls or shops so it was easy to relax and feel comfortable in his company. It's very good value and a much better way of seeing the city than with a large tour group. We would certainly seek him out again if we returned and can highly recommend him to everyone."

Abdul speaks perfect English, and educated us in the history of the city, as well as providing a great insight into day-to-day life in Marrakech which we wouldn't have seen if we hadn't opted to go on this tour. He is very knowledgeable and genuine in his explanations; I say this because we heard another tour guide talking nonsense to a tourist at one of the places we visited. My only criticism is that during the very last part of the tour, which was in the Souks, he was walking a bit ahead of us and not really saying much. I believe this was to let us take in the sights and sounds but we spent plenty of time by ourselves in the Souk in any case. Overall a great tour, very personal and a great way to get an introduction to Marrakech!"

His English is refined and his manner is friendly and relaxed. We found this so much better than having trail round in a large tour group. He let us know which places would be better to visit on our own after the tour such as the gardens and museums to allow us to make the most of the time with him. One thing to note is that Abdul is clearly in demand as for the last part of the tour when we were wandering through the souk he picked up a number of calls on his phone (maybe sorting other tours?) which was a bit frustrating when we paid for his time. Nevertheless, this is a minor point of what was overall a great tour."

We booked Abdul for a full day tour of Marrakech as we didn't want to be in a large tour group and really wanted to get away from the usual tourist route. So pleased we decided to go with Adul as he totally tailor made the trip to what we wanted to do.We visited the Palace, Saadian tombs, Ben Youseff and Museum and more interestingly for me the jewish quarter, spice markets and souks. It was my second time in Marrakech and I loved seeing parts of it I just wouldn't of without Abdul. I think the most interesting part of the tour was having coffee and simply discussing the culture, it was fascinating to have an open and honest conversation about the traditions and about aspects of the culture you would normally never have a chance to discuss. I feel I have come away with a better understanding of the Muslim religion and culture, and one that you simply wouldn't get doing a tour through a hotel rep or in a large group.I would thoughrally reccommend doing a tour with Abdul - I would also say do the full day as you will see so much more and is 100% worth the money - you won;t regret it and will learn and see so much"

We visited the Tombs, Palace, Museum, Jewish quarter, Souks for spices, the university, botantical garden and also visited a local Hammas and bakery. Abdul is very willing to take pictures of our experiences on the trip, which was great. The photos were good too.We ate a local lunch of Beef Tagina and clay baked lamb. At my request we also visited a local patisserie for traditional treats.It is possible to ask to include an authentic lunch at the local Hammas, and to also attend the local Hammas. Ask!We did have to pay for a taxi, all entry fees and lunch - in all no more than 240dhrs. I felt I had been educated well in understanding a snapshot of Marrakech past and present, its communities and way of life. I saw everything I wanted to, and all at my pace.

Marrakech is a vibrant, bustling city with endless windy roads and alleyways and surprises hidden behind every corner. But to some tourists it can be perceived as daunting and even a little threatening. We travelled with a tour operator but didn\u2019t really fancy their standard tours with around 30 people, attracting negative attention wherever they go. We wanted to see the real Marrakech, learn about the history and the way of life.So, after doing some research we settled on Marrakech Guided Tours. I contacted them and had a very swift response from a guide called Abdul, who was very polite and helpful and even arranged to meet us at our hotel. Abdul arrived on time and was very polite and spoke excellent English.We started our tour at the Koutoubia Mosque and Minaret where we were given a fascinating lecture on its history and the history of Marrakech. You can specify what you want to do and see, but we just wanted a general introduction to the city and advised Abdul to show us what he felt was significant.We made our way through streets full of locals and learned all about the history, architecture and the culture \u2013 even stopping at a local school and bakery. We visited a museum and the former university (costs extra), then we visited the Caf\u00e9 de Epices where we sat and enjoyed the views other a smaller market square.The whole time Abdul was friendly, helpful, polite and informative. When we pressed him for recommendations of where to buy things, he was reluctant to advise, a sign that he was trustworthy, but did provide some useful tips on where the locals shop. He offered to take pictures of the two of us, which was really nice, as I'm not very good with a camera it means there are usually more pictures of me than my girlfriend. Abdul spent several hours with us and even arranged a taxi for us to go back to the hotel (at an extra cost of about \u00a312 - evening rates)."

I tried, in vain to book a last minute tour with Abdul from Marrakech Guided Day Tours (I emailed on the Wednesday for a Saturday tour!). Abdul was already booked for that day, but fortunately he put me in contact with Khalid Amor, another Marrakech Guided Day Tours guide who (as well as being great friends with him) was a colleague of Abdul's. Fortunately for us this proved to be a most auspicious recommendation! Khalid promptly emailed me back to let me know that he was available to take us on a guided tour of the Medina. Khalid arrived promptly at our wonderful Palais Sebban and we discussed where we would like to go for the day....we just asked him to show us the real Marrakech...map out, we were on our way. To say this was a superb day would be an understatement. Khalid was superb - showing us all those places that would normally be inaccessible to a weekend tourist. We visited a locals' fruit market which was tucked down some winding alleys which was fabulous - Khalid treated us to some just picked oranges which were much appreciated (we were walking miles!). We visited everywhere from the backstreet artisan courtyards to the leather auction, from the metalwork district to the stunningly beautiful Bahia Palace, from the winding streets of the Jewish quarter to the atmospheric and mind-blowing souks. One of the most enjoyable parts of the day was sharing lunch with Khalid in his 'local' cafe in the souk - fantastic kebabs, chickpeas and lentil broth - stunning food with amazing company. Khalid made what was a fabulous long weekend in Marrakech even more special - he even arrived at our hotel on the Sunday with a birthday present for me which was so heartwarming. If you want to see the real Marrakech with a real gentleman with a passion for his home town and country and a wealth of knowledge - please look no further thank booking with this fantastic pair of guides. (We bumped into Abdul twice which was an absolute pleasure - he greeted us like old friends - and it was clear that he and Khalid were kindred spirits with a passion for their work). Khalid spent from 9am-4pm on that Saturday and we felt like we were saying goodbye to an old friend when he left. We will certainly be back and we will certainly be booking another tour! Money well spent and highly recommended."

It's easy to get lost in Marrakesh and our riad was south of the medina and though beautiful once we were through the front door, it was situated in what looked as though in was not in the best of areas. Abdul met us at our riad at 9.30 as arranged, and showed us the best way to reach the Jemma El Fnaa square which is the heart of Marrakesh. We needn't have worried, it was all quite straightforward once we knew.Abdul will tailor your tour to your particular interest. Whilst we were interested to find out lots about Marrakesh, we are particular interested in the food. Abdul took us to a bakery and showed us where all the local women take their bread to be baked - it was amazing to see all the very similar loaves that had been/were waiting to be baked - the baker knew whose was whose though the looked the same to us!He showed us a boiler room for one of the hammams where a man was continually stoking a fire with wood shavings which was heating the water. Local people brought their tangias (cooking pots - not tagines), a Morrocan dish containing meat and vegetables which he cooked for hours in the resulting ash from the ovens. The man then kindly played us a little Morrocan music on an instrument we have never seen before! Both these visits were particularly interesting and we would never have seen these without Abdul. He also took us around the souks - pointed out the spices, the sheeps heads (we passed on them), talked about the herbs and other dishes, dried fruits, the stalls that spring up in the square every evening cooking all sorts of food etc. as well us showing us some of the Marrakesh architecture and talking about the Muslim faith and the mosques and general way of life for Morrocans.We would recommend Abdul - especially if it is your first visit to Marrakesh!"

While I cannot comment on the trip directly as I wasn't there I am incrediably enthusuastic that people realise how easy this company was to deal with and they provided everything they promised in my dialog with them. Thanks to Abdul for making my parents holiday more special and I look forward to a tour with the company when my partner and I eventually get to Marrakech."

This year we didn't spend our Christmas at home, we were eager to find something different, something not red, white and green, something that reminded us of the humanity behind the festivity and not the capitalism around it. We decided to spend our Christmas in a place where there is no Christmas. We spent it in Marrakech.Abdul was our generous guide there, showed us all the best views, we discovered the food not served at fancy restaurants, the richness of his culture, and all the wonderful things the Medina has to offer. We had the best of times.However, through his work, I learned who the real Abdul is, what he has for lunch, what his wife thinks of a happy marriage, what he's wishes are for himself and his family\u2019s future, what his religion means to him... Trough his work he was able to give me a piece of his soul. To me, art means connecting with people, and therefore, Abdul is an artist in his own right.This is what I take home for Christmas, the touch of an artist, his people and his city."

There were a few things we ran out of time on but he helped to orientate us so we saw those things the following day. He gives great advice for us first timers and also provided suggestions that we welcomed with open arms - like the mishwi restaurant hidden near the square - absolutely worth it!A highly recommended tour guide in our opinion.Thank you Abdul!"

After reading other reviews on this site, we concluded that Abdul must be special and so decided to ask him to orient us to Marrakech during our first morning. The email communication was easy, prompt, and clear, and the resultant tour was as advertised. He asked us what we wanted, and then delivered. After staying in Marrakech for 9 days, in hindsight the tour was an excellent introduction to many aspects. He taught us much about the history and culture of the region. After the tour, we were readily able to navigate on our own, and comfortable going anywhere. He was full of advice about what to do during our stay. He was willing to stop where we wanted and take as much time as we needed. Explanations were complete and clear; he is easy to talk to. Unlike other guides, he never steered us to any merchant or store; in fact, he took pains to avoid favoring any.The only problem with Abdul, as he told us, is that his reputation as a guide is becoming so strong that he may be 100% obligated during busy times. This is a good problem to have: book early -- and you won't be disappointed."

After earlier excellent reviews I booked Abdul for a half day tour on the 26th December. Abdul asked what our interests were by mail and we indicated we would be most interested by seeing the craftsmen of the souks at work and seeing how they lived their lives. Abdul began his tour with a little bit of the history of the establishment of Marrakech a thousand years ago, then illustrated how this history has shaped how the city and souks, and neighbourhoods were constructed. We saw a leather hide market, metal workers at work, shoe makers and the communal bakeries. All done attentively listening to us and our thoughts and giving us his personal insights into his city. Marrakech is confusing, noisy and shocking in parts to the Western eye, but Abdul made us feel safe and there was no time wasted getting lost in the souks or trying to avoid the guys who hassle you to buy their wares or services. I would recommend Abdul without hesitation. Thanks again!"

Over the years, we have travelled extensively and enjoyed getting to know the people and places we visit. Not being fluent in French or Arabic, I chose to engage a knowledgeable local english speaking guide to help us. Upon reading the reviews, I engaged Abdul to show us his city. It proved to be the best decision I made. He is an intelligent, courteous and attentive guide who knows much about the city\u2019s people and but how Morocco has evolved. He patiently answered our questions and gave us a better understanding of the daily lives of the people. Besides all the \u2018must see\u2019 tourist places, Abdul showed us sights that we would have missed. So we were able to relate everyday activities with what we had learned. We passed through myriads of passages, old and new, encountered local markets and caught glimpses of craftsmen focused on their work.We began our tour in the southern part of the Medina, walked to the Kasbah and onto the Mellah. We meandered towards the Medersa and through souks until we finally reached Jemaa el Fna. Having soaked up the atmosphere there, we took a caleche and rode to Jardin Marjorelle. The garden was a delightfully tranquil place and a lovely way to end our day with Abdul.Watching Abdul interacting with his countrymen showed us how one should behave. We were never harried by unsolicited sellers or unnecessary distractions. He was punctual and as I had arranged, met us at our hotel on the edge of the Palmeraie. Thank you Abdul for making it a most enjoyable experience for my son and I."

Let me start with the conclusion: after a whole day guided tour with Abdul you're really ready to conquer this wonderful city all by your own. The method? Walking around with Abdul in Mellah, Kasbah, Mouassine and other of the colourful but not so touristic quarters of Marrakech while you listen to his intelligent and knowledgeable presentation of what you are seeing you step by step understands the city, the atmosphere and its people. When you're witnessing Abdul's polite and respectful greetings of the tradesmen in the souks you understand that the sometimes agressive rejection that you were ready to show towards eager Morrocans is not the right way. Show people respect and they will respect you. This attitude that we learnt by Abdul we tried to perform the rest of our holiday and it worked. So besides all the factual information you get from Abdul you also get a peep into the soul of Marrakech and its people."

There were so many things on my \"must-see\" list and I only had 2 days to see it. I started reading about guides when I came across Abdul Aissaoui Marrakech Guided Tours and immediately checked to see if he had any reviews. Every one of them was a 5 star rating. I emailed him and we booked a 2 hour night tour (with my husband) to the Jemaa el-fnaa for some local fair and then a full day tour the next day starting at 9am He was prompt and professional right from the get-go. We started our walk from the Hotel Sofitel and already he was giving us some history of the city. We ate in the center square, had a nice meal, some local tea and he made the whole experience so easy. He helped us order and made sure we tried some new foods native to Morocco. The next morning he arrive to the hotel and again...made me feel at ease. He knew so much about the history of the city and kept saying, \"I hope to show you everything...I want to be sure you see all that I have planned for you.\" And we did!! I could spend all day trying to remember it all...I don't think we missed anything (except for the gardens which he offered to show me but I was too tired). Each stop was filled with more information and he even took me to a beautiful cafe (inside a riad) to the rooftop to enjoy the sun and quiet. Don't allow the concierge to book your guide for you. You'll be disappointed. Our friends ended up shopping all day and learned nothing of the rich history of this region. I could go on and on but needless to say, I left there feeling like a made a new friend....and probably did. He is excellent at what he does and it comes off as effortless. You will be very pleased with Abdul as your guide."

We couldn't have been more pleased. He is a trained and certified guide with a huge breadth of knowledge about his country and his countrymen. Although we enjoyed the main sights in the three areas where he offers tours, the medina, the Atlas Mountains and the Atlantic coast village of Essaouri, it was the special, unique parts of our trips that we loved the most. We visited a local bakery where women of the medina bring their dough to be baked in the wood-fired oven every day. We walked in the old Jewish quarter in the evening. We had tea and fresh bread and honey with a Berber family in a small rural village and we visited the weekly market in a small town on the way to the coast where we were the only tourists. Abdul told us a tremendous amount about Moroccan culture and it's treasures - the people, the crafts, the food, the scenery, the history. He was very generous with his time, so we never felt rushed. He adjusted his pace and the itinerary to our preferences. We had told him a little about our likes and dislikes before we arrived and he understood them perfectly and tailored our tours to accomodate them - thus we were never pressured to shop, we did not spend endless hours in palaces and museums, but had active days and not only the evening chaos of the Djemma el-Fna, but also visited lovely gardens and galleries, saw craftsmen at work, people going on with the chores of daily life, goats in trees and women grinding argan nuts into precious oil. He gently deflected the occasionally pushy vendors, and carefully and sensitively guided us in appreciating the role that the Muslim faith plays in the everyday lives of the people of Morocco. It was a wonderful experience to get to know this intelligent, curious, thoughtful, and gentle man who truly enjoys his work and loves his country and its people. I would recommend him without hesitation to visitors of all ages and all interests including families. We learned a tremendous amount and are curious to know even more when we return and ask him once again to be our guide."

We visited a baker and hamam (but no to bath, but to see men who is heating). We could also see how people play Gwana music. Naturally you could not experience those part without having guide.Abdul is calm, modest and comfortable person, speaks very clear English.

I was with my 20 year old daughter and two of her friends.We had an amazing time thanks to Abdul. He took us to places in the Medina that we would have never known about like the bread maker for families in the medina, a tour of a school of spices.He kept all the merchants at bay , so we never felt harassed during our shopping. It was truly a wonderful experience. our only regret is that we were there for such a short time. But we will definitely be back to spend more time in Marrakech with our wonderful guide and friend Abdul."

If he's already booked we really have no one else to recommend.\" We'll second all the positive things said in other reviews after our morning with him, but add that he was more than willing to find places for a few minutes' resting or bio-breaks and other necessities that just aren't apparent and available to the self-guided. We learned much about the history and architecture, our preferred topics, but learned even more about the culture of the Moroccan people, characteristics of Islam in normal practice, and many other topics that really enriched our visit to this fascinating country. Hire Abdul, tell him about your interests. Ask him a lot of questions. You'll have a wonderful day."

            "review": "Excellent Experience! Highly Recommended!. We booked Marrakech Guided Tours (Abdul) through our Riad as they ensured us that Abdul is the best of the best as far as tour guides in Marrakesh. We were nervous about exploring the Medina and Marrakech on our own for the first day, so being able to take a tour with Abdul was exactly what we were looking for and more. The minute we met Abdul, we got a great vibe from him and his English is excellent. He asked us what we were interested in seeing/not seeing and he took us around the city based on this - which was nice as neither me nor my friend really cared to see too many museums. While on our tour with Abdul, we learned about the history of Marrakech, stories behind specific sites, personal stories from him about growing up in Marrakech - it was perfect! We had such a great day on the tour, that we hired Abdul again for the next day and we toured Majorelle and Menera Gardens which was really great. Another important thing to note, he never once (on either day) tried to take us into any stores so that he could get commission on what we bought. Apparently, this is very common with tour guides in Marrakech, but not at all the case with Abdul. All in all, it is definitely worth spending the extra $$ to have such a wonderful, knowledgable and trustworthy tour guide like Abdul. What a wonderful experience!"

When we booked a guide through our Riad, we did not expect to find someone as fantastic as Abdul! Abdul speaks absolutely excellent English, and he is charming, good humoured, professional, intelligent, and courteous \u2013 it was a real pleasure to have his company. We were so pleased after our first day with him that we immediately booked him for a second full day! The first thing that Abdul asked us was what our interests were and what we wanted to do and see. The great thing was that as well as being able to see and experience everything we hoped for, Abdul also took us to some amazing places that we would never have been able to find on our own. It was very helpful to get aquainted with the layout of the medina with a guide before we ventured out on our own.Abdul is extremely knowledgeable about the history and culture of Marrakech and Morocco and we were fascinated by his commentary as we visited many historical sites and beautiful buildings in the medina. We were delighted that through Abdul we were able to visit traditional bakers, musicians, leather craftsman, and stucco carvers and see them in action. It was a great experience to be able to meet some of the locals. My partner is very interested in music and he was thrilled to have the opportunity to play a traditional Moroccan stringed instrument. Abdul also helped him find some great CDs of Moroccan musicians.We had read in our 'Lonely planet' guide book that sometimes tourists can have difficulties with shopping in the markets of Marrakech, but Abdul made it a pleasure, with no hassles, and no pressure. He even carried my shopping bags! When we told Abdul what we wanted to buy, he helped us find the best quality authentic items for very reasonable prices. My favourite souvenir from our trip to the markets was a beautiful traditional Moroccan leather pouffe. We were able to watch the craftsman hand-stitching the leather pieces together - very fascinating! At the end of each day I relax and put my feet up on our beautiful pouffe, and I am always reminded of Marrakech! Abdul was an excellent guide in all respects. We can thank him for some great memories of our time in Morocco and we are very pleased to keep in touch with him on our return home. We would highly recommend his services to anyone visiting Marrakech. Our guided tours with Abdul were the highlight of our time in this beautiful city."

My partner fell shortly into the ride , but Mohammed was excellent and made sure everything was ok. I would like to add that the fall was nothing todo with the company but some local workmen. The ride out to scorpion city was a good pace and Mohammed kept on checking with us on the pace to ensure we was ok. As we got to scorpion city the bike that my partner was on had a problem with the rear derailleur. (Result of the fall) Mohammed promptly arranged a reserve bike to be brought to our location and made sure we was hydrated and looked after whilst waiting. He was so apologetic and kept talking with us about the UK and about the local area.We then turned back around and headed back to Marrakesh after some photos. The ride back was fast paced but again Mohammed ensured the pace was good and we made stops to top up on water.The roads Don't be put off by the roads in Marrakesh. The roads we went on was excellent and I would say better than back home in the U.K. The majority of drivers give you distance and we didn't have any issues. Felt safe 99% of the time. I think a lot of this was down to Mohammed and his guiding skills too. If you can ride roads in the UK then you can ride in Marrakesh. I was considering going out alone later if I had more time.Mohammed - our guideMohammed is a real credit to the company. He is knowledgable and very fit. You can see he loves what he does and his passion for this job and cycling makes sure his clients are treated well. He also spent time setting up my bike as I had my own pedals and equipment. Mohammed is a genuine honest guy and if you are lucky to get him you will have an excellent trip."

My boyfriend, who is an advanced cyclist, appreciated being able to ride with someone who was enthusiatic as he was, whilst I appreciated how he looked out for me on the roads, as I am not as advanced. I was a bit uncertain riding on the Moroccan roads but shouldn't have been with a guide. We rode approx. 30km to Scorpion City on a slight incline, then stopped at a rooftop cafe with a great view of the Atlas mountains. Mohammad couldn't do enough for us, getting us tea, water, food. After, we rode back on an exciting decline back into Marrakech. I would thoroughly recommend this as a tour option, much better than sitting on a sweaty coach!"

Stunning. We've been on many tours, both off the beaten track and the old classics through Europe. I will never forget this. Ever. Riding from around 2200 metres, we got to see the real Morocco; the real mountains. We started at the snow line and plunged through many streams, Berber villages and stunning landscapes. Technically, it wasn't hard, unless you mixed up the front and back brakes. Physically, I'd bring some food to ensure you don't run out of energy. If you have some fitness and/or bikeawareness everything should be ok. The tour guide was also great. Very knowledgeable of the local area."

Easy email exchange, good info on the website and so an easy decision was madeCome the day we were picked up by Mohammed and the driver, lots of smiles and lots of confidence garnered (especially for my wife). No favours from the weather but after driving up quite an 'interesting' road in the Atlas we broke through the cloud to some just amazing views. The ride itself was perfect, a gentle descent on a wide mountain track winding its way around the contour lines. Mohammed was also perfect, inspiring confidence in my Wife and enjoying watching our daughter take on the challenge. 18km later and we all had a great time, to be followed by a really nice authentic lunch on the way home. To get ready for the following day we went via the shop to fit my pedals to a road bike for my ride the following morning. We were treated to mint tea and cake ...lovely!Following day Mohammed and I had a complete blast out of Marrakech to the foothills of the Atlas and back. 80km of chasing gas trucks, scooters and anything else we could get a little help from. Brilliant fun and included a little coffee and cake stop at Scorpion City.What I am trying to say here is that the same company and the same guide delivered a challenging yet confidence inspiring ride for my Wife and Daughter and the following day a hair raising charge for me. Perfect understanding of what was wanted and needed on both daysI will be going again, my family will be going again and I strongly urge you to give it a try for a really different, safe, fun and memorable way to experience Marrakech and its surroundings.Brilliant all roundRobin"

Dear fellow trip advisors - to my shame, I don't contribute much to this community with reviews, the places I visit have to be exceptionally good, or poor for me to share my experiences, but this was a Very good one, and I would love to share the experience. I had the pleasure of having this tour with my mate Dave from the UK. We wanted to cycle in morocco, so I found this place on the Internet, and went to visit them back at the end of March on a previous trip, just to suss them out. I already have a bike in morocco, but we needed to hire a bike for Dave and arrange some guided tours. They are a family owned business, and I met Farouq, who is the older brother. I fell in love ( metaphorically) straight away! Apart from having a fantastic array of bikes and a first class mechanic, Farouq completely understood what I was about, and exactly what I wanted. For anybody concerned about this place being for youngsters who want the \"extreme\" cycling experience, let me tell you, they cater very nicely for all riders. The most extreme thing about me & Dave is our eating habits! At first I was a little skeptical about cycling through Marrakech, as I've been here before, and the traffic at times can be absolutely bonkers, but I needn't have worried, because our guide, Mohammed expertly and safely wove us through the traffic and tightly packed streets. Mohammed took us through the Kasbah, wound through the quieter city streets to their favourite spice shop / natural pharmacy, where we were shown remedies for virtually every ailment you could think of. We visited Koutoubia mosque, and the big square, where Mohammed bought us an amazing fresh orange juice. Wow, one of the very best I have ever had! We also wanted something a little different with our tour, so following the standard tour we had a custom ride through the old city streets, with tightly winding passages and interesting architecture. We never would have ventured down here alone! We completed our tour with a really lovely lunch. Not your usual tourist fare, but in a small local restaurant, with locals eating there. Obviously we weren't eating in the lap of luxury, but the quality of the food was far superior to the usual tourist traps. To make this even more of a challenge, I wanted fish, and Dave is a veggie, so Mohammed had to find a suitable restaurant. We're a pair of middle aged professional fat blokes, who appreciate our food, and cycle to help control our eating habit - That's why Mohammed took us there! We really enjoyed this tour, so much so, that we booked another in a couple of days time to cycle to Essouira on the coast. This was a fully supported tour - see seperate review. So, my advice to you my fellow trip advisors, is to research the city a little before you come, and if you want something a little different , then plan it with the team from Axs. They really are a fantastic bunch if guys and deserve all the help they can get! Cycling advice, well you don't need to be super fit for this trip, as the city is flat, but you do need to be confident in traffic. Hope this helps! Regards to you allHassen"

Although AXS didn't get any new bikes delivered that day - the boss made some calls to various places in Morocco and ended up getting the two of us two brand new giant bike boxes in accordance with a partner of his in Casablanca! Dude, he saved our journey back home - \"Next time guys, call me early and I will arrange some bus to drive our boxes from our startline to the finishing airport!\" that`s how he left off!!! Thank you sooooo much and we will come back for sure. For every cyclist entering Morocco this place is a must-go-to!"

I took the Palmery tour which wasn't at all taxing but I wasn't looking for a work out! What it did include though was the charming company of Mohammed who ensured that I was quite comfortable with my bike (I was and still was by the end of the 2-hour tour!) and then proceeded to give me not only the history of the area as we cycled along (I was a tour of one person!) but also stopped at all the best places to take photographs and was happy to make sure that I featured in many of them by taking the camera and snapping away (I had nicknamed him David Bailey by the end of the tour!). He encouraged me to get off the bike when we saw the camels - my favourite sight being a mother and her very young baby and again encouraged me to take lots of photographs. I experienced the peace and tranquility of the area - a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the Medina area where we were staying, saw the contrast of the sumptuous new hotels and residences that have been built next to the tiny, makeshift but proud homes of the local people sheltering their families, goats, cats, dogs and even cows! How Mohammed is able to navigate the dusty, arid tracks through the palm groves that carpet the area, is a mystery itself and his timing of ensuring that we were in the best place for sunset photographs was immaculate! Mohammed kept me entertained the entire time with stories not only of the area but also we talked about religion, family, politics, Morrocan humour - I felt that I was definitely leaving Marrakech with a far better understanding of the area and that it was an absolute treat that I think many visitors to Marrakech would simply bypass.If you are wondering what to wear, I was very comfortable in a pair of cut off jeans, trainers and shirt. I left my bag in the company car and just took my camera. A bottle of water was thoughtfully provided.I definitely intend to return in the not too distant future and I definitely intend to take another of the tours on offer. I might even go for a work out next time!!"

We like biking so looked for companies doing such tours were so lucky to find Argansport. We contacted them by email and from the beginning, from their answers we found out this was going to be something special.We were picked up at our Riad by the two Mohameds. Is is about hours drive and they told us a lot about the tour and a lot about Morocco, stories and jokes. Things you would not pick up by just staying in town. It is impossible not to like those two great guys.We did the Enter the Atlas tour and for sure everyone who knows how to bicycle will be able to do it. The landscape we went through was just mind blowing and we did a lot of stops for pictures and them telling us about the region. The ride down took about 2,5 hours and there was lunch waiting by the river close to Asni. After lunch there was one hours driving back to our riad going through some breathtaking landscape.We did the tour in the middle of March and it was a bit cold in the mountain. Something we would liked to have known about beforehand.For those reading these lines do not hesitate doing this tour (or others) with ABX-Bike."

This year when we returned we immediately contacted them for suggestions on what we should try this year. We chose the Easing down the Atlas and a 2nd day customized ride in the desert. I can't say enough how much we enjoyed each of these tours. Our guide, Mohammed Ghourdmani, was patient when I was uncomfortable easing downhill and got me on my way easily. The 2nd day was customized--we knew we wanted to put on some miles but it was also our first time riding outside this season. Somehow he coaxed 70km out of us and we had a ball. He knew just where to stop for breaks, and magnificent lunches. We felt blessed to have someone who explained the history and customs not from a script but someone who genuinely is proud to show us his town. We are already asked them to plan out a trip from Marrakech to Essaouira for us in the fall. I can't imagine a visit to Marrakech without a bike tour of some type with this group.P.S. Really high quality bikes."

A chance meeting in the Sahara desert with owner, Samira Kovach planted the seed and on my return to Marrakech I decided to try the 75km 'Berber Loop' on a high spec, full carbon fibre 'Giant' road bike (AXS is the Giant North Africa distributor I later learned). I was promptly collected from my riad at the agreed time in a comfortable 4 x 4 and, accompanied at all times by this support vehicle, began the ride guided by a former Morocco national road bike champion. We climbed and climbed a winding road further and further into the snow-capped Atlas mountains, leaving the Pink City in its veil of mystical dust and ascended into the crystalline purity of its gigantic neighbours. The closer we got to the summit, the further back in time we went as we became witness to women dressed in technicolor traditional hand woven dresses tending to their daily duties while bright-eyed children\u00a0 momentarily ran with us through their unspoilt villages. This was the pastoral innocence akin to Blake's pre-industrial England; Morocco's very own 'Jerusalem'. It was in these ephiphanous moments that my addiction was born, committing me to further indulgences. And so, in the following days and weeks I went on the 360 MTB tour which involved 70kms of pure off-road descent on full suspension, Giant mountain bikes during which we happened upon the beautiful lyricism of Friday's call to prayer and the total view of the village that was bathed in it.I did the 'Taste Tour' during which I was taken to local herbalists, street food vendors and tiny, beat-up restaurants that, any other time, I would've walked straight past. Yet inexperienced probably the best tagine I have ever had and what must have been the best pomegranate in the world.A high Atlas mountain trek followed next in the still-green foothills of Imlil shadowed by the white mass of Toubkal looming ominously over us. As we ascended we eventually hit a ridge when, seemingly from nowhere, a flock of hundreds and hundreds of black crows swooped and wheeled over us, parting in two as they flew either side of us. It was pure magic and left us mute for several minutes. We descended into gullies and past a makeshift football pitch in what must be one of the most glorious locations in the world. As we approached civilisation we then came upon a group of youths who were singing as one whilst collecting bits of plastic that were strewn about their village! What a wonderful thing to stumble upon and to see! Indeed it was so inspiring that I've since head that AXS has added an eco green pristine adventure tour where clients can do exactly this should they desire. Wonderful.I went on several other tours with Argan AXS including a surf/Paradise Valley tour, a trek where we ate with this lovely old Berber couple in the mountains after enjoying their traditional hamman and a short waterfall tour.This company has all the professionalism and expertise one could wish for. More importantly it has the idea knowledge to the true secrets of Morocco and these were revealed each and everytime I went on a tour with it. I could not recommend Argan AXS highly enough and am very much looking forward to my next trip with will see me taking part in its Atlas Etap riad cycling event and Toubkal trekking tour where I hope to scale Morocco's tallest peak. I can't wait."

Traffic stops for bikes, so I was told and they do. Over the 2 and half hours we never stopped laughing and talking. We went and saw some brilliant sights, we got to visit a spice shop in the mellah area, this comes highly recommended, they are very insightful and live talking to you. The spices are amazing. We also we went for fresh orange juice in the jemal el FINA. This was very refreshing. We could stop whenever we wanted to take photos or have a res, Mohammed was full of information and stories, his English is very good and was an absolute pleasure to spend a morning with. If and when we return to Marrakech we Weill bge back to try the Atlas mountain tour. Thank you guys for an amazing trip"

Furthermore we were given a 5 minute demo to ensure we had a good understanding of the bikes. Ready with water, Mohammed guided us along dirt tracks through villages with great vistas. The only things to watch out for were sheep and donkeys. After about an hour, we met up with Hamoud for snacks and new bottles of water. We then cyclded on the road for a bit (or it could have been before our break) where Mo was great at watching out for the rare car or motorbike (felt safe the entire trip). We then met Hamoud again for more water before continuing to the lake for a Moroccan lunch (very tasty). Start to finish this trip was solid. In terms of technical expertise, I'm a novice downhill cyclist and while some parts were a bit technical, none of it was too much to handle. I definitely felt we good value in this tour."

It's safe to say our expectations were quickly met, then exceeded. Saif and Farouq handled the trip logistics like champs. Mohamed, Mohamed and Hamoud led our tours seamlessly, keeping us safe, laughing and pedaling hard the entire time. One of the cool things about AXS is that they have a ride for everyone. The Magical Marrakech tour was a wonderful way to see the city (great idea for your first day) and it's suitable for all age levels and fitness levels. Adults and kids alike will get a kick out of the herb/spice shop where the bins of saffron, sage, curry, etc. are flanked by interesting goods like dried cuttlefish (they make toothpaste out of it!), and sandalwood chunks. We loved learning about everything and the proprietor even let us test out a few things without pressuring us to buy. Once you're ready to step it up a bit, go for something like the Ourigane Valley tour, which is a bit challenging, but oh-so rewarding!I highly recommend AXS to anyone with plans to visit Marrakech, and I look forward to seeing all the guys again in the near future - we can't wait to come back!"

Firstly the owners and staff were very warm and welcoming and offered water and tea etc. Very nice people and my wife particularly liked \"Mohammed Z\" who was lovely young man. However this review is about the excursion as a whole and our experience was very different for the two trips.The city tour was not that good and did not involve much time on the bikes. We did this tour on our first day in Marrakech and were taken to a shop by the tour guide and felt like lambs to the slaughter - needless to say we were ripped off in the shop however that is as much my fault for letting it happen. Lesson learned. We also did a walking tour during our trip which was much longer and never once were we taken into \"preferred\" shops. I would suggest this is dropped from the City Tour itinerary as it wholly detracted from our experience.The Palmery Tour was taken by Mohammed and it was only my wife and I on the tour. Mohammed was very patient with my wife as she did not enjoy the off-road cycling very much. We dropped my wife at the hotel and Mohammed took me out for a further short tour through little villages and it was very enjoyable.I can recommend the bike shop and the company as they were excellent. I can also recommend the Palmery Tour as it is great to get away from the city and see the village life. However I cannot recommend the City Tour as the \"shopping\" experience in particulat left a very sour taste."

In short, I can tell you that the guides were beyond excellent and made our trip very, very special. We are all accomplished bikers and the Muhammads (name of the guides) were knowledgeable, friendly, open and great bikers. Everyone from Argan had a can-do attitude, and at the end, there were lots of hugs and thanks all around."

The founders of AXS teams spent 20+ years in USA, so the customer service and professional handling was top notch. Will I ride with them again? YES 10000%Solo event: 10 days (1 day) rest - 650km road across smooth (70%) french style road and 30% rough asphalt (suggest 25mm+ tyres)This time I used an AXS bike, (full carbon/105/SPD/23mm \u2013 excellent condition) with my own saddle;time was spent to get fit right at the shop.Moroccan drivers/mopeds are very courteous to cyclist, alot more than UK drivers. General safety was very good.I elected to ride with x-pro Hamoud Foukahi, who is a goat ! - Loves climbing and fast - very fast! Hamoud was a fantastic rider who protects you from the wind and great signals with hints on improving your techniques. Hamoud cycles at your pace, but don't try and beat him as you won't ;)We had a support car driven by Farouq, who stayed behind us during the whole ride. Farouq is native Moroccan/American and one of the founders at AXS. Farouq attention to detail is 2nd to none, cold water,coke, ice towels!! , snacks; Farouq organised all hotels/logistics all of which were suitable for the event, some of the Riad's are hidden gems.Both Farouq and Hamoud watch your back both on/off the bike, they deliver a service which others could only strive to achieve This text does not do justice to the warmth I received from both Farouq and Hamoud - Thank you.Some of the scenes in Morocco were breath taking, I would recommend this to any Audax or training camps riders.Route details on strava\u2026."

We did 6 days guided biking, one in M'kech and 5 more in the High Atlas, various areas. They tailor made for our ability and wants, which was mainly to experience beautiful scenery and absorb some of the culture in a way that only a bike can give. Talking of bikes, they give you top quality well-maintained equipment and present it to you cleaned and serviced every day. The attitude of the guides seamlessly blends into that of the management: give your best, do it with a wonderful attitude, be concerned for welfare, safety and total enjoyment and let your countryside be the host. I could not be more complimentary to you all, you are FANTASTIC. You might sell a product, but you gift an awful lot more."

            "review": "Read This if you're a Serious Mountain Biker heading to Morocco. If you\u2019re looking for a scenic tour of the mountains on a bike, which is what many people want, then this review may not be that useful to you. If you\u2019re a serious mountain biker looking at off road day (or multi day) tours then read on.I did 4 days with AXS. The first 2 were so so. In fact I got pretty bored. Days 3 & 4 were awesome and made up for it all :) This is what you need to know:***General Stuff*** - The company is great. 5* service. You\u2019ll get what you want if you can explain what you want (that might not be as easy as you think) but it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find any reason to fault the service from the guides, staff or owner. Book with confidence. - Bikes are ace. Top notch kit. Guides are from a road background. They are super fit. - A bunch of the routes are on non-tarmac roads (dirt or gravel). This can get boring if you like more technical riding. - If you want something technical use the term \u2018single track\u2019. I wanted downhill (i.e. Morzine / Les Gets style) but that word doesn\u2019t really resonate in Morocco. - The use of the Intermediate/Advanced badge on the AXS website doesn\u2019t really make clear the difference between the routes. I\u2019ve summarised what I found out at the bottom of this review. Only one of the official routes, OURIGANE is what I\u2019d call real mountain biking. I noticed other reviews allude to this (politely). - There are routes other than those on the site. I describe two below. They\u2019re fairly tough in different ways. They are also Awesome :)- The webiste tours are pretty short. You generally only get one run. One day we fitted in two. Try and push for this with the guide if you\u2019re keen. You can do two easy - none are that arduous (and I\u2019m not particularly fit). - You can use the days to ferry you from hotel to hotel within reason. So I didn\u2019t have to get an extra transfer when staying overnight in the mountains. That was nice. ***On the Routes***THE OURIGANE VALLEY TOUR:If you\u2019re cross country (or enduro) you\u2019ll love this. I struggled a bit with the early climb\u2026 but it\u2019s ok. You go up through a village. The climb is worth it as you descend on rocky singletrack and finally on Navada-esque bowls. This is the only real singletrack on the website rides (as far as I know). It\u2019s a pretty good all round ride, if quite short. This tour really is intermediate/advanced. It\u2019s pretty fiddly in places as the singletrack is rocky and rutted. I definitely would not take my wife. THE IMLIL TOUR:I did this with a newer guide. Other guides may have variations that are better. 95% of this route is either tarmac, gravel or a bit of dirt road. It\u2019s technically very easy. I would take my wife on this route without a second thought. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s badged advanced. The route is visually stunning and the Imlil valley is more temperate. I found it entertaining to start with but without any technical sections it gets quite monotonous. It\u2019s not really proper mountain biking. It\u2019s more a bike tour. THE OUKAIMEDEN TOUR:Similar to Imlil, this is all on a gravel road. The difference is the gravel is often quite big, loose rocks. The whole thing is a road though. Fun, but very samey. Similar to Imlil in many ways. If I had to pick one, I\u2019d do Imlil just because it\u2019s more beautiful. THE PURE DOWNHILL TOUR:This one isn\u2019t on the website. The drop off is around where there P2028 intersects the P2030 (the Oukaimeden Road). This is a pure downhill route that drops you out in Ourika.You could do it on a single chainring bike. It is totally epic and the best thing we rode in Morocco. It stacks up evenly with anything I\u2019ve ridden in the alps. The whole route is wide and rutted. Lower down it turns into natural berms. It\u2019s not for the faint hearted as the going is quite tough but it\u2019s relatively safe if you can handle the churn of the terrain.Towards the end you exit the mountains and are presented with the most breathtaking view of the Moroccan plain down to MK. It\u2019s visually absolutely stunning. It\u2019s relatively short (in time). You could do it in 30mins easily if you kept your pace up. You cover a lot of ground though.I def wouldn\u2019t take my wife and I\u2019d only take serious mountain biking friends. I was sad to not get to do this tour a second time. EPIC SINGLETRACK ENDURO TOUR:This one isn\u2019t on the website either. You start at the crossroads NW of Sidi Faress (it\u2019s where the OUKAIMEDEN tour leaves the tarmac behind).The route goes through three valleys. It\u2019s all rocky singletrack. Some of it is pretty steep. This is technically the hardest thing we did I think (although the guide seemed to think the downhill tour was pretty sketchy - but he was wearing SPDs). You need to be prepared to ride on goat tracks maybe 20cm wide along steeply cambered drop where if you fell, it would be painful! You also need to be confident riding over collections of large rocks and small drop-offs.I def wouldn\u2019t take my wife and I\u2019d only take serious mountain biking friends (and ones that are fit!).There are two climbs on this trail. The first is pretty easy. The second is harder and you have to walk it (it\u2019s too technical to ride for large sections).This tour is 25km completely off road. 1.5km vertical descent and 0.5km vertical ascent and took us 3 hours (we got a bit lost a couple of times so it would be around 2 if you were quick). I found it quite tough going (40 degrees and I\u2019m not the fittest). Enduro people would love it. If it\u2019s summer take more than 2L of water. ***On picking somewhere to stay***We stayed in OURIGANE (at Domain Malika which is perfect). But be warned that, even though Ourigane is in the mountains it still takes an hour to get to Oukaimeden). If I came again I might try somewhere else on the plain rather than in the mountains, particularly if it was at a colder time of year (LE PALAIS PAYSAN maybe). It is nice staying in the mountains though, particularly when it\u2019s hot!***FINAL THOUGHTS***Finally just a massive thanks to the guys. At the end of day two I had low hopes but they totally came through for me in the end. A massive thank you!I really hope the company invests in finding more routes like the ones we tried above. There is so much potential here. It\u2019s totally unlike the alps in terms of terrain and a fantastic place to bike. I look forward to coming back."

From 1,200m we descended 30km from Moulay Brahim to the reservoir of Lalla Takerkoust which we could see in the distance, shining like a rare silver farthing. The brand spanking new bikes had suspension and gears which for the novice took some getting used to. Being fit and used to the adventures of mountain terrain this route was perfect for an off road challenge. The paths were safe with no scary precipices. All professionally planned and executed. We counted ourselves lucky to have fine weather with just the right balance of cloud and breeze. We began with clear blue skies and vivid views of the snowy Atlas peaks before bright wispy cloud obscured them. As we splashed through thick mud and a few sludgy puddles I can\u2019t imagine the route during or indeed after rainfall. Yet despite our guide letting air from the tyres, to give greater traction, it was the flatter slate track that created a skiddier ride. As a group of four we were led with patience and skill that suited our varying abilities and desires for speed and thrills. Goats and local village kids alike watched us pass. With a few photo stops, we headed to our well earned meal beside the jumping fish in lake Lalla Takerkoust, an oasis of peace, beer and sustenance. Our jovial banter of satisfaction accompanied a really huge and tasty salad starter, with the most delicious bread and with a creamy herb yoghurt sauce (tzatziki) followed by our chosen tagine. Our return to the city passed in a dozy daze. A well organised and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Merci Mohammed and AXS-bikes!"

As an avid mountain biker I was really hoping to find great biking in the Moroccan Atlas Mountains and AXS did not disappoint! The quality of the bikes was excellent - brand new 27.5 full sus Giant Trances! You don't get rentals of such quality in Northern California much less Northern Africa! Saif (President) and his team are building a world class cycle touring outfit and are investing in equipment (bikes, transport vehicles, tools) and personnel that you are not likely to find in most parts of Africa outside of South Africa.And our guide - Mahmoud - was phenomenal - tailoring the ride to our skill and fitness level as well as our insatiable desire for singletrack! Poor guy was probably sick of hearing \"More Awesome Singletrack\" at the end of our 4 days together! By the way, Mahmoud is an ex-pro roadie who was with Team BMC in Europe and the Moroccan national team. No way I was out climbing him!We spent 4 days in March in and around the lush Ouirgane Valley riding between several Berber villages. We rode cool technical single track, flowy and fast double track and on occasion, deserted picturesque roads. The backdrops of the snow covered Atlas, the green valleys and apple orchards were jaw dropping and we were compelled to stop often for pictures. Most of the single track trails are higher up so you do need to be fit to reach them. If you don't quite have the fitness, skills or inclination, never fear, there are a lot of beautiful and quiet dirt roads and double track lower down that are also very rewarding. In fact its a lot easier to find smooth double track and jeep roads than it is single track.The non-biking parts of the tour - yes we got tired and occasionally had to stop - were delicious and culturally enriching. Mahmoud always found a great Tagine or grill for us. Once he even cooked a lamb and vegetable Tagine with the owner of a remote fossil and semi-precious stone store who befriended us! In general, the Berber people were very warm and welcoming and having a Berber tour guide helped a lot. The accommodation that AXS arranged was a comfortable, well appointed, Kasbah style resort surrounded by olive orchards and lovely views of the Atlas foothills. A great place to come home to after a full day of biking in the Mountains. When the AXS driver came to pick us up on the 4th day our only regret was that we did not have time to ride so many of the trails that we saw leading off to remote and beautiful mountain tops and valleys. I am definitely going back someday. If you like cycling and exploring new regions and cultures, the Atlas in Morocco has so much to offer and the team at Argan Extreme Sports will help you do it right!"

The route covered virtually every worthwhile sight in the city centre including the Kings palace, Moroccan herb & spice presentation & visit to the main souq amongst others. At first some of our group were a little nervous of navigating the local traffic on the main roads but their minds were put at rest by AXS who use a safety car to follow or lead the group along with instructors who block traffic with their our bikes. This was a highly pleasurable,leisurely tour and a superb alternative to reaching the far corners of Marrakech on foot. They even kept a few over competitive dads under humorous control. Well done & a huge thank you to all AXS staff. \"Awesome\"......"

            "review": "Asni MTB Tour - Phenomenal.. We recently returned from a family trip to Morocco, of which one of the highlights was in no doubt the Asni MTB tour organized by the fantastic folks at AXS. I had been liaising with Samira regarding the tour options for several months prior, and ultimately settled on the Asni tour, for my girlfriend and my brother; whilst my parents and my brothers fiancee went for the Enter the Atlas road bike tour. In short, the ride was great, the bikes were fantastic, the mechanics even switched the brakes to be the British way, the organisers were so good, the guides and driver were exemplary - if you want to get some exercise, see part of Morocco whilst doing so, these are the folks to do it with. I'd go back in a heartbeat and do it all over again, however my time with them was a little more special, of which i'll detail in my longer form review below! We were met close to our hotel by CJ, and the guides, who loaded us up into the van and set off to the drop off points. Hamoud was the guide for the MTB ride, we sorted the bikes out, loaded up with water and figs, and set off on the initial climb. My significant other and I are frequent mountain bike riders based in Utah, and my brother is a very infrequent rider based in London so to say we were different ends of the spectrum was an understatement, however Hamoud made sure to ensure that we were all having a good time. The initial climb was just under 1000ft, under a baking sun so it was nice when the ride ended up going downhill, the trail meandered through villages, through agriculture, into valleys and onto plains - I really can't summarize everything in words, you'd have to check it out for yourself. Samira, Hamoud and CJ were all aware of another surprise that i had been planning which was to propose to my girlfriend; Hamoud suggested several different spots and we ended up heading up to a rocky outcrop that overlooked the reservoir, and the mountains where i got down on one knee. Thankfully she said yes. We continued on the ride, to the restaurant next to Lake Takerkoust where we met up with my parents, my brothers fiancee and settled into a delicious meal washed down with a couple of hard earned beers! Huge thanks go out to Saif, Samira, CJ, Hamoud and my parents guide (i didn't get his name - sorry!) - you guys rock, thanks so much!"

It was a joy being in their company from the moment I entered the establishment to ending the tour with a cup of mint tea down the road with Farouq. They were welcoming from the get-go and it remained so up until parting ways at the end of the tour. Farouq and Samira shared their wealth of knowledge of the city, injecting humour and levity where and when possible. Suffice it to say, the service they offer is tremendous and worth doing when in Marrakech. On the other hand, you'll be treated tremendously in and of itself on account of who they are, their character and personality. You're in good company with this tour operator - both for the service they provide and by the staff that carry out the service. HIGHLY recommended!"

When we arrived for our magical marrakech tour the bikes were all ready for us. Mohammed was a very encouraging guide and he made us feel safe in the marrakech traffic! We went on the palmerie tour straight after the city tour. I found this a bit challenging in the August heat. Mohammed was very accommodating and cut the tour short so that we would be able to manage it! We ended the tour at a delightful restaurant where we were very well catered for. Two days later we were picked up by Mohammed and Said to do the 'Easing down the atlas' tour. This was a beautiful experience. Nearly all downhill and much cooler than the city and palmerie. Many wonderful views and we felt well looked after with Mohammed in front and Said in the van behind. The tour ended with a meal at a restaurant with fantastic views."

The bikes (Giant) were in fantastic condition and of course they had helmets for us and plenty of water. The kids loved the little backpacks ( we could take home) with cereal bars inside for the trip. So thoughtful!As our kids (10 & 8 ) are not used to biking through villages and mountain roads we were a little apprehensive. We need't have been! Our guides were constantly monitoring and guiding them along while cycling with us. We felt safe at all times during the tour.It was SUCH a refreshing, fun and relaxing day out! What a great workout too and incredible adventure to share as a family. To end the day we had a delicious couscous at a restaurant overlooking the Atlas!Saif, CJ and team could not have been more friendly, fun, patient and professional at all times. We felt so relaxed with them. We are very grateful to have seen another side of Marrakech, away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina and the souks.Decidedly, one of our favourite adventures in Marrakech so far.Now that we live, and are finally settled here, we can't wait to get back on the bikes for another adventure.Definitely on our list of must-dos with visiting friends and family!"

I was very fortunate to experience the off road Imlil Tour through the Atlas Mountains. This tour challenged me with a mix of inclines with some great and fun downhill sprints. The tour went through several small villages where several children would run alongside you for a short distance. I was able to stop often to take photos in very scenic areas as we went through the remote villages. The tour guide was amazing and very conscientious of our needs and safety - we stopped when needed for water and lights snacks which were provided from Argan. The views were absolutely breathtaking!Argan Xtreme Sports is a fantastic company, they are very professional, courteous and concerned about their customers and the overall experience. I would recommend this wonderful adventure to anyone that enjoys a biking tour, regardless of experience level - give them a call or visit their website prior to going to Marrakech so they can advise you on the best trip possible for your skill level. I would very much recommend the mountain bike tour for any level of experience with Argan Xtreme Sports."

I'm an intermediate road cyclist, and this mountain biking tour was challenging, yet AWESOME!! A great mix of inclines with some fun descents. We rode through Berber villages and got to interact with smiling children. We stopped when needed to refuel with water and lights snacks were provided. End of the tour ended with a fun downhill recovery ride on the road. The views were absolutely breathtaking all while experiencing this action packed bike ride! We also did the city tour with Mohamed. We got to see a mix of local neighborhoods and the historic Kasbah. Mohamed was extremely knowledgeable and made the ride itself a blast ensuring we were comfortable and hydrated throughout the tour! We explored the souks of Jemaa el Fna, had fresh squeezed juice, saw the Koutoubia Mosque, and rode through the city walls and gates.

The feedback from all of our riders was great - the tour was challenging (at our request) - as we were doing it for charity we all wanted to push ourselves - and we certainly did that! The landscape was actually amazing and the places we managed to get to on our bikes were so remote it was a real privilege to see the Berber villages high in the mountains and the lovely people going about there daily lives (always with a smile and a wave as we cycled past).

It was a nice change from the usual days in Marrakech.The scenery was breathtaking, the tour guides were friendly and helpful, all our needs were attended to (cold water, energy snack etc) and the meal at the end was just what the doctor ordered.Be warned, we took the tour in July and it was HOT. Although this was intermediate level it was tough going - I'd suggest a good level of fitness would be best. Saying that, pace etc is very much dictated by you and you certainly won't be rushed by the tour guides who want to make sure you have a good day."

The person I spoke with on the phone Samira was an owner, this business is family owned and I learned during the tour that not only do they employ several local biking specialists and others, they as well do charitable events for the community, so not only did we have the bike tour of our lives, we were happy to know we were doing a tour with a company that gives back. We decided on a city tour and was very pleased to see the quality of bikes and equipment the company has to offer, top of the line I assure you, and not only were the bikes top of line, so were the guides, years of experience with the local tour guides along with owners hands on approach to the whole experience, we had an amazing tour, more fun than I can put into words.

Cycling through the streets of Marrakech was interesting as we were constantly dogding motorbikes, cars and pedestrians but I would definitely recommend it as a way to view the city in a different light."

Once in the mountains it was stunning, lots of shops for food and water or lunch if you require, roads get worse in the mountains but no worse than the UK!

The company then made alternative arrangements so that we could do this tour on an alternative day to suit us.

The total 5 hours of riding we did flew by and ended with us going to one of his personal favourite restaurants which was truly authentic Morrocan! Testament to the quality of the bikes is that neither of us ended the day with any aching limbs!All of the team were very friendly and you can honestly say it's a family run affair which is reflected in their flexibility and open friendliness. If we come back we will definiately try to tackle the mountain again however, as happens in the UK, rain stopped play.For two guys from Cambridge (one of the bike capitals of the U.K.) who hadn't ridded in yonks we are both thinking of getting back into the saddle so to speak.Wishing you all the best for the rest of this year's season!"

Everything was back to front, right hand side of the road and right hand rear brake, but thankfully no issues there. We were in Morocco with BPM Cycle Coaching and rented road bikes for the week from Argan Xtreme Sports. At the start I had a slight issue with my rear gear but it got swapped over pronto and it was certainly appreciated as we tackled Oukamieden (2675m). I got 1000m into the descent and could go no further, sheer panic gripped me and I needed to be driven down to the foot of the mountain, however, once I was back on the open road, I floored it from Ourika back to the hotel.I would like to say a massive Thank You to all the guys at AXS. Generally being a roady and being very accident prone I was reluctant to say the least when it came to our \"rest day\" of mountain biking!! I needn't have worried. It was a great mix of mud, scrub and gravel, Hamoud led an excellent ride; but more than that, we had a back stop to help the less confident. So with Saif behind me I had a great time and was disappointed when the ride came to an end.Throughout the week weather matched the mood.....fantastic!!! I felt a little bad for Farouq not being out on a bike as he was driving the support vehicle for the day, but he kept us well hydrated. He got a chance to ride with us on Saturday when he took us on a city tour of Marrakech, good fun and very informative, getting to see little bits of Marrakech that most tourists would just wander by.Having a good fleet of bikes is something you expect but don't always get, but we got great bikes AND genuinely friendly, helpful service that made the week a truly fantastic experience! Farouq, I promise next year you'll get a chance to ride with us out on the mountains!! Yes, we loved it so much we're all coming back.See you next year!!!"

AXS guys arrive on time at my hotel for the drive to Ouirgane. Mohammed, Rabie & Hamed(?) must have had a shock picking up a 60yr old client for an MTB ride but they hid their disappointment well. Bikes loaded we headed out of town for the hills and the Ouirgane Valley. Parked up, setup the bikes (AXS supplied a full-sus Giant Trance X4 for the day) and almost immediately started climbing but fortunately only about 450m (vertical) before arriving at a Berber village. Here we changed gear and used our legs for a couple of kms walking, pushing and carrying our bikes through the village. Then some wonderful single-track, donkey track and rock hopping that led us around the hill back to Asni for lunch. Finally a fast descent along the road back to Ouirgane and the end of a great ride. The lads dropped me at the Ksar Shama hotel / villas just along the road.I took the Giant Talon for a one week tour of the High & Anti Atlas. Good service and support from AXS and will be back soon for another tour in the Atlas."

CJ and Hamoud met us at the Sofitel and our adventure began with a short drive through Marrakech where we were quickly fitted on excellent Giant bikes. We brought our own pedals and sent fit measurements in advance. The climb was intense, 7,052 ascent. Hamoud who used to race professionally was a great lead and really encouraged me the last 2-3 km. CJ who drove the sag was always nearby with dates, oranges and plenty of water. My friend had a flat when we began the descent and the tube was quickly patched. We were very lucky with the weather as it was just perfect, in the 50's and 60's. However, as soon as we reached the top at Oukamieden (2,624 meters), the fog rolled in so we decided to be cautious and take the sag down the mountain. The traffic was much more than we had anticipated since it was a vacation day (spring break) and families were driving up to enjoy the snow. The drivers (cars, motorcycles, burros) could not have been more courteous and we never felt in danger. It would have been nice not to have had the traffic but this was really due to the vacation.In arranging the tour, Samira (Moroccan -American) and her brother Saif were great to work with. Their responses to our questions were quickly answered. We had been looking forward to this trip ever since I learned of Argan when I was last here in July and our expectations were exceeded tenfold. In addition to the Zok Tour, which is challenging, the company offers numerous off-road excursions for all levels of ability or interest. I am already thinking that would be fun and another reason to visit the City of Joy, Marrakech."

It was nice to realize that Argan is a family run business.After a good experience with the city tour I decided to join the Atlas Mountain tour, the particular tour which I joined had breath taking views and was downhill for the most part which was perfect for my skill level (mid level), there were two guides in our group so the faster riders could charge ahead with one of the guides, while the other one stayed in the back of the group. The mountain bike was very stable going over rocks and had all the right gears to make it up and down the hills.The guides had a very positive attitude and addressed any questions that came up.

The email communication with Samira was first class and despite me changing dates and requirements a few times, nothing was too much trouble and they did everything to make it work for us.CJ was there to pick us up bang on time and the bikes were high end full suspensions. Perfect for the downhill off road section. The scenery was amazing and pace dictated by us, not Hamoudh who was brilliant throughout the day. After the off road section CJ was there with the van in case we'd had enough, but as we wanted to continue cycling he met us at the restaurant. The road cycle was better than expected giving us a feel for the Berber villages and again some amazing views. The restaurant was surprisingly good too - not a token plate of rice and lamb, we were presented with a large menu to choose anything from and never felt rushed. All in all it was the highlight of Morocco for us and I'd recommend anyone interested in cycling to contact Samira to sort a tour out. 100% worth it and big thanks to CJ and Hamoudh who were fantastic!"

Samira was excellent via email, sorting the 2 days out, we did the Palmery tour, as a first half day, very easy tour between golf course and local living...a bit repettitive as we zig zagged and pretty much re crossed our path many times to fill the time... but good all the same. 2nd tour was a high atlas tour, intermediate to advanced that was pretty easy... mid 20's KM that could have done with another 15km or so to make it into a perfect day. customer service on site was good and very nice people, nearly over doing their customer service to some degree.. bikes were OK, some small probs to some bikes, but with a bit of TLC to their hire fleet, no probs...can recommend. good tours... cheers guys."

We'd thoroughly recommend them.We had originally planned to take an organised cycle tour through Morocco with a UK company - but when that didn't work out we decided to fly to Marrakech and take some bike trips. We contacted AXS by email before our trip and they asked us lots of questions about our cycling ability, bike size, helmet size etc. On arrival our Riad phoned them and they arranged for us to take an off road cycling tour up in the Atlas Mountains with another couple the next day. (Heart of the Atlas tour)We don't normally ride off road - but the superb mountain bikes they gave us meant we didn't feel the bumps and rocks. The views were great too. This valley was green and full of olive trees. We visited an Argan oil cooperative and ate a superb meal in a riverside mountain Berber restaurant. The guides were great and looked after us well all day giving us cultural info as well as technical support.Our second tour (Enter the Atlas Tour) was the next day and involved us doing some road biking (new Giant cypress bikes) up in the Atlas mountains - but in a very different valley. This was much more of a \"moonscape\". There were four others on this trip and whilst they went off for a challenging off road adventure we enjoyed the views on an undulating route on road. The final part of our tour was a long winding down hill ride with magnificent views down to a large lake/dam. We had a late lunch in a lovely restaurant beside the lake.Our third trip we did on our own and was really two half day trips rolled into one: Magical Marrakech and the Palmerie. We'd already seen a lot of the city - but it was still good to hear more about it from our great guide Mohammed. We were initially a little concerned about cycling on huge busy streets as just crossing them on foot had been a challenge! However we tucked in behind Mohammed and were fine weaving in and out of the traffic and even avoiding a donkey cart coming the wrong way down a busy street!As we hadn't seen anything of the new city he took us through the main wide boulevards to the Majorelle gardens and then took us to a small street cafe where we had the best tagine of the whole trip. After lunch we cycled to the Palmerie, swopped bikes at their \"kiosk\" there and then did a circuit around the desert area known as the Palmerie - seeing some Berber encampments and children. I also had two punctures. Sorry Mohammed! Be warned you will come home covered in dust - but most of it brushes off. Having been delayed by punctures we ended up cycling back into the city after sunset with a lot of traffic. Again it would have been almost impossible on our own - but tucking in behind Mohammed we felt safe.The whole team at AXS are great and are keen to ensure you have as awesome an experience as possible tailored to your particular cycling skills and experience and confidence. Their bikes are excellent and well maintained, the support vehicles are very comfortable and they don't skimp on the great lunches they provide.If you are wondering whether or not to take a trip with these guys - Don't hesitate. I'm sure you won't regret it. We certainly recommend them to you and wish them every success for the future. They deserve it."

Samira and Hamoud sorted straight away and returned with 3 fantastic brand new Giant broad bikes. The ride was tough for us 2 but we it was worth it. My 17 year old son enjoyed the challenge though & Hamoud was careful to judge our fitness and stamina levels. Lots of water and energy bars got us to a Berber village where we are the most amazing lunch. The scenery is amazing and you can experience it so much better from a bike! I would recommend and I'm guessing the mountain bike rides would be just as good."

She gave us valuable advise, good information and quickly reponded with questions we had. Being picked up at our riad, by Hamoud and Saif, and driving into the Atlas is allready good to do if you just stay for a few days in Marrakech. High in the Atlas we got to experience the professional mountainbikes, top material in immaculate condition. Hamoud took us through the terrain for the next 3 hours. It was a challenging tour but that was exactly what we, all into our 50s and not perse in great physical shape, were looking for. The lunch afterwards at the lake was about the best food we had in Marokko (stayed for 3 days). If you are looking for a different view of Marokko then just Marrakech and you like a bit of a physical challenge and bike in the beautifull Atlas mountains I can stongly recommend ArganSports."

A great group of guys, well organised with excellent bikes (29\", hardtails for La palmarie and Giant carbon, Shimano 105's for Zok). La Palmarie itself, as an area, I could take or miss but, if you want to see it, this is the way to do it. Anyone who can ride a bike can do it but if you are a bit more adventurous you could have some fun. The Zok climb is a stunning ride and a real challenge (including fantastic scenery) anyone into road riding should not miss. Compares with any climb in Europe. You need a fair level of road riding fitness (say longer UK sportive level) and to be determined to get up. The incline is generally around 6% and rarely above 8% for any length of time. According to my strava file we rode 42 k, of which say 38 was climbing, and gained 2470 metres - so longer and more height gained than their website says at the time of writing but I guess it depends on where you start."

We booked three tours - the Magical Marrakech and two full mountain days - and all were well organised and great fun. First off, we had wonderful service from the companies VP - Samira - who was always available to answer every question we had before we arrived. We started off with the Magical Marrakech and took the bikes we were to use on the mountain days - great fun to be riding Giant Reigns around the City and thanks to the logistics manager, CJ, for making sure we all had bikes that would suit us for the mountain days. Mohammed and Farouk took us on the City tour and were really great fun, telling us lots of stories and showing us the sights of the city. Marrakech is great for cycling - the drivers were really courteous, much more so that in London. It's a great way to see the city and get your bearings - we went back to lots of the places on foot later on in our trip.The next morning we went out on the first of two mountain days. I think this was 'Into the Atlas' but the guys would tailor tours to ability anyhow, there's lots of choice when it comes to routes. The scenery on both trips was awesome - great villages, big mountain views and good food. The lake stop tagine at the end of the first day was the best meal we had in Morocco. Mahmoud was guiding us on this trip and he is simply excellent - super fit, great rider and has lots of stories about the people, culture and cycling in Morocco. Another guide came along with us but I can't remember his name - great guy though and a great rider too. The riding that first day was mixed - lots of sweeping roads downhill, little it of technical off road and some excellent trails and tracks. If you're reasonably fit and have ridden bikes off road just a little you'll really enjoy it. There's full support from CJ on this one too so you can always rely on the van for assistance. Great day out to break up a long stay in a hotel in town.One day later we took our second trip and this time both CJ and Mahmoud came along. This was an epic day! We climbed from 1,218m to around 2,200m in three hits (past Richard Branson's house!) and the views were absolutely stunning. Beautiful villages and a nice local tea stop to refresh. The top of the pass was awesome - really high country - and a great sense of achievement to reach it. This trip would be for more hardened riders really with a good level of fitness. Although it was difficult to get up the climb, the reward was a continuous nearly 3 hour decent on a dirt track all the way to the bottom! Wonderful scenery again and a day we'll all remember. Tips for a big day like this would be wear a hydration pack to make drinking easier on the climb and take some gels/ energy snacks if you're a rider who needs them.In short, I really recommend Argan. They're a great company, really fun and knowledgeable team who love biking and triathlon and are really enthusiastic about what they do. They pick up on time with a good vehicle, have great bikes - the Reigns we had were fantastic, and can't do more to help. We went to Morocco primarily to ride but I think the City ride and the mountain days would be great if you were on a package trip and just wanted to do something different for the day. I don't think you could ever regret it."

CJ & Hamoud picked me up on time and within 2 hours we were setting up our full suspension Giant bikes high up in the Atlas. These guys are great because they ask all about your comfort levels and expectations before picking a route. The ride was just what I needed. Fast, non technical but by no means relaxed, it was some great downhill through Berber villages high fiving the kids as we passed. The ride offered a mixture of terrain with some amazing photo opportunities. If like me you want to escape the Souks for the day and get a glimpse of real Berber life then email Argan and let them show you the Real Morocco, you will not be disappointed"

I haven't ridden a bike in years and have certainly never ridden one on busy streets. I got a little nervous on our first night when the streets seemed to teem with people as well, and I thought it was going to be a disaster.However, I could not have been more wrong! This was a fantastic excursion and a brilliant way to see the city. The guys running the tour could not have been better - they were super friendly and very funny, but also very clearly professionals who knew what they were doing and inspired confidence. The route they planned was very well thought out, meaning that everyone in our group from those who hadn't cycled in a while to those who are bike commuters felt comfortable with the roads and the pace at which we travelled. The stop off in the main square for fresh orange juice was a nice touch.The bikes themselves were well maintained and a good size - I'm only 5ft tall but was able to touch the ground with my toes on a small bike, which is always a bit of a concern! It was a brilliant way to get our bearings of the city and see places - like the palace - that we may not have otherwise got to. The guys running the tours are incredibly professional and it is clearly a slick operation in which I wish them lots of luck. The best compliment I can give is that it's made me want to get back on my bike at home to get fit enough for a mountain tour!!"

The route allowed us to familiarise ourselves with the city and visit parts we would never have seen on foot, plus they gave us delicious orange juice from the main square. Talking to Farouq, Argan are definitely trying to do something different with cycling in Marrakech.

So glad we did this tour while in Marrakech, Generally, a bicycle is a great way to see any place, and in this case (the Hisham Tour) we got to see authentic Morocco up close. The area in the High Atlas mountains is beautiful, starting at about 1100m above sea level. The first section is up, to 1495m. It's not too hard though as long as you can hack the altitude and have reasonable fitness.But the views from there are magnificent, across to North Africa's highest mountain which still had a bit of snow on the longest day of the year.From there, there was an awesome downhill which was made enjoyable by the great Giant Trance X bikes provided by Argan Xtreme Sports, well maintained by Hisham himself.From there, the trail took us through picturesque Berber villages, full of goats, sheep, donkeys and of course smiling children. My wife even got an encouraging pat on the bum from one little guy!We rode this late June and I was worried that it would be too hot. It was hot of course, but pleasant in the mountains and we were provided with plenty of water and fruit, with two rests on our 35km journey. The rests also offer bail-out options if you are finding the going too tough.There were some slightly technical rocky sections which we all enjoyed, but nothing too challenging. Top tip from us is to ride in a long-sleeve cotton top. We rode in Columbia hiking tops which kept us relatively cool. The kids were in cycling tops and got a bit frazzled despite sunscreen. Bring some cycling gloves too.Hisham (guide) and CJ (driver) were great. they were friendly and encouraging, and were super patient with us. Hisham would happily blam down the hills with us then wait for our slower rider to catch up.Lunch at the end is overlooking a beautiful dam, and was a quality 3 course meal in great surroundings.This far far and away the highlight of our stay in Marrakech. I would recommend this or any of the other tours to anybody visiting Marrakech. Don't be put off by the 'Xtreme' tag, there are tours available for everybody. We just happened to choose a long one, and CJ says they have some even cooler tours coming. We were more than satisfied with the Hisham Tour though.We thought it was great value too.

And he was so sweet while staying at a pace I was comfortable with, which I really appreciated. I would definitely recommend this combo tour for everyone interested in learning about Marrakech. Or for anyone just looking to enjoy a fabulous day! It was amazing and it made me feel so alive!"

The plan was 2 week cycling trip around Marocco just me and my bicycle, but when I arrived Marrkech I realize the bike was hit during the flight and one disk brake was bent...It was not the best option for climbing The Atlas!!I found AXN on the web, and half our later I was there. Hisham from AXS did an excellent and quick job, and next day I started my trip without problem!! (750 km aroun Marocco crossing Atlas,Saghro and arriving Argelina border).If you need some help with your cycling stuff or you are planning a trip or excursion around this incredible country I\u00b4m sure AXS is the place (no doubt!)"

Their bikes (Giants) are high-end, well-maintained bikes. The organization of the tour was top drawer. And the organization of the Etape (an annual event that I highly recommend, which Argan Xtreme co-founded to benefit of a charity called \"Education for All\") was the best I've seen. Top it off with an amazing level of enthusiasm for the sport of cycling and making it accessible and fun for all. They catered to the recreational cyclists as well as to the experienced cyclists. I highly recommend these guys for whatever your cycling interests are (road, mountain, local tour)."

We were picked up by CJ and Hisham our guides near the Djemaa el Fna square in the center of Marrakech at 9.00 am to beat the heat. We travelled by bus to a 1400m high plateau in the nearby Atlas mountains and climbed our allmost new mountain bikes.The tour we made was magnificent, views, trails, mostly offroad sheep trails thru small authentic Berber villages. Beautiful nature and colours! Some really technical tracks made it also for good bikers a nice challenge. We ended at the lake, having a well earned and tastefull lunch.Thanks for this well organized and very beautifull experience guys!"

They are a well-organized duo who made us feel comfortable on an on-road ride through the Atlas Mountains. Hisham was an excellent tour guide, who took the utmost care in making sure that we were riding at the right pace for the level of bike riders that we are (read: none). CJ made sure to follow close behind and offer assistance if needed (note: it was never needed as the ride was great for beginners). We stopped periodically to take pictures, enjoy the scenery and have a snack. The ride through the mountains was amazing and offered the opportunity to see the Berber villages and the people and children who still live there.The 2-hour plus ride ended with one of the best meals that we had all week at a Berber Restaurant overlooking a beautiful lake. I would definitely recommend this company for anyone looking to get outside and explore the mountains of Morocco. They have a variety of tours so that you can pick one that plays best to your ability, both on and off road."

We were looking for some sightseeing and something a little more active outside of the hotel. This trip was perfect! As stated, it was great for \"confident beginners.\" Neither of us ride regularly (actually hardly ever), but we are in OK shape. Hisham Ghourdmani was our tour guide and he was fabulous. Took us along at a pace that kept us moving but wasn't uncomfortable for any one. He really kept his eye on the group. We left for the ride at 9:00. It takes about an hour to get to the launch point. It's a very scenic drive, and CJ and Hisham can tell you all kinds of stories and fun facts on the way there and the way back. We were on the bikes by 10:15. We finished the ride at about 12:30. About 1/2 the ride is downhill, 1/4 is flat, and 1/4 is gradual hills. A couple of the hills may be a bit challenging if you don't ride often -- just give yourself some space between you and the next rider so you can get some momentum going and you can keep peddling up the other side. If you get stuck behind someone, and are not used to shifting, you may have to stop and walk your bike up the hill -- but it's not that far. -- and CJ followed the group all the way in the van, so if any one has problems, he can help, give you a ride or whatever. After the ride, we stopped at this great little Moroccan restaurant on the lake for lunch. We had salad, roasted chicked and vegetables tangine -- some of the best we'd had during the week. We were back at our hotel by 3:00 (you could stay longer and have a more leisurely lunch but we had to get back). Hisham and CJ were great and we'd definitely use them again."

We are all beginners on real mountain trails although we are all good road bikers. The level of the ride was perfect -- some pushing of our limits but nothing that felt truly frightening. The bikes were top rate and very well maintained. Our guide was fantastic and set a good pace for us. The route took us through the mountains and some Berber villages, which gave us a much better sense of the landscape than any drive could. We would definitely book another trip with Argan on another holiday - Maybe a longer one next time!"

If you're looking for a unique way to experience parts of Morocco that very few are lucky enough to experience, a trip with Argan Xtreme Sports is the way to go! The folks at Argan are first rate professionals and the entire day was extremely well organized - from the moment CJ and Hisham picked us up, we knew we were in for a great day. Argan is a small, family owned and operated business with impeccable customer service. They were extremely responsive in helping us book the perfect trip for our skill level (we're both advanced riders and avid triathletes) and provided beautiful Giant bikes that were perfectly maintained. Even though we had a great, challenging ride, they also provide on- or off-road rides for all skills levels. Based on our experience and those of almost every other reviewer here on TripAdvisor, I'm confident Argan would provide a memorable trip for anyone looking for a truly unique way to experience Marrakech or the surrounding Atlas mountains.The only downside of our time with Argan was that we did their ride on our last day in Marrakech \u2013 we wished we had more time to do another trip with them. Thank you for an awesome trip Argan!"

We stopped to take photos in very scenic areas and went through villages I would not have seen on foot.The 70km round trip road bike ride from the centre of Marrakech to the base of the mountains and back was the most enjoyable ride for me. I would recommend this to slightly more experienced riders with a good base fitness. It is a long ride with very beautiful and scenic views. Overall the Argan extreme sports have a great company ethos and atmosphere. They are all the most friendly people and very approachable. I would recommend anyone that is interested in a biking tour, of any level to give them a call or visit their store when out in Marrakech so they can advise you on the best trip possible."

I would very much recommend Marrakech as a base for winter training and the guys at Argan Xtreme Sports for the supply of a first class well maintained bike for the duration of my stay. The weather in February was perfect, dry with clear skies and not cold. the roads were in general good and in 5 days I managed about 700 km with a lot of climbing in the atlas about 8500m plus in all. The great thing was that the cycling was interesting, my trip was solo was great scenery was a real bonus. I would recommend bringing an extra tube, I only need one but I think luck was on my side and bring a pump, map etc with you. If you have a problem the guys at AXS are always on hand and will even deliver you bike to your hotel. The traffic was bike friendly as it seems most of morocco rides a bike or moped but maybe not on the correct side of the road, just go with the flow."

Icham would always stop periodically to make sure everyone was ok, and also answered calls from my very nervous stepfather who chose to stay behind. Haha..

Fantastic. The guys who run the shop were really friendly and helpful. On a side note, the guided cycle tours they offer look great, and given the choice between them or one of the numerous sharks in a 4x4 taking you on forced visitations of 'authentic' tat shops, over-priced restaurants and camps would choose these cyclists every time.

I arrived in the magical city of Marrakech in Dec. 2011 and didn't leave until Jan 2012, had to ring in the New Year, and I had the pleasure of doing so with a big part of the Argan Xtreme Sports (AXS) team and owners. I spent over 2 weeks taking in the culture and beautiful untouched, unspoiled terrain, this is done at its best on one of the many tours AXS offers, they have the most sophisticated, fast and even comfortable bikes in the world, in case your somewhat physically challenged, they also offer a tour that is easier on the body. I had the awesome pleasure of experiencing this new business coming to life and would recommend to everyone, young, old, biking enthusiasts, bike pros, physically fit or physically challenged, AXS offers something for everyone. If you visit Marrakech and really want to see it, then make sure you do some sight seeing from a bike...and I would highly recommend doing thru AXS!!!!"

My friends and I were looking for a break from the tourist traps downtown and wanted to take a break to the mountains, where I heard it was a little more off the beaten path. If you're looking for an authentic Moroccan adventure, AXS is the place to go. Our guides were natives (who also spoke English and French) and they had great senses of humor as well. The tour we picked was a little more of a work out, but I know they have easier stuff too. Overall, great experience I would recommend to any level of biker!!"

Luckily for us, the hotel concierge had the contact information for Argan Xtreme Sports, so we made arrangements. The next morning, Saif and crew, showed up at 9 am, right on time with brand Giant new mtbikes. We headed to the lower Atlas, not knowing what to expect, the sights were spectacular. We rode for about 3-4 hours, hard riding as we asked for, passing many wondeful villages along the way. I highly recommend Saif and Argan Extreme Sports for anyone wanting to explore Marrakesh and its surroundings. They are all professionals, dedicated, kind, funny and with passion for what they do."

In 3 days, we covered more than 1200 KM of beautiful Moroccan countryside with treasures and adventures all along the way. From the High Atlas to the sands of Erg Chebbi in the Sahara Desert, it was a visual and informational feast of the senses - and I have not even mentioned the mint tea, tasty tagines, and traditional Berber meals yet! This is a perfect way to see Morocco (especially if you are a bit short on time like we were) and fit in a ton of different things. You have your own private vehicle and guide (ours was Ibrahim) thereby making it a first class adventure. The hotel we stayed at on our first night in Dad\u00e8s Gorges, Chez Pierre, is one of my favorite hotels of all time (and I have traveled a lot). The people of Morocco are beautiful, kind and welcoming. Having a local guide like Ibrahim makes the whole experience that much better, as he knows everyone and will happily tell you what is what, and who is who. He knows how to make you feel like you are the star of your vacation. Don\u2019t miss out on a night or two in the Sahara \u2013 it\u2019s something you will never forget. The best advice I can give you is to sit back, let go of all expectations and enjoy the adventure, oh and pack light. You will not be disappointed. Don\u2019t hesitate to talk to your guides about the Berber/Nomadic way of life\u2026it is something to behold\u2026and as we learned, in the West we might have watches, but the Berbers, they have all the time."

He would also take the initiative to stop for photos and help us with group photos. There was extremely heavy rain during our time there, causing floods and closing roads. In spite of this, Ibrahim was able to find alternative means to get us to our destination. The tour was also very well-planned despite our short stay. It was comprehensive enough to cover the city of Marrakech, a night in Sahara desert, having a taste of local cuisine, and seeing the various berber villages. Food and accommodation was always top notch and the stay in the desert was one of the best experiences i've had. This company is highly recommended as the price of the whole package was very reasonable and they are able to tailor the tour to whatever duration you have. Ibrahim is a great driver and guide and can speak several languages as well."

Me and my partner arrived in Marrakech for a few days prior to the tour and after a bit of craziness in the souks, were pleasantly provided the best guide and driver in Morocco to take us on a tour of his incredible country. The experienced team of locals provide an itinerary beforehand but the tour is really up to you. Ibrahim made sure we saw all the sights but also provided helpful suggestions about places we might find interesting as well as locations for the best photos! The hotels and organised activities are second to none - don't miss out on the desert sahara tour or the todra gorge. Both are absolutely breathtaking. The highlight for us was meeting Ibrahim's family who live in the desert near Merzouga. We happened to be there for the end of Ramadan and got to meet the whole family and share a traditional Berber pizza with one of his twin brothers. From the moment we got in the car, Ibrahim made us feel like family, no question went unanswered and we ended up dancing in the car to Berber music more than once. Would highly, highly reccommend - it's been the highlight of our trip by a long way. Shukran Ibrahim and Camino Berber!Tip: Make sure you bring some smaller notes with you to tip the amazing locals along the way."

Moha organized our program and he also arranged all hotels. Everything worked perfectly. We felt completely safe during all the trip.

We do believe that we had the best experience ever. Camino Bereber/Moha did a great job. And Mohamed was beyond amazing. We do strongly recommend both Camino Bereber and Mohamed to everyone that really wants to know all of the colors of this beautiful country.

After our first day, he was very good at picking up on the fact that we weren't just looking for all the well visited tourist destinations, we wanted to experience a true taste of Morocco. He took us to the places that he would eat. He taught us to speak Bereber greetings and how to haggle for everything. We met his brother, his friends and had a unique experience we will never forget. He took into account the needs of our daughters and was always \"looking out for us\" when we stopped to shop, feed or pee. If you are looking for something special and off the beaten, homogenised tourist track, then book a trip and ask for Hameed.

We traveled all over the country, round trip Casablanca, where we spent our first & last nights. Moha was very easy to work with, making it clear that the published itineraries on his website were very flexible and he would arrange anything we wanted; there was never a problem with making changes. Mohammed was also very flexible and when there was something exciting along the way that wasn't planned, we went there--like a Rose Festival in the Rose Valley, the closing Fantasia of an agricultural exposition, and going off-road to a salt mine, among others. We stayed in riads in the medinas and most were very authentic and, in some cases, really outstanding. Mohammed & Omar were very good companions. Mohammed's English was very good and he was very patient with us. We learned so much about Morocco and the Berber people and there wasn't anything we couldn't talk about with him. We had a lot of laughs as we traded sayings in various languages. I did not give the review a 5 because Moha wanted the first payment sent via Western Union and cash for the balance when we were there. We did manage a payment by WU but it was a pain to have to go to an ATM every day to amass the $ we owed. (Morocco's dirham can only be purchased in Morocco). However, if you want to have an in-depth experience, I can recommend Moha & crew."

I couldn't have expected to tour almost all these places in just a short amount of time. Idir was very well versed with English and knows a lot of things on different places. He is a very knowledgeable guide and is always happy to assist you. Highly recommended tour and offers one of the most attractive rates too.

He replied very professionally to my emails, and also the western union deposit transfer was done without any problems. I travelled with my wife and 7yo son, and Moha really made Morocco an unforgettable experience! It's quite a big difference to the larger tour companies: Moha is a real berber, born in the desert, and he knows the country like no other. He knows the nice and authentic places to go, and knows many of the locals. Also, he was very flexible at moments we wanted to change the program a bit, he really did everything to make our stay perfect. My son still talks about Moha and Ibrahim, the driver: more than a tour guide, they really became friends. The tours are done in Moha's Land Cruiser, a perfect vehicle to explore Morocco, also beyond the paved roads. In Merzouga, his home town, he really made sure we had the best camel trek, because there is quite some quality difference between the offered tours. I am typically very critical to tour operators, but Moha stood out in any possible way. Moha, I wish you all the luck and keep up the good work!"

As my first time in Morocco I was surprised with the diffent colors and places of the country, and particularly impressed by the deep and beautiful Berber culture. But the berber Morocco is something hard to discover by yourself. Moha Camino Berber provided us with \u00a0genuine berber driver/guide, called Ibrahin, that speaks very good spanish and english (and a bit of every other language) and \u00a0works very hard to make everything perfect. There's no worrying about nothing: he knows everything about the desert. Good prices and an ultimate life changing experience, as breathtaking as seeing hundreds meters high dunes.\u00a0"

The fact that you have your own chauffeur driving very comfortable car for the all trip and that you can stop wherever you want, you can try variety of typical Moroccan food anytime you want and you can hear lot of interesting informationes about the daily life in Morocco from your native guide. I highly recommend the trip with Moha Camino Bereber day tours and I guarantee You that You will enjoy. I am sure that the night in the desert will take Your breath away."

            "review": "A great trip to see the highlights of morocco from Marrakech to Fes. We booked a tour to the Ouzoud Waterfalls with Moroccan Safaris. Adil picked us up from Jemma el-Fnaa square near our riad, and he was immediately very friendly. Our drive was smooth and fun, as Adil would play different traditional Moroccan and African music and explain their significance to us. He arranged for a local guide at Ouzoud to take us on a hike around the falls, and it was fantastic. We were able to get to places around the falls that larger tour groups couldn\u2019t. We got along so well with Adil and enjoyed our day trip to Ouzoud that we asked Adil if we could do a four-day desert trip from Marrakech to Fes. Adil immediately agreed and put together a great trip for us. On our first day of the road trip \u2013 which admittedly was a very long driving day \u2013 we stopped at so many interesting places: Ait Ben Haddou, Ouarzazate, and the Valley of Roses among them. In addition, any time we passed a particularly scenic overlook, Adil was happy to pull over and let us get out to take a picture. He booked us in an absolutely beautiful hotel with a gorgeous view in the Todra Gorge. The next two days of our trip were spent in Merzouga in the desert. They were truly amazing. We visited a Berber village, listened to an African music troupe, and took a private camel trek into the sand dunes where we spent the night at a beautiful campsite, eating great food and enjoying the stunning landscape and night sky. Adil was really flexible with our schedule along the way. At one point in the middle of our tour, we were deciding between switching our trip to three days and going to Chefchaouen or staying with our original plan and spending an extra day in the desert before making it to Fes. Adil was very kind to help us brainstorm our best options either way, and was happy to rearrange our trip if we wanted to. It really felt like a personalized trip. We decided to stay in the desert as planned, and enjoyed meeting a nomad family and getting extra time to hike through some sand dunes. On our final day, Adil arranged for us to take a mini-bus to Fes with some other travelers. What\u2019s really amazing is that, after our eight-hour trip with another driver, Adil called us to make sure we had arrived in Fes. Then he called our riad to see if someone would be able to meet us and walk with us through the confusing streets of the medina so we wouldn\u2019t get lost. (We had already begun walking and luckily found our riad!) Adil checked on us again, remembering our schedule, when we were arriving in Casablanca to make sure we got there safely and to see if we needed any help arranging a ride to the airport. He really went beyond the typical tour guide in this regard. He really cared about our comfort and experience in Morocco even after our tour with him ended, and he kept in contact with us and offered help whenever we needed it. Adil made sure we had the best time and saw as many wonderful sights in Morocco as possible."

Has his own 4 by 4 and provided a lot of the transportation I needed. Very enthusiastic about his country and his job. Showed me some really cool stuff and places. Even took me to his hometown for lunch with his family and friends!I guess one critic I would have is sometimes things get a little lost in translation as English is not Adil's first language.

            "review": "Atlas Mountains and Airport Transfers. I have to Marrakech a couple of times this year. This time I was staying for a longer duration, but various different people were joining me, but going back-and-forth on flights at different points. When I needed an airport transfer and spoke about various excursions in Marrakech, I came into contact with Adil through recommendation. He contacted me via Whatsapp and then called me directly on my phone at a convenient time whilst I was in the UK. He did keenly send me all the prepared information on excursions and places of interest via Whatsapp. I had visited these places but didn't know some of the facts behind them so it made an interesting read.I mainly asked Adil for airport transfers, where one of the most reassuring things I felt even after my call was that he was always so responsive to any questions I messaged him with. You can appreciate 'responsiveness' can be really hit-and-miss with some transfer services. Adil checked all the necessary information about luggage, sent us his personal photo for identification, a photo of his jeep, and met us on arrival holding the name plate up as expected. As we agreed a set price (in dhs) all was clear with no issues. Change up some money at the airport to pay in dirhams. On arrival, when we got into his jeep and he immediately provided us with a WiFi password, he put on some amazing upbeat music en-route to our hotel, and all the group were clapping......we just knew with this type of greeting, we were about to have a great time in Marrakech! On the same night we checked-in to our hotel, we were out late and we wanted to buy some water (the hotel mini-bar was not an option). I has WiFi in the restaurant and whatsapp'd Adil on where I could get large bottles from. He was so helpful that he insisted on bringing the water bottles to us directly! 15 minutes later he pulled up in his jeep and waved at us on the open terrace where we were dining. A member of the group was unwell at dinner and he agreed to take her back to the hotel, along with the water, and as someone had to escort her to the room, he also bought the accompanying friend back to finish her meal as it was all within a 10 minute drive. Whilst of course we paid for the water and drive to/back to the hotel (only local prices) it was the small personal and helpful touches (service literally to our feet!) I think is something that you cannot forget with Adil, and it was great that he was free that night. Even when Adil was in the desert with excursions on several occasions, he was still able to respond to messages at occasional points and send from his network of drivers the airport transfers. He always provided us with the name of the driver and also a description of the car, they were always on time. We used his service 5 times for the airport during the trip.There were also Atlas Mountains excursions x 2 groups at different times. We knew how we wanted to plan each excursion, and while you can take on board suggestions from Adil, you do not have to follow the plan given. Tailor make what you want (take out the craft stop-offs if you wish) and fix your price. On one trip Adil drove us there, and the other time another of his drivers. Again on both occasions there was always fun en-route and plugging in our phones to play our music and the drivers were always clapping and laughing. We allowed 6 hours from hotel pick-up to return hotel drop-off (but we did not do any stop-offs). Upon reaching the Atlas mountains the easy entry point I found (tested 3 times!), was a small wooden slatted entrance bridge a few yards along from a dark blue painted restaurant (I have forgotten the name! but it sounded French) on the opposite side of the road.This restaurant is also the best place to confirm as a meeting point (if you do not have a moroccan sim phone) as when you are dropped off, the pick up time is roughly agreed. I think 2-3 hours for the mountains to reach the main waterfall is usually enough! This restaurant was also one of the few places that has western toilets that were relatively well maintained. We also ate the set menu (100dhs or 150dhs set menus) there in the upholstered seating area (which is by the stream) which you get to by using the small bridge opposite the main restaurant from the road/set-down area. You can just order a la carte.Along that small stretch, there are various places you can eat where there are all fairly standard offerings (set price 100dhs or 150dhs menus), but on another occasion we stopped at one of restaurants within the Atlas mountain levels, which had a decent European toilet and washroom facilities and just ordered tagines from standard menu to share and found it was enough. When returning from the Atlas mountains, I recommend driving directly (rather than doing any stop-offs) back, you will appreciate the resting time in the car, the scenic unhindered drive, with some relaxing music, which leaves you with enough energy for any evening you have planned. Once thing we found was Adil's name was very well-known! Especially to many road check-point staff and in restaurants.  Although I initially felt like Adil co-ordinates a large vehicles and excursions business, I found he was very personable and was always able to help on small matters! We had the idea to visit the Palmeraie, which on the face of it sounds like a theme park style area (but it is not!). I read some Tripadvisor reviews about the ease of going there and caught a taxi there. But it is a vast area, and unless you direct the taxi driver to somewhere very specific, you will be taken to a random location (with no WiFi) where it feels like it in the middle of nowhere, and because the taxi driver will have overcharged for the journey, and expect a kick-back from the one waiting guide, the taxi will be keen to wait for a return journey. After realising we were not exactly sure of where we were and how it really all worked, we could not see much around - but were luckily in a small cafe, I asked the cafe staff to phone Adil. He spoke to them and managed to locate us and I was pleased to see him! He explained how the quad-bike/camel riding trips worked and drove us to the area and explained all about the Palmeraie which seemed like 20 minutes away from where we were dropped off. As much as we appreciated the information, we were too hot and bothered and realised we did not change enough cash, and also wasted so much time by then, we decided not do the quad-biking. The reassurance of Adil picking us up helped changed our mood, and we did not waste the entire day, as we asked to be dropped off in Guilez the modern district with the shopping centre and Starbucks. Upon reflection, I feel the Palmeraie was something that should be booked as a planned excursion, but it is something that I have yet to experience.In Marrakech you will find people are generally receptive, but like all holidays you will determine the worth of your trip based cost, which often equals how enjoyable it was for you personally and how smoothly and hassle-free it runs (in a city where negotiation is key)."

            "review": "Somewhat fun, but impersonal tour. I must admit my expectations were probably a bit too high, seeing all the positive reviews made me sure this was THE company to book a tour with. Adil met up with us at our riad and we had a short discussion where we discussed the different tours he could offer. We finally decided to do the Ourika valley and the Essouira tour. He was helpful and professional and i got a really first good impression. One of the key sellings points of choosing the private tour was that we would be skipping all the \"tourist\"-stuff that tries to sell you something. However, as the tour started, we soon realized we were on a rather set program that everyone does. We were able to skip some of the rather obvious and uninteresting stops, such as the pottery making shop and some metal workshop, which was nice, but we weren't able to escape it completely as i had hoped. At the berber village we were sent into a argan oil \"factory\" and felt obligated to buy something in the end, at the herboriste in the end of the tour, again we were treated to a huge commercial show, and felt we had to purchase something. It was a bit disappointing, but it is not the reason i am giving this an average rating. One of my key goals with the tour was riding a camel, and after the berber village, we stopped at some camels that we could ride. However, it was absolutely heartbreaking. The camels seemed thin and unwell, and for some reason i had to ride on a mother camel with a child. I kindly asked Adil to tell the \"camel guy\" to give me a different camel, but i don't think he understood what i meant. Having the poor child camel being dragged by a short rope was uncomfortable to me and seemed very cruel to the camel. My girlfriends camel was tied hard to the read of my saddle, in a very unnatural position, and her camel seemed scared and stressed. The camel ride which was supposed to be a fun highlight of the tour turned into a heartbreaking display of animal cruelty. We continued on to the Ourika valley waterfall in silence. The waterfall was a very nice experience. We got a local guide, Jamal (sorry if that's spelled wrong), who was really cool to trek with, and the trip went up rather nice mountain terrain. Unfortunately, the tour program did not mention that there would be technical challenges to the mountain trek (climbing, skipping from stones, etc.) so my girlfriend had brought along completely wrong shoes, but it worked out fine. The next day we did the Essouira trip. After about an hour we stopped at the most touristy cafe in the world in a small town. And then continued. Here along the road, Adil wanted to show us how argan oil is produced. The way they're illustrating this is by literally lifting goats up into trees, and having them stand there all day for tourists to see. I was just speechless. Poor poor animals. Looked long and hard at the other argan trees on the route, but none had goats climbing in them. Once we arrived in Essouira we were taken to a super-touristy fish restaurant, it was below average food, but pricy of course. Exactly what we would have gotten on a group tour. The program then specified we would get a guide in the city, but we never saw this guide. Instead we got to wander by ourselves in the city, which was actually a really nice experience. It was the highlight of the day, since it was a very beautiful and calm city. Sat down at a local cafe and enjoyed some tea, and then departed back. All in all, the big highlights of the trip made it worth it. Essouira city and the Ourika valley waterfall was beautiful and interesting, but the camel ride and goats in trees-stuff was terrible. Adil was an ok tour friend, but he didn't explain a lot or talk about our questions. Simple straight answers, and safe touristy choices. We're perfectly ok about touristy stuff, but don't say you're going to do a tour that skips it when you're going to do a tour that doesn't skip it. Also, for some reason he never bothered to learn our names. He kept calling my girlfriend Aisha and me Alibaba. It all felt a little mechanic and unpersonal."

I've been staying in Morocco for 3 weeks and my experience has been ok before this tour because I've mostly been visiting touristy places. Taking a tour with Rachid made me absolutely fall in love with this country and all it has to offer. Not only was Rachid the best guide I've ever had - the mountains, desert and everything we saw was completely breath-taking. The restaurants we were taken to were the best I've had in all of Morocco. He was beyond accommodating - making sure we always had water, always went to the best places, and even made sure I always had a vegetarian meal option. And doing Morocco in the summer means you must have air conditioning!! Rachid's car was so comfortable and definitely an oasis from the heat. He was professional, kind, and by the end of the trip you start to feel like you are traveling with good friends. Even after the trip was over, Rachid was so helpful getting me to my hotel and making sure everything was ok. You can tell he really puts his heart into what he does as he is so passionate about showing us the real Morocco, not the one you will ever see going out on your own. If you come to Morocco and don't take this tour you will be missing out on so much. This tour is probably one of the top 3 travel experiences I've had in my life."

But instantly he was so engaging and interested with what we wanted for the trip. He was great with our 3 children and cared how they were and if they were enjoying themselves. The walk up to OUrika valley was fun day out. Lunch was lovely. I was happier giving money to the vendors there than the square. At least they began with a reasonable price. Inshallah when we return Adil we will definitely come back to you. Wish you all the success. Also the kids loved your kind gifts. Thank you Adil!"

He immediately presented himself as someone that wanted to be our friend and would be at our service throughout the whole day, and did so. He took us in his comfortable car on a great trip stopping at several very interesting spots until our destination in the valley. The reason Adils service gets such great reviews is because he is truly a man of the people, and each and every person he meets along the way respects Adil and accepts him for the true kind man he is. Anyone that travels with Adil will benefit from the mass of knowledge he has for his country as well as his understanding and love for all people, the travellers and the Moroccans alike. Anything that you can wish to discover in Morocco will be known by Adil and he will be very happy to take you."

But when we met, he was so friendly and said so many beautiful things about the country and their people, that we got that feeling \" I want more\".

This time I came with a couple of friends, who were coming to Morocco for the first time so I wanted them to appreciate the beauty of the country. From the moment I got in touch with Adil to the moment I left Marrakech, Adil and Rachid looked after us as if we were family and ensured that our stay was worry free. We decided to do a drive through the Tizi n Tichka Pass/ Atlas Mountains and then visit Ait Ben Haddou. It was sublime and we were in awe of the overpowering mountains. In fact, my friend on the journey said it was one of the most peaceful experiences for him and vastly different to the resort holidays he usually goes to. We had some amazing food on the way and were introduced to some interesting shops, with both Adil and Rachid ensuring that we paid local rates. Adil also provided a very comfortable people carrier, which meant we had enough room for the journey. I will be using Adil and Rachid again - I've heard they do an amazing desert trip, so will be trying that next year. Thanks Adil and Rachid - a wonderful trip with great people like yourselves."

He'll have you drinking tea in a tent in the desert one moment, and listening to music from from traditional Senegalese and Sudanese musicians the next. Looking for the best food? He knows the places, no matter what your budget. Want to avoid the tourists? Adil knows how. Want to see hidden sites the guidebooks don't mention? Adil knows where they are. His transportation is comfy, and off-road capable, with plenty of room for your gear, and he'll get you where you need to go. And the man can drive! With a breathtaking level of precision, he navigates roads and streets and alleyways that a normal driver would find impossibly daunting, but he's always willing to stop whenever you like to take a photo or even just stretch your legs. Adil himself is enthusiastic and wonderfully engaging and friendly. He also has a great sense of humor. You'll actually miss him when you go home. :)"

I originally reserved our trip to the Erg Chebbi dunes through a riad that booked it through another tour company which in turn passed our reservation on to Adil. Both myself and my husband couldn't have been happier to have had him as our guide to the desert.Adil showed up promptly at our riad in the morning and introduced himself, speaking impressively good English (as well as many other languages). His 4x4 was very comfortable and during our drive south he played many different types of Arabic language music for us, which we loved. He patiently answered all of our questions and went to much effort to ensure we had a wonderful time.Both of the hotels he booked us into were wonderful. Our room in Dades Gorge had a breathtaking view of the river and canyon and our hotel in Merzouga was right next to the dunes of Erg Chebbi, so we could wander out easily into the desert.Because Adil knew we were photographers, he made every effort to stop at beautiful places for us to photograph. We visited a large rock formation, a geyser on the side of the road, a restaurant serving Berber pizza, a group of African musicians, and many beautiful small villages with gorgeous architecture. Instead of taking us straight to the shops like some other tour guides did, he would always ask us first, \"Do you want to stop here?\" One night when we discovered some friends of ours were staying in Merzouga, he even stayed up late to take us to their kasbah and pick us up when we were finished meeting up. Once our tour had ended, Adil continued to check in with us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He even picked us up from the bus station free of charge to take us to our riad during the next part of our trip and also drove us to the airport on our last day.Our trip with Adil is something we will remember and cherish forever. We both consider Adil to be not just someone who is pleasant to do business with, but a friend as well. I would wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone looking to do this trip and would definitely use his services again in the future. Thank you kindly Adil, for going above and beyond. Saha!"

The waterfalls were amazing and very refreshing after the heat of Marrakech! Adil provides a guide who will take you up to the waterfalls as it involves quite a bit of climbing. We ate our lunch afterwards in a restaurant where the tables are actually in the river, which was really fun and Adil joined us so we got to know him a bit better.

He spoke perfect English which allowed us to communicate with him easily. He was very friendly, helpful and very eager to attend to anything we might have wanted. Adil was very informative as well, he would give information on a particular location we may have been at the time. We travelled in a large four wheeled drive car that was very comfortable and clean which was certainly pleasant.We were picked up by our guide, Adil, from the airport and promptly taken to our riad where we were able to drop off our luggage before spending the day in Marrakech. Adil was there to guide us the entire day and was very helpful in helping us to see the highlights of the city during the day and the souks during the night.The following day we travelled through the Atlas mountains to Ouarzazate and eventually to Todra Gorge. We had plenty of opportunities to stop and take pictures. The mountains were breath taking and Todra Gorge was particularly stunning. We stayed the night at a hotel in Todra Gorge which was a small valley within the Atlas mountains. The hotel staff were very friendly, cheerful and welcoming.The next morning we set out for the Sahara desert and drove to a small town just on the edge before heading out on camel back to the campsite. We had set out in the evening so as not to feel the heat of the sun at midday. It was well into night by the time we had arrived at the campsite after having camel ridden for two hours. The scenery was something that cannot be forgotten. Riding through the desert on camel back with almost no other signs of life is an experience that was surreal. We had dinner at the campsite and admired the starry skies for the rest of the night until the next morning.We\u2019d woken up early the next day in order to climb a sand dune and witness a sunrise over a desert. We then left the Sahara before the midday heat started to affect us. Once we left the desert Adil driven us back to Marrakech which had taken most of the day.The following day we visited Essaouira, a fishing port on the western coast of Morocco. We spent time on its sandy beaches as well as walking through the city and fishing ports in order to see the main sights there. We later returned and spent the rest of the night at Marrakech before leaving for home the following morning.All in all it was a purely unforgettable experience. The sights that we had seen were beautiful and our guide, Adil was extremely helpful. We had a fantastic time in Morocco and this is a trip that we\u2019d all wholeheartedly recommend for anyone planning to visit the country! And off course we highly recommend Adil and his service. Adil raise the bar so much that you would forget you are in an unknown territory."

We had booked to stay in a riad in the centre of Marrakech so wanted to do a day trip into the Atlas Mountains and came across Moroccan Safaris on Trip Advisor - we ended up booking the Ourika Valley Day Trip. We were picked up by our guide Adil at 09:00 from our riad (noting that the riad is located about a 4 minute walk from the nearest car parking area through a maze of winding streets and alleys so it was so nice of him to come and collect us in person instead of meeting us at his car). Then we got into his 4x4 vehicle and set off on the drive. We stopped along the way to our destination in the Ourika Valley to take photos and Adil was very knowledgable and explained a lot about the history of Morocco. We stopped first at a local potter who showed us how they make their array of plates, bowls and tagines, then at a traditional Berber house for a tea ceremony and breakfast of bread, honey and olive oil, then to see how the women make Argan Oil and then finally at a local artists studio (a friend of Adil's) to see the sculptures that the artist makes. Adil was very clear that he was at our disposal and he encouraged us to ask him to stop at any time to take photos. When we arrived at our destination at the Ourika Valley Adil had arranged for a local guide to meet us and take us trekking up to the waterfalls. Luckily Adil had warned us to wear sensible walking shoes as the trekking was quite rocky and we saw a few people struggling in not-so-sensible shoes. On the way up the mountains we saw barbary monkeys and more craftsman selling rugs and other things. The waterfalls were incredible and it was a lovely cool break from the heat of Marrakech. After our trek we sat down at a restaurant on the river for a lovely lunch of tagine and couscous before Adil drove us back to our riad. We really can't recommend this tour enough - Adil was a wonderful guide and it was worth every penny. We hope to see him again and will be recommending him to friends and family :)"

Gotta be real: I didn't like the idea of taking a three-day private tour of the desert because, to me, I understood it as getting in a car with a stranger and being taken to the middle of the Sahara Desert...  But I did it and it was amazing! Adil picked us up from our Riad and took us on an amazing journey through the Atlas Mountains, gorges, and finally to the Sahara to ride camels to a campsite in the dunes where we were able to meet tons of other people. Actually, we were put in a camp with a group that came together and they were all very unhappy with their driver who was apparently \"mean\"; and they were upset that they didn't they had to pay to use the pool at the hotel nor were able to shower until their return to Marrakech 14 hours later- whereas we had a room to store our things, shower, and we didn't have to pay for the pool. The trip was safe and I never felt too isolated from people or places on the lonely roads that connect Marrakech to the Sahara. Adil organized tours, hotels, and meals to accomodate our trip. I'm under the impression that he works with a vast network of hoteliers and shop keepers- (assumably comprised of family and friends) with whom he is able to coordinate and which were all extremely friendly and accommodating! Adil took us to a rug maker in the mountains where we were able to get a Moroccan rug at a much better price than what we could have found in Marrakech. All in all it was an amazing trip and Adil is really able to work with you to make your trip memorable. If you're looking for a trusty excursion outside of the chaotic marketplace of Marrakech, then you should definitely look into this! Thanks Adil! Sorry about making you go out to the desert during Ramadan."

Our guide Adil picked us up at our hotel at exactly the time that we had arranged. Though Adil stated that English was not his 3rd language (as he speaks French, Arabic, Spanish, Italian), I honestly would have though he had learnt it formally.The drive to the mountains was aprox 1 hour and the 4x4 was comfortable and clean. Adil offered on several occasions to stop so that we could take photos. On one occasion I asked could we stop so that I could take a photo of a beautiful village on the spine of one of the mountains, while Adil was more than obliging he also informed us that we would receive attention from the locals who would want to sell us their products. This was helpful and considerate as sometimes this can be an intense experience.We were taken to a traditional Moroccan house where we met a lovely family who happily welcomed us into their home. Though the family were on Ramadan they still provided breakfast and tea for us. Both the woman who owned the house and Adil made us feel very at home and answered all of the questions that we had.After breakfast we were taken to a waterfall high in the Atlas Mountains. One small point I feel could have been empathised more strongly is that it is quite a trek (if you are not a particularly active person) to the waterfall, and so some may find it tough. Thankfully myself and my girlfriend are both quite fit and so had no issues. Adil left us in the hands of a local boy called Jamal who was as accommodating and friendly as Adil. At no point during this trek did we feel uncomfortable or rushed. Jamal's English was again superb and we found it very easy to communicate. The view from the waterfall is truly breathtaking, all the local tour guides were friendly and had a sense of humour. Jamal allowed myself and my girlfriend to spend as much time as we wanted by the waterfall and this even gave me a chance to go for a quick dip in the lagoon. Once we had descended we ate a lovely meal IN the river. The water is less than ankle high and is very refreshing given the 44+ degree heat.The entire day was absolutely perfect, and very reasonably priced (by European standards). While Adil was our guide (and a very good one at that) I feel by the time the day was out he was more like a friend. He is always helpful and obliging even in short notice. Adil even brought us to the airport on our departure day with less than 3 hours notice. He is truly a credit to the Moroccan people and to the company.I would highly reccommend this trip to anyone and everyone, and if it isnt clear by now Adil is your man."

Second day was equally good we went with Saeed, a true gentleman! I have already recommended them to all my friends and if I go Marrakech again will definitely book with them.

He was punctual, friendly, brought our son a small gift and we spent the day at our leisure and pace. Worried the trek might be physically exhausting for our child, Adil ensured he met our criteria in that we as adults also wanted adventure!and boy did we get it!We requested Adil to pick us up at 9.30am and he arrived 15mins early which was nice seeing we had some experience of 'moroccan timing'! We got to know him on the journey there and what was great was that he didnt do the commercial tourist stops to the shops/markets. Its true what the other reviewers have said about Adil. He is very caring about his community and is also respectful to everyone he meets along the way.His energy is super infectious and I would highly recommend his company for tours. I will definately be using his services again on my next trip to the Sahara!Atlas mountains are breathtaking, the trekk can be designed to suit your requirements esp with small children and its something everyone should experience! Well done Adil on your exceptional service! We hope to meet you again in the near future!"

The Riad we stayed the first night was very cute and traditional, the food was nice and the host was very kind. When we arrived to the desert we had the camel trekking with sunset and time to go around the dunes which we higly enjoyed! Comfortable, private double beds in tends for the night. The food was alright and night's entertainment was great with all the guides (one more couple was there with us) playing traditional instruments to Arabic songs around a small fire and under the clear, full-of-stars sky.Clothing; 35-38C during the day, so light wearing, still warm at night even in the desert.Money; worth it for the money, not much spent for lunch (which was not included in the tour). Stops; we had frequent stops to stretch our feet/ have a coffee, to nice photo points, for lunch and whenever we felt like seeing the great landscapes on our wayThe tour; we went by UNESCO world heritage sites (kasbahs), the long palmtrees' oasis, argan oil factory, the high Atlas and anti-Atlas mountains, etc.We had an unforgettable tour, souk in the sun, landscapes and Moroccan culture.

We had some frequent stops but he stopped at resting areas with either great food or views. After a whole day of driving, we finally arrived at the camel site. We got to choose and name our camels (mine was Momo). Even though we had to trek through a sandstorm, Adil saved us all with his excellent navigation skills. We arrived at the campsite to some amazing tagine chicken for dinner. After the storm passed, the sky cleared up which was the perfect time for us to stargaze. We had a lot of fun with singing and playing their drums.What I loved the most about this trip was our tour guide. Adil was relatable to us as we all were in the same age group (we've all attended college). We've played games, shared a ton of stories traveling and even shared our most embarrassing moments. We also had a lot of questions about Morocco which he was always happy to answer. Secondly, the tagine chicken skewers were my favorite meal in any restaurant we stopped at. It's flavorful and fulfilling.Since this is a two-day trip and you're staying in for 1 night, I would recommend packing some basic hygiene (toothbrush, soap, and shampoo) as they do have a bathroom with toilets and showers. Pack in some light cotton pajamas if you're going there during the summer. Additionally, wear light cotton clothing that covers you so that you don't get sunburn on your arms and legs. If a sandstorm ever hits you, make sure you bring something to cover your head and eyes! Also, I would recommend wearing close-toed shoes since the sand is hot as well."

The \u201cmonkey feet\u201d hills, the palmeries in the gorges, and of course the dunes are particularly memorable. The sunsets, star gazing, and sunrises are unbelievable. The camel rides were fantastic- I recommend bringing a journal or a book for the relaxing siesta between the rides to and from lunch.If you\u2019ve never driven outside a first-world country (or in Boston), this may not be where you want to learn. We were thankful for our driver, Brahim, who not only stayed awake for the whole drive each day (we took advantage of the opportunity to nap when we wanted), but navigated around the hairpin turns, the sometimes unmarked roads, and the other drivers. We always felt safe with him. Rashid was an excellent guide who patiently answered all of our questions (we had a lot) and introduced us to Morocco\u2019s culture. He was always open to talking, but also respectful of silence. We particularly enjoyed listening to his collection of Moroccan music. He knew where to go for the best dates, helped us buy cloth for a turban (highly recommended for the camel ride), and always made sure we were comfortable. His sense of humor added a wonderful dynamic to the trip. All in all, highly recommend this tour along with Brahim and Rashid."

Everyone is there to help personalise your tour and make it memorable from the Top Desert crew to the Hotel in the Dades gorge, the places they stop for food especially the Ksar Timney because that is exactly what they did for us. The transport is luxurious and air conditioning amazing even on a 38 degree day. Mubarack is the safest driver. We felt we were in great hands from our pick up till drop off. During this time we had gone from driver and guide to friend. He was always smiling and happy. During the trip we never felt rushed and he gauged our interests such as fossils and geography so took us to places that were of interest to us. Between the four of us we can not say one thing was our favourite as so many things were. Up there in the list is the camel ride to and from the desert, the Kasbah, the fossil visit and seeing the huge diversity in scenery as you travel through MoroccoOverall we wish to thank Mubarack for making our trip full of memories and we hope to be back one day."

From the moment he picked us up he made us feel so comfortable and we bonded straight away. He was funny, kind and told us many interesting stories. He picked us up in a 4x4 brand new clean and very spacious car with air-conditioning which made every hour of the journey in the car comfortable. On our way to the desert we made many stops at gorges, small towns and beautiful valleys. Abdou knew how much we loved animals and the little stalls on the roadside and always stopped and showed us things he knew we would enjoy. The desert itself was the most incredible thing I have ever experienced. Seeing the sand dunes for the first time really is completely breathtaking! The luxury camp was everything I pictured plus more. The whole set up was beautiful, our rooms were spacious and having a private toilet and shower was great. Everyone involved was so friendly and the food was the best we had in Morocco.Our whole experience with Top Desert was faultless. They are professional, flexible, always prompt in replying to emails and most of all they care about what their customers want and go above and beyond to make the experience memorable.Abdou, thank you so much for being our guide in this tour.

Moha, the Top Desert agent, was able to tailor a trip to our needs even though most of the packages are three days or more and we only had two days. Our tour guides, Brahmin and Rashid, picked us up in a brand new and comfortable Toyota Land Cruiser and drove us twelve hours through the Atlas Mountains and the desert ( no roads in the desert, just riding across the sand). They stopped often at interesting spots, and even planned a nomad's picnic lunch. The scenery is beautiful and our conversation was so delightful that getting to know these two men was as much a highlight as the desert. As a young child, Rashid grew up in the desert, and his family has been nomads for generations, so the desert is his pride and home. Brahim is an extraordinary driver negotiating the mountain driving with ease and somehow never getting tired. We felt totally safe with him at the wheel. When we were an hour from camp, we were met by camel's and rode the last hour through the Sahara on camel. It sounds like a touristy thing to do, but really riding through the endless waves of sand dunes on the back of my calm camel in the total silence was a powerful and profound experience. I glanced over and there was Rashid, walking along like a desert prince back in his home. The tent camp is definitely glamming, with a comfortable bed, toilet and shower. We just happened to be the only people in the camp that night, so we had four or five friendly and polite men attentive to our every need and it was almost embarrassing to be that indulged. We sat in front of our tent as the sun went down, chatting with Brahim and Rashid, and it felt as if we were with friends. We were served a huge portion of lamb tagine and couscous for dinner. We arose early to watch the sunrise over the dunes, and after breakfast, we started the twelve hour ride back with lovely stops, and at the end, I was sad to say goodbye to my new friends. I highly recommend this experience to see an essential part of Morocco."

We selected to take the two day trip through Draa valley, the berber villages and stayed in Erg Lihoudi dunes.The experience was truly something we will remember for a lifetime. The Draa valley and the drive to the Berber villages through the Atlas mountains was mesmerising. The whole nomad camp experience, sunrise and sunset in the dunes was stunning!All the people involved, from driver, tour assistant, the people running the camp and the camel owner was perfect.the only feedback (not negative) we need to give is the rushed driving to the dunes - which made us a bit nauseated but it makes sense as we merely made the sunset by 30 mins.Thanks u all"

It began with a very easy-to-use website and very clear communication before arriving in Morocco. They contacted our Riad before we arrived in Marrakech to ensure someone would be available when they came to pick us up at 4am. They made special accommodations as we wanted to go to the big dunes and just spend one night in the desert because we were short on time.Our driver Brahim and guide Rachid were excellent. We felt safe driving the long distance over the atlas mountains and through the desert with brahim. He was prompt with timing and an excellent driver. On the ride out to the dunes we stopped in a few towns as we requested for tea and coffee and to see the local culture. We stopped at a few lookout points along the way as well. They were very flexible with stops as we drove. Rachid was very knowledgeable about the landscape, architecture, and Berber culture. Upon arrival at the dunes our accommodations were excellent. We were able to sandboard and explore. Rachid and Omer made an amazing dinner with traditional soup and lamb tagine. Truly excellent food. Brahim and Rachid graced us with some Berber drum music around the fire following dinner.The drive home was also exciting with stops in the village with a female carpet cooperative. Beautiful carpets and reasonable prices. Overall Brahim and Rachid really made our Chegaga experience everything we could have wanted and more. They were knowledgable and enjoyable to be around. Would definitely choose Rachid and Brahim to guide our trip again!Just an FYI that this trip is typically done in 3 days/2 nights but we had limited time in morroco. If you're open to the drive though it can be done by an early am departure on day one. These guys made it work and it didn't seem rushed at all. Michael and Varsha"

Both were extremely attentive and answered all our questions. They made sure we were enjoying ourselves at all times. The tour itself is very comprehensive. To me, it was the best way to get from one city to another, as it gives you the opportunity to see different berber villages, visit old kasbahs, cross the Atlas Mountains, and most importantly visit Erg Chebbi! A definite must!"

            "review": "Sahara desert in the summer. After reading countless of forum posts on tripadvisor and contacting a few other companies, we ultimately decided to book with TopDesert because Moha was always attentive and quick to reply to our e-mails and the package they offered was very competitive in relation to the price. It was a decision we definitely do not regret and would encourage everyone to book with TopDesert because of the hospitality offered by the guides! TopDesert is a small family company and both our driver and guide Moubarak & Mukha were very hospitable and did their best to accommodate to our requests. They were always ready to answer any questions we had & Moubarak was keen to share his vast knowledge of Morocco with us. As Morocco gets really hot in summer (reaching 40 degrees in the afternoon) and we were not able to deal with the heat well, Moubarak was able to plan our schedule such that we had lunch in the late afternoon to avoid the blazing heat! On the first day, Moubarak & Mukha arrived at our Riad exactly on time to pick us up and waited patiently for us to finish our breakfast before heading off. Throughout the trip, Moubarak was very accommodating of our requests and did his very best to make our trip as comfortable as possible. CarWe were picked up in a 4x4 vehicle which was very comfortable and had ample space for both of us. You can choose between airconditioning or natural fresh air and if you wanted a/c, don't hesitate to tell the guides! They are very friendly and the aircon worked well and helped us cool down when the weather was blazing. In addition, the car was clean and neat when we first went in, which meant that they had it cleaned up as they just finished a tour a day before. Accommodation The accommodation provided to us on the first night was perfect for the price we paid. The Aircon was working, which is something important in this 40 degrees weather. In addition, the toilet and shower was clean and working well. We had a comfortable night and had a good rest. To top it off, we were greeted with an amazing view of the waterfall from our room. Dinner and breakfast served were large in portions, and with quality.On the second night, we stayed in the desert and due to the heat, we decided to sleep on the pillows and beds laid out in the open in the desert with the guides and locals as it was too hot in the tent. We enjoyed the starry night & the Berber music the desert staff shared with us. Food served by the desert hosts were decent, with ample portions. The toilets and showers were surprisingly clean, and toilet flushes well, although the pressure in the shower could have been a little stronger . However, keep in mind that we are in the desert and so it is probably a lot harder to provide the same amenities. That said, Moubarak constantly checked on us to make sure that we were comfortable & even woke us up in the morning so we could catch the sunrise!Throughout the long car journey, there were a lot of photo stops made so that the journey did not feel so long. We visited the places included in the itinerary & they absolutely blew us away! Moubarak was always there to ask if we wanted a photo and a huge bonus was his great photography skills!! Thanks to him, we now have a lot of photos to look back fondly upon! All in all, if the weather had been better, we would definitely rate this trip 10/10! Thank you Moubarak for your hospitality & I encourage everyone to book your trip with TopDesert! You will not be disappointed! "

We were very lucky to have had Moubarak as our tourguide, we couldn't have wished anyone else. Throughout the entire trip, he told us the most interesting facts that made us able to understand Morrocan culture as well as the nature and history. We also got the opportunity to see the real, true Morroco. Moubarak was always in the best mood and couldn't get that funny smile from his face. He treated us like friends and made us feel welcome everywhere we went. By listening to his visions and stories, it became clear that our tourguide was someone with a beatiful, warm character. The first day of the tour we crossed the Atlas Mountains through a wonderful route and Moubarak stopped the car on the best places so we could take as many pictures as we wanted. At night we stayed in a nice hotel in the Dadesvalley. We received a warm welcome, the staff there was very friendly. The next morning we crossed another part of the Atlas Mountains and in the evening we arrived to the Sahara. After an epic camel ride through the Sahara, we stayed in a camp in the desert. The food there was absolutely delicious! The best and most pure Morrocan food, better than the food in all the recommended restaurants of Marrakesh, truly. After our meal, we had a perfect evening. Three lovely toearegs danced, sang and played music with us under a magical heaven full of stars. After a while Moubarak joined us too, which made it even more fun. The toearegs were so kind, welcoming and funny that I will remember that evening for the rest of my life! We got the chance to sleep outside under the stars. The last day we drove back to the Atlas Mountains through another route and we arrived back in Marrakesh in the evening. During the whole trip, there wasn't a single moment I was bored or not having fun. The landscapes were unbelievebly enchanting and we had the best company so it would be impossible to not have loved the tour. Thank you Top desert, Moubarak, the staff of the Dadeshotel and the toearegs for giving me three of the best days of my life.One essential tip for those who have planned a tour with Moubarak: if you download 'Helo' by Adele and lots of songs by Years&Years, the car will be turned into a real party and your gide will be the most happy man in Morocco!Lots of kisses, DJ Kato"

We had read that this desert and sand dunes is more magical than Zagora so we chose to do this tour. We woke up at 3 am to be picked up at 4 am with our driver Abdul. We couldn`t find any tours that had only 1 night as we were only in Morocco for 4 days and Top Desert was kind to arrange what they usually do in 3 days/2 nights to 2 days/1 night. It was a lot of driving but we are used to travelling long distances. We were able to visit Ait Benhaddou at 08h00 and there were only about 4 ppl there which was great. Our driver informed us that about 1000 people visit this location a day so we got to beat the rush! Abdul was very funny and knowledgeable. We are 2 young Canadians in our late 20`s and early 30`s and felt very safe! We ended up being the only 2 going into the desert with this tour company with camels and were a bit worried at first spending the night alone with a bunch of men but no one bothered us. Also there are many other camps that are very near by! Everyone was really kind and they sang us songs. They asked us to do something Canadian and we randomly did the ``Chicken Dance`` and explained many ppl do this at weddings for fun. While on our drive back I woke up to see our driver and my friend doing the ``chicken dance`` in the car. It became our joke. The supper at the berber camps was delicious!! It was a called Tajin. It was the best stew I have ever had and my father went to Morocco 40 years ago and said it was the best stew he has ever had as well! Would highly recommend it! However would recommend doing the 3 day/2 night tour if don`t want to drive 8-10 hours + a day.P.S. If your an animal lover, please bring some treats (all the animals eat soft cheese - even the cats (very soft cheese almost like philadelphia cream cheese type that I saved from the Riad) and I saved lots of uneaten cooked chicken or fish to feed the cats/dogs. I did learn that next time I visit a country with many strays I would bring some small containers and bring water - I don`t know where the animals drink in some of these hot places). So please do that, these animals would very much appreciate it! Thanks!"

            "review": "Epic Sahara Adventure!. We just got back to Marrakech after a 3 night 4 day tour from Marrakech into the Sahara. We had an awesome guide named Moubarak who took great care of us in all aspects of the trip. The best part of this company was the interaction with local people in the Sahara and on the way there and back. We visited small villages and were given multiple opportunities to interact with locals and really feel the culture and spirit (which is entirely different to Marrakech!) Our guide helped us to learn basic language and inform us on all aspects of life in Morocco. The accommodation and restaurants we visited all had a local feeling and you didn't feel like a tourist and were always treated well by the staff. The Sahara is amazing. We spent a day in the local Oasis after riding there by camel, then returned to camp by camel at sunset. The sunsets and sunrise are great and the night sky is filled with stars. The staff in the camp were great, Hamid cooked great meals and cleaned up all the unwanted sand while we were out and our camel guide Mustapha also cooked an epic Tagine for us in the oasis. Overall we absolutely loved the trip and want to thank all the staff for there consistent hard work and attitude while also managing Ramadan, we really appreciate everything you did for us. The way they care for the local community and their attitude and commitment to making sure everyone is cared for is amazing and we will be taking that away with us. All the best to the top desert team and Moubarak, always take the weather with you!"

            "review": "Wonderful desert - poor driving!. Having picked this tour group from the many\u00a0 positive reviews on trip advisor, we had high expectations going on our 3 day, 2 nights tour to the desert from marrakech. The majority of this tour has met (or we would go so far as to say exceeded) our expectations although we did experience some issues. Our driver (Mubarak) picked us up an hour late, which wasn't a great start. However, shortly after pick up, we were driven to numerous beautiful sights on our way to the desert.The first thing we noticed in the 40 degree + heat in June, was that although our car had the option of air con, it wasn't used until we had to put it on ourselves (around 5 hours into our 7 hour drive as we couldn't take the heat any longer). Other than a very small part of our three day journey, the driver preferred to have the windows down (blowing oven hot air into the car) and so we were rather hot and uncomfortable throughout.\u00a0 My hair was also a windblown mess, sitting in the back seat.We were able to take some great pictures.\u00a0 The driver pointed out different sights to us but no explanations were given as to the history of what we were seeing.\u00a0 There were also a few times that we did feel a little scared with the driving - we were overtaking every car we came across round bends on the mountains, tailgating cars and the driver talked on his mobile whilst doing the driving - but thankfully there were no incidents other than oncoming vehicles flashing their lights at us for being so close to hitting each other. The driver also had his moroccan music on so loud that it gave us both a headache, although to his credit, he did turn it down when asked.\u00a0 We did raise the driving as an issue but we were told that if he hadn't been driving the way he had, then we wouldn't get anywhere. I was also mocked by the driver for being scared (he made reference to me as a woman which I found to be both sexist and very offensive) and was told that I should \"place my trust in god\" and basically deal with it, which was neither appreciated nor a useful response or indeed professional. There were several rest breaks put in for our incredibly long journey. At one point the driver drove off without notifying us,\u00a0 we believed he left to carry out personal shopping/errands. Our suitcase, belongings including our wallets were in the car with him and we had no idea whther he was going to come back to get us. He would also stop at markets to carry out personal shopping.\u00a0 Despite the above, we were thankful for the effort put in by the team especially during Ramadan, which we appreciate is a tough month. Once we arrived at the desert, we couldn't\u00a0 believe how beautiful it was. We stayed in absolute luxury in the Sahara desert. We were\u00a0 not expecting such comfort in the middle of no where, we had fully plumbed washing facilities, personal sun loungers, a private fire side traditional music experience and all of this was under the beautiful starry sky (it's worth waiting up to see the Milky way in all its glory).We were even able to celebrate our 30th birthday with a cake provided complimentary by the team!The team in the desert were amazing! They couldn't do enough to help and make our trip as enjoyable as possible and we absolutely loved it!We have never been more glad to get back to marrakech in one piece.\u00a0 We would rate the desert experience as 5 stars as we could not fault anything once we arrived. However, the driving did let us down a lot and so overall, we would rate this experience as 3 stars. "

My fianc\u00e9 booked our day excursion to Essaouira through Top Dessert, leaving from Marrakech.We had Moubarak as our driver for the two of us in his very spacious and comfortable car. We couldn't have asked for a better person to take us. He is a very kind, caring and generous man, who treated us more like old friends rather than paying customers. He made us feel very comfortable and welcome, and the trip was a pleasure to share with him. He was very happy to answer any questions we had and we also felt he taught us a lot about Moroccan culture and history.Our day started with Moubarak meeting us at our Riad in the Medina of Marrakech at 8am. He welcomed us and explained our itinerary for the day.The overall journey to Essaouira took about 3 - 3.5 hours with various stops along the way. The first stop being for coffee and breakfast in a nice cafe in a small village.From there our second stop was a short stop in the countryside to see the goats that climb the argan trees, which we both enjoyed very much and was a sight we had never seen before. The experience was only made better by getting to hold the most adorable baby goat.After that Moubarak took us to a woman's co-oprative where they make the argan oil. A very friendly lady took us to see the women at work where she talked us through the process and the different uses of the nut. She then took us to the shop where we sampled the different cosmetic and edible oils and butters, where these can be bought if you wish.It was then back in the car where we enjoyed more conversation and good Moroccan music with Moubarak. It was then a short drive to our last stop before Essaouira which was a view point looking over Essaouira and the coast. Here we took photos and you could ride camels if you wanted.Then the final leg of the trip took us to the Medina wall of Essaouira where Moubarak gave us a short walk around the Medina explaining the area then he walked us down to the port where he suggested we had lunch, which we did. He then left us to it to have a look around the town for about 4 hours, which was plenty of time. We had a lovely lunch on the port where we got to chose our fish, which had all been caught that morning. We then casually walked around the Medina and did some shopping. For any music lover you must visit Bob's music, which was a hidden gem.After our time in Essaouira we met Moubarrk back at the car to make our journey back to Marrakech.All in all we would highly recommend this trip and if you have Moubarak as your driver you are in safe hands and will have a lot of fun along the way! Also to add my fianc\u00e9 said Moha was fantastically helpful when it came to organising the trip. We wanted a trip to Essaoaira as my fianc\u00e9's mother had been and Moha helpfully recommended that a day trip would be the perfect amount of time to take it all in which it was. He was very responsive and helpful. Highly recommend without a doubt!! Sean and Noemie"

No question a camel trek across the Erg Chebbi dunes would be memorable - but it's the people you share it with that really makes such an excursion exceptional! Our guides Moubarak and Adil, as well as Ibrahim (driver coach - excellent job!), were wonderful hosts. Their knowledge, friendliness, and enthusiasm made us feel like partners in this adventure, as opposed to only paying customers. No request, big or small, was turned down (ex: \"isn't there a solar farm out that way? Yes, there is - so let's go find it!\") and they did their very best to ensure we were comfortable, well fed, safe and seeing all the key sights. Two notes: these guides were not only excellent drivers over the 1100+ km trip, but they could really sing (Moubarak) and drum (Adil)! We really enjoyed this three day trip - I would highly recommend signing up with Top Desert for this tour. Don't forget to ask for Moubarak and Adil!"

Every place had something unique and we have wonderful memories.The desert was absolutely magnificent and the camp where we stayed was amazing! Thank you to all for the effort put into making the camp look so welcoming and authentic. We have taken many pictures with all the small details, our camel ride and enjoyed all the food cooked to perfection and the traditional Berber music by the fire in the evening under the stars!

Moubarak, our guide, is and will likely remain one of the most kind, generous, thoughtful and optimistic individuals I have had the good fortune of coming into contact with. Five friends accompanied me as we traveled to Marrakech, all of us experiencing our first trip to the African continent in our young lives. Immediately we were blown away by the culture shock that makes up that hectic city, but not soon after inspired by the open and vibrant nature of the people there. We had been in contact with \"Moha\" and embarked on our (3 day) \"Marrakech desert trip to Erg Chegaga dunes\" the morning after our initial arrival (I would recommend doing what we did and dedicating 2 days to see Marrakesh itself; we returned for another night after the tour). Moubarak picked us up at our hostel's doors and immediately began conversing and getting to know all of us. He frequently told us stories, and never ceased to spread his contagious optimism about life as we traversed many many miles throughout the Moroccan countryside. He knows his country. That can be concluded without a doubt. He and other members of Top Desert have not placed \"profit\" or \"business\" as their greatest priorities. No, instead Moubarak's philosophy towards life is one where he can share stories, spread cheer, and as clich\u00e9 as this all sounds: see to it that the world consistently progresses towards being a better place. Throughout your stay he will take you to see snow in the Atlas mountains, the Saharan desert, and countless Berber villages. Knowing the country and being an excellent driver allowed him to allow us to see a large portion of the southern third of the country. Too, he never left us uninformed about cultural or historical significance behind the places we visited. The night in the desert is truly harmonious; no modern buildings to block your sights or smog to prevent the night sky from being draped in bright stars. My only complaint about my trip with Top Desert stems from my own foolishness - only allowing myself a week to traverse this remarkable country, and only allotting enough funds to spend three days with top desert. I hope to return to Morocco one day, hopefully alongside family or close friends, and when I do I will most certainly be looking into contacting Top Desert. There is something for everyone in Morocco - brilliant landscapes, cultural hubs, forests, mountains, and ocean. The Moroccans know their country best, so it never hurts to allow a new friend such as Moubarak guide you in a manner that allows you to see so much of it in such little time."

As we were only in Morocco for a short time we could only do the two day/one night desert trip to Erd Lihoudi.This means many hours driving each way but the scenery is beautiful and our guide / driver, Abba was interesting, helpful and a very competent driver. Added to this, his car was air conditioned and comfortable. The road through the Atlas mountains does twist and turn though so those suffering from travel sickness may wish to take tablets.Camel riding through the desert edge and small dunes was good fun and we arrived at camp in time to climb a massive dune and watch the sun set over the Sahara desert - a memory to keep forever!The camp itself was comfortable, with beautiful tents complete with proper beds, plentiful blankets and electricity. There was even a shower block and toilets which were kept very clean.The food, served in a lovely communal tent, was very tasty, as was the tea! The traditional music after dinner was another happy memory as well.On the journey home Abba was his usual happy, helpful self, stopping at many places for stunning photograph opportunities, the film studios, Kasbah and lunch."

Initially, we had a problem with a change in flight time and before we even arrived to Morocco they were helpful and accommodating. Once we were there, it was nothing short of spectacular. Our sherpa was Abdul who is knowledgeable, funny and stopped at nothing to ensure we had an amazing trip. We did the two day one night trip to Erg Lihoudi Dunes. We were able to ride camels, go sand boarding and camp for the night. The food provided was delicious- they even accommodated for some dietary restrictions. The tents were comfortable and the sherpas even moved around beds so that my friends and I could stay together. Each of the two days we had a 9 hour car ride which was pretty long but the views along the way were beautiful and Abdul stopped whenever we were hungry or needed to use the restroom and also provided an aux cord. In addition, Abdul had his brother pick us up from our hotel and drive us to the airport even after our tour was over. I would recommend this company to absolutely anyone, especially Abdul."

We opted for the 3 day, 2 night excursion from Marrakech to Fes with a night in the desert at Erg Chebbi. From the beginning, everything was seamless. Rabii \u2013 an incredibly nice, wise, and philosophical guy that we had endless fun with! \u2013 met us at the airport and we departed from there. The tour was very comfortable; the first day was packed with beautiful sights and caf\u00e9s or spots to rest. We stayed that night in the most idyllic riad in a fairly secluded valley. Waking up in that valley was otherworldly. We then departed to the desert. We took camels to a beautiful tent camp from which you could see the border with Algeria. (Sandboarding, drumming, dancing, and stargazing all part of the fun.) The last day dropped us in Fes, stopping in various small cities along the way.We planned to stay in Fes one day, and graciously, Rabii offered to stay a day and take us back to Marrakech the next (not usually covered in the tour). We worked it out so that we paid Rabii the same amount we would pay the Moroccan coach. This was perfect for all of us, and it was bittersweet to say goodbye to Rabii at the end.This was the highlight of our week. I wouldn't have done it any other way. Through talking with Rabii and the locals, I feel like I got an accurate and insightful look into what Morocco means to them, which is what I find most meaningful.To clarify, we were four students, and this was a very good use of time and money on a student budget."

As they say in their website, they are truely Berber local Moroccans who definitely know how to project their beautiful country and culture to visitors!. Right from my first contact with Moha, I was extremely well guided and all questions patiently answered. Adil and Ibrahim, the 2 Berber guides/Chauffeur made made my trip extremely special with their kindness and super friendly approach. we also had wonderful discussions all along the way. The Landcruiser provided was very comfortable. The highlight of the tour was certainly the Sahara Desert, which was a dream-come-true for me. I couldn't imagine such a great desert camp right in-between the dunes. The Camp is like a miracle (tastefully done accommodation, flowing hot water etc..). Overall, Top desert must your choice, if you are looking for interaction with locals, understand Berber culture and feel one among them. After all, this trip means much more than just clicking photos at beautiful spots on the way. Well done Top Desert Tours and high respects from me!"

Firstly, Mubarak is a saint, it has been amazing watching someone be so kind to so many different people. He is a wonderful man. And with a wonderful man you get wonderful driving, a wonderful journey, a wonderful adventure and the wonderful list goes on!There is a lot of driving involved but the hours fly by as you drink in the beautiful scenery of Morroco. With plenty of oppurtunities to take pictures and stretch your legs.Once at the dunes you must savour every moment as you don't get long there. We chose to quad bike for an hour, I 100% recommend this!! Then we rode a camel. The dunes are absolutely amazing and the sunset was so peaceful and beautiful. I would totally redo the trip just for to do it all again. Also, the boy who was working at the camp at the dunes was timid but very likeable and made our time at the dunes relaxing and comfortable. I would recommend this trip to anyone. Accommodation and food through out was good. I have a few tips if you are to go:1. Bring sweeties for the nomad and Berber children2. Don't go to the gallery, this was the only negative about our trip. They say you are obliged not to buy anything but don't take no for an answer and are quite brash and forceful in getting a yes3. If you have sensitive skin bring a full set of pjs for the tent. I have sensitive skin and have come up in a rash from the sheets while my bf is fine. I can't hold this against them as my skin is ultra sensitive! "

Top Desert provides smooth, magic carpet trips through the mountains, past Kasbahs and gorges to the dunes of the south. And back, sadly. A magic carpet Land Cruiser picks you up and whisks you away from bustling airport or chaotic Marrakech, stopping where you wish en route. Your driver, in our case Excellent Abdul, provides commentary and explanation where and when you need it. And the number of beautiful things to see is phenomenal. It's worth being aware that there's a lot of driving involved (although you can also spend days, lazy or active, as you wish, in the desert). Certainly in early spring the nights are really cold. I am pretty sure we'll be going back and I am sure that Top Desert would tailor-make for our next itinerary."

I will start by saying that that was our single favorite experience in Morocco.We chose to do a 3 days tour to Erg Chergaga and everything went as smoothly as possible. Moha was really helpful with the booking and he always answered every e-mail or WhatsApp message right away.We got picked up at our Riad in Marrakesh right on time and we made the trip in a very confortable, very big and new Land Rover. On the way to the desert we stopped at a lot of beautiful sites, including the place where they shoot a lot of famous movies like The Gladiator and Game of Thrones!The road to the desert is really really beautiful.. we drove by all those really brown moutains with all these really green and lush oasis on its feet. It was one of the most beautiful landscapes we ever saw!Then we got to the Sahara Desert. SO. AMAZING.I wanted to cry when we got there, I wanted to cry when we watched the sunset overlooking miles and miles of sand dunes. I wanted to cry when the night came and we were greeted with THE MOST AMAZING starry sky of our lives! There were zillions of stars EVERYWHERE we looked. The sky was SO BIG, you had a perfect 360\u00ba view of the horizon. I never felt so connected with nature, SO BLESSED by its beauty.And then I have to talk about our guide and driver, Abdoul. I'll start by saying that you are actually NOT our guide and driver, you are family.We couldn't have asked for a better person to spend these 3 days with. He know so much about Morocco, he is so smart, so funny, so friendly! He played soccer with my dad and my sister, he played and sang berber songs for us, he told us stories and played charades with us. He gave my dad his turban as a sign of friendship and he now has a Brazil shirt to remember us! We named the desert dog together (Astolfo, remember? hahaha). And on the way back, when me and my father were feeling sick, he even took care of us and gave us medicine. You were amazing, Abdoul! Thank you so much for everything! And remember that when you come to Brazil, you have a home here! And also you have to come because we need to play soccer again, the re-match! hahahaWe would also like to thank everyone else that spent the night at the desert with us.. Ali, you were so great helping go up at the dunes and bringing us water when we felt like passing out hahaha and thank you for sharing the sunset with us! We have photos together that I will e-mail to Moha later, so you can see :)Anyway.. if I could give one advise for those planning a trip to Morocco, that would be it: GO TO THE SAHARA. Watch the sunset over the dunes. Stay up at night admiring the most amazing sky. And do that with TOP DESERT and Abdoul. I assure you, you will never forget this experience.(The person from Top Desert who reads this, could you please show it to Abdoul and Ali? It would really mean a lot to us!)"

Also, having a completely private tour was the perfect way to go.We had some ideas about what we wanted to do before we left (from Orlando, Florida) and Top Desert created a custom experience for us, tailoring it to each of our needs, without hesitation and always with perfect recommendations. There's no way you'll know everything that you want to do before you get here, and their flexibility and ability to plan activities and reservations on the spot was mind-blowing. We were picked-up at the airport by our main guide, Abdul, who was outstanding, and considered a good friend to all of us now. He went far out of his way for us on numerous occasions and was just incredible. He was also a safe and great driver, something I can absolutely appreciate now, afterwards.Before going on our desert tour, we also expressed interest in hiking the Atlas mountains (Toubkal). They set us up with incredible and hospitable guides that took care of everything. We also ate lunch and slept in a Berber village--an incredible experience. In addition to answering about a thousand of our questions about Marrakesh and Morocco in general, we drove to Erg Chebbi (in a nice Land Cruiser) and spent the night in the desert, rode camels, 4x4s, sand-boarding, etc. They made it all happen without issue and always asking for our feedback. There were also several places, food, shopping and experiences before, during and after the desert and hiking trips that they helped us out with and just made the entire trip amazing. I've been on a few other tours before, but Abdul and Top Desert really went above and beyond, tailoring our entire trip for us and made it the trip of a lifetime."

            "review": "A fantastic trip, and a truly fantastic guide.. I was on a 6-week trip around Europe this winter with family, and we decided to head to Morocco for ten days to escape the cold. An old work colleague recommended Top Desert, having just traveled with them. I emailed Moha, who handles the bookings, and his communication was excellent. We requested Moubarak, as my friend had spoken really highly of him. Top Desert was really flexible, allowing us to put together a slightly different itinerary. We had the entire trip booked a week in advance - very short notice, but Top Desert delivered. We spent 10 days in Morocco and 7 of them with Moubarak. Our itinerary took us from Marrakech to Erg Chebbi in the Sahara, traveling via the Dades Gorge. After Erg Chebbi we went up to Fes, stayed a night, and then went on to Chefchaouen for one night (to see the famous blue Medina) before returning to Fes and flying out. Essentially we took the 5-day desert tour from Marrakech to Fes, and added a two return trip to Chefchaouen. I highly recommend it. It's worth noting that Moubarak didn't have the necessary paperwork to be our guide for Fes or Chefchaouen, as it wasn't really part of their set tour. We were told of that in advance, and it was not an issue as both of those places we were eager to explore solo. In terms of handling the bookings, Moha did a fantastic job, and there was constant communication between he and Moubarak throughout the trip to make sure things we running smoothly. While on our trip we met another Top Desert guide, Abdou, who was with another group. We found a deck of cards and played a few games of cards with him. He's an absolute legend.But now some things about Moubarak. He's a very safe and experienced driver. At the very beginning of our journey, heading into the Atlas mountains we got stuck behind a convoy carrying all the King's horses (literally). We crept along behind the convoy for a good 40 minutes until Moubarak found a moment where it was safe to overtake. He has the patience of a saint. He is from the south, specifically Merzouga, so he knows the people and region he's showing you. He knows where the best view is. Where the cleanest, tastiest food is. He also knows an incredible amount about Morocco's history and geography - as we found out later in our journey, Moubarak has also studied many of the major philosophers. Come armed with questions, because Moubarak is a knowledgable man. He likes music - bring a good playlist and an aux cord, and make sure \"Stand By Me\" and \"Hotel California\" are on there. Oh, and \"Know Yourself\" by Drake. He'll help you put together your Moroccan playlist.He likes to stop and buy fruit from the farmers along the road. And it's really, really good.He knows a backroad in the cedar forest of Azrou that will bring you up close and personal with some incredible wildlife. He does an incredible amount behind the scenes. I got a sinus infection in the desert and my nose swelled up instantly. By the time we got back from our camel trek Moubarak had made a return trip to the pharmacy in Merzouga and brought back medicine. I didn't ask, he just went. I had some antibiotics and was fine within a day. Choose Top Desert. You'll be glad you did when you're sitting comfortable in your Toyota Landcruiser, watching the giant tour buses navigating the narrow passes. You'll be glad you did when you see that of all the desert camps, you're staying in the best one. But mostly you'll be glad you did because you'll have the time of your life, and you'll make at least one new friend.Thank you Moubarak, thank you Moha!"

Our driver and guide, Abdoul, met us at our Riad in Marrakech at 7am on the dot, and the rest is history. Not only was the Land Cruiser itself quite comfortable (and we were in it for a long time), but Abdoul made sure we were good every km of the way, from letting us listen to our Western music (we switched it up and grooved to some Moroccan tunes too), to stopping for our countless photo opportunities, to making sure we were getting the best deals on all of the souvenirs and goods we wanted to buy.I have not laughed as much as I have on this trip in awhile. Abdoul went above and beyond, and always put our safety and well-being first, but he couldn't prevent the stomach pain and tears from our countless belly laughs ;) and he is a great percussionist to boot!Our camel trek was about 2 hours long, and another guide, Aziz, led our group through the desert, had us stop for an epic sunset (which turned into a photoshoot), and took us to the Berber camp. The camels were very docile and i even had a selfie session with my camel, Bob Marley, but man, make sure you stretch before and after! Those Camel Massages are no joke!The food, the accommodations, and the destinations were all top-notch, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves every minute of the tour. When Abdoul dropped us off at our Riad in Fes, it was one of the hardest goodbyes we've ever had to do!Moha and Abdoul, I commend you for creating this family-oriented tour company, and for giving the best customer service I've ever received. I know the two other girls in our group feel the same, but they want to write their own reviews just so we can all give 5 stars :)Thank you for giving us the tour of a lifetime!kathy"

Very responsive with arrangements through email and wattsapp, and they delivered on what they said they would - a very smooth, professional experience. Khalid is a lovely guy, very knowlegeable and willing to go the extra mile to make sure we had a wonderful time. The desert camp was right on the edge of the desert, and apart from the poor (ie unusable) state of the sandboards and boots, it was a really cool place - great food (our 'tent' even had a shower with hot water!) and in a wonderful location.We would recommend Khalid, Moha and Top Desert without hesitation. Honest, reliable, safe and personable - they made it a great trip!"

Our guide - Abdul - was knowledgeable, helpful, knew the country well and couldn't have been more fun. We learned a lot, laughed a lot, and got to see everything we had hoped for. Our camel trekking was a once in a lifetime experience. We chose to \"glamp\" and all felt it was worth the extra money. The accommodations were wonderful and the people at the camp were kind and most helpful. We watched the sunset over the dunes and got up early the next morning to watch it rise. It was amazing. We would all recommend Top Desert."

Fisrt of all Moha, thank you for being so nice helping us to find the best option regarding our budget and available time; and then our guide Moubarak and driver Ibrahim, for being so kind and tireless, for attending our requests, for providing us a safe trip, for directly contacting our rihads on pick up and drop off, for everything. We strongly recommend them.All the comments in tripadvisor were important for us to make a decision at the time. So, i just want to reinforce their professionalism and reliability.It is tiring the 10 hour roadtrip from Marrakech to Erg Lihoudi, but ir totally worth it. You will not regret a minute of it."

            "review": "Safe, fun and amazing!. A bit of background on me and help for those who may be apprehensive. I'm a city girl who doesn't like dirt, nature, camping or really anything related to outdoors. But I am open-minded and willing to try things because I've only got this one life. I'm glad I visited Morocco and experienced this tour. I felt safe and welcomed. Not showering for a couple days was a choice I made, and I'd do it again for an experience like this. Like pretty much everyone who is heading to a new country for the first time, I had a lot of questions and worries. Moha is the one who answers emails, and he is very prompt and amenable to tailoring the tour to our needs. We did the 4 day/3 night tour. We were picked up at our Riad in Marrakesh (Hotel Arabe). We spent two nights in the desert and one night in a Riad on the way back. He even dropped us at the airport!Our driver was great. He drove fast to get us to the desert in time for the sunset on day 1. The off-roading was bumpy but it was clear he was in his element. He knew what he was doing, and we were in a safe car.The desert campsite is beautiful. We were there 2 nights and decided not to shower so can't comment on those. The toilets are ok. They don't flush, and you pour water down when done. Dinners were always great. Breakfast was adequate. I would recommend bringing your own soap. The soap for washing your hands wasn't that great, and I'm wondering if that is what got us sick by the end of the trip.One of the days we did a camel tour to a nomad's home for lunch. It was 2.5 hours on the camel each way. We ended up with bruised bums and incredibly sore muscles. I'll never ride a camel again, but this one experience was worth the pain. The nomad and his family only spoke Arabic. The teenage daughter spoke some French, so I was able to communicate with her a bit but overall we just simply chilled at their temporary home for a few hours for tea, biscuits and lunch. A goat ultimately ate all my biscuits, but that's ok. It was the most authentic experience we had and awesome!I would not recommend riding a camel for longer than 30-45 minutes at a time... unless you want seriously painful thigh gap. Therefore, ask for the shorter camel ride to watch the sunrise in the morning or to a nearby desert restaurant for lunch. My camel did take a nose dive and popped right back up. I wasn't thrown thanks to holding on for dear life, but that was pretty scary!The sunrises, sunsets and stars at night are the best part of the trip. We stayed in the luxury tents and they were great. Lighting isn't the best, so make sure to use your iphone flashlight or bring one. Keep your phones on airport mode so you can use necessary features like alarms and flashlights without losing too much battery. On the way back, we stayed at Ellouze Riad relatively close to Ourzazate. It was a decent riad with adequate showers, a beautiful garden and view, and a decent pool. The owner is French and the food was great. The next day on the drive to the airport, we stopped for lunch at a restaurant recommended by our guide in Marrakesh before heading to the airport. It was some of the best couscous I've ever eaten. Then he dropped us off at the airport with plenty of time before our flight.We gave our guide a big tip at the end because the whole trip really was above and beyond. I'll post some pics when I get a chance, but I assure you a picture could never capture our amazing experience. So what are you waiting for? BOOK NOW!"

I was a bit apprehensive before the trip since I'm paying such a large downpayment to a company I don't know in a foreign country, but I'm glad that the tour exceeded my expectations. Moha, the owner, was responsive and answered my \"numerous\" \"numerous\" questions and gave me all the information I needed to customize the trip. Moha, our driver and guide, exceeded our expectations. Without him, the trip experience would not have been the same. Not only did he look like a well seasoned tour guide, he had alot of experience, had a great personality and took care of us very well. I had asked the owner for a guide who could speak english well and our guide exceeded my expectations.The camel ride was a bit different than I expected. While still in America planning the trip, the owner told me that the camel ride would be 1.5 - 2 hrs but our camel ride was only about 25 minutes total... I was fine with the short camel ride, but if I had known that the camel ride was only 25 minutes, I wouldn't have bought desert gear when I was still in America.My opted for the luxury tents and it also exceeded our expectations. The onsite staff were awesome. The tents were great and I had no complaints about the tent, bathroom, showers, and mattress. The food at dinner was great but the breakfast wasn't very good. We were told by the staff that we should wake up early to see the sunset and that they would take us at a specific time in the morning, but when morning came, no one took us to see the sunset; we had to go on our own.The only real minus of the trip was that we never got to do sandboarding even when I had specifically mentioned it to our guide. This was partly because we wasted alot of time at 2 \"sales\" visits - ie, visits to 2 establishments that were packaged as cultural visits but they really wanted us to buy stuff. The most annoying sales visit was to a carpet store that took more than an hour. We did get a nice demo of their many many carpets, but even though the host insisted that buying was not necessary, his staff didn't take no for an answer and were doing hard sells and used many other pressure tactics. They wouldn't leave me alone even though I had no intention of buying any rugs. For the record, their rugs were very expensive and I didn't buy any.Despite some of the minuses that I mentioned, which were not egregious, I would absolutely recommend Top Desert. They are reputable and provide high quality tours."

We did not get a tour guide as we thought we would but our driver was pretty good at giving us some history and facts about the areas we went through. We did not feel rushed through anything and was given as much time as we needed at each stop. the ride through the Atlas mountains was amazing and the hotel was fantastic. Everyone staff member was polite and very easy going. The trip to the dessert was amazing! We did not get a offer for sand boarding but we were not interested. The dunes and the view of the Algerian boarder were phenomenal! I have been camping lots but nothing like sleeping under the stars in the Sahara. The food at every place was at least good most were excellent. We were introduced to many locals who of course always had a pitch but we never felt pressure to but a thing. We actually were welcomed into the home of some carpet makers got to see first hand how they did there work. Now of course we were offered to by a rug or 2 after tea and conversation but when we could not buy one there were no hard feelings. The experience in that mans home actually motivated us to find the money to bring a large carpet home. So I guess his pitch worked :). Over all this was a great experience but be ready for a lot of time in the truck! it is a long drive but so much to see."

We opted for Top desert, because they quickly responded to questions and delivered customer service to which you feel comfortable to fully prepay the trips.On a Monday we went to Ouzoud. Our driver, Khalid, is very nice, careful driver and knowledgeable about his country. He actually recommended us to change our 3-day desert tour from erg chagaga to erg chebbi. The reason is that erg chebbi has beautiful red colored dunes, so we were sold. The day tour to Ouzoud was a great experience. We did not opt for a tourguide, and stupid us, we got lost. So you might want to be less 'adventures' and opt for the guide.Khalid was also our driver for the 3-day desert tour starting on Wednesday and you can hear he is passionate about his country. We had ample opportunity to take pictures or take potty breaks. You will visit the high atlas mountains, its kasbahs, the Telouet kasbah and the world heritage protected ait benhaddou kasbah. The hotel on the first night was in Ourzazate and it was beautiful and comfortable. The second night was in a camp, and it was an experience we will never forget. It is wonderful to be in the desert, but we are a little bit high maintenance, so the very simple toilet and shower threw us off a bit. However, that did not stop us from enjoying this experience. The third day you drive back to Marrakech, which is a very long ride, but possible to do. Just sit back and enjoy the view, because it is just gorgeous.Thank you Moha, for your quick and professional services during the reservations and a special thanks to Khalid, who is so kind and customer focused, you cannot not feel comfortable sitting next to him for three days. Thank you Top Desert, for delivering us a once in a lifetime experience."

But we found the TopDesert tours through the excellent evaluations in TripAdvisor and we are really happy with our choice!During the planing of the trip Moha was really helpfull and really nice, answering really fast to every questions that we had.They even were kind enough to call our Riad the day before our trip to plan our pickup with the riad owner.We loved our guide Moubarak and our driver Ibrahim! :) We strongly recommend them! Moubarak was available to answer to all our questions, even the odd ones, and he has a great sense of humor.Arriving to the desert was amazing.. Since the camel ride at the sunset, our conversations under the sky full of stars, the dinner (the best tagine that I ate at Morrocco), the songs and the games after the dinner, the sunrise at the dunes.. We loved it! :) And the sky... That sky! The most starry sky that I've ever seen.. And the silence.. Wonderful! Once again, before our return to Marrakech, Moubarak called the riad owner to plan our pickup at the Djema el Fna. He was really kind.We strongly recommend TopDesert tours and the guide Moubarak!

The car was nice and clean and the driver (Habib) and guide (Muhammad) were excellent. We did the 2 night/3 day Erg Chebbi Sahara tour and were advised that if there was ANYTHING we wanted to do on the way or anything we wanted to know, that we were to ask as it was \"our trip\". We stopped off every hour or two, sometimes just to take pics and sometimes for a little break from driving. The places we stopped off were beautiful and the guide had so much to tell us. Any question we asked he had a wealth of knowledge about and usually a funny story to go with it. The place we stayed on the first night was unbelievable. We spotted a waterfall close by which we went to and had a dip in the water. Great place for photographs too. We then had dinner and relaxed on the terrace with an amazing view. The food was delicious and we were treated like kings by the lovely staff. We all agreed that if the trip was to end before we even got to the desert that we would have been happy with paying the amount we did. So when we actually did arrive at the drop off spot for the desert we were super excited, and it didn't disappoint!When we arrived in the desert after our camel ride and picture taking we had dinner, and then after that we relaxed with our guides and a few locals. They played some music for us and then they went to bed, leaving us to explore a bit. We lay on one of the dunes looking up at the clear star filled sky while having a few beers that we picked up on the way, until the early hours. It was the most peaceful experience I've had and probably the best night of my life! The trip continued for another day and we were happy enough to be finishing it off as there was so much driving. I would recommend anyone considering this tour to go with this company and if possible ask for the same guide that we had (Muhammad) as we were in no way disappointed."

They always stopped whenever I wanted to take a picture, and if I needed anything out of the ordinary, they always helped track it down for me. I was there for 15 days and visited about 85% of the country. The highlights were, of course, the Erg Chebbi dunes where I went camel trekking and dune buggying. They were both great, but the dune buggying was incredible!! I also went hot-air ballooning near Marrakech for the very 1st time (and I've been to 64 countries). I also checked prices and compared them to other companies out there, and their prices were very competitive with the companies I checked, but they really excelled in helping me plan my trip and Moha was able to get back to me via email ASAP to make any necessary changes we had to make. The riads were clean and comfortable and centrally located to the tourist areas. I highly recommend Top Desert...and if you ever had any doubts about travelling to Morocco...I felt very safe (and walked around, many times after midnight), the people were friendly and easy-going.

We booked 4 days and three nights. This reduces the time spent in the car a bit, which was great for our two teenage sons. The first day we went over the (still partially snow covered) Atlas Mountains and saw picturesque Berber Villages and the amazing Kasbah in Telouet. After a night in Quarzazat we went through the sheer endless Oasis of the Draa Valley into the dessert and stayed overnight in tents in the Erg Chegaga Sand Dunes. That afternoon and night in the dunes was one of the most magical travel experiences of my life. In a landscape straight out of the \"English Patient\", Abdul organised a sunset Camel ride and arranged dinner for the family in a secluded spot in the dunes, lit by millions of stars. We slept in spartan, but comfortable Touareg tents.The next day we drove back to Bab Rimal and after a relaxing for one last night in the Oasis drove back to Marrakech.The best part is: Before this trip my boys liked going on holidays, after our time with Abdul, they can't wait until we go travelling to far places."

Our guide Jamal was so helpful, from helping us communicate with locals, learning about the people and the area, and finding us good deals on keep sakes. He was also kind and answered all questions that we had. Moha was also great to email with in setting up the trip. The views were amazing, as was every stop we were taken to. The people, culture and food were intoxicating. I would LOVE to join them on a tour again someday, and so should you!"

It was a very good experience, with a comfortable Toyota, Land Cruiser and and excellent driver-quide (Hamid - I highly recommend him). He gave us a lot of good tips and showed us some great places to eat. He was able to communicate fluently in 2 languages (english and french) and helped us to communicate with the locals.The night in the dessert was very nice. Even if we stayed in a traditional tent there were all needed facilities (toiled, shower, current water) and an excellent food. The only negative aspect was the accommodation on the first night in the Dar Essyaha Hotel, where was very cold and we had tasteless food for dinner. Over all I recommend Top Desert."

The tour involved a lot of driving but the views and terrain visible from the car were very interesting. The desert camp was very cool -nestled in against the dunes and the guys entertained us with music around the campfire that evening. Our guide was very friendly and gave us a free lift to the airport the day after the tour. Stopping at A\u00eft Ben Haddou on the way back was very interesting and the drive through the back roads into the Atlas mountains from there was stunning.If you've only got 2 days free then this is a good option but you will spend a lot of time driving. February was a good time to visit as the weather was a pleasant improvement from Europe bu t the streets weren't overcrowded with tourists."

Most of the review relates to the desert tour, as essentially the Essaouira trip was primarily a transport service.The most importAnt aspect of the trip was the guide, and Salah was fantastic - really cautious driver, very easy-going, friendly, knowedgeable about Morocco, its people, the desert and just about everything else. The cherry on the icing on the cake was when my other half forgot her sunglasses in the car after our last trip, and he came to give them to us the next day at no extra cost.The vehicle was also excellent - clearly a purpose-built all-terrain 4x4 (Toyota Land Cruiser), reliable in the desert terrain but also very comfortable.If I had to make a negative comment I'd say some of the venues chosen for stopovers on the way to the desert could have been better - the food was generally pretty poor - but then I guess there were probably limited options in those towns and villages. Not enough to knock off a star!The locations in the desert (the lunch stop and the camp) were very nice - the desert camp with decent sanitary facilities (although do use bottled water to brush your teeth!) and the lunch stop a very nice little oasis. And the food prepared by the cooks in those places was some of the best we had: succulent chicken skewers for lunch, and an excellent tagine for supper (despite it having been prepared in a sandstorm!)And finally - the main event, camel trekking and sandboarding in the dunes, is amazing - mainly for the views over the rolling sea of sand. My one regret is that in 'M Hamid (the last village before the desert, where you spend the first night) we didn't venture into town. There are a few cafes serving desert tourists, but other than that it's a proper desert town with few of the trappings of Western civilisation - we saw it through the windows of our car. You have time for a walk around on the morning of your second day before driving off into the Sahara but we missed out through sheer ignorance.All in all, a wonderful excursion, very worthwhile!"

Not only to Moha/Abdul and their family operate well-run tours but the family run business only adds to the authenticity since they were born in the Sahara.

Overall a fun and safe experience....would recommend it to anyone."

I am a college student and was studying abroad in Europe for the summer of 2014. 5 of us (2 girls and 3 boys) really wanted to go to Africa and sleep in the Sahara. We did a lot of research and I ended up contacting Top Desert, and I ended up talking to Moha who is probably the best customer service agent I have ever spoken with. He worked with our cramped time schedule, responded quickly, and answered the million questions I asked about the tour. Our group flew into Casablanca, took a train to Marrakech, and despite the fact that we arrived and hour after we had previously told Moha, our tour guide Sala (not sure of the spelling) was waiting for us at the train station with a sign with my name. The vehicle was super nice (a Four Runner if I remember correctly) and he was a great driver. Very safe. He drove us out of Marrakech and into the Sahara. It is a very long ride, but it seems short and relaxing because we took a break about every hour it seemed to stop at various sites along the way. All of the stops were amazing and even just the scenery while driving was breath taking! After learning a lot about Morocco, eating lunch in front of the kasbah where they filmed Gladiator (so cool), climbing the kasbah, making argon oil, and so much more, we made it out to the desert! The Sahara is awesome! There we arrived at a camp where there was no one but one guy who works there. It was really cool! We rode camels around the dunes, watched the sunset, ate a delicious, homeade (by the two guides) meal, and watched for shooting stars (we saw 5!). In the morning we woke up to see the sunrise (worth it!) and headed back to Marrakech with stops along the way.I really hope to go back and stay longer because a weekend was just enough to fall in love with Morocco! Thank you so much to Top Desert for the trip of a lifetime! I posted some pictures too!"

We didn't expect such a great trip and specially the professionalism of TopDesert tour. During the reservation process we were always guided by Moha. He was very nice and he always answered all of our questions. Our guide Salah was a great guy. He was very respectful and even being the Ramadan days, he always respected us and let us have our snacks during the trip. Even though it was a long trip to the desert, he made several stops to take pictures, to have a coffe or a drink, to use a bathroom or to visit places of interest. This really helped us to stretch once in a while and made the trip much more confortable. Salah always looked for places with internet connection (Wi-Fi), so we could be in contact with our loved ones or to post pictures of our great adventure on Facebook :) The breakfasts and dinners included were delicious tipycal food. The hotel in Dades was phenomenal, the staff was great and the rooms were amazingly decorated and spotless clean. Sincerely, we didn't expect such a great night in the desert, even thought it was very hot during the night, we slept outside the tents under the sky and it was amazing (it is important to remember that a trip to the desert involves sand, high temperatures, bugs and a lot of adrenaline). The experience in the dunes was really magical. We highly recommended this tour. Salah, our guide, was professional, funny and respectful. Thank you Salah and thank you TopDesert tours."

            "review": "3 Day Erg Chebbi Desert Trip. We went on this tour last week. We booked the tour through Moha who answered all our emails and sent us detailed itineraries. Considering what seemed quite a high price for this tour (380 EUR per person), there were some problems. On the day we were picked up at our Riad by our guide (we think his name was Wahid, not sure how to spell it) and then went to meet our driver Rachid. On our way to the hotel for the first night we stopped at a lot of excellent viewpoints which were also good opportunities to stretch our legs as we naively had not realised how much travelling and sitting in the car was involved in the trip. We also stopped at a couple of kasbahs including Ait Benhaddou. We enjoyed these sights and walking round Ait Benhaddou, although felt that our guide did not give us a lot of information about the history of the places. We also stopped at the movie studios in Ouarzazate. Although we didn't want to do the hour-long tour here our guide told us we didn't have the time. This seemed a bit strange as we were then at our hotel for the night by 4:30!The hotel (Xaluca Dades) was fabulous, really nice with great facilities, food, and views. On the second day we also did lots of travelling and stopped and walked around a mosque and 2 spectacular gorges. We were glad to arrive at the desert and were welcomed with some mint tea on our arrival and then straight to our camel ride to watch the sunset. The camel ride in the dunes was amazing, the dunes were very impressive and the local berber guide for the camel ride was very knowledgeable and told us all about the animals he sees in the desert. This was the highlight of our tour. We slept in the tent and had an opportunity to sleep outside. We were told to be at breakfast at eight, at breakfast we were then informed by our guide that it was time to leave. We were confused at this as our itinerary had clearly said sandboarding in the morning which was one of the reasons we had booked this tour. Our guide said that if we had wanted to do the activity we shouldhave gotten up at five when the sand was cooler but this had not been explained to us. After discussion, our guide said that we could go off into the dunes alone to try sandboarding and found us one pair of skis between us to go and try out. This wasn't really what we had in mind as we had no idea what we were doing and were left to our own devices with one pair of skis (and no boots to fit them) between us. This was one of those 'amusingly bad' experiences. Although it was entertaining to see each other fall over on the dunes we were dissappointed to not have any guide, tutoring, or in fact boards for our sandboarding. We had emailed Moha before the trip to confirm with us that we would get the opportunity to try this activity as it may be a once in a lifetime opportunity for us. On the way back we stopped at more places to look at. Overall, we enjoyed the trip and found our guide and driver to be polite but did experience a communication barrier on a couple of occasions as we don't think our guide had understood what we had asked, and perhaps his English was slightly too limited to pass on local and historical knowledge. The dunes and the camel ride were amazing, as were the gorges en route, however we do feel that the itinerary should have been gone through with us by our guide so that everyone was clear on the activities etc. Missing out on a proper sandboarding experience was very disappointing."

Once at our destination we stopped for a meal, then Salah guided us to the summit at Ait Benhaddou. Stunning scenery and fierce heat, so remember to take plenty of water ! Lastly an hour camel ride along the dried up river bed. It felt very special coming back up towards the Kasbah as it loomed up out of the red sand. This is a long day trip (at least 6 hours in the 4x4) but was made entertaining by our hosts Salah and Rachid. We played word games, laughing both at our attempted solutions and at the antics of some of the other road users. Cost was 220 Euros for myself, wife and two teenagers. This was excellent value given the experience that was delivered, but a little long for those with younger children. Would I recommend? Definitely Yes"

It was excellent.I asked them to pick up my family, 2 adults, three large teenagers, at the Kasbah du Toubkal which is located at the base of the Atlas Mountains and 90kms from Marrakesch. (2 nights at this Kasbah, using a guide to go into the Toubkal National Park, highly recommended. Kasbah can arrange transfer from Marrkesch airport).Picked us up in a new, large 4x4 wheel car. With small people can fit 7, with us it was tight but comfortable. All luggage was carried on top of the car, covered with a canvas to avoid the dust and possible rain.We then drove 10 hours to M'Hamid! Our teenagers worst nightmare except that the trip was very interesting. First with the driver and guide who were from the Berber tribe and taught us a lot about the desert. Then we stopped on the way at fascinating places and locations including for lunch.Arrived at M'hamid by night only to find (to my horror) that I had booked the standard hotel (like a one star) instead of the luxury hotel (4 star). As it was my fault I asked them to take me to the 4 star note and I paid the extra charge which was not much. The luxury version of the hotel (you have to remember that M'Hamid is the last town before the deep desert was called Kazbah Azalay and we loved it. Next morning we drove for two hours into the fantastic desert. Started through a sand storm, lunch at an oasis, met berber people on the way and finally reached the impressive dunes where we camped. Moha, who is the person who organizes everything was constantly calling the team to make sure all was OK. The luxury campsite was fully booked so we had the standard campsite. We were able to look a luxury campsite on the way and were happy we got the standard. Luxury campsite si not by the really high dunes (where our kids were able to sand board!) Luxury campsite has a toilet in your tent, but personally I preferred to walk from our tents to a clean little house with several bathrooms. Our camp had approximately 20 tents, with people from all over the world. Food was good and at night we all sat around the campfire with Berber musicians entertaining us. Nights get cool but the (real ) beds in our tents had plenty of blankets. In the morning the must see thing is the sunrise. It is something out of this world. Go early and climb the highest dune for a view you will remember for the rest of your life. We only spent one night. We were able to have a camel ride that was real fun. Had we spent another night we could have explored the desert more and probably hired quads.Drove back through the amazing dried up lake and on the Paris Dakar rally trails. It is a long trip back to Marrakesch but you stop on the way and it was really worth it.I felt safe at all times. Our driver and guide were great."

It was a magical 48h, and we could not be happier with our experience. Take loads of bottle water, and be prepared to walk. Do it, you will not regret it!"

            "review": "Amazing 4 day (3 night) private tour from Marrakech to Erg Chigaga.. Just got back from an excellent trip with Top Desert from Marrakech to Erg Chigaga dunes camp. We're a family of 4 (children age 7&9). Our driver was Racheed who was excellent. A really good driver, so friendly & nice with the children too. He picked us up bang on time. Racheed spoke some English; enough to have little chats & find out where we were going to next etc. Those wanting historical details about the places visited might want a more fluent English speaker, but Racheed was perfect for us.Day 1 we travelled, with stops, for 11 hours. If I'd have read this before, I'd be put off but the stops are frequent and interesting, and the scenery is amazing and varied so we all found the journey fine. We visited an argan oil co-op, a couple of Kasbahs (Ait Benhaddou was excellent, great walk to top of hill, superb views - a good break from the driving). We appreciated the very quick look at the studios in Ouarzazate. Viewing from the outside was interesting enough.Riad Lamane in Zagora was brilliant - beautiful gardens etc. Wish we could have stayed longer.In fact, this bit was the only negative: Day 2, we left at 10am for a drive to M'Hamid, then hang around in a hot cafe for 3 hours waiting for it to cool down enough for the drive off road to Erg Chigaga camp. Would have been better to have an extra 2 hours at riad, (it has a pool that we had no time to use) and only stop in M'Hamid for 1 hour lunch. We had to work hard at keeping kids entertained playing cards etc at the cafe.It took nearly 3 hours of off road driving to reach camp. But it was absolutely worth it. The dunes are beautiful & I couldn't get enough of looking at them in the changing light of day/eve/night. Sandboarding was much fun. Take plenty of water - we could have done with more due to the exertion more than the heat.The camp itself was fab. We had one of about 10 tents. We had beds! And a door! Not what I expected. The marquee type communal tent was nice too, with tables & chairs. The toilets were basic as you'd expect in a desert with little/no water. Although there was a shower & sink it was very basic - take plenty of babywipes for freshening up etc. The food was good - lamb tagine one night, chicken another. Soup to start & fruit after. After dinner the fire was lit & we enjoyed 15mins of drumming & singing by the guys in the camp. Sunset was of course spent up on the dunes. Wow!Day 3 was spent chilling in the desert, as advised my Moha who we booked through. We initially wanted a 3 day trip but Moha thought the children would be better off with more time in the desert before the long car trip back. For us, this did work out best. This was largely due to the presence of a cat & 4 kittens in camp, which kept the kids entertained for hours. The morning was spent in camp, followed by several hours lazing under shade in an oasis 30 mins drive away. We had books, cards, played hopscotch etc so for us it was a nice chilled day but others might have been bored. At 5pm it was cool enough to return to camp for dromedary ride & more sandboarding. Much fun on both counts!Day 4 was the long drive back. We went a different route which was again, surprisingly interesting. We had a few stops: lunch, carpet co-op, Hills Have Eyes film location... but otherwise kept going & were back in Marrakech by 6pm.I'd really recommend top desert. Moha was pretty slick replying to queries by email before we booked. Racheed, our driver, was outstanding. Morocco itself is amazing and there is so much to see, its great to go with a company like Top Desert that take care of everything & obviously know what the are doing."

When we got to the camp they cooked for us traditional tajine with chicken and vegebtables and served warm tea whole night.The meal was very tasty. We really enjoyed spending 2 days with them!

We called Moha of Top Desert on very short notice, as we wanted to take a tour to Erg Chigaga from Zagora where we were staying. He was able to put a tour together that was perfect for us two. We were picked up by our french speaking driver Hussain from our Riad in Zagora, where he took us to the stunning dunes via M'hamid. The car was a comfortable 4x4, and Hussain clearly a great driver. We arrived at the basic, 10- tent camp that was shared with other guests and other companies, but as comfortable as it gets in the middle of the desert. (They also offer a more luxurious, private camp, but we opted for the shared camp for economical reasons) We took a dromedary ride for about an hour until sunset, which was amazing. The dinner that was prepared was tasty, and the drivers and guides then played us music under the stars. Bring warm pajamas or your own sleeping bag, because it gets very cold at night! Our english speaking guide Mourad joined us between M'Hamid and Erg Chigaga, very nice guy and fun to talk to. Including tips, we paid about 2300 dirham for the two day - one night trip, and it was worth every penny."

We arranged a 3 day / 2 night tour through Top Desert from Marrakech to the Sahara. The person who handles all of the arrangements (Moha) did an excellent job of communicating and setting up the tour for us over email. At first, we were only planning a 1 night tour to the Tinfou dunes but Moha strongly suggested a 2 night tour to the Erg Chegaga dunes. This is the BEST advice we could have received. We drove past the Tinfou \"dunes\" for the 1 night tour and then I totally understood why he strongly suggested a 2 night tour or longer. I think we would have been really disappointed if we only did the 1 night tour.Our tour guide (Abdul) was absolutely amazing. We spent 3 full days with him and could not have been more happy. The first day and the last day were long days of driving including windy roads through the mountains and offroad driving in the desert. We made nice stops along the way which were very interesting to see and learn about. But for sure the highlight is the time in the desert. Abdul was absolutely fantastic and took such great care of us! It was all perfect! I cannot recommend this tour enough.One last note, my wife and I have a 1 year old child and we were very glad that we left him at home with his grandparents for this trip. It is a lot of driving including offroad driving through the desert. This was so fun for us but definitely better for couples and/or families with older children."

Yes, 12 days all over Morocco, with meet-ups in Rabat to pick up and drop off my son. I made all arrangements with Moha via e-mail. My son lives in Rabat and we are in the USA. There were quite a few places my son wanted us to visit. Moha met every challenge I gave him without a hitch and filled in the rest of our vacation with a wonderful assortment of experiences. We didn't have to worry about a thing from the time our driver picked us up at the airport until the end of our tour. They took care of every detail. All accommodations were perfect, travel arrangements were perfect, desert trip was perfect. If it had not rained in Fez, I would have guessed that Moha even arranged the weather for us!!! Moha was a most gracious person to deal with and he went out of his way to meet our requests and make us feel so welcomed in his country. Our guide and driver, Abdoul, was awesome! He was polite and helpful in every way, almost sensing our needs and yet he was never intrusive. He was knowledgeable and answered all our questions. He seemed to know exactly when we needed a break - pulling over to the side of the road for a fantastic view or to stop for a cup of tea. He was a wonderful driver as well, especially through the Atlas mountains (breath-taking views along with breath-taking curves). He recommended fantastic places to eat, shop or just take a walk. He even took us on a late night run to the store and found us some camel milk! He is such a patient person with a great sense of humor. He was always smiling! It was such a pleasure to have him with us on our journey! Moha also set us up with a local guide, Syed, in the old city of Marrakesh. Syed was great and is very knowledgeable! He explained many of the nuances of Moroccan culture and customs along with traditions and their roots. We also had a local guide in Fez.I just can't say enough about Top Desert. All of the staff we worked with were kind, generous, patient and AWESOME! They took care of everything for us. Moha always responded quickly when we were in the planning stages. We had absolutely no problems. I think we traveled about 2000km and the car (4x4) was very comfortable. Abdoul was an excellent and safe driver. All of the riads they reserved for us were great. The excursions and experiences we had will last us a lifetime!"

The guides were knowledgeable, friendly and did everything to accomodate our needs (they kept on asking if it was ok for my wife).While likely not the cheapest outfit out there, you will get a very reliable company that will deliver a fantastic, no-bad-surprises trip."

From Marrakech we really wanted to go into the desert but didn't have that much time. Top Desert arranged a trip that was perfect for our needs. It was easily arranged and we were taken care of the whole time. Our driver into the desert (Mahjoub) was excellent and the scenery was gorgeous. He was very friendly and we learnt so much about Moroccan culture and people. Driving through the High Atlas Mountains and seeing how Moroccans live there was unbelievable. Our time in the desert was beautiful, even though we didn't go that far into the Sahara. Everyone took care of us and it was (almost) the best accommodations of our trip, considering we were in the desert. It was a very unique experience and gave us a whole different view of Morocco. The sunset and sunrise was gorgeous and we spent the night around the campfire listening to the staff sing and play instruments. It is definitely an incredible experience that is worth trying out when visiting Morocco. I would recommend going farther into the desert and taking two to three days if you want a more real experience of the desert. I would definitely go again with Top Desert and I hope to do so again in the future. They have many options available and are happy to help you find the right one for you."

Moha also arranged a separate guide, Said, who guided us around the Medina for the only afternoon we had available in Marrakech. He was a wealth of knowledge and looked after our every need and we felt very safe with him. He also showed us how to find our way to and from our riad, at our request, and we would highly recommend Said to anyone who wanted to hear about some of the history of Marrakech.

We had an excellent time with our great guides, Abdoul and Majoub (2 comfy aircon cars) who accommodated many photo stops. They turned up at our Riad on time and returned us efficiently to a well hidden riad on our return to Marrakech.The journey south took us through fantastic scenery and we ate typical tasty Moroccan food. We over nighted in a secluded desert camp site (south of Foum-Zguid), accessed by camel ride into the sunset.A simple meal was followed by a berber jam session, with a bit of Les Mis from our kids. We slept under the stunning desert stars as the tents were too hot, although our concerns of night crawlers were not realised. Be aware of the sand getting under the sheets though if the wind picks up! We all watched the sunrise whilst attempting dune surfing, followed by a second camel trek as the sun rose further over the mountains. Breakfast, showers and a swim at a nearby hotel was greatly appreciated.The outward trip over the high Atlas mountains visited the remote but beautiful Kazbah Des Glaoui at Telouet, still decked in stunning original mosaic (similar to India's Agra style), not expected from the outside image of a semi ruin. The return trip took us through scenery as stunning as the Utah desert. Our short trip did not allow an extended visit to Ait Ben Haddou although we passed by and stopped for lunch. 2 other stops allowed for rug buying and Argan oil testing.Thank you to Abdoul and Majoub for an exciting and cultural trip!"

After a long time surfing on the internet we booked our 4 day trip to the desert with Top Desert. There are so many tour operators who offer you trips to the Sahara what makes it difficult to pick one. When we planned our vacation to Morocco and the excursion we had some questions, and Moha helped us by email before we booked our desert trip. That gave us a very good idea about the organisation. They helped you wherever they could.Abdoul was our driver and guide during the four days and we liked him all very much. Great sence of humour, a perfect driver and he thought a lot about the wishes of our four children! He told us a lot about Morocco, his culture and living in the desert. He knew the most beautiful views for the photo's and he showed us a lot of amazing places.Near Erg Chebbi, we stopped at a well where the children could get water for the camels to drink, they were resting in the sun. It was a magnificent and refreshing moment! Now we are back home, one of the best memories left of our wonderful vacation.The camel ride to see the sunset, the colours of the Sahara, sleeping under the stars and even a little sandstorm made our desert experience complete and very special. It was a magical evening and night in the desert. Abdoul, his colleague Lachzen and some boys who work their made Berber music for us, and we tried to played some instruments and although we have to confess we are bad musicians, we joined and made a lot of fun, and even learned a Berber dance, It was a perfect evening in the desert.We are so glad that we chose Top Desert!

Without a second thought we will book a tour by Top Desert again !!!!Abdoul, thanks again, we will never forget this wonderful trip!"

            "review": "Best treatment in the desert a girl could ask for!. From the moment I contacted Abdu via email at the recommendation of a co-worker, he responded quickly and professionally. Even though I was a solo traveller, and he couldn't find another group for me to go with, he arranged a private trip for me within my budget. I was worried about my safety since I was traveling alone so he personally came to the Riad I was staying at to explain everything to me. He made me feel so comfortable which was a breath of fresh air after how I was treated by the taxistas, people in the Souks and in the streets of Marrakesh. He arranged for his brother Rachid to take me on the 3 day tour to the desert and back, door to door service. Rachid was amazing! He stopped at all the great places to take pictures and he always had my comfort and well-being in mind. He speaks several languages (Berber, Arabic, French and Spanish) and was well-versed in the areas we travelled through. After going through several cool cities and seeing century old Kasbahs, we arrived to the Gorges du Dades and stayed the night at the lovely Albuerge Chez Pierre. The people there were equally kind to me and the meals were fabulous! The next day, when we arrived at the desert, the people Rachid and Abdu work with were so also nice and hospitable. I was so impressed with the sheer beauty and serenity of the area. Everything everybody says about this particular 3-day trip is true, so many gorgeous things to see and eat! I would HIGHLY recommend this tour with Rachid and/or Abdu without a single doubt in my mind! I loved every single minute of it and am so glad I chose them!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~On another note, after telling Rachid all about my bad experiences walking around Marrakesh alone, he accompanied me everywhere! I am so incredibly thankful for what I consider \"special treatment\" because it renewed my faith in the people and diminished every single awful experience I had. Wonderful, exceptional treatment like none other, thank you SO much for everything guys!"

Incredibly safe driving taking into account the curvie and narrow roads etc. The site is what is is, but thumbs up for vehicle and the drive....and his music, Tinariwen from Mali, simply top notch crusing the 4 hours from A to B. Pricey yes, You can get cheaper locals for 40% off if knowing the right people, but then again if you pay peanuts you get monkeys."

The southern oasis route and desert dunes were the highlight. We very much appreciated that Abdel asked us to dine with the other Berbers after we asked to cook a tagine together. We will always have fond memories."

I booked a trip with these guys as a single woman going alone into the desert for 3 days 2 night private tour with sandboarding, camel riding, and into the desert tent camp. They met me the night before we left at my hotel and we discussed plans, concerns, and travel arrangements. They picked me up the next day in a beautiful Land Rover. Their English is great for discussing the country and culture. We travelled a long distance to the first town, where we had beautiful accomodations in a gorgeous riad. The second day we went into the heart of the desert and stayed at a magical tent camp with delicious food and memories I'll never forget. Halfway through the trip, I realized I was no longer traveling alone... I was traveling with friends. These 2 guys, Moha and Abdou, are amazing... good friends who have gone in together to create a top notch business that provides a magical experience for their customers. I felt safe and cared for the entire trip. We would stop on the way when we'd see something neat on the side of the road. I'd recommend this company to anyone and can't wait until I can get back to Morocco so I can book another adventure with them. Highly, highly recommended!"

            "review": "Fantastic!. We travelled to the Sahara Desert on the Zagora 2 day and one night trip with 'Splash Morocco'. It was an unforgettable experience. We travelled on a small relatively well air conditioned mini bus with 9 other people and our guide. The trip to the desert took 12 hours by bus and 2 hours on a camel. The journey out to the desert involved many stops to take pictures and for toilet breaks. On arrival to the desert we were welcomed with mint tea and a lovely tagine supper. We then spent hours lying under the stars before heading to sleep in our tent which we shared with another couple. We visited in June and at night the desert was still really hot and the temperature in our tent was quite uncomfortable, so don't worry about taking warm clothing with you. We woke at 6am to watch a beautiful sunrise and then headed back on the camels for one hour where we met the main road and our guide was waiting for us. The journey home took approximately 6 hours. All the roads to and from Zagora are very winding and I would recommend anti sickness for anyone who suffers from travel sickness. There are lots of opportunities to buy water along the way, and it's not necessary to purchase a cloth to wear as a head scarf when riding the camels, regardless of how much it is insisted on. Overall this was an absolutely amazing trip and I would recommend it to everyone as a must do tour whilt in morocco."

They were very professional tour guides who tailor made the experience for us. Unlike other tours we searched, Abdul and his team were able to accommodate our short time frame and still pack so much in only 3 days/2 nights. They were efficient and were always conscious of our time and making sure we saw and did as much as we could within the time we had. We wouldn't have been able to experience so much if it weren't for their expertise and thoughtfulness.They were so knowledgeable of the localities and local people which made our experience all the more authentic and memorable. Lastly, they were highly attentive to our needs and made sure at all times that we were comfortable. We highly recommend Desert Tour for an unforgettable experience of the desert.

He went to the trouble of letting me connect to his Internet and then calling the person we're staying with. I cannot thank him enough. All of the people at the shop are wonderful. They even invited us to break fast with them, which made me feel like I could really get involved with the Morrocan culture. The mint tea is beautiful, the best in the medina. We did the tour to Vallee Ourika which was perfect for our short stay in Marrakech as it's only around an hour to drive. We went to a traditional Berber house to have tea and bread and honey. We then went to the place where they make Argon oil and a lovely girl told us all the history in English. It is expected that you tip, so make sure you have some small notes.The lunch down by the river was traditional Morrocan cuisine and was tasty. I paddled in the river which was incredibly refreshing, and the service was good.We then drove to the waterfall, it was stunning. Take a bathing costume because you can swim, although it's so cold. Suitable footwear needed for the rocky terrain, not good for kids or the elderly. It is beautiful. Lovely photo opportunity and great way to cool off after the 20 minute climb in 40 degree heat. Our driver, Abdul was fantastic. Even though it is Ramadan, you wouldn't know. He was informative and friendly. Excellent driver and it was a comfortable car. He also took photos for us with our camera.Overall I really enjoyed it, and it was very reasonably priced compared with the competitors both online and around the medina. Thank you!"

We were a little nervous about going on desert tours with guys we didn't really know so we hesitated to book a 2 or 3 day excursion. After a few days of bumping into them regularly, and drinking lots of Berber tea, we got brave and tried a day tour. We had an excellent day touring the mountains and exploring a berber village and house, eating lunch in a riverside restaurant and visiting a women's cooperative that produces argan oil products. We got a little braver and looked at the photos and itinerary for the longer tours and decided to go. Unfortunately before we could book I got sick, and these guys offered us help and support every day, checking to see how I was and offering advice. We came away with new friends and will definitely be going back to spend some proper time in the desert with them. Thank you Mabrouk, Mohamed and Hossam"

With us 5 girls, he was like a father-figure to us. He was friendly, very kind, took very good care of us and entertained all of our requests, however silly there were (like asking to drive us to a cheaper place to eat when we were already seated in a fancy-ish restaurant). 8 days with him was very fun and we were very sad when he had to leave to go back to Marrakech. At first I was a bit reluctant to go on a trip with this tour but it was worth every penny and I highly recommend for anyone who wishes to travel to Morocco to go with this company. I am planning to go to Morocco again with my family in the future and I would definitely go with Morhara Morocco Tours again!"

The accommodation that was booked is really good and comfortable with a delicious breakfast everyday. Omar, our tour guide is a friendly and funny tour guide who make us feel like we are travelling with our own family member! Although the trip from one place to another place is quite far and required us to spend a lot of time in the car, we feel relaxed as the tour is flexible and we do not need to rush to follow the itinerary as the itinerary is well prepared by the tours. Besides, we really enjoy the scenery from Atlas Mountain which is covered with snow to the dunes of Sahara Desert as Omar would pull over for us to take picture of the beautiful scenery and he would tell us a bit about the places that we stop. The camel rides and star gazing experience in the Sahara Desert is really enjoyable and beautiful! Hassan also take care of our well being by contacting us once a time to make sure that we get all the things we need. I will recommend this tour to my friends as it is worth the money that we spend with the experience that we got during this trip. Overall, I really enjoyed and glad that I had pick this tour to organize my trip in Morocco."

I am fully satisfied from the very moment we arrived at the Marakkech Airport till the last moment. ( Marakech Airport straight to Casablanca-Rabat(did not sleep there)-Fes-Sahara-Todgha-Marakech)Our guides Hassan and Umar are the best. They brought us to the wonderful places and always being flexible in choosing our destination in each places. They also tend to discuss with us about the destination and always recommend the best.Nabil, our guide in Fes is the best and lovely. He knows every single thing in Fes so dont worry you wouldnt leave that place without knowing nothing and he also helped us a lot shopping there. Instead he was the one who help us to bargain the prices and like i said he knows the best about Fes. So we did get the good prices with a very high quality goods. Next is Sahara Desert. We supposed to arrived there from Fes before sunset but we couldnt make it because it's winter time and sun tend to set faster. It take 7 hours for you to arrive in Sahara from Fes, but we couldnt make it as we stop at few beautiful places otw to sahara. But then we still can ride the camel while watching sunrise as we went to the camp by jeep and went back to the hotel with camel the next day. So it does make your life easier as it is flexible. Todgha Gorges also beautiful. You can get the feel of living at small villages between the big mountain with the sound of river from your room. Brothers at Sahara Desert Camp are wonderful. They welcomed you from the moment where you arrived and guide you to the tent and have dinner a together. If you are same like me, dont worry there is toilet in the desert. They set a bonfire and played their traditional songs i guess. Stragazing at Sahara is the best. It is not a scenery that you can capture with camera.Go and look on your own! Riding camel also one of the best memory :)So if you chose to go with Morahara, Do include Sahara Desert cause our original plan did not include sahara, but we asked to. So basically you can create the tour based on what you like and they will recommend what is the best. So after all, i can say that i am really satisfied with the Morhara Travel and it worth every penny you paid. We were so sad when leaving Morocco and it has been 4 days since we arrived in UK, but we are still missing Morooco. The hotels we stayed also gave the best services.Beautiful country with the kind hearted people, family. #CouscousSisters #SevenSisters"

Nabil (our tour guide in Fes) is the best guide ever!! Really fluent in English, and he knows the history in Fes in and out especially the Old Medina. Really recommended! He bring us to tanneries, potteries, handmade weaving place, University al Qarawiyyin (oldest university in the world), maqaam of well known scholars in Fes and many different shops in the Old Medina. He even brought us to Nejjarine Restaurant in old Medina. The chicken tagine is so delicious! Thank you from 7 sisters from Malaysia to Nabil for the amazing whole day in Fes. An overnight in Sahara desert and camel riding was amazing as well! The campsite was great and very convenient! The food and brothers in the campsite is friendly and great as well. And please take care of us beige cap that I reckon misplaced and left in the campsite Abdul Salam (our tour guide in Marrakesh) is great as well. Always laughing and cheering us. He brings us to all different places with full explanations of history. But sadly due to limited time we haven't had to explore more in Marrakesh. Surely we might need to come back to explore more insyaAllah Hassan and Umar are a very great host! They treat us like fathers. Excellent driving skills with long hours drive especially in the Atlas mountain and throughout the journey from Sahara to Todgha Gorge. All the accommodation is very excellent!! Really convenient and exceed our expectation. Maamoura Hotel in Casablanca, Hotel Blue Sky in Fes, Kenneria Hotel in Marrakesh, Dar Ayour guesthouse in Todgha Gorge. Overall is very amazing! Really recommended!! Thanks Hassan and Umar for a very great journey together with 7 sisters from Malaysia =) #7couscoussisters"

They are super friendly and really took care of us. We had Nabil as our guide in Fes (Awesome guy) and Abdul Salam in Marrakech. The accomodations in every city, as well as in Sahara, are better that I expected.The downsides: We didn't get to go to some of the places stated in the itinerary, especially in Marrakech. And one time in Fes they took us to an expensive restaurant for dinner. So I think you better tell the guides before hand, what are your price range for food.But other than that, everything was just amazing. The trip went smoothly and surprisingly quick. 8 days are not enough for me. I wish I could stay longer :( Will deffo come again soon. Mor'hara FTW!"

I decided just for a short day trip upon his recommendation to the valley of Ourika and the waterfall in a small group. Well organized I was picked up without delay with a few other people - which turned out to become a lovely group. On the way the driver was always ready for a short stop to take a few shots to inhale the breath taking beauty of the mountain side in autumn in its golden colors. We stopped for good in Si Fatme where a local guide led us up to the waterfalls, always kindly supportive and patient for taking a view around, taking photos or just absorbing the beauty of this landscape - there are many photos on google images giving an idea about it, but the air, the breeze, the colors, the pure nature is much more beautiful than one might guess. I felt very grateful for this advise of this day trip!!! The lunch, taken at the river side was delicious and the tour back was very calm as everyone had to cope with the flood of impressions and the ravishingly beautiful landscape just before sunset. I felt very encouraged to go for more tours, but as my holidays had come to an end I can only count for the day to return and do more tours organised by Mor'hara. Marrakesh by itself is enchanting - but these day trips or tours are opening doors to a different quality of Morocco!! I'll be back soon!!"

My boyfriend and I were staying in Marrakech for a few days and by chance came cross the Mor'hara Tours shop when walking through the Souks on our first day. We are from Scotland and we were astounded to learn the company's Scottish connections, it was definitely fate! They were so friendly and welcoming and invited us to join them for a lovely mint tea in their little shop. There are many different tour options from day tours to the coast or longer tours to the Sahara. As we only had a couple of days we decided on a day trip to Essaouira as we fancied a visit to the beach.The team were so flexible and helpful, as Hassan offered to meet us at our Riad in the morning so he could take us round to his jeep. We had a fantastic day at the coast and stopped along the way to visit the goats in the trees, an argan oil co-operative and we also paid a visit to the village where Jimi Hendrix lived in 1969.Lunch was absolutely fabulous. We told Hassan we loved fish so he took us to the port to pick up some fresh fish, and some bread and salad from the markets. The food was then cooked and served to us on a roof terrace with mint tea and fresh fruit. Delicious! Hassan is a very good driver and we felt very safe with him, especially when arriving back in Marrakech during rush hour (that was an experience in itself!).The guys are so hospitable and I cannot recommend them enough. We met and had tea with them a few more times before our departure a few days ago. As Mubarak said, it is a small shop with a big heart.

I cannot praise Liz from Mo'hara Morocco Tours highly enough as she put up with way too many emails from me and always promptly replied with helpful advice and suggestions. Patient Hassan was my tour guide who put up with my never ending chase of that one brilliant photograph and my constant cry of \"stop here\" for that elusive photo opportunity I didn't want to miss. My trip with Hassan was from Marrakech to Zagora and out to the desert. His English is good, his driving is excellent and his care factor to ensure that the client has an enjoyable time is his priority. The overnight desert trip was simply amazing. Sleeping outside under the stars and waking to the eerie silence of a rose-colored vision of endless sand was a breath taking experience. I would definitely recommend Mo'hara Morocco Tours to anyone contemplating a tour of any type, as they will tailor a tour to suit your budget and your taste, promptly and efficiently. And, friendly Hassan will definitely look after you and share his cultural heritage."

We met Mohamed, the director and owner of the Marrakech Travel Services, in his modest office and were instantly warmed to him and his team's attentive and professional approach to our travel requests. We wanted to make a day trip into the Atlas Mountains and Ourika valley but also requested to make a stopover at the famous Richard Branson owned hotel called Kasbah Tamadot to enjoy lunch whilst soaking up the amazing panoramic views of the mountains. This section of the trip was not part of their regular excursion route but Mohamed was happy to accommodate and assured us this would not be a problem. He said he would explain everything about the modified route to his driver ahead of the trip the next morning. My wife and I were picked up promptly the following day from our hotel by his courteous and professional driver & guide Abdellah. He had obviously spoken to Mohamed, as promised, as there was a clear understanding and no confusion of our intended itinerary at the outset. The minivan was air-conditioned, clean and comfortable which was important for the long day ahead. Abdellah, himself born and brought up as a Berber, kept us informed and entertained during our journey with his occasional amusing quips about the Berber taxis (mules) Berber Wembley stadium (a small sandy make-shift soccer pitch) and Berber McDonald's (a lone roadside meat vendor)!!Our visit into the Berber village, across the mountains and back to Marrakech was very smooth with occasional strategic stops for photographs. We returned with fond memories of life in the mountains. We felt confident and safe with our driver throughout the day and would have no hesitation in recommending Mohamed and his team at Marrakech Travel Services to our friends and family for future reservations. Thank you and hope to see you all again in Marrakech soon. Dr Sanjay Gupta"

A lot of people who we were on the tour with were complaining because they were charged 80 euros. The waterfall is beautiful and we even had the opportunity to take photos with the monkeys and go on a bamboo raft boat so that we could get closer to the waterfall. Keep in mind though that the guide is not included and you have to pay 3 euros extra for him. Overall, I would definitely recommend this day trip if you want to experience something different to Marrakech and if you don't mind to hike."

We were sold the 3n2d over the 1 night trip because we were told you get to see more of the real desert. Whilst I can't really compare the two types of tour having only done one, I did feel disappointed that our camel ride was only 40 mins rather than the 1hr and a half - 2hrs as we'd been told. We didn't set off until almost sunset and left before sunrise which felt like not much time considering we spent nearly 2 days getting there!It seems that MTS provide the transport and the driver and the driver arranges the rest of the tour en route. I found the lunches overpriced and I would have liked to have learnt more about the desert and even the camels ! None the less, we saw lots on the way And got to sleep out under the stars. "

We noticed this group have really good reviews so we thought we'd try them out, rather than spending a fortune at our hotel for excursions. It was an easy 15 min walk from our hotel, sofitel, to find the marrakesh travel service office. You can also take a 5 min taxi drive to the office, which costs around 15/25d to get there. We met Abdullah and Ali there where we discussed some excursion options. They were really helpful and offered us three excursions at a very good price. All in all we payed 1,250d for the full day Atlas mountain trek, half day walking city tour with guide and the half day quad biking. where we chose to have one quad for us both and swapped half way because it worked out cheaper. Excluding the walking tour where we met the guide at the travel office, Ali or Abdullah would promptly pick us up from the hotel, along with the driver, at the time specified (they were always early). We had a fantastic time on all of the excursions, all of the guides and drivers made us feel comfortable, they are very trustworthy and they all have fluent knowledge of many languages, mostly European. If you want to go to the souks and the square without any hassle, we definitely recommend making use of the guide, our tour guide was called Mohammid, as they know the local language as well as people within the souks therefore yoy can geberally get the best price for whatever you want to buy.Overall, we would highly recommend, especially if you dont want to be ripped off for excursions by your hotel.

On our first day we actually went to the office in medina and booked this trip. We were greeted by friendly faces and we were looking forward to the trip ahead. I had researched this 3D2N tours extensively before coming and realized there are many companies which provide this tour. Some are quite cheap and some are quite expensive. This seemed to be a mid range option and with all the good reviews, it seemed like a easy choice. We were picked up right on time and taken to a minivan in the square. The minivan went a short distance to pickup other people and then the 3D2N people were asked to change vans. We thought this was a bit odd as our company agent dropped us to the first van.The new van was fine with AC and we had around 18 people which was pretty comfortable as it could seat 20. However as we started to chat with everyone, we realized that most of them were from hostels in Medina and had booked their tour directly from the hostels through various different tour companies and had paid the cheaper rate of about \u00a365-70 Euros. We soon began to realize that there is no difference between the cheaper and mid range option of these tours. It's seems like all the companies group the customers together when it's not so busy so there is no point in paying a premium. As such, our driver was very nice however, spoke little English and gave very little guidance about the plan of each day. Also, when we booked we were told that we would be making 5-6 stops along the way to see different sites. Of these, we actually only did three. However the three we did were really amazing which was the Ksar of Ait Ben haddou, the gorge and the visit to a berber family. We had local guides which was great. They did ask for tips but that's expected in morocco.The desert part of the tour was simply amazing and a great experience. The camel rides are only 1 hour each but that's more than enough time to appreciate the ride and enjoy the view. After 1 hr on the camels you will be happy to arrive trust me! The camp is quite basic but comfortable for one nights sleep. Don't expect to shower or feel clean however the food was great and the bathrooms were surprisingly clean. The Berber hosts were really great and made the night. The drive back is very long as per all the other reviews! But given how far you have to go, it's kind of expected. I didn't mind the traveling however I didn't appreciate the lunch stops along the way. We were taken to restaurants in the middle of nowhere even though we drove past several town centers along the way. Their prices ranged between 90-130 dirhams per meal. The food wasn't bad, however I didn't like how we were forced to eat here because we had no other choice. These places are made for tourists. But I think that's their plan. Overall, we really did enjoy the desert experience and would still recommend this tour, however we do feel slightly ripped off and cheated. Unfortunately I wouldn't book through this company again because you will be paying a premium for no reason. There are many other places to book for cheaper and you will all be grouped into the same tour."

The Berber villages were every bit exotic as I could have dreamed and it really felt like a setting for Game of Thrones."

They warned the tour operator that I am intolerant to gluten and our tour guide also warned people responsible for food in hotel/camp. I recommend brining your own gluten free bread or rice cakes to the trip, for everything else it was taken care of. In restaurants for lunch you have plenty of options so GF lunch is not a problem.In case of a solo traveller or a single-sex couple travelling together, you might get another person in your room on the first night in hotel. So if you don't want to share, make sure that agency confirms private room (for me it was at no cost). For the second night you don't have much of a choice, you will (most probably) have to share the tent :)You can leave your stuff in the minivan, so I recommend taking an additional smaller backpack for repacking for the night in the desert.Don't expect too much of other than Sahara or A\u00eft Ben Haddou - you get to see these two pretty well; in other cities you only make a short stop or only drive through."

However, the agency should inform you about the real conditions. The first hotel was really basic, in fact we were really cold, see the pictures. People were nice, friendly, but I was expecting something better, specially because I know people that did the same trip with another agency and stayed in a hotel with more facilities. For the desert, we were told that we would stay in one tent alone, and we had to share it with other 2 couples. Please go prepared to a really basic structure. They also told us that the cost covered 3 hours of camel riding, 1:30 in the sunset and then 1:30 in the sunrise. In fact, it's just 30 minutes. I suppose 1:30 it's to much, but just did not liked that they did not gave us the right information. All in all, it was a good experience, specially because the group was really good!"

We were told that there would be a gentle 40 minute walk to see spectacular waterfalls. Suitable attired with tough walking boots, we scrambled over extremely rough rocky terrain for about 20 minutes at which point sadly I started to feel unwell (? Altitude sickness). We decided not to continue and returned to base alone. When the group returned from the waterfall, many of the participants who were considerably younger than us said they really struggled as the \"walk\" became extremely steep, rocky and hazardous. At the end of the tour, the guide was very blatant in his request and expectation of a tip. As Europeans we found this very embarrassing. I it was however an interesting tour and good value for money. Stout walking shoes or boots essential."

You could do it with your own rented car but might feel somewhat lost along the way and it is quite nice to have a (already paid) guide and dinner waiting for you.Winter is a good time to visit: Less tourists and less heat, but do bring a jacket and scarf for the evenings and dessert night."

Even before arriving in Morocco I already had a good impression about marrakesh travel services. I emailed back and forth with Mr. Abdellah who answered every single one of my questions. He gave me all the details and confirmations I needed and was always very quick to reply back. I hoped that this same type of good service and attentiveness would be apparent on the tour itself. I must say I was definitely not disappointed! Mr Ali, who is one of the main organizers of the trip, arranged a pickup for me from the airport. Not only that but he also walked me all the way to the doorstep of my hotel. As a first time solo traveler who was anxious and a bit uncertain it was nice to have someone who was willing to lead the way which made me feel much more at ease. He was very nice and welcoming.The next day was the pickup to start the drive towards the Dades gorges. I had booked a 3 day trip to the desert. Along the way there were stops to take pictures of the many beautiful landscapes that were truly amazing. The tour of Ait Benhaddou was very informative and interesting. It was a filming location for movies/shows like gladiator, the mummy and game of thrones which was cool. The hotel we stayed at was nice and we were served a delicious meal that night which was a great way to end the day. The next day we visited a berber village and were invited into their home to drink tea and see how the intricate carpets are made by hand. Later that day we arrived at the much anticipated location, the sahara desert! We hopped on our camels and made our way through the dunes and enjoyed a beautiful sunset. Later on we arrived at our camping site where we enjoyed some delicious food and sat by the campfire. The next morning we hopped back on our camels to our transportation and drove back to the city of Marrakech. The driver of the tourbus was good at safely maneuvering around the winding roads along the mountains. He also spoke four different languages which meant he could communicate with everyone in our group!I definitely would recommend this trip. I had a wonderful time and memories that will last me a lifetime. You definitely will not be dissapointed!"

He was rude to me and my wife in front of all the passengers when I brought orange juice into the minibus, saying \"this is not a hotel or a restaurant\". Also when we stopped for a bathroom break and we didn't want to come out to use the bathroom, he insisted we all leave the minibus and locked the doors, leaving us outside waiting for about 10-15 minutes while he disappeared. He also made some remarks about us being from a particular South Asian country in what we perceived to be in a derogatory manner, even though we aren't even from that country and he'd never asked us where we were from - not appreciated!Nevertheless, the company itself, especially the agent Ali who we used, were very nice and I'd recommend the company."

The highlight of the tour was the hike to the cascades. It was a difficult hike for me, but many of the views are simply stunning. You will feel a great sense of achievement once the bottom of the cascades is reached.

Both times went really smoothly & our guide at the Cascades was very good. On the Essouira trip we stopped off at a cooperative where women made Argan oil & got to see how it was made. We were then free to do what we wanted at the town & got driven back later. Extremely reasonably priced, very happy!"

First we went on a tour with some other company, but we didn't feel safe, because the driver was most of the time on a phone, even writting and reading during driving a very narrow road. Also a car was in bad condition.So we looked for another company and we were very lucky to find Marrakesh Travel Services with its manager Mohamed. He tried to do his best to pleasure us. He gave us his probably best driver Mohamed, who was not only a driver, but also a very good (personal) guide. Also we got a very good car. Usually you have to pay for a guide with personal guide around 100 EUR/person, but a cost of a trip is much lower when you take just a driver. But as I mentioned our driver Mohamed was better guide than a professional (official) we took for a city tour in Marrakech. We took 2 trips: first to Essaouira, a beautiful city on a cost. The cost was 25 EUR/person for a whole day trip. Second day we took a trip to Ouarzazate with a highlight of a trip, a special place called Ksar of Ait-Ben-Haddou. But before you come to this place it takes a very, very long (4 hours on way) adventurous drive over Atlas Mountains, but is definitely worth it. This whole trip cost us 30 EUR/person. Children payed half price. Despite a dangerous road we felt very safe in hands of our friend Mohamed.We would definitely recommend this company since you get almost a personal tour for the price of ride only. And with that, they give you 1.000 smiles."

When we arrived in the Sahara desert, our camels were waiting for us and we rode them about an hour to the camp site. The camp site far exceeded our expectations. Groups of four shared a spacious tent with beds and they even had electrical plugs in them. Once we settled in, we listened to live moroccan music and ate traditional tagine. The musicians performed and danced for us all night, I will never forget this amazing experience. Our tour guide \"brother raad\" was extremely accomodating and he even invited us to a surprise dinner with his boss after we returned to Marrakesh. I would highly recommend this trip and it was well worth the money. - Carly (Semester at Sea)"

I had to prepare a big bundel of fruit for my self because the restaurant sell carbo and meat and less vegetable. I need more. Drink much water is very recommended eventhough you are not thirsty.In the afternoon, we arrived in Sahara. We were riding one hump camel about 1h to the tend where we stay. For experience, it was a bit hard but excited. There is a bathroom and toilet for man and woman, each. Dinner was good. The music was good and special.

Khalid collected me on time from my riad and we started the tour, wandering, walking, chatting about Marrakech and Morocco. I am a solo female traveler and was a bit nervous about going to Marrakech after reading various reviews but Khalid advised and said it is quite safe and during the tour he was right! He made me feel safe and secure, wandering amongst the Souks and streets and his knowledge is very impressive. I wanted to see architecture and art and Khalid showed me exactly that, with knowledge to match. Khalid recommended a place for lunch and left me to decide on the great cuisines available at Kui-Zin. The service was fabulous, as was the food, a very chilled and relaxed place for lunch. Khalid came back and we started our walk again, as the day was coming to an end he dropped me back at my riad and bid me farewell. Khalid was an amazing guide from his knowledge, insights and SO many locals welcome him along the way, he is very well known and respected. I highly recommend Khalid as your guide, he has a passion for people and his country. Fantastic memories, shukraan!"

Over the course of the tour, he impressed us with his knowledge, intelligence, humor and great warmth. During our 8 days in Morocco we interacted with 5 different tour guides, and Khalid was by far the best.Khalid picked us up at our riad and surprised us with a lovely small gift. During the tour, he showed us \"secrets of the medina\" that we truly could not have uncovered on our own, and filled every moment with facts and stories that helped us better understand the city. He never seemed to get tired of my endless questions, and was more than happy to discuss not just the history and monuments, but also the faith, politics and culture that make Marrakech a vibrant and fascinating place.And unlike many city guides, Khalid did not once attempt to introduce us to any shopkeepers or entice us to go shopping. He is running a cultural tour, not a guided shopping tour, and is clearly very principled in sticking to that, which made me very happy.It's very difficult to find independent guides like Khalid in Morocco. The tourist economy seems to be composed of a vast pool of guides who bounce around between an equally vast network of tour agencies, offering a ramshackle array of tours without ever developing expertise in one particular location. It's actually quite hard to rely on reviews because it's so rare that the guide you've read about in one review will be the guide you have when you sign up for a tour with an agency. Khalid's tours stand apart because he operates independently, he is from Marrakech, and he clearly knows and loves his city. The combination makes for an exceptional guided tour. You won't regret taking a tour with Khalid!"

Plus he kindly gave us to sweet mint tea to try and also some moroccan olive oil an marmalade, which was appreciated. You can maybe get cheaper tour-guides but we highly recommend Khalid for a guide who truly cares about his work and providing a 1st class experience."

Now that the tour-guide services referenced in this review have a website, I can happily describe our experience with a walking-tour guide during a visit to Marrakech several years ago. Our stay in that ancient city was greatly enhanced thanks to one Khalid Amor, a National Official Tour Guide (\u201cAccompagnateur National de Tourisme\u201d) who was lined up for us at our hotel, Riad Utopia Spa and Suites. Mr. Amor accompanied my wife and me on a several-hour walk through the nooks and crannies of the old walled city (or medina) and was a fountain of information and insight along the way. We saw close-up more of the old city than we possibly could have on our own. He graciously answered our many questions, including any we had about cultural issues that concerned us. In short, he helped us feel comfortable in this totally unfamiliar cultural and religious environment. In the end, we were just visitors exploring this UNESCO World Heritage Site happily finding that common courtesy along with the kind of respect a guest shows while visiting someone\u2019s home goes a long way towards helping you \u201cfit in.\u201d Mr. Amor never made us feel rushed either. On a more practical level, he quickly alerted us to the fact that bicyclists and motorcyclists frequently shoot though the narrow alleyways where all the foot traffic goes as well, so keep your eyes peeled and be ready to step aside in a flash! Our guide escorted us through a vast labyrinthine, semi-covered, small-market district apparently grouped by trade, such as meat-processing and leather-working (closely linked!), metal-working, wood-working, textiles, and produce. He familiarized us with some of the buildings associated with daily Islamic religious practices and rituals. We were fortunate to visit the Ben Youssef Madrasa, a former Islamic religious college, now a museum. There we saw the intricate beauty of Islamic art found in all the tile-work and wood tracery. We saw examples of cells where students would have resided and the more spacious rooms where visiting scholars would have lodged. Mr. Amor took us to a communal bakery and explained (and we actually saw) how folks come in throughout the day to leave their unbaked bread with the baker who baked the loaves in his ancient brick oven and had them ready for pick-up in a few hours time. The smell of finished loaves was divine! We stopped in a few \u201chigher-end\u201d shops, such as a carpet dealer, an herbal pharmacy, and an artisan lamp shop\u2014intricately worked metal lamps are a specialty in Morocco. We were tourists after all. As the afternoon merged into early evening, our guide got us back to our hotel after having spent a very long time with just the two of us. We were most grateful to him for his generous, patient, and kind spirit. His English, by the way, was excellent. He showed us and taught us more about his city than we could have possibly managed on our own. He helped bridge the gap for us and made us feel more at home than we otherwise would have. Thank you, Khalid Amor, and thanks to Riad Utopia for setting us up with him."

For the past 13 years our family has been taking summer vacations around the World and in planning this trips I was use TripAdvisor to find great guides, tours, things to do and everything else.

Khalid was very responsive in replying to my emails and I quickly realized he was the real deal. Khalid picked us up from the airport and was there right when we arrived. He's such a happy and loving guy I immediately thought how lucky I am to have him as our guide for 2 days.

Like so many others have written here in reviews Khalid is indeed passionate about his job and taught us so much about the history and traditions of Marrakech. He's like having your favorite college professor showing you around with a depth of knowledge only a professor would have. Our kids really loved Khalid and enjoyed learning from him. And, like many others who've written reviews Khalid recommend great places to eat, people watch and shop and also what to look out for.

Luckily, despite the fact it was only a week before we arrived, he had some dates still available and promptly replied with a wealth of information, whereupon we quickly booked him up for a half day walking tour of the city. As scheduled, he met us at our Riad - along with a kind gift of some marmalade and Argon oil.As we\u2019d already explored a few of the more well-known sights on our own the day before, Khalid was happy to tailor the itinerary - taking us for an engrossing trip through the winding Marrakech streets to markets and souks, showing us leather, shoe and iron craftsmen at work, along with the local baker and hammam furnace man - many of which we\u2019d never have discovered on our own - as well as to more well known sights such as El Bahia Palace and El Fna square. He gave great insight into all the places we saw, whilst allowing us plenty of time for photos - regaling us with interesting historical facts as well as tips on places we might enjoy during the rest of our trip.All the locals seem to know him and greet him with a smile, and i\u2019m sure his company gained us entry to places we wouldn\u2019t normally have seen. The only thing to perhaps consider when booking is going for the morning or all day tour. We booked an afternoon tour, and as it was also Ramadan a few of the more well known sights were closing shortly after, or in the case of Ben Youssef Madrasa, as we arrived - though Khalid actually managed to get us inside for a look around even after the doors had been closed to everyone else!

Luckily for us, the company we had originally booked our transfers and excursions with had let us down and we then found Khalid with less than 2 weeks until we flew. We had been reading up on Marrakech and it all sounded very intimidating, so decided to book a guide for a full day - one of the best decisions we made. Khalid met us at our hotel on our first morning at 10.00, kindly bringing gifts with him. He is a lovely guy, his enthusiasm for his religion and country are contagious. We learnt so much from him and saw parts of Marrakech that we would not had seen had we been alone. Amongst places visited was Medrassa Ben Youssef, Koutoubia Mosque, Bahia Palace, Jemaa El Fna Square and of course the souks.My husband loves his photography so the places Khalid took us were perfect (I have no interest in shopping!). The Bahia Palace looks nothing from outside....then when you walk in \u2013 wow! Khalid was so patient whilst my husband took photographs. It was fascinating to get a true insight into Marrakech and the lives of the locals. The visit to the baker was so interesting, and what a lovely happy man he is, happily posing for a photograph.When we were hungry Khalid took us to a restaurant where we had our first Moroccan meal. My husband has the lamb with prunes and I had a couscous dish which we both thoroughly enjoyed....then it was back to the tour. We walked so many steps that day (my \u201cfit bit\u201d was certainly on overtime, with over 20,000 steps!). Khalid was extremely thoughtful \u2013 checking that we had enough water in the 40 degree heat, whilst he was unable to drink due to it being Ramadan \u2013 don\u2019t know how these guys do it.We told Khalid that we now had the confidence to come back into Marrakech unaccompanied so at the end of the tour he wrote down recommended restaurants, which food stalls were good in the square (they each have a number), which restaurants had good terraces so you could \u201cpeople watch\u201d without being hassled and recommended books on Morocco.Am so happy we found this lovely man when searching for a guide \u2013 don\u2019t hesitate in booking him for your tour, you will not regret it."

Prior to our trip to Marrakech, my friends and I wanted to book a tour guide to show and educate us on Moroccocan culture and people, especially within the old city. On the basis of the rave reviews, we decided to hire Mr Khalid for a full day Tour. I contacted him 2 weeks before our intended trip and he responded to my email within 24 hours to schedule a tour. As agreed, Mr Khalid met us promptly at our hotel and led us on a full walking tour of the city, introducing us to the old city, the Medina and its hidden treasures, along with some historical sites. Some of the sites included the Medrassa ben Youssef, the man maintaining the hammam furnace, the communal bakery man, Djemaa El Fna square and of course the Souks! Almost everyone knew him in the souks, a local celebrity indeed. We learned so much and shown things which we would have surely missed if we chose to tour Marrakech by ourselves.He is such a humble, kind, friendly, highly knowledgeable man. His English is very good. Throughout the tour he was very patient and flexible with us, making sure we were able to take plenty of photographs and willing to adjust the pace of the tour to meet our other needs.Surely one of my best and memorable day. To top it off, he left some local orange marmalade and olive oil at our hotel reception. I wouldn't hesitate to hire him again when next in Marrakech."

A little background, I'm a 21 year old female traveler for you curious people out there. I contacted my tour guide Khalid and he responded to my email in just a few hours. He's extremely quick on his replies and very easy to schedule with. As for the actual tour, he is SO knowledgable about everything in Marrakech. He was born and raised here so he has endless connections and stories to share. He knew so many people around the Medina and Souks I was in shock. His friendliness is so contagious and you can tell the other locals here really enjoy him. I felt extremely safe the entire trip and was totally comfortable walking around with him the entire afternoon. He showed me very unique spots in the city that I don't think any other tour guide would have shown. Throughout the tour he made sure I had the best photo opportunities and was very patient with me. I feel like I have a really strong understanding of the culture here and feel confident while walking the streets and souks because of his amazing welcoming tour. After the tour he offered me a list of places to eat throughout my stay here to make sure I get the best quality and deals. He also gave me tips when buying products and other thriving skills for this bustling city. If I ever need help he offered his number for my disposal. I would recommend him to EVERYONE I know and am positive I will come back to Morocco and this city because of his amazing hospitality. This was worth every single penny. Not only was he a great tour guide but I would also consider him a friend."

He didn't mind to wait for the three of us who like to stop to take pictures, and also very knowledgeable when answering all of our questions about Marrakech and its culture. We loved the tour so much, we decided to book another tour with him to Essaouira, and again Khalid showed us how he knew the place like the back of his hand. All the places we visit was very unique, he even bought us very delicious pastries from the local bread shop - a hidden gem.

We initially came with the Intrepid travel group but had some extra few days on our own before our tour with Intrepid started so I booked a day with Khalid. I completely regret traveling with Intrepid. If I had known of Khalid before booking with Intrepid, I would have just booked solely with Khalid. He is by far the best tour guide. I can't emphasize that enough. We had our fair share of tour guides with Intrepid and none compared to Khalid. While Intrepid was just fine, our guides were nice and informative, Khalid is exceptional. He has a wealth of knowledge, is very intelligent and has a great personality. We loved walking around the souks with him and highly recommend him. I've already given his number to a few of our Intrepid travel companions who want a less commercial tour. Don't be tempted by the cheaper tours from western companies like Intrepid and Peregrine. Khalid is worth every penny and you will have a far better experience booking with Khalid than any other company, large or small."

I booked Khalid for a day tour of Marrakech medina, based on the reviews I had seen on tripadvisor and I can honestly say he is one of the best guides I have ever had. Everything was well organised and he was very knowledgable about the city. He also took me to more out of the way parts of the Medina and gave me a sense of what life is like there (and ensured I could wonder round without fear of getting lost in the maze of narrow streets!). Khalid is also an exceptionally nice person and very good company, and I would not hesitate to use him again or to recommend him to others visiting Marrakech."

If you are looking for a great city tour with someone who has a passion for what he does,a love of his people,culture and city then definitely book a tour with Khalid! Right from the start he met us where our Hotel shuttle dropped us off and took us through the Souks and city giving us the rich history of the local craftsman and artisans.He will help you with haggling process if you are on the hunt for some local goods and take you to the best spots to buy. He makes you feel instantly secure and treats you as a friend.He speaks a variety of languages which is a plus for any guide and has a variety of tours to offer which I am sure would be just as amazing as the full day city.The restaurant he recommended for lunch was fantastic.And though it was a 6.5 hr tour he does not rush through it he will accommodate and adjust it to work with you as well as him- which again just shows how much he loves what he does. Please if you are planning a trip to Marrakesh contact Khalid-the tour will be a highlight to your trip.We can not say enough positive things about our experience with him!!! Thank You Again Khalid !!!"

His depth of knowledge was evident and he gave us great insight into the culture and history of Marrakech and the Medina. He was extremely courteous and kind at all times.

We cannot thank Khalid enough for making our trip memorable and one of the best we've ever taken. Travel is our passion. We've had a lot of great private tours and guides all over the world, but Khalid is in a class of his own. His knowledge and love of his country and culture shines through. Khalid has a Ph.D. in French literature, and has a wealth of cultural information that he is happy to share with his guests. If you hire Khalid, you will get to experience a genuine and soul-touching reality of Morocco. Not the touristy, overpriced shops but the souks and the neighborhoods where everyone knows Khalid, with sites and sounds of the people going to the market to buy freshly-baked bread or rushing to the mosque led by the calls the prayer that permeate the air. After a very thorough one day tour of Marrakech, we did a few day trips: the Atlas Mountains, Ourzazate, Essaouira, and a private transfer to Casablanca. The schedule was packed with sites to see, people to meet and amazing food to enjoy. The cars used are new and luxurious (Toyota Landcruiser and Mercedes minivans) and our drivers were outstanding - professional and very safety oriented. Despite the winding roads in the Atlas Mountains, we always felt safe. Khalid is a passionate guide, and a great guy. His hospitality was remarkable, and we felt like we were touring the country with an old friend, not a person we just met. He went out of his way to indulge all our whims, from taking way too many pictures of us to finding specific Moroccan cookbooks that my wife was interested in. Not a day went by without him bringing us some thoughtful gift, from fresh pastries, dates, figs, olives and orange jam to small souvenirs.  We'll never forget this trip and can\u2019t wait to go back. Thank you, Khalid, for making us fall in love with Morocco and its people."

He was very polite and professional throughout; from the first reply email to the final gift he delivered (olive oil & marmalade) to our riad near Medina.If you are new to the area do book a guided tour to open your eyes to hidden sights - and doors to secret local history and customs. As al tourist just walking the streets you will miss out on lots. We also understood better the importance of Moroccan family and community ties after the tour. Khalid is highly educated and a real fountain of interesting facts (this made us realise how big are our gaps of knowledge of North African colourful history). We will do some reading on Morocco next, he gave us book recommendations as well. Khalid also showed genuine interest in our questions and recommended eating places frequented by locals, and also a posher place for our Christmas dinner (Dar Moha). We would love to return to Morocco and visit Ourika Valley / High Atlas - Khalid would be the perfect guide! Thank you again."

He took us to places that we would never have found on our own and helped us gain a good lay-of-the-land to use as a foundation for our time in Marrakech. Along the way he would point out restaurants we should try and other places we might want to visit (he even wrote them out in a list for us at the end of the tour). During the tour we visited the Palais de Bahia, Koutoubia Mosque, Complexe Ben Youssef, and Complexe Moussine (baths). We walked around streets off the beaten path and visited souks. The best part of the tour was seeing the \"back\" side of the souks where the artisans were actually making shoes from leather in front of your eyes and hand-punching holes into lanterns in intricate patterns. It was truly amazing to see the craftsmanship firsthand. Khalid knew all the shop owners, so we didn't feel like intruders walking through their turf. Keep in mind, the temperature was 104 F (40 C) and this was a walking tour. Our visit was smack-dab in the middle of Ramadan meaning that Khalid could not eat or drink from sun up to sun down. Yet, despite any discomfort he may have been feeling, he didn't let it show to us and remained 100% professional and friendly the entire tour. We had a great time and were glad that we picked Khalid and Best Tours for our tour around Marrakech."

Starting off our time here with a guided tour gave us the confidence we needed to keep exploring on our own.Khalid was great, he was super knowledgable and answered every question we had. He gave us a great introduction to the country, the city, the history, culture, and religion. He took us around the Medina, visiting a palace, the Mosque, the craft area, and finally the Souks. We really felt like we got an insider's view of the city, as he took us to see how they heat the Hamams, back into some of the communal artisan areas, and to see some of the craftsmen at work (metal & leather). At every stop he had a great story and a ton of knowledge to give us on the history or significance of the place. It was Ramadan so we had extra questions about Islam and he was eager and happy to share. We were interested in seeing the evening prayers and he suggested dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Mosque. It was probably one of the more movings things I have seen and his suggestion for the restaurant, and what time to go, was absolutely perfect. He gave us a few other tips too and every one of them helped to make our visit exceed our expectations. Finally, he really helped us understand how to best to navigate through Marrakech. How to deal with aggressive salesmen and self-appointed 'guides' that you will encounter on your stay, the Snake charmers and pictures with monkeys. I would recommend him for anyone who is coming to visit!"

It was absolutely excellent, enriching, and gives a perspective on the souk and the history of the city beyond what meets the eye.First, Khalid is extremely knowledgeable, not only about the city but history as a whole providing perspective to how Marrakech became such an important trade center. Second, he takes you via little alleys, the public bakery, the public hammam, the blacksmith area, showing you the people behind the crafts. Its a complete different perspective. Third, and something so important, he did not take us to stores --on the contrary-- he ensured that people in the souk respected our space as we learned about Marrakech. However, if you felt intrigued about some craft or product, he ll definitely accommodate some of these small detours. For instance, I wanted to try the almond seed from which argan oil is made. We went to one of the herbal stores where they very kindly let us try it (no need to bargain, no need to feel obligated to give money). Since we were so intrigued about the olives and oranges in the area, he left the next day in the hotel a gift with an olive oil from his grove and an orange marmalade. I recommend 100% taking a tour with Khalid."

But also led us to hidden places we would scarce have had the opportunity to find on our own, giving us the opportunity to meet some hardworking people with inspiring skills or stories. He has a lovely demeanor, was great with our son as well as any question we might have had about history, politics and everyday life. He went above and beyond what we expected of a \"tour guide\".

We stumbled upon Khalid by accident having booked Abdul for a day tour of the Medina.Abdul was double booked so his friend Khalid stepped in at the last minute. It could not have turned out any better. Khalid is a very genuine, humble, knowledgeable and humorous person. We obtained a wonderful insight into the city. As well as taking us to some sites of historical and religious significance the unexpected pleasure was the introduction to craftsmen working in wood and metal with the friendliness that all these people conveyed to us. Khalid is really a catalyst who makes you feel part of the real culture of the city rather than a confused tourist wandering around aimlessly! We even visited the man who stokes the furnace of the hammam next door and at the same time cooks the Tanjia for anyone who pays a small fee to collect later in the day. A fascinating insight into the everyday life of the ordinary Marrakshi. Khalid spoke excellent English, was extremely knowledgeable about the history of his city and of Islamic art, but most of all a genuinely friendly man who you would look forward to meeting again. My wife slipped on water in the Medina and sprained her wrist so the tour was immediately adjusted to take in an apothecary [traditional pharmacy] where she was given a massage with soothing essential oils! What a memorable day it turned out to be. Please do not hesitate to book Khalid, you will not regret it."

He had the most charming and friendly face, fluent in English, friendly and enthusiastic whilst being very professional. He has an immense knowledge of Marrakesh and its history. I guess all these one would expect form a good guide. What really impressed us was his ability to read his clients and their likes and dislikes and arranging to whole day around them and their needs and wishes. To cap this he really could not do enough. He went as far as booking us our transport (large and comfortable Mercedes) to and from the Atlas Mountains (I hasten to add at a fraction of cost of what hotels were charging). During our transfer to and from the Atlas Mountains he called to make sure all was well. What more can one ask? I cannot recommend Khalid highly enough and will certainly use his services again and again."

We particularly loved having a cup of Moroccan mint tea and traditional square crepe with him in a local place just in front of the hammam, while looking at people coming in and out of the traditional bath, and listening to stories about Moroccan customs.

Therefore I started to search the internet / forums for a guide who offer a trip to the desert. I had contact with a lot of guides and I decided to made the trip with Adil (reasons: friendly, good english, made suggestions, reacts quickly). We booked the 3-day-private-tour with Adil from Marrakech to the Sahara and it was the best we ever made. Despite the warning of our government (e.g. kidnapping) we never felt uncomfortable / unwell anywhere. (Before we started the trip we met him three days before, because my gilrdfriend felt a little bit unsafe and thereafter everything was fine : - ) )Adil organized the tour perfectly, taking care of small special request, and is an absolutely safe driver and speaks perfect English. Please note that the trip to the desert take more than 6 hours, so if you read something about a trip to the desert/sahare less than 6 hours - it\u00b4s not true! Our higlight of the trip was the night in a Berber tent and the delicious dinner in the open air with a single table on a dune (perfect time for the propose : - ) ). Necessarily spend the time in the berber tent even if you can choose the option of a standard hotel but don\u00b4t expect too much luxury. Everything is clean and simple... People there are always orderly, honestly and friendly. Adil is very careful with whom he collaborates. Last but not least, the sunset in the desert, the stars as well as the incredible silence - it was just wonderful.We would recommend this tour to 100 percent especially because of the nature and sympthatic person Adil and his willingness to help poor childrens (he lways carried eg. crayons as well as warm clothings for childrens with him) and his professionalism.@ Adil: Thank you for your friendship and that you showed us your country. Hopefully we\u00b4ll meet again. in sch\u0101'a ll\u0101h : - )"

What a brilliant choice it was to firstly choose Khalid to guide us around Marrakech, but also to actually book a guided tour. Every aspect of this tour was enthralling and really fantastic: we learnt so much and saw aspects of the city that had totally passed us by on our first visit! As our tour guide, Khalid was very charming, patient and so kind, really taking time to find out what we were interested in for maximum enjoyment. By the end of our half day with him he felt like an old friend. His English is perfect. He was very informative about all aspects of Marrakech - it's history, it's culture, spirit and, more importantly for us on our tour - it's cuisine! We particularly enjoyed visiting the local hamman fire, seeing where the tanginas were cooked in the fire, and also seeing the local bakery and visiting food stalls. Khalid was so helpful with tips about where to eat in the street markets and what foods to try - it gave us more confidence to explore in the days ahead too. We are keen to try other tours when we return to Marrakesh and Khalid is definitely our man! He comes highly recommended and this city tour was nothing short of 'excellent'.

I am not usually a fan of organized tours, but my friends and I were really hoping to do a desert excursion. By the time we were finished, we wished we had booked much much longer with Marvelous Morocco. Iddir was incredible - everything was planned perfectly. Rachid, who we spent the majority of the time with, was such an angel. He did absolutely everything to make us comfortable and happy - plus he was so much fun. We saw so many things and made so many stops that we would have never found on our own. This was truly the highlight of our entire two week Morocco-Spain vacation. So much love to you Rachid & Iddir, thanks for everything!!! Hope to see you again soon."

We wanted to modify the trips that were posted, and Iddir made that very easy to do. Radoin, our driver and guide, was superb .... exceptionally knowledgeable, a very careful driver, and a lot of fun to be with. We spent an extra day in Erg Chebbi and had a fantastic time touring the desert with Radoin, visiting sights he knew well from living in the area. We clearly did things and went places other travelers did not do, which made the time extra special. I cannot say enough good things about the experience."

I organized the trip with Iddir via email. He responded to all questions within a reasonable amount of time and even customized the trip to our schedules (flying in and out at several different times). We were met at the airport by Rachid who was our guide for the majority of the trip. He was absolutely fantastic. Rachid was very sensitive and accommodating to the fact that we were a group of 4 females traveling alone. The food and Riads were all fantastic. I have no complaints and am planning on setting up another trip with this amazing company! Inschallah! If you are planning on going to Morocco, you will not be disappointed in utilizing Marvelous Morocco Tours! Reasonable prices and they treat you like a family member! Thank you Iddir, Rachid and Abdul!"

Our 1st two days were spent driving with a wonderful and very safe driver that Iddir provided. Iddir picked us up at our villa in Marrakech and took us up and through the Atlas mountains, Roses Valley, Dades valley with an overnight in Chez Pierre Hotel. Then onto the Todra Gorges, Erfoud, and Merzouga Camel trekking with a night in a Berber tent. The third day we continued our trip to Fez and spent two nights in the lovely riad Yacout Fes. The following day we went Chafchaouen spending two nights there. Iddir took us to Casablanca where we spent the night and caught our flight home in the morning. Not only did he take us to Casablanca but he picked us up at 3 am to make our flight back to the US. We were all thrilled with our trip and especially the dedication and care that Iddir provided. He was always there to make sure we were taken care of and went out of his way to make us happy! Iddir is also an excellent guide and so well informed about the history and culture of Morocco. If you are traveling to Morocco be sure to use Marvelous Moroccan Tours and ask for Iddir."

Ali arrived at our Riad on time on the first day and took exceptional care of us throughout our 4 days with him. He made sure we had plenty of photo stops (and refreshment breaks!) along the journey. We absolutely loved the night in the desert and the camel trekking. A night under the shooting stars is definitely an unforgettable experience. We also had the pleasure of meeting Iddir along our trip who was great fun too. The only recommendation I would make is to have a bit more of a structured information pack ahead of the trip. I had lots of questions ahead of the trip, as I'd never done anything like this before, which Iddir answered promptly but felt like more information at the start would have been helpful. Would definitely recommend this to anyone though! As two young females, they made us feel very safe and comfortable."

We spent 10 days in Morocco and doing the 4-day desert trip with Iddir from Marvellous Morocco tours was definitely the main highlight. From the very start, Iddir provided the highest level of professionalism, collecting us from our Riad, taking all of our bags, always making sure that we were happy and that we had a brilliant experience overall. I was overwhelmed with the attention to detail in the accommodation Iddir arranged for us. All of the guesthouses and hotels were beautiful and surpassed both of our expectations. Iddir and the staff in each hotel could not do enough to help us and cater to our needs regarding food, comfort and entertainment. More than that, Iddir treated us like old friends of his, telling us anecdotes and personal stories from his childhood about the different sights we saw throughout the mountains and desert. He made the journey very special and memorable, even bringing us to his sister's home where we were welcomed with traditional Moroccan mint tea and delicacies in preparation for a family wedding. The night we spent in the desert was amazing. Iddir arranged everything down to the last detail: we rode camels at sunset with a small intimate group of other travellers, stayed in a nomadic camp and had dinner brought out to us under the desert stars. Iddir and his friends played the Berber drums and sang while getting us involved with the dancing and music. Everything about this trip was special: Iddir was helpful, organised, friendly, approachable, enthusiastic, thoughtful and highly professional. He was as important as the breathtaking locations themselves; a tour guide and a tour company I would recommend to friends and family without hesitation. Lastly, the trip was very reasonable and was much better value for money than most other tour companies we researched. A winner!"

Everyone was raving about it so I stopped looking and decided to contact them. Iddir was very prompt and professional in his correspondence. He sent itineraries and answered all my questions. I had very high expectations because of the great reviews and I was not disappointed!We were in Morocco for 7 days but the highlight of our trip was the 3 days we spent with Iddir. We are a family of 4, my husband and I and our 2 daughters. Iddir treated us like family. We felt safe and secure unlike our other experience while in Morocco where some tour guides mainly took us to shops where we're cornered to buy things instead of see the sights. Our tour was the 3 day Marrakesh to Fez Desert Tour and it was amazing!!! Sleeping underneath the stars in the middle of the Sahara desert is a once in a lifetime experience and should be on anyone's bucket list! I highly highly recommend doing this trip with Iddir as I can guarantee you that he will look after you well. What I like about Marvelous Morocco Tours is that it's a family business and you get to meet Iddir's family along the way. We stopped by his sister's house in Rissani where we got a glimpse of the local way of life. It was amazing hospitality as she welcomed us into her home and had couscous and mint tea with her family. You can't get a more authentic Moroccan experience than that! We also met Iddir's brother, Hassani, who took care of us while in Merzouga, at the Sahara desert. He was so sweet and looked after us well. At the end of the tour it really felt like we're leaving family behind, our Berber family.Given the chance I would definitely book with Marvelous Morocco Tours again, as I'm definitely coming back!"

We got to see to see so much more of Morocco than I anticipated, and all of it was so beautiful. Even though some of the car rides were long, the scenery was so gorgeous, you don't even mind. Every meal that you are given is AMAZING!!! Especially the night that you are out in the desert. It is seriously like you are staying in a five star hotel, desert style. Incredible. The night in the desert was let alone worth the money. I've never enjoyed something so much in my life. We rode camels into the sunset (which was absolutely spectacular), then played bongo drums, ate amazing food, and looked at the amazing stars in the desert. It was absolutely incredible. I would definitely recommend this tour group to anybody looking to see Morocco and have some fun. Iddir was amazing, and made the experience that much more awesome! He was was funny, informational, and made the trip one to remember!! I'll definitely be back at some point in my life!

Along the way we took in some of the major ad minor sights for many photo opportunities. Some off road beautiful spots and really select people to visit on our trip to the desert and back. We got to go to meet some of the local nomadic peolple for a little bit and get a taste of real Morrocan life.Iddir is a real local and brings a lot of his knowledge to the trip. It feels like being brought around by a distant cousin or relative. He spoke great english ( as well as many other languages) and answered any questions we had. He brough us to a lot of little off the road spots that you wouldnt get the chance to see otherwise as well as joining in on the fun. When we booked the tour, we were expecting to be sleeping in hostels or self-cooking accommodation but instead, Iddir booked us into great hotels. All weith mod cons, excellent service, food and music. We felt very welcomed and looked after in each place we stayed. Then in the evening he would check in to make sure we had everything we needed as well as teaching me how to read the stars in the desert. That he himself had learned from his grandfather. He is an excellent tour guide. He looked after us very well. We felt very well cared for and brought around. What makes me write such a positive review is that he made us feel very welcome as friends rather than just a tourist visiting. I strongly recommend him for any family visiting."

Not only did we have an amazing time touring the Dades Valley, the Sahara Desert, the High-Atlas and Mid-Atlas Mountains, but we also learned a tremendous amount about the history of the country, the people, and made some new friends along the way. The goal of the trip for me was to wake up in the Sahara Desert on my birthday and what I got was so much more. In planning this part of the trip, we read so many great reviews for Marvelous-Morocco Tours and about Iddir specifically as a guide. Iddir was extremely responsive from the very first email, and in expressing our wishes for the trip \u2013 he came through and tailored everything. He was fun and easy going, and the hotels he arranged were like something out of a dream! Some of the highlights of the tour included camping in the Sahara desert and traveling out on camels.

It's very important to note this tour was private and Iddir shaped it to fit our desires. We are retired and at the age of 76, with joint replacements, heart stents and a knee that doesn't always want to work, we knew we would not be able to keep up in a group. So it was the 2 of us in an very comfortable 4x4, and Iddir was our driver & guide. We asked for medium priced accommodation & were pleasantly surprised how delux the small hotels were. Breakfast and dinner were included and delicious. We could even order wine, which we found difficult in Tangier. We did an overnight camel ride into the desert which was magical. The day was 107F so Iddir made sure we were properly clothed and onto our camels in the early evening. He then showed up at dinner to make sure all was well.Our \"tent\" had a huge bed, flush toilet, sink & shower. We were lucky and able to have a private campsite, dinner, music & stargazing with story telling with Hassan our camel whisperer. We highly recommend this company for senior citizens or any age who are looking for a trip with a guide who will go out of their way to make sure you are having an enjoyable trip.Iddir owns the company and personally makes sure his guides (I think their are 5 total) fit the needs, language and interests of each client."

Our journey continued with more sightseeing and a night at an amazing quaint hotel called Chez Pierre tucked in the mountains of Dades Gorge and the restaurant dining was spectacular! The following day we headed to the Merzouga. On the way to the desert we stopped by to visit a local market, picked up some local pizza and were welcomed into his sisters families home to have our lunch. What a wonderful family! We left with very full stomachs! We continued on our drive and to our next destination where we rode camels into the Sahara desert and sat on the sand to watch the sunset. Our stay in the desert was an unforgettable experience with a night of great food, live music and star gazing. The next day we headed off to our final destination into Fez and we did a bit more sightseeing along the way. I highly recommend this tour and especially with Iddir!

During the four days we experienced the authentic side of Moroccan life; local markets, BBQ, \"Berber pizza\". Some of my favourite memories were of the spectacular scenery that we saw eg Atlas Mountains, the deserts, numerous valleys or going off road in his 4x4 and seeing different oases and Kasbahs. On the first day we did an excellent tour of Kasbah de bin haddou and would highly recommend it.The camel excursion and camping in the Sahara desert is one of those bucket list adventures.

We were given a wealth of information in a spice shop, and were able to see the market from a local perspective - something that is still very memorable! We also had the chance to visit a local nomad store, where we were shown various authentic local craftsmanship, including beautiful rugs.All of the accommodation exceeded our expectations - absolutely beautiful! We never felt unsafe when we were with Iddir. We did not want to take the cinema tour in Ouarzazate, so he was even was able to take us (with our request) again to Ait Ben Haddou, where a guide led us on a hike through nearby meadows and rivers, giving us a view of the city many other tourists don't get.On the way home, we were suggested to a different restaurant than the usual place. This place was so off the beaten path that we had to have our order placed for us. There, we had some of the best tagine in all of Morocco, and a beautiful view, too! Would highly recommend this tour!"

Having spent nearly a month total in Morocco on 3 separate occasions this past year (and still planning to go back for more!), I can honestly say that the days I spent with Iddir and MMT each time were by far my favorite and most memorable. Of course he only has 5 star reviews. He is not capable of providing anything less. He will go far beyond what is necessary to ensure you not only have a marvelous and meticulously planned holiday, but also an authentic experience you remember your entire life. Morocco is a beautiful country with amazing people but, to a first timer especially, it can be quite intimidating and difficult to navigate if you do not speak the languages and do not have a car. Plan a trip with Iddir and you will not have to worry about these things and can just focus on having an amazing time with your friends and family and enjoy all the splendor Morocco has to offer!"

Iddir was extremely professional, accommodating and flexible in planning our trip. It took my friend and I a while to figure out what exactly we wanted to do during the trip, but Iddir made it easy for us. We travelled 4 days and three nights with Mohammed from Fes to Marrakesh through the desert and all those incredible places. We got to see a lot, ask thousands of questions about the culture and life in Morocco and eat great fresh food. Mohammed made the trip very special for us and we even asked him to spend one more extra day to take us to Essaouira on our last day in Morocco. I expected a lot from this trip, but got so much more thanks to Mohammed and Iddir.You guys ROCK!"

I was skeptical of all the five star reviews on here and reading through the reviews there was a common theme - Iddir. Iddir runs marvelous Morocco tours and was also our guide for the 3day/2night trip from Marrakesh to Fes. He is knowledgable, personable, funny, and a joy to be around. You can tell Iddir has developed close relationships with the community as they all seem to know him and greet him warmly. What sets this tour apart from the rest is that it is an independent operator and they truly want you to have an authentic experience. We spoke with other travelers where their tour guides ended up taking them to visit an uncles shop or a workshop trying to sell souvenirs. Not once did Iddir take us anywhere commercial. Instead we visited a local market in Rissani to see how the villagers traded livestock, we visited caves where the nomads lived and would have had tea with if they hadn't moved on just a few days before, we pulled over to the side of a road to view fossils, we even had lunch with Iddir's sister and her family. Our time with Iddir was one of the highlights of this trip. He definitely deserves all those 5 star reviews. Shukraan Iddir! From Coffee and Tea!"

We had the pleasure of spending 5 days with our guide and owner of the company, Iddir, on a trip through the Atlas Mountains and Sahara desert from Marrakech to Fes. We stayed in 4 different places along the way and each and every hotel was perfect and more than anything we had expected. Iddir took care of everything; from picking us up at our Raid in Marrakech, keeping the days on schedule, planning for meals, relaxation, photo points, handling luggage, and to sharing a wealth of information on the places we were visiting and the cultures in Morocco. We especially loved the 2 days we got to spend in Merzouga and the Erg Chebbi Dunes. The camel trek was a blast and the accommodations both in the dunes and in Merzouga were fantastic! Spending the day with Iddir cruising around Merzouga was a highlight of our tour, as it is his hometown and readily shared what he loved about the desert with us. I could go on and on about how much fun we had and about the details of our trip, but to sum it up - it was a trip of a lifetime, book a trip with Marvelous Morocco Tours - and you won\u2019t regret it. Of our 3 weeks in Morocco, these 5 days were most definitely THE HIGHLIGHT of our trip. From the knowledge we gained, the stories we all shared, the good music while road tripping, and our new found friend and desert brother, Iddir, we felt absolutely lucky to have booked this trip and we are sure it won\u2019t be our last!"

Our driver Ibrahim really made use of the 4x4 jeep and showed us spots we wouldn\u00b4t have seen on our own. We chose the cheaper price option that included middle-range hotels and all the hotels exceeded our expectations (pretty, clean, pool, etc.). Our personal highlight was the night in the sahara. There was a bonfire, berber music, shisha smoking and a beautiful night sky with countless starts. Iddir was not our guide but we met him along the way and he is a very nice, funny and relaxed guy. One day we were invited for lunch at his sisters house, she made couscous and berber pizza for us - another highlight for us!We loved Morocco and we will be back for another trip!"

I honestly cannot put into words how surreal this trip was. My girlfriends (5 in total) travelled with Iddir, our guide, on a 4 day trip through the Sahara (Marrakech to Fes). We travelled around in a beautiful Jeep which accomodated all five of us well. Although, I was a bit reluctant to travel to Morocco with a group of young girls, I cannot stress enough how safe and protected we felt throughout the entirety of the trip. Iddir, our guide, was one of the most welcoming, knowledgeable and fun tour guides I have ever experienced. He always made sure we were well looked after and experienced authentic Morocco. If you are thinking of doing a big trip... I would strongly recommend that you look into Marvelous Morocco Tours which is much more personal. Iddir and his colleagues will no doubt be able to show you a much more authentic, wholesome and inspiring Morocco. Iddir picked us up from our hostel in Marrakech and had everything carried through the busy streets to his Jeep which sat outside of the Medina. This is where we started our amazing trip. Some of the trips highlights included:- Atlas Mountain tours (snowball fights included)-Jeep rides through the Sahara (sitting on the outside of the jeep)-Ksar of Ait-Ben Haddou Day Trip-Gorges of Dades Day Trip-Authentic lunch with Iddir's family (The most amazing and welcoming family you could ever imagine)-Merzouga camel trek/camping overnight (bonfire under the stars)-Sandboarding in the Sahara -Constant food stops in the most authentic Moroccan areas-Beautiful, clean and unique hotels I don't even think this review does this trip enough justice. This will be a trip I remember for the rest of my life. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need further information."

I don't think we could have picked a kinder more helpful tourguide! Iddir went above and beyond multiple times to ensure we felt comfortable and at home during the entire tour. Unfortunately, our luggage was lost on the airplane on our way over to Morocco, Iddir took it upon himself to call the airport relentlessly for four days until we got our luggage back! During those four days he still provided us with incredible tours while he would continuously work at getting our luggage back. During some of the long car ride Iddir would entertain us with clever riddles and funny jokes, which made the time pass quickly! He would also pull off on the side of the road to show us a magic trick or even just to have a snowball fight in the mountains. He took us to see many amazing sites and also booked us to stay in some pretty awesome hotels. There is not one bad thing to say about this guy! When we were booking our trip we were a little surprised and skeptical to see that he only had perfect reviews on here, but after touring with him, I can say without a doubt he deserves every one of them! I would highly recommend anyone to go on a tour with him or his company!"

Not to mention then night sky which to our delight they called \"Berber tv\"!

Iddir was an awesome guide: enthusiastic, funny, knowledgeable, and fluent in multiple languages (including English, French, Spanish, Berber, and Arabic). He took care of everything during our trip, including finding places to stay, making reservations at restaurants, securing transportation between different points, showing us around each stop on our itinerary, and hiring local guides as needed (e.g. for Fes and the Sahara). I don't normally book guides when traveling, but this was such a great experience that I wouldn't consider visiting Morocco without Iddir.OUR TRIP* 9 people* We visited Marrakech, Ait Benhaddou, Ouarzazate, Dades Valley, Merzouga/Sahara, Fes, and Essaouira over the course of a week.SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS* We booked our first night's riad (in Marrakech) without Iddir's guidance and had a relatively negative experience (no hot water in the showers, rude service, no breakfast). * By comparison, the riads that Iddir reserved for us were excellent (very good service, fantastic rooms, phenomenal food). * We found that many riads in Morocco have unanimous 5-star reviews on TripAdvisor whether they're good or not, so having Iddir's help finding the best places to stay was essential. The places that Iddir booked for us were also generally cheaper than the first riad we booked on our own, so we didn't pay a premium for the peace of mind.GETTING AROUND MOROCCO* Because of our group's size, Iddir secured a large van and a driver for our trip. The van was spacious and comfortable, and we didn't have any problems getting around easily.* There are random police checkpoints throughout Morocco, so having a guide who speaks Berber/Arabic and has the proper paperwork is a must. These checkpoints were not a problem at all with Iddir, but if our group had tried to rent a car and drive around Morocco ourselves, it would have been very stressful and maybe impossible.* Iddir was mindful of regularly stopping for bathroom breaks, making sure we had enough water, and ensuring we stopped at photogenic spots so we could take lots of photos :)* Along the way, Iddir also taught us about Morocco's history and culture, and was a generally cheerful and enthusiastic guide for the entire week, despite being stuck with the nine of us!* The drive between some points (e.g. Merzouga to Fes) can be quite long. This is unavoidable given how large Morocco is, but something to be aware of as you plan your itinerary. We actually didn't mind the long drives as it gave our group time to talk between points.HIGHLIGHTS* Morocco is so large and diverse that after 1 week we felt like we'd had a month's worth of experiences. From the gorges of the Dades Valley to the Atlas Mountains to the Sahara to the beaches of Essaouira, it's hard to believe we did so much in such a short period of time. * The overnight tour into the Sahara was truly astounding. I don't want to ruin it for anyone by divulging too many details, but suffice to say that this was the best part of our trip, which is saying a lot--if you come to Morocco, you MUST do this.* The riads Iddir booked were awesome--especially the riad in Dades and the Dar in Fes.* Iddir will make sure you get to fully experience the food and music of Morocco. Again, I don't want to ruin any surprises :)* The Medina in Fes has some fascinating history, and the local guide Iddir found for us was very friendly and informative.* At the end of our trip, we decided that we wanted to add Essaouira to our itinerary, and asked Iddir and the driver if they would be willing to extend the trip. They were very flexible and made this happen on virtually no notice, including finding us a place to stay and taking care of all logistics.* Morocco may be the most Instagrammable place on the planet. You're going to leave with a trove of unbelievable photos.GROUP SIZE* Iddir mentioned that he has had groups large and small (from solo travelers to groups with 50+ people). For our group of 9 people, we used a large van to drive around Morocco, but with a smaller group Iddir said he uses a 4x4."

Four women, friends for over thirty years enjoyed a wonderful tour starting in Marrakesh and ending in Fes. Our guide was extremely knowledgable of the area, having grown up in the Sahara region and living in various regions of Morocco. Iddir took us over the Atlas mountains stopping at various nights along then way. A highlight of our trip was a camel ride into the Sahara and overnigting in a Berber camp. This was a fabulous way to visit regions of morocco with a true local! We sampled dates in Erfoud ( date capital), visited a fossil shop with its own quarry, listened to traditional Berber music, rode camels into the sunset and enjoyed many stops at beUtufl historic sights along then ay. At the same time we saw a large part of the Moroccan landscape in all its splendor. Marvelous Morocco Tours made our fist to morocco unforgettable!"

            "review": "Best Part of our Time spent in Morroco. Having reviewed previous comments on trip advisor my friend and I decided that this was the tour we wanted to go on and Iddir didn't let us down. From the moment we contacted him to organise by email until the moment he dropped us off in Fes he couldn't have been more helpful and kind. He made the trip an amazing experience. From picking us up in our difficult to find Riad in Marrakech we headed off on our 3nights 4day Sahara adventure. The hotels we stayed in we're all lovely, even the tents in desert were very comfortable and nice. Iddir was very informative and fun he gave us the history of the towns and cities we passed through in the Atlas Mountains, and stopping were we wished for some photos. We even got the chance to meet some of his family which was really lovely. We also met a nomad family who were also very kind and gave us some Berber whisky ( tea!). The only downside to our trip was that we were sorry we didn't book a longer trip with Iddir to show us more of Morroco. So if you can I would recommend Marvelous Morocco tours to see as much of Morroco as you can - it's a great place Even when we finished our trip in Fes, Iddir dropped us an email to see how we were getting on and if we needed any guidance or recommendations. P.s don't play UNO with him... He cheats! Only messing it was great fun. Book it and enjoy :-)"

As a rule I have traveled independently and was at first not sure about the need for a tour. It was quickly apparent that this was the way to see the Morocco beyond the sites of the cities. We (a group of 4 friends) signed up for the 4 day 3 night tour beginning in Marrakech and ending in Fez. We had great opportunities to take (hundreds of) photos, visit extraordinary attractions, ride camels, hike dunes at sunset and sunrise. And just to talk and learn about this beautiful country.Iddir's enthusiasm, particularly for the desert area and nomad life was apparent from the beginning. And it was impossible to not be caught up in his passion for his land. He gave us time to enjoy our visit, while making sure we didn't miss anything along the way. The tour with Iddir felt more like a trip of discovery with a new Moroccan friend. I would enthusiastically recommend this tour to anyone thinking to visit Morocco."

Never thought I'd say it- but listen to your mother. I do have faith that we could have navigated Morocco sufficiently, however Iddir's tour optimised our time, and gave us the breathing space to truly enjoy the magnificent country that is Morocco.For any of you researching companies, I can vouch that I did too and by far this is the best I found. And not only has it lived up to my expectations, but it has also exceeded them. Iddir's passion for the country is so evident when speaking to him, and is was the quiet moments spent with him discussing nomadic customs in the desert that really felt authentic. Every company you will find can tick the sights off your list, but Iddir's authenticity and passion makes his company something truly special. Also, the flexibility is great! You want to go somewhere? No problem! You have a mother who wants to stop for photos every kilometre...sure thing! (Of course you still have to make it to the destination as I continually reminded my mum)Thankyou Iddir for a magical trip."

I went expecting to fall in love with the scenery and views. I left having fallen in love with the Berber people and culture. Prior to arriving in Morocco, I had emailed Iddir several times to plan the trip. His responses were always prompt, thorough, and friendly. It was a pleasure to finally meet him after so much communication leading up to the trip. Iddir had taken care of every detail of our tour. We felt incredibly welcome and did not have to worry about anything. In addition to his vast knowledge of Moroccan history and culture, Iddir kept us entertained with funny stories and riddles along the way. This was by far the most memorable trip I have taken - and I could not have planned it on my own. Iddir's expertise, relationships with other people along our journey, and welcoming presence are what made this trip so special. We truly felt like family by the end of our tour, and leaving Morocco was like saying goodbye to a dear friend. I will definitely be back again and will always trust Iddir to help me get the most out of my visits. I cannot recommend his services highly enough!"

            "review": "Truly, a trip of a lifetime.. My boyfriend and I finished our 11 day tour earlier this month with Ibrahim followed by Iddir, and it was absolutely the most memorable and wonderful experience. If you are looking for an authentic and truly welcoming tour of the insanely beautiful country that is Morocco, this is the team to guide you. The exceptional private tour is completely catered to you, and you are guided by a marvellous guide (who drives you in their spacious, comfortable vehicles) and they welcome you like family.It is the furthest thing away from the grossly overpacked buses of 30-40 people who are herded around like cattle from tourist trap to tourist trap (during our trip we even had others who were having an awful experience ask for the name of our driver and tour company).I could go on and on about how absolutely great this team is, so I'll try to keep it brief by providing some details and tips in point form:Planning- I started with a simple email, just letting them know we were looking for an 11 day tour on specific dates- I was provided 3 levels of accommodations to chose from, and we opted for the luxury accommodations as it was a special occasion (and if it is within your budget, do chose this option - it was like living like kings and queens, including staying at a riad that Bono stayed in at Fes)- After my obsessive combing of trip advisor forums and lonely planet guide books, I was ready to ask for some fairly specific stops - none of which I needed to say, because Iddir really truly has thought of everything, and is immensely experienced. He has planned more private tours than I ever hope for the rest of my entire life. (Basically, just trust in Iddir - he really knows what he is talking about, he has gone through his beautiful country upside down and sideways - trust his recommendations)- Before the trip, we had sent Iddir a nominal deposit via Western Union and paid the remainder when we met up with him.Logistics & Tips- Airport pick up and drop off - though our guided trip did not technically start until the day after we arrived, we booked the hotel through this team and it included airport pick up and drop off, which was immensely appreciated. It meant that we landed and did not have to stress out about haggling over taxi prices or struggling to find riads or anything of that sort. Very thoughtful detail.- Our trip was a one-way direction as, we arrived in Casablanca and departed in Marrakesh. If possible, try to do the same as to avoid losing precious time going back over the same sites you have already seen.- Our absolute favourite night was the night in the desert after our camel trek - if possible, do the two nights, you won't regret it. (Also, have a small bag/backpack as taking your gigantic airplane-sized luggage isn't really convenient on camels - you can leave your luggage safe and sound at the riad at the edge of the desert)- Best bit of advice? Try the BBQ! After a few days of eating couscous and tagine (though amazing and delicious) you will crave a little something else, and the BBQ places are to die for, amazing meat grilled to perfection. The guides will know which ones are best and worth going to.- If like me, you also intend to support the womens co-ops for the hand made goods from Morocco, trust your guides to recommend you to the right places. Some of the shops in especially the big city medinas are not so reliable - our one shopping tip we received was to buy the goods where you can see them being made, which was great advice.Regardless of if you have just a handful of days or a couple of weeks, you will be in great hands with Marvelous Morocco Tours.They will welcome you like an old friend, take you to the places off the beaten path that big tour buses cannot ever go to, and share with you more about their culture and country than you could ever learn from even a million online reviews.To Iddir and his team, a million thanks! Shukran & Sa-haa!"

We have always travelled independently so I was a little apprehensive about taking a tour. However we could not have been in better hands. Iddir, the passionate, knowledgeable and inspirational owner of this bespoke touring company, lead us on a fantastic trip though his diverse and interesting country. From the cities to mountains, from small villages to the beautiful desert country of his heart, Iddir was a font of knowledge and information who never tired of our questions or photo stops. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy, taking us to a mix of well-known sights and the less-worn paths, along the way educating us about Moroccan and Berber history and culture and keeping us entertained with his wry humour (and terrible jokes!) Iddir clearly greatly enjoys and cares deeply about what he does, and has great interest in and understanding of people, all of which mean his tours are unforgettable. In the words of my daughter \"Morocco wouldn't have been quite as awesome without Iddir\" I really did not want to leave and hope I will be able to come back again to spend more time in the desert with Iddir. If you are looking for a great, authentic, individual tour of Morocco, you need look no further than Marvelous Morocco Tours - you will not be disappointed"

It was one of the best decisions we could have made. Iddir was very quick to respond with a customized itinerary and the price seemed very fair. We sent Iddir a deposit through Western Union before leaving to Morocco, and spent a few days in Marrakesh on our own before starting the tour. On the assigned day our tour guide Mohammed Maazouz showed up on time at our riad with a clean and comfortable SUV. I can't say enough nice things about Mohammed. Polite, kind, respectful, a good and safe driver, and so knowledgeable about Morocco. Mohammed is Berber and grew up in the Sahara desert. He entertained us with stories of his childhood as well as giving us historical information about the cities and sites we visited. Because it was just me and my partner and Mohammed traveling together, Mohammed was able to personalize our trip every day, asking us what types of sites we wanted to see, where and what we preferred to eat, and how much time we wanted to spend at each place. For example, one morning he asked us, \"What are you in the mood for today? There is a wonderful market we could stop at on the way to Merzouga if you are in the mood to shop, or if you prefer we could visit a salt mine or an abandoned casbah I know of that is off the track of most tours.\" When we wanted to buy souvenirs he was very helpful in advising us if things were a good price, or telling us to wait until the next city or market. He never pushed us to buy from any sellers.He took us a few times deep into the desert off the road to meet local berber families. This was probably the highlight of our trip as we were able to spend time with actual families in there homes, sharing tea and learning about their life in the desert. It was fascinating! We met other tourists in Fez that had been on similar group tours and they were surprised when we told them how wonderful and personal our tour had been. They described their tour as being a large group that was shuffled and hurried along from site to site and mediocre group meals. Our experience couldn't have been more different than that, and it seemed like they had paid a much higher price for their tour.Mohammed was always cheerful and pleasant to spend time with. I feel as if we not only had a wonderful guide, but also made a new friend."

            "review": "Excellent trip. My friends and I visited Morocco in February. We started our trip in Marrakech, where we beforehand booked a 3-day trip by email with Marvelous Morocco Tours and arranged all the detailes prior to our departure. The trip was excellent, Iddir is a great driver and tourist guide and always in a good mood. He was explaining us all the way and was trying to bring us Africa closer. We started our trip in Marrakech and passing Atlas to come to the other side, closer to the Sahara. We saw lots of very interesting places - everything as posted on their website. We spent the first night in a very nice hotel with great food. The next day we continued exploring the other side of Atlas. Iddir prepared one very nice surprise - a lunch at his sister's house which made the trip even more familiar. and the whole experience more authentic. We finally arrived to the trekking point. Probably one of the best parts of the trip, riding kamels in beautiful Sahara. The berber camp is also fantastic: very well equiped (water, showers, european toilets and one or two bedroom tents). We had dinner there and then the berber party. The third day we were trying to get to Fes. However due to some bad weather (snow in Atlas) we spent the night in a hotel in the middle of Atlas (all arranged by Iddir) and the next day we arrived to Fes. I can definitely recommend this trip - it is worth the price. You get what you pay."

My friend and I had a tour with Iddir through Marrakesh and beyond and it was one of the most enjoyable holiday experiences I have ever had. Iddir and the rest of his team were extremely well organized at every turn and my friend and I both felt safe and at ease for the entire trip. Everything was planned perfectly and went off without a hitch.I can't recommend Marvellous Morocco tours enough. This is hands down the best way to experience all of Morocco has to offer! The time I spent in Morocco will stay with me for the rest of my life. :)"

            "review": "Really nice way to see the Moroccan desert. It was my first trip to Morocco and we were stationed in Casablanca and wanted to see the desert. I found Iddir through Trip Advisor and our time with him was well worth it. We didn't have an agenda and hadn't done much research and just let Iddir lead the way. The SUV was very comfortable and Iddir told us about the towns as we passed through each of them. One major highlight for me is that he took us to his sister's house for lunch. It was a great way to really get a glimpse of local life and the meal we had there was an AMAZING Berber pizza. Seriously, I wish I could get that in the states. In hindsight, something I would recommend ,and will keep in mind for next time, would be to do a little more research so I could tailor my trip to the types of things I like to do. For example, we were driving through a town on a day when they happen to have their local outdoor market so I asked if we could visit it. Iddir was happy to oblige and I'm glad I got to see it.Marvelous Morocco Tours was really a great way to be introduced to the desert!"

I had the opportunity to extend a work trip in Morocco and do some exploring with my colleague. Being two younger women we were hesitant to travel alone, and the your was definitely the way to go. Iddir's upbeat attitude and well organized tour allowed us to relax and enjoy authentic Morocco. I'd absolutely recommend it for anyone looking to travel Morocco and isn't opposed to time in the car."

They got us exaclty where we wanted to go without us fumbling with directions.Mohommad went out of his way to tell us jokes and keep us entertained. The vehicle was air conditioned and in great condition. Mohommad and Brahim went ouf of their way in offering to escort us to dinner and walking with us anywhere (we didn't need it as everyone in Morocco was so friendly).We saw things that we never would have seen without them. The camel trek they set up was awesome as well. They even took us to a local fish market and helped us order firsh, have it prepared, and eat like the locals!Overal, it was a great trip! I would highly recommend Marvelous Morocco for all of your travelling needs. They made our trip a breeze and everything they booked and organized was great (guides, hotels, etc.). This is by far THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL in Morocco!"

            "review": "Top Notch Quality. Travelling with Marvelous Morocco Tours is the ultimate way to experience Morocco. As a seasoned traveler, I have experienced some truly wonderful guides and some insanely terrible guides - Our tour guide, Iddir, was the best guide anyone could even possibly imagine.My friend and I, both females in our mid-20's, decided to go to Morocco for a last minute holiday tour. From the get-go, Iddir was extremely responsive to our emails never letting our questions go unanswered. This was a clear sign of the great experience we were to have.Upon arrival, Iddir was prompt and on time to pick us up from the airport so that we did not have to wait. He then communicated to us our plans for the day. He moved efficiently through our day so that we could maximize the amount we saw. Iddir knew exactly the best places to stop to take pictures without us having to even ask. As we were settling into our lodging accommodations, Iddir was always there to ensure that we were happy with our room and would go out of his way to find us a new room if there was something we would have preferred. He kept our preference in mind as the tour proceeded.There is a clear passion Iddir shows for his work as he deeply cares for the enjoyment of the tourists. He was extremely attentive and never let a request go unanswered.Prior to enlisting with the tour, my friend and I worried that if we were joining a tour, we would not have enough time to explore the cities by ourselves. Need not worry! Iddir's tours are completely customize-able and allows time for tourists to go and discover the city on their own if they please.Traveling with Iddir was a magnificent experience as it almost seemed like we were on a road trip with a lifetime friend - who happened to be extremely knowledgeable. Iddir is perfect for all ages as he is timely, professional, and communicates well. My friend and I never had to ask Iddir for our plans as Iddir made the initiative to inform us what we would be doing and what we may need.Marvelous Morocco Tours (MMT) made our trip go extremely smoothly. Never once were my friend and I stressed, worried, or unhappy with any of the accommodations, plans, or communications. We had originally thought we could plan a trip around Morocco, but after experiencing the tour with MMT, we realized that we could never have planned a trip like the tour. Nor would the trip have been the same without Iddir.I only wish I had more friends to refer to MMT.Also, Iddir knows where the best couscous is."

            "review": "Traveling with your own private guide and driver is the way to go. Iddir collected us from Marrakech and we were off on an adventure. Comfortably sitting in the back of his 4wd vehicle we were up, up, up into the Atlas mountains. Iddir shared his vast knowledge of his country with us. Since he was born in these mountains it was extensive. As a Berber who grew up in the area we were traveling in he knew it all and shared his knowledge with us. We definitely got the insiders view. Being alone we could ask to stop when we wanted and ask to see places not on the itinerary, too. The highlights of the trip for me were visiting a nomad dwelling in a cave really far removed from everything and everyone then another nomad family in a tent in the desert, having a lovely couscous lunch in the home of Iddir's sister, and the icing on the cake was camping in the sand dunes after riding in by camel. If you are fortunate enough to have the opportunity to do this trip, do it. You will not regret having gone."

The vehicle we were in was brand new and in perfect condition with great air con which was needed in the heat!Everything except lunch was included but even with lunches they had arranged discounts for us. One day we were even invited into their sisters house for lunch and to make their nieces and nephews practice their english.The hotels they arranged were clean, with great food and all had swimming pools which was a bonus.I had an amazing holiday, saw so much and will highly recommend them to friends, family and everyone using Tripadvisor!"

We were not disappointed! Iddir was a wonderful tour guide, with much cultural, historical and personal knowledge of the country. Our trip from Marrakech through the desert and up to Fez, was one of the highlights of our trip. We REALLY enjoyed the camel ride and the stay in the desert. The trip was a lot of fun and we had the opportunity to take some absoultely amazing photography. Overall, Iddir and Marvelous Morocco Tours gave my friend and I a rare view into Moroccan culture and history and it was very easy considering the planning was all done by Marvelous Morocco Tours. I would recommend this tour to anyone interested in seeing a beautiful country, learning and experiencing more through a very knowledgable and personable guide and making some amazing memories."

We chose Iddir thanks to tripadvisor reviews and also his prompt answers to our emails all the way upto the night before the trip. We were not disappointed! He and Ibrahim (with his amazing driving) thought of everything and went above and beyond our expectations. The lunch at his sister's, the aromatic rose garlands, the curious vegetables we sampled, etc, were great surprises in addition to a very well planned and narrated tour. Mustafa, our camel-driver/guide/chef/drummer/entertainer in the heart of the desert was amazing too."

            "review": "Simply Marvelous. I would highly recommend this tour service. Iddir is a very kind, professional, and knowledgeable guide considerate of guests\u2019 safety and comfort. The trip was well coordinated. The Toyota (or Japanese camel) was new and our driver, Abraham was very skilled. Our lodgings were clean and comfortable, especially the lavish desert tents complete with traditional rugs and real beds! For dinner we lounged on silk pillows and ate delicious foods. ****SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAVELERS:START and END IN DIFFERENT CITIES- The tours offered in Morocco involve quite a bit of driving, I would suggest starting in one city and ending in another to avoid repetition.BRING STOMACH MEDICINE FROM HOME- The chances of getting food poisoning in Morocco are higher than in other countries. Bring pepto bismol, Imodium etc. Also meds for motion sickness as the roads can be quite curvy. Unfortunately my friends and I did get sick from some food we ate in Marrakesh\u2019s main plaza and we were unprepared.BRING- Sunscreen, small flashlight, wetwipes, good walking shoes and comfortable pants for the camel trek.Once again we thank Iddir and Abraham for a wonderful experience. We are lucky to have met such nice people who are eager to share their traditions, culture, and history with travelers."

The children were soooooo happy seeing all that sand, they started playing, running and gliding immediately. The camelride was beautiful,the silence in the desert, arriving just before sunset! What a good and nice guide is Iddir, he knows a lot about the desert, speaks a lot of languages and makes everybody happy and laughing, even our 4-year old, who really does not speak any English. We had a wonderful experience during the tour and in the desert, and we will really recommend Marvelous Morocco Day Tours!"
