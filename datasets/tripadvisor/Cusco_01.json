            "review": "It's so much more than Chocolate!!!!!!!!! You HAVE TO DO THIS!!. After a week long trip of Hiking Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu we ended our Trip with a few days in Cusco. With so many tours to choose from we came upon The Faces of Cusco. Our Concierge in our Hotel (Palacio del Inka) highly reccomended this Tour. So let me tell you........Look no further, this \"One Tour\" highlights exactly what is needed, and then some! You start your tour at a unique location right in the heart of Cusco City. Surrounded by Cathedral's, Musuem's and shopping with beautiful fountains and village squares. Vinay and Rivka greet you as you walk in, and tables are set up for Painting and making Chocolates. You immediately say to yourself, hmmm ok some down time, good drinks nice conversation ... all true until Rivka breaks out the Local Music Instruments and before you know it - you are standing on a stage and creating music like you are a Rock Star! Rivka's knowledge of the area and the history immediately transforms you into one of the locals and you find yourself excited for the next step of the tour. It truly is a unique experience, after a fantastic time... Kevin appears with his soon to be Protege from Texas \"Vanessa\", and they both take our group out and about in town. The team spent months perfecting the tour, visiting people and places that would make it what it is today. Make it - exactly what tourists need and want, everything was interesting no down time dragged out. Quick Tour of the City and a 1/2 day at the Market. You will see local items, none of the tourist trap gifts. You will learn their food, their traditions and their customs. The local vendors take the time to show you anything you have an interest in... Chocolate, Coffee, Cheese, Potatoe's, Ceramics it's amazing with a story for each. It truly is the perfect day and beleive me when you are done with the tour you will feel comfortable enough to do it yourself the next day ! Cusco is a GREAT CITY! and a must on a trip to Peru! Vinay, Rivka, Kevin & Vanessa make the perfect team for your perfect trip, which will be unforgettable."

            "review": "Made us feel at home in Cusco . What a great experience!! Vinay, the owner of Faces of Cusco, and his team, Rivka, Vanessa, etc. have created a unique experience for those visiting Cusco. We were recommended, by our concierge Carlos at Palacio Del Inka, to try a tour of the local San Pedro market and meet the vendors selling their wares. We spoke with the various people selling their fruits, vegetables, breads, etc. and we were able to learn more about their culture and traditions than in any other setting. Although it is hard to escape the \"Turista\" experience in Cusco, Faces of Cusco definitely aims to go beyond and establish relationships with the locals, and it shows. Apart from Machu Picchu, this was the highlight of our trip.We were so impressed by the Mercado tour we asked about other events provided by FoC. They offer a number of different events (chocolate making, wine pairing, etc.) but we decided on the Pisco making event. So much fun! Vinay made us feel like we were hanging out at his home (with the giant map) and we learned so much about Pisco and how to make different drinks. A \"must do\" event if you like learning about local flavors and history in a fun, participative environment."

Vinny and Rivka was so professional, fun, energetic, and just all around fun. Not only did we do our chocolate, did wine tasting, but we also talked about anything and everything. After touring throughout the week of September 6-8 in Cusco, it was a change of pace to do something local. I cannot rave enough about this place and how much fun we had. When in Cusco, please add this excursion to your iteniary! You will not disappoint."

As it is a small group tour there is a lot of flexibility and you can ask questions about any topic. San Pedro market was fun as we learnt about some of the souvenirs and their history to the food.

            "review": "Market Tour - Best Tour in Cusco. I did the market tour with Vinay and Noelia and it was hands down the best tour I've experienced in Cusco and arguably one of the best tours I've ever had. Vinay and Noelia were incredibly knowledgeable about the city and Incan culture. It was a pleasure chatting with them about everything from Incan society to their daily lives in Cusco. It felt less like a tour and more like friends hanging out. The tour was split to be about a quarter city tour and three quarters market tour.The market tour was amazing. Vinay and Noelia personally knew all the best venders and we got to sample the best of the market. Not wanting to spoil anything I will just say that all the food we sampled was simply delightful and there were so many new tastes I have not experienced before. Furthermore Vinay and Noelia directed us to venders that sold their wares at prices way below any my girlfriend and I have seen in the city.They ended the tour by recommending a few food places that they really enjoyed. We only had time to go to two of them but both were so delicious and easily the best meals we've had in Cusco.In short, I cannot say enough good things about this tour. It blew us away and I highly recommend it for anyone who comes to Cusco."

Vinay spent almost three hours walking us through the San Pedro Market and also gave great background on the history and culture of Cusco and the Incans. He was extremely accommodating and told us that this tour was ours and he went above and beyond in insuring that we had an awesome time. Loved sampling the different fruits, cheeses, and chocolates, and it was obvious that he and the Faces of Cusco team have developed great relationships with the vendors. I know they also offer some other programs such as an introduction to Peruvian wines, painting your own local crafts, and chocolate making. Wish I had more days in Cusco so that I could do those too!"

While we were touring the market we loved that our tour guides had real conversations with the vendors. You could really tell that Faces of Cusco has established great relationships with the local people and that they really care about the people we were introduced to. We saw some other tour guides that just walked their clients through the market pointing out various things, but we actually stopped and chatted and had the significance of various wares and foods explained to us. While walking around the city they gave great tips on which places were good to eat at or shop at and made us feel very well taken care of. Faces of Cusco is highly, highly recommended - the best way to spend a few hours in Cusco!!!"

            "review": "Best Market Tour & the Chocolate workshop was excellent too!. I had planned to do a chocolate workshop at the ChocoMuseo until I saw the Tripadvisor listing for Faces of Cusco. Why just make chocolate, when you can make cocolate while sipping an adult beverage!We made eight chocolates with our choice of a variety of fillings, milk chocolate and dark chocolate. While our chocolates were hardening we painted the typical ceramic bulls. I chose to sip a glass of wine, but other beverages were available including the non-alcoholic variety. This was a fun, relaxing way to spend a couple of ours (or 90 minutes, I don't recall exactly). The experience of making these items that many visitors purchase, gave me a greater appreciation for the artisans who create the handicrafts available in the shops and on the streets. This workshop would be fun and appropriate for children as well as adults.This workshop was of such excellent quality that I decided to take the Market Tour with them instead of simply visiting on my own. This was one of the best decisions I made in Cusco. The Faces of Cusco have done their homework. They knew many of the vendors and had developed a relationship with them that allowed us the opportunity to take photos at each stall we visited. We had two guides; one to guide us through the market and explain everything that we saw and one to help us take better photos. We also had the chance to sample some of the fresh fruits and vegetables that were new to us, as well as a few other goodies. These samples were included in the tour (no additional cost to us) and the vendors were paid directly. I appreciate giving business to the local population.I have been a Tour Director/Guide for twenty years, and Faces of Cusco is one of the best tour experiences I have ever had. I can't recommend them highly enough. If I am ever back in Cusco, I will look to see if they are offering a tour or class that fits into my schedule. They provide an excellent experience for a reasonable price."

We were told we had to book in advance online for the afternoon class. We went on their website and had difficulties therefore emailed them, they responded right away and offered us a discount for the difficulties we were having. When we arrived the staff were very nice and informed us about the history of the chocolates which was interesting and you could tell they had a passion for what they were doing. We were given the choice of many beers and wines they had after we had made our chocolates and they even went further to reccomend bars for us to visit in Cusco which was a massive help for us. The decor was incredible and quirky and we felt very cosy here, if you have the opportunity to go here don't pass it. Highly reccomended, thanks for the fun evening and incredible tasting chocolates guys!"

Everyone at Faces of Cusco were so friendly and professional. We had the lovely Vinnay showing us around and because we weren't in a hurry he showed us round the local area and gave us a bit of a history lesson too! The market was great and we had fun meeting some of the locals and buying souvenirs. Vinnay even suggested some great places to eat and get some last minute walking kit we'd forgotten. He gets on so well with everyone and has such a vast knowledge of the area and the people, it's lovely to experience."

Vinay was our guide for the market tour, emailing for a reservation was easy and their location was easy to find. He gave us some pretty valuable advice about adjusting to the altitude, don't eat anything for a couple of hours before you land drink tons of water and stay away from alcohol for the first day or two. My friends and I were the only ones on the tour so Vinay switched things up a little. He showed us around Cusco a little before we went to the market, once we got there it was very evident that he was well liked and knew what he was doing. Overall it was an amazing first experience in Cusco, we learned a lot about the city and he gave us tons of great advice including some restaurants to check out during our stay. We even went back the next day to watch a soccer game! I would highly recommend them for a tour."

Having someone talking about all these typical produces and knowing where to try them makes a great difference.

We knocked on the door before they were officially open, and were greeted with smiles and welcomes in perfect Spanish and English. They hadn't plan to air the soccer game, but since they didn't have a chocolate class booked that day, they switched gears and put it on! A good sized group of travelers from all over the world showed up, and they served great drinks and food from the restaurant next door. I had a few \"chilcanos,\" which the owner recommended as a locals pisco-based drink, and they were fantastic.

            "review": "So great we went twice!. My wife and I had a phenomenal experience with Faces of Cusco throughout our visit in Cusco. We had emailed Vinny beforehand to discuss class options because they didn't have a \"double class\" option with the two classes we liked most. He was incredibly responsive and so helpful! He even offered to meet up with us to help us learn more about the city of Cusco which was very comforting and appreciated. We ended up participating in two classes- the chocolate making class and the cocktail class. Both were 100% worth it! If we had more time I would take a class with Faces everyday in Cusco. Our chocolate class was with Ivana (unsure of the spelling of her name, so sorry!) She was so kind and even hand drew us a map to guide us to our next place. She had a great extensive knowledge of the restaurants around town and was able to easily give us several good vegetarian options. The class itself was perfect- we were greeted with plenty of drink options- both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. A perfect small size that gave us plenty of opportunity to get to know our other classmates. One of the best qualities about Faces of Cusco is that they make you feel like family. They had gotten wind that we were on our Honeymoon and gave us a small gift at the end of class and organized a great surprise for our cocktail class! So thoughtful! For the cocktail class Kevin was our teacher. Kevin was a phenomenal cocktail teacher!! It was a perfect combination of him teaching us the basics and then letting us guide it with our favorite drinks. The class was completely hands on as well- we were behind the bar doing everything ourselves! We had so much fun. This class is definitely one not to miss in Cusco. Both of our class teachers even offered to take pictures of us throughout the experience so we could focus on having fun. Thank you Faces for such a warm welcome to your home!"

Even though they technically weren't open yet, they let us in and talked to us at length about Cusco in general, giving recommendations and tips. They were super helpful without any obligation to take their classes. My mom and I did end up taking 3 of their classes: chocolate making, market tour, and latin libations. All were unique and fun. My favorite was the latin libations class, it was great to learn drink recipes and I'm sure it would be even more fun if you had a small group of friends. Seems like a very chill and welcoming place, with a great group of people who understand what its like to be a traveler and aren't just trying to get your money. Highly recommend!!"

The guide Ivana was very welcoming and warm, we got to talk a bit and were offered tea infusions.The workshop is very nice, you get to create your own bonbons with a variety of fillings and combinations (peanut butter very salty and yummy).Afterwards we painted some traditional figures of the Inka which really lets you go wild with colors but very gentle with the brush and all along we were served with local handcrafted bevereges ( I got the quinoa beer and my wife tried a white wine). By that time the chocolate hardens and you wrap it in colorful wraps or just eat what you've made.All in all, super fun, great atmosphere, many tips (the colca coffee was great, Thanx!!) And very tasty chocolate. Mucho recommendo"

I am going to put this in a bullet format (hopefully it comes through after I hit enter) so it is easier for people to read the main points of my review. To give my review some credibility, I have been to every continent and dozens of countries. I have NEVER encountered someone as nice and genuine as Vinay and the staff at Faces of Cusco in all of my travels.\u25cf Vinay single handedly made my family's trip to Cusco, Sacred Valley, and Machu Picchu exponentially better\u25cf Before I arrived, Vinay and I talked twice over Skype\u25cf Vinay listened to what I wanted\u25cf Gave great recommendations\u25cf Found great private tours for less than 1/2 of what my hotel was offering for group tours\u25cf Provided advice on places to eat, how to deal with altitude sickness, and general customs\u25cf My wife, son, and I had tons of fun at the Incan Indulgence event. The chocolate was great, ceramic painting was fun, and my wife enjoyed the wine.The only reason I rated Faces of Cusco a 5 is because I could not rate them higher. I cannot say enough EXCELLENT things about them. This small company has singlehandedly raised the bar on international tourism."

Our guides Vinay and Jorge began by giving us a brief lesson of photography. We\u2019re unfamiliar with the ins and outs of photography, so greatly appreciated the quick lesson. The pointers they provided us really enhanced our photos in both Cusco and along the Inca Trail (which we embarked on the next day). After the quick lesson, we began our tour of San Pedro Market, which was fantastic! We felt as if we had a truly authentic Peruvian experience, and really enjoyed sampling the different foods and meeting some of the local people. Vinay and Jorge didn\u2019t push us to buy anything either, and we really appreciated that. We could tell that they truly wanted us to enjoy Cusco as much as they did! With Vinay and Jorge, we felt as if we were hanging out with old pals. They were hilarious, knowledgeable and their zest for life and Cusco was evident and contagious! The customer service they provided exceeded our expectations. For example, Jorge helped with converting images on my memory card to a different format after the tour concluded while Vinay simultaneously gave us a quick lesson on Pisco. Faces of Cusco truly enhanced our time in Cusco, and I can\u2019t recommend them enough! My only regret is not having enough time in Cusco to participate in some of the other tours they offer!"

Vinay was able to give us some very much appreciated tips on where to eat and what to do while we were in Cusco, and helped put our minds at ease about the food.

They were all very knowledgeable at their trade, friendly, and had beautiful personal stories to share.

The class also included wine or craft beers from Peru. The beers were delicious and they had quite a selection! We then moved on to the arts & crafts portion of the class, which was also fun. Overall, it was a fantastic experience which was made even better by the super friendly and knowledgeable staff. Vinay, the founder of Faces of Cusco is an ex-New Yorker who has spent years traveling around the world, including all over Peru.

Cusco can be a city where tourists feel like a constant target and have to guard against being taken advantage of - Faces is the opposite of that. Everyone is earnest, honest, and helpful, and visiting is like being part of a community. It's clearly a business established for travelers by travelers. They offer classes and outings to fill out the experience of Cusco (like market tours, chocolate making, cocktail mixing, etc.) and go above and beyond to help anyone that comes through their door. Words can't describe how at home I felt and how overwhelmed by kindness I was when the staff literally spent hours giving me recommendations on how to spend our time, where to eat, how much things should cost, etc.We did a market tour and the chocolate making class. We were so impressed with the thoughtfulness that has gone into these activities. For instance with the tour, the guide has literally talked to every stall in the market to ascertain which sellers are the most honest and sincere, and developed ongoing relationships with them. Despite the guide being foreign to Peru, this was a more intimate and satisfying experience than ANY we had with a local or native guide while in the country for a month. These experiences would usually be outside our price range, but in this case, I think it's worth it!"

On a lark, we sent a WhatsApp message to Faces of Cusco and Vinay answered immediately. He asked if we would like to meet for coffee and go over options. We figured, \"Why not?\". So, we met up at Morena, a cute restaurant/cafe near the main plaza, and Vinay spent about 45 minutes understanding our interests and giving us local recommendations. After learning our interests, he put us in touch with the planetarium in Cusco (which was AMAZING!), and a B&B in the Sacred Valley called Casa de Tres Osos (where we went on a hike, had an amazing home cooked meal, and made wonderful friends!). We saved our last day in Cusco for activities located at Faces of Cusco. We spent the early afternoon at Faces of Cusco learning how to Salsa and the evening learning how to make Latin drinks. We had SO much fun at both classes! We highly recommend contacting Faces of Cusco as soon as you arrive in Cusco, so that you can make the most of your time there. On another note, when there were protests that interfered with transport on our way to and out of Puno, we contacted Vinay and he said that he would help us out if we got stranded in Puno. Luckily, it didn't come to that, but it was so nice to know we had someone local to turn to if we needed a bit of help!

Faces is a group of passionate people, led by Vinay Raval, himself a backpacker and an avid student of Cusco's rich culture. Faces offers several activities that will help you to experience the local culture more fully. From a photography class at the local market to a chocolate making class, wine tasting, ceramic painting, a dance class, to and an informal get-together of visitors and ex-pats alike in the evening -- the activities are fun and allow you to meet local people and visitors to the town, hear their stories, and feel enriched by the interaction. Vinay and his team are also one of the best sources of information about the ins and outs of what Cusco has to offer. You want a recommendation? They got it! Just ask them a question, they will help you gladly! I took a photography class with Jorge. Vinay joined on the tour of the market and introduced us to several local growers/vendors. We heard their stories, tried their food, and took plenty of photographs, while Jorge, a professional photographer himself, advised us on how to make the photos look and feel more professional. Faces of Cusco helped to shape my amazing experience in Cusco. A huge thanks to Vinay, Jorge, and the entire team."

            "review": "AMAZING PLACE AND AMAZING EMPLOYEES, made our entire trip to Peru unforgettable. I don't even know where to start talking about how incredible Faces of Cusco was for our visit to Peru. I traveled to Peru for 2.5 weeks with one friend, both of us 25 year old women. We planned to spend 3 days in Cusco prior to doing the inca trail hike, and signed up for the chocolate and wine making class at faces of cusco to treat ourselves after we returned from the hike. (See end of this review for specific discussion of this class).Vinay, the founder of faces of cusco, reached out to us prior to our visit to Peru to offer advice. We skyped with him for over 2 hours and he gave us information on food, things to bring, altitude, safety, things to do, what to see, not just in cusco but also in the other areas of Peru we were visiting. He did this with absolutely no agenda and without pressuring us to purchase any other services from Faces of Cusco. He genuinely wanted us to have the best experience we could in Peru and to provide as much help as possible. After we arrived in Cusco, Vinay offered to meet us to provide more detailed information on our trip. He met us and again gave us a plethora of information about Cusco's history, culture, sights to see and places to eat. He even walked around with us pointing out landmarks and interesting sights on our first day. It was a fantastic orientation to the city. However, his help didn't stop there. My friends suitcase was lost and Vinay even offered to accompany us to the airport to help with Spanish translation to ensure we got her suitcase--which we did with ease thanks to Vinay. Vinay also assisted us in setting up a day tour of the sacred valley sights with absolutely no gain to himself. He put us in touch with a trustworthy local tour company, and helped us build the tour around things that were of interest to us--seeing Incan sites, visiting a small village, and visiting a local brewery (Sacred Valley Brewery) with a driver and guide. The day trip was a fantastic experience and different than most touristy options that are offered. I believe it was based on a tour that Faces of Cusco may be setting up independently in the near future which I would recommend to any traveler. We also attended several of Faces of Cusco casual evening events where you can have drinks, meet other travelers, or even watch sports games. This gave us a safe space to hang out at night and an immediate group of friends in Cusco. We met other employees at Faces of Cusco and each was equally as kind and helpful as Vinay. By the end of our time in Cusco it really felt like we had a family and support network there. It absolutely made the difference in our trip to Peru, it would not have been the same without Faces of Cusco. Now to review the actual class we took at Faces of Cusco:The chocolate and wine class was taught by Yvana and was even better than I expected. You spend the first part of the class making your own chocolates with tons of delicious fillings. Then you drink wine and paint your choice of pottery pieces. It was the perfect relaxing activity for an afternoon, and Yvana was incredibly friendly, fun, and knowledgeable. The chocolates were DELICIOUS, and the pottery made a great souvenir. The wine didn't hurt either. I would absolutely recommend the class as a great way to experience local culture while taking a break from the hectic and tiring aspects of travel. Yvana also gave us extensive recommendations about things to do and see in Lima where we were traveling next. Vinay also gave us an informal version of the San Pedro market tour, which was so fun and informative. He knows so much about local culture, produce, farming, and crafts that it really feel like he is a local himself. He showed us around different booths and told us the history of mask making, chocolate making, potato farming, high altitude coffee, and other foods. I would definitely recommend the market tour if you have any interest in food or culture, as you will learn more from Vinay than I think anyone else in Cusco. It turned what would have been a 10 minute passive visit to the market into an active and fun learning experience along with demonstrations and free samples! We looked closely at things I would have walked right by and barely noticed. He can also fit the tour to your specific interests or desires, for example if you are a chocolate or coffee lover he can spend a lot of time on these topics. If you are traveling to Cusco no matter what your interests are please consider taking a class or tour with Faces of Cusco, it is truly a unique business run by amazing and genuine people who know more than anyone else I met about Peru (yes, even more than some tour guides we had for example on the Inca Trail) and want to help travelers have the best trip possible. I could not have imagined a more helpful, kind group of people and am so glad that we were able to spend time with them in Cusco!"

I always feel so welcomed and immediately at home. Vinay will greet you by name (if you're new this won't take long!) and take your things to put away for you. You can do the sort of things that only happen when you have a community feeling, like sit and play a game, leave your things unattended, change the music yourself or chat to the staff... I also love their attention to detail with things such as beer bottle jackets, free water, beautiful bathroom. The staff go out of their way to make sure you have a good time."

From providing a great place to hang out and laugh with other travelers from around the world, to clarifying some of the mysteries of Machu Picchu and its inhabitants, Vinay and his crew brought my trip to a whole new level. It's a little amusing to see it labelled an \"attraction,\" because it's a bit of a bar, bit of a restaurant (so far), and about ten attractions in one. The San Pedro Market tour and photography lesson is remarkable--they have made personal relationships with the nicest vendors there (I got an awesome papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask from Vladimir Ilich (!!), and the cheeses are awesome and so fresh!), so you can interact without feeling like a stranger. ...And that's really the key to all the experiences they offer...you feel like a member of an extended family there. All the folks are widely travelled or in the process of traveling, and know the mindset and needs of the peripatetics who pass through.Go to one event and I'm sure you'll want to stick around for more...whether the chocolate, wine, and art class (that I nearly missed my plane for!) with the multitalented Yvana and Clara, the Cajon class from Jorge (S\u00ed, se\u00f1or!), Kevin's lime-carving-and-tasty-bebida-making class (the perfect pisco sour, and the multi-layered crazy whatever it was that I may or may not remember), or Giancarlo's sweet salsa class, you'll be hooked. Oh, and the Machu Picchu presentation that I mentioned above...Clara and Vinay help to inoculate you, with solid scholarship, from the inevitable wild stories and claims you'll hear on your visit to that lovely place. If I write any more I'll want to go back, and I can't afford it just yet...so, to all y'all at Faces, and Brian too...muchachos, k nos veamos muy pronto!"

Chocolate making and ceramic painting were fantastic and well organized in a charming / sparkly clean upstairs facilities. Meeting and chatting with Yvonna was a pleasure. When we finished our chocolate fun and ceramics we stayed for the free and very informative overview of Machu Picchu and the pre-Inka culture. Men you should try both (chocolate making and painting ceramics) you will enjoy it thoroughly like I did. Both are challenging but very gratifying.

We got to meet the locals at the market and really enjoyed the cultural experience. I would definitely recommend this company for anything class or tour they offer."

He took time out of his day to show me and my friend around the San Pedro market to get a closer look at what local life is like in Cusco. He knew a lot of the merchants there and I got to talk to them as well as test out some foods that I've never had before. I could tell a lot of people really appreciated his openness and I am grateful for all the knowledge he shared about the Peruvian way of life. If I wanted to be part of an experience where you can connect with the locals and learn about their culture, I would highly recommend hanging out with the Faces of Cusco! You'll have a blast doing so!!"

Things can always start in a magic way, when you are ready for it.I'm on my life adventure with friends in Cusco, stopping at the Mercedo Central de San Pedro before our flight out. Puzzled by millions of kinds of chocolate, things were not easy either with our limited Spanish. A very nice young man helped with our chocolate choices. And he asked us for a favour of giving US a free tour in the market. What kind of favor is that!? Vinay, one of the founds of Faces of Cusco we later found out, has been doing market research for awhile. He's excited to test out his tours on us. We were nicely surprised by the passion, the knowledge, the relationship between him and the vendors. Even if we've been to the market for a few times, things felt, tasted, and seemed to be all different with stories and history being told, with people being connected.Limited by our time, the tour actually turned out to be the magic half an hour. With much being told and untold, we'd love to go back again. Don't miss Faces of Cusco - they will bring you a great Cusco experience!"

From dancing, to cajon classes to having the unique opportunity of meeting people from all over while making some Pisco cocktails. Definitely gonna go back to do the other workshop classes. An awesome way to stray away from the typical sightseeing in Cusco. Workshop site is super cool and well done and even better are the people running it. A definite must!"

            "review": "a great cultural experience. I came to this place by a friend's recommendation and completely fell in love!The place offers a variety of different workshops that all have to do with the peruvian culture. I have participated in a cocktails' workshop, a salsa's workshop, a chocolate and painting workshop and a dinner night- all of them were super good! The workshops were really professional and fun. It was great to share them with different people from all over the world. The dinner was absolutely wonderful and involved traditional food with a gourmet touch. YUM!But with no doubt the best thing in this place is the amazing staff who runs it. You can actually see their passion and drive for making the best experience possible for their customers.I really recommend everyone who visits Cusco and wants a different and special experience to stop by :)"
