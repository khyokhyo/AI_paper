            "review": "WOW!!. Difficult to describe this fantastic palace - simply think of the superlatives you know! It it almost overwhelming with gold and treasure - a real feast for the eyes. After being very badly damaged during the war the palace has been painstakingly restored using old photographs for reference. The amber room is absolutely fantastic and we were told by our guide that Germany had contributed several millions to the cost of restoration. In my opinion it's certainly worth visiting with a guide so you don't miss anything important and are given information of this nature which you don't find in guide books. We visited last week and apparently this was the last week of the fountains. I would recommend visiting in October - virtually no queues and although the weather was chilly it wasn't bitterly cold. The grounds are beautiful and an added bonus was watching the tame red squirrels and birds which were everywhere. There is a little market just outside the house where you can buy the usual souvenirs - several of our group bought fur hats at considerably lower prices than the shops in St Petersburg after a little bartering. Don't hesitate to visit, it's very special."

            "review": "Way too overcrowded and chaotic. Oh dear. Most museums in Russia have strict rules and time frames for tour groups. This is a relatively small palace so, in theory, they want visitors to keep moving through the rooms, no back tracking, no selfie sticks, no flash photography. Apparently the hordes of Chinese tour groups didn't get or adhere to the memo... Inside the palace it was extremely crowded and we were subjected to Chinese visitors continually shoving their way past our group. Hard to appreciate the opulent beauty of the hall of mirrors or amber room with so many people in a smallish space. On a positive note, it was interesting to see how they reconstructed and restored this palace that was nearly destroyed in WWII. The grounds were also very lovely.The sad thing is that despite that October is considered off season, our group waited 30 minutes beyond our scheduled time to enter the palace. Our guide said that on her summer tours at the height of the season they've waited in line for 3 hours just to enter !"

Considering that it was wrecked by the Nazis and has been completely restored the contents with one exception are original as they were all sent to Siberia! Of course the exception is the Amber Room which has taken 20 years to restore. The rest of the rooms are heavy on gold decor, containing a remarkable collection of Catherine I and Tzarina Elizabeth's artefacts. We had a very knowledgeable guide to show us round. The gardens are also well worth a visit; they were designed by a Scottish architect named Cameron. Can be crowded but well worth a visit."

It's a lot like Versailles, but a lot cheaper!

            "review": "Disappointing. Another attraction I visited many years ago and finally returned now I can appreciate more of the finer details...The experience began with a wait for tickets outside the palace which lasted a spine aching 3 hours (plus). There is little in the way of seating for those in the queue who need it and no shelter from the elements which inevitably turned wet as we stood in line.Upon reaching the front of the queue you are left to your own devices to fathom which ticket to buy, where from and where to go after purchasing your ticket. I appreciate many will have no difficulty in finding their way, but the process and route is far from obvious for some.Once inside the queuing does not end. Each room must evacuate a number of people before more can be let in. This results in bottle necks which are often clogged further by large tour groups thus making a leisurely stroll through the palace impossible.The palace itself is of course beautiful. The main hall with its gold and mirrors is by far the highlight in my opinion although the workmanship of the amber room must also be admired. The interior is so impressive that it is a shame we couldn't see more of it. After waiting so long to enter the entire route took 1 hour, much of which was spent waiting to enter or leave rooms.The ticket prices are also somewhat steep at 1000RUB (approx. \u00a312) for adults or 500RUB if you are a tax paying resident of the Russian Federation.Upon asking a guard whether this was the norm for summer he confirmed that every day is as busy. My advice would be to visit the palace during its opening hours from September to May if you gave the option and frankly I would give it a miss in July or early August."

This spectacular palace is adorned with 'E' all over the place because Catherine is Ekaterina in Russian We knew that crowds would be a problem especially the Chinese tour groups who are new to travel and have not yet learned the concepts of lining up or moving through the building in an orderly group so we booked a private guide with local Alla tours. It is a little more expensive than joining the 'cattle herd' but skips the lines and is well worth it. The palace was largely destroyed by the Nazi's during the second world war but has been painstakingly restored continuously ever since. Much of the furniture and art treasures were saved and hidden in Siberia and gradually returned as restoration continued. Today this is a beautiful palace with Rococo architecture and beautiful colors and gold gilt exterior. Inside are some priceless paintings and antiques and the real highlight a room made entirely of Amber. The original was looted by the Nazi's and in Germany it disappeared. Ten years ago there was enough money to amass 9 tonnes of premium Amber which was hand picked and sorted to get the three tons needed to perfectly recreate the amber room using the old techniques. Fortunately the room was so impressive a 100 years ago there were hundreds and hundreds of photographs for reference. This was the summer palace of Catherine the Great and subsequent Tsars and here, an hour our of town the weather was cooler and the air fresher. I highly recommend a private tour company like Alla for this attraction."

After entering the palace, there was a security line after which you could finally enter the palace. Personally, I stuck on the security line: the first time I had to leave my backpack to the cloakroom although its size was within limits according to the signs and the second time because my ticket expired (it is valid 1 hour after its issuance). So, after a 3-hour waiting-in-line I left without actually visiting the palace.It seems that the palace is not an ideal destination for individual visitors. Really, what's the point of waiting after you enter an attraction? I'm really disappointed of the organisation of this place."

Lovely palace and gardens but spoiled by the tourists who have to stop to take a selfie in front of every single item and room, and when there are large groups of them this spoils it for everyone. I felt very sorry for the lady looking after the Amber room where so many in one group were taking photos where it is forbidden. They even took photos through the threshold of the room. The group should have been removed and the guide not allowed to work here again as he did nothing to help the situation."

Our guide also took us to a cute coffeehouse, which we never would have found without him. Souvenirs should be bought out of town, so this is a good as place as any to buy the usual mementos."

This palace was originally constructed in the 18th century, looted and pretty much destroyed by the Nazis during WW2, but in the intervening 70 years has been painstakingly restored to its former magnificent glory. there is still plenty of work to do in the interior, but there is plenty to see, all of which is wonderful. When we visited it was quite crowded with long lines to get in, but definitely worthwhile. the exterior is ornate with a largely blue, white and gold color scheme, plenty of statues and carvings, some gilded included the gilded domed chapel. The interior is exquisite, with many differently themed rooms, all restored to their original condition with looted artwork brought back home wherever possible. The amber room is simply extraordinary, although it had to be reconstructed entirely from scratch using surviving designs since the original decor was stolen and never found. Part of the lure of this palace for me was the fascinating ongoing long term restoration work, started during the communist era and continuing to this day. One hallway contains photos and information about the destruction caused by the Nazis and it's just amazing that the palace has been so wonderfully restored. Beautiful. The formal gardens are also worth a gentle stroll."

It's a tough call, and there is no doubt that the gardens at the Peterhof are much more impressive, but if you only have time for one, I would visit Catherine's Palace over the Peterhof. To clarify, the gardens at Catherine's Palace certainly can hold up on their own; in fact, there's more variety here than at the Peterhof as there's a French style garden, an English style garden and an Italian style garden, not to mention the huge expanse of woods in front of the palace where Empress Elizabeth enjoyed hunting. However, there is no doubt that the interior of Catherine's Palace put every palace I've seen in the world, and that includes Versailles, to shame. This was opulence at its greatest and shows how the tsars, at their zenith, lived in the most abundant of surroundings. We seemed to go from a grand room, to a grander room, to an even grander room and so on and every room seemed to have more gold leaf, more opulence, more riches. It's just overwhelming. The Amber room was impressive, but it's not a large room and did not impress us as much as the grand salons where the tsars and tsarinas would hold balls, meet heads of state, etc. I can see how a visitor, in those days, would stand in awe of the riches and power of Russia's rulers by just entering one of these rooms. I should also note that there is a very beautiful loggia on a small hilltop where Catherine the Great enjoyed walking during rain. The view of the palace and the gardens from there are just stunning. If you go to St. Petersburg, do try to visit both the Peterhof and Catherine's Palace, but for me, Catherine's Palace was the clear winner."

We had a couple of days in Pushkin and stayed in the hotel next to the park and palace, so we took advantage of the free hours (after 7 pm in the summer). Walked for two hours and it was still daylight. Catherine's palace is nice, but inside only two rooms really matter: amber room (no photography by the way in the room) and the great \"gold\" hall. There are several more rooms, but if you really like to see the interiors of the imperial summer palaces - go to Petehoff (the palace there is much more restored). But just remember that amber room is unique and only in Catherine's palace."

Like all palaces there are loads of tourists that make a visit somewhat stifling. The great hall, with its gold and mirrors overwhelms your senses. This is another example of how over the top the czars lived. The grounds are wonderful. Like a lot of the tourist places in Russiait is better to go with a private car and guide to tell you what you are seeing and to guide you around the throngs of busses. A highlight for us was visiting the amber workshop on the grounds (an additional fee). We learned about amber and how it is used in decoration and jewelry. You see a lot of amber in Rusdia and it was helpful to become knowledgable about what we were seeing."

It took us 1h30min to get inside. The entry of people is controlled and is released only for a certain amount at intervals of 15 minutes.You can take your meal to make a picnic after the visit to the palace in one of the park very nice places. There are several pavilions to visit if you have time. Leave your backpack in the clock room.Search in GMaps the best way to go from your hotel. My husband and I went by subway to Kupchino station.Take the underground passage to the other side of the street to take a Marshrutka number K-342 or K-286 . People are very friendly but if you need some information it is better to ask the young people which speak a little English.The blue and white castle facade with golden domes is stunning.There are different entrances and different routes for individual visitors and guided tours.The must see amber mosaic in Amber Room is impressive. Also do not miss:- The Hall of Light ceiling;- The blue and white stove in White Dining Room;- The charming Green Dining Room;- The blue-and-white painted-silk wallpaper and the superb ceiling in the Blue Drawing Room;- The painted-silk wallpaper in the Chinese Blue Drawing Room.As it is too crowded the security of the rooms do not let you stop to see the details, especially in the amber room that is the most popular. There are so many beautiful things to see that I did not realize how long it took but I think the circuit is seen in 15 minutes which is the time interval that they allow groups entry in the museum. So my husband and I made the circuit again, just admiring the most interesting places like the amber room."

The grounds a meticulously kept and the inside rivals the Palace Versailles.... which it was meant to do. Each room is staged to represent the time of Catherine the Great and does so very well. The Great Hall is very reminiscent of the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles. Beautiful and well worth the visit!"

It's a very beautiful palace, with the stunning rebuild legendary Amber Room, definitely worth the visit. (No photo taken at Amber Room.)There are tons of visitors, always long line, I mean hundreds people. Purchased tickets far in advance. It's very crowded inside, you don't get to walk around by yourself. There is a guideline that everybody follows. We had a private tour guide which is great. She took us in front of the \"tour group\" line (even there were only two of us), she knows where to go. It's a bit intimidating, it's very crowded here and at Hermitage and other famous churches/places in town. It's too bad that Russians are not helpful or friendly, it's hard to find things around. It's great to have a guide."

In this case the rating reflects only that there are so many more spectacular things to see that I would put this lower on the list. There is a reason Catherine went through something like 5 architects - many aspects of the palace are testaments to bad taste in which self-respecting architects wanted no part, including (imo) the krazy-gluing (or whatever the 19th c. equivalent of that is) of an entire room with amber. On the other hand, the story of that particular room's post-war restoration, and who its benefactor was, is wonderful. The palace is enormous and a monument of extensive and often spectacular plaster work, and an abundance of gilt work. Like everything in the region it is still worth seeing... if only to witness proof that you are definitely too wealthy if you have so many priceless masterworks that you can only display them by slicing them from their frames and using them as wallpaper .... and that doing so may be the best way to foment an eventual revolution from the underclasses."

The Catherine Palace is so ornate that there is virtually nothing to compare it to. It is opulent beyond belief. You will go from one room that is the most opulent you have ever seen to another that puts the one previous to shame. The level of wealth and detail is almost staggering.At the same time, it is a monument to the ravages of the Nazis in World War II and the restoration efforts in the decades that have followed. This palace had gone to one of the greatest in the world to a ruin, to the return of its wonder. The amber room, a marvel, has been lovingly restored.We visited at a time when there were practices going on for a staging of Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\". The practices added to the general air of 18th century culture.The Palace is beautiful, and it is a testament to the resilience of the Russian people. It is also astonishingly popular, such that some of the rooms are clogged with groups of tourists. You will want to see this palace, and our advice if you can is not to visit during the busy summer (we could not). Few realize just how wealthy the Romanov Tsars really were and this palace demonstrates not only that their opulence exceeded that of virtually anyone else in the world, but that Russia was able to replicate it again after the vandalism of the retreating Nazis. Remarkable."

Based on recommendations from friends who had been there before, we chose the Catherine Palace and Park tour. The palace has been almost completely restored to its original glory and is amazing in its beauty and ostentation. The Viking tour gets there before it opens, so the crowd was not nearly as large as the one at the Hermatage. Our guide was native Russian and had been to the grounds as a boy when it was much less developed. The grounds around the palace are extensive and equally impressive. We enjoyed this more than our Hermatage tour, partly because the Heratage was so crowded."

I would strongly recommend you take a tour to make sure you get in. We were with TJ tours out of St. Petersburg. This palace is nothing short of amazing, with large rooms of white walls trimmed in gold everywhere. There are beautiful wood floors, and heating furnaces covered with Delft tiles. Be sure to admire the lovely ceilings. What I cannot forget is the famous amber room. The walls are made of panels of small pieces of amber. The way the light hits the amber is just spectacular. No photos are allowed. I imagine a postcard of it could be purchased.Perhaps a better time to visit would be later in the fall to avoid the crowds of people."

And they do have some amazing and strikingly beautiful rooms. In the most special room it is not allowed to take pictures however, which is a serious downside in my book. More importantly, the tour is over within an hour as only a small portion of the palace can be visited. I find it very hard to show enthousiasm when waiting in line takes longer than the actual visit, and being charged over the top. The park around the palace was nice enough, and easily worth the entry price of about \u20ac2."

Perhaps it is our fault, because we went on a Monday (when the Hermitage is closed) and we did not go as part of a tour group, but -- my goodness -- I have never queued for longer in my life (4+ hrs). I attribute at least half of the queue time to the very poor organization of the ticket-purchasing and visitor-management processes, and I detract two stars from my rating for these eminently correctable problems.I'll leave reviews of the park, the palace and its exhibits for other reviews (apart from saying that you must see the Amber Room) and focus on the nightmarish logistics. I know that no one from the venue will see this, much less act upon it, but at least fellow tourists can brace themselves for the inconvenience.First -- when you get to the place (we took Uber: 1000 rubles and totally worth it -- and I'm cheap!), you buy a 120-ruble ticket to get into the park. Once you get into the park, you immediately get into another queue for access to the palace. Of course there are no signs telling you this (not even in Russian) -- so the seller of park tickets has to repeat the same thing one million times a day.Entry to the palace is managed such that about 125 people are allowed in every 15 minutes. But the queue gets so compressed at the front (5-6 people abreast) that you feel like you're never making progress.Once you get inside the palace, you scramble to join one of just three queues to buy tickets (1000 each, with a 150-ruble supplement if you want the audio guide), crossing paths with other ticket buyers, people exiting, and so forth.Then, once you've bought your ticket, you get in another queue (with people joining it from all sides) to get past the security guards and into the facility.Once you get past the security guards, there is another person managing flow into the exhibits. If you are not part of a tour group you can theoretically enter the exhibit area as you wish, but good luck to you in getting through those crowds!Then once you're among the exhibits (i.e., giant, elegantly furnished rooms with mostly unremarkable artwork on the walls -- except, as noted, the Amber Room), you will be managed for crowd control. But even then, they're not doing a very good job, as there were times when we were alone in a room and then times when we were jam-packed among other visitors.The audio guide, although recommended by Lonely Planet, was honestly WAY TOO WORDY, and it directed us to follow a route through the palace that was not allowed by the crowd managers. As for the wordiness, they should have taken a cue from the National Gallery in London: give a brief (60-second or less) overview and then invite listeners to punch in another number for further detail. Far too often, the most interesting parts of the audio exhibits came after three or four minutes of blather.We were so exhausted by the waiting, the scrums and the queues that we made it through everything in just 75 minutes.Here's what they should do: set up ticket booths outside the palace where you buy a timed ticket. That way, at least you can enjoy the grounds instead of just wasting time queuing.One thing I will say is that everyone was really very nice -- even the security guard who had to disappoint everybody by managing flow so tightly."

But having spent a good while learning the alphabet and some basic words, many people still chose not to understand and be awkward or rude, or amazingly lovely, so all I'm saying is, I tried, really hard.)Queue for a park ticket.Walk around the park a bit.Queue for the palace - For 3.5 hours if you're lucky.

Beg people behind to hold your place as you empty your bladder. It's been too long to give up now. I can do this.

Cafe closed after all that ordeal.I guess living in areas that support a massive tourism industry incredibly well spoils us. There really aren't that many people it deserves this big let down. There is no need for such an awful ordeal that can easily be prevented by a few simple things like signs. You would imagine at the pace of the queue that one person is inside at a time. No. They are being barged through by the next tour en masse. If you get to peep through a gap in the crowd, all good. It is beautiful and people will always visit. But having a bit of awareness of what you need to do will hopefully help. If you have a prescription for anything that can help you through it, make sure you dose up. Oh, and bring a lunch and a book, prepare for rain and sun and stuff like that. It is a nice place, it is worth a visit, but if you only have a day, probably best go Peterhof (we learnt to not bother with the palaces after this one - but the gardens are better) or somewhere else, as it will all be spent here and to not achieve very much."

There are vendor stalls there as well, which offer a variety of souvenirs in a relaxed setting (for after your tour).The palace tour is well organized. Bags must be checked at the entrance (restrooms nearby) but cameras are allowed everywhere (no flash) except the Amber room. Only a set number of people are let into each room at one time, so photography is possible and you can see elements unobstructed. Yet the groups move smoothly, with no waits.Of course the palace is overwhelmingly ornate and wondrous, including tables set for elegant suppers and walls covered in hand painted silk. One of the most interesting galleries was near the exit, where photos of the destroyed (during WWII) palace and of restoration work were displayed, with text placards in English. The grounds and grand outbuildings are not to be missed (gardens, bath house, lake, chapel). Take a traditional carriage ride around the grounds or a horse ride in the Alexander Park (from the Equestrian Center). Or a ferry ride on the lake. Enjoy them at leisure. We were lucky to hear an a cappella group sing in the Lakeside Music Hall, whose acoustics were tremendous.Several cafes are available on site, so make it a full and leisurely and beautiful day."

Her daughter, Empress Elizabeth in 1752 replaced it with a much grandiose Palace and completed it in 1756. The 1,066 feet long new Palace astonished her contemporaries. Elizabeth was a big spender: a lot of money, a lot. She used more than 220 pounds of gold just to decorate the Palace. There was a glamorous garden in front of the Palace. Catherine the Great did not edify it in a great deal, as she considered the Palace was a \u201cwhipped cream\u201d architecture. Nevertheless, people would still refer it as \u201cCatherine Palace\u201d. The Palace was \u201cabandoned\u201d after her death in 1796. The Germans during World War II intentionally destroyed the Palace. But soon after the War, reconstruction resumed and nearly completed in 2003. Much work still needs to be done. However, on the day we visited, the glory and lavishness of the Palace manifested itself everywhere. What a treasure!"

We also learned a secret that 5 pieces in the amber room are original but we won't give that info away - you'll just have to visit or research it. The ballroom with its gold leaf ornaments, ceiling murals and inlaid floor were somewhat gaudy but still impressive nonetheless. The furnaces used to heat the palace are all covered in Delft tiles imported from the Netherlands. The gardens feature a park-like setting behind the palace and contain several small buildings including the Little Hermitage which has a mechanical table that lifts from the 1st floor where servants set the table to the 2nd floor where Catherine and guests actually ate - somewhat over the top but innovative. It does get crowded in summer so I recommend going as early in the day as possible."

The building was badly damaged during WWII: parts, including the famed Amber Room, have been beautifully restored, whilst other areas are still undergoing restoration so there are relatively few rooms to visit.Even though we got their early as part of a tour group we did have to queue for a while: sensibly, the numbers entering at any one time are controlled so that there isn't horrendous crush inside (the Palace of Versailles in Paris should adopt the same approach as it has just become unbearable to visit). Once you enter you are moved along at a fairly rapid pace by the room attendants but it wasn't horrifically crowded and there was still time to take things in. Unlike in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, visitors move along the edges of rooms so that you can see the splendour of the building.I must confess I wasn't bowled over by the Amber Room and to an extent the extensive restoration does detract a bit from the experience although the grandeur and opulence of the original building has been brought back.I didn't have long to stay in the park which is to a broadly French design and what I saw was really quite delightful.You have to wear overshoes as you walk round and can't take in backpacks or large bags or indeed jackets - it is better to go prepared so you don't have to leave things in the cloakrooms."

To get to the palace we took the #2 subway line from Nevesky Proskpect to the third from the end line (airport bus connection) and caught the 575 bus located behind the statue of Lenin above ground to Pushkin. It was suprisingly easy to get there this way. Once there we had some trouble figuring out how to get in and which line...not many English speaking people and little sinage or direction.If you have an online ticket you have to go through the arch on the right of the building to a kiosk on the left beside the gate. The booth opens at noon. We exchanged our tickets and were motioned to go through this back gate...although we are pretty sure it was only for groups. We went anyway and blended in with other tourist groups. There was not an English tour so you go in the building and find a kiosk for an audio tour (150 R). I highly recommend this, especially for the minimal price. Once you have bought a ticket for the audio guide you take it to the information desk and they will give the handset to you with a 1000 deposit per. They directed us to another line to get booties on and we again blended into a group. I think we really had a great experience seeing the palace because we weren't with a group and went at our own pace. You still have to follow a Pre determined path but could take as long as we liked. However, I think we probably didn't follow the procedure as intended. This is due to a lack of direction and language barrier. The restored rooms are really lovely but are complete restorations as the palace was in shambles after the war. Many pieces of art and furnature were spared in an evacuation. The amber room is a work of art and worth the visit in itself. Amazing workmanship and cost to recreate it. The grounds and park are lovely as well. You could easily spend an entire day here. We wished we had packed a picnic lunch to enjoy in the park after the tour to avoid exorbent restaurant prices."

This palace is not as easy to get into as you must wait in a long line to purchase a ticket for the palace - after you purchase a ticket for the park (must pay for park first). The park is large and not all buildings are open so you get a view from the outside. The palace is limited in what you can see but restoration is an ongoing process. The only room where pictures are not allowed is the amber room and yet people still 'sneak' pictures. I enjoyed everything about the visit and was very happy to have a guide that waited in line (over 1.5 hours) to gain entrance into the palace."

Plenty of Wow moments.Photography is strictly forbidden in the Amber Room. The original Amber Room was, of course, looted by the Nazis \u2013 boxed up and shipped back to Germany and now lost to history. What is here now is a reproduction based on old photographs. If this is what the reproduction looks like, I can scarcely imagine how the original must have looked.This was the favourite home of the Russian Royal Family and it is easy to see why - quite possibly, the MOST beautiful building you will ever enter.There is a gift shop here that showcases amber like nowhere else, including an amber chess set."

The Summer Palace, or Catherine's Palace is in the town of Pushkin, which I believe is also called Tsarkoe Selo. It's 20 miles/45 mins by car south of the City. The baroque style building has been restored since WWII bombing and the rooms - especially the ballroom and the amber room, are stunning, with ornate flooring, troupe d'oeil ceiling paintings, mirrors and gold carvings giving a vision of amazing and spectacularly lavish balls in the time of Tsarist wealth and elitism. The gardens are pleasant if not spectacular. We caught the Catherine Palace a cappella singers in the morning pavilion and their short performance in those acoustics was superb - and free (though the CD I then bought was a bit costly, though I hope worthwhile).The big advice though is to go with a guide - not just for the detail of the history, but to dodge the queues! I hear they're less in winter, but in July they are huge - estimated at up to 3 hours - and it was hot when we went. Our guide was great and we side stepped all queues, and were able to enjoy the experience and take-in the history. The were lots of people there - 20,000 a day, allowed in batches of 100 - but that doesn't tarnish the experience as much as you might fear."

Why get in line and consider that others have come to see this too, when you can push, shove and man-handle others out of the way? There were some photography restrictions (very arbitrary it seemed to me) but most people accept this. So it is very frustrating when some of these ill behaved mobs try every dodge in the book to catch an illicit snap (mostly by impeding the progress of others by standing in doorways, technically outside the forbidden room). Gallery attendants were rather officious (equally arbitrary). The kind of over-crowding and poor manners seem like an accident waiting to happen."

No visitors were there other than about 60 of us, who first toured the Carriage Museum, seeing a variety of types of carriages. The one that Alexander II was using when he was assassinated was amazing to see, damage and all. Then we walked to the main hall, to the music of a welcoming band. Inside the palace was beautiful and varied. Elizabeth had this built and named it for her mother, Catherine (Peter the Great's 2nd wife.) Elizabeth loved the ornate style so her rooms are lavish and covered with gold. When Catherine the Great followed, she redid some rooms in the neoclassical style. Both are beautiful. Floor to ceiling, you will be awestruck. The gem of the palace is the Amber Room. Like much of the rest of the palace, it is a restoration as opposed to the original, but who cares! Stunningly beautiful. Pictures don't do it justice. We can hope that they recover the original walls that were stolen in the war, but in the meantime, don't miss this! Then we moved through rooms with musicians entertaining us and into a ballroom/hall where a string quartet played and 'recreators' danced for us. Finally, we moved to a side building that would have housed troops or perhaps help, but we saw the less decorated area of the complex. In all, it was a great evening. Even if you have to fight the normal crowds, you will love this!"

The issue is that they only allow precisely 100 people in per 15 minutes. Once you are in, expect anther 10-15 minute wait for the security check. It can be a bit claustrophic. Once you enter the stairs, be prepared for some slalom around groups if you travel by yourself. As in the Hermitage do not get intimated by groups and sometimes fight for your place.There is little time for walking around, because basically you are gently pushed from room to room by the staff. You are are allowed to take pictures everywhere, except for the Amber room.It is easy to get there by bus or bus and metro from the city. It takes you 1-2 hours depending on the route and where you are staying.The entry fee is 1000 roubles, but you need a ticket for the park first."

We got there in the morning (10am) on a bus and stood in line for a few mins to get tickets to the gardens. The tickets for the palace are bought seperately inside the gardens. Unfortunately the queue had already formed when we arrived and we would had to wait for an hour before they even opened. We never use tours, but in this case I would have used one to be able to skip the lines and get in. However a tour doesnt allow you time to see the whole gardens, like we did. There are many pavilions and statues spread throughout and it is all beautiful. This just gives me a good reason to go back to SP!"

We could hear it fine. Lol. It's a bit of a trek outside of st Petersburg. We took the metro to Kupichina then got a private minibus type taxi there. So cost is less than 100 rub to get there.

            "review": "A little hard to enjoy when it's overcrowded. Catherine Palace is located in the town of Pushkin, located outside of St. Petersburg, about an hour\u2019s drive away. The town is sometimes also referred to as Tsarkoye Selo in some guidebooks (in case anyone is confused like I was initially). Anyway, we visited Catherine Palace only to see the opulent but otherwise masterfully restored Amber Room of course. Before you enter, the usual security checks apply and no water is allowed inside (not even bottled water). They will usually request that you leave your outer jackets at the cloak room too, especially if you\u2019re wearing the thick, heavy-set-looking ones; light jackets are permitted. I suggest just placing your jackets inside the cloakroom in any case; imagine queuing all the way to the security checkpoint (queues are never short by the way) only to be told that you can\u2019t go further because of the jacket issue\u2026 The entrance is pretty congested with lots of people queueing for the toilets and lots of people trying to store/retrieve their stuff at the cloakroom so be prepared for chaos. The interior of the palace is really beautiful and photography of the palace interior is permitted everywhere except for the Amber Room. I toured the palace in a big group of 30 and we were constantly shooed along by the matronly custodians in every room, and our guide had to talk really fast, so the entire tour felt rushed. Can\u2019t really blame the custodians either, since there were simply too many tourists packed inside the palace and they had to keep ushering groups along to prevent congestion. Don\u2019t expect you\u2019ll have the luxury of time to take in the beauty of the Amber Room. If possible, I suggest touring the palace interior in a small group (maybe 2-3 people at most); the smaller groups might have a wee bit more leeway with the custodians."

As you walk around the inside of the palace you travel from one opulent room to another opulent room. What makes it even more amazing is that the silks on the walls and the inlaid wooden floors as well as other parts of the palace have been restored using the original techniques. It is as if it was never damaged during the war.The Amber Room is beautiful, but unlike the rest of the palace you cannot take photos in there. The grounds it stands in are also lovely with the kitchen buildings (you wouldn't know that they are kitchens unless you are told) standing apart from palace.It does get busy and some of the other guides try to push other guides along so theycan their group in a better spot."

But the massive numbers of tourists visiting this rather small castle with very narrow corridors makes it an agonizing place to visit. Expect a queue for two hours with guided groups just randomly gate crashing the queue somewhere in the middle.Furthermore, when inside of the castle, a massive effort in making the guided tourists occupy just one side of the corridors since it is almost impossible to get around as a single person or as a couple without a guide. This place has massive potential, but I would strongly recommend anyone to keep their distance during summer."

Unfortunately, this did not result in less visitors. We arrived relatively early in the day, but were still forced to wait in a lengthy line outside before entering for about 30 minutes in the rain, but were lucky because groups behind us waited 1-2 hours in line in the rain before they got in. They seem to only allow so many people in at a time, but it wasn't really consistent. There is a free forced coat/umbrella check area near the entrance and also a reasonably sized free restroom area. I forget how many rooms you get to visit, but its not many in comparison to the total number in the palace, however, it is enough to get a feel for what it was like for those who stayed there. It was well worth being on an organized tour with a guide in Catherine's Palace. The tour moves a quick pace with pretty much one group allowed in each room at a time. No photos of any kind are allowed in the amber room, but you could easily take photos of it from the adjacent rooms. They've done a nice job restoring this palace over the years. Its got all of the glitz and gold that you might expect."

Catherine's Palace was constructed in the 18th century and it surprises me that it only took four years to build according to Wikipedia. Obviously in those days you just needed money and the right architects and builders. Planning permission didn't come into it.Considering the crowds entry was remarkably quick and, once inside, you are kept moving at quite a pace. Over 200 pounds of gold are used inside and out for decoration and this metal is beautifully displayed behind clear protective panels.Of parallel interest are the gardens and fountains outside. Not as glitzy as the fountains at the Bellagio hotel, Las Vegas, but then, I don't think that would be in keeping.There's a large area to visit and we couldn't cover everything we wanted to see in the time available. Lunch was a hastily consumed ice cream on the hoof.This probably could be classified as one of the wonders of the modern world and certainly enhanced our visit to Russia."

On the early summer Sunday when I toured, if anything, the area close to the palace was as full of tourists as the Hermitage had been. Of course, the groups of visitors were more spread out here. The main palace (the famous blue and white structure) was commissioned by Catherine I, whose taste ran to Baroque. Catherine the Great, who favored Neoclassical architecture, added a columned pavilion as a wing that balanced the gold-domed imperial church at the other end. Alongside the pavilion was a lovely flower garden, abloom with fragrant roses, for which the blue lupines and yellow and orange marigolds acted as foils. Both Catherines, as well as Elizabeth, had scattered follies and other comparatively small buildings around the grounds, including a performance space for small orchestras and chamber groups. It had three rooms and extraordinary acoustics. A statue of the Enlightenment tsarina, looking grand indeed, dominated the central room. Across the pretty little lake was the Turkish Bath, reportedly built by Catherine the Great to look like a mosque, in celebration of a victory over the Turks.We had been unable to secure tickets to the palace interior, and at any rate, the lines were long, suggesting that the rooms would be packed. However, there was a shop tucked into the ground floor of the palace displaying and selling amber mosaics, jewelry, even tea cups created by the artisans who had created the replicas of the original amber panels used to restore the Amber Room. (The originals were looted during the Nazi occupation, and their location is still unknown.)"

After spending a whole day on our own at Peterhof, we decided to get a guided tour for Pushkin, however we had left it too late for a private guide and we had to settle for a bus tour, at least it was less than half the price of a private tour. We were told to arrive to pay for the tour with our booking voucher 20mins before time. At this stage it was going to be a minibus tour. By the time it came to 1400 they had sold more tickets and it had turned into a bus tour after all. Luckily my husband had gone to check, when the minibus had not arrived by 1400. Other people were also confused and a number of Russians were taken off the bus as it was to be a tour with an English speaking guide.We were given those headsets and a small box to pick up the voice of our guide. I had the feeling that she did not do this regularly as she spent the whole time anxiously trying to keep track of her flock! We arrived at one point where she had forgotten or not understood to get something for us to be allowed in, it was no wonder that we had trouble fathoming out what we had to do at Peterhof.Once in the grounds there were different routes for the groups to take but we all landed up queueing in a big hall until it was our groups turn to go round.We were allowed to take non flash pictures except in the amber room, although someone I spoke to later said that they had not been allowed to take any pictures!! The rooms were certainly magnificent, but of course once again you were not able to linger if you wished. The amber room was not particularly to my taste, OTT but its restoration after being destroyed in the war was amazing.There was not a lot of time left to visit the gardens, but we did a short tour and then started making our way back to the bus through a street market.I rate the attraction itself as excellent, but because of the crowds and queues the overall experience falls short of this."

The problem with all the main sights in St Petersburg is the volume of tourists trying to get access to view the beautifully restored buildings. Queues are long and many rooms in the various palaces cannot be seen to full effect because they are so full of people.Huge sums have been spent restoring (beautifully) the rooms, complete with pure gold leaf applied to the ornate columns, friezes and decorations.We visited during a two day cruise ship stop and had booked a small group tour with a local company. But even with local knowledge, early access and a small group it was a struggle to see all we wanted.For a decent chance to properly appreciate everything here, it would be necessary to make an independent visit to St Petersburg outside the cruise ship period and allocate much more time to enjoy this amazing palace. A guide is needed \u2013 if travelling independently it would be worth checking if an audio guide is available - it would be a huge advantage to visit at a slower pace. The souvenir shops looked good, with an interesting selection of appropriately local souvenirs \u2013 similar shops were at most attractions and also at the cruise ship terminal and prices appeared to be much the same everywhere."

The Palace has mostly been restored since the German Nazis devastated the Palace and Park in WWII. I think they are still working on restoring the inside of the Palace chapel. In 1711, a large-scale residence began to be built on this site for Catherine I, Peter the Great's wife and later sovereign. Catherine I bequeathed the palace and grounds to her daughter, Elizabeth Petrovna who became the Empress in 1741. She spent a fortune turning the place into a luxurious palace and grounds. The Empress Catherine the Great continued the work to make the palace a palace to behold. There are several aspects of the Palace that are memorable. The white marble Main Staircase is magnificence itself. The double windows provide natural light. The molded ornamentation on the walls, the ceiling paintings by Italians, pieces of marble sculpture on the landings, the vases and the beautiful wall clock make this staircase most impressive. The Great Ballroom is overwhelming with extensive amount of gold gilding in the ornamentation with mirrors on the walls between large glass doors with large glass windows above the doors on two sides of the Ballroom. The inlaid parquet wood floor with star-shaped diverging rays was restored based on the original architect's sketch and made from Russian wood, oak, maple and walnut. It is simply stunning. The hall is heated with furnaces behind the mirrors. The three paintings comprising the ceiling are the Triumph of Russia. It is clearly a place for grand balls. There are three anterooms containing lots of gold gilded carving and ornamentation. The Arabesque Hall (completed 1784) is one of the impressive rooms in the private apartments of Catherine the Great. It has a white, blue and gold color scheme. Next to the ballroom is a dining room with more gold decor, numerous mirrors, and paintings in the ceiling of Greek mythology. There is a long walkway through several rooms with doors covered with gold gilded carvings. The doors are aligned and give the impression of a very long hallway of gold. There are various drawing rooms, dining rooms and a portrait room containing portraits of Empress Elizabeth and Empress Catherine the Great.  One of the most interesting rooms is the Amber Room, considered by some a one of the great treasures of the world, but seems just gaudy to me. The room was produced in 1701-09 with inlaid amber panels sent in 1717 by the Prussian king, Frederick William I, to Peter the Great for the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg and eventually installed in Catherine's Palace. During WWII the room was dismantled by the Nazis and sent to Germany where it disappeared. This reconstruction is reputed to cost $12 million. There is a Green Dining room with green walls decorated with white plaster statues of Romans. It is elegant without all the gold gilt which quickly becomes tedious. Exiting the Palace into Catherine Park is truly calming and pleasant because the park is so green, nicely laid out, understated but elegant in its own way. There are lovely white marble statues throughout the park, shaded walkways, beautiful buildings (including the Cameron Gallery), impressive stairways, a pergola, and a large lake with buildings at various places around the lake. It was lovely to stroll around the park and the lake. Catherine's palace and park are located just a short distance from St. Petersburg but it is clearly a must-see to any visit to St. Petersburg."

It is one of the most beautiful palaces we have ever seen and our guide was able to give us a lot of detail and interesting stories on the palace and Catherine. I don't think I would enjoy it if I had to wait in a long line to get in and then be in a group instead of just the two of us. Yes, it was expensive but some things are worth paying for."

We decided instead to take in only the park. This alone took the whole afternoon. There are many different buildings to look at. The Turkish Bath has it's own little audio tour which was fascinating! Otherwise, the park guide (free folder with admission) contains a small paragraph about each of the buildings. We also overheard a private tour guide in the garden. The kinds of stories he was telling literally brought history alive. If we were to do it again, we would sign up for one of those guides."

Reached at 12PM today and queued for about three hours - 45 mins for the entrance tickets to the Park and then another longer queue in front of Catherine Palace (tickets to Catherine Palace are to be bought inside the Palace). The reasons for such horrendous long waiting hours are other than its popularity, there are many paid persons helping tour groups to queue, so the queue is actually longer than it looks, as each \"queuer\" will become a group of 30 or more visitors in front of you. My suggestion to individual visitors is probably do the park first, as the queue to Catherine Palace shortens by more than half at about 5PM (plus by that time, the tour groups would have left). Be sure to check the opening hours first. The Palace opens till 8PM on the day I visit (20June2016). My second suggestion is to take the mini buses directly from metro stations to the Park instead of suburban train (both means are listed in Catherine Palace official website), because the suburban train from Vitebsky railway station to Pushkin railway station runs at about 1-hour interval, less frequent than mini buses."

Catherine Palace is clearly the better of the two. OK, Picture taking is OK. No hydrofoil ride but that's over-rated and that staff is hostile to tourists. It is an hour drive by car to CP. You'll need almost two hours inside after an hour or more in line. In travel season, the lines are huge. Seems like they stretch to Moscow. And if there are e-tickets, there will be a LONG/SLOW line to exchange them for real tickets.My suggestion is to hire a private tour company in St.P to take you to, into and through CP. Yes, this is much more expensive than doing it on your own though beyond the cost of admission will be the travel. With a private tour company, you will be picket up at your hotel, taken there, and probably will not wait in any line. They have their methods. And they know where to find food and the WC with the shortest line. We used Kremlin Tour (bad name as they operate in St.P and do much more than just the K). Yes, they are more expensive than do-it-yourself. But worth the difference many times over. Plus a good English-speaking guide with good knowledge of the place. If a private tour is not in your budget, I seriously suggest you consider saving for another year so it is in your budget. It will be worth it."

The Catherine Palace is an amazing gingerbread building with magnificent gardens, exteriors and interiors and you could just walk through it an enjoy it, but you will gain so much more from doing some advance homework or taking a tour. Not only will it help accessing the site (queues can be long and they do try to move you through with military precision) but you really need the information....to understand the history, the destruction, the rebuilding...to appreciate what you are seeing. The State rooms and the porcelain are so impressive, the ceiling frescoes, the Great Hall, well, you need context and background to appreciate it. And there is no way to fully appreciate the rebuilt Amber Room without a knowledge of the history (and ongoing mystery) of the original room. It is a jewel and most definitely worth putting time into learning about it so you can appreciate it. At the very least Google it while you're on your way there!"

It is very busy and the queue to get tickets and enter if you go independently is huge. There also aren't many signs or descriptions in English so you will gain a lot from a tour guide. This is the only site I did as a trip and I'm relieved I did that. Much like Peterhof, you have to pay for each building in the gardens which can add up. Not all of the palace is open to the public as it is still being restored after the German's virtually destroyed it during WWII. The Amber Room has been restored and recreated and it is amazing. The Agate Room is still closed. You need several hours to fully explore the palace, grounds and Pushkin, and the crowds slow you down considerably. This is definitely worth the hours trip outside of the city."

It is worth the time to see the details in the building and to understand what life was like at that time. You do have to put these cloth shoe covers over your shoes to walk in the palace. The surrounding gardens are also quite impressive and beautiful to stroll around on a sunny day. Again, there is a lot of walking and there are stairs so if you are traveling with older visitors, keep that in mind.

If you can go in NOT on a tour, but as individuals (we went with an individual guide we had for the day) you will have a nicer experience, as the big groups - like golfers on a crowded day, I suppose - have to keep the groups moving along at a pretty rapid clip to keep from holding each other up. We'd get the rooms to ourselves for a few minutes between groups. Allow some time to walk the grounds if it is not raining.

The palace is quite large so be prepared to walk."

It came up in conversation with a travelling cousin (Ron) many years earlier and its history intrigued us. We were not disappointed though we knew it was a replica, as the Nazis had done their nasty business there in WW 2. The grandeur of the place and the immaculate condition of the gardens and walkways made it a fantastic outing though it was a little gray (perhaps even more fitting!). A great daytrip from St Petersburg and worth the hour drive. You actually get the cross the frontlines which is historic in itself."

I visited in early May 2016, catching a train from Vitebsky railway station in central St Petersburg - not the main station but the local station down the right hand side of the main station. The station needed for Catherine Palace is Tsarkoe Selo and any train going to Pavlovsk stops there. The route map shows eight stations from Vitebsky but the train doesn't seem to stop at all of them. The prior station is the distinctively named Kilometre 21. The Palace is walkable from the station - about a mile - but I was able to catch bus no.370 from outside the station. Unfortunately I couldn't work out the right bus to take back on leaving the Palace so ended up walking. The Palace is a 'must' visit. Individual tickets for the grounds are available at the entrance kiosks. For individuals - as opposed to groups - tickets for the Palace are purchased inside the Palace but individuals are not let in to purchase these until noon. The queue starts forming shortly after 10am."

The actual Palace was outstanding and so opulent you could understand the origins of some of the conflict in Russian history. Whilst not quite all restored the accommodation open to the public is awesome and the history behind it and use of the rooms by the likes of Catherine the Great and her husband Peter the Great so interesting. Tina was able to guide us through the history of nearly every piece of furniture which we found fascinating. After the Palace tour we took a leisurely walk around the gardens and in their bleak form given the time of year, still beautiful. The main lake and it's buildings on a clam bright Spring day were spellbinding. A real must if you are St Petersburg."

Many of the interior rooms are just exquisite, particularly the famous amber room.Most people combine this, in summer time at least, with Peterhof and its fabulous fountains.

Go to Moscovskaya station, exit and follow the signs for the 545 or the 342 Minibus. It's NOT the stop right at the exit.

We booked online for this, but we didn't get tickets - we got vouchers to exchange for tickets which we did at the information booth. This was pointless, we should have just bought tickets there as there were no queues when we arrived at 1100. To get an audio guide in English you need to buy a ticket for it at the ticket booth then go to the administration booth with your ticket to pick it up. You do not go through security then pick it up - as you do for the Russian ones. After we saw the Palace we went for a walk around the grounds. It's probably more impressive I summer but was still very nice. For lunch we went somewhere just outside called BakenBards. It was upstairs nearby and had free wifi. The cafe inside Catherine Palace did not look very appetising. To get back we caught the 545 bus in a slightly different place to where we had been dropped off, kind of around the corner. I imagine the Palace gets very busy in the height of summer, but there weren't too many tourists to enjoy it when we went."

The ornate blue building is around a thousand feet long ( 300 metres) Gold domes rise over the chapel.A guided tour takes you through many magnificent rooms including the famous Picture Gallery, the Amber Room, and The Great Hall. The hall is the largest room. The palace is remarkable for its fairy tale interior and fine furniture. The grounds of the palace extend to fifteen hundred acres of landscaped gardens, parkland and pavilions."

It was an expense which paid off in many ways, and one was visiting the Palaces and Museums. We were able to bypass the lines completely, and since our guide was very familiar with the staff @ each venue, we were given some small privileges larger groups were not. With that said, the Palace was stunning beyond words. The attention to detail in each room was flawless. The fireplaces each had their own character despite the similarity of design. Do not miss the Amber room. It is an astonishing display of opulence. It is an experience I will never forget; to see walls covered in every shade of amber imaginable. Each room offers a unique display and style. The gardens are not to be missed. The design of each is unique and worth the wander. Do not let lines or crowds dissuade you, it is a rare opportunity to experience such an amazing venue."

I traveled in mid March so there were very, very few tourists; basically empty at both the Catherine Palace and Pavlovsk Palace. My tour guide, Irina Kazantseva, was absolutely wonderful. She was extremely knowledgable; described in detail the histories and intricacies of the settings and added a great deal of personal history about the palace's occupants. Catherine Palace is quite stunning; glistening gold interiors and mirrors. Pavlovsk Palace is more refined and filled with beautiful works of art. You miss out on the gardens in winter but gain in no hordes of people. There is also an excellent gift shop nearby where you can purchase high quality, Russian handicrafts. The tour was booked through Viator...highly recommended! Also, Thank you to Irina; excellent guide!"

We had a first rate private tour guide. The history is magnificent, and yes the place is impressive at first glance\u2026 but don\u2019t look too closely. Built by Peter the Great\u2019s wife Catherine, made grander by their daughter Empress Elizabeth, and then Catherine the Great, and so on\u2026 I get that the property was damaged during WWII and greatly restored\u2026 as were many properties. Catherine\u2019s Palace was probably beautifully restored at one time, but it would seem that limited monies are spent on maintaining the property or housekeeping. As one of the more visited properties in the St. Petersburg area, it seems like tourist monies are not reinvested back into this incredible landmark IMHO."

Our guide was able to give us fantastic insight into the palace, it's history and it's inhabitants - as well as telling us how you can rent out the grand hall for special occasions!! New life goal there I think.The Palace is everything you expect it to be, with floor to ceiling gold and intricate decor. The Amber Room is also one-of-a-kind which is still surrounded in mystery. A must see when in St Petersburg.We also got to stop at the Church near Pushkin that the Romanov family had built. This was very special (and empty), as well as the derelict armory and stables which have yet to make the renovation process of the Catherine Palace. All very extraordinary."

Behind the majestic iron and gold gates you will find the blue facade of the massive palace. The advantage of a winter visit is the lack of crowds. As we toured the rooms we were occasionally by ourselves and had plenty of time to gaze in awe at the detailed beauty of the rooms and decor. You could almost envision a ball in the ballroom and feasts in the other rooms. The amber Room is splendid and the restoration throughout beautifully done. We were able to walk the outdoor trails and get a sense of the beauty of the park in warmer seasons. So much history to learn, wonderful to see it firsthand."

The palace was therefore busier than a usual for an out of season visit BUT still with a little care and guided movement around we were able to have a magnificent trip back into the past.The conservation work on this palace is spectacular WELL done Russia Although some people might say it is over restored the fact that this magnificent building has been put back into good order is a credit to all involved.The gold leaf is outstanding as well as the floors and paintings The Catherine The Greats wing was all under wraps for restoration but the Baroque wings of the Palace were all on show.Try to get there first thing or late afternoon to avoid the main rush of midday tour buses A guide pre booked from St Petresburg would be a great investment as you need to get transport there and if visiting other palaces in the area that day then this becomes good value.Also he/she will know which queues to jump and the best routes to take to miss the crowdsUnfortunately due to the low temperatures outside the bground only got a fleeting visit from us but the midwinter scenes were wonderful and the palace was outstanding.Avioid the shops,a little tacky ,and the cafe was not the best.Not to be missed though,even if the amber room was all a replacement!!!

Catherine Palace itself is very interesting and definitely well worth a visit. The gardens are vast and incredibly beautiful. It was -20 degrees when we were there and despite the cold it was a magical atmosphere, everything covered in snow, the trees shining like silver in the sun, truly peaceful in a beautiful setting. Next to Catherine Palace is Alexander Palace (the main residence of the last tsar and his family), much smaller but also set in beautiful gardens. Unfortunately it was closed at this time of year. Even if you have a few days in St Petersburg I think it is well worth setting aside a day to visit Tsarskoe Selo."

The summer palace is about 45 minutes drive from the downtown city precinct and it's best to get there just on opening time (10am in winter) before the crowds of tourists start to arrive. Even though it was low season on the date we visited, there were large tour groups starting to crowd the rooms so it could be bedlam in spring and summer.The palace is very long but not particularly wide, with a corridor running the length on either side, and opening alternatively into single rooms, and then a series of grand ballrooms.The palace was badly damaged during WW2 and the restoration work has been done to a very high standard such that it is very difficult to detect the replacement from the original.Get a guide to obtain the best from your visit as the history behind the palace, it's rooms and inhabitants over the centuries is fascinating.The grand ballroom alone has 11kg of gold leaf applied to the columns and relief decorations.The gardens are basically closed during winter although you are free to wander the grounds. The majority of the thousands of marble ornaments in the gardens are boxed in situ to protect them from the winter ravages.Don't miss this during a visit to St Petersburg"

If you travel, as I do, to see impressive sights and have special days out, then a wander through the mirrored and gilded rooms and corridors will certainly give full value. The amber room is worth the entrance fee alone. After your eyes have been sparkled and swirled the calm simple but delightful gardens are a blessing.

The tour was in Russian, so it's better if you understand Russian, but they also offer tours in other languages or you can drive directly to the palace. The palace and gardens are just amazing. Even though there were a lot of people (especially inside), you still got a good look at the impressive art and luxury of those times. Especially, also considering that most of the art had to be significantly restored after it got damaged/destroyed or buried during the war.

Originally built in 1717 by Catherine I, it changed various architects until 1756 when architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli showed all his talent creating the 325 m. long new Palace, using 100 kgs of gold for its decoration. The edifice was pulled down 6 times and built again until Catherine the Great called the Scottish architect Charles Cameron who turned many rooms to Neoclassical style.The Palace was completely destroyed by the Nazis during WWII. Fortunately some Soviet archivists had copied most of the interior and the reconstruction was based on their documents. The marble staircase (1860 by Hippolyto Monighetti) impresses the visitor with its rocaille style. The Great Hall is part of the Golden Enfilade rooms. It amazes everyone with its 860 sq.m., the various windows with mirrors and the exceptional decoration carved by 130 masters. On the ceiling the Triumph of Russia by Giouseppe Valeriani in 1753.The Amber Room is the Palace's highlight. No words can describe the colours and the details of this masterpiece. It's an exact copy of the original that disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The restoration lasted 24 years and 5.7 tonnes of raw material were used by expert Russian stone-cutters. We were very lucky to enjoy its uniqueness for 15 minutes and take photos too, in the evening, when the Palace is closed for the public. I mention this because visitors during the day opening times, are forced to walk very quickly in the Amber Room without being able to enjoy anything and without taking any photos. So, please try to find the best way for you to visit this unbelievable jewel. We enjoyed also a reception and ballet in the garden and period dancing in the Grand Hall. Unforgettable evening that ended in the restaurant with a great dinner, folklore songs and balalaika and accord\u00e9on music."

Inside you will find both baroque and classical style of interior design. There is one room that is so golden that you feel almost blind from the glare lol ...The park is equally beautiful and BIG. I visited during autumn so I enjoy the green, yellow and red leaves through out. Wear good walking shoes if you plan to visit it. And keep yourself warm - the wind can be quite strong in some part of the park.Food: the palace has a cafe. Food is of at standard quality but price is more expensive than outside."

Anyone visiting St. Petersburg for even a few days should seriously consider making the 20 mile side trip to Pushkin to visit Catherine Palace and its grounds. The palace and grounds are spectacular and arguably rival those of France's Palace of Versailles. In addition, the palace is a kind of historical testament to 18th century czarist extravagance and the \"income inequality\" that existed in Russia in that age. It is important to remember that the original palace was destroyed by the German army in World War II, so tourists see a recreation built by the Russian government. The rebuilt palace includes a copy of the original palace's \"Amber Room,\" which is seemingly unique among European palaces, and which by itself makes the trip to Catherine Palace worth it. The palace also features wonderful parquet wood floors, and the caretakers of the palace require visitors to don plastic shoe covers to visit the palace's interior, something for which a visitor should be prepared."

Make note that if you use Google maps to plan your journey here, the bus number which gets you there from the metro has changed its number from 186 to 286 - the bus stop numbers haven't caught up yet either, so you are still looking out for both, when making your way home afterwards. This is a beautiful estate, not as glitzy and pompous as Petergof, which made me like it more, but that's just personal taste. The staff who work at the palace are also a lot more polite and helpful than at Petergoff, and we were thus advised on how to spend out time at the estate to our best advantage. We hired a guide upon our arrival for ten pounds - she did not speak English, but as a Russian speaker myself, I enjoyed her little tour, which lasted us until the time of palace admission. The palace tour takes 20 minutes, and you are lead around by a palace guide who uses a short-distance radio set to make sure everyone hears well. Important to note - headsets for foreigners cost an extra 150 roubles and have to be purchased at the cashier desk number 5 BEFORE you go through to the room where everyone else gets their headsets. Make sure you dedicate a full day to the palace, as the extensive grounds deserve a lot of time on their own. There are very tame red squirrels living on the estate, so if you bring some squirrel-friendly food with you on the trip, you can possible capture some great nature shots. A fairly inexpensive golf buggy (about 5 pounds) ride around the estate can ensure you cover more ground if you are short on time or can't walk for whatever reason), which means you will see various architectural and landscaping features of the park. As a foreigner, I would probably try and book a tour from the city as this would make travelling and information-gathering a lot easier."

When we get inside we have to get in line a little bit to enter and when we get inside we have to get in line again ( this line include everyone that booked ticket in advance or buy ticket that day or group tour) so about 30 mins in line and we are in.

I visited Peterhof Palace about 5 years ago and very impressed with those beautiful fountains. Looking the exterior of Catherine Palace, it is about half a mile long, very difficult to capuche into one picture from one end to other. The luxurious interiors are something unique and different from Peterhof Palace. The Great Hall, as \u201cHall of Light\u201d is gold everywhere, occupying the full width of the palace. The Amber Room was dismantled by German troops in 1941, and rebuilt through many years hard work based on black and white photographs. Portrait Hall is covered with fine printings to every inch of wall space. The garden is large; most visitors only walk through to the lake side, not go through each building around it. It was a great visit"

The palace is splendid beyond belief and was the residence of Catherine the First and then rebuilt by her daughter Emress Elizabeth in 1756 who very much loved the Rococo style. The light, mirrors and furnishings are simply something to see and the beautiful porcelain stoves in many rooms are beautiful. Later Catherine the Great lived there and preferred a more subtle style and covered much of the decoration. It is the home of the fabled Amber Room where NO photos are permitted. During the war the Nazi destruction was devastating, but truly skilled and gifted restoration people did a magnificent job that is hard to believe when you see the photos of the damage done in World War II. The palace grounds and outbuildings are beautiful and a delight to see."

Most of the tour is on the first floor and as its a long narrow building this means you have very little stairs to climb. This is very like the Palace of Versailles, with lots of red and gold. For anyone interested in interior design or just for the wow factor, its well worth a visit. I recommend not to miss the Amber Room which has been fully restored and only completed in 2003. The various shades of amber used to create the room is amazing. There are quite good reference books available in the shop at reasonable prices. The cost of other little souvenir items are very expensive though compared to regular shops. I would suggest you get these elsewhere. The ladies who are monitoring the rooms are quite stern and unapproachable but this does not impact too much on the visit. We had a registered guide with us and she still got told off for being too slow through the rooms. You must leave heavy jackets in the cloakroom and you are not allowed carry bottles of water. Once you know this in advance, you can dress accordingly as its quite warm inside."

The first was part of a bigger tour and the palace and grounds out in the suburbs are impressive. We went upstairs and visited 5-6 rooms plus the throne room . It was vacation time (July) and crowded . We spent 1/2 hour in the throne room waiting to exit in a crowded, hot room (with window air conditioning). Nice but not a great experience due to the crowd.But we visited the next night as part of a special tour \"Evening with the Tsars\" of about 60 people (guests) at a leisurely pace through the carriage Museum, 12 rooms-some with live music. We entered the throne room and picked up champagne and listened to a short concert. Then The \"Tsar and Tsarina\" came in after which a couple did two period dances. We then left and were greeted by a military band outside with a coach and horses bringing in 2 special guests who waltzed. After this we were lead to a restaurant on the grounds and had a very nice 4 course meal with Vodka and a Russian band playing all types of music with high energy and customer interaction. This was our top treat of the cruise, but expensive.Either way Catherine's palace is worth seeing but choose a cooler day or a non vacation day if in a big group."

What a spectacular palace this is, we took a tour trip out of St Petersburg via a coach, we were in the city with a P&O cruise of the Baltic.It's about a 45 minute journey, depending on the traffic in the city, and you MUST get there early, or the queues and the crowds are horrendous, we left the city at 07.30, and it opens at 08.30, but we were in the first 100 or so waiting to get in, by 08.30 I expect another 7 or 8 coaches had arrived, and the queues were already starting to become big.Once inside, you cannot believe the opulence of the decor and fixtures and fittings, it must be one of the top 5 palaces in the world, and so perfectly restored by the USSR at the time.You have to see the pictures of how it was left after the world war 2, the Palace was almost totally destroyed, it's the point where he Germans got to and besieged the city, because it sits on higher ground, it became the artillery site against the city, and was treated very badly.To see it today, you wouldn't believe it had sustained so much damage and abuse, it feels like the royal family still lives inside, and the amber room is the only one of its kind in the world I think, truly magnificent.Without doubt this is a must see site if your visiting st Petersburg, it will always be a memory that you will never see again."

She is very knowledgably in history of Russia as art history as well. We appreciated her faultless English. Thanks to her we have seen all point of interest in Tsarsko Selo during day and the most popular point of St.Petersburg in the afternoon. Our journey from St.Petersburg to Pushkin was an adventure we will never forget. Amazing Amber Room in Catherine\u2019s Palace we will remember forever and also the huge park with number of buildings in the Park such as Camron Gallery, Hermitage Pavilion, Creaking Pavilion,\u2026 . One pavilion had a special acoustic. There was a concert of male sextet. That was something special. Like there were 50 singers and not only 5. They were singing Russians songs. One was about Neva river\u2026. We also saw statue Girl with a Pitcher, Pushkin\u2019s statue, Church of the Sign,Lycee, Alexsander Palace,\u2026Nastya is very well organized and got us through lineups without any delay. She also chose interesting and inexpensive local restaurant in Pushkin for a lunch and we had a nice break. There we had a lovely time and tasted great local food as Borsch and super Cake with Honey. We tried local drinks: kvas and Cranbery juice which we liked very much. It was a perfect day. Thanks to Nastya we have seen all that in only one day tour. Antonela"

The wealth and the power of the Russian Royalty is very evident in everything you see here \u2013 huge glided rooms, painted ceilings, imported silk wallpaper, awesome period furniture, and china from all over the world, -- and so much more.The wood floors inside are amazing. They are spectacularly designed, and superbly maintained. All visitors have to wear booties to preserve them.The fully restored \u201cAmber Room\u201d was opulent, spectacular, unbelievable and unique. No photos are allowed in this room. The guards are very particular and strict about this.The Palace is over 1000 feet long. The facade has tons and tons of gold gilding. The grandeur is simply staggeringThe Gardens are amazing and lovely. Everything is manicured, symmetrical, and color coordinated.There is a lot of walking involved in the long corridors, and up and down the stairs. So come prepared for that. Our guided tour kept up the pace, otherwise we would have been stuck in those crowds, or stayed there simply gawking.The Palace completely lived up to our expectations from what we had read about it. We were just not prepared for the sensory overload. It was one of the most beautiful and unique Palaces we have seen.Definitely a \u201cMust Visit\u201d place."

What makes this gorgeous palace special, beyond the incredible decor, art, and furnishings, is the fact that this place was basically taken apart piece by piece and reconstructed following being decimated during the war. The building itself was nearly demolished by the Germans, but the Russians had the forethought to remove most of the important artifacts in advance of the siege and shipped them to Siberia for safe keeping. Following the war, the building itself and the contents were redone to exact, pre-war specifications, using original plans and photographs. They did an amazing job. The process is shown on some well-done displays, with photographs of the palace before, during, and after reconstruction. What they managed to accomplish is truly incredible.Inside and out, this place is awesome and well worth a visit. I know it's easy to get palace and museum fatigue in Europe, but the story behind this one makes it different. Besides, the Amber Room is really one of a kind and worth the price of admission. Give yourself a couple of hours to see things without being rushed."

What we see today as Catherine Palace is the product of several 18th century reconstructions reflecting the varying tastes of empresses - from Catherine I to Elizabeth to Catherine II! The result, ultimately, is more of the same of what we saw at the Hermitage & Petergof, Italian elegance, unrestrained extravagant luxury & over-ornate decoration, but it is every bit as magnificent as those other Romanov palaces - probably more so. The quadrangle-shaped building has many unbelievably beautiful rooms & gold encrusted apartments, the Picture Hall, the Amber Chamber, the Green Dining Room, & so on. Again the interior recollects the majesty of Versailles, especially with its similarity to the Hall of Mirrors. The manicured parks are equally as fascinating as those at the Summer Palace, with their expansive relaxing areas, gardens, lakes & canals, unusual hedge patterns, etc. The Cameron Galleries with its bronze busts of famous historical figures & other sculptures is not to be missed either. In one of the lakeside buildings we heard an excellent performance of \"the Volga Boatman\" from a vocal quartet. The only disappointment at the Tsarskoye Selo palace was the limited lunch options on site, the relatively new pectopaH was booked out on the day we visited, & we had a long wait for service at the other food outlet."

We visited here recently, via a tour, in large part because our time was limited and it was easier than figuring out the transportation to and from the city. The palace was indeed as impressive as expected with many beautiful rooms. Our guide (from City Tours) was very good and I particularly enjoyed the information about how different members of the royal family approached the decor of the palace. Learning about the restoration post WWII was also very interesting. The grounds were also lovely. I would try to visit if you can squeeze this in. I believe the tour saved time."

What is so amazing about this palace is the fact it was destroyed by the Germans in WWII, but has been painstakingly restored to it's former self in such a way you would never know.Gold everywhere, silk wallpaper, and of course there is The Amber Room which is truly amazing.The gardens are beautiful and we were treated to a small but delightful recital from 5 male singers in one of the buildings. I was so impressed I bought one of the CDs.Very busy with lots of queues (which we managed to avoid), and I would also strongly suggest a guide or tour to fully appreciate the history of this place."

A visit to Catherine\"s is not only a tribute to those who built the Palace originally but also to those who first did everything to save it before the German occupation and then to those who restored it. Absolutely stunning place. . The comfortable way to reach Pushkin is by train from Vibetsky Railway station (adjoining Pushkinaya Metro Station).It takes exactly 30 minutes and then a bus ride to the palace for another 10/15 minutes. Lots of buses are available just outside the station. Buy a return ticket for the train journey and retain it for exiting the Vibetsky Train on your return. Whole journey is comfortable and costs only 80 rubles return fare.To avoid the queues for the palace ticket buy it online. !00 tickets are avaible daily and cost 1000 rubles per head.The whole visit becomes a very easy exercise."

The palace is stunningly beautiful and is an absolute must see while in St. Petersburg. I wish we'd had more time to visit the palace.

This is a very inner interesting palace...architecture, grounds, interiors, artwork, historical importance and especially the restored Amber Room. This is very important in Russian history, from Catherine the Great, the Nazi occupation and damage to the palace. The restoration is still underway and the mystery of the whereabouts of the Amber Room's original Amber panels and contents continues. A nice day tour from St. Petersburg. They have a very good shop with lovely offerings at fair prices."

Food in the park is also reasonable and tasty as compared to those in Peterhof. There's 2 or 3 restaurants in the park and I would recommend going to Bonkohckuu where the food is reasonably priced and good. Though the palace is situated in Pushskin, dont be intimidated by the travelling! From St Petersburg, take the metro to Moskoskyaya metro station. Take a public bus 186 or private mini buses to Catherine Palace from the bus stop opposite the metro station. There are quite a number of such mini buses which would bring you to Catherine Palace and some of them even have signs in English and Chinese. It cost 40 rubles per person for the mini buses. The bus driver of the mini bus was kind enough to alert us to alight when we reached."

We were there in August and the temperature inside quickly became warm, the free cloakrooms were efficient and accurate with the way they provided tokens. The inside tour is one way, up the stairs and then along the back of the palace through amazingly beautiful rooms and then back length front of the building. Some of the rooms are narrower than others, resulting in sometimes the guide describing a room to you that you are not in. However the quality of the experience is not really reduced because it is all eye wateringly good. Had less time to spend outside in the gardens than we would have liked. It was a wonderful experience to see something out of St Petersburg, the trip from the city took about 40 minutes."

The queue started outside and if you are desperate for the toilets, as I was, they are inside and nothing in the grounds. The guide would not let me go in front with another group, even though we had tickets. Not a good start. Once inside, the crowds continued and we had to queue for around 20 mins, before we could start going through the rooms. Once it progressed however, it was not too bad. A lot of the rooms seemed similar to me and certainly it showed how the other half lived in Russia at the time the palace was built. It has been restored and maintained well and obviously very popular to visit she the large number of cruise ships docked."

The park is beautiful, but not more than Petergof, also it is mostly covered with sand, and if you are there on a windy day (as we were), then it might be a little unpleasant. The palace is just amazing! Absolutely must see! All the rooms and especially amber room are impressive.

You are also told to leave any bulky jackets in the cloak room, they provide hangers and give you a ticket to collect your jacket at the end. At the beginning there are photographs to show how much the Summer Palace had been damaged in World War 2, I was shocked and also amazed about how good it looks today. We had a guided tour and it was great as she told us interesting information about the items in each room and what the rooms were used for in the past. We had booked our tour from a cruise ship. Once we had seen the inside there were toilets available free of charge and they were clean. There was also a well-stocked gift shop with a good variety of souvenirs. Outside there are spacious gardens with fountains, we were lucky as we were outside when the music and fountain show started. I definitely recommend coming here to see how the Russian royalty lived."

We took the metro to Moskovskaya metro/train station (don't get confused with another nearer station on same line with similar name) on blue line two. The main railway station has an impressive courtyard with a large statue and fountains. There is a road between that and the station and here you will find plenty of marshrutkas going to Detskoe Selo and Pushkin. Many have these destinations in Latin script. They cost R40 per person. If you have any problem ask a young, professionally dressed person as they will often speak a little English. On the way back we got dropped at the end of the line two metro line which makes me think that you can probably also get minibus taxis from here too. The journey is about 20 minutes and we were dropped right by the entrance to the palace. We got the return minibus from exactly the same place- not the opposite side of the road as you might think. We had prebooked tickets for Monday (with late opening til 9pm) but in the event at 4pm when we arrived there were no queues. There did not appear to be any restrictions on the time of individual visits, despite all the guide books stating the contrary. To redeem our prebooked tickets we went to a booth near the main entrance to the courtyard. This is to the far right of building as you look at it from the street. There are lots of stalls selling reasonably priced souvenirs and snacks as well as a couple of cafes on the short walk to the palace. Inside it was pandemonium. Chinese tour groups were charging about all over the place, knocking people on the heads with their ubiquitous selfie sticks and blocking entrance and exit to narrow rooms. I'm generally pretty tolerant of tourist destinations but I got to the point of feeling like I wanted to scream. The problem is that there is one route round the building and most of the rooms are roped off leaving a very narrow channel for the flow of people who are not always considerate of others or their surroundings. One woman was so busy swinging her arms about for a posed photo she nearly knocked over a huge vase to a look of absolute horror from the Russian museum worker nearby. That said, the palace is amazing and the Amber Room alone is worth all the hassle. Even more amazing is that this exquisite gem of craftsmanship was left a gutted, burnt out, ruined shell by Nazi occupation at the end of WW2 and has been lovingly and painstakingly restored with the help of a little German cash. It really brought tears to my eyes trying to understand how something so special and precious could be senselessly trashed. As you exit down a long corridor on the ground floor there are a series of photos with commentary in English about the war and the restoration process which are well worth a read. The curators undertook a massive effort to evacuate the palace's treasures and even as German divisions were pulling into Pushkin they continued to bury artefacts in the grounds. Finally they walked back to Leningrad under fire. I'm sure the British Museum's staff are equally passionate but I can't imagine them going to these lengths. After a footsore and rather exasperating experience inside it was lovely to come out into the exquisite grounds for a wander. We were on a whistle stop tour but given more time I would suggest bringing a picnic and enjoying the grounds before braving tourist mayhem inside. You can hire bikes apparently which is a great idea as the area is large but by the time we re-emerged in the early evening I could not see any rental places open. There are a few stalls selling coffee etc in the grounds."

This is another palace with opulent Baroque rooms and opulent dining sets. The Amber room here is the only unique aspect of this palace.This palace is a restoration of what it used to be. The Germans destroyed it in the war. They cut down trees, dragged them into the palace and set the trees on fire. It took quite an effort by the Russians to painstakingly recreate this palace.Now, if you go, be prepared for incredibly long lines and interminable waiting. If it's raining, you will likely be waiting in the rain just to get to the front door. I'm getting palaced out -- the lines and waiting here were not worth it. Maybe 2 hours of waiting outside and inside for about 30 minutes (or less) of touring the palace. See the Hermitage and Peterhof first.

Price is fineyou are confronted with a palace built in baroque style and further enhanced by the following tsars and their families, an absolute fabulous mixture"

The palace - well as our guide aptly put it \"In Russia, if it looks like gold, it is gold!\" so how many gold decorated rooms must you endure before you grasp that it's good to be a Tsar and own all the country's natural resources? So skip the crowds and pictures (because they will really all look the same) and spend time walking the grounds of the beautiful garden. It's magical and laid out so well. We loved it and was upset that our guide insisted we see the palace. We found it hard to \"go rogue\" with our Russian tour guide... Like she was not comfortable with that al all."

You need the whole day to visit the huge Catherina Palace and walk in enormous park with regular French gardens and landscape English par with a lot of buildings and statues (for example Grotto pavilion, Creaking Pagoda and many other, all of them worth while of seeing.) Do not miss the concert of the Russian choir who are singing church and folk music in the Grotto pavilion in the Park. There is also the Alexander Palace, Alexander Park and Lyceum nearby. The magnificent Cathearina Palace is one of the best examples of the Baroque style. The Palace was originally created by Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 18th century for the Empress Elizabeth (daughter of the Peter the Great), but later redesigned by Scottish architect Charles Cameron for the Empress Ekaterina the Great. Severely damaged during WWII it has been restored carefully late. The palace is huge and glorious with and one breathtaking room after the next, lavishly decorated with gold, marble and precious fabrics. The famous Amber room that was plundered and mysteriously disappeared during WWII is now restored in its glory. From the Cameron's Gallery surrounded with beautiful gardens with a lot of flowers you can enjoy amazing views of the park and the palaces and the Ascension Cathedral with it golden domes. It is famous destination for tourists and thus rather crowded. In my opinion it is worthwhile to take an organized tour from the Petersburg, which allows you to escape the huge line to the palace. The two guides who we had were very qualified. There are many kiosks in the park selling hot drinks, sandwiches and sweets. The numerous souvenirs shop are rather expensive, it is better to buy some amber and matrershka in the city."

Of course you can spend the waiting time within the park .Third, if you reserve a private tour through the hotel itself which should be four days before you can enter the palace immediately.My only critisizim, is that there is no English language guidance or knowledge on site for people whom are planning the trip on thier own i.e. no tour guid..."

She was known as a relatively fair ruler as these things go, but must have been willing to spend a little money when she felt a whim. Catherine had something like 15,000 dresses on hand. No wonder the peasants eventually got upset.This building was destroyed by the retreating Germans during World War II, but it has been slowly restored to its past glory. They aren't quite done yet, but the Russians did have the original plans and a list of the contents, so this gives you the idea pretty nicely. This is definitely a highlight of any visit to the area."

The grounds are extensive and impressive, the outside appearance of the palace is fabulous, especially if you are lucky and the sun shines. Though very busy, there is so much space outside you can amble at leisure and enjoy. Inside the palace is completely the opposite, indeed it was a nightmare! You get a timed entrance which becomes a mass of people all trying to squeeze in. You are herded through the various rooms with large tour groups, very little ventilation so the temperature soars. It is so crowded you struggle to really see anything at ground level. The stewards cordon you off into areas of the big rooms to try and segregate the different groups but all that does is confuse where you are supposed to move to next. We ended up missing a complete wing of the palace as we were swept along in the tide of humanity! Yes the palace is magnificent, BUT the experience for us was a nightmare!"

Apparently everyone walks through the Amber Room so no need to wonder if you will see it. If you wear big coats or take a bag (other than a small-ish purse), you will be asked to check it in. They are very strict about not touching any displays and there is 'security' in every room. You are not allowed to take pictures in the Amber Room. The grounds are stunning. A must for tourists."

The amber room is dreamy, but expensive, the original is gone, but this recreation gives you a good idea what it would have looked like."

Having toured many palaces and castles though, I would say it's nothing special, especially as most everything notable is a reproduction. If you have the time, it's not a waste, but be wary of making a special effort. If you do go try to get there before the big tour groups or be prepared for sardine-like conditions. What I do give high marks is the exterior and the park. It's beautiful and wonderful to stroll and experience."

            "review": "Not worth the tourism torture if you're an independent traveller who doesn't travel en masse.. A bit overrated. Yes, the exterior is impressive. As are many buildings within St. Petersburg. It's very colorful (blue) and ornate. Surrounded by a lovely park. But this isn't Versailles. So you can't begin to compare the two. The interior has been restored so it feels less authentic. Should you take local transport there, which isn't too difficult, you finally arrive to face a huge line of people that gets progressively worse as the day goes on. It moves quite slowly. Mostly because tour groups take precedence and its poorly organized. You might have a tour operator ahead of you or cut the line to end up buying tickets for 25+ people. Which adds to the wait. They should have a booth for tour operators or for those purchasing 10 or more tickets. After that, you have to wait for your allotted time on your ticket. You don't just walk right in. To get the first time slot you should arrive no later than 10AM. Museum opens at 12PM in the summer. Once you finally get in, you're faced with a set of stairs and a narrow corridor blocked my many tour groups. It just doesn't flow. A human traffic jam. On top of all that, you only get to see about 15% or less of the refurbished rooms. It's quite a short exhibition and just down a single corridor within this enormous building. Prior to entering and assessing the size of the building you assume it will take hours. When its actually less than 20 minutes if you're not on a tour and walking through it and perhaps 45 minutes if your stopping to be informed by a guide. Couldn't get out of this palace fast enough. Not a fan of crowd block or being herded along like sheep. If you truly must see this site, I suggest a tour. It might cost more but it will free yourself from having to deal with the 1.5-2+ hour line for tickets and the additional time after that. Groups seem to go through another entrance and have more preferential treatment. As a solo traveler its a bit of a frustrating mess to only actually see little of how the nobility lived. It's mass tourism at its worst."

You also have to wear papers slip on covers over shoes - don't wear heels. If you have large feet - mens size 10+ - then take spare covers from the entrance as yours will split as you walk around! House guides are guards of the treasures and take their job seriously so no messing about or you'll be brought sharply in line. Not a great spot for fracious children!If you get a chance walk down to the lakeside and join one of the tours into the small but elegant stables there 3 male singers perform a short folk song without accompaniment - but which will bring tears to the eyes for the sheer beauty of their voices - well worth videoing - have a few notes to tip them. The gardens on a good day can be enjoyed for at least an hour.Plenty of rest rooms inside the palace but these get busy and its easy to loose companions as coridors look similar so agree your meeting spot!"

I'd recommend reading up a bit prior to the visit to get some timeline of events and to assist in staging the scene. It's quite dazzling and a lot of eye-candy with the gilded work. The Amber Room is awe-inspiring and I believe the only room with no photos/videos allowed - quite welcome since the onslaught of visitors with cameras up everywhere block great viewing.I'd bought tickets to view the Carriage House. This was interesting and my 7 year old daughter who'd recently seen Cinderella was quite entertained by the types of carriages and winter sleds. It'll take about 20 minutes to walk through/read the placards of the carriage house.If you're in a crunch for time, ensure that you save time for exploring the grounds. This was truly (outside the Amber Room) quite the highlight for me. I enjoyed the park much more than Peterhof - less crowded, more spaced out pavilions and just overall peaceful. I wished I had planned better Of course, the stories of Catherine the Great were amusing and that went through my mind as the guide was tastefully recounting some events."

The best way is with a guide to only begin to appreciate everything you will see. Similar to going to the Hermitage, you will not be able to see everything in one visit. But do go and enjoy whatever you can and however much time you can devote. While you are looking at all the detail and all the simply beautiful workmanship, art and the amount of gold used throughout, know that all of this palace had to be restored after WWII. The palace was first built in the 1700's, and added to and changed, etc. through all those years, but during the 2nd World War, the Nazi's had taken over and left everything in ruins, after having ravaged it. Since the mid 1940's the palace has been restored, but only about half of it has been completed. There is still much more to be done. Everything had to be restored from photographs previously taken. Thanks to photography, anyone who appreciates photography and it's importance, can understand all that. So, if you can visit St. Petersburg, put it at the top of your list. The palace is in a nearby town called Pushkin, about a half hour drive from St. Petersburg. You can take pictures throughout, only not in one special room, which is the Amber room. That's fine, because you will be happy with all the rest. Enjoy!"

We got to see all the available rooms including the amber room and had their history and function described in clear English. The guide was an academic historian who spoke English and some French and knew his stuff. The Ecclectica box office (cassa) is on Nevsky Prospect just outside the metro station. Don't be fobbed off by other tour operators who say there are no English tours."

We walked through the gardens and in the pavilion by the lake there were 4 singers who sang the most wonderful Russian acapella songs. We ended up buying a couple of their CDs. This was part of a tour with a guide, which was very helpful, as we visited not only here but also Pavlovsk and the Peterhof gardens. You will need at least 2 hours here, 3 would be better. Like with all Russian palaces and museums, you will be expected to hand in your coats and big bags at the cloakroom. You will also be given overshoes to prevent the original floors fro getting damaged. There are plenty of toilets/bathrooms."

There is the usual irritating Russian habit of the curators of each room trying to hurry you along all the time, but aside from that, the place is wonderful.

We persevered as we had declined the long wait at Peterhof and given the palace a miss there, so wanted to see this one.We had thought that this was a very long wait, but the time in the gardens actually passed quite quickly. They are very different to the Peterhof ones - less formal with individual attractions - none mind-blowing like at Versailles - but attractive all the same.We were a bit apprehensive as we lined up at our allocated time discovering that the 20-minute groupings just meant that you were herded into the large entry area with the previous group that had not yet entered the palace.However, once in the palace, the tour groups separated into little bunches and as individual tourists, we were left to ourselves. We actually tagged along with an English-speaking group for a while and then just wandered through on our own. It was not the sardine-packed experience we has in Versailles. Enjoyed the whole day."

When we arrived at noon - they were giving out tickets for 5:00 PM.

Your timed entrance should be no later than noon - and you can enjoy coffee in the surroundings while you wait.It might be better in the long run to just opt for a tour and be done with it.Check their Website!

There is an alternative entrance further down from the main entrance, not known to tourists, no crowd and used by locals and knowing how to read Russian is helpful can get you better deals. There is also a very nice little restaurant directly next to this entrance which serves traditional Russian food, pancakes, Russian beer, home made fruit punch, kaas. Food is dirt cheap and the same quality as any other fancy but restaurant, without any frills. As this is an area only known to locals Russian you need to place your order by speaking Russian. Add a sign of respect, learn some Russian! My advice to any tourist thinking of visiting Russia (saint Petersburg) is to learn the Cyrillic alphabet which will allow one to read menus, street names and stray away from the tourist traps. THE most interesting sights and eating can be enjoyed outside tourist areas where the knowing Russian is essential. Do learn some Russian phrases, it can open many doors."

Loved this place - makes me sad to think that it was burnt down by the Nazi's and marvel at the skill involved in rebuilding it. Tips: arrive early in the morning - when you buy your ticket (which we queued for almost an hour to do) you are given a time at which you can go into the palace. For us this was four hours after we purchased our ticket. Which was fine because we wandered around the town, had lunch and visited the park. But if you don't fancy doing that you should try and get there early.Tip no. 2: The museums in St. Petersburg are closed on a Monday so if you want to avoid the huge crowds (which we experienced) you should probably choose a different day of the week.Tip no. 3: Beware of the shoe coverings - someone slipped and fell on the wooden floors while we were there. I'll keep my opinions as to the concept of putting the preservation of floors before people to myself....Tip no. 4: If you are not a Russian speaker expect to be awkwardly walking around with a tour guide who you can't understand - as far as I could tell tours in English aren't provided. Luckily I had my own personal interpreter to translate :)"

The visit consisted of three parts - a tour of the palace, music and dancing performance, and a Russian dinner. The best part remained the tour of the palace, which contained so much treasure to admire and appreciate. The palace by then was already closed to other tourists and we, in individual groups of about 25, walked through the different rooms in leisure. The performance was fine but too short to be of any significance. The worst part was the dinner. It was a 4-course dinner, with wine and vodka included. The food however was the usual European dishes, and fell far short of what I expected to be a Russian dinner. On the whole, the evening was an enjoying one and recommended. But be sure to have some food before jumping into the coach as dinner did not begin until about 10.30 pm"

You will be definitely astonished by the incredible Golden Hall, the opulent decoration of the other halls, and of course the reconstructed Amber Chamber is worth being visited (attention, it's the only chamber where they ask you not to take pictures).

Yes, it's a reconstruction, but it's a work of art as a whole, which should be preserved and valued just as the original. Photographs showing the war-time destruction remind of the skill and costs of the restoration. The outside of the building is beautiful, with lakes and other smaller buildings, including the chapel where there is a regular short vocal performance, a stunning finish to our tour. Why a 4 rating? You really have to use a tour guide, or suffer the ill-signed exterior ticket offices.

This palace is absolutely breathtaking from the first time you see it through the trees! There is a lot of walking involved so wear comfortable shoes. I only wish that we could see more of the living areas so we could appreciate how the royalty actually lived. We see more of the assembly halls and the visitor's halls but little furniture. Be sure you spend some time in the extensive gardens. It was a beautiful day and walking through the shaded paths and viewing the various lakes and bathhouses was very relaxing. Also, there were musicians and singers everywhere! What a wonderful trip and a great opportunity!"

The Amber room now has 400 colors of Amber adorning the walls. An appreciation of the imperial glory of Russia would not be complete without seeing the Catherine palace soon after seeing the winter palace in St Petersburg.

There are very many visitors everyday all day as you would expect but because of the way they organise things, the crowd is not overwhelming. This means however that you cannot visit before noon unless you are with a tour group. And you cannot visit the park before you visit the palace. You can save some time also by buying tickets online in advance.Getting there is easy as the mashrutkis are well used to tourists. Go to Moskovskaya metro station which is NOT to be confused with Moskovskaya railway station. After exiting the station look for big statue of Lenin in a big square, go behind Lenin. among others, mashrutkis numbers 342, 545 go to Pushkin. They have a big sign in the window saying Pushkin but it's in cyrillic if you are not sure just ask the driver \"Pushkin?\". Chances are the driver would shout \"pushkin!\" at anyone walking near his bus that looks like a tourist. Hop on the bus, pay the driver the flat fare which is posted inside the bus. It will be fairly obvious when to get off, or just ask the driver. He won't know hardly any English but he knows where most tourists want to get off.If you go in the morning, a good plan would be to go beyond Pushkin and get off at Pavlovtsk where you can spend the morning wandering around the palace and park there. Get back on the same bus to go to Catherine palace for noon or later."

There is the famous Amber chamber.Note, you should buy two separate tickets to the park and to the palace.

Our tour guide, Anna, was so informative - we could not have asked for better. We were on a private tour which we booked ourselves by contacting TJ Travel.

It takes up to two hours to get there going on the Metro to Moskovskaya then walking out some distance to the right to catch a slow bus. If you also plan to have an evening out in St P that same day, then forget it. We arrived at 11:45 and the ticket lady said 'twelve o'clock'. Unfortunately the ticket showed we could enter the Palace only after 14:00, which was too late for us as we were going to a concert the same evening in St P so we ended up having a nice walk in the park then giving away our tickets to some lucky Russians in the ticket queue as we left. Frankly there is not enough adequate information for tourists who just arrive innocently there expecting to visit the palace. Surprising, because in general St P is splendid or English speaking tourists.. ONLY TAKE THIS TRIP WITH A GUIDED TOUR otherwise you are at the mercy of the unexpected. Most people going there were Russians. I would have loved to see the last residence of Tsar Nicholas II, the other palace there, called the Alexander Palace, far more interesting for a british monarchist following the 'family history', however although this appears in the local photographic guide it is sorely and disappointingly under represented on the ground. By the time we had had to wait around and there was nobody to tell us how long the tour takes inside the palace, we had to leave feeling pretty depressed and useless back to St P and did not even see that palace."

This is a very nice palace, as many other palaces built in the same period, many of the rooms are painted gold with lots of artifacts, sculptures and paintings . However, having been to Peterhof and Hermitage, this palace is just another palace to me. It's so far away from the city and the public transportation to this place is so complicated, i wouldn't recommend people going.Don't take me wrong, it's still a very beautiful palace."

The room is about 25X25 ft. 3 walls are panels of intricate amber art work. Originally a gift from the King of Prussia to Peter the Great. The amber gives the room a sunny feel with the light shinning in from the windows on the 4th wall, probably a welcome sight in wet and dreary St petersburg. Although this is not the original, as it disappeared in WWII, it is a true copy and took 20 years to recreate. Parts of this palace were destroyed in WWII, but have been restored. Understandable it was very crowded, but really you must see Catherines palace. It was about an hours bus ride from St Petersburg"

Catherine Palace is a Rococo palace located in the town of Tsarskoye Selo (Pushkin), 25 km southeast of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was the summer residence of the Russian tsars.The beauty of this place with golden halls, statues, beautiful park and the lake will completely blow your mind, besides you will be able to see the infamous Amber Room that was completely recreated in 2003. It was originally constructed in the 18th century in Prussia, the Amber Room disappeared during World War II. Before the room was lost, it was considered an \"Eighth Wonder of the World\".I was really impressed with the golden ballroom of the Palace as well as Park itself. I also purchased souvenirs: an amber ring as well as tin soldiers of world war I for my husband on the small market next to the Palace before going back to the bus. Little tip- it's cheaper to buy on this market rather then in the Palace itself. Excursion lasted 6 hours and we travelled by bus from Saint Petersburg and back. I booked it in advance through Ecletica Tour."

I loved the fact that even though the facade was covered in gold, because it was painted in blue, it didn't look as glitzy as many of the other palaces. This 17th century palace was named Pushkin after a nobleman of that era. I especially liked the grand halls, where many famous dinner parties have taken place. The one structure that looked out of place was the heater - the blue tiles over the glitzy golden decoration in every room suggested that they were there for a good reason. Wood was burnt in the furnace and the brick and tiles reflected the heat and warmed the entire room - a great way to keep warm in the cold winters for Catherine I and other royalty.The amber room is no doubt the highlight. Almost everything was covered in amber. Although the original set was stolen during the World War II, they were later restored.The garden was cozy with a pavillion and a pond, however not as grand as many other palaces. We were told that Catherine I preferred to keep it simple as she could enjoy the many fountains in the Peterhof palace."

Bigger groups are managed at entry to avoid total chaos at coat and bag checks plus control the number of people in rooms at any one time. As a result, large groups must wait their turn whereas small parties can go in much quicker. I imagine having a private guide is a great time saver in summer. The other advantage of a small group is being able to slot between and around some of the bigger groups as you travel through the palace rooms. Tour groups are constantly jostling each other for photos. You need to make a decision between a comfortable time effective experience and the extra expense of your own guide. Majority of rooms are lavishly decorated in gold and with original or replica pieces of furniture from the period. We spent around 1.25-1.5 hours inside the palace then a similar time casually strolling the gardens while viewing the lake and numerous buildings. Many large groups may only spend a short time in the gardens, mostly at the upper level. If planning to go self guided, check specified entry times for individuals as we were told there are specific time slots for tour groups and local and foreign visitors on their own. Overall need to allow at least 5 hours for travel and sightseeing."

It was just after the fall of communism and the world in particular my generation were being introduced to the architectural beauties that lay behind the Iron Curtin for more than 70 years. I was captivated by this picture of this massive blue building with gold tops glistening in the white snow. I made it my ambition to one day visit this place and see it for myself. And that I did! I have been to the Catherine Palace twice in three years and both times it has never failed to blow me away. Whether it be the golden onion domes of the Palace church that greets you as walk towards the complex or the striking blue and gold facade with its imposing statues that mystically lift the palace up from the ground - this Palace will not disappoint. The gardens are immaculate and contain some stunning buildings, bridges and lakes that are scattered throughout. The Hermitage Building and the Turkish Bathhouse were my favorites. The interior of the palace suffered some damage during the second World War including the removal of the famous Amber Room. However, this room has been restored and you are left breathless as you marvel at the intricate detail and fine craftsmanship.The one thing I loved about the Catherine Palace was that the crowds were not as big as they are for places like Versailles or Neuschwanstein. This allowed a little bit of breathing space and created a relaxed visit. Getting to the Palace is easy. We caught a bus from outside the University in St Petersburg. Getting back to the main city is a little trickier if your Russian is not that good. I would suggest getting the Train from Pushkin back into the main city. I would suggest that you double check with your hotel concierge in regards to the best way to get to the palace. I have to say that although I love Versailles, the Catherine Palace is the most amazing Palace I have ever been to and really showcased Imperial Elegance at its best!"

It is well worth the 45 minute trip to the quiet town of Pushkin and the Catherine Palace and park. Be warned, there are a lot of tour groups who come here but it is still a great place to visit. The quality of the gift shops are high so this is a great place to buy good quality souvenirs."

And the ball hall, just amazing, rows of windows on each side, looking out to the garden on both sides, simply fantastic. The amber room, you say? Well, that is nice too, but I was more impressed by the row of \"small\" golden rooms. and the garden and its many buidings, simply like a dream. It makes you realize the Romanov family made more beautiful buildings than any other dynasty in the history of mankind (correct me if I am wrong, but not after you have seen all the palasses in St Peteresburg, St Petershof and Pavlov)"

In the reign of Elizabeth, the \u2018Tsarskoye Selo\u2019 (Tsar\u2019s village) was regarded as the imperial residence. Later, Catherine I rebuilt this modest palace under the direction of architect Rastrelli into a luxurious summer residence. In 1808, the residence increased in size and was proclaimed a town. During the Second World War the Throne Room and several buildings of the palace were badly damaged and looted, many treasures and artworks disappeared, like the famous Amber Room. Nowadays, the Catherine Palace and the surrounding park look as if time has stood still, due to considerable investments in its reconstruction. With the opening after the reconstruction the palace again hit all its splendor with the recreated Amber Room, the Throne Room, Ballroom and Arabesque Hall."

The place consists of room after room of amazingly beautiful furniture, paintings, ceiling, chandeliers, wallpaper. We were told that they used more that 100 kilograms of gold in this palace so everything that can be gilded is. The amber room is beyond description - make sure to find out some of the history of the room. Also, you are not allowed to take pictures in the room and there are very stern guards watching to make sure you do not even try.The grounds are equally spectacular - full of manicured lawns, trees, bushes, rose gardens, flower beds, statues and fountains. In one corner of the park, we discovered a little cottage where a group of men sing beautiful songs in an acoustically superior room. The sound was amazing. A wonderful place to visit."

We also toured the house and because we were a smaller private group, we were allowed to stay in the Amber room as long as we wanted and we were able to take pictures. Normally you have to do a slow shuffle through the palace rooms. (You are not allowed to stop, so the guide tells you to slowly shuffle along or one of the russian guards will yell at you!) There was a guard in the room with us, but she couldn't stop us from taking pictures. It was very apparent she didn't like what we were allowed to do. It was a wonderful opportunity to tour the palace without all the crowds."

I am sure that these 3 Empresses would love to cue up with the other tourists to see what their Palace looks like today, because none of them ever saw it finished. And for 3 years the German solders in WW 2 did their up most to turn it into ashes; as did the fire in 1820. This should be called the 'Restoration Palace', for work continues today - the 'original' shape of the main staircase, for example, has yet to be built.Only a humble 325 metres long I just love the combination of light blue, dark blue, white and gold - it works beautifully; especially if you throw in 5 onion domes.Many, many Serfs died when building this, for they worked 24 - 7, to finish, - and torch-light at night is not the best to stop workers falling from high scaffolding. While I was taking in the Grand Hall, Peter the Great and Cathrine (in costume dress) approached me for a photo for 10 rubles, - they both looked so handsome I agreed - and now if you air-brush me out - I have a terrific photo. However, there are many empty rooms here!Brian, from Perth. W. Australia."

There is only one time to go and that is EARLY to beat the crowds. We visited in February 2013 which is not peak season and were the first to enter with our private guide (very worthwhile if you are visiting Catherine Palace - we used Polina Volkova). We had the pleasure of being the first into many of the rooms so got some amazing photos. Eventually the crowd streams through and even in February you will find it crowded by mid-morning.The amber room is impressive, but it was the history shared by our guide that really made this an amazing visit. The palace was almost totally destroyed by the Germans in WW2 and there are some interesting photos from the time. For example, the Germans having taken Catherine Palace taking their own tourist shots, the palace after it was destroyed (no roof, walls blown apart, artwork looted or ruined), and even a photo of a bomb the size of a small truck meant to detonate after they left but which didn't go off.The destruction of Catherine Palace lead to a major restoration effort. At the time, there were limited people with the skills or experience to do the work. This resulted in the education and development of people in restoration work to the point St Petersburg is now renown for its skills in this field.The parklands are wonderful to stroll through, particularly in the beautiful snow. Allow plenty of time and this was a better place to visit that Peterhof if you are there in winter as Peterhof's fountains are all closed down.I've seen palaces throughout Europe (England, Spain, France, Italy) and nothing compares to Catherine Palace."

We enjoyed looking at the gold-plated fountains as well as the beautiful landscaped gardens. Also, we explored the luxurious palace with gold-covered doors and panels. After visiting the Amber Room with its walls covered with amber, we can say that the palace was really stupendous and simply worth visiting in Russia."

On the way we see Tsarkoye sell, place were Pushkin was born. Then you walk into the Summer palace. There was a Russian band playing music in the front of the palace. Restoration was proceeding in the outer facade, which detracted us from the beauty of the palace.Which still did look very imposing and beautiful. Inside of the palace, the staircases were just absolutely stunning! The whole palace was bombed and destroyed by the Nazis and has been painstakingly restired( there are pictures of how the palace looked). Reminded me of the Windsor palace. There are many rooms , bedrooms, dining rooms,etc. definitely worth the visit to see how the Tsars used to live.The garden is also very beautiful and a nice walk! For shopping: the museum stores were very good. Cheaper stuff is sold outside in stalls,"

The drive shows the industrial outskirts of the city, then some quite lovely countryside. Entering the park, you first go through the Egyptian gates, which seem out of place. The town is small and quietly residential. Entering the palace grounds you go through the gold covered main gates and pass the gold onion tops of the chapel. An enormous amount of restoration has been done both inside and outside the buildings. Damage from the war was extensive, but you can hardly see it. Everything that can be gilded is and it is almost overwhelming. We were greeted outside by a small marching brass band, and later, while touring the extensive gardens and park, also were treated to a group of five men singing Russian folk songs. The grandeur is over the top and it is hard to believe anyone could live like this. Well worth the visit to experience the history, see the Amber Room, and stroll the gardens. My visit was in August, so it was hot. Not much available as far as refreshments and the outdoor vendor wanted rubles, not Euros. There is a small outdoor market on the way out. Expect to spend a few hours here."

Many Russians like to spend the day in the beautiful park, so admissions are separate. There were several couples having wedding photos taken in the park.There is a small lake in the park and sculpture, so it is a great place to have a walk. There is a small pavilion with art on display, so don't miss that one as it is not usually mentioned in travel writings. There was a lovely display of ceramics when I was there in Sept. 2014. Read up on the story of the Amber Room before you go. It was stolen by the Nazis and very little was ever recovered. A local workshop reconstructed it. You can't take photos of the Amber Room, but the museum sells a small booklet. You can take photos in the rest of the museum, but I don't remember if you need to pay extra for permission.The palace is not very large, but is about 25 km out of town. I got there easily on a minibus. Bring along a flyer or picture from your guidebook to show the driver where you are going. He will tell you when your stop arrives--you can't see the palace from the minibus, but it is just around the corner from the stop--easy to find. The bus stop to return is just across the street from the one where you arrived. It makes a very pleasant day viewing art and gardens."

A member of our party insusted on also doing the Agate (or Jasper) Rooms, so our tour of the palace was at a gallop. This is not to be recommended as it deserves to be taken at leisure. Although not as grand as the main palace, the Agate Rooms were fascinating and worth seeing - but not at the expense of racing round the palace.

The palace was breathtakingly beautiful - restored to perfection - bright, glittering with gold, white, and pale turquoise. It was such a contrast to the (what was then) shoddy construction of so many other buildings. The artwork it contained was very different from the Soviet Realism which was then the only style approved by the state.An experience I'll never forget!"

It took two metros, one bus, one taxi (running late) and a train to go back and forth from St Petersburg. And of course Cyrillic will make it a challenge, but its definitely worth it. The park is amazingly big and worth spending half a day seeing and walking it. I would pack a lunch and just take my time next time. I can imagine the Tsar, Catherine, and/or the royal family strolling these beautiful gardens.... completely worthy of a monarchy. The Hermitage is the poor sister and completely did not impress me. If we could only move the Rubens, Van Dyks and the Rembrandts to this grandiose palace! The tour only covers a wing but please spend the 400 rubles for this. It is truly amazing and it does have that homey feeling that is missing at the Hermitage. Get up early and make your way to this place, take your time and spend the day here."

There was the dining room and also the great hall not forgetting the best room of all was the amber room, totally magnificent. This was followed by the grand gardens of monuments, bridges and a lake.

Mainly painted in blue and white, the ornamental mouldings and atlantes on the exterior wall of the Palace were in wood colour (tan). If they had been gilded, the Palace would have taken on a much more monarchic air. Having said that, once you enter the staterooms inside, you would be blinded by the overwhelming use of gilded mouldings, caryatids and pilasters which reflected the extravagance of Empress Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great and his wife Catherine (whom the palace was named ), who was said to have commissioned the renovations to rival the Versailles in the seventeenth century and resulted in what it is today. There were so much to see, mural paintings on the ceiling of the 1,000 square meters lavishly gilded Great Hall (there were two models dressed up in historic gowns in this room for tourists to take photos with for a fee), the decidely different Green Dining Room, many drawing rooms and studies (I was particularly impressed with the finely crafted antique roll up desks and the blue and white tile stoves) and of course the legendary Amber Room. I learnt that the Amber room was completed in 1770 but was dismantled and taken out of the country by German troops in 1941. Recreation was only commissioned in 1982 and was completed and reopened in 2003 after 20 years work. Noted that photography is not allowed in this room only but one could take a long shot through the door way before you enter the room. The garden of this Palace however was far less impressive than the Peterhof Palace."

So the Petro Palace Hotel concierge kindly arranged for us to go with one of their English speaking tour guides and hire one of their cars for 4 hours. The Palace is about \u00bd hr drive from St Petersburg. You have to pay to go into the gardens and get a ticket and then show your ticket to be allowed entry into the Palace. The queue at 12 noon was quite long but had all but gone by 1 pm. You have to wear paper slip-ons over your shoes.

Fortunately to pay for the gold, amber, paintings, and more, this place is open to the public. No longer a place just for nobility, the palace is open to all and often holds public events. The guides describe the history so well and with great pride. If you go to Russia, do not miss it."

It was left in ruins and looted because of Nazi occupation in WW II. The restoration work began almost immediately after the war. I was especially excited about viewing the famous \"Amber Room\", a room made of amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors. Created in the 18th century, it was looted by Nazi Germany and disappeared after World War II. In 1979, efforts were undertaken to rebuild the Amber Room. In 2003, after decades of work by Russian craftsmen and financed by donations from Germany, the reconstructed Amber Room was opened in the Catherine Palace. The palace was beautiful, but it is almost totally a reproduction. The new paint and heavy gold leaf did mimic the old original walls and finishes, but everything was bright and garish. Even the Amber room seemed shiny and modern. Scattered around, there were some authentic old paintings, furniture and porcelain that had been purchased for the palace from auctions and antique shops."

However, I remember that the rooms of the Catherine Palace were absolutely exquisite, elaborate, and ornate, even more impressive than the Hermitage. The Amber Room was unbelievable and unique. The gardens were relatively simple, but lovely and peaceful. The crowds waiting to get in the palace were unreal. A practical hint: if one bathroom has a long line, look for another. One ladies' room had the longest line I have ever seen in my life, but our guide led us to another facility just down the hall with no line at all!"

An English speaking tourist showed us the line to get in which was long but didn' t appear too daunting. After a few minutes it became clear that the line didn't seem to move except sporadically and in very short bursts. We learned later that tour groups, of which there are many and use a different entrance, take precedence over individuals. After an interminable wait of almost two hours we were admitted, only to stand on line again to purchase tickets. Inside the palace rooms are stunning but so packed with tour groups that it is extremely difficult to actually see anything.If you go, I strongly suggest joining a tour group or hiring a private guide to avoid the lines. Go as late in the day as possible to avoid the crowds and allow yourself at least 2-3 hours inside plus and hour for the grounds."

Before we got into the Palace, we were entertained by a group of 4 musicians playing out front ( for tips ) . They were great and very funny. They were playing, and suddenly they lightfootedly moved in unison to the left and then back to the right . The Palace was a little warm inside , having no A/C of course , but it was tolerable because windows were opened to let some air inside . Wonderful place to see, mind blowing wealth on display , and great historical value . The Gardens are huge, grand , fabulous, and extremely well kept . A definite must see !"

Happily, photos are allowed inside the palace, unlike at Peterhof - which you also must see. The amber room is stunning - sadly though, no photos allowed in this room. I definitely recommend going with a tour with a Russian guide to help you navigate through, read the signs, tell you where to go. You must stop in the little house in the garden by the lake where the singers gather, the acapella group. The building is acoustically perfect, you will be blown away! And if you are physically disabled in any way, be ready for a tough time. Traveling abroad for someone who uses a walker or wheelchair is difficult, no kidding, but it was particularly difficult in St. Petersburg and other cities in the Baltic that we visited. Staff are unsmiling and unwelcoming, but we got used to that in Russia. Carry on, enjoy, soak in the beauty and the history."

The best time to tour is early in the morning before the large crowds arrive around 10 am. After that, like all tourist attractions anywhere in the world, the crowds become a distraction. Outside the palace are lots of street vendors with lots of \"tourist\" gifts for sell. They readily take euros and are far less aggressive as those in other parts of Europe.

I should say at the outset that the rooms in the palace are stunning, and the grounds are nice enough. But the overall experience that is created by the inefficiency of the entry system basically ruined our day. First, there's a long line to buy a ticket to enter the grounds around the palace. Once inside, visitors are treated to yet another line to buy tickets for the palace itself. Here, expect a 2 hour wait. This line is completely chaotic, with groups of people regularly cutting in ahead of you. We counted about 100 people cutting in. The ticket handlers do nothing about this and seem happy to let people regulate themselves, which leads to obvious unrest. Once inside the palace, you have to wait in line to see each room and are hearded like cattle from one room to the next. There are so many tour groups that it's hard to enjoy a room before being asked to move on. There's fewer rooms than you'd think, so before you know it you're back outside feeling robbed, depressed, and likely very hungry. Naturally, there are no food options anywhere other than an atrocious little cafe on the palace grounds. The highlight of the day was the taxi ride home."

In one of the hallways, you can see photos of the immense destruction which will make you marvel at the restoration that has been completed so far. I asked our guide what the Russian people thought of so much money being spent on restoring the palace to it's former glory and she said they are quite proud to see it done. Of course I was asking someone born and raised in St. Petersburg which is a showcase of Russian grandeur and wealth and very much meant to impress tourists. Unbelievably oppulent now and still not as opulent as it was in it's crowing glory days. One room has walls covered in hand-painted Chinese silk, another is completely made of amber. There is a great deal of marble, beautiful parquet flooring and chinoiserie along with a great deal of gilt. Quite amazing. The gardens are pretty but much more low key than those at Peterhof."

And I have seen over 80 so far!We were part of an exclusive VIP-\"after public hours\"-tour, with Vodka/caviar reception, marching band, exclusive small group tour and ending with classical concert, dinner and folklore dance show. A little more expensive then the standard ticket, but what an experience! Always enough space and time to see the magnificent AMBER room and all the other fantastic exhibits. The architecture is great. In my opinion Catherine Palace comes out on top when comparing to Versailles in Paris or Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna."

This is the palace with the amber room in which everything (walls, picture frames, mirror frames, etc.) is made of amber. The artisans who rebuilt this room after the original panels were \"lost\" after the war certainly did themselves proud. There are long lines to get in, but a small band was playing music while we waited - they even played music from Swan Lake and \"danced\" like the four swans. As with most of the old buildings in St. Petersburg, there's no air conditioning and few restroom facilities, so be prepared for that. We were there on a 90 degree day, so the mass of humanity made it particularly stuffy, but I still enjoyed everything about it."

One tour offered was to Catherine's Palace, the former summer palace of the Russian czars. It was at one time occupied by the Nazis and subsequently nearly destroyed. Thankfully, major portions of this beautiful building have been restored and it is now available for tours. It is a VERY POPULAR tourist destination, so be prepared for lots of people and long lines. It seems like there are two different entrances and one never knows (nor can choose) which one will be assigned. Our tour guide told us that both were similar and allowed one to see the exact same number of restored rooms; just slightly different. The highlight of the tour (and why the lines are long and slow) is the Amber Room. During WWII, the room was \"lost\" (of course, the rumor was that the Nazis had something to do with this). In any case, after many years of reconstruction work funded by the German government, in 2003 the room was reopened. Absolutely no pictures are allowed in here, but people want to stand and gaze at it for hours. This is why the lines slow down. As one moves through the various rooms, one gets a real sense of what it was like to come to a palace...to be overwhelmed by opulence. Our guide told us that that was the main purpose of this palace; not necessarily to live there (the royal family actually preferred another palace for that) but to entertain and amaze people. The grounds also include extensive gardens, although we did not have time to go through them. We were also quite amused to be greeted not once but twice by mini brass bands. The second one (right outside the entrance) was a great amusement and made the waiting time go by quicker. This group is larger than the first and quite entertaining. They played the dance of the swans from \"Swan Lake\" and even moved the line of players left and right in the manner the dancers do in the ballet during this number. It was great!"

Originally built as a modest two story summer home for Catherine - wife of Peter the Great, the palace was expanded tremendously by her daughter the Empress Elizabeth. Now it's an unbelievable, over-the-top building with something wonderful to experience in every room. The grounds are also extensive and have smaller summer \"follies\" to visit; surprising vistas every direction you turn. If possible, try to get there first thing to be in line when it opens. There were military men playing music when we arrived (before the gates opened) and being amongst the first in made for a less crowded experience - well worth getting up early. Although we didn't have a chance to explore the town of Pushkin (where the palace is located), it looks like it might be worth a stroll as well."

Following a major fire much of the building has been reconstructed, and renovation is still taking place. As you approach, the palace appears as an imposing but colourful structure with pretty gold onion dome on the roof. Through the entrance gates and you are in a huge courtyard with the palace on one side and the gardens on the other. Great photo opportunities.Inside there are shops and toilets if you need them There were many tour groups here so had to queue to get into the main palace. On entry you have to put some stylish green covers over your shoes. You then follow a set route through the various rooms of the palace, waiting for the group in front to move on. Many of the old rooms are spectacularly ornate, and the main attraction, the Amber Room, was unusual. It was not rushed and we had plenty of time to hear all about the history of this amazing palace.We would love to explored the grounds further but had to get back into the city. It is worth a visit, but recommend that you go with a guide to fully appreciate what you are seeing."

Home of the world famous amber room, I actually didn't like the amber room, but loved every other room and the gardens. I loved the gold room, which leads to the never ending corridor, you feel like you are looking into two mirrors and seeing a never ending reflection. I loved the transition from the gilted rooms to some of the newer styles. I loved the furniture and the stories that went with them. Some of the pictures at the end of the tour that show the extent of damage to the palace before the renovation are quite shocking, it's really unbelievable to think it's the same place. In one of the little grotto's in the gardens there was a 4 man group who sang like a choir, the acoustics of the building made it sound like there were hundreds of men singing. It was a truly beautiful moment. I did love this palace but if I had limited time on my itinerary and I wasn't hoping to see the amber room, I would choose the Peterhof gardens or the Faberge museum over this palace. Those were my favourite parts of my overall tour."

I'm not particularly interested in history but the guide kept my attention and just as I was getting bored of seeing any more rooms..........they finished.

When we signed up for a tour of that name (above) through our cruise operator, I wondered if it would be worth it. Well, what an unbelievable evening it was. It began about 8PM. We started with a wonderful, spirited outdoor performance by the palace guard's brass band, then were ushered inside the palace for a tour. After donning shoe covers to protect the parquet floors, our small group got to tour a number of rooms in the palace while a harpsichordist and flutist in period dress played in the background. The artwork, gilt, and grandeur in the palace is indescribable. I won't even try. The evening continued with a string quartet playing Rimsky-Korsakov in the ballroom while actors portraying Catherine and her consort were in attendance with us all. The guests sipped glasses of champagne as we watched a pair of dancers in period attire dance a pas de deux to the chamber music. Following the performance, \"Catherine and her consort\" left by royal horse-drawn carriage. Dinner followed. It was quite a regal experience!"

No organised group, no bus transfer, I simply took the train from central Petersburg to the town, a bus from the railway station to the park entrance, and queued for a ticvket for myself. And that's where the bad experience starts...The place is extremely crowded. I understand that everyone else there is just a tourist like me who wants to see the same place as me, and that the management is not responsible for the large number of visitors, but this review is about my experience, not about attributing blame to anybody, so I guess it legitimately affects the review. Essentially, you queue for something like 15 minutes to get a ticket to the park, and once inside, you'd have to queue again, for at least another 45 minutes, to get a ticket to the palace (you cannot get into the palace or even the palace ticket booth without entering the park first, for which you need a park ticket). Both times, you queue in the blistering sun, without anything around to give you shade. Prices are not extremely high, but considerable (120 roubles for the park ticket, 400 roubles for the palace). Inside the palace, the assembly line experience continues. You are herded from one crowded room into another, and even if you don't join a tour the wardens will ask you to move on if you stay in a room for too long. The tour takes, I hear from Tripadvisor (I didn't take it myself) only about twenty minutes, but even if you stroll around on your own it won't take much longer than that. Staff, and that applies throughout from ticket clerks over wardens to salespeople etc, are generally rather harsh and unfriendly, most of them speaking only Russian, and even those who do speak English do not seem to include words like \u201cplease\u201c, \u201cexcuse me\u201c or \u201cthank you\u201c in their vocabulary.This is a pity, because the place itself, both the park and the palace, and above all of course the amber room, are marvellously beautiful. The conditions around the visit ruin the experience to a great degree, though."

Booked this trip via Thomson Cruises and we had the guide from Hell.The palace itself is magnificent considering the damage done during WW2 and the incredible restoration project that is ongoing. Whilst we were waiting to go in we were entertained by a costumed marching band who were excellent and speeded up what would have been a very boring 30 min wait. They do not allow you to take larger bags round with you but there is a secure coat & bag drop next to the toilets.You have to put on paper overshoes but, be aware, one size does not fit all and one of our party was shouted at for not wearing them properly due to the possible damage to the parquet flooring.There are stairs to enter the main rooms so some areas may not be suitable for those with mobility issues.The rooms themselves are magnificent and it's hard to believe that it was an empty shell within living history. The replica of the Amber room is the only area that does not permit photography but you can video and photo all other areas. When I tried to ask questions about some of the items I was told not to ask question and I feel it was obvious that she did not know anything that did not come from her script. Due to the weather and the attitude of our guide we were unable to experience the gardens and we were rushed through the rooms a lot faster than a lot of our party would have liked as they were slow walkers and wanted to enjoy and absorb as much of the Palace as possible. There is a gift shop which takes Credit cards, Euros, US dollars and Roubles. The toilets inside the palace are free and there are some pay toilets outside that cost \u20ac0.50 to use. Would definitely recommend a visit but try and choose your guide carefully."

As our tour group waited in line, outside, in the palace's courtyard, which is surrounded with a black and gilt trimmed wrought iron fence and gate, I admired the unique exterior features of this building. Unlike the Winter Palace and Peterhof's Grand Palace, this multiple storied long rectangular building is painted light blue with white trim. Large sculptured red clay figures of Atlas, holding up the world, surround each window. The last czar who lived here with his family was whisked away during the Russian Revolution from these lavish surroundings to Siberia to be executed. After WWII, this palace was a ruin with only 5 original rooms remaining in good condition; 50 other rooms had to be completely redone using photos to do the restoration. Pictures inside show the extensive damage and then comparing those to the finished result, I just marveled at Russian workmanship. The sparkle of the gilt decor in these rooms, like the State rooms, reception hall, dining hall, and sitting rooms stayed with me for some time because it was so ornately done. For example, rooms are accessed through a continuous hall, with doorways in one line. When I looked backwards through these hallways, it seemed like I was seeing the same gilt adorned massive doorway through many mirrors all reflecting the same image. The amber room, a square room which probably is a major attraction for tourists, is much smaller in comparison to the other rectangular rooms and is \"wallpapered\" from ceiling to floor with Baltic amber tiles. This is just beautifully done and the rich soft amber color complements the gilt decor in nearby rooms. Another room that really impressed me was similar to the Hall of Mirrors in the Versailles Palace with its mirrors reflecting images on the opposite walls, French doors for windows, and many huge sparkling crystal candelabras. In this room, the ornate gilt wood trims on the walls and around the doors are out of this world. Some of the private rooms used by royalty have silk damask on the walls, painted ceilings, royal blue delft corner fireplaces, writing desks with drawers, and upholstered chairs. In one of these rooms, a dining table had been set up for dinner with a white tablecloth and a decorative rope of flowers. A mannequin was shown wearing a dress worn by Catherine in the 1700's (nearby on a wall was a painting of her in the very same style of dress). Signs in English placed discreetly beside a doorway indicated the name of the room, but the rooms were so crowded I missed most of these signs. I was glad our itinerary allowed time (about 1 hr) to visit Catherine's Palace, but we didn't have time to walk in the surrounding gardens. These grounds were visible from the windows in the palace, however, so that had to do. This palace is located 15 miles out of St. Petersburg in Pushkin (about a half hour drive) which appeared to be a very pleasant town as we drove through it with parks alongside the roads and many trees. We had seen Peterhof, the Grand Palace, in the morning which is about a 40 minute drive from Pushkin. With a 1 hr lunch in between, I found that visiting these two palaces outside of St. Petersburg in one day was not tiring as I could rest my feet in the bus while being driven from one place to the next. If you have time for only 1 of these palaces, it is a toss up to which one to go to. Either one will give you a sense of grandeur of the czarists' homes."

Catherine's palace of course you would expect everything to be extremely posh, but as our guide pointed out she was consumed by GOLD, and everything that could be embellished was gilded.It was a bit overwhelming but her love for gold carried thru every room regardless, suggest you wear sunglasses because of the glare ( kidding of course ). The palace grounds were magnificent also."

            "review": "One of the best palaces!. Spent about 5 hours visiting Catherine Palace on a beautiful day. Got there from St. Petersburg by taking the subway, then a local bus. Total transit time to the site was one hour, which was also very easy and cheap. We arrived at the palace around 10 am. Since we didn't have pre-purchased tickets, we looked at the line of people waiting to purchase tickets when the ticket office opened at noon. Since only about 8 people were in line, we took a chance and decided to walk around the grounds to look at the park. Bad decision! We returned at 11:15 am to find that ~50 people were now in the line. That doesn't sound like much, but what we didn't know is each person was holding a place in line for others. For example, the individual in front of us was holding places for 13 others. So at noon the line went from 50 to ~200 in a matter of minutes. It took us until 1:15 pm to get into the palace. So if there is one recommendation, get there early if you aren't on a tour or have tickets...and get in line. The palace tour itself took ~40 minutes, and was well worth the wait. The place is spectacular and unlike the Peterhof Palace, you can take pictures.The only shortcoming the site lacks given the number of people visiting is sufficient dining facilities. We stopped by one restaurant located beside the lake and had an enjoyable lunch, but their overall dining capacity is limited. Visiting Catherine Palace is a great day trip to take from St. Petersburg, well worth the time and money."

We were blessed with superb weather throughout our visit which only highlighted how well restored the palace and grounds to their original condition. The gardens are well worth visiting all the way down to the lake area, bearing in mind that many of those who created the landscape originally worked on Versailles, which is evident as one walks around. Definitely worth the effort to leave the city and make this part of any visit to St Petersburg."

We were told it was best to visit early morning before the crowds gathered at the gate to enter the grounds. Our tour group were there 9 oclock and there was still a crowd waiting.An orderly group were waiting at the gate when along came an American group straight to the front of the gates as though there was nobody there and expected to be let in .Unfortunatly they were.Once inside the gardens there was another crowd of people waiting to get into the palace. To keep the crowd entertained there was 4 trumpeters play Russian music and dancing. Once inside the rooms are magnificent with gold leaf covering the walls and statues. There is so many people viewing that you just have to go with the flow and move when they move. Then there is the amber room where the whole of the room is covered with pieces of amber.We were told by the guide thet during the war the palace was just about destroyed by the Nazis who laid bombs in the rooms to destroy the place even riding motor bikes in the corridors. Fortunatley over the years it has been restored back to its original splender but how people could live in such opulence when people were dying of starvation outside makes you think does it not. Well worth a visit The gardens and lake are worth a visit if you have time. A lot of the statues were buried in the grounds during the war then dug up afterwards....."

This palace has gone through good and bad times. When Catherine lived here it was a wonderful place for family and entertaining her cousins from the other monarchies of Europe. Then came the revolution and you see why the peasants revolted. She had the gold and they had nothing to eat. Then the Soviet period, followed by World War II. The sad part is that the Nazis lived in it, thus keeping it in good shape, during WWII. However, when they knew they had lost the war, they torched the place. The Russians have rebuilt it, and are re-doing the rooms one by one. They are replacing the gold leaf on the outside of the palace to make it look like it did when Catherine was alive. It is beautiful. On display are photos of how it looked after the Nazis destroyed it. Make sure to take a close look at the Amber Room \u2013 with amber panels on the walls. The comment of the other folks on the tour, was that they were trying to get decorating ideas to use at home. Ah, if only."

As in all of Russia no helpful signs unless you read Russian. You pay for a park ticket - 120 rub per peeson to get in park then you pay once inside the palace itself. Have to wear protective foot mitts. Again why don't people move after getting the miss before trying to balance on one foot trying to get them on. We don't bother with the audio and guide. Wait until you get up the stairs and then push past all the tour groups or spend hours listening to guides drone on and on. The Park is very nice and is probably the best bit. Spent most of the day there waiting for the queue to subside before going into the palace. Beware that there is renovation work going on at the moment so does spoil the outside a bit. Getting there from st.petersberg was an adventure. Used bus then train then bus. From Pushkin station use bus 382 370 371 or 378. Little old lady in kiosk outside station gave us a little piece of paper with this info on - obviously been asked many times before.

The museum had pictures of the palace after its recapture.Our guide was so-so and the wait was long even for the tours. The palace is closed on Tuesday's and we were a Monday group, so more groups then normal were there. Because of this the vendors by 4:00 PM were low on drink and food.

The inside of the Palace is all gold in every room , get there early in the morning to avoid the crowds , we got there just before they opened and had rooms to ourselves walking round, the gardens are worth a look with lakes and fountains , one of the best places to visit in St Petersburg"

We joined the end of the queue at just after 11.30am and they only seem to let a certain number in every half hour. There is no queue management so lots of cheeky people just walked further up and pushed in with no one to stop them - very annoying. We eventually got in just before 2pm. As you have to buy tickets at the park entrance for the park why can they not issue timed tickets so you can go and look round the grounds instead of wasting 2 hours in a queue!So we get into the palace and then join another queue for the tickets and after that another queue to actually enter the palace rooms.The rooms in the palace are absolutely stunning and take your breath away. The Amber room is also very special. The palace is amazing but if I had known how long it took to get in I don't know whether I would have bothered."

The palace is huge; the tour this time did not include some rooms I saw when here in 1994, but others like the amber room were included. The crowd control here was much better than at the Hermitage, with roped off paths to follow (of course, we had a guide as well.) Since the area you can walk are generally on the periphery of the rooms, you are able to get good photographs without people in them. The grounds looked lovely from the windows, but as it was absolutely raining cats and dogs that day, we did not spend much time there."

Yes, there was a crowd and we had to wait in line to go in, but it wasn't that long a wait and there weren't so many people that we couldn't get beautiful photos without strangers in them. The rooms were impressive and restoration work extensive. Even our 7-yr-old said \"Wow!\" in the famous Amber Room. Our guide was very informative, including regarding the gold-leafing and Russia's recent ban on smoking in public in addition to all the history ... The day would not have been the same without him. Our half-day visit ended with a 'traditional Russian lunch' on-site, including bread, salad, soup, and main course (described as 'like beef stroganoff except with chicken ... and rice' -- gave us a chuckle but it was good), as well as ice cream and a shot of vodka. Note: Backpacks are not allowed (purses and camera bags ok); there was a coat check but we were advised to leave our bags on the guarded bus instead, which we did without issue."

We therefore looked round the gardens and joined the queue for tickets at 11am, a full hour before the palace was due to open to individuals, at which point there were about 100 people in the queue ahead of us. By the time that the Palace opened at 12 noon there were probably more than 1000 people in front of us who had pushed in, many of them in large tour groups. We finally were admitted to the Palace at 1pm, more than three hours after we started queuing. Once inside we were able to buy a ticket relatively quickly, but very little information was available - no English language signage or information, so we really had no idea of what we were looking at for most of the time. It appeared that you were meant to join a group for the tour, but it wasn't explained to us how the system worked, so we saw it mostly on our own. The Amber Room is truly spectacular, but if we had known that we were going to have to spend three hours queuing to see it we probably wouldn't have bothered going."

Going with a tour group allows less waiting in line & quicker admission but nevertheless, it is a very busy tourist attraction. Lines are everywhere. There were so many buses it was unbelievable (multiple remote parking areas after drop off) & if one is separated from the group, forget about finding them or the bus. There were no fees for photography, as in some other museums, & all rooms excepting the amber room could be photographed. I would suggest having an emergency contact # for your guide in case of separation. Nevertheless, a fabulous place. We went to Peterhof primarily for the gardens, bath house & outdoor spaces & to Catherine's for the interior primarily, with just a quick trip around the grounds. I would recommend that approach as the architect & design for both Peterhof & Catherine's are the same, so the interiors are not that different. Lovely day! Recommend."

There are pictures showing the burnt out shell of this building after the war so it is amazing to see what has been accomplished.We had to pay an extra fee in order to be allowed to take pictures inside ($5 or 4 euros) but even so you are still not allowed to take photos in the amber room which is quite jaw dropping - no explanation given. There may have been photos on sale at the souvenir stalls but we were not given any time to shop. Everyone has to put on shoe protectors before entering the grand rooms with their patterned wooden floors. This is another hassle as it is all so crushed.This is a beautiful palace and well worth seeing but the lack of proper organisation as well as no cover for the extremely long queues standing in heavy rain (which must happen often) is very off putting and left us feeling disappointed with this visit."

What a great decision! The crowds were way down in numbers with many tours having 50% or more cancelations. We were on a Grand Circle boat, the Rossia, which would normally hold 200 travelers, but had 160 for this trip. The number of crew and service staff remained the same, but there was one fewer Tour Director. This was great for seating in the restaurant and service in general, but I felt sorry for those on other cruises where they cut the staff due to smaller numbers of travelers. Anyway, with the ruble down and the crowds gone it was fantastic. We were able to stroll around Catherine Palace with very few crowds\u2026this was true of the Hermitage, and Peterhof as well. Our guide, Natasha, was not only knowledgable, but really honest about Russians and their thoughts and feelings about the US and Americans as visitors. She discussed the serfs and the human cost of these huge and grand palaces and the cost of repair and reconstruction after the Great Patriotic War, WW II to us. She never sugar coated the Stalin years, but pointed out buildings and remaining successes the era as well as discussing the cost to Russia in human suffering before and after the war. We were also fortunate to hit the best weather possible with 3 days in the 80's, unheard of for May in St. Petersburg. The remainder of the trip was also beyond expectations, with Moscow being a very interesting city, not the industrial backwater I had suspected. The subways were beautiful, clean and pretty easy to navigate with such extensive routes that no place was out of reach. I will say that the traffic was as bad as I have ever seen, topping the goat rope of Quito Ecuador by a slight margin, with 99% of the cars holding a single person. this made the subway even more attractive.If you are considering a Russian trip I highly recommend getting out and doing it!

There's nearly a mile of Palace filled with wood inlay furniture, plush furnishings, art works, and, of course, the incredible Amber Room. You eyes will feel blinded by the awesome gilding. Catherine created the grounds on a more human scale than Peter did at Peterhof, so it's peaceful and pleasant to walk in this country setting."

The Nazis set fire to the Palace & dismantled & stole the amber room as they retreated from Leningrad-at the end of your tour you see how things were before the restoration. The time and money put into the restoration is impressive as are the results. Your eyes are dazzled by the amount of gold leaf, mirrors and Dutch tiled fire places -these are magnificent rooms if slightly over the top,but it works as room follows room. Then you get to the Amber room - a master piece that will mellow with time. The dedication & workmanship of the Russian restorers is to be admired. Good selection of shops at the end of the tour plus excellent bathroom facilities. Made a quick tour of the gardens which are massive with different layouts. Would have like to stay longer but we are on a tour & off we go."

If you have visited the Versailles in France, this museum has a lots of rooms that ressemble the Versailles. The Grand Hall actually looks like the \"Palais de Glace\" from Versailles. The paintings, the numerous rooms well decorated with gold, the size of the structure, the beautiful gardens, not to forget the Amber Room... where you are not allowed to take pictures but where you won't believe the beauty and richness of that room. All of the amber panels were actually transferred from the Winter Palace (Hermitage) in 1755 to this Palace. What's even more amazing is that the whole Palace was rebuilt after World War II, by great architects, and based on its original design, using old pictures and photos. In our visit to this Palace with our Cruise Ship (Royal Princess), we got to see many beautiful rooms decorated in Baroque style. With our guided tour, we did not have enough time to visit all of the parks as the site is very big. But if you plan a visit to St. Petersburg, you might want to consider that as there are plenty of things to see in both Catherine's Park and Alexander's Park (over 40 points of attractions not to miss). Although we had seen the Versailles in France, there was something different with that Palace and we were very happy about our visit. There are little boutiques inside the Palace, where you can purchase books, etc. I would recommend you get the Palace and Parks book as a souvenir as it includes a lot of points you may not get a chance to see during your visit. In addition, I had looked elsewhere to see if I could get such a book, and my chances were'nt paying. As well, there is a lot of walking involved and if you or someone travelling with you have limitations, you might find it difficult to visit this place. Not matter what plan you make to visit this place, you will not be disappointed. Booking with a tour might also save you time for the entrance."

Although considered just a day trip by many, I highly suggest that visitors make this a one-night, two-day visit. It is leafy green in summer, cool and very quiet. Avoid the bus and hire a taxi on line to drive you direct from St Pete's. The cost is about 80 bucks, but worth it. The Catherine Palace, the huge turquoise one, is super, the highlights being the gardens in my view, but do not miss the Alexander Palace a few blocks away. (The highlight of my last visit.) This is where the last Tsar actually lived and in which he and his family were imprisoned. It is being slowly restored and only about 10 rooms are available for viewing, but a visit is rewarding for those interested in the last of the Romanov families and the palace is completely free of a crowd or line! If you can speak Russian, the babushkas who sit dourly guarding each room, are actually bored as hell and will offer you an historian's wealth of info on the palace and family if you ask. They are thrilled to be asked too! And their sour faces transform as they personally guide you through \"their\" room!Do yourself a favour and spend the night in this provincial city. Book a room at the Catherine Hotel situated on the actual grounds of the Catherine Palace. It is a very, very, simple, small hotel with clean, but by no means five-star rooms. The bathrooms though are European, and once you see Russia you will understand that comment, the staff very friendly with some English, and the bar quite good. But the real reason to stay there is that YOU wake up, look out the window and see the palace and lawn directly outside. It is as if you are a humble guest of the Royal family. Really a delight. The staff can book you a taxi back to St Pete's and is happy to open the bar \"off hours\" to serve you as you wait. A lovely little place and only about 100 dollars, for two, a night. (Avoid the rather crowded restaurant next door and walk across the little yard to the tiny cafe you can see from the hotel entrance. Here you can enjoy a simple dinner at a reasonable price and the chef will try to fill your requests.)"

He was very truthful about the Palace , it origins, refurbishments , war damage and repairs.

The Palace was beautiful, and towards the end of the route through the building there are photographs of the building after it was bombed in the Second World War. Seeing these was a shock as much of the Palace has actually had to be rebuilt rather than just restored, and the work is ongoing. The result is stunning!

One may find there the Main Hall (100 sq.m. of gold and windows, reflecting in the mirrors), the Amber Chamber (worth a fortune room ALL decorated with amber), example of how they served the royal dinner and many other things.The park meanwhile is very romantic. It's cosy and charming at any time of the year, I love it so much we had a wedding photosession there. Have a look!"

Besides the beauty of the palace, the contents were amazing, the Sevres and other porcelain, the floors, ceilings, gilt. The actual palace was restored after the war they did an amazing job. It was great to see that the original contents had been removed and stored safely so they are now back in their original setting. For history buffs, this is a treasure. To see the Romanov crest on the porcelain it somehow sent shivers down the spine. We walked through the park, it was covered in snow and was snowing. It was like a fairy-tale and really beautiful.

Renovation made finding the entrance somewhat complicated - especially since it opened at noon and not the 10am that was posted. But they did a good job of line control after noon, which was nice. Make sure to walk the grounds and see the other buildings, especially (in our opinion) the Hermitage.We took the 299 minibus from Moskovskaya metro stop (which we also used for returning from Pavlovsk), which was easy and cheap both going and returning. Hint: take the first stairs on the right when leaving the metro station and cut across to the large building with the buses and vans in front \u2026 do *not* go to the stops on the main street. And you can pick up the 299 right from in front of Pavlovsk when returning."

Hermitage is far and away the winner in my estimation. Catherine Palace being a trek makes the case for it even less compelling.If you do go, you will probably enjoy yourself, and a nice plus, is the neighbourhood you walk through to get to the palace, has a very nice, local feel. We took the train, and it was rather complicated, but well worth it (rather than taking a taxi)."

We were greeted by a local brass band playing, despite the cold - so it certainly cheers the spirits! You can see a small statute to Pushkin (as we are in the town bearing his name) and you can see how he is loved due to all the flowers left in memory. The palace inside continues to amaze. St Petersburg is just packed full of incredible art and architecture and here is yet another breathtaking place. The Grand Hall is stunning, all the light from the windows and lights, coupled with incredible ceiling art and marquetry in the vast wooden floor. It can apparently be hired out for weddings too, and Elton John has played at one there - how amazing for those who can afford such luxury! The investment in the restoration work has produced a jewel\u2026 ahem\u2026 in the Amber Room restoration! The details were amazing, and we were fortunate to be able to spend some real time discovering that room and the rest of the palace as it is fairly quiet in the off season, can be a metre deep in tourists in summer. It is mind boggling to see the picture of the pre war and post war palace and the work down to restore it. As it completely burned out during the war, it is quite amazing to see how wonderfully the place has been rebuilt. Much of the interior was saved for the restoration by transporting effects to Siberia, packaged up by the ladies and children of the house as the men were involved in fighting. Go and admire it!"

The exterior is bright blue and when it was originally built the detail was adorned with gold leaf. The interior rooms on show also feature lots of gold leaf and the restoration has been painstakingly done and much of the original furniture and fittings have been saved. I thought the most interesting part of the palace was on the way out of the state rooms where the corridor is lined with photos of the saving of artefacts and the restoration of the palace. You can see photos of bare brick walls and roofless state rooms following bombing by the Germans during WW2. A total of 12021 articles were packed up and stored in the cellars of St Isaac's Cathedral to be saved for future generations.The famous Amber room is an example, nobody knows what happened to the original amber panels as there wasn't time to pack them up and remove them to safety before the Germans arrived. However the Germans did pack them up (and everything else of value in the Palace) and took them away and then they disappeared, reputedly destroyed in a fire. The restoration of the amber panels has been done from black and white photographs aided by computerising the amber colours.So, save some time to marvel at the dedication of the restorers!"

We were greeted outside in the courtyard by a band. Upon entering the palace, you knew that you were in a special place. We had to put on booties to protect the floor, and made our way up the stairs to the main ballroom. You could picture in your mind, the grand parties with prestigious guests that would have taken place here. Each room was more opulent than the next. Catherine the Great knew how to live and surrounded herself as such.The highlight of the the palace was the Amber Room. Everything made from Baltic Amber, including the walls.We were on an organized guided tour and had an in-ear microphone for explanation from our guide, which helped. Although we had an early start to the tour and there were originally a lot less people, it got crowded quickly. Seems at times we were shuffled from room to room, without stopping or any explanations.The grounds were manicured and pretty. There are food vendors where you could purchase a soft drink, or a snack.I would definitely recommend a trip to Pushkin, but try and get there early. If you can get an audio explanation to the various rooms, it greatly helps."

One stunning room after another, with excess upon excess pouring out of every surface. Consider that this palace (like Peterhof) was virtually gutted by the Nazis during WWII, and your jaw will drop still further at the meticulous reconstruction. Group tours dominate (and make movement difficult in places), but a good audioguide is available for the more independent-minded. Be aware that an entry ticket to the grounds is required before you can enter the palace itself. A truly magnificent achievement."

We got to and from by metro and bus, so it cost less than a Euro each, starting at Sennya Ploshchad metro station on the blue line southbound, and changing to a small white bus at Moskovskaya (where there is an impressive statue of Lenin on a column). Buses from the same area as the Airport buses so follow the sign for buses to the airport from the Moskoskaya metro. The driver will tell you where to get off.As it was a November weekday there was no crush, and we just walked in, bought a ticket and went round the museum at our own pace. No crowds, normally we were the only people in any one room.It is most impressive, and has many interesting things to see, not least the Amber Room and the Gardens. Unfortunately it suffers from a problem that is difficult to define but common throughout the ex-communist world, in that it is a display of static things from another time (\"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.\" - PL Hartley 1953) and so the displays actually give little idea as to what it was like to live and exist in this time and what the people did etc. Where was the Tsarist loo for instance, or the kitchen ? The museum needs to come alive; to project the times and events in a more friendly way, and not just to be a repeat of the photographs in the book. Also the labeling and signage generally is very poor, but again this is not just a problem encountered at this location.I imagine that the gardens would be beautiful in the summer, but in November are a bit bare and colourless.There is a cafe where you can get a cup of tea/coffee and a sandwich; and a cloakroom to leave your bags and overcoats.Overall well worth the visit."

The Russian rulers lived in opulence that today cannot be duplicated, by the old (the Breakers in Newport is a poor cousin) or new rich (who are the ones who would like to live like royalty but do not know how to). Russian royalty had palaces that were used as \"play grounds\", that is, no bedrooms or kitchens, but simply a place to spend the day; palaces to make a stop for lunch, etc. The Kremlin displays solid gold coaches, gowns completely encrusted with jewels, etc. By comparison, Catherine's palace and gardens are beautifully restored, with magnificently decorated rooms. I especially liked the dining table set for (what looked like 50, but I didn't count) with absolutely beautiful dinner ware. To my surprise, there was more than one such room with huge dining table and beautiful dinner service set out. This Palace is smaller than Versailles, but more tasteful and more beautiful (and I do love the French, despite their faults and my laments), although I am not a groupie of the opulence that the Royals enjoyed in France or Russia. We visited with a small tour group of 13 in July, 1998 (despite the date that this site forced me to put it from a list that did not go back to 1998---without it, I could not submit my review), and did not find it as crowded as Florence, Italy, which has the greatest collection of early, high and late Renaissance art that I have seen. The entrance fee for the Palace (if there is one) was included in our trip."

This Palace called Tsarkoe Selo is very big and I think better than Peterhof about the rooms to see inside where the best one is the magnificent Amber room(all made with elaborated amber) but also the dining room and tne big saloon are fantastic!!! There are more rooms to see respect to Peterhof and more interesting I think. From a week has also opnede the visit(only guided so you'll have to wait a lot) of the very nice Khaterina's private apartments where she lived her last days all just renewed.About the park we've seen not at its best because of winter preservation of the fountains but there's a big lake with some beutiful constructions but not comparing to Peterhof that for the gardens is unbeatable!!!"

The history, the art, the furniture, the grounds were breath taking. There is a nice little tea room for that break. Note there are two lots of toilets. Some near the cloakroom, looooong lines. Walk past the cloakroom and down a long hall there are more, no waiting. The grounds outside were beautiful. No walking on grass however!"

There are no signs and as soon as you leave St. Petersburg, nobody even remotely speaks English. So I'll use this review to guide you to the palace, assuming you're visiting St. Petersburg on your on. Btw: Queues seem to be no problem in October.First, you need to get to Vitebskii Station (Metro line 1, Pushkinskaya). Go directly to the platform level, suburban rail tickets are sold in a booth close to platform 3, not in the main ticket hall. If you ask for tickets to \"Pushkin\", you'll certainly get the correct ones; here, everybody knows where tourists want to go if they come here! Take one of the trains from platform 3 or 4, most of them go to Pushkin (ask if you're unsure).The stop you need to leave the train at is called \"Detskoye Selo\". Here, nobody speaks English - so unless you speak Russian, you can either take a cab or the bus, which is what we did. The buses in the correct direction leave from the stop the farthest to the right when you leave the station; if you want to play it save, take number 382 and don't be surprised if it's not much more than a large car. The ride is cheap at around 30 Rubles.The closest stop is Sadovaya Ulitsa. However, noone speaks English, so if you want to play it safe, look for a big sort of gate (in dark grey) to your right and get off at Parkovaya Ulitsa. There, you'll certainly feel lost as nothing points into the right direction and every building looks sort of palace-ish. Walk to the big grey gate. If you're lucky and it's off-season, it's open - then you can just enter and cross straight through the park. If not, continue walking along the road right in front of the gate, further away from the bus stop. It's Sadovaya Ulitsa. At its end, you can't miss the palace.I hope that helps - because as I wrote before, you certainly need to go here."

The two days in St. Petersburg were the highlight of our recent Baltic cruise on the Princess Ship Ocean Princess and Catherine's Palace was the highlight of St. Petersburg. We had an exclusive visit on a beautiful night in late July. We entered the gates after seeing the carriage museum and were met by colorfully dressed royal guard musicians. The first look at the palace is absolutely breathtaking. We had a tour of the palace which was very impressive and with only 90 of us there that night it was an exclusive visit that made you feel like you were really visiting at a royal invitation. The Amber Room was definitely a highlight of the visit, it was so beautiful. There was a man in one room playing a flute, in another room a harpsichordist, and the highlight was a concert in the great hall with four musicians and two actors impersonating Catherine the Great (Sophie) and Pushkin. Then they sat down and we were entertained by two dancers who truly were charming and eloquent. Then on leaving the palace we were unespectantly thrilled to see a horse drawn carriage tour around the front of the palace several times and then the charming couple got out and did a waltz. All of this was while the royal musicians played. Afterwards we were treated to a Russian Dinner and Folkloric show in a different part of the palace. The grand finale was an absolutely unbelievable sunset on the palace that made it look like it was on fire as the sun reflected off of the glass windows and the chapel spires. It was an absolutely incredible night, I don't know of any event in all of our travels of the world that left a more exhilarating delightfull impression than this memorable night."

We were in St. P for three days and by the time we had seen Hermitage, Peterhof, and Catherine Palace, we were pretty well overwhelmed by the gold leaf etc. This is another gorgeous palace and well worth the visit. The amber room is especially remarkable. Catherine Palace is outside of St. P and requires transportation of some kind. Despite my remarks, I'm glad we didn't miss this. By the way, our tour guide says there are better and less expensive places to buy amber if you're interested. Also, amber used to be available in pieces washed up on the beach. No more...now they have to send divers down to dig into the sand to find it. So new amber is more expense. Luckily for me, brown and gold are not my colors."

The Palace was built as a summer retreat for Catherine and 100 kilograms of gold were used to gild the sophisticated stucco fa\u00e7ade and numerous statues erected on the roof. In front of the palace is a great formal garden. The interior rooms (especially the amber room), furnishings and gold inlays are way over the top with extravagance. It makes one wander how the aristocracy could live this way when ordinary people starved from lack of food. We enjoyed our visit but found the crowds overwhelming, especially when the fountains were started around 11 am (see photos). Worth seeing if you know that there will be so many people, but it can get a bit tight in the grounds of the Gardens. It is a once in a life time experience to see this magnificent architecture and opulence!"

Room after room of elaborate everything - floors, ceilings, walls, furniture, decorations - many with gold. The Amber room is truly incredible, even though it is mostly a recreation. No pictures allowed in the Amber room, and there are very vigilant guards and matrons in almost every room to keep an eye on people and enforce the rules.

It's further from St Petersburg than Peterhof (mainly because the bus to Tsarskoye Selo stops everywhere, while it doesn't do as much with the Peterhof one) so allocate nearly an hour to get there from St Petersburg."

Because we can\u2019t speak or read Russian, we decided to visit this wonderful city with Shore Exclusions\u2019 Exclusive St. Petersburg Two Day Program. Additional benefits to book from this company are they are local and they take care of Russian Visa. We arrived by cruise in the early morning and started our journey around 9:00 am. The port is about 36 km (22 mile) on the south of the St. Petersburg, and it took us 70 minutes to get there. The traffic was incredible; I don\u2019t think I could drive in St. Petersburg although I have driven in many countries (both left and right hand side driving). The local drivers do not have much patience, and they drive however they like.The grand Rococo style Catherine Palace (Russian: \u0415\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446) was built for Catherine I by her husband, Peter the Great, in the village of Pushkin in 1717. It exceeds all the other palaces with its massive size and its unique decorations- Blue and white with golden deco. The stunning facade of the palace extends for over 300 m (1000 ft). It was the summer residence of the Russian tsars. We waited in line for about an hour before our group was allowed to enter. All the visitors were asked to wear the shoe cover to protect the floor. First, we went through several \u201cgolden\u201d rooms, including the largest state room in the palace - the Great Hall. It is amazing to see such a big hall, 800 m2 (8,600 ft2), with real gold decoration and mirrors. Those large windows and mirrors visually enlarge the hall, while the painted colonnade on the ceiling expands the space upwards. After that we saw the Main Staircase, the stunning Amber Room and the Picture Hall. I never visited a place with so much real gold inside and out. After we exited the Palace, we also had a chance to view some parts of the more than 6 km2 (1,500 acres) of park and gardens around the palace.Photography in the Palace is permitted with no flash and no tripod. You are not allowed to take photos in the Amber Room. We visited there in late June, and it was very crowded. If possible, you should find a less crowded season in order to enjoy all the beauties of the Palace."

Having said that, the trip is not to be missed even if only coming for the 'amber room'. The Palace is wonderful but a shame many people miss the fantastic little and inconspicuous exhibit in the corridor on the way out that shows how much was done to preserve and rebuild the palace after WWII. If you have an extra 45 min. to spare, I would recommend walking to the Alexander Palace for comparison. There, you don't have the crowds because the building is not as spectacular but provides an interesting pendant and contrast."

The park is as magnificent as the palace and should not be missed. The secret to avoiding long lines for admission is to have a private tour prearrange to purchase tickets which then only have to be picked up on arrival - no waiting. Only downside to a visit is the very large number of tour groups who tend to be loud and move as a herd, making it difficult for individual visitors to either get through or to even hear themselves talk to each other.

The old-fashioned wooden benches fill up quickly with locals who are so friendly and they make sure you get off at the right stop. Buying the train ticket is easy even if you don't speak Russian. Hand gestures and pantomime do the trick. You transfer to a bus at the Pushkin train station and voila! You're at the stop for Catherine Palace. A short walk and the beautiful blue color of the palace peaks through the trees, as well as the near-blinding gold trim around the outside of the building. The highlight is the Amber Room, where photos are forbidden, but if you can stealthly use your cellphone camera, you may get a pic or two. All the rooms have been exquisitely restored and the colors and patterns of fabrics are beautifully coordinated. The parquet flooring is also stunning, and each room has a different pattern. The tour makes you wish you could live like a tsar, and you can keep that memory by having your photo taken with a guy and gal dressed up in period costumes.Outside in the gardens, you can forget where you are as you view all the beautiful flower gardens. It's a great way to spend a day, just taking your time and strolling around. There's a small cafe that has reasonable prices (given that they could really rip you off since they're the only game in town. Don't miss this palace.

It is amazing to think that with the amount of gold adorning the place, Catherine ordered the 60 oversized statues of Atlas on the front painted bronze as a cost saving measure. Inside though it is pretty clear she spared no expense. You will walk through one gold adorned room after another each an ostentatious statement about the arrogance of power and privilege. And just when you think you can't bear to look at another gilt edged room, you glide into the amber room and say \"oh, wow.\" No photos allowed in the amber room but non flash allowed everywhere else.Travel tips. Consider a tour group to speed entry which is controlled. Large bags and long coats must be checked but the facility is spacious and the process runs pretty smooth. The place is very crowded. We were there on a Monday afternoon and it was packed but they keep the tour groups moving so despite the crowds you should get to see everything. Definitely a must see and less than an hour drive from downtown St. Pete.If you found this review helpful please click below."

The palace is open to visitors -- for a fee-- but it is all worthwhile. One cannot but be amazed by the opulence and splendour of the building. Gold is found everywhere... The symbols of Russian power and pre-eminence are on the walls, the ceilings, the doors and were meant to impress visitors to the palace. Catherine the Great was responsible for it all. She was said never to wear the same dress twice and some are on display as are objets d'art, furniture, marvellous wooden floors, paintings, etc. In sections of the palace, all visitors are compelled to wear protective overshoes (free) in order not to scuff the flooring. The surrounding gardens, done in the French style, are totally delightful and not to be missed, just like the ornate gates to the compound. A glimpse into the aristocratic world of old and beautifully preserved today..."

She wanted a modest country home (dacha). He built her a palace! Lovely gardens and lakes. But best part (for me) was hearing the a capella male quintet sing Russian songs in a building constructed for a capella singing. Catherine Palace is about an hour from St. Petersburg. Take an English-speaking guide and skip the lines! She also told me exactly where to stand to hear the best acoustics for the a capella (they don't sing there all the time, so we just lucked out!)"

There are many adjectives you could use talking about Catherine palace - breathtaking, opulent, stunning......Also the gardens are beautiful, if you\u00b4re lucky about the weather. Beneath others you can find there one small palace by Rastrelli, called \"Grotto\" with lovely inner decorations and quite often music shows. Going inside requires a lot of your patience.....unfortunately I have to say that I have never met such an ignorance as in Russian attitude to tourists....we came to the palace round 10,30 (by train from Vitebsky railway station and then with masrutka bus) and find out that the ticket office is closed and it opens at noon. We asked why? One of the staff told us that you can only go inside at 10AM and than every two hours and between, you\u00b4ll have to wait in a row, because otherwise, there\u00b4s a risk that you won\u00b4t be allowed to get in next visit....So we waited more than hour in a row to get inside - but it definitely worth it! The palace is gorgeous...one part is decorated by Rastrelli matchint the taste of Elisabeth Petrovna, the other is much austere (from the times of Catherine The Great). The amber room is magic. What was the most impressive for me, the exhibition at the end - about restoration works at palace. You just have to admire thousands of people who were able to save the objects from palace and than, after war, restore the palace into this really sparkling look."

Bring your camera and comfortable walking shoes. If you are on your own you may choose to enter the palace or the Park or both. Check the weather and organize your trip accordingly. The gardens are huge with beautiful allees and lakes, you could easily spend a day just exploring the gardens. You will see young brides with their bridal party. It is a Russian tradition to visit the most beautiful local sites to have pictures taken after the civil wedding ceremony. When we were there we were fortunate that there were singers performing in the Grotto which has wonderful acoustics. I did not see a place to eat but there must be something in the area. The palace will be very crowded but the park will give you a chance to catch your breath and envision what it would have been like in the 18th century to live on such a vast estate. Inside the palace appreciate the elaborate Russian Baroque woodwork - almost totally destroyed during WWII. What you are seeing is all carved wood and our guide explained there was only one carver - a woman who worked for years. Each gilded cherub has a different face. Enjoy the details!"

Wonderful experience, we arrived there early enough to bypass the crowds, was even able to linger in a few rooms to examine the details. We were welcomed by a band who played some classical tunes to entertain us while we were waiting for the palace to open its doors to us. The opulence is unexpected, the Tsars certainly knew how to live in those days! The highlight for me was the Amber Room, photos and videos do not do it justice ( that is one of the few rooms in the palace that photography is not allowed anyway ), you just have to be there. It's amazing how they managed to recreate it, there are a few panels near the ceiling that are not filled in with amber panels, but you can imagine what the original must have looked. The artistry is spectacular, and even with the crowds mingling in the room, there is a special feel about the room that is so awe inspiring.As mentioned earlier, photography is allowed in most of the rooms in the palace which was nice, the grounds are also very well laid out, but be warned, between the palace and the grounds, there is a lot of walking to do! You also have to leave any backpacks and coats in a cloakroom before you are allowed to tour the palace rooms."

We were told that 100 kilograms of gold was used to gild the fa\u00e7ade of the palace and the statues on the roof. The gold, set upon the iconic blue and white exterior, is truly stunning. The views of the Chapel with the gold onion domes are spectacularly beautiful.The interior of the Palace is royally opulent. While certainly the Amber Room was special and unique - and we particularly enjoyed it because we had heard its story when we were visiting Berlin, other favorites were The Great Hall, The Grand Staircase, The Portrait Hall and the Picture Hall, The Crimson and Green Rooms, and the Dining Rooms. In room after room, you will see gold that is so bright that you almost feel as though you need sunglasses! Don't forget, though, to look up and down - the ceilings and floors are equally beautiful. The Palace is so large that it is difficult to get a sense of the size of it when you are there - look for an aerial view of it on the internet. That will give you some perspective when you visit. The park was lovely and, even with tourists, seemed quite peaceful. Flowers, trees, sculpture, buildings, pools, bridges, and buildings - the park is landscape architecture at its best.While we traveled to Russia independently, we did choose to take a tour to Catherine's Palace, due to our time schedules. The tour company we used was Eclectica and it was quite good - the guide was excellent with an extensive knowledge of the Palace, Park, and Pushkin and, additionally, his English was excellent. Plus, this particular tour used a small van, rather than a large bus - so there were only 12 of us which made it very easy to hear the guide, ask questions, and have time to spend both on the tour and independently.This is definitely a \"must see\" in St. Petersburg. Touring the Palace and Park and seeing the grandeur really gives some context and clarity to Russia's history and people."

The palace was built as the summer palace for Catherine 1 and is located in the famous historical town of Tsarskoe Selo approximately 17 miles south of St Petersburg, approximately one hour's drive. The facade of the palace is magnificent and gives an immediate impression of what to expect inside. We were shown round the palace in groups and were not allowed to linger in the various rooms for very long. The rooms were breathtaking and beautifully furnished. Each room we entered was more magnificent than the previous one. The doors and parquet flooring are works of art and simply outstanding. On entering the amber room it is hard to believe that this is a reconstruction, the original having been stolen during the Second World War. The ballroom is unbelievable with gilded walls, mirrors and the most magnificent chandeliers. The gardens surrounding the palace are well laid out with many attractive features. This is a must for any visitor to St Petersburg."

At the end you see the photographs of how it was after the war and you cannot believe how they have renovated it so wonderfully. Apparently after the war there was a meeting of architects from around what is now Europe and an English architect apparently said it could never be renovated, how wrong can you be!"

Yes there were crowds round the main fountains but visit the rest of the palace gardens and try the trick fountains. we went across the stepping stones and the fountains caught us out and we got wet, great fun on a hot day. We didn't have time to visit the interior of the palace as we headed off to St Catherine's Palace."

It's hard to add anything to the descriptions of other contributors on this amazing blue, white and gold palace, with its fabulous chandeliers (and we don't usually like chandeliers!). Almost all of it is an excellent restoration, the place having been badly damaged and looted by the Nazis (there are many evocative pictures of the wrecked building in a gallery).If you go individually you'll be restricted on times and, I'm told, have to take their guided tour(s) which seem to be just in Russian(?). It will, no doubt, be very busy too.Go with a good guide (see SPB Tours that we used) and you might miss all that, and will certainly get a much better explanation in your own language. In fact, although the palace is ostensibly closed on Tuesdays it seems that SPB (and perhaps a few others?) have rights to take people in; we certainly went in with very few other people there and have photos of long hallways totally empty to prove it. Our group of 15 was the only one in the famed Amber Room (the only place you can't take photos), though I'd have loved to see the Agate Rooms too, which are still being restored (although they apparently weren't looted).To have this place almost to ourselves was a major highlight of our time in St Petersburg, and a real tribute to SPB"

However, getting there on a non-organized tour can be challenging, and then once you get there it can be difficult to figure out how to buy tickets for the park and palace. Anyways, this is what my friends and I did: 1) from st. petersburg we hired a taxi for the trip that costed a fixed price of 5200 rubles with return (sounds expensive until you compare it to the price of a tour package to get there, and is cheaper when you split with more people. The taxi waited for us for 3-4 hours to head back to St. Petersburg), 2) you must buy a ticket to enter the park grounds at the park entrance before you can enter the palace. You cannot buy tickets for the palace here. 3) Join the long line of tourists in the middle of the palace and enter into the palace to buy tickets to enter the palace. Buy an audio guide in a booth opposite of the one you bought your palace tickets. 4) Enjoy the palace!"

From the 100 or so kilogrammes of gold adorning the roof and spire to the magnificent interior, this palace is priceless and breath taking. The queues to enter can be very long, and a wait of an hour or more is normal. best to get someone to stand in line while you walk around the gardens or take a coffee in the near-by cafe."

Anywhere you stroll you will like but if possible, try to enter the Music Pavilion and hear the male trio honor us all with a couple of tunes in an acoustically perfect space. OK, the palace: Gaudy as it is (it's Russian after all) I could actually see it as livable. The decor is totally over the top, yet in good taste and comfortable. This is the most feminine palace I saw and seemed the \"happiest\" instead of trying to be the grandest. Although Empress Catherine I (not \"the Great\") originally built it, her daughter, Empress Elizabeth did a massive renovation and is responsible for most of the current structure, inside and out. (Most, not all - Catherine the Great and her son and grandson did some stuff too.) The Grand Ballroom will blow you away. The famous Amber Room is here and turned out to be totally different from what I had thought from just media coverage. The workmanship is so much more refined and detailed than I could have ever imagined. Be sure to look at the pictures of what the Nazis did to try to annihilate Catherine Palace and be amazed at what the Russians are restoring. We could learn a thing or two from them about historic preservation. The gift shop is one of the best in Russia - the stuff is very good and not cheap, but it's the real deal. The village of Puskin just outside the gates of the palace is lovely too. All in all, probably my favorite site in northern Russia."

Despite having been bombed heavily (you get to see the pictures of this), there has been extensive restoration activity taking place which takes place now and every few years they open up a new room!The Amber room was really impressive and despite being remade given that parts were totally destroyed/stolen it was fantastic to see how all the amber was worked into the room around yet more extensive mirrors.The gardens are also amazing with the mirror lakes.Toilet queues for ladies can be long so its advisable to go as you enter the palace as it takes quite a while to walk around this and the gardens.We then had a lovely traditional Russian lunch with Russian singers and dancers, all in all truly unmissable!"

We took the metro and then a bus; it was all fairly easy but you will want to have someone to write down the name of the palace in Russian for you, it might come in handy. We took bus 342 which was a minivan and we paid the driver directly (35 rubles each). The ride took about 20 minutes and its very easy to spot where you need to get off as there are loads of busses and people standing on the side :) We went on a Wednesday (be aware that it's closed on Tuesdays!) and we arrived at 11:30. They only open at 12:00 for individual visitors and we did not need to wait very long as we were inside at 12:40. You need to pay entrance for the park (otherwise you cannot enter at all) which costs 100 rubles and the entrance to the palace is 350. (Use a student card if you have one, with us it worked! Park is then only 50 and palace 180). Bags larger than 25x25 cm need to be checked in!We didn't book a tour since we usually do things on our own, however, in the end I think this visit is more worth it when you book a group tour! You just get to see MUCH more of the palace inside!! I was a little disappointed with the \"quantity\", but certainly NOT the quality!! The palace and its surroundings are just breathtaking, simply fantastic!!"

Built to compete with Marie Antoinette, Catherine The Great's palaces (this one and Peterhof) were designed emulate the opulence of Versailles. The designers achieved what they set out to achieve - absolutely breathtaking! The Amber Room was smaller than I'd expected but nonetheless impressive! Staircases and ceilings were baroque overload - simply beautiful!Top tip for wheelchair users:Just about every palace and museum in St Petersburg has the most beautifully restored parquet/inlaid floors and paper slippers/shoe covers are required to be worn by all visitors. Having hired a brand new wheelchair on board The Arcadia, we were (very fortunately) allowed to go around the Palaces because it had new, clean, light coloured wheels. People who had older, black rubber wheels on their chairs were being refused entry. You do not argue with Russian matriarchs working in Museums and Palaces!!! If you plan to visit with a wheelchair, I would highly recommend making some white towelling or cotton wheel covers that can be slipped on to protect the floor from being marked by your wheels.The male staff were very helpful and allowed us to use the goods lift between floors in Peterhof, Catherine Palace and The Hermitage but there is generally little awareness/consideration for the needs of wheelchair users in smaller places and churches. Hope this helps!"

While waiting for the gates to open we were entertained by a band of musicians, they then entered the courtyard with us when the gates were opened and continued to entertain until we enter the palace. They danced along to their redition of Swan Lake and delighted my husband by playing \"Blue Moon\" (signature tune for his football club!!). Once inside we wandered from room to room each one spectacular in their own way. I was astonished at the central heating system - huge floor to ceiling furnaces covered with blue and white delft tiles. In the beautiful gardens we wandered round and then our group were ushered into a domed building where a group of men sang \"cappella\" Russian folk songs.If visiting SPB you must visit at least one palace and Catherine Palace is a good one to choose."

We were the only people there who were not part of a much larger group (everyone else was part of one of those tours where they bus you around, 30-ish people), and I highly recommend getting a private guide to see Catherine's Palace. Like Peterhof, there aren't audioguides for you to tour on your own and it's not like each room has a description of the objects being shown. If you're not going with a guide, I don't know what you'd get out of your visit other than having looked at pretty things. Having gone with a guide, it was interesting to learn about the role it had in Russia's history, the painstaking historical renovations done after WW2, and learning more about Catherine the Great. And because we were a group of 3, not a bus of way too many, we were able to go at our own pace and spend a little more time here or go somewhat quicker in other areas. The Amber Room is the main attraction here, and I have to say to me it was rather ugly. I appreciate the detail of the room and how unique it is, but there's a reason Amber rooms aren't more popular (besides the price). Glad to have seen it, but not the best part of the palace in my opinion.The grounds are lovely, but not as interesting to walk around as those in Peterhof. If you're short on time and can only pick Catheirne's Palace or Peterhof, I would recommend Peterhof, but both are definitely worth the price of admission!As a side note, we used St. Petersburg Best Guides for our tour. We had Larisa as our guide and she was great!"

You also need to guy a ticket to the gardens before you can even line up to buy a ticket for the inside of the palace. Even after waiting an hour to get inside and then line up again to buy a ticket for the palace rooms it was still worth it! The rooms are great and you can wander through at your own pace if you just ignore the tour groupings. Just astounding gold covering everything, and in the loerr floor shows just how much restoration work has been undertaken in this palace as it was almost completely destroyed during the second world war.

Sorry if you are American but its a proper game?The interiors are typically overblown Russian with gilt in abundance, you never saw such opulence it has to be seen to be believed, although just pop down the road and at the Peterhof it's just the same. Restoration post WW2 is a marvel and a tribute to Russian craftsmanship of incredible dedication, if you see the pictures of the destruction (why do that?) and have our benefit down the years of seeing the reconstruction you realise that Russia has a real passion for it's history.The equal majesty lies in the park, the layout is English natural landscape with a little bit of tricky French thrown in, suppose they had to, but the lakes and buildings and structures give you the opportunity to spend a lot of time walking, looking and admiring.We had a double ferry ride to the Admiralty where we were treated to a lovely lunch in a building of Dutch style, good food, good day, good walks and oh yes a marvellous gallery with a line of philosopher busts and gorgeous gardens.The bath houses are also worth a visit, you see just to what extent the little darlings went to pamper themselves."

We were ready and waiting 5 minutes before then and then we waited for half an hour. We had booked this tour through Qantas on the basis that it was represented as having car or minivan transport. When the car arrived at 10:05 we were informed by the (pleasant) guide that the trip would be by bus. We had assumed this to be a minibus. The car took us to Nevskiy Prospekt and there the guide said she would get tickets and that there would be a bus at 11am. So we walked around for 25 minutes waiting for a bus. When it arrived at 11:10, instead of being a minivan type bus, it was a large tour bus complete with a loud Russian guide. We enquired how long the travel to the palace would take and our guide said it would take an hour (via Pushkin) this was the last straw: Viatour had represented that the travel time was 25 minutes by car or by mini-van and that it would be a small group. This would mean that we would arrive at around 12:30 and would only have a short time to look around before having to return. A bus-load of Russian tourists smelling strongly of cigarettes was not what was represented, so we terminated our tour forthwith. I would suggest that persons taking an English-language tour may wish to get their hotel to arrange the tour: for $400 AUD for three people this tour was expensive and should have been as represented."

Many reviewers and friends had advised us to skip this one as it is generally combined with Peterhof Palace as it would make a long day trip. After ignoring their advices and seeing the place, we felt that it was worth doing that. Unlike Winter palace, this one is airy, lights everywhere, equally opulent interiors and rather well-maintained. I believe a lot of this is a marvelous restoration since this palace was on the german side of the line during siege of stalingard (st. Petersburg) and was quite badly damaged. go is our advice if the day is sunny and not overcast."

A visit to the Catherine Palace is a truly memorable experience and it just keeps getting better all the time as more and more rooms are restored to their original finery as masterpieces of the great architects who were commission to design them. I especially like the most recent of them - a tribute to Charles Cameron who also designed and built the Cameron Gallery in the palace grounds. The Amber Room has been hailed as one of the wonders of the world and is a must for any visitor to Pushkin. After years of painstaking restoration by Turkish and Russian craftsmen, the Amber Room was finally reopened to the pubic in 2003, on the 300th anniversary of Tsarkoye Selo by President Vladimir Putin, accompanied by then German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and the 40 heads of State who were invited to St. Petersburg to celebrate its 300th birthday - in St. Petersburg, Tsarkoye Selo (Pushkin), Pavlovsk and Peterdvorets or Peterhof.

You can take photos inside with the exception of the Amber Room which is AMAZING.

The hall of mirrors makes you want to linger to appreciate how the light reflects in the mirrored walls. I only we could have lingered and toured more of the gardens. We were with a tour guide and had a limited amount of time, but the rooms in Catherine's palace are truly breathtaking. You are not permitted to photograph inside the reconstructed Amber Room, but some of the guides will allow you to turn around as you exit to take a photograph. Be prepared to don paper booties to protect the floors during your tour. Sometimes I felt a bit rushed as we moved from room to room, and there are two walkways where you must walk through and not pause at all because they are very narrow. Otherwise, just be prepared to be astonished."

This blue palace was another one destroyed during the Great Patriotic War/World War II, and here it stands today nearly restored (there are some rooms which the public does not see that are not yet restored). The hallway between the last stairwell and the end of tour gift shop show the pictures of the destroyed palace, one of which shows an unexploded ordnance in one of the rooms.All visitors must wear booties so not to scuff up the floors. Yet take a look in one of the grand rooms where the pianos are - the wooden floor is pockmarked because when they hold huge expensive parties, they do not force the women to wear booties over their high heels or put a protective floor covering down. Tour groups follow one path and see rooms individuals do not see; I am not certain if the same can be said vice versa as I have always been with a tour the times I've seen this palace.The Amber Room - no photos whatsoever! The security make sure to tell people when they see cameras out (which is fine for the rest of the palace). Some of the Amber Room is still not fully restored, and according to my guide, it might not ever be. The original room is still missing, and there are treasure hunters trying to find it. There are books about it in the souvenir shops at the end of the tour.There are bathrooms near the shops and cafe. If you go outside, you might be allowed inside by the guard. Just mention WC, and he should let you in. Otherwise, make sure you use the facilities if you must before leaving. They are free. The ride back to Saint Petersburg is 40-60 minutes, traffic pending.The gardens are immaculate, but they lack the fountains of Peterhof. The gardens are divided into sections based on the landscape design. There is a little cafe in the garden near the line for the palace. There is a souvenir place off the grounds with some vendors. One of the shops used to be free for its bathroom but now either charge 50 rubles (over $1 at the time) or allow merchandise paying customers to use it for free.There is a book about this palace, Peterhof, and other nearby palaces when they were destroyed by the Nazis during WWII. It is called \"Saving the Tsars' Palaces.\" I found it in a bookstore on Nevsky Prospect. Keep an eye out for it if you are interested in that sort of history as I did not see any books of its kind at the palaces themselves."

The palace appears to have been newly built, and I was amazed to hear that it had been all but destroyed during the second world war. All that is history however, the important issue is how wonderful the restoration has been and how it captures the essence of how the palace must have appeared in its heyday. i loved the way each room presented new and fresh delights, the heating systems being especially impressive as would be expected in a Russian winter. The Amber Room was astonishing, how could you begin to estimate the cost of that, and the incredible reception and ballrooms were equally astonishing.

We avoided the outside queues as someone from the Guide-guru office had arrived early and stood outside to save a place for us at the head of the queue (amazing service they give) but we still had to contend with a queue for the cloakroom and the sheer volume of visitors who were allowed in. Before you plan your trip, do check dates and avoid the first open day following public holidays or other additional closures; also give yourselves plenty of time to wander in the grounds, they also deserve a good couple of hours to make the most of the additional buildings and the gardens/parkland."

It was a little tough to find as I don't speak any Russian and went at it on my own, but it all worked out. Never went in the palace because in my opinion, when saving time on a vacation, go inside one Russian palace, and most others look the same (had already done Peterhof.) The palace grounds at Catherine's are amazing. The little buildings and houses are painted perfectly and laid out well. A walk around the lake on a nice summer day is a good way to relax from the business of St. Petes. Good place for a slow half or full day to just unwind and enjoy the scenery."

The driver drove at high speed through the city which most drivers appear to do, however the seatbelts didn\u2019t work so we didn\u2019t feel particularly safe. If safety is a concern for you, I would suggest you check the seatbelts before departure as the trip takes about 45 mins. The tour itself was very good and the guide informative. The grounds are vast and take at least an hour to get round. Some parts are very well maintained whilst others have been allowed to grow wild. There are many interesting buildings in the grounds and in one of them we were treated to a live performance of opera by three male singers. The inside of the palace is stunning and each room is more opulent that the last. Although there are signs that say that photography is not allowed, we were advised that we could take photographs everywhere, except for the Amber room. I would definitely recommend a visit."

            "review": "St. Petersburg - Day 1. Today I toured the Catherine and Peterhof palaces and gardens. After the Catherine Palace I thought I had seen the very most elaborate palace of all time. Then we went to the Peterhof Palace \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have believed you could outdo the Catherine Palace, but I\u2019ve seen it now with my own two eyes. You should not miss either one, both were summer palaces of the Tsars, or Czars or however you want to spell it. Tomorrow I go to the Hermitage, part of which was once the winter palace. There is so much gold leaf that I have a new name for this tour \u2013 The Gilt Trip.All kidding aside, the work that has been done here is astounding. Even more astounding than the original work, to me, is the reconstruction that has been accomplished since WWII. There are photos of the palaces after the war (I should say the shells of the palaces) and when you juxtapose those with the way they look today, the comparison is staggering. I will try to put side by side photos up another day, am running low on internet minutes \u2026 so no searching on line for post-war photos at the moment. The re-creation of these world heritage sites is breathtaking. On the one hand I can understand that the people would revolt against such extreme lavishness, so the Tsarist regime had to be overcome, on the other hand I can appreciate the beauty that remains now for all of us to enjoy. One of the very cool things about being here in St. Petersburg this time of year are the \u201cwhite nights\u201d. It\u2019s 9:00 PM now and still broad daylight. The guide told us that from the end of May until the middle of July the sun doesn\u2019t really go down, it\u2019s bright enough to read all night long if the weather is clear - that\u2019s why they call them \u201cwhite nights\u201d. My Florida magic is working and today was another clear and perfect day, weather wise. If I could bottle this weather and sell it I would be buying one of the summer palaces. Of course I would then magnanimously open the doors wide to all of my clients, but that would not be a problem; they could all take me up on my offer and there would still be rooms available.  It would take me a week just to begin to describe the manicured gardens and majestic fountains \u2013 in addition to the majestic buildings. I believe there are over a thousand fountains in the gardens just at Peterhof palace. Then there are the lush meadows, artificial lakes, miles of pathways, bronze statues \u2026 it\u2019s a tribute to imagination and beauty. It\u2019s also a LOT walking. You will be bursting with pride to hear that yes, I did my 45 minutes in the gym, even after all that walking. My feet are not bursting with pride, they are just plain bursting.We stopped for lunch and I tried borscht, and it\u2019s not bad \u2013 beet soup \u2013 but it\u2019s not going to replace Chicken Noodle-O\u2019s for me. One more thing I learned today was how to say thank you, \u201cspasiva\u201d. Sounds like \u201cspa\u201d \u2013 where you go to relax and be treated, \u201csea\u201d- near the ocean and \u201cva\u201d \u2013 while drinking vodka. Just another day at the beach!Getting close to 10 PM, sun is still up! What a magnificent trip this is.For more about this cruise please see my complete blog http://sailorscruisenews.blogspot.com."

The Amber Room was looted during the WW2 German occupation and the original decorations have never been found, making it one of the most mysterious lost artifacts of the modern era. The room has been recreated and is a nice room, but after all of the hype, perhaps I had built it up to impossible expectations.Otherwise, the palace is similar to other royal palaces. I think it\u2019s unfair to say that if you\u2019ve seen one Russian palace, you\u2019ve seen them all. Each of them has their own mind-boggling hubristic aspects that need to be seen to be believed.

The audio guide was good but sometimes gave too much detail. We spent much more time than the few tour groups that were there with us and we still cut off the audio at times."

You might have to pay through the nose for an organised tour or queue outside the palace for a while if you are a independent traveller but it is worth it. If you aren't on an organised tour you get lumped in with a group when you arrive for a tour in Russian. The audio guides are also only in Russian so if you want to know a bit more then you can get a guide book from the shop opposite the ticket booth before you enter. Once inside just make your own way around. As long as you aren't doing anything stupid or getting in the way, the staff don't seem to mind that you have 'lost' your tour!Make some time to see the gardens, some of the other buildings are almost palaces in their own right. If you have time, it's also worth getting over to the Alexander place but note that you'll have to pay again to get back into the Catherine palace gardens. The Alexander palace is in the process of being restored so you can see what the restorers have to work from. If you get the train out from St Petersburg, take a wander around the Vitebsky train station if you have time. And if you are wondering where to get tickets, head out towards the platforms and go along the right until you get to some modern ticket barriers - the ticket booth for suburban trains is here."

The Palace is just as impressive as the Winter Palace in St Petersburg with similar styling and colours. Built in 1756 it has a flamboyant Rococo style facade but the interior is simply bedazzling and lavish to the nth degree. Whereas the Winter Palace is more of a museum for works of art, this palace is great big empty ballrooms etc set up just as the lifestyle of the mid-18th century. They needed to be big to fit the dresses of the ladies of the day. One sees gold and reflections of gold in huge mirrors in most rooms. Then there's the bedchambers, dining rooms all set with displays of the finest porcelain, and the throne room plus so much more. Expect to walk for a couple of hours and continue to be in awe of just how much money and what a lavish lifestyle was held here in days gone by. Outside the gardens are in layers, with a summer house and pool, and wonderful trees. Going there with a Guide makes all the difference in the world as history is explained and you come to understand why Russia was and is the way it is, and why revolutions took place within their own country. We were lucky the place was not filled with tourists so good photos could be taken without people reflected in all the mirrors, but it was also cold and not quite the sunlight I would have liked on the exterior. I guess you get one or the other! But a \"not to be missed\" experience!"

We were welcomed by a brass band where we parked and by another at the entrance to the palace. There were a number of tour coaches when we arrived, but it is such a huge palace, that it can easily cope with swarms of visitors. First impressions were wow this place is huge. It just seems to go on and on - I think they got rather carried away on this one. Of course it is completely over the top both inside and out, but that was the how it was done if you were a Russian Emperor. The rooms we visited were incredibly ornate and possibly even more than Versailles. The famous amber room exemplifies the opulence. They obviously did not know what to do with their money and it's hardly surprising that the common people revolted. The expenditure to build this palace must have been astronomical. It then had to be fully rebuilt after WW2, as it was almost completely destroyed. There are photos of the destruction.We also wandered around the nice understated gardens. It is a wonderful palace, a world treasure and a must visit place in St P."

It is a wonderful tribute to the people of St Petersburg that the restoration has been done so accurately. Every room in the palace has its own unique story and character. From original paintings by the masters thought to chandlers that are exquisite. This is one place I will return to as it is hard to take it all in on one visit."

Leave your coat and large bags, put on your overshoes and off you go.Yes it's very impressive and it's hard to believe people lived in such lavish surroundings but what impressed us more was the standard of workmanship in restoring this ruin to it's former glory. There are photos and drawings near the end of the tour which really bring home what a mess the place was after the war. The craftsmanship really is excellent and that was our lasting impression of this palace.It was a beautiful sunny day so we walked in the grounds and were lucky enough to hit the first seasonal performance of a local choir of four men who make a wonderful sound in one of the small buildings in the grounds. The acoustics are very good and we bought one of their CDs to bring home as a souvenir. There was a flautist playing near the palace too.The whole place had a lovely, relaxed atmosphere. A nice morning out."

The carving and guilding are amasing! You feel youself in history although many items were lost during the Second World War.The palace is situated in the city named after russian poet Alexander Pushkin so it is better to read something about his life and poems. By the way when living in this city he ended the Onegin's letter to Tatiana (from Eugene Onegin):\u2026every moment seeing you,And following where\u2019er you go,Your lips that smile, your eyes that move,To catch with eyes in love, aglow.To hear and hear you, understandWith all my soul your sweet perfection,In agonies before you stand,Turn pale and swoon! What bliss! What blessing!(the translation is taken from the Internet)So, a wonderful romantic place especially in nice weather!"

I particularly liked the parquet floors of so many designs.The gardeners were working in the Park to prepare it for the summer season, and so the outdoor statues etc, were still covered by their winter boxes. However, it was warm enough to sit outside to wait for our fellow travellers to emerge. We watched the sparrows gathering bits and pieces (including a large white feather) with which to build their nests, tucked in behind the beautiful baroque decorations to the front of the building.It was a lovely trip and we were so pleased we had decided to go in April - I think it would have been much less enjoyable with the large crowds in the summer months."

We wrongly assumed we were 'palaced out\" after seeing so many richly decorated residences. However Catherine Palace is of a size and layout that gives the wow factor but also portrays how the families actually lived there. The personal dining rooms are as interesting as the magnificent ballrooms. The amber room is a must - interestingly this whole building has been restored from a shell and the amber room had to be completely recreated with fresh amber as the original was lost - at what cost! Note you are not allowed to take photos in the amber room so have to buy the postcards Outside the gardens - even now in icy cold April - are worth a visit - and the little hermitage/garden retreat will I am sure be open to visitors one day A short drive outside St Petersburg this is definitely worth making time for."

So quite a bit cheaper than the 1800rubles we were quoted for an excursion from Nevsky Prospekt.It was still low season so the grounds had only just thawed from the snow, and the lake was still frozen, however, on the plus side it was really quiet and we had the rooms to ourselves for most of the time which made enjoying the palace so much more possible.

Luckily, before the German army came, the palace staff took pain to hide the treasures away, some in St Issac. The Russians did an AMAZING job restoring the Catherine's palace. The palace showed the Russian empire at its grandest. When we arrived, there was this small brass band, band members dressed up as royal guards, welcoming the visitors. How lovely!Each room was in a different style, with decor materials from different parts of the globe. Every one was so beautiful. The amber room, though a re-creation (the original was taken down before the German army came but lost after the war) based on old sketches, was stunning. WOW!!!! What a sight!Our guide, from TJ Travel, took us through the palace and shared with us the stories and highlights of the exhibits. The palace could get very crowded with tour groups. We couldn't really take a lot of time to study each room in detail before being rushed forward by the group behind us. Be sure to arrive early. Compared to the Peterhof, the Catherine Park was ok. Nice but not impressive per se."

The great architects Rastrelli and Cameron's showplace is full of over the top large rooms with ceiling frescos and gold work galore. Also not to be missed is the recreation of the famed Amber Room that had disappeared during WWII. In 2003 they reopened it and you would not know that it is not the original as it sits in this most amazing and lovely place. We were winter visitors so did not take advantage of the garden tour in the 10 degree weather but I could see that is was large and very French in feel. The drive out is pleasant and allows you to see some upscale neighborhoods along the way with a final drive by the famous Alexander Palace (the yellow one to the right before Catherine's). A guided tour of the property would be a wise investment as there is some amazing history associated with it."

Use the three person rule. The rule: you need to ask three people to obtain the answer to one question. For us, this included finding the track, boarding the right train, and deboarding at the right station. It's an exhausting rule and a good one to remember. Park: Loved the Park. Could've walked in the snowy landscape for two hours.Palace: If you can, see this before the Hermitage because the art is not as good. Not a fair comparison, but there you have it.

It is a beautiful palace, the Amber room is just one of the highlights and is the only room you cannot take a photo. There is a park (although as it was winter and it was snowing we didn't walk around as the statues were all protected). Do not miss it."

When getting closer to it you see just a side part of the building and then when you get right on the Platz infront of it and see the majestic Golden Gates and the enormous ensemble you can appreciate the talant of its designer. Inside it is like a palace from a fairy tale - gold carvings, beautiful statues and of course breathtaking Amber room! I still remember the warmth of it's precious decoration.It is unbelievabe beautiful! I am so happy we were there during our trip. No problems by the entrance, in fact our group was entering ( I was with Tj Travel) while the others from other companies were lining up in queue. Truly speaking they really made a miracle every time when there was a line to enter - they bit all of them. So no waiting and only the most pleasant memories from this fairy tale place. it is here you believe that Russia is a land of the Fire bird!"

Catherine was a German who killed her ineffectual husband (or had him killed at least), took control of Russia for a bit and beget us the Hermitage and this little country estate. Supposedly, even she felt it was \"a bit much\", but she was a harsh critic of architecture (she leveled her Tsaritsina in Moscow and demanded it to be rebuilt from scratch) and, like me, you might find it a decent place to call home. Great walking around the estate, even (or especially) in winter. The Amber Room lives up to its hype. If you're game, get there Russian style: Metro and Marshrutka. Cheap ($2) and easy!"

Both names seem to be used. All the rooms are beautiful and the routes through the palace are designed so room to see everything properly. But I have never seen anything in any palace in Vienna, etc. like the Amber Room. The walls are covered with amber, mirrors are trimmed with amber, and it is stunning. Of course the beautiful parquet floors and china and furniture in other rooms are beautiful too, but the Amber Room is amazing. Not all the rooms have been restored, but what has been restored is worth it.The cafeteria is not what you would expect in a palace but it is fine for a cafeteria.We took a minibus from St. Petersburg (first the subway, then the minibus). We went back the palace and had to walk back (as did a couple of other tourists). So if you take the subway/minibus route, much cheaper than going by tour, see if some person on the bus can tell you where to get out for Catherine Palace. There is a line-up for Palace, but it moves along. Grounds are pleasant too."

A key to enjoying this experience is to have your own private guide and not be part of a large group. This is becuase the guide will provide you with extensive detail on the history of the palace, ensure you don't need to queue up for admission tickets and funnel you past large tour groups. The grounds at Catherine's palace are beautifully manicured and you need to spend time in the garden to see how it has been beautiful planned around getting views of the palace from the garden and from the palace to the garden. The palace has been maintained to the highest standard and is the equal of any palace you would visit in the world. The Amber room which has been restored is simply brilliant and this palace is a very imporatant piece of Russian history. You must see it when in St Petersburg"

Catherine's Summer Palace in St. Petersberg: While enjoying this Must See attraction, the Costumed Characters gave us a huge insult by turning their back and literally walking away when I turned my camera toward them. Recognizing it was customary to tip those in Costume, I was prepared and had a tip in my pocket. Obviously, their custom is to receive the tip first before providing the photo opportunity. In this instance, they lost and we lost. This really dampened our appreciation of the Russian people and all the effort put into the restoration and maintenance of this incredible historic and beautiful palace. This attitude alone knocked the Overall Rating down one point to a four. All of the other people were gracious and helpful. With that being said, Catherine's Summer Palace is a MUST SEE when visiting St. Petersberg, Russia. The extensive and outrageous use of gold covering is just stunning. The craftsmanship of all the ornamentation is all of the rooms is something to behold. Clearly a fantastic example of the difference between the Have's and the Have-Nots, at least the Have's did pay the artisans and craftspersons and provided work for the Have-Not's.Great care is taken to preserve this restoration. We attended on a rainy day and had to put on clean room footwear to protect the wood floors from deterioration due to the water tracked in.Security is very high-tech. Photography is not permitted in one of the rooms. When sensors detect a flash, or security sees a person using a camera, they are very quick to respond. We heard stories of the violator having to delete ALL images on their camera. That's a pretty high price to pay for not observing the rules.Bottom line: An excellent attraction to experience. We had our 8 & 18 yr old grandkids with us. The tour was short enough that they enjoyed it.Very educational."

If you wish to visit this most interesting palace, with the beautiful Amber Room, I would suggest hiring a guide and going by car so you can see things at your own pace. We were able to see the palace in the morning, but due to the number of summer tourists there were 2 paths, and we could only see one path with our ticket, so we could not see everything. Sort of a lotteryfor which path you are given. But at least we were not shuttled through as fast as the groups. We also enjoyed a stroll through the park, and used the audio guide for a visit to the beautiful Turkish Baths (separate admission ticket). There were many souvenir stalls outside, but our guide Sergei advised against buying from them. Overpriced. He did take us to a cafe where we could buy blinis ( russian pancakes) for a cheap and quick lunch as we walked the 10-15 minutes over to Alexander Palace. This was more interesting to me as it is less formal and fascinating to see where the last Tsar and his family lived. Also a chance to walk over to the lovely chapel that Nicholas had built nearby. Don't miss going underneath to the private room where Alexandra went to pray everyday. Then we still had time to drive to Pavlovsk to see Paul's palace."

This place, commissioned by Empress Elizabeth, was so lavish that it even took Catherine the Great aback when she ascended to the throne (by maybe icing her husband) and had a look at the books.The royal gilders were in the process of covering the statues and exterior in gold when Catherine the Great said, \"Nyet!\" but not before whole ballrooms were clad in gold. The grand Gold Ballroom has enough bling for the entire NBA roster.No wonder the Russians revolted against the perceived excesses of the Romanovs, who truly were the 1%. Or probably more like 1% of the 1%. But 21st-century tourists are the beneficiaries of this aristocratic excess. Catherine Palace, with its beautiful collections, is stunning in its details.The Nazis had headquarters here during their 872-day siege of Leningrad during World War II. When they left, the palace was in shambles and 70,000 trees in the surrounding park had been cut. Almost immediately after the war, the Russians set about restoring the palace, meticulously putting back together the pieces and re-creating from photographs such spaces as the Amber Room (the Germans dismantled the room and the original amber mosaics have never been found). As we were part of a Seabourn cruise tour group, we were able to go into the palace early, which was fantastic. We had the place to ourselves for a while. And our tour guide Marina was simply the most remarkable tour guide. She looked right out of Central Casting but her knowledge was voluminous and her English spotless.Even the drive out to Tsarskoye Selo from St. Petersburg is interesting and often beautiful. I don't know exactly what I was expecting from Russia but I know it wasn't anything as spectacular as this."

This museum had stricter rules than previous museums, we had to have plastic cover slips over our shoes and there was no photography at all. We had to be in a state of motion the whole time, we weren't meant to stop and spend a lot of time in front of one exhibition. The grounds to the palace were immense, there was so much to see. A lot of birds and squirrels were all around and the amount of fun water features could have provided entertainment for hours.

It was spectacular arriving and seeing the Palace and a band was playing near the steps as we entered. We had to wear overshoes which they supplied. It was raining the day we were there so the walks around the gardens weren't as pleasant as they should have been. The inside of the Palace was amazing BUT after you have seen the 10th room all decorated in gold and white the novelty wears off a bit! It just seemed to highlight the excesses of the time when some people had too much and others not nerly enough. We found each group was only allowed a few minutes in each room then the Russian attendants would growl at the guide and we would have to leave. We had lunch in the restaurant on the premises which was a very crowded room and very ordinary food was supplied. We were glad we saw it but we made the mistake of doing Catherine Palace and Peterhof on the same day and it was too much. Maybe just choose one!"

The off-shore trips in Tallinn, St. Petersburg, and Helsinki were all perfect, in terms of length and also for all the amenities and services. THe tour guides were very knowledgeable. The best was a young man in St. Petersburg, called Dimitri. This person is extremely well prepared and very good in meeting the needs of the clients. My wife and I, he two of us, had him with a minivan and driver for ourselves. The day was planned brilliantly. Others who took the ship's tours had to wait for as much as 45 minutes to get on the coach with 30 people. We took 5 minutes to clear the port and on our way. WE will recommend to anyone.So, thank you very much for everything."

I was contemplating to visit Peterhof but I heard that the fountains may have stopped and with the lack of time (it's a slightly longer and more expensive trip to get there), I chose to visit Catherine Palace @ Tsarskoe Selo/Pushkin instead. It was not difficult to catch a minibus/marshrutka from the Moskovskaya (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f) metro station and similarly to get back as the buses run quite regularly. To go there, I took K545 @ 35rubles and it took about 20min.. to make sure, you can simply ask the driver if he goes to Tsarskoe Selo (or point a picture of the palace!). I was lucky I had a passenger who helped remind me to get off at the next main stop and the bus driver equally waved me to the front to get off at the right stop. You can't see the palace outright, you have to take a right turn and then you will see it. It's about a 7minute walk or so towards it. Going back is easier as the buses put big signs of the station that they will be driving to, at their windows. **Tip is, the marshrutka can be in the form of a passenger van or a big bus and although they have designated bus stops, they will still stop if flagged by the street.. and when that happens, you can't really depend to count the number of stops as a measure to know when to get off.You have to pay 100rubles entrance fee which gives you access to the park grounds and an additional 320rubles to enter the interior palace itself to visit the rooms. Anyway, I arrived in time to join a group who was going to be brought into the palace so I didn't have to wait. We had to slip on these sleeves around our shoes to protect the floors and do note that the audio guides given free over the counter are only in Russian. Slipping away from the group once inside, I could go around at my own pace and overheard a few personal guides explaining to small groups and couples in English.. so I believe you can request for their services if required.Apparently no photography is allowed in the Amber Room. All the other rooms are still ornate and interesting enough to keep your finger trigger-happy on your camera though esp if it was your first time visiting this type of palace... and since I am still experiencing the beautiful fall weather, the walk around the palace and park grounds was simply amazing. It was easy to lapse into a daydream-like mode like a royalty strolling along the streams, beautiful autumn-hued trees and passing by various smaller structures scattered around the area (it's a huge area btw)To me it was worth the trip if you have a day to spare and a lovely complement to the Hermitage (which in true St Petersburg fashion, is another grand building as well, packed with more goodies of course)"

We found it quite daunting trying to work out how to get to Catherine Palace using public transport, from St Petersburg without joining a tour group that would get us there as well as being out of season.We went on the 12 October 2012. We just went as a couple. First we went to the Vitebsk Station in St Petersburg. You buy your ticket from Platform 3 which is upstairs in the main station. It is a very small ticket booth, tucked away behind the fast food outlet just before you go through the gates to the platform. It appears the ticket sellers are used to English speaking tourist - they hold up an english written set of instructions (e.g. go up the stairs) so don't be afraid to ask. Ask for a return ticket (they will offer it). It was 140R return for both of us. Walk through the scanning gates using your ticket. Platform 2 and 3 should get you there - ask general public (just show your ticket). You need to count the stations off - or like we did - time it 30 minutes as you can't understand the train announcements and there is no signage on the train. If you are observant there are kilometre signs at each train station. You get off at the 23/24th (?) kilometre mark. There is a stop at 21 km - get off at the next one. Be aware that there will be street sellars on the train. They are no problem - they don't bother you. They do there sell to the cabin and move on. The trains are old and clunky but get you there!Get off. You have an option of catching a bus. That costs about 50 R a couple. We got on one that said Palace and Parks and ended up in the middle of nowhere - Alexander Palace. Drivers and general public whilst being more friendly than the city are less confident with thier English. On the way back after our visit we just skipped the bus part, and walked to the train station. It takes roughly 30 minutes walk. You walk through the town of Pushkin which is a lovely little town. To walk FROM the train station - Walk out of train station. There is a round-about there. Take 2nd right which is Leningrad Skaya Ulitsa. Walk down it for 500 m. At 1st set of lights turn left. Walk up Oranshereynaya Ul ('up' the hill) on great footpaths - about 1.5 km. You will the park of the Catherine Palace and you can't go any further. Turn right and walk about 200 m to buy your tickets to the park (you have to pay to get into the park before you pay to get into the palace). The Palace is definately worth the trip. Similiar to Peterholf in size - beautifully restored. You can enter as an individual between 12 and 2pm. You go in as a group with a tour guide that speaks Russian - once in go on your merry way and explore as you wish. The gardens are magnificent and quite large. The cafe was very basic. If it was Summer I would strongly suggest a picnic in the gorgeous grounds. All up we spent about 1 hour in the palace and an hour looking through the gardens. Costs about 320 R each to get into the palace.It is worthwhile making the effort. Good luck!!"

Each was spectacular in their own way. If one had unlimited time one could and probably should devote a day to the buildings and grounds. The amber room was somewhat different than one might expect. Ironically my most vivid memory of our visit occurred in the Grotto. There was a small, six man a cappella choir performing as a way to sell there CDs. There is no way to describe adequately how their voices sounded in the building. They literally made the building ring with their voices. The acoustics were truly phenomenal. I bought a CD recorded elsewhere, it is good but nothing could match their performance in the Grotto building."

One can not believe the opulence of those times and the gilded, ornate exterior and then the interior rooms. The grand ball room is beyond description. This is truy a Must See if one visits the St Petersburg area and a one day side trip to remember."

You must know that you to take the train and then a bus or you can walk but it is far from the train station. It is one hour from Saint Petersburg. Tours and independent visitors can only go at sometimes. You need to have your tickets reserve. They are not easy to get. This palace is better to do it with a tour. You cannot spent more than tow houes inside the palace. You can take pictures but not in amber room. The palace is stunning. The gardens are also very nice!"

They then turn up and just walk in front of you. Every one accepts this as 'normal'.Got there by tube, train and bus- total cost about \u00a33.00. Loved the journey as we went from the deepest underground to a very CCCP style train and then a normal commuter bus. No one spoke English but a lot of people tried to help by pointing where we needed to go and telling us when to get off. They all seemed to know why we where there.The mad rush for tickets is bizarre as everyone gets in. You are only allowed in as part of a guided tour. The place is huge and stunningly beautiful. We just kept swapping tour groups as it was all in Russian so it didn't matter to us. No one was bothered so we had a leisurely look at everything. Loved it."

It is in the country and the grounds were really something. Please know that if you are on a cruise, Catherines palace,Summer palace, and trip to Pushkin are all the same. Pictures--they charge you $4 but everyone was taking them at will and nobody was checking--It was much too crowded to do so. The matrons in each room looked like they were asleep anyway.

The beautiful blue/white building is stunning to view, even before you walk through the entrance gate.There was a band playing \"where the Volga flows\", and \"The Viennese Waltz\" to keep us entertained prior to us being admitted.I was there the first week of September and it was packed with guided tours . Kind of felt like being herded like cattle. We were permitted to take photos, unlike at Peterhof. The Amber room was not permitted to be photographed.The Palace is a recreation of the original, as the Germans had destroyed it during the occupation. Some of the items are original, but many are copied replacements.You may see a lot of gold when you look at the rooms, but we were told that the gold gilded decorations were actually carvings made from local lime trees and then covered with gold dust. Only 1.5 kg of gold per room. That's kind of amazing in itself.The drive to this Palace is just past the airport. The area looked beautiful to stroll around in, but we only went to the Palace as part of the tour.We saw 23 rooms during the tour, each decorated in a unique fashion.I highly recommend visiting, even though it isn't the original building, just to get a taste for how the aristocracy of Russia lived in the 1700's."

The easiest way to get there is to take the metro to Moskovskaya (blue line towards Kupchino). Get out of any exit, and then you see a big square with a Lenin statue in the middle. Cross over the square and on the other side there are many minibus taxis. Take number 545 and after about 40min you are at the stop near the palace (ask the driver or an English speaking passanger to tell you when to get off). You just walk for about 3min up the hill and then you are at the \"Catherine Park\" ticket office. You need to buy a park ticket (100R) to be able to go to the Palace entrance for the palace ticket (320R, audioguide 150R). The entrance/ ticket office for individual tourists is open from 12-14hrs and 16-18hrs only. I arrived early and had to wait (with many others) for over an hour in the pooring rain.I would recommend arrive at/ after 12.20hrs and you can walk straight in- no que! Buy a ticket for an audioguide at the same time as the entrance ticket, and pick it up at the office on the opposite side of the corridor (ask). They take visitors only in groups of 25 people through the palace (with a guide & earpiece- in Russian!). So use your audioguide instead of the earpice and you'll be fine. The park and lakes around the palace are also worth a visit!"

When tourists like myself plop down excessive wads of cash to catch a glimpse of Russia today, the country likes to put its best foot forward. The Hermitage notwithstanding, Catherine the Great had some pretty great digs. Even if you've seen pictures and have a fair idea what to expect, the effect of \"way too much\" and \"over the top\" is eye-popping. If you like gold leaf, if you like amber (the semi-precious stone, not the hue), if you like Russian Rococo, the 18th century architecture, turquoise (the hue, not the stone), and decadent ostentation, you're gonna love the summer home of Russia's Empress Catherine II. To appreciate her palace, you need to have some appreciation of Catherine. She was born in 1729 and lived to the ripe old age (for the time) of 67. Though born a commoner, and illiterate all her life, she took to empressing quite well. She ruled Russia with grace, charm, and most of all, enlightened intelligence for the next 34 years. Catherine's Palace, located in the Saint Petersburg suburb of Puskin, is an architectural portrait of Catherine II as vivid as Torrelli's painted posthumous coronation extravaganza. Remodeling and rebuilding upon the efforts of her mother-in-law, Elizabeth, the palace has a decidedly feminine aura, unlike the older Peterhof Palace which seems more masculine. This is especially notable inside both structures. Though the Peterhof Palace is sometimes referred to as the \"Russian Versailles,\" the architectural influence of the French residential confection of Louis XIV is every bit as much evidenced in Catherine's version. Anything that didn't move was liable to receive a layer of gold leaf, an affectation Catherine seems to have acquired from Elizabeth. The palace, its lavish interiors, the well-ordered grounds, the fountains, the statuary, and the lovely shade of turquoise blue we see today is not that of Catherine II. It's all restoration. As with the Peterhof Palace, the Nazis, as they laid siege to Saint Petersburg (then Leningrad) during WW II were not kind to Catherine's creation. By the end of the war, both palaces were bombed out, burned out hulks. Some of their riches had been hidden, even buried on the palace grounds, but Hitler's hoard went out of their way to destroy that which they couldn't carry off. One example, the Amber Room, simply disappeared, never to be seen again. The Russians began restoration immediately after the war and have been working on the project ever since. The Amber Room today is a total, though fairly accurate, recreation. The Russians have lavished millions upon million of rubles upon their restroration efforts, probably as much or more than that which Catherine herself expended. The results are impressive, and along with the Peterhof and the Hermitage, no doubt largely responsible for Saint Petersburg being the number one tourist attraction in all Russia."

When the palace opened the guards opened up one small gate and the huge crowd formed a funnel as we all tried to squeeze through one small gate. The crowd was civil, but no one wanted to give up their space as we literally inched toward the gate. Once through the gate you got in another line with your tour group. Depending on how many were in your tour group depended on where you got in line. There was a pecking order and the tour guides kept each other in check. Our guide told us that If you were a small group you end up getting absorbed into a bigger group for entrance. Then the groups split and travel at their own pace. Once again, being absorbed in to bigger groups going through security and from room to room in the palace. When I thought our line was bad I looked outside and saw everyone in the line on the other side of the palace that were individuals without tour groups. Mariana, our guide, was wonderful. She helped us check our bags and coats and find the restroom. Her commentary on the history of the palace, the art work and the people who had lived there was excellent. After the palace we enjoyed a walk the gardens. There were kiosks in the park selling drinks, ice cream and candy. There was one garden just outside of the palace where, if you stepped off the path on to the grass, there was a guard there that would blow his whistle. I felt this site was a must see and was worth the time, braving the crowds and the guard with the whistle to see."

            "review": "If you've seen the Hermitage, this is a not anything special. Even the famed Amber Room isn't really anything special. First, there are far to many people wanting to get in. Then, they've changed the schedule so that individuals are allowed in from 12 to 2 and 4 to 6. Groups only from 10 to 12 and 2 to 4. We arrived just after 2 (14:00) and had to wait in line for 2 hours. Fortunately it was a beautiful day. Then they let people in in droves, batching them into groups each with a guide, who speaks into a microphone. Each member of the group, of about 40 people, has a little earset tuned to that group's guide. The guide only talks in Russian, if you only speak a different language, you're out of luck. Plus half the earsets in our group didn't work anyway.Luckily we had our own private guide whose headset did work so he could tell what was being said, which wasn't that interesting.The rooms are much smaller than those at the Hermitage, although the building is still HUGE, and strung together like pearls. One or two are splenderfous, the others just very pretty or even rather plain.Then there is the Amber Room. All the amber was stolen by the Germans when retreating in WW II. 10 years ago the German government paid $9 million to replace the stolen amber (the original's whereabouts is unknown) and the Russian government returned some artwork stolen from Germany. All to no great avail. No plans or photos exist of how the room originally looked so they just covered all the surfaces with slices of amber, and built up picture frames of amber, etc. The room is small and not nearly as grandiose as one would think.Coupled with the crushing masses of tourists and the long lines, Catherine's Palace isn't worth the time and hassle, particularly if you've seen The Hermitage, against which it pales in comparison.Actually the best thing about it are the gold cupolas at one end, over the chapel (which isn't on the tour). Not nearly as large as those on full size churches, on a sunny day they are gorgeous."

It is the summer residence of the Russian Tsars. More than 100 kilograms of gold were used to gild the stucco facade and statues on the roof complimenting the blue and white color of the palace. Noticeable are the blue and white tiled stove in each corner of most rooms. It was once a venue of Elton John's concert and dinner hosted with famous statemen.The most impressive was the amber room. It was originally panelled with amber mosaics from Konigsberg Castle. It was presented to Peter the Great by Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia as a gift. in 1941, German troops occupied Tsarskoe Selo and dismantled the amber room in 36 hrs. and shipped the amber back to Konigsberg. Restoration of the amber room started in 1982, costs 12M usd, took 20 years to finish.Worth mentioning also is the park. Our tour guide took us for a walk and we had a wonderful time.There is an outdoor cafe where you can stop for lunch or coffee break.Tips: Lines are long, an early start of a guided tour is a must."

Looking at this palace, which eclipses Versailles, it is difficult to imagine that it was used as a Nazi military depot during the siege of Leningrad. The grounds of the palace are lovely as well however the interior is dazzling - acres of gold everywhere. Catherine certainly knew how to create rooms to impress her visitors! The drive to and from the palace offered yet another glimpse of how modern day Russia is lived - and it provided a chance to imagine what the siege must have been like over 900 days during the Second World War."

Stuuningly beautiful, the palace even has a complete room entirely fashioned in multi-colored amber, which has a value beyond imagination. Gold, paintings, chandeliers, woodwork, ceramics, art objects, furniture, antique clocks, and much more speak to the life-style of the czars. More than once I heard a visitor say what I, also, observed - it's no wonder the people revolted and threw them out."

            "review": "Impressive!. This is the summer residence of the Russian tsars and the palace is huge and looks like something out of a fairy tale. There is also a huge park around the palace divided into a formal garden French style and a wllder English-style garden. Do take the time to stroll around in the park and look at all the smaller buildings and statues. There are plenty of benches to rest your feet if you get tired and you can also buy drinks, ice-cream etc. There is also a restaurant at the back of the palace which I never visited, though. You have to pay 100 rubles at the entrance of the park to get in and if you want to get into the palace you have to buy another ticket inside the palace. Usually there a long queues to get in! I had to queue for two hours on a weekday in July when I arrived at 10 in the morning (that's when they open the palace for visitors). After half an hour's waiting I learnt that guided groups go in first from another entrance at the back of the palace and visitors on their own have to wait until 12 to be let in. There might be information about this outside the park but the information there was only in Russian.All in all the staff around the park and the palace speak very little English, if any, and are not very helpful. When I finally got into the palace I saw a lot of audio guides but they were only in Russian so before visiting it is a good idea to get some background information about the palace - it will make the experience more interesting. The rooms are of course very beautiful and you are allowed to take pictures without paying anything extra except in the Amber Room where you are not allowed to take any pictures at all. As I visited in the summer there were a lot of guided groups crowding up the palace which made the experience less pleasant than it could have been but I definitely do not regret queuing those two long hours to get in."

Make sure you retrieve them from the cloakroom before proceeding to the grounds. I didn't realise this, which lead to great drama involving barefoot running (inappropriate sandals) and begging to retain my bag - trust me - it's not worth it - get your bag before going to the gardens.

Marina was very adept to get us through and without damage to us or the gate. I strongly advise taking a tour guide because this and Paul's palace are in Pushkin - 30 km at least outside of the city. We spent a delightful time going through the various rooms that were of rococo influence. Since amber was a big fashion item back in the day an entire room (no photos allowed) was created with amazing detail However, as with Peterhof, much of the palace was damaged, pillaged, and artwork/furniture stolen by the Germans. The amber room is recreated.as is much of the palace but a masterful job none the less. We didn't see much of the gardens. because we saw the fabulous gardens at Peterhof and wanted to spend more time at Paul's Palace which I liked the best (see review)"

Having seen this palace and Versailles within six months of each other, I felt quite knocked out by the Catherine Palace and Park.Interior rooms are shaped like Versailles but an overwelming dislay of baroque and roccoco until you get to the calmer style of James Cameron. However, I felt it lacked the delicacy of Versailles.The Gardens were quite woonderful - a small lake with pavillions and stables. More relaxed in shape and planting than the Versailes gardens. The best peonies I have ever seen.Give yourself lots of time.Good cloakroom, washroom, shop facilities."

One of our favorite tours was the tour to the palace of Catherine the Great in Pushkin. As everyone else has mentioned, it is very crowded!!! So definitely go early in the day. As you arrive, you must check your coat and umbrella. Yes, you will most likely encounter rain! If you are lucky as we were, you might be the first group allowed inside the palace. It was wonderful to see the rooms empty of visitors as you first enter. Then as you look back, the entire palace is filled with visitors as far as you can see! It's hard to find the right words to describe the palace. Unbelievable, spectacular, and impressive are a few that come to mind. You will take lots and lots of photos! The process of retrieving our coats and umbrellas was very efficient. Less than 2 minutes! The walk in the gardens was lovely, even if it was raining a bit. This is a very popular attraction and not to be missed! Go early and be prepared for crowds! Also, don't forget an umbrella on your visit to St. Petersburg."

I do recommend arriving at the grounds first thing in the morning like 9am and enjoy the beautiful Catherine Park before everyone lands at the venue. We were amongst the first to get in and did not have to be in line. Really amazed by the level of details and ornate-ness of all the rooms, especially after learning that the entire place was almost destroyed during the WWII and efforts taken to restore the place to its former glory, so definitely take the time to appreciate the photos at the basement\u2013 I was touched by the commitment as the German troops basically set the entire place in fire in 1944. Apparently, one loyal palace staff managed to bury and hide a large number of the artworks etc. I also enjoyed the porcelains for the various dining tables - very intricate. One more tip \u2013 as you walk to the back of the palace into gardens, there is white building near the lake. Try to get inside and check out if there is a small tenor performance of about 5min. The acoustic of the building was superb. I prefer the Catherine Palace to the Petrodvorets as the contents of the palace feel more personal and perhaps it was a more intimate atmosphere; both interior and external grounds."

By the way, there is a McDonallds just oposite to the railway station and you could enjoy some coffee and burger on the way to Pushkin. Take a train and after 25-30 minutes you will come to Pushkin railway station which is cosy, yellow and nice. Do not hesitate to take a taxi - town is really small and you woun't go out of budget. I recommend this way because you would be able to spend more time at the park around the palace which is nice itself. At the same time you can visit the palace without any rush and mess from the guide and other group members, moreover, if you like, you can visit Licey (the school where Russian most famous poet Pushkin studied) - it is close to the Catherine palace and for some people this visit could be attractive.I suppose that it is much more efficient to organize the trip to Pushkin yourself and plan your day."

While the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg is a fantastic art museum, the Summer Palace is more like a Tsar's palace would have been before the revolution. The palace and grounds are overwhelmingly beautiful. The amber room is worth a visit on it's own while the furnishings throughout give an idea of what life was like for the royal family.Yes, much has been restored and that is a good thing. In a basement corridor are wartime photos that show much of the damage that occurred here on the Leningrad front when the German army occupied the palace. Lots of fighting took place here and restoration was necessary to bring it back so visitors can see what life was like before the revolution.The visit here was one of my top experiences in Russia."

At least it wasn't much. Then we went into the section (paid again, but very nominal fee) of the Alexander Palace where the ROmanov family exhibit was. This was very, very interesting. I wish we had rented the audioguide for this section, although there was reasonably good explanations in English. The Alexander Palace had very few visitors and was not clearly marked for where to enter for what. No one spoke English at the ticket booths here.In April, we were able to walk right up to both palaces and buy tickets for immediate entry and walk through at our own pace."

If possible, try to arrive before 10am, which is when the fountains are activated. Outside the gates of the palace, vendors set up and hawk everything from soft drinks to matroshkas.

Of course there were other tourists at the same time, but we were so few people in a huge place that it was impossible to fill a room and there was no sense in making a queue.I took a bus from Saint Petersburg, at the stop located behing the Lenin monument. I arrived there by 11 AM and before the visit I went to the cafe, as I hadn't had breakfast. It was ok because I wasn't too hungry but I needed to eat, but I can't say \"wow! I recommend this cafe\".I don't remember if I payed extra or if the permission to take pictures was included in the entrance ticket. Well, I could take a lot of them in almost every room, except in the Amber Room. It is really fantastic! After the visit I bought a postcard collection of the Amber Room just to have the photos.The bad thing was not having an audioguide to explain the details during the visit, listening to some music in the background. I like this stuff and I missed it.It was possible to walk in the gardens, although there were no flowers to see and all the other buildings in Catherine complex were closed. The visit in winter can be made in half day.I uploaded some photos of my trip to help people who intend to go there in winter. I usually travel in winter, so I know how scarce is the information about the touristic sites for this time of the year. The air was pleasantly fresh and the snow made it beautifully russian!There is a tip that I'd like to share: at the touristic information office I was told that in winter it is worthier going to Catherine Palace rather than Peterhof, because the fontains in Peterhof don't work during the winter."

Go behind the square and you will find numerous marshrukta minibuses, you can use K286, K287, K299 or K342. We paid a further 25 roubles each for the35 minute trip (did need to get the driver to let us know when to get of as was not obvious). The bus stopped at top of a road opposit the Park, the return stop was on the same road we came up approximatelly 100 yards on the other side, our return bus (same numbers) only went to 'Metro' which was shopping center so picked up the underground there, Kupchino. The Catherine Palace was fantastic, a stunning example of baroque architecture. We wanderred around the inside on our own admirring the the beautiful interior and furnishings, The Great Hall was particularlly inspirring (remanisant of the Hall of Mirrors at Versaille - sort of).

Located well outside the city, it can take a very long time to get there and back during periods of high traffic. Once there, the lines are spectacularly long in high season, the rooms are tightly crammed, and there is far less open to the public than one might think given the immense size of the palace. The grounds are very interesting as are some of the other buildings. Consider this a daytrip; and if your time in St. Petersburg is limited, visit other places in the city first."

Unfortunately we only spent a half day here, as we could have easily kept busy the entire day. The palace and grounds are absolutely beautiful. The interior of the palace is like being in a movie. You truly get a sense of how lavish a lifestyle they lived when walking through the various rooms. Of course, when you also take into consideration the masses were starving, you also understand the fall of the Romanov's. Every room in the palace is like a piece of art, and the famous Amber Room is a piece of art. There is so much more to Tsarskoye Selo, and we regret we didn't have more time here."

A huge amount of gold was used to gild the inner details and fa\u00e7ade. In the Amber Room you admire dozens of shades of this natural material and craftsmanship of the creators and restorers.After the excursion you can have a rest in the beautiful park \u2013 take a boat or relax in the shady alleys.

It takes as long as by bus and you you\u2019ll have an unlimited time to explore the Palace. The more so because, the lyceum where Pushkin was educated is situated next to Catherine Palace."

But the good thing of joining the local tour is you could avoid the hassles of travelling to Tsarskoye Selo through public transport. Apparently it's complicated. Also, you could avoid wasting time on queuing, there is only limited time session open for public (not in tour). I visit both Alexander Palace and Catherine Palace. They are walking distance to each other. Catherine Palace is really impressive!!!! Also, the AMBER ROOM is another must!!!

As you wait for your time-slot after purchasing your tickets you will notice some groups going in directly; so if you can be part of a group which has purchased tickets ahead of time -otherwise you could be waiting an extra half-hour listening to the dancing marching band at the front steps.Inside it's handy to have a tour guide, not only for the information on the artwork and historical background you are seeing, but also to navigate the maze of rooms and passages in the most efficient way possible. We had to divert a couple of times to avoid over-crowded rooms that we saw later. People management is a major concern, so you definitely need a guide. Wear comfortable shoes and dress cooly since there is no air conditioning and lots of stairs to climb. Get a pick of tourists putting on booties to protect the floor - an interesting story, but once you see the wood & marble inlaid floors you'll see why that's necessary.One disappointment is that photos are not permitted in either the amber room - but see them at whatever extra cost since the contents are astounding. Another good photo tip is to set your digital camera to 'no flash' and stability/shake control. Natural light gives much better pictures, flash photography annoys everyone with little real advantage, and you can always adjust the pics later with software. It would also be handy to have a voice recorder to match up with the pics, since you will want to remember a lot of what you see when you get home. Having a bottle of water with you is also a good idea. Tip your tour guide generously because these knowledgeable people make very little for very hard work."

Both are summer palaces, both are supposed to be beautiful, but we were so glad we visited Catherine IIs because we are particularly interested in elegant INTERIORS. The Peterhof is better for the gardens/fountains.I'd consider the interior here just a touch short of Versaille. Versaille is so perfect, perfectly restored, high quality silks drapes/walltreatments, etc etc. Here the drapers were polyester, but the gold gilding, the paintains, the ornate floors, etc were all great. And the gardens were still very nice. I'd also say the interior here was notably better than the Hermitage - if you can do just 1, do this over the Hermitage.BTW - get a guide - I've written a review for guide gurus who set ours up. It saved us a lot of time (we didn't have to wait in any lines).Also be aware that entry times are limited - certain times for singles (non-guided) others for guided groups, so be sure to check that before you go."

I think it is very representative of the flamboyance of the Russian palace, in particular, the overwhelming element of gold. The interior of the building is heavily gilded. Being a Chinese myself, I love gold (kind of Chinese tradition - means wealth) and I don't find it oppressive as the craftsmanship was really refined and delicate. It was only a bit dazzling to look at after you were led from one room to another. The chambers, however, are not all the same. They have themes and purposes and I was happy to see some Chinese elements in a few rooms. The highlight of the visit was the Amber room (NO photo only in this room). This is really a national treasure. The interior of the chamber was covered and decorated by amber stones of different colours. It was really sensational and mind-blowing to see the subtle lights radiating from different corners of the room and you feel like standing inside a box made of precious jewels. It was a pity to learn from our guide that the original Amber room (which was a gift from another country) was lost during WWII. The present Amber room is a replicate...yet the stones are all real. We were also told that the original Amber room was even more glamorous because of the high quality of stones available in the old days.You cannot stay too long in the room because of the heavy 'traffic' behind. Nevertheless, it really 'opened' my eyes and it is something that makes this visit unforgettable. I visited there in late May but there were already crowds of tourists. I am glad that I joined a group tour so that no time will be wasted queuing up for tickets or lining up to go inside. Remember that there were not much English signs (perhaps.. 'Exit' and 'Toilet\" are the only frequently seen words in some but not all tourist spots) nor English explanatory notes on spots of interest. If you go by yourself + cannot speak Russian, you are going to waste a lot of time sorting out things. The soothing colour of light blue and white on the outside of Catherine Palace is merely a disguise to the hidden passion inside the gilded rooms. Catherine is really unforgettable."

It's easy to get \"palaced-out\" if you visit a couple of the ornate palaces in St. Petersburg, so visit this one early--you don't want to be jaded as you walk around the state rooms. They can be a bit overwhelming...the amount of gilt-work and rococo swirls start to get oppressive after awhile.Fewer rooms are open during high season, to try to keep the crowds moving; visiting in Winter, our guide said, can be better since more of the living spaces are open. Be prepared for crowds, of course. This is a very popular place. Huge tour groups tend to dominate every space inside, and if you are in a smaller group, or trying to linger in a room to look around, it can be hard. It's worth hiring a guide or joining a day-trip tour in order to have the advantage of being \"in a tour\" -- being a solo visitor can mean long waits. Shoe covers are mandatory, and while photography is allowed inside in most other rooms, it is not allowed in the Amber Room. Getting pictures without crowds can be a problem, but it can be done if you're patient. (If you're like me, you don't like vacation pictures with hundreds of strangers in therm!) I mostly noticed the noise level, though -- tour guides talking loudly, people listening to audio headsets, etc. It's part and parcel of a very crowded tourist site, though.Having a local guide explain the history of the building and the restoration of the palace, and the significance of the art rooms and various differing styles that appear in the palace was absolutely worth it--and having a guide for just a couple, so we could ask questions and really focus on what interested us, was great.A visit to the palace should be included in any trip to St. Petersburg--it is one of the best examples around."

            "review": "easy to get there on your own, not so easy to get in. The review by veresch on Jan 12 2011 is spot on. The only thing to add is advise on the ease of getting there from St Petersburg. Take the metro to Moskovskaya station on Line 2. Exit the station and look for the large soviet looking building (it stands out). You may be right next to the building or have a short walk depending on which exit you use at the station. There are buses and cabs (these are mini-vans). Look for K-342. This shared ride will take you there. It will make some stops in the local area and then on the highway before arriving in Pushkin. Look out the right side and when you pass Alexander palace you are seconds away from arriving at Catherine palace. The ride is 30 rubles. Do not follow the tour groups to the palace gate, go down the street with the kiosks, make a left, and buy a ticket to the park. Enter here and then queue for the palace on this side of the palace. Go back to the same street corner you were dropped off at, when you see K-342 stick out your hand and pay the driver another 30Rubles. After driving down the highway the cab stops at Kupchino metro station. You can get off here or wait until Moskovskaya. Kupchino is on the same line. If you visit Alexander palace, the cloak room is downstairs, next to the toilet. You must drop your bags and purse and then put on show covers before entering the palace. Cab 545 is also supposed to work as well, but we only used 342. It is easy and cheap."

Just the 2 of us, the guide & the driver. was well worth the money. $7000 rubles. Tour was four hours. However, if you are visiting in the summer I would suggest an all day tour. the palace & gardens were a beautiful winter wonderland when I was there, so can only imagine how beautiful the gardens would look without snow. It was very beautiful covered in snow. One thing, be careful using your credit card. The souvenir shop at the palace was the only place I used mine on the whole trip to Russia & after I got home, 2 weeks later, the credit card coy advised me that my card had been compromised. Could have been a coincidence I guess."

To get to this attraction of the world renown is not an easy task - commuter trains are not regular, there's no regular bus service of proper quality, there are only minibuses which can be found after reaching Moskovskaya metro station in the square behind a huge monument to Lenin and in front of a big official building with Soviet hammer and sickle at the top.The palace's working schedule is something quite irregular: in high season individuals enter from the garden side at 12-14 and 16-17 hours - but in case there are no groups coming from the other side (whom you do not see) - they may open doors earlier; they may not open doors for individuals at all in case too many prearranged groups are to come or a cruise ship being late or in case of a government event to take place or because of a preparation for a government event. The palace's official days off at any season - every Monday and last Tuesday of every month but for groups they may open the doors even in these days.In case you managed to enter - you get your tickets inside and then you are to leave at their check room (left of the individual entrance) your overcoats/raincoats/wet umbrellas/ bags bigger than 1 ft/ knapsacks. Before getting to a turnstile you are to pass through a frame like in the airport, in case you need to escape it due to health reasons (pacemakers etc) - it is possible to do but you should provide a sign to a security attendant near the frame.In a room where you are to put on protective bags on your shoes for the sake of parquets (after the turnstile) they form groups to go with Russian-speaking guides. No substitution for non-Russian speakers at this time, no audio guides, hardly any English-speaking guides with their tourists can be found to join them, no information (or almost no) in the halls - so, try to prepare yourself in advance. There are 2 routes - but usually only one is provided for individuals, through the Golden enfilade of rooms. Sometimes, in case of a big amount of individuals - they can divide them and to send part of the line to the second route where you see only 2 main iteriors - the Big hall and the Amber room while the rest of the barogue Golden enfilade you will not see.There have been no elevators for wheelchairs so far (though they have spoken about its installation) -but sometimes handicapped people can get to the main second floor being in a group ready to take them upstairs and then downstairs. I have participated in such events twice myself with my tourists eager to see the palace but not being able to get out of a wheelchair. Strollers can be taken upstairs as well - at your risk.The cafe at the palace is overpriced, its coffee is definitely not worth what they charge - and honestly speaking no good places in the surroundings can be found, water even outside the garden is almost triple regular price,so you are supposed to enjoy the beauty and splendour of the palace and the garden around coming filled in advance.But - putting aside all these possible problems - the place is definitely worth seeing."

It is very quite and beautiful and it is so relaxing to walk through park's paths and feed squirrels. Beside the park itself there are also a lot of tourist attractions. For example, Catherine Palace that is on my mind one of the most luxurious palaces in the world. And the gem of this palace is world known Amber Room. It is impossible to describe the splendors of this room, it just must be visited. So, do not spare one day from your trip and visit Tsarskoye Selo; believe me it is worth visiting."

            "review": "Very impressive and very crowded. The Catherine Palace is by far the most crowded sight in St Petersburg, so the best way to get there is with an organized tour, especially if you come in the summer time. This will save you time that otherwise you will have to spend lining up to enter the palace.If, however, you do decide to visit the palace on your own, remember that during the high season (May through September) individual visitors are admitted between 12 o\u2019clock and 2:00 p.m. and then between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. Although the palace opens at 10 o\u2019clock, the rest of the entrance time is allocated to organized tours.The palace is actually in the countryside (about 20 km to the south of St Petersburg), so the drive there from the city center takes at least an hour. If you are determined to use public transport, take the subway to Moskovskaya station, and then a minibus (No. 342 or 545) to the palace. Using minibuses is a challenge in Russia unless you can speak some Russian because most drivers speak neither English nor any other language spoken in West Europe, so make sure you find out in advance exactly where to get on the bus and where to get off.The entrance for individual visitors is from the garden side of the palace. The booking offices are inside the palace. Before you go through the turnstiles, make sure you check your overcoats and bigger-sized bags in the cloakroom (no cloakroom charge) as these are not allowed in the palace rooms.There is an endless flow of tourist groups through the palace rooms, so if you want a tour, it is usually fairly easy to pick up a group that speaks your language and to listen in to the tour guide\u2019s explanations.Because the palace tends to get overcrowded, they close up part of it during the high season to speed up the traffic, so if you come then, you are most likely to see just the famous \u201cGolden Suite\u201d of reception rooms designed by Rastrelli, which includes the unique Amber Room. The rest of the year, when the place is not as crowded, you might have a chance to see the living rooms as well.No flash photography is allowed in the palace, and there is a total ban on photography in the Amber Room (apparently introduced to prevent people from staying there for hours taking photographs). For those who want a picture of the Amber Room, there is a bookstore downstairs that sells separate booklets of this room as well as sets of postcards and books of the palace interiors.The Catherine Park around the palace has quite a few interesting and beautiful pavilions, so leave half an hour to walk around and admire the scenery. There is a small coffee shop inside the palace, and on a fine day, it is worthwhile to have a short rest in the open-air caf\u00e9 in the garden in front of the palace."

And so it was. We checked the web page the day before and there was no warning abut that. So if you really want to see the Amber Room and the palace interiors, do call them ahead or plan for a second, back-up visit in Pushkin. Ordering a guided tour might help, too...The Museum's web page is really useful when planning your trip - it lists many options of travel, including the Marshrutka or bus from St. Petersburg. While the former (which is a privately-owned mini-bus) is a cheap and fast (and sometimes furious) option, the later is a bit tiring as the bus is usually full and drives around the town for about half an hour.In addition to the palace itself, there are two parks in the immediate surrounding. The one in front of the building is paid (a separate ticket is required), while the one behind the palace (containing chinese pagodas among other stuff) is free. It's a nice place for a walk if you have time - it may take from 30 mins to a couple of hours, you can also meet locals doing a BBQ or sunbathing in some areas.All in all, it's a days trip from St Petersburg but it's definitely worth it."

We travelled out on a mini bus which was fine. Our guide had perfeect English and was very informative. There is something odd going odd at this time (June 2009) between the locals, the police and the tours and we were told to be ready to leave the bus in a hurry when our driver got a parking spot. On gently pushing the guide as to what was going on he explained that Pushkin is a very upmarket area, the locals are not interested in their roads being clogged up with tourists and tour busses so they bribe the police to fine the drivers for parking etc. The tour groups in turn bribe the police to look the other way and so it goes on. When we were there the locals had upped the ante! We had to phone the driver and arrange a pick up spot etc on the way back too. Bizarre! Particularly given the many hundreds of acres available to create a car park witout even impinging on the palace.Anyhow the palace is extremely impressive outside with its 300 metre span and gold statues. Inside is equally impressive. It is trully very lavish, with gold everywhere. As it was destroyed during WWII they have done an incredible job on restoration. The famous Amber room is of course a copy as the original disappeared during the WWII German occupation. The whole palace is just amazing and very over the top in it's baroque style. One can't help thinking of the poor peasants starving while the tsars lived in such lavish palaces! No wonder they rose up! Catherines private rooms / wing is still under renovation. But you can see a lot of the rooms in the main run of the Palace. Well well worth a visit. If you can get around the gardens at all too they are pretty impressive though obviously not on a par with Peterhof."

We went on our own. First with the metro to metro station moskovskaya , from there you can pick a few minibuses (286, 287, 299, 342, 32 Rubles pp). But then we encountered a strange phenomenon. Before the palace was a queue of some 30-40 people. The door was closed and there was no ticket booth. We stood in line for some time, and we gradually came up front because some of the people moved out of the queue. Then we heard from some russians that the doors opened at 16:00, and it was just 14:15! It seems that the doors openend for individuals at 14:00 and 16:00 (in the morning 10:00 and 12:00 I believe). Then we walked around in the park en we got back in line at 15:30 at -10 degree celcius! At exactly 16:00 the doors opened and there was a rush of russian people heading forward, climbing the fence, pushing like there was some kind of disaster happening! Fortunately, we were in the second group to enter the palace, which was beautiful. You are assigned to a russian tour guide, which you can easily leave to go your own way. Tickets you can by in the palace for +/- 550 Rubles."

Just seeing the Amber room will make your visit worthwhile.Make sure to walk the grounds around the park! The park is beautiful.For those travelers that have to chose between Peterhof and Catherine Palace, I would suggest going to Catherine Palace if you have seen Palace of Versailles outside of Paris.I think Tsarskoye Selo give you much better feel for a \"Russian\" palace vs. the more eleborate Russian copy of the French Versailles - Peterhof. (The fountains and the gardens of Peterhoff are much more impressive then Versailles so don't get me wrong) Althought I was visiting St. Petersburg in the end of Septemer, Peterhof was crowded. Buses and buses of tourists. Tsarskoye Selo was not crowded at all. Mostly locals were visiting the park.Getting to the place was not hard at all. As other posts mention, taking the metro to Moskovskaya station and then marshrutka #299 (mini bus) will get you there. The cost was under $4 round trip.I think hotels can arrange a tour to Tsarskoye Selo if you are afraid to venture out on your own."

To get there,you can take the metro to Moskovskaya and take a marshrukas(van/bus vehicle) just outside of the station (26Rtakes 30 min). Or take metro to Vitebsk Train Station. Take local train (go up to second floor, by pass first ticket booths go to ticket booth on the left side of the platform for local trains). After you have the ticket got to platform 1 and get off at the \"DETSKOE SELO\" stop or the \"PAVLOVSK\" stop (to see Catherine's son palace). Cost is 30R take 30 min. The stop is within walking distance (about 1mile walk) just go straight accross round-about to end of street then go right 3-4blocks and turn left until you run into it. Without a tour group you have to enter throught Catherine's park (130R). The queue for individuals starts at around 3:30pm (they left groups of 30 at a time starting at 4:00pm) the Palace costs (530R).

The first time I came to Catherine's Palace, I was an impressionable 16 years old and arrived just as the snow fall shifted from a flurry to a steady pour. We had a few hours to kill before our tour started, so we took our time wandering around the grounds. It was almost empty because it was early March and the tourists hadn't really started coming out yet. It was that afternoon that I fell in love with Russia. Catherine's gardens and forests looked almost magical. This was a postcard perfect Russian setting right out of Dr. Zhivago. But most people come here in summer, when it is still breathtakingly beautiful, but you do have to contend with the throngs of tourists. This is good and bad--more tourists mean more chances that there will be a tour in English. If you don't speak Russian and have come on your own, ask if there's going to be a tour in English. If not, they'll quickly figure out that a Russian tour won't benefit you any, and will let you go in to walk around the palace by yourself. The inside of the palace is overwhelming in its opulence. The most impressive room is the recently restored Amber room--the entire room is an elegant (and expensive!) work of art. After the tour, you're allowed to stroll through the rooms again on your own--this gives you a chance to really look closely at the details and to take pictures in a quieter environment. And be sure to leave yourself time to walk through at least some of the outdoor paths. Most tourists don't do this, so you can usually have to path to yourself. It feels like discovering hidden treasure when you happen upon some elegant little statue or charming pagoda in the forest.Getting here on your own is a little tricky, but not impossible. The electric train to Pushkin from Petersburg barely costs anything, and it's a very Russian experience in itself. From there you can take any of the dozens of mini-buses outside the station with \"Palace\" written on the side. Coming on your own and not with a tour will also give you more time to explore the other sights in Pushkin, like the royal carriage house. These other attractions are also interesting, but are rarely visited by non-Russians. If you get hungry, the cafe in the Palace is actually quite good and fairly priced."
