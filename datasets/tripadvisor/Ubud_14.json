We discovered it by accident having decided to eat at the restaurant that backs onto the temple. We enjoyed the meal whilst watching the sun set around the temple. There are then lights along both sides of the causeway between the lily pools.There is a night show, commencing at 7pm. They start to put chairs and lights out around 6pm- so if you want a good photo be there before this time. We stayed for about an hour and a half, appreciating a perfect reflection of the temple in the lily pond.There are rather a lot of people around that really were prancing around the temple for photo poses, showing some disrespect to the sanctity of the place."

I was blessed to be able to get inside the temple and spend an hour alone (except for a local groundskeeper). IMPORTANT: Do NOT attempt to go in to the main temple unless you have proper temple attire (for men and women this means long sleeve shirt (no, not a tank top) + traditional sarong with a sash, women hair pulled back, and do not go in if you are on your moon cycle). Also bring an offering (flowers & incense). Please respect local culture! If you are prepared to come in with this honoring and spiritual presence, you may be able to enter the main temple area. The entry as most pictures depict with the lotus pond is stunning and magical in and of itself though. What you see in the pics is everything if you can't go in the temple - the lotus pond area and front entry wall, which is a great place for pictures. Inside the temple, however, is absolutely stunning and very special, a place to be honored and connect with Saraswati. There is no fee to enter, and the Lotus Cafe that overlooks the pond is a great place to sit and soak it all in."

Near the Campuhan ridge walk to rice paddies too. There is literally a Starbucks at the entrance gate to this temple area. It is a strange blend of old and new; worship and commercialism; traditional and contemporary.The lotus garden on the pond is lovely. Temple looked intricate and interesting from the outside. I did not see anyone offering tours or entrance to the temple itself (it was around 2pm on a Tuesday), so you don't need to worry about covering up in a sari or sarong before you come here."

The pond with the lotus flowers and the old stone architecture totally blew me away and left me amazed with it's jaw dropping beauty and serenity. Truly breathtaking. So much elegance and wonder. I went in the afternoon so did not manage to see or take part in any traditions, which according to a sign says you're allowed to as long as you're obeying and respecting their customs. Definitely drop by to check this great temple out when you're in Ubud town!"

The temple has a beautiful lotus pond in front of it. When we went there, there were no lotus in bloom, but I can image now beautiful it will look during the full bloom season. You cant go inside the temple to see Goddess Saraswati, however it is still worth a visit if you are already in that area."

There is a palace in Ubud by the way (it is called Puri Saren Agung), but there are no water gardens there.Most people wome to visit the water gardens in front of the temple. Its a pretty spot, and great for photos if not too crowded. You do not need to wear a sarong and sash to enter the gardens.The temple itself is small but also quite pretty. To enter the actual temple, you do need to wear a sarong and sash (or when ceremonies are taking place, full traditional Balinese dress).There are nightly balinese dance shows in front of the temple, behind the water lily ponds."

The place is absolutely stunning when empty. Apart from us there was only a local cleaning the gardens to the left. We stayed for a while, took a few pictures and were completely transported. Would love to go inside and watch a ceremony but it was closed at this time. There was a bit of trash (water bottles) near the door, which was a shame..so please people drink all the water you want but do not leave your trash behind. This is supposed to be a holy place. Have respect. Visit earlier in the morning as you might be lucky and miss the crowds. As we were leaving a big group of 30 people appeared and the place was truly transformed. Visit when empty if you have the chance."

The beauty is very captivating and mind blowing....one look and one get mesmerised by the whole temple architecture.The entrance was grand...we bought tickets to enter and had to wear sarong despite wearing long pants. The Saraswati goddess statue was gorgeous to look at.The temple is small inside and only 15 minutes or so needed to visit this temple. Its near the main Ubud centre and one cant miss it. Next to it is Brahma temple. The staffs took our family photos inside and at the main entrance for nearly 2 USD each. We were 15 of us and so the photos turned out as a memorable one especially the effect of the temple architecture itself. It was a lovely temple indeed."

Anyway - The \"Water Temple\" sits just behind the Starbucks, and is a complex array of carved stones, archways, golden Balinese doors, Bonsai trees, and stairways. You can go inside if you are dressed appropriately, and we did go in for a quick walk around. The best part is the outside, with the flanking lotus ponds. We came back for evening photographs, waited out a quick shower, shot the pictures, and then went into the restaurant (Lotus Cafe) that sits almost on the grounds of the temple. Actually, if you go to eat here in the evening, on Saturday (I think) you will get a great view of the live dance performance at the base of the main stairway."

The temple itself is next to Cafe Lotus which we got to admire the temple from and take some awesome photos. Definitely worth the humidity if you are inspired by the Balinese architecture and symbolism. In addition we were attracted to fact that this was a Saraswati temple, Goddess symbolising Knowledge, Arts and Culture who is often depicted in Hindu culture seated on a Lotus flower. Going inside would have added to the occasion but we respected that it was closed that day, unfortunately. So you may want to find out before hand if it is open. Plenty of cafes/restaraunts to keep you hydrated for walking around not forgetting the shade of massive tree that overlooks the ponds."

I found this place a must see, the statute of Goddess Saraswati, who bestows education and intelligence, beautifully portrayed, tucked in a corner, cannot miss this in white and gold. The orchids and adenium bonsai are a plus and beautify the place. An hour or less is enough to go around. The traffic of Ubud will take a lot of time for you to reach the place. At the entrance, people sell tickets, but that's not for entering the temple but for the dance performance in the evenings. So, watch out.The sad part is the temple is abused, cigarette butts and empty beer bottles thrown around. This is not good, request tourists to maintain the decorum of the temple and disturb sentiments of the believers, I felt bad and disturbed."

We arrived early evening to catch the dance (every thurs 730) We were told the wrong time and ended up waiting over an hour for the dance to start. I think it was worth the wait, and enjoyed the costumes and skill of the dancers. My husband is harder to please and finally talked me in to leaving before the end of the show. The temple is definately worth a visit and easy to see if you are wandering through Ubud. Only see the dance if you like that sort of thing! I thought it was great!"

You can also go to the Starbucks (ugh!) and sit on the back veranda or go to the restaurant complex on the other side to watch a performance albeit both places are way overpriced for food/drink (ESPECIALLY the Starbucks!!!).

I went to the temple, ate at the restaurant, had a starbucks and saw a fire dance there. The back alley behind the temple is fun to walk around at night and it's fun to play with the dogs and later watch them greet their owners when they come home from work."

Worth a visit just to enjoy the ambiance and snap a few photos. Easily accessible just behind Cafe Lotus and Starbucks - no need to visit Cafe Lotus in order to see the temple."

The lotus pond and the path that leads up to the temple is beautiful, especially when it's lit at dusk. I didn't try the restaurant there but it definitely looked nice and relaxing. I think it's well worth a stop to spend about 10-20 minutes here to enjoy the tranquility and scenery."

Whether you enjoy a meal in the overlooking cafe or just stop off for some quiet reflection on your way back to the hotel after a night out, you are sure to enjoy the pleasant surroundings. Don't forget your camera."
