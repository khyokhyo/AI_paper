The best way to get there from downtown Tokyo (Ginza Station) is take the Asakusa Line. At Asakusa exit at Gate 4 which is close to the Kaminarimon Gate which is the entrance to the Asakusa ( Sensoji) Temple. There is also the Nakamise Shopping Street where there are many tiny stores selling clothing, crackers and toys and almost everything else. This whole area reflects how people worked I=and lived in the Edo era and you get a feel for old time Japan."

A good but interesting mixture of traditional and modern experiences. Pros: Easy site to get to. It was good fun to walk down the main street to see the variety of souvenirs and of course traditional Japanese snacks. My favourite would have to be the delicious fresh mochi. Good photo opportunities too on a clear day to see some of the new structures mixed in your background such as the skytree tower. Cons: I'm not a believer of fortune telling so I wasn't interested in that whole area at the back. The food areas got overly crowded and uncomfortable at times. "

Closest metro station is Ginza Line G19 (orange line) or Asakusa Line A18 (pink line). Nice promenade on the river bank with views on Sky Tree. You will need 1-2 hours to see the shrine and walk some shopping streets. Of cause add extra time for shopping or dining:) This was highlight of our visit to Tokyo."

I really wanted to like this area, but the main area near Sensoji Temple seemed like a massive tourist trap, with a high markup on \"trinkets\" and even wandering away from the main area it still seemed like a very tourist focused area. In saying that, it was certainly worth the one off visit, but as I went with friends, I wouldn't take my partner back. There were LOTS of people which made it difficult to stop and browse even though we went on a weekday. The Positive: I did have a DELICIOUS Age Manju filled with Sakura Cherry and sweet white bean paste which was priced at 200Yen and so tasty I wish I could eat it every single day!"

Nice neighborhood, lots of places to visit, cafes and restos abound, mini malls and 24 hr convenience stores and dept stores dot the area. Accommodations is much lower compared to Tokyo proper, less crowded and easy access via subway. Anywhere form 11 to 18min travel time."

If you come on a weekend better to come earlier to avoid the crowd. The shopping street that leads to the temple sell a lot of the same things: japanese style clothing, key chains, fans, etc. Make sure to compare prices as some stores in the front sell the same item about $1-2 dollars more than stores in the middle. Make sure to get their red bean cakes. oh so good! also many stores don't want you to take photos thus be mindful of their request!"

I have been to Asakusa long time ago, and it was very nice and peaceful. So I guess you need to avoid weekends if you really want to enjoy the atmosphere. There are many many little shops along the streets and there are some quick bite places. People will line up to get a good/trendy food, so you will notice it. There were some picture perfect spots of the temple and it was quite nice."

Book everything in advance, make reservations, make calculations as your ad hoc needs unlike most other countries can not be accommodated or could me time wasting and costly. Transportation is easy but takes time by any method. 2-Financially Tokyo is expensive to reach and to stay in hotels mostly with small rooms though well equipped.However food, entertainment, shopping are not expensive as expected especially for Dubai residents . Be aware that you should have a small packet for dozens of coins you will get and use. Credit cards are mostly accepted and there are exchange machines almost on any street. For calculations one USD is around 93-97 yen. 3- As mentioned before Transportation between destinations are taking time however you have so many options if you stick to number one rule which is planning ahead. Especially in metro people helping you a lot for any inquiries as the system is a little bit more complex as operated by two companies.Taxi requires more money, some Japanese language skills and patience as roads are mostly only two lanes , has so many traffic lights. 4- High Tech is default expectation in Japan however it is not you will see in daily life. On one side there is solid but aging infrastructure on the other you see lot of encounters with robots in museums which is most interesting how they will shape the future. You can refer to my Asimo videos for that. 5-Fashion is a little bit different in every street . A non-tie business dressing policy adopted for energy saving purposes thus men normally wear just shirts even not jackets . Kimono and obis both are also popular in traditional streets of the city though not for business. Most surprising will be Disneyland where most visiting people are dressed in their beloved characters  6-Traditions are most important part of your visit. You might surprised that tipping is not welcomed in this part of the world. You have all sorts of traditions. ikebana,calligraphy, curtain design,garden design, Sushi,Onsen,Sumo, martial arts,..which are not only practiced for touristic purposes but also still part of life. Look for venues of performance and do not forget to plan ahead. 7-Shopping is easy as there are thousands of stores in this city of cities.You can also shop tax free after 5000 yen for 8% discount. Malls are everywhere with different shop mixes mostly with no bargains.In traditional parts like Asakusa you will also have souvenir shops on the streets. 8-Food is what Tokyo stands for. Almost 100,000 restaurants welcoming you for all sort of food at very attractive prices. Over 200 Michelin restaurants defines a record for a city.if you are looking for restaurant , do not expect them at ground level or street level as they might be at 6th floor of a building as well. Menus in English are widely available and language does not creat a barrier for food as mostly they are shown with pictures or with plastic display models in the entrance. 9-Fuji Mountain trip is a must either as daily one or with stay over for a night. It is amazing landscape with history and tradition. Hato bus tour with a back turn with Shinkansen / Bullet trip is a recommended one. Expect more harsh weather conditions than the city. During the visit you will also experience beautiful five lakes and thermal town Hakone. 10-Other cities are also within reach of hours with Bullet trains though for the one wishing to go to Kyoto either landing to or departure from Osaka airport is better. Yokohama is much shorter by bullet train almost 30 minutes. Except historical reasons Yokohama also hosts one of the insane roller coaster of the world ,Hakkejima and its 107 meters vertical drop closed blue fall. 11-Tokyo has two airports from which Narita is almost 90 minutes drive and taxi cost USD 200. You have other options as well but expect 45-60 min to reach the city even with the fastest train. 12-Disneyland is not the best however practically a must for families. It is cheap and easy to buy online.However fast track needs on site printing and planning for allocated slots. 13-Language is in Tokyo not a problem though not as easy as in Dubai.

There're a plenty of traditional-like restaurants, specialized shops, the atmosphere you get by the way people interact with you is incredible, the main temple Sens\u00f4-ji is absolutely gorgeous... You can also go for a walk alongside the Sumida river or get lost between the little streets nearby the temple, maybe an old grandpa will stop his bike next to you to give you a map of the neighborhood, just because you seemed lost and he had one in his pocket..."

Most of area rebuilt after WW2 so lots of 1950s architecture. But some odd little wooden buildings too. You really can't get that lost with the Skytree as your marker. So don't worry.

The neighbourhood is far from underwhelming especially with the awesome crowds milling through the covered shopping areas during the weekend. But the old theatre neighbourhood has a different energy to it - it remains unique and traditional, with dramatic theatric figures on top of cafes, tourist souvenir stores alongside decades old wholesale shops, shops selling kimono fabric, handmade crafts and paper goods and traditional Asakusa soba, ramen and sweets like the creamy sweet potato tart. Plenty of good eateries and dessert shops around, some hidden along small side lanes. We loved staying here for a week. We recommend taking early morning and early morning/late evening walks around the Sensoji Temple and Kaminarimon area. Being near the Sumida River, travellers also get to experience Tokyo from the water with the Tokyo Cruise terminal just a few blocks away from Asakusa Station and Kaminarimon/Sensoji area. You can sit along the river facing the Skytree, or cruise along the River all the way to Odaiba Seaside Park on a round trip, somewhat pricey but worth it. It is also a stop away from the Tokyo Skytree on the Tobu line. All this 30 mins away from Shibuya."

The central tourist area of Asakusa will blast you with a little bit of everything, from temples and shrines to traditional-looking shops selling food and souvenirs, but somewhere among the swarms of tourists, rickshaws, and people walking around in rented kimonos, you'll start to get the feeling that it's all a little fake. And it is! As in a lot of tourist areas, you'll find that the food is slightly more expensive and slightly worse than what you'll find elsewhere, the shops sell nothing but the same kind of souvenirs you'd see anywhere, and the temples are superficially beautiful but have been \"restored\" to the point where they fail to retain a good portion of their historical charm (and are next to impossible to enjoy in the crowds anyways). In spite of that, Asakusa can still merit a visit, especially if you only have a few days in the city. There's a much wider variety of food than you'll find in the typical Tokyo neighborhood, including several outstanding places (Ichiran Ramen!), the walk along the Sumidagawa is beautiful by any standard, and Senso-ji is quite nice at night when the crowds have gone home but the temple grounds remain open. The neighborhood calms down quite a bit at night, which is very nice if you're staying in the area and want to get a good night's sleep but not so nice if you're looking for any sort of nightlife."

Behind these main shops, on either side, are not so well-known but shops selling authentic traditional Japanese things including handmade dolls, specialty knives that can cost tens of thousands of Yen per knife, some run by the same family for generations. Towards half way down, on the right, you can get a clear view of Tokyo Tree which was built to replace Tokyo Tower. An authentic wooden gate built without using nails guards the entrance to the Sensoji Temple housing the Goddess of Mercy. On the back of this gate are hung giant straw sandals (zori) supposedly Buddha's. A giant brazier at the center where people crowd around to try to grasp some of the smoke from the burning incense to relieve ailments on their bodies. So if you have headaches, get some smoke to pat on your head. On either side are shops selling charms & talismans. Nearby is the Asakusa shrine which is famous for the Sanja Matsuri (festival). Though not many trees, cherry blossom viewing is also part of its attraction.On the right just after the brazier is where you use the water to wash your hands & mouth (misogi) to purify yourself before getting to the temple. The correct ritual is:First, scoop up water in a ladle with your right hand and pour water over your left hand. Next, hold the ladle with your left hand and pour water over your right hand. In your left hand, take some water that you have scooped with the ladle and rinse your mouth. Never touch the ladle directly to your mouth. Lastly, using the remaining water, tip the ladle to rinse it off. Scoop up water only one time, at the very first step of the process. There are different rituals for praying at temples (otera) & shrines (jinja).Back at the entrance, young college students do part-time work pulling rickshaws making a short circuit around the area which are popular with tourists. Average price is around Yen2500-3000 for the ride. Diagonally across is the Tourist Information mostly manned by volunteers who do speak some English."

Asakusa is a unique destination \u2014 a true kaleidoscope where times and cultures intersect and create ever-changing patterns: East & West; old and new; incense and samba; tempura and ragtime; religion and vaudeville. Just around the corner from the venerable Sensoji Temple, you'll find a rinky-dink amusement park, on one side, and Japan's oldest Western-style bar, on the other side. The whole area hums with a down-to-earth energy that you won't find in other popular tourist destinations in Tokyo \u2014 partly, we learned, because the local traditional businesses are still mostly (and proudly) owned and operated by folks who have lived in Asakusa for generations. Highly recommended as a full afternoon excursion for a taste of the authentic \"downtown\" ambience of old Edo (as Tokyo used to be known)."

Kaminarimon is the first of two large entrance gates leading to Sensoji Temple. First built more than 1000 years ago, it is the symbol of Asakusa. The temple is approached via the Nakamise, a shopping street that has been providing temple visitors with a variety of traditional, local snacks and tourist souvenirs for centuries.Asakusa can easily be explored on foot. Alternatively, you can consider a guided tour on a rickshaw (jinrikisha, literally \"man powered vehicle\"). A 30 minute tour for two persons costs around 9000 yen. Shorter and longer courses are also available.The area is very busy with many tourist filled with souvenir stalls and people taking pictures with kimonos. Go to the visitor building and up to the top floor for a great view of the area.Shin-Nakamise or \"New Nakamise\" runs perpendicular to the Nakamise Shopping Street. It is a covered shopping arcade lined by various shops and restaurants. In addition, there are additional department stores, restaurants and cafes that line the adjacent streets.A must see if and worth your time if your first visit to Tokyo."

Since Im European I have attracted a lot of Asian attention on me by wearing their traditional Kimono....Many Chinese asked me to take a picture with me. On the downside the slippers I got as part of the dress were quite hard to wear around...It was an unique experience... I felt just a tiny bit like a Japanese. Though not sure I am willing to do it again (at least not in the same area). I went to the traditional spots of Asakusa, prayed at Buddha and tried some beans delights which were adorable. Bought also some for my family and took 10000 pictures. Unfortunately te time was not enough to try and see everything but that is another reason to visit again Tokyo.I took the metro and went to the zoo which was another great experience. The giant pandas were the highlight of the visit there, though I liked the entire concept as you get very close to the animals yet at a safe enough distance.

And it's free to have a nice view from there.The staff at the Tourist information centre is very helpful and they will recommend you where you can go at Asakusa.There're lots of small stall around this area, you will spend the whole day or at least half a day there. You may try out the food and there're lots of souvenir to buy at this area. During our visit, we saw TV station shooting at 1 of the stall. You may also see a lot of tourist rented the traditional costume (Kimono) and walk around this area. It'll be a different experience."

But, I've recently learned from my foreign friends and guests that Asakusa is a must place, even if you visit Kyoto and I always take then there. First, foreigners love Asakusa: not only because of Senso-ji Temple, Tokyo SkyTree and Kappabashi Kitchen Town, but also because of nice restaurants, such as Imahan, Kikko, Semetaro, etc. and unique old Edo atmosphere of the town. Second, towns in East Central Tokyo, such as Asakusa, Ueno, Ryogoku, Kinshicho are old downtown(called Shitamachi in Japanese) of Tokyo with nice frack open-minded people for generations. Third, these are mixed with the international atmosphere with so many foreign visitors: you can see more foreigners in Asakusa than in other towns in Tokyo. I can understand why many foreigners like staying in Asakusa!!"

Many tour groups come here making it very busy. If you're looking to rent or buy kimono and accessories then this is the place in Tokyo to go to. You can also have rickshaw rides here. The shrine at the top was very impressive. Not so impressive what the performing monkey on a chair outside. Lots of little shops in the shopping street. Go to Wargo to buy traditional Japanese hair accessories (kanzashi)."

It doesn't mean that it's not good, it just means that not everyone else out their is as hypnotized by Japan as I am. After all, there is a reason that I had to return to live & work there on 3 separate occasions, after my first visit there (right after college in 1999)... For me, Asakusa represents everything that is so spectacular about Japan. It has this peculiar blend of the traditional/ancient, mixed in with the ultra-modern, all at once. Everything is convenient, organized, efficient, and clean. Just thinking of words to describe it now, makes me want to go back again!"

They are sold both with and without sweet bean paste. I prefer the store which an old uncle was baking, an uncle packing then an aunt selling, it was instantly from the baking machine, red bean fillings & the outer skin was so balance, selling one in a packing then u can just try one, if nice then to buy more\uff1banother store quite outstanding at the corner but I felt the red bean fillings was too much as the skin is too thin, selling a few in one packing. Watch out a corner ice-cream store, the mocha ice-cream was superb. A lot of souvenirs specific \"Asakusa logo\" cannot find elsewhere so must buy here but design & quality was so so.Don't just walk the Main Street Nakamise, walk to the back alley, you will find something else to see!

The temple is lit up at night when it's a lot less crowded. Perhaps head here after dark for dinner? Also close by is Nakamise shopping street - crowded but good fun. Lots of snack food, and all the cute souvenirs you could ask for.This is also a good area for restaurants especially Izakayas (Japanese pubs). When the working day is over, these are filled with office workers squeezed onto benches and stools enjoying beers and Yakatori (skewers of food).

Right outside the main gate is the Information visitor center which can provide all the required information about this location including maps and few insighful tips. As you enter the main gate, right there on the gate are large bells, impressive and mammoth. The entrance is followed by lane of orderly shops on both sides, have all kinds of items to sell (products, knick-knacks, souvenirs...) and food items. It is an energetic and vibrant experience.As you get through a long corridor of shops, you arrive at another massive gate, again with large bells and it leads you into Sensouji Temple. The temple is serene and a tranquil experience. As you get in and observe some of the local rituals and leave there is a large Buddha statue outside and has a very calming effect. There is a also a Japanese Pagoda in the complex and right from the complex you can also see a modern Sky Tower which is several blocks from Asakusa location.Overall, worth visit and plan on spending 3-5 hours.Right outside next to the visitor center is the Denny's restaurant so if you are tired and hungry after the visit, it is a great place to eat a good bite including tea/coffee to refresh. Down the lane, I was told, there is also a Burger King for those want American fast food.The Asakusa train station is very close and you can connect to any location in Tokyo, in some cases with a train change."

If you really want a full depth guide, you can get one for FREE (and if you're lucky, you can get someone that speaks great english) if you just visit the Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center right across Kaminarimon Gate. We were also able to watch a free Geisha Ozashiki Odori (Traditional Dance) organized by the said Info Center but you need to get your hands on tickets early because the seats are limited (PS they have mini games after the show and my brother won a prize!). You can also enjoy window shopping at Nakamise-dori. If you really want to buy something, be sure to check out every shop because most, if not all, shops jack up their prices because their target market is the pack of wide-eyed tourists that are just so excited to bask in the cultural awesomeness of Japan. There are other temples surrounding Sensouji so be sure to walk around the area before leaving."

The temple is spectacularly lit up, there's a quaint tiny amusement park that locals line up for to visit.

The shopping out the front of the temple is also great as are the shops around the temple, a fantastic place to get souvenirs (kitschy and non-kitschy varieties), we actually came back on our last day to stock up! Great food in the area, and several other smaller temples worth a visit too. First timers to Japan, a solid spot to visit."

The main street leading up to the Senso-ji temple (Nakamise-d\u014dri) is lined with small shops for confections and souvenirs. The smells are intoxicating and it is impossible to resist buying at least one of the delicious treats. There are restaurants and cafes down the sides streets if you are looking for something a little more substantial to eat as well. Once you reach the temple, the site of this enormous and active temple is astounding. The level of artistic detail is rarely seen in the western world in this magnitude. The temple sits on garden grounds that are spacious and beautiful. It was not originally a destination on our itinerary, but I now would have regretted missing it."

Please stop and eat, as it is considered very rude to eat on the go. There is plenty to stumble upon.

This was one of our favorite places during our two and half week stay in Japan with a good mix of different things to do and loads of variety in such a small area. Firstly, it is a highly touristy area so there might not be a true authentic feeling if that's what you're looking for but it's a great romp enjoying the crowd's energy, multiple food stalls, souvenir shops as well as exploring the temple. We arrived hungry so we pigged out along Nakamise Street. Our favorite item was fried manju (rice flour, savory or sweet filling and then tempura coated before frying) but there were also popular stalls selling soy rice crackers (senbei), flavored rice dumplings on skewers (dango), sponge cakes, sweet pancakes, filled pastries (ningyo yak) and quite a lot of bean paste and strawberry items as well. (Note: It is considered polite to loiter / eat your food items in front of the stall you purchased them from and not block any other stall/store's space.)"

It has one of the best cornball tourist souvenir shop districts IN THE WORLD leading up to it, which is why I come here. Next to Ye Olde Curiosity Shoppe in Seattle and Buffalo Bill Cody's Trading Post in North Platte Nebraska, this is as good as it gets (Tokyo Tower may be #5, after South of the Border). Tons of Japanese geegaws as well as typical tourist junk -- I got a pair of DEVO style cyclops sunglasses for 1000\u00a5, while my wife bought actual nice textiles from Japan for 1300\u00a5. So there's a variety. Lots of good, if touristy, places to eat around here. The actual temple leaves me flat, but I'm team Shinto, so I really groove on the quiet, reflective atmosphere of the Meiji Jinguu Shrine in Harajuku, versus this crowded loud claptrap.Here's my insider suggestion: Turn left at the main temple and walk to the amusement park. While the temple is so packed with tourists it feels like you're in Des Moines, the amusement park is 100% locals only (totally friendly to tourists though). It's a great peek at older post-war Japan, and it has real Japanese people in it. Plus you can ride a giant battery powered plush panda bumper car for like 400\u00a5. There are lots of mega cornball attractions outside the park, like a \"ninja photo booth\" and I recommend those as well, if you like corny stuff. But the amusement park is a real part of Japan not many westerners take the time to see -- I only went when a Japanese friend who knew of my love of schmaltzy things took me there. It's neat.Also, if your family has been bugging you to go to a cat cafe, there are cheap ones around there. I think we did 30 minutes for like 600\u00a5 each? Or 400? I forget but it felt cheap and the cats were chill. We went to the one on Orange street. (Turn left at the ninja model on the souvenir walk, and left again at the next street -- then look up, it's on floor two)."

There are many, many foreigners to interact with here if that's your thing, and there are some pretty decent food establishments in the area, such as a Toriyoshi that serves meat and vegetables on sticks (though they're pretty pricey).Really, though, just bathing in the atmosphere here is fantastic, especially when the cherry blossoms are falling in the wind, framing the scene for perfect photo opportunities in spring.

We noted visitors from Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, China as well as Japan.Secondly the temple is beautifully maintained. The appointments, fittings and even the painting are first class. Its possible that a major restoration has been recently completed. Regardless this is a standout.and finally the complex is sizable, particularly for a city as dense as Tokyo. Many smaller temples and some small gardens with plenty of cherry blossoms made this visit really memorable. If you are in Tokyo at the moment his is a must do."

The second gate after shopping alley, then you will enter the temple main area. A lot of people come to pray and make wishes, so don't expect solitude. Nevertheless the beauty will still easily felt. Best time to visit is early morning or near sunset."

Definitely try Ningyo Yaki, Japanese small sponge cakes in different shapes and Kaminari Okoshi (tastes like really good sweet rice crackers).

You can also walk to take a boat tour on the river if the weather is suitable. There are some nice hotels and restaurants on the adjacent streets so if you get tired of the crowd you can take a side street and look for a nice place to eat or have a drink.It is suitable for a few hours or half a day trip if you include the temple."

The street stalls directly in line with the main temple are interesting and suggest trying the little cakes with plum filling (not sure what they're called). The temple is very pretty but the overwhelming smell of incense burning is a bit off putting when you're not used to it. There are beautiful gardens with plenty of photo opportunities, fishponds with koi and many side streets to explore. Our 2nd visit was on a Saturday and it was so crowded you virtually couldn't move !!! As we had already seen the temple and main street area, we went and further explored the side streets. Highly recommend but NOT on a weekend !"

We had all gone to get kimono professionally fitted and headed out to Asakusa for the day.It is a little crowded but there are many street vendors, and cool things going on in the streets. We took a rickshaw through the streets and the tour guide was really funny. I speak Japanese so I was able to translate for my friend what he couldn't convey in English, but if you are a tourist their English is great and that isn't a problem.He stopped to let us take photos and showed us the best photo ops around. Asakusa also has great street food. We tried black sesame ice cream sandwiches and wow were they good!We got up the the temple that holds a giant lantern in front. My friends explained that a thunder God was trapped inside the lantern.Overall this is a great place that you shouldn't miss!"

The elevator is packed full of guests, but it travels so fast that you are to the 350 m point in no time. great views from that level, you can go up to the 450 m level via another elevator and about 1000 yen more.

Check out the wonderful atmospheric streets at the side of the shrine/temple. If you stay in this area you will love coming back here to the quiet village atmosphere. Lovely shrines and temples and so many fantastic places to eat. On that point - please be careful - if you enter that cute little sushi bar - first ask - 'is there table charge, service charge, must I buy extra' - our only bad experience in the whole of Japan was a sushi bar here - the price was excessive and then at the end they tried to charge us 40 000 JPY for sitting at a tiny table! They also brought additional food and drink and then added the price to the bill. The sushi chef got nasty and we had to leave pretty quickly - an absolute shocker for a little family eve out at the start of our Japan holiday. I noticed the charge was written on the menu right in the middle where you wouldn't notice it. Apparently it happens at expensive restaurants but it's unusual for this area and was a lesson for us - we never had the experience again. I noticed the sushi bar had no name on the outside so I can't tell you which one. However, don't miss this out on a visit to this area as you feel transported back in time particularly at night."

Best to visit at the end of the day before the temple and the shops close before 1900. Need to visit the temple as it gives you a glimpse of Taoism practices while the shops were great for souvenir shopping. While shops mainly sell identicial stuff, one may need to canvass as prices of one may differ from the other. A lot of good restaurants and hole-in-the-wall eateries on the side streets that one can explore, as well. For those who frequent the toilets, there were public toilets at both sides of the temple, parallel to the shops so no need to look for restaurants to use the toilet while shopping/ sightseeing."

From souvenir shopping, temple hopping, sight seeing and food tripping. There are also rickshaw drivers who are very enthusiastic to get tourists to ride with them. There are also drinking place where you see working class Japanese who are drinking in the middle of the week."

What I liked:- Accessibility; this Place is accessible on one of the Train services (tho not JR Line) and within a short walk from the Train Station- Attraction; The view is glorious; the Street decorated with sparking flowers leading up to the Sensoji Temple really builds on to the overall experience; I also had the honor of seeing a Geisha upfront (shot for a supposed documentary)- Shopping; the street is full of shops with various gifts/souvenir and foods. Off the main street, you can also find many cafes and shops by the sides which will amaze youConclusion:This is a must visit, you will not be disappointed."

This visit is what I call as a sightseeing and shopping and eating all in a go!If only it didnt rain, perhaps we could have stayed longer to enjoy the many many shops here catering for locals and foreigners alike. At the end of the long path way where one can't help shifting from left to right and vice versa to get into shops, there is the famous temple Sensoji.But after awhile, one cannot help herself but turned her back on the temple and started to walk back towards the exciting street of shops to end up buying what matters most to her - anpan, snacks, mochi what have you. Until it rained again signalling that one should stop and proceed home before more damage is done to her pocket and obediently walked to the nearest subway station.which is about 100 meters away and dutifully got on the subway.With a happy smile and 10 plastic bags filled with goodies in both hands!

That is the place where every visitor would take a picture to keep as a souvenir! The transport system to come to Asakusa is not that difficult either. Trust me, we used a subway to reach here! (Tokyo Toei Subway Line, please note that using the JR to come to Asakusa is not convenient as not only it is more expensive, but after you go down from JR it takes about another 20 minutes to walk here).Hint: I was lucky because my parents stayed in Japan before. So travelling around Tokyo using the Subway was F-U-N! (Japan is a pretty safe place so no worries~).Anyway back to Asakusa, you can find tons of delicious food and desserts here, souvenir yes, and of course not forgetting the Senso-Ji Buddhist temple as you keep walking further up. You may see pretty young Japanese girls with Yukata walking towards the temple hehe... To be specific, it is to celebrate their 20th birthday here! (the reaching of adulthood age for Japanese)For the rest of what I have seen here? Well you gotta make more research and come here yourself and explore this place.It is totally worth your time (to see the cute Japanese girls as well)."

This place felt so much more crowded than the Meiji temple or any of the other little temples, gardens and shrines we visited during our trip. If you need souvenirs, though, this seems to be the place.There is an entire \"village\" of shops at the main entrance. Maybe it was the time of day or time of year, but there was a wall of people all the way from the main street, through the gate, and up to the temple. The grounds contain the iconic watchtower (the one that you see in all of the photos of Asakusa), but you should be aware that you cannot go into that building. There is a nice garden and some smaller buildings on the grounds, where it seemed that the locals were visiting, but the main attraction for visitors was the main temple. While there was a huge crowd, it didn't really affect our experience until we decided it was time to go and felt like salmon swimming upstream. Now that I have been there, I know that it is probably best to stop by the shops on the way INTO the temple rather than trying to leave via the main gate. You can easily take a side street and bypass the crowds if you don't care to stop at any of the shops!On a relatively clear day, there is a good view of the Sky Tree, which many people suggest as the next stop on your tour. We didn't have time, and had already visited the Tokyo Tower, so we just caught the subway back to our hotel. There are many subway and train stops conveniently located nearby, and Ueno park with the Tokyo National Museum is within walking distance, depending on what that means to you (I think it is around 2 miles away)"

After walking up and down, we realised that the shops nearer to Sensoji gets progressively more expensive. So if you want to buy simple and cheap souvenirs as gifts back home, you are better off buying from the shops nearer to the Kaminarimon (main entrance).There are places there where you can rent kimonos to wear as you walk along the streets. Some shops even offer Tea ceremony experiences. Hint: If you want to photograph the entire Nakamise Street including Sensoji, go up to the top floor of the tourist information centre across the road from the Kaminarimon."

Along the way from the subway station, there were lots of little shops and one block away from the Temple, you will see a street lined with small wooden shops/booths with snacks and souvenirs. I had the \"Asakusa Ice Cream Sandwich\", you pick the flavor ice cream and they pack it between two wafers shaped like the lanterns in front of the temple.

Cheaper accomodation in Tokyo is generally around Asakusa, especially youth hostels.

Be careful though as its quite pricey compared to others areas in Tokyo since this is a tourist attraction. I've had the best Tempura in Asakusa and that is whats its known for as well.Shopping - this what makes Asakusa a nice place to visit, especially if you are short on time while going around Tokyo. My friend bought a Kimono set for just 2,000 YEn! We can't believe it but its her favorite souvenir from Japan. There are other shops of interest around and you may easily lost track of time here.Best time to go is around 4:30PM where you can see a glimpse of the day sight the temple has to offer and then stay until dinner time and walk around the neighborhood."

But walking from Asakusa train station all the way to these temples leads you to Japanese-authentic souvenir shops and items you will not see elsewhere. There's this very helpful tourist guide office station just across its street where they have very informative reading materials and staff to assist you. They also have money exchange there because you just can't stop shopping when you're here.The food options are also very interesting. I've had my best takoyoki there so far. Be mindful though of their culture. You must eat the food only in front of the stall where you bought them. Don't eat them somewhere else as it may be a little offensive.This place is overall highly recommended for everyone traveling to Tokyo.

My 14 year old and I came on the Saturday to see the Sensoji Temple (amazing, reviewed separately), we also got a lovely surprise of finding all the little streets and alleys with all sorts of shops, food places and gifts. It is touristy but feels very relaxed, the atmosphere is great, not at all like the huge areas like Shinjuku or Shibuya. We bought souvenirs, had photos done where our heads were superimposed onto Japanese characters (a great souvenir and only 1000 jpy each). We also went to the Ninja Experience which was really good fun. This involved a \"lesson\" in being a Ninja. Our Ninja Master ( great guy, really entertaining) showed us how to use swords, stealth, concealment and how to throw shurikens (ninja stars). Thoroughly enjoyable hour that we shared with other Japanese and Spanish tourists. We ate in a tiny restaurant where we could see an old lady at work in the kitchen (she made our Ramen and gzoyas from scratch). We enjoyed an ice cream (as well as the usual there were some very local flavours (see picture). We saw lots of people in traditional costumes, I especially loved seeing the ladies in their kimonos (who were very gracious to pose for a picture with us). We ended up in Dom Quiote store, a huge multi floor place selling everything! We bought lots of Japanese sweets and green tea kitkats to bring home as well as a huge bag of Panko crumbs that only cost about 50p, would be 10 times that in the UK when you can find them! A fantastic day out"

One of my very favorite things is to get the fresh toasted rice crackers at one of the stalls. If you're a fan of rice crackers, you are going to be BLOWN AWAY at how wonderfully delicious these are. They toast the crackers and then dip them in the soy sauce mixture and hand them to you, hot and ready to eat. Oh, oh...the wonder of it. If you don't speak Japanese, they do cater to tourists (of course). Most labels are in English, and most of the restaurants have English menus. Or, at very least, you can go point at the plastic food in the window... :-).I love walking through the stalls, back alleys and surrounding areas to both window shop and people watch. Souvenir shopping here is a must...if that's your thing. The prices are competitively low. And the people watching is priceless."

Our driver Kazuki made sure we were in safely, then took us down a street of cherry trees which blossom beautifully in the spring.

Personally I enjoy the walk up Asakusa dori from Ueno JR or Kesei station past all the religious goods stores - but it is a bit long for some. Just remember there are two subway companies going there and the tickets are not compatible. The backstreets are really worth exploring, but do your research if you are interested in specialty shopping. I for instance, stumbled across a coffee specialist shop but too late in the evening so it was shut. Same goes for food. Many places serve tourist slop but there are nice little places, sometimes serving European food of excellent quality (San Gusto Pizzeria springs to mind).

Two good shops that sell Japanese pottery. Allow at least one hour just for window shopping. You must browse as there is a myriad of shops selling everything you can imagine. Please watch out for your belongings. This is a tourist spot and although the Japanese are extremely honest and law abiding, there is certainly a mix of many nationalities in this area. Sadly, shop-lifting, bag snatching and pick pocketing is not at all uncommon.Nearly all shops close at 6PM when the temple doors close.There could be a long line to enter the main temple hall."

Yes, it's the number one tourist stop in Taito, that means lots of tourists.Go see the area, but then escape to the less touristy areas to get a real feel of Tokyo. If you are up for a walk, leave Asakusa and walk towards Ueno park, mixing back streets with the wide boulevard of Kotobuki."

Take some time to try Japanese street-food, then go make a wish at the temple.You can go there by metro, Asakusa station. Using google map to navigate is the best way. There are 2 metro lines that go there, so try not to get confused. The tickets can't be used together even if the price is the same. :)There are many local food stands along the way, i found the ones near the entrance were slightly cheaper than the ones near the temple.Also there is a delicious melon bread shop here.(heard from local. Yes they sell only melon bread) Facing the temple, keep an eye to the right for the shop somewhere along the way."

This is the place to get well priced and good quality souvenirs. Just heading one block off the main drag delivers better deals.I'd suggest heading there on a weekend if possible as you can get a free walking tour at 11.00 or 13.15.Head to the Asakusa Culture Tourist Centre on the corner opposite the main entry way for the temple near the metro station. Our guide said to watch our pockets. Given our sense of safety here it was perhaps a good reminder as we just never worried about pick pockets!"

There were some great little street markets and stalls set throughout especially around the Shrine. It has a more laid back feel to it but does get very busy.We visited some great little bars around there but you must go looking for them. Can be hard to find. I will say though we did get refused entry to a few places because we were western...It was a Sunday night and I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt that they were just over tourists...(Happens more than you think though) There is a large canal near by where we caught a ferry to Odaiba. This turned out to be a master stroke as we go to see a lot more of Tokyo than we thought. The trip on the ferry was about 45 mins and the transport back into Tokyo from Odaiba is just as easy...Great day out or can spread over a couple with the Skytree etc being so close."

This is a good jump-off point for visiting other key attractions in Tokyo. Plot your time accordingly!"

A complete delight to walk around the complex, and stalls with food (especially seafood) and wares. Fresh rice crackers are worth seeking out and trying. One practical tip while traveling with kids is to have enough water on hand, it gets hot during summer. Plenty of attractions to keep even the young ones entertained."

On arriving at the temple area, the entrance will be filled with people having their picture taken with the big colourful lanterns in the archway. It can get very crowded but all part of the experience. Once through the entrance there are two lines of souvenir shops selling all kinds of gifts, but many of these can be bought cheaper elsewhere. Walking down to the end of the shops you find the main temple in front of you, with another to the left side and the Tokyo Sky tree towering above the skyline to your right. Take your time and enjoy the whole scene. The inside of the temple is a glorious colourful scene, make sure you enjoy the murals on the ceiling. Be prepared for a bit of crowd jostling though as it does get very busy inside.This is an impressive temple, but Kyoto has many more impressive temples to offer. There are some nice areas to shop just a short walk away and plenty of places to eat. If you are lucky, like I was on the day I visited, you could see some traditional costumes being worn by some visitors. All in all a nice, but very commercialised place to spend a few hours."

We signed up with the Japanican Cityrama Tokyo Morning - Meiji Shrine, Imperial Palace Gardens, and Senso-ji Temple (Asakusa) tour. Our tour guide gave us all the information and history we were looking for at each spot and the tour spent just enough time in each destination except Asakusa. Asakusa was my favorite part of the whole trip and despite being given the option to stay and let it be our final stop (instead of being dropped off in Ginza), I was told I would have to tell them ahead of time. Since I had not seen what Asakusa was like I had no idea that I would want to stay there longer. I really wish I was given more time to browse the market so my advice to any travelers contemplating this tour, take it! But make sure your final stop is Asakusa instead of Ginza.I loved Asakusa because of all the little shops and cute trinkets available for purchase. I bought all my souvenirs here and was happy that they weren't chintzy, cheap toys like most tourist gift shops offer around the world. These aren't your typical name-written-on-a-grain-of-rice necklaces or postcards and whatnot, these are unique, quality gifts reflective of Japanese culture."

There is so much happening in the alleys that its worth spending some time to look around.How to explore: Start at the main gates, hire a guide if you can (but we found it very hard to find English speaking guides at the venues. You are better off reading about it early or using a tour operator). Then walk to the 2 main attractions and then the gardens on the left. Once you complete the gardens, continue walking till you exit. Outside, you will find more alleyways and eateries that are absolutely amazing!When to go: I would advise that you complete this early in the day, as most tourists then head off to the skytree right after (its a longish walk away). Even if you arent planning on seeing the sky tower or are afraid of heights, you should complete Asakusa in the morning (there isnt a night life scene anyway)."

It's crowded but fun- At the shrine, put/donate a 100Yen coin in one of the slots then shake a box while making a wish and randomly pick a stick where a number in Japanese is engraved, then find the drawer with the same sign/number and take your good fortune paper. If it's good, keep it :) If it's bad, tie the paper on one of the hanging lines. Just watch the others and do the same, it's fun!- Walk around, there are plenty of side streets with loads of shopping for souvenirs, kimonos, sticks, ... and great food as well. Don't do only in the main street leading to the shrine.- Go at the visitor center across the main street / Asakusa metro station and take the lift to the top.

Our hotel was just across the street from the Kaminarimon so we spent a good amount of time in the area around Sensoji. During the day Asakusa is a bustling place, full of both tourist with selfie sticks and locals going about their daily lives. The Asakusa visitor center is a great place to pick up some maps of the city, and the building has a free observation deck overlooking the Sensoji complex and the neighboring Sumida district across the river. The obvious highlight of Asakusa is Sensoji and the Asakusa Shrine. Take some time to explore all of the side streets radiating off the main Nakamise market street leading up to the temple. The area has a lot of good food options, interesting shops, and great people to meet. At night many of the tourists disappear and the temple complex and surrounding streets are a wonderful place to stroll. The illuminated buildings of Sensoji and the glowing Skytree towering overhead are such an amazing juxtaposition. It's an area of Tokyo that's definitely worth a visit, and if you're planning to stay in Asakusa there are convenient transportation options that allow you to get anywhere in the city with relative ease. I'm very happy that we chose this area to stay in while we visited Tokyo."

One half of the city was like a mini vegas, with lots of gambling places, and the other half a street lined with shop snacks ending at the temple. We walked to the front of the temple but didn't feel inclined to fully explore it. Because it was cold, we instead searched for a local bar to get a drink. It was hard to find one with a good vibe, but eventually we stumbled upon this small bar (big enough to fit 5-7 people) where locals and the owners were very inviting! I think this would be an interesting area to stay in an explore more of."

It's really quiet, especially at night, even though there's probably just as much of vibrant nightlife as anywhere else in the city\u2014it's just more hidden and spread out. There's Senso-ji temple, which is a great place to meditate on your thoughts, and plenty of little shops and restaurants.The neighborhood feels more representative of the east part of Tokyo in that it is traditionally Japanese. Even if you're not staying in the area, visit Asakusa at least once when you're in Tokyo\u2014especially if you're an avid shopper! I bought a great handmade cooking knife from a store that was on the corner of one of the alleys."

In some of the shops kimono is available for rent. I dont think any new comer to Tokyo can miss this place. One visit is worth for feeling the vibes of Tokyo. First day, i had 1 hour.

In Japan, the year's shortest day and longest night is traditionally celebrated. It is celebrated yearly on February 3 as part of the Spring Festival and is accompanied by a special ritual to cleanse away all the evil of the former year and drive away disease-bringing evil spirits for the year to come. We were witness to the bean tossing ceremony (roasted soybeans) that were thrown from the temple by special guests. As part of bringing luck in, it is customary to eat roasted soybeans, one for each year of one's life plus one more for bringing good luck for the year to come. I was lucky enough to have caught/received 3 bags of beans containing just the right amount of beans! If you have a chance to go next year it was well worth it. Note, many other temples conduct these ceremonies. Once finished, we spend the rest of the day shopping in the many small streets and shops. Worth walking to is Kitchenware Town (a few short blocks away) for all you foodies and chefs alike. Another store not to miss is Den-Gama, a Japanese pottery shop found on Asakusa street."

Seriously though, you can't really get lost because there are people everywhere and eventually even if you are walking aimlessly, you will still see the subway (this is a main stop and you can see the temple area easily or follow the crowds). There are also tourist police you can ask for directions. This is a beautiful temple area along with the side markets on the streets.So many things to see (cultural temple area, shopping, restaurants, vendors) and great for safe walking. It is busy but not overly congested. The only challenge I had was the lack of translation since this is a very popular visitor area. I wish I had been able to understand the signs and read more about the cultural significance here. There are several areas near the temple where you will see obvious common spiritual rituals but without knowing exactly what they mean, you only are experiencing part of this beauty.After walking around, you will undoubtedly be hungry. Pretty sure everything here would be great since there is such a wide variety. Vendors display their prepared meals in glass cases to give you an idea of what you might order. Snacks are also available for purchase in the street market area. The vendors do ask that you eat in front of their stalls though. I'm sure this practice keeps the area very clean too. Try to find the green tea \"ice cream burger\" - so cute and tiny (hits the spot after all that walking even on a cool day). The vendors have lot of little trinkets to purchase for reasonably priced souvenirs."

It is lined with shops selling all kinds of kitchen and table wares. I found beautiful ceramic wares at very affordable prices."

Further in are the souvenirs although not cheap, it's still worth the time and effort to find something which you might not find as where like lu my charm, phone accessories, personal chopsticks etc. Walking into the shrine you can do 3 things, get a divination, take some smoke for luck outside the shrine:p, do a lucky coin toss in front of the shrine and lastly get some lucky water at the side :)Short and sweet and you can go on to walk to sky tree :)"

Everything you see, you eat, and you buy will have the touch of Art. My suggestion is for those who don't have time or budget to visit Kyoto. then take times to stroll down and browse Asakusa. I remember coming here in the afternoon where stores are open and they sell unique Japanese souvenir, snacks, and clothes. Then on the next few days, I came again at night where almost all stores are closed in Shin Nakamise Dori, Nakamishe shopping street. I was a bit disappointed because I was planing to buy some souvenirs . But surprisingly, I experienced another cuteness of Japan where all the closed door of every stores are painted, and every store paints different pictures. I do buy some souvenirs, what I love buying souvenirs in Japan (also in here) Beside that they are cheaper than other places in Japan, they still care in their packaging. They will wrap whatever we buy in sweet little box, gift papers, and paper bags."

I found this area to be a great change from the towers and noise of Shibuya and Shinjuku. The temple is the oldest temple in the city, and the whole region represents an older part of Tokyo. The temple was busy but well worth a visit. The vendors on the street to the temple sell a wide variety of goods and foods. Some goods appear to be relatively cheaply made, mass produced souvenirs but others are much more interesting and unique. There are also some interesting shops on the side streets There are several small places to eat throughout the area. Try the Japanese sweet bread loaf in the small bakery to the right of the temple). I did not go to the Asahi beer building but it is easy to see from the Subway exit. Kappabashi street was a mass of local people with a few tourists intermixed in the crowds. There are great functional kitchen related items on this street that make great inexpensive souvenirs or Japanese gifts (knives, wooden bowls, baskets, hand cut class, and plastic food samples). Overall, this is a great part of Tokyo to visit for a morning that will provide a very different picture of the city (take the Ginza line subway to Asakusa)."

Was lovely to be able to have this experience again and walk around for a few hours in a kimono. Even though it was extremely touristy we were still able to find some space around the temples and gardens to get some great photos. Loved shopping for nick nacks as well. Overall it was a great place to have that kind of experience as it felt like quite traditional japan. There was a few people doing the same thing and everyone especially the older generation seemed to like that you would want to dress in their traditional dress."

All you have to do is that you walk away from the crowds on Nakamise and simply get lost.I personally think that the very best way for sight-seeing Asakusa and dodging those ongoing waves of tourists is to go and check out Sensou-ji and Kaminari-mon super early in the morning, have breakfast at one of the Kissa-tens (Japanese-style cafes if they are open), and then you begin wandering through the back streets. Otherwise, do vice versa (wander thru the back streets and check out Sensou-ji later on at night.) You'll be amazed by how uncrowded Asakusa is early in the morning and late at night.Additionally, don't be afraid walking into a restaurant, bars, etc,.with little or no ability in speaking Japanese as most local people and staff in Asakusa should be used to dealing with tourists. Get lost in translation. That's fun :-)"

Girls wander around dressed in kimono trying to look like Maiko, muscular men pull rickshaws for tourists, souvenirs shops, snacks shops, restaurants... It is all very touristy and a bit tacky, but such fun.We were looking for a yukata sash and found several for sale in the various kimono shops but they were quite expensive. Then we walked down Nakamise-Dori, lined with stalls selling souvenirs and religious items, the main approach to Senso-ji. Here we found several stalls at which to purchase the sash and we could bargain there and got an even better price.For some this whole area may just seem like Disneyland in the suburbs - it is definitely a tourist dominated site. Nevertheless, there are those who come to the temples to pay their respects."

However, I still had enough space to enjoy some of the surroundings, including very beautiful paintings on the road's wall leading up to the gate. The gates are massive and quite impressive, with bright hues of reds. The shrine itself (as most Japanese shrines) is closed to the public, but offers many options to show your appreciation with fortunes, wood ash wafting, and monetary donation.I bought a few things around some of the shops nearby and a couple traditional Japanese treats which were very good. I would suggest looking around the streets adjacent to the shrine before you set off on another destination. Also, I wouldn't go at peak time. It really was more relaxing around sunset when less people were around."

Asakusa is wonderful day or night, but the difference in atmosphere is significant, and warrents going twice or staying from mid-afternoon to post-twilight. The temple complex is beautiful and historic. The Sensou-ji Temple is Japan's oldest for commoners. The Asakusa shrine next to it (toward the river) dates the Tokugawa shogunate (built in 1649), as does the 300-year old gate leading to it. Other shrines, heat and small, are on all sides, in a small Japanese garden. The great gate leading to it, as well as the towering five story pagoda to the west, scream \"photo op.\". There are hordes of tourists answering that call. The lanes leading up to the great gate, and leading away from the area, are packed with stalls and shops, but you shop if you want; you're not harassed by hundreds of peddlers and \"guides\" as you would be at, say, the Mughal attractions of Agra or the Khmer ruins of Angkor Wat. With any luck you'll see kimonos a-plenty. November is the best time to see mothers in kimonos taking their three- and seven-year-old daughters to the shrines to give thanks for their good health, but I saw one mother and toddler daughter in Kimonos going to the Asakura shrine yesterday (perhaps thankful to have survived the typhoon that Tokyo earlier that day). I also saw a group of 20-year-olds. (3, 7, the 20-year coming-out and marriage day are the four traditional times Japanese women wear kimonos.)At sundown the merchants roll down there shutters, the tourists thin out a bit, and the Japanese lanterns all come on. Sensou-ji, pagoda, great gate are all illuminated, and the atmosphere is less animated, more serene. By the way, those storefronts don't lose their appeal when the shutters are down--they're all beautifully decorated with different Edo-period images. I'll post images of some main attractions by day and night, a typical Asakura storefront shuttered for the night, and an example of the Japanese lanterns at night--these were hanging over, of all things, the entrance to a parking lot on a side-street.To get there, go to Asakura station, exit A4, go around the block to the tourist center, take the lift to the 8th floor rooftop view to get your bearings, and off you go. Highest recommendation!"

I hate souvenir shops, so for me this place immediately ranks low as you have to go through/past several 100 shops to reach the temples.Quite interesting, this place combines a Buddhist temple and a shinto japanese religion temple in one location. Felt like the place was primarily visited by japanese, Korean and Chinese tour groups.Many lunch options there, so good to do temple plus lunch and then take the river cruise near the bridge going to Tokyo bay."

A neighborhood alive even till late evening, congested with tourists during the day, perhaps because of the presence of the top shine and temples here in Tokyo Asakusa. Really impressive both day and evening with the lighting, this is also open at night and you can walk through the streets of the different temples.

There are lot of small kiosk based shops around the temple, particularly on the way in from the Metro station selling all sorts of items from clothes and shoes to biscuits and ice-cream. At the temple itself you can have your fortune told by choosing a numbered stick and then receiving a piece of paper with the appropriately numbered fortune- it was very popular with the Japanese.

Well, you can see a little: the old temple Senso-Ji, other religious sites, and all the market stalls around it, are very beautiful and well worth a visit. It may be a bit disappointing though, as so much of old Edo has been burnt and destroyed. So, this is mainly a late twentieth century area, in terms of buildings. But, you do get a sense of Japanese tradition, and the area feels very Japanese in spite of the many tourists. It is also a very good place to shop, with a good range of Japanese goods."

When I first started traveling to Tokyo in 1989, I decided to live (for months on end) at a ryokan (a kind of rough \"inn\", tatame as a mattress and no pillows. Rooms divided up by rice paper walls and you're up at 5am , no matter what. It's because of the carps screaming (and they do scream loud just as cocks and hens), or because of the ryokan owner or manager is chucking out of your room. Then, it's quickly down to a Japanese breakfast (rice, salmon, seaweed, pumpkin and NO SIGHT of coffee) and, right after that, into a hot / boiling bath. And you MUST be out by 11am. The place is NOT a hotel so, you're encouraged to find things to do all day long.Asakusa is a Shinto district of Tokyo - not that far from Ueno Train Station, and it's traditional costumes and customs and eateries are notorious. This is the beauty of Japan: the old and the new, the super old and the super new, living side by side.Enjoy your stay.LOVEGerald Thomas"

Temple is one of the few you don't need to take your shoes off and can photograph. Garden area ok but nothing special. Good place to move on to the Sky Tree from. One stop across the road at the Asakusa station."

It has good train connections to the rest of Tokyo and sits at the end of Ginza metro line. A short walk brings you to Kaminarimon (Thunder) Gate - which is the famous one with the giant lantern hanging over the entrance. Inside is a narrow pedestrian street Nakamise which is lined with shops selling kitsch trinkets and snacks. At the end is one of Tokyo's best temples Senso-ji. It's a busy temple with people trying all sorts of good luck and fortune telling activities. Back near the metro station a bridge crosses the Sumida River from where you will have a great view of Tokyo Sky Tree and the unusual Asahi Building with the gold swirl on top."

One of my favourite parts of visiting there was being able to sit in on a ceremony of the blessing of objects.

Lots of kitsch, lots of food and a few lovely shops. Please be aware that not every item sold there is actually made in Japan, however. The main temple at the end is interesting, for sure, but there are also several other beautiful temples and statues in the surrounding area.

You can store large suitcases at your next hotel and just bring an overnight bag.Asakusa has many places to eat and shop, so apart from the shrine, take a walk around the place. Visit the shrine also in the evening when all the lights are on also. There is another place called akasaka, which is a different place. Asakusa is the last station on its line."

I stayed at Ryokan Kamogawa, a affordable Japanese style hotel in a great location in Asakusa. It was very easy to find, coming from the Asakusa (Ginza line) station.The Asakusa temple is one of the most popular tourist destinations, so there are the usual crowds. The Nakamise shopping street is crowded from the Kaminarimon gate to the temple with shops selling foods, souvenirs, cards, and stuff. The surrounding streets that parallel Nakamise st. have nice restaurants, nicer shops, bakeries, and a great place to get a massage. Across the street from the Thunder Gate (Kaminarimon Ave) is the Asakusa Tourism Cultural Information Center in a very modern building. They have English speaking help for tourists and a lot of local information. Very Helpful! They can tell you more about the 3 buses that run around Asakusa and have stops at attractions. I think they are free??? Tourist buses. I walked along the street that is the southern border of the Temple to Kappabashi Dogugai street (Pottery, restaurant equipment, kitchen wear) through the entertainment district, past 'Don Quiote', (a 6 floor food/department store), down narrow streets lined with residences and shops to Kappabashi. The Asakusa area I explored had enough English words to get by. I never had a problem communicating. The subways were easy if you paid attention. I'm going to stay in Asakusa my next trip to Tokyo."

Near to the Asakusa metro and train station, it is much more authentic then any others district. You are always in the shadow of the Skytree, that symbolizes the modern Tokyo, but here, here is different, it is like an other world....First, you find here the Sensoji temple with its 3 gates. The Buddhist temple was built in 645 A.D with the finest Japanese architecture. It is the oldest temple of Tokyo. Then you'll find the Five Storied Pagoda, built only about 40 years ago. It\u2019s about 50 meters high, a mixture of concrete, steel and a pillar of Japanese Cypress tree woo. Around is the Nakamise shopping area, it is principally for tourists, but still with a lot of special feelings, especially when you enter to the area from the magnificent Kaminarimon Gate. Alongside in the small streets, something diffrent is waiting for you, a real feeling of older Tokyo. Small houses, local shops, and a lot of stuff for kitchen. That's an other story here, the Kappabashi Dori, the so called \"kitchen street\" is a long main street with stores lined up on either side. You find everything here you could ever imagine about japanese kitchen...You have a lot of nice and sympahtic restaurants in this area, just behinde the Asakusa station building, you find really japanes restaurants with good prices. Just take about 15 bucks, 12 euros. you have a fantastic dinner/lunch. I even don't remember the name where I was, without English menu and any English word,only langauge of signs, with local draft beer and typical \"Tonkatsu\" served with shredded cabbage, boiled rice and miso soup. It was a bit down from the Station, but in the same street as Starbucks. Excellent chioce!!"

As first visitors to Tokyo, we were surprised by a couple of things. One was the huge number of bicycles that were in use. The other was how friendly and helpful local people were to us when we obviously were having trouble figuring something out such as the right subway or train to take. It made us want to return for an actual destination visit!"

Granted there are wonderful snacks aplenty and the temple with their giant lanterns at the gates are great for photos. But the real old Tokyo are the sidestreets around the temple with a myriad of shops that seem more untouched by tourism. A short walk from Nakamise street will take you to the river where you can see the distinctive Asahi building. From there, I slowly walked my way to the Skytree tower about 15mins away. A nice area to explore on foot if you have a few hours."

It's near Sumida River with its lovely promenades and Tokyo Sky Tree view --- very romantic at night. The Tobu Station provides easy access to Tokyo Sky Tree (just one station away) and the Nikko/Kinugawa area about 200km to the north of Tokyo. The Matsuya department store (same building as the Tobu station has a nice open-air rooftop with nice views of the surroundings, and on my last visit (Dec 2012), the rooftop had a Christmas tree and a free footbath, very pleasant experience under the bright winter sun."

Everyone was just walking along and some did not even bother looking at these shops. Others that were, just held up everyone else. Japanese are used to queuing so some eateries were not even open but the queue was already long. You queue for everything - even the fast food stall! The prices are also for the tourist - too expensive 500 yen ($5) for a grilled corn on the stick!!We asked one of the guards to let us out of the barriers as we just did not bother going into the temple.

It is located just west of the Sumida River (and you can visit this part of Tokyo by taking one of the River tour boats). It is also about a half mile west of the giant Tokyo Sky Tree.I visited this area on a Sunday afternoon in mid-November and thought it was interesting. The central part of this area is the Nakamise Street shopping arcade and the Senso-ji Temple and I spent almost my entire 3 hour visit here. While I only spent a few hours here and think it would be much better if I stayed overnight here so I could check it out after dark and walk through the back streets. If you are looking for lower priced souvenirs, Nakamise Street is the place to go. This street is directly in front of the Senso-ji Temple. There are lots of booths to buy souvenirs and snacks from. There are guys nearby that will give you a rickshaw ride for a price. I saw a young local couple that just got married getting a ride.Overall I thought this place was interesting and recommend it. It is a must see attraction if you are on your first visit to Tokyo (not sure if I would go back unless I was looking for cheaper Japanese souvenirs). Senso-ji Temple is in the center of this area and is the main attraction in Asakusa. The only issue I had with this area was the large number of tourists that made it feel like an amusement park and not an old part of Tokyo."

I stayed 5 days in Asakusa during my most recent trip to Tokyo and loved walking around at night and in the morning. Imado Shrine is a great small shrine to check out. It is a bit of a walk but if you walk along the Sumida Park whcih runs along the Sumida River you can enjoy a wonderful setting see some joggers, wild cats, birds and other interesting things. If you are curious about Maneki Neko or love cats this is the place to be.Kappabashi-dori is sensational if you have even a tiny interest in cooking. Kitchen town as it is known has great shops all dedicated to cooking. You will find very unique items for gifts or for your own Kitchen. Bandai, the famous toy maker has their home office in Asakusa and out front they have a lot of statues of some of their better known characters which is fun to see.Walking across the bridges can also be enjoyable as they are rather short and distinctive. Each bridge has its own cool style and they look great at night.Taking the Waterbus from Asakusa to Odaiba is really great as well. I really enjoyed it most at night as you can really see the beautiful city lights as you sit in comfort inside the ferry. They offer several different styles of ferries at different prices. If possible you may want to consider a visit during a festival or event. Asakusa has several famous ones and these can be great fun. I went to see \"Tokyo Jidai Matsuri\" and \"Shirasagi no mai\" both were great fun though busy.Of course the star of Asakusa is Sensoji and that is well deserved. It is a fantastic temple and Nakamise dori is a lot of fun to shop at you can get some great deals and delicious snacks walking along this area. Don't be afraid to walk the side streets though as there are tons more shops and places to eat as well as smaller shrines and temples around the area."

Many arcades, with little shops laden with souvenirs of dubious origin, but nice to look at. I walked towards \u201cKappabashi\u201d, Tokyo\u2019s main wholesale district for kitchenware, curious to find a reasonably priced sushi knife to bring home. This I did and to my amazement the shopkeeper had been to Greece (hitchhiking) many years ago. He also proceeded to declare his admiration for Alexander the Great! On leaving Kappabashi the rain had started again quite strong. Clad with my rainproof overcoat I walked back to the arcade area in search for a decent spot of lunch. There are numerous sake bars and eating places to choose from but I was looking for something with character, so I opted for a little corner place (\u2018kapilio\u2019 as we would say in Greece) run by two ladies. It was fun! By contrast to other street food places this one was quite unique; behind the bench the ladies were busy boiling various meats for the traditional stock. I chose to have grilled shiitake mushrooms and tofu with my beer. To my amazement and dismay the menu included whale meat sushi at an exorbitant price! All in all the district offers plenty of interesting things and before I headed for the train I bought a pair of authentic Japanese wooden clogs."

We thought Asakusa was such a perfect blend of modern and traditional Japan, and even Japanese kitsch. It remains a major tourist destination as well as a shopping heaven for those who enjoy walking streets and browsing small shops that sell everything from factory outlet shoes to exquisite hand-crafted gifts.Nakamise-street is wonderful for shopping due to the number of shops and its covered walkways. You can spend hours and hours checking out each store and dropping in quaint coffee shops. Shopping here is fun, and I found most shopowners and staff to be very pleasant to deal with. There is a definite tourist-service culture here.Of course, the highlight of Asakusa is Sensoji. It is a reflection of the strong Japanese culture that makes this country probably the most distinctive on earth in terms of a national identity. It is a vast complex that tourists descend upon throughout the day. Do a night visit and you will be amazed at how peaceful and magical the temple can be.I would choose to stay in this area as it is also very convenient to get to other places because of its two train stations. Take a walk a bit further and you find Sumida River. Not the most beautiful river scenery when compared to the likes of the Seine or the Chao Phraya, but refreshing nonetheless."

It has stalls side by side for about 300mt selling traditional but popular Japanese items like sake sets, sandals, kimonos, magnets, etc. and traditional snacks, which by the way, you cannot eat while walking but have to eat it right there a few steps from the entrance of the shop you bought it until you finish.It's a lovely and vivid walking you don't want to miss. You can spend there about 2 hours easily and then you can keep walking to Sumida river and then cross the bridge and go up to the sky tree.We went on late March when the cherry blossom was in full and the river looked absolutely magic with all those beautiful trees alongside and a few people walking or riding their bike.

Here you can get a detailed color map of the area and ask the friendly staff to point things out for you. The Tourist center also offers a free 1 hour tour twice a day which is a good way to get someone local to take you around.I had 2 hours in the area, I spent 30 minutes eating at the Tenya on Kamikarimon, then 1hr 30m wandering around the Senso-ji temple and the surrounding shrines, this was just barely enough time, I would suggest budgeting 3-4 hours to fully enjoy the area (including walking on all the side streets, lunch, etc.)."

But on a Sunday afternoon, I found the area to be relaxed and a great way to observe Japanese life and customs. There were religious ceremonies happening with families and children dressed in traditional outfits. And I was mesmerized by the Asakusa Shrine.There are rows of vendors selling various wares at Kappabashi market... some nice souvenir opportunities and local dessert treats.I probably did not take full advantage having done minimal research on this area, but found it to be a very enjoyable and relaxing afternoon.

            "review": "Well-preserved Corner of Old Tokyo. Asakusa is a famous hubbub of old Tokyo, representing a way of life that brings people in close contact for souvenirs and food. The center architectural attraction is the Senso Ji temple, Tokyo's oldest; the original structure was built in the 7th century. The adjacent shrine is a Shinto Buddhist shrine, the Asakusa shrine, built in 1727. The temples have been maintained beautifully. It is difficult to imagine the ideal Buddhist tranquility in the throngs of Asakusa, but all temples have an air of transcendence, and there is reverence and respect amongst the tourists here. We came in April on a day celebrated as Buddha's birthday. The cherry blossoms were riotous with fragrance and color, and volunteers handed out orchids to passers-by. At Asakusa, as in Ginza, people watching is a great sport. Ladies in fancy kimonos and young adults in manga clothing are commonly seen. There are a great variety of street vendors selling small eats, like octopus dumplings, red bean cakes, roasted chestnuts, mochi, ramen. The food is not cheap, to be sure, but it is great fun. There are stores selling vintage Japanese toys, Hello Kitty, postcards, candy, swords, handbags. The stores are close to each other and the lanes narrow, and it is crowded. Kids can get easily separated. There are some good restaurants as well. We had sushi and homemade tofu in one of the restaurants in a side street. The tuna was good quality and fresh. In all, Asakusa is a must see when in Tokyo."

The main attraction of this place is the Senso Ji temple and thousands of people come here to sight-see and shop at the four blocks of concession booths along the arcade. During peak seasons and sunny days, this place gets really crowded.My favorite time to visit this site is during cherry blossom seasons (mid-March to mid-April) and the winter months (less crowd).Accessibility: The site is wheelchair accessible. The majority of the path is paved in concrete and there is an elevator to the main temple (hidden on the left side of the building).Cherry Blossom: When you finish viewing the temple ground, I highly recommend you walk along the pedestrian path near the river (about 6 blocks east). From here, you can see Sky Tree, Asahi Beer building, and many sakura trees."

Asakusa is a dream destination, especially for first time visitors to Japan but its my third time here and I still love it.It is old Japan in architecture, food, temples, history, cultural significance etc etc. it's a very beautiful place, great for photos and you can enjoy it day and night.There is a couple of public bath options, hundreds of restaurants and all variety, great shopping, both touristy and just good shopping as well as having lots of street food.The place is very busy because its very popular with Japanese domestic tourists but there plenty of room for everyone.Probably the only down side is that its not on a JR line so you can't use you JR pass for the train from the station for a couple of stops but its only a couple of dollars each time.Location to greater Tokyo is easy with Akihabara, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Harajuku, Ginza all easy by train. The Sumidagawa river is right there as well so you can take a ferrie.The new Tokyo sky tree is in Asakusa as well which is a great view point and shopping centre.It's certainly not a party areas but there are some izakaya for a drink. It can be a great place to stay but is a destination for a day trip in its own right if staying somewhere else."

The place is the actual representation of Japan (since this is the oldest temple in Tokyo). Before reaching Sensoji Temple, you will pass through the Nakamise-dori. It's a street full of omise (store) selling different stuffs like Kimono (Japanese traditional garment), okashi (Japanese sweets), and lot of souvenirs that you can only see in Asakusa. After passing through Nakamise-dori,you will easily see the Sensoji Temple. There's an incense urn where lots of people are gathering.Japanese believes that the incense smoke from the urn will make you smart. Also there is the dragon faucet,where people either drink or wash their hands (it is a belief that it brings luck and prosperity). Then the last is inside the Sensoji temple,where you can offer your prayers and respect. You can throw coins before offering a prayer.When going to Asakusa, don't forget to bring your camera or video camera. Don't worry because the place might be crowded (especially along the Nakamise-dori) but when you are already there,you'll feel that you just have to enjoy the crowd. If you plan on buying something, bring extra money since the prices are quite high. Foods? There are lot of food stands inside but also the prices are quite high. The best day to go to Asakusa is during weekdays since the place is not that crowded. Although I've been to Asakusa twice,I'm not getting sick yet of going again especially during events and festivals. I'm sure I will come back to Asakusa some time."

Miso flavoured ice cream, rice balls with miso paste, shopping for kimono, Studio Ghibli store, Kappabashi-dori kitchenware and \"fake food\" street, and ukiyo-e prints - we spent a day just wandering the streets of Asakusa and were much delighted by what we found. A bit touristy perhaps, but take some of it with a grain of salt, and it is lovely to behold. The tourist information centre is very good, plus they have a wonderful viewing platform which gives you amazing views of Tokyo Sky Tree and the street leading up to the shrine."

            "review": "Can't get enough of this place!. Asakusa is one of the most atmospheric areas in Tokyo and an absolute must see for anyone who only has a short stay in this amazing city. The main attraction is the Senso-ji temple however the whole area is bursting with things to see and do. Yes, it is very touristy but isn't that the case with most popular and well loved places? I have now been here on 2 occasions, once on a weekday and another just last weekend. Go on a weekday if you prefer less crowds. Even on a cold winters day, Asakusa was teeming with people on a Saturday and progress up the Nakamise-dori shopping street moved at a snails pace (although this may only be because it was the week after New Years Day when 1000s of locals visit the Shrine for their New year blessing). However the advantage of going on a weekend is all the additional food stalls surrounding Senso-ji Temple that aren't there on a week day creating a really carnival like atmosphere. These stalls sell an incredible array of food I don't see at home like skewered whole fish on hot coals, multicoloured choc coated bananas and amazing omelette styled dishes full of goodies cooked on a huge grill.Explore the backstreets and you will find heaps of restaurants to suit all budgets including street stall like operations packed with locals.There are also a lot of artisans selling their crafts.Not far from the Senso-ji Temple is a small amusement park. Opposite the huge entrance gates leading to Sensoji is a funky and modern design wood and black steel 8 storey building which houses a Tourist Information Centre and won a design award in 2012. Take the time to go to the 8th floor to get a more aerial view not just of Senso-ji and Nakamise-dori shopping street but also the impressive modern architecture to the right including the Phillip Starke designed building with the unusual gold formation on top . At sunset, this is magical with the sun bouncing off the gold facades of the buildings (see photos). There is a small cafe on the 8th floor.Also in Asakusa is a Drum Museum and the reknown Kappabashi-dori street that sells kitchen gear and all the plastic food models you see in Japanese restaurants.So in short this spot has something for everyone and is easily accessible by subway."

I recommend renting a bike there, which is extremely cheap(a few dollars for the day) . The bike place is located near the boat tour building, but you have to go down a ramp where they have hundreds of bikes. They don't speak much english, if any. Bikes are a great way to get around Tokyo since its so spread out. I took mine over to Akihabara(Electronic City. I really liked Asakusa because of the flea market type setup called Nakamise Street as you walk to the temple. There is a ton of cool and interesting sweets to buy. Also, they have just finished building the Tokyo Skytree across the river. It is one of the tallest buildings in the world and will offer amazing views of Tokyo, as well as many new restaurants and shops. Be sure to get over there is you are in Asakusa.You can also catch a nice tour boat from Asakusa. I recommend taking the boat to Odaiba which is an island full of shopping, restaurants, and the Toyota showroom, and a giant ferris wheel. The boat itself is amazing and well worth it."

In fact you can buy these snacks at narita airport at 5% less at the departure area as it is tax free( Japan has a 5% VAT tax).

Simple street snacks now cost a fortune and the traditional kimono and Japanese goods have been replaced with cheap and garish Made-in-China products. The Senso-ji and the various temples and shrines surrounding it are beautiful examples of Japanese architecture, and still worth a visit.

Sensoji temple and the markets surrounding are a great place to visit. Souvenirs can be bought and delicacies such as Taiyaki are available. Be sure to try the pineapple cream cheese ones as well as the red bean original ones. I can\u2019t express how good and different they are in comparison to ones we have in Perth.There are a couple of 100 yen stores around where you can find all sorts of goodies. It\u2019s similar to the $2 shops in Australia only 100 times better, with quality products and gifts. If you\u2019re looking for Tokyo fashion such as harajuku styles or people dressed similarly you won\u2019t find them in this area.Since Asakusa is well located, you can jump on multiple train lines to Ueno, Akihabara and Shibuya (30mins).

We advise not to take a tour but go there by taxi or underground, because you need more time to visit the smaller temples and parks around the main temple. The smaller temples and parks are much nicer and quieter than the main one. And thus will give you a far better experience."

My girlfriend and I visited Asakusa on the last day of our Japan trip in February this year.Other than Sensoji and the Kaminarimon, I originally did not expect much of this area and was greatly surprised to find out how much there was in store. You get immersed in local culture pretty much immediately upon leaving the station (in my opinion, more than Kyoto) and you'll find the atmosphere very relaxing and welcoming. The shopping streets, like Nakamise, are also filled with interesting local goods. All that easily made Asakusa the favorite part of my trip.Duration-wise, we spent about 4 hours in the area, including a 60 minute rickshaw ride and 2 - 2.5 hours in the Sensoji area at a comfortable pace. I advise allotting more time (about half a day in total) if planning to explore more of the area by foot.Good points:- Great cultural feel- Numerous shops selling traditional food and souvenirs in the area- Interesting juxtaposition of the new (modern buildings) and old (traditional temples, etc.) especially when they're often side by sideBad points:- Casual tourists might miss smaller but still noteworthy places of interest (e.g. Hanayashiki, a theme park; taikokan, a drum museum, etc.)Others:- If your budget allows, try the rickshaw ride near the station exit. It is pricey, but the experience is amazing and the guide is friendly and informative (they speak English too) - we got to learn a lot more like the old Japanese theme park, the area's history (and a lot of those statues around that we probably wouldn't have noticed otherwise). The guides are humorous too!"

When you first walk into the alley that leads to the shrine it's literally a shock, tiny stalls lined with usual tourist goods as well traditional sweet stalls and craft shops, all reasonable prices if you want to buy gifts for friends or relatives. I would recommend doing the temple first before browsing the stalls! When you first walk into the shrine there is a huge urn burning a smokey intense, which fills the air, as well as chanting, girls in kimonos, and monks. In all my travels I've never seen something as unique. The Temple is a gasping red colour with lanterns on every corner, and there as lots of separate pagodas and outbuildings as well as floral and statue displays. If you go into the main temple you can see the monks performing Buddhist rituals and chants, which is fascinating! After leaving the temple I felt somewhat enlightened and was by far one of the highlights of my trip! Do this first as it will get you excited for what else Tokyo has to offer!"

I had a plan to buy a vintage kimono and a 'window sample' - plastic food like you have never seen before! We got close to Senso-ji temple by subway, then walked through delightful streets to the area around the temple, which had some very nice market stalls. The shop I had researched for kimonos didn't have great stuff, but just around the corner, next to an ice-cream shop was a store that makes new kimonos and there was a wee sign in the window that they had vintage ones upstairs. 90 minutes later I was having an ice-cream and the proud owner of two beautiful kimonos (one hand-painted), with obi, zori and some hair pieces - all to hang on my wall at home. The lady was wonderful and her prices were ok - competitive I would say. We communicated in sign language and through the APP on my smartphone! Next we visited the temple, which was the most crowded of any I had seen in Tokyo (we hadn't visited Kyoto at that stage so hadn't experienced the crowds there!). It is gorgeous though. After that, we used the guide book to navigate through a busy narrow laned area to Kappabashi Street, where you could buy anything in the world for your kitchen or restaurant. We finally found the three or four shops selling window samples - they are perfect replicas of Japanese meals, made entirely of plastic. You simply cannot understand why your nose can't smell the food! They look so REAL! Pretty pricey, but we bought a small piece. A great afternoon in Asakusa."

However, I have to disagree with some of the other reviews in terms of the prices here--I went around quite a lot of cities around Japan and I found the prices for things in Asakusa to be significantly cheaper than what you can find elsewhere. Just keep in mind that if you see something you like, keep walking a little bit further and you might just find it for a few hundred yen cheaper. If not, then walk back! I also found the area quite easy to navigate since it all seems to lead to the same main street. Lastly, the shrine and temple complex is gorgeous, of course. Great photo opportunities."

So we brought along small luggages. When my aunt from the US and I went to Asakusa, we were curious of the place. We didn't realize we will shop. We did with gusto...we got 3 pants 4 blouses, 2 shoes, 3 bags. Of course we did have a very good lunch of Udon in one of the side streets. So to the tourists...bring some cash...you will really find good bargains and good food."

The downside of this is that Asakusa is the token \"Japanese temple\" for most tourists. You will walk through the long row of sales booths with typical tourist items before you get to the temple itself, but if you've never been here before, don't let it deter you (in fact it can be fun looking at the items). Asakusa is definitely worth visiting, but I haven't been back on my many trips to Tokyo.If you want to see something interesting nearby, walk about 10-15 minutes to the west to Kappabashi street, which is where restaurants go to buy their supplies - signs, cookware, serving ware, and....plastic food for display! You can find great prices on cheaper lacquer ware or bowls, but I always go to look at the artistry of the plastic food (and buy some!)."

If you can get a good shot of Kaminarimon during a weekend, then you are truly blessed. The highlight is of course the infamous red giant lantern which hangs outside the Sensoji Templec) Sensoji Temple - beautiful temple with locals praying. Before entering it is advised to follow the local custom of washing your handsd) Nakamise Dori (Street)- in my opinion, the highlight of Asakusa. On weekends, it is jam packed with locals. This is where you can have the local delights such as tempura, small cake with red bean paste and even ice cream. This is also the best place to do your souvenir shopping as every stall offer different, eye catching are the souvenirs that you can purchase such as various trinkets, key chains, sculptures, masks, figurines, yukatas, T-shirts and so on.

The Sumida riverside walk with cherry trees was also great, we did this again in the evening when the lanterns and trees were lit up. The Tokyo Sky Tree dominates the skyline here, and the Asahi \"golden poo\"! If you go the other way from the temple (away from the river) you get to a main street which is lined with shops selling kitchenware - we enjoyed a browse here to look at pottery and ceramics, knives and all the enormous variety of utensils etc used in Japan.

Please pray here like Japanese do. There are nice Japanese, French and Italian restautrants. In Spring, the cherry blossoms are beautiful along the Sumida River near there. Let's get on the ferry and head for the Hama-Rikyu Garden."

Nonetheless, the place was very interesting amongst the hustle bustle of little souvenir and bakery shops before the ancient majestic shrine and pagoda display before you. The landscape and architecture were amazing with a mix of historical appreciation. With the walking distance, there were also some unique eateries for those who are keen to try out but on the pricey side since this is a touristy location. We spent a good 2 hrs here exploring the nearby places as well which has the famous young troops all dressed up for Cosplay!

If you have time, venture further west on Asakusa Dori (near the Tawaramachi station for the Ginza line) to find stores selling traditional ceremonial items for Obon, Japan's August holiday to honor the return of ancestors' spirits. Continue to the corner of Asakusa Dori and Kappabashi Dori for household goods shopping. There are two store on the corners (Dr. Goods and Dengama) that offer items nicely priced.

We arrived from the plane, clear custom and down we went striaght to the train that takes us downtown. It took us about an hour and it was just merely JPY1000. We decided to stay at Asaukusa as I heard so much nice things about it. One of the comment was that Asakusa being the oldest place in Japan and viewing cherry blossom was the right place to be.So, we took the chance after much research and emails, we book a hotel there. It was rather hard to find a typical ryokan. Nearly everywhere I tried looking at Asakusa was fully book because of the cherry blossom season. Luckily, we found hotel gyminso. They offered me a Japanese style room facing the Sumida River & park. It was awesome. It was already dark when we arrived from the airport but we could see the whole row of cherry blossom trees just outside from our window. It was really pink everywhere. So pretty! Not only that, the hotel is clean, close to all the subways and just across Tobu train station. It is a stone throw to the attractions and the view is just breathtaking during spring.The next morning, we spent the whole morning just walking up and down at Sumida Park, enjoying the beautiful cherry blossoms. Later in the morning, we walked down to visit Sensoji Temple & Nakamise street. It was a crowded place with lots of small shops selling Japaneses items. After lunch, we took a cruise ride from the Sumida Park pier to Hamrikyu gardens. The boat ride took just 30 minutes where we could see the various types of bridges along the river and of course cherry blossom trees. The japanese garden landscape was interesting but did not have as many cherry blossom trees to see as the Sumida Park.There are many small food stores everywhere. There are many category of food to choose from but we preferred the typical soba noodles the small shops have to offer. A must try.View my pictures online. at http://babyforshee.blogspot.com I have a video to watch as well. BTW, you can also see nice cherry blossoms at Ueno Park as well. Just be aware that anywhere you go, there will be lots of people everywhere.Enjoy...April 2007"
