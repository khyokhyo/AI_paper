People can be persuasive and continue to talk to you when you have said you aren't interested which we found annoying but it was something we ignored. It's an exciting and vibrant part of Marrakech and worth a visit. Ideally I would recommend staying in a Riad closeby and go to the restaurants at night."

This maze of alleyways and impasses will treat your eyes with a feast of colour, spices piled high in perfect pyramids every colour, under the sun, cumin and coriander, pumice and pumpkin, textiles and pashminas, carpets and rugs, copper and silver, nothing terribly valuable but all terribly overvalued by their sellers. Bargain them down, then walk away disinterested. They'll come running after you with a new offer. In three hours, I got a carpet I really wanted down from \u20ac2000 to \u20ac200. It now adorns my entrance hall with warmth and colour and happy memories."

I have visited the Medina countless times, but with a professional guide one really discovers fascinating, hidden parts - like where they make the babouche slippers, or auction the leather. Ask your hotel for a guide that knows the medina well, and make it very clear that you will not be buying any products from his recommended shops - as often one loses too much time being sold too. Best to say you just want to experience the souk - you can shop later on your own without the pressure."

The atmosphere is extrodinary with several things happening. There is so much colour and brightness in the Medina of Marrakesh with restaurants, shops and sightseeing. There are donkeys walking across the road with you. Overall I really enjoyed the experience and the people of Marrakesh are extremely friendly and welcoming. Especially at night where their is lanterns to bright up the square."

The worse is the monkeys on the chains. It is horrible to see them tugging at the chain to be released. Many tourists do not see the sadness of the monkeys and think they are cute. Please be a responsible traveler and avoid these animal abusers at all cost. Be smart. Do your research first. Ask questions. Look at the animal. Does it look happy and healthy? Please do this before getting involved with any animal exploitation. Wether it be horse riding, camel riding, elephant riding, dolphin riding, etc. Some animals are not meant to be ridden. Some are but are overused for the day. These are not animals not machines."

Its one of the largest historic town centers in Morroc and its really impressive to discover the streets with all the tiny shops and cafes. Some of this shops or businesses survived since hundred years and more and are still in use. Fascinating!We felt very save with regard to pocket picker and beggars we saw just very few. We have been warned from aggressiv kids, but didn't see them either. Beware: except very few restaurants or the Riads the entire area is an alcohol free zone!"

At night it's a different atmosphere, the square is full of music and food stalls. Be careful when going through the souks, I wouldn't only recommending the souks during the day as it can be intimidating at night. I wasn't surprised by the chaos as I've visited similar places. The shops are pushy, if you're not interested don't make eye contact or say no immediately. They love to barter, literally make sure you pay at least half of what they originally ask. Don't let the henna ladies get near you. Even if you tell them you have no money they say ok do the henna and then cause a scene when they want paying and will follow you everywhere.Also saw a man having a poo in the busy street, bits and all. Not nice with young children around"

            "review": "Perfect 4 nights. As other reviewers this was an amazing holiday with amazing weather.. so thought will add notes that may or may not help. But Never the less enjoy.Firstly WITHOUT FAIL PRINT your boarding passes.. although these budget airlines from UK accept boarding pass on apps and internet when coming back.. Marrakech airport DO NOT accept this and will want paper ones. Otherwise a lady is there and will charge you \u00a315.00 and that is the exact price for now... ( if you have forgotton to print ask your hotel to print this off before you depart)Another thing HAVE A PEN !!Boarding pass needs to be filled in both ways coming and going and the very moment you need a pen there isnt one insight!Before boarding even though you may have checked in online and have your paper ready to go you still need to go to check in to verify your boarding passes.MONEY-The best way to exchange money is do enough for a taxi at the airport...and definitely the rest at your destination in local banks.. you will get much more than the airport rates!! Example Current offer was \u00a31 = 11.5 DHS at airport and 11.82 DHS outside airport Taxi is available everywhere just make sure you bargain and fix your price before getting inside.Excursions..If you dont want to ruin your trip and just for a little less savings.. TRUST me use a well established respected travel agent for your excursions.People on the streets randomly call out to you to book excursions and usually 90% of the time these are companies that do have a travel agent but when looking at reviews people have had a bad time for many reasons. Another thing an excursion for example to Atlas Mountain they will qoute say 180-250 DHS...but for near enough the same amount 200-250 DHS you can still have a fantastic time with a reputable company.If it helps when you are there do a review to check before booking anything.Doing the very thing I booked to go with Marrakech tours who had no people on the streets trying to drag you in. I just saw an A board and decided to review this....they qouted us 250 for a trip to mount atlas but ofcourse I haggled and got this to 200 DHS per person.Alternatively you can take a GRAND Taxi the only difference is there will be no tour guide-- if you are an person who likes to take on information listen to talks learn about culture etc then book with a travel agent.. otherwise once you are there every one is going in the same direction so follow through.. IMPORTANT again without fail wear the correct footwear as technically you are going hiking.Plenty of food places to eat from and some even offer sheesha.Shopping Plenty of UK high street shops at Guillez but i found the price is much more than uk.Souks now be prepared to haggel this is now a tradition and so be patient cos they can sometimes sound very aggressive.Food- Plenty of food options around at night in the square outdoor barbecue type food stalls are set up and good luck trying to pass through them.Sheesha- place in Medina called La Selema which is at the turning just before you see a restaurant called Cafe de France.. they only have two flavours mint and apple cost is 150 DHS they do a tappas menu which I thought was decent portions ( but not if your a big eater )CHARITY.throughout your journey you will see adults children begging for money either asking for it or selling small items from tissues. Ofcourse Charity does not decrease your wealth and give as you wish but just a tiny note.. little kids do melt your heart and I easily felt sorry for them and natrually gave them more than anyone else.. but then i find out its is far better to give your change or charity to the families that have signs displayed they are from syria as they are more needy ( ofcourse God knows best)These kids who have these cheeky smiles and faces have chosen not to go school are able to eat do have roof over the heads and basically spend their time in getting money or free food.At marrakech airport if you want to purchase anything from duty free its only pounds or euros so dont try to carry any back thinking you can use this."

            "review": "Just unsure....mixed feelings. After reading many guides about Marrakesh, I thought I was ready for the Medina and souk market....but it didn't prepare me enough. I dressed appropriately covering shoulders and knees. Wore sunglasses to make as little eye contact as possible. I walked around with my partner at all time.... that was not enough, you still get harassed! If you even dare looking at a store...boom they catch you and don't let go. The first morning was hard. If you start looking at your map the youngsters jump on you to give you directions. Without realising it one youngster pointed out the direction of our Riad. We said thank you and went. Within minutes he was following us \"helping\" to get there. We tried to get away from him telling him we knew where to go, even walked into a spa, hoping he would disappear. No chance. As we arrived at our Riad, he asked for money. We said no. He kept insisting. My partner reached for a few coins in his pocket (5dn) he said no I want 100. We told him this or nothing.... the Riad manager opened the door and we jumped in. He got rid of them. I felt very scared to leave the riad in case they were stil outside. We went out in the evening, much more assertive this time.Don t be scared to say NO and keep walking. If anyone is trying to give you directions just say you know where you are and carry on checking your map. Just ignore them.The souk itself is very vibrant and you can get things very cheap if you keep haggling."

As we were two women on our own we were pounced on by a dirty so called official tour guide who was hard to shake off even though we kept saying we had no money & he was intent on taking us where we didn\u2019t want to go. If not careful you will find yourself in a labyrinth of complicated irregular network of passages & alleys in which it is difficult to find one's way; a maze. Cars are too wide for the alleys but the wider streets allow cars to mix with the pedestrians, bicycles, mopeds, donkey carts and more.If you do not like getting lost in a maze, don't leave the \"beaten track\" The downsides are widely known - being approached by men with monkeys on leashes, snakes who they try to wrap round you & not forgetting the henna tattooists. Suggest you keep your hands to yourself to avoid unwanted Henna ladies who will try & grab your hand to ply their trade. Therefore keep pointing to a minimum to avoid attention."

Shoes, clothing, silverware, leather goods, spices, foods, rugs, fresh meats, craftsman of all types including the hard working men in the tannery. It's all so amazing! If I were to give a suggestion it would be to try and pay attention to what's going on around you. While we tourist walk around all Google Eyed, people are hard at work in the Medina and you may find yourself standing in the way of a heavenly loaded animal headed down one of the narrow alleys. I may be writing it wrong but if you hear someone hollering \"Bulack\" it means get out of the way, don't think about it just move quickly to the side before you have an up close personal introduction to a not so happy beast of burden.It's an amazing place to visit."

Try to explore Medina during the day and taste the food in the night, you can go back once, twice doesn't matter, the taxi fare from Train station to Medina for one person during the day is 20-30dhm, so stick to this fare before you go in a taxi."

The souks sell everything from fancy scarfs and bags to household items. The main drags are more touristy, the side cuts are less so, and the prices vary accordingly. One thing you must do is haggle and haggle hard. The sellers are friendly and often a bit cheeky but it is all part of the fun. And at nighttime, as the sun sets, the square comes to life. Snake charmers, henna ladies and most of all, food stalls set up. The food is nice, almost the same everywhere so no matter which one you pick in general. It is safe to eat too. Been 3 years in a row and always came back with a full and healthy stomach. Its hustle and bustle is entertaining and make sure you check out one of the nearby rooftop terrace cafes for a drink."

If you have time, do explore the streets and get lost while doing so. You will definitely have fun trying to figure out the maze and enjoy the beautiful sights of the city. The people of the city were also very friendly and approachable even if they spoke minimal English. They will go all out to ensure that you are fine and taken care of. In terms of shopping, do be careful of scam artists and beggars. The scam artists may approach you and pull your hand to give a \"sample\" but you will end up paying for the said \"sample\". Thus, be careful and not fall or allow them to give you a \"sample\". I witnessed a women approached family with two small kids. As the parents were momentarily distracted when purchasing food, the scam artist went to their toddler and put on a bracelet on her left wrist. The scam artist then continued to say how pretty it was. Thereafter when the parents wanted to take it off as they did not want to purchase it, the scam artist tighten the bracelet making it impossible to take it out. The said parents had to pay 50 dirhams for it as apparently, they had \"spoilt\" it when trying to take it off.Additionally, the moment you give a beggar some cash, more beggars will approach you. As such, be mindful of your surroundings. I had no issues with the bargaining of prices as they were more honest with us who were Muslims. They did not quote too high of a price and furthermore, they did not know my country well which helped in the process too. In terms of the day tours, please be noted that the tour price only includes the drive to the location. You will still have to pay for the guide at the attraction itself. Usually a tour guide will cost about 20 - 30 dirhams each person depending on the attraction. They will bring you to an expensive restaurant where the food will cost at least 100 dirham for each person. The food cost, tour cost and any additional ride or item are not included so be prepared to pay more. My advise is to not purchase shared tours online or beforehand as the prices are more expensive. Unless you wish to go for a private tour that is. I paid at least 400 dirhams more per person for booking the trip online instead."

Our hotel organised a private guide to take us to the Medina and we had a fabulous 5 hours walking around and exploring the little back streets and many stalls the Medina has to offer. Some parts can be eye opening and may be distressing for some (think monkeys in nappies with leads on being lead around in the hot sun for tourists to have photos with and chickens being killed in public view in the food market) and you should be prepared to barter with the shop owners to get the best bargains but otherwise this is a great introduction to Moroccan culture. We will definitely return again but we would always take a guide with us."

Walk into the narrow corridors and streets of this breathtaking Medina. a marketplace of colour, smell and one that will tantalise your taste buds, hearing and sense of smell with so much to see. This is a maze, so take a good large scale map with you. Google maps on your phone do work so track your walk and then you can find your way back. This is an amazing place. The locals can be a bit pushy about showing you where the square is or the tannery. if you want or do use them, fine. But just a word of caution, they will ask you for money and will get stroppy when you decline. most will seem friendly enough and they appear to be just helping, its not the case. Sadly, they are making the Medina less desirable than it was ten years ago. ( just say no thank you and move on- if they stay with you, just walk into one of the shops and wait for them to move on ) Take comfortable walking shoes and be careful of the scooters and cyclists as well as cars and lorries that can come through these small streets at speed. There is so much to see and always bargain for what you want and don't be pressured into buying what you don't want. if you walk away the price will drop and if not, there is another shop very close by that has all the same stuff where you can try bargaining again. A lot of fake goods here and it is a real shame that there now appears to be a lot of imported Chinese clothing and cheap plastic toys and implements taking over. The Tannery is worth a visit and there are guides at the doors to try and \u00a8guide you\u00a8fine if you want to spend 200 Dirhams, ( about 18 quid) for a few minutes in the Tannery and a brisk march to the carpet and leather shop. They all work together to fleece you of your cash.....it\u00b4s the way they earn a living...so accept it for what it is and enjoy it ....."

The Medina can be totally chaotic at times. There are many stalls in the souks where it would have even lovely to browse in were it not for the continual bombardment of traffic, mainly motorbikes. There are a lot of donkey carts, hand carts and bicycles to dodge but the motorbikes in the narrow walkways are a menace. The tourist authorities in Marrakech need to clamp down on this before it puts visitors off altogether.The shopping is exciting and the square after dark is magical. There are beggars and feral cats about. It is easy to get lost as the roads have few labels and the local maps are bad. Having said that part of the charm is to get lost in the ancient Souks. Be aware the Moroccans are very friendly and will help you if they can. We had trouble with the occasional lads who guided you to your destination and expected a large tip and also took you 'around the houses'. Also some lads don't know where they are, and guess badly where to guide you. The best way to navigate is to use the shape of the lanes and squares and ask vendors directions. If I go again I will take a compass!The medina is an unforgettable experience of North African life. We felt very safe. Just watch your back!"

Our riad Riad Dar Grawa was wonderful.However, we were approached at least 4 times per day by local con artists trying to 'guide' us (for money), take us to their uncles carpet/trinket/leather/spice shop (for money), show us an alternative route when a route was closed (for money) although the route was not closed, and even assist our taxi driver in finding our riad (for money).It is clear that there is much poverty in Marrakech so locals are looking for ways to earn money, but the overall feeling as a tourist was of being targeted for money to deliver services that weren't required. Some of you inhabitants of Marrakech have let your city and your country down.Left a bitter taste for us and we won't visit again even though we stayed in a lovely riad and visted some beautiful and interesting places."

As long as you are able to ignore locals calls towards there stalls or there asks for 'help' you will be just fine. Make sure you know where you are going and have your own prices in mind for things to buy. Asking for directions is not a good idea, as they may charge you for it. Prices they quote you for a thing you want to buy maybe more than three times what they actually will charge you after the haggling.

Variety of fruits are on sale along with fruit juice.But as per the guide we were asked to avoid this as the local water is bound to cause stomach upset. Beware of taking photo of persons without their permission. This applies to all over Morocco."

Just book yourself into a calm hotel room after!"

Expect to get overcharged by massive amounts unless you're a bit careful....get a little advice from your Riad manager or staff on what you SHOULD pay for particular items you're looking for to buy and take home! There are a couple of co-operative wher4 everything is genuine, hand made, and reasonably priced...they'll give you a great idea of general prices. Beware of people who are doing \"unofficial guiding\" around the Medina, which is illegal in Morocco! Feel free to give them a little money if they're nice and helpful but don't ever give them what they ask...use personal discretion. Apart from that enjoy the haggling on the stalls (you'll get much better prices if you are firm with what you are willing to spend...if you're being pressured just smile, say thank you and politely leave - you'll find the same stuff in a hundred other stalls so don't worry!). Try the food stalls here and there for something quick and simple..the food is largely well cooked and a little more \"Moroccan\" than some of the more tourist-oriented restaurants, but we weren't disappointed with anything we had while there for a week.Take the time to really take in the ornate decoration on the buildings and old furniture etc..so lovely! Try a sunset meal on one of the roof terrace restaurants for a lovely view of the square as all the lights are coming on on the stalls and the smells of cooking are beginning to swirl around!"

Make sure you haggle (start at 30% of the original price according to our guide!) before buying anything. And if you don't intend to buy a merchandise, don't bother asking or the vendor will insist on you buying the item you asked, to the point of following you.

The old, walled Medina remains the heart of Marrakesh and is a must see sight in North Africa, although that does not mean it's always pleasant. It is where the medieval world meets the modern life. The winding alleys, ancient architecture, decorated mosques and bustling souks are the backdrop for daily life continuing here as it has for centuries. However, that means that as well as being interesting and at times beautiful, it is also dirty, smelly and challenging to maneuver, with some annoying touts and related frustrations. But that is because it is a real place with real people, not just an artificial or soulless recreation. It was substantially bigger than I expected. It was also frankly much less touristy than other impressive ancient sights throughout the world (although much activity is focused on the tourist industry, there are substantially more local people around - or Moroccans visiting from other cities - than foreign tourists). Not much left like this in the world, but I can see why it turns off some tourists who are hoping for a hassle free, packaged and antiseptic experience."

It can be quite overwhelming at first as it is crazy busy, I had read reviews and thought I knew what to expect but really nothing can prepare you. Literally an overload for the senses! At night the square is lit up with entertainers, dancers, musicians as well as the usual food stalls and market sellers. By day it is more tame but still so busy! You WILL get lost, no doubt about it, but that is the magic of it :) Some top tips...\u2022 Do not let yourself get taken in by henna ladies! Within 5 mins of our first trip to the Medina I had a lady trying to sell me a henna tattoo, and before I could even choose one from her book she had drawn her own design up my arm and then charged me 100MAD for it (this was after bartering!!)\u2022 Don't go near to the monkeys if you don't want a picture with them. I personally found it very sad to see chained monkeys, but as soon as you walk near them the guys put them on your shoulder and get you to have a photo- they did this to my boyfriend and again we were made to pay a ridiculous price! \u2022 Barter and haggle to your hearts content :) a good tip I learnt is to say your final price, and then walk away, if the seller has a genuine price set they will let you walk away, if their price was too much they will call you back and continue to barter with you. \u2022 wear sunglasses and don't get eye contact if you don't want to get called to.\u2022 females- definitely cover up if you don't want to stand out. Embrace the dressing modestly culture! You can find some beautiful clothes there too, if you want to feel more comfortable a head scarf wouldn't be a bad idea but definitely not necessary. \u2022 Bring some coins if you want to take photos of the stalls (you definitely will!!) bring various denominations of cash to make it easier to haggle. \u2022 A cab from anywhere in town should be no more than 15-20 MAD/ dirham. We didn't learn this till a few days in and believe me the taxi drivers are more than happy to rip off tourists! Especially if going to or from a nice hotel! Definitely confirm a price before getting in the cab. \u2022 if you need directions ask a stall owner rather than a local stranger as they may lead you somewhere and try to charge you.\u2022 keep your eyes and ears peeled as motorbike / scooter drivers go crazy down the market alleys! \u2022 lovey Moroccan restaurants around the edges, most with rooftop views.\u2022 Enjoy and get lost! There really is nowhere else like it :)"

The streets throughout the medina are small, not generally named, and can be busy with people, animals and the every present moped/scooter careening around right corners. Just be careful of the scooters as some go very fast. During the day it's a different experience than at night. And depending where you are, it can be a little intense with the locals pursuing you to buy something - just say no and keep moving, otherwise you can easily feel infringed. I did not buy anything there as all the merchandise looked like it came out of a shipping container from China. Otherwise a central experience you need to do and whether or not you like it will depend upon how open you are to letting yourself emerge into it."

Wandering through the medina can be an amazing experience if you are in the right mood - there\u00b4s a lot going on there so you should be ready to be surrounded by crowds, to be approached by the Morrocans and to absorb a thousand of impressions at once. Despite the popular belief, apart from the pickopocketers, there is nothing to worry about (even for solo women) if you just follow a couple of basic rules: 1) dress appropriately (loose clothes, long sleeves and long pants), 2) walk on the right side of the street at all times, 3) stay concious of your surroundings and take good care of your valuables, 4) don\u00b4t even start discussing the price of something you are not interested in buying, 5) don\u00b4t stay out at late evenings. Please don\u00b4t get annoyed by people trying to sell you their stuff even if they follow you for a couple of meters (or blocks) - souk is the place to go shopping and this is the part of the Moroccan culture that you came to discover, so it\u00b4s unfair to complain about it. If you are not interested, just tell them, firmly, but politely, that you don\u00b4t need any of it. And the most important thing - enjoy the experience!"

EVERYONE SPEAKS ENGLISH SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY!TAKE LOCAL CASHBARGIN FOR EVERYTHING, MAKE DEALS IF YOU'RE BUYING MORE THAN ONEIt can be a little overwhelming at first because all the vendors are talking to you trying to get you to go into their shops and sell you their goods. You just have to be firm with them and only go into the shop if you really might want to buy something from it. They will keep you in there showing you everything they have. Its huge and you want to see as much as you can so say no thank you and keep walking."

Where do you start with something so diverse?The fresh juices, dresses, crockery, ornaments, artwork, lanterns, shoes, food, sculpted ceramics and handcrafted metallic kitchenware, spices being hand-ground right in front of you, other detailed glass and wooden articles for a home, cushions, fabrics, fruits. If I had the room in my bags, I would have bought a whole tea set with matching multicoloured glasses and a metal tray, along with lanterns to place outside on the veranda, cushions and a big, main features hanging lantern for outdoor summer parties and BBQs. The only thing for me which really lets it down is that animals are not treated well there. I saw one kind man feeding starving, wild cats chicken legs, but there were countless others on top of that, and at least they were free. When you see de-fanged snakes being tamed by snake-charmers and monkeys pulling on their chains tying them to their owners who force them to flip and do tricks throughout the day, horses and donkeys walking on hot, dry concrete barely ever getting water and looking parched and tired, forced to pull a carriage purely for the enjoyment of the tourists, it's really depressing. It's an animal-lover's worst nightmare.Don't go for the animal welfare, but go for everything else. The culture and history and the completely different way of life."

In Marrakech, on the other hand, you spend most of the time stressed out, trying to avoid motorcycles, cyclists, cars etc.. (I was hit by a cyclist, but no injuries). Peddlers are a little more aggressive. I'm glad we did Fes first, and if you are pressed for time in Morocco, I would skip Marrakech altogether."

The medina and souk of Marrakech is one of the most lively I visited in Morocco but this positive aspect is mirrored by threats of mugging, pickpocketing or just being ripped off. As always in Morocco, the price you are offered for goods in the Souk is much beyond what they are worth, always haggle. I was cautious of my valuables and never had a thing taken out my pockets but I suspect it does happen. One night myself and three friends (all males) walked deep into the Souk to find somewhere to eat that might be cheaper and less touristy than the main square. As we walked further the streets became quieter and there were less and less stalls. A man started to lead us back towards the main square but suspecting he'd want money from us we insisted that we'd walk alone. He did not listen. It's worth noting, this was not just because of a language barrier since a member of our group speaks Arabic. After a while the first man left us and another man took his place, the two of them swapping roles as we walked. The second man insisted we pay the first although we had constantly said we would not do so, to both men. The second man became aggressive and threatened each of us with 'a problem' gesturing to his shorts as if he had a knife. Eventually we made it back to the familiar area of the souk unharmed, only shaken. Do not let this put you off visiting the Medina, only take this as a cautionary tale. Don't wander late at night without knowing where you are going. Do not let people follow you."

What can I say, agree with lots of reviewers here it's a place must be seen but not a place for those who don't like being lost or feel overwhelmed walking in a crowded gigantic market. This souq is an Amazing place to buy traditional clothes, spices, oils and hand crafted goods, but over priced for what they should be. For me a souq is a place where you can get goods with bargains that are cheaper than any where else, but in this case everything was over priced and you think you are bargaining but really you'll end up paying the same amount as you would in any other market. Night time it turns out to be more colourful, as they set up numerous of food stalls, magic shows and some traditional acts. Be very careful with pick pockets and don't ask for dropping the price if you are not serious to buy. They won't like it and some shopkeepers can become very rude. Best time to go for shopping is early morning when there are less people, then the shopkeepers will listen to you! If you can't eat street food then don't worry there are plenty of good cafeterias and restaurants near by, you can dine in with a good price, in a cleaner and a calmer place."

This time was with a 10 and 11 year old.My memory of the 1st trip was getting hassle constantly, night and day in every area. Stop to look at a map, sight, stool or anything and 2-3 people are on you, very forcefully trying to sell you something or get you into their shop. It really spoiled our enjoyment as you feel you have to constantly keep moving and can't relax. There is also the constant threat of having your wallet or purse lifted.This time around, with children was worse. We only spent an hour there as the hawkers now target you and your kids (two girls in my case ( which are soft targets and got quite scared at some points and they do not back off!We would not go back.It's a real shame, the place is magical but spoiled by the constant hassle. I appreciate it's a different culture but in such a poor country, a place with this many tourists becomes a massive target, to its detriment.

There is so much to look at and miles of Souks to explore.Things to beware of: the men walking round with snakes ready to drape them on your shoulders. I hate snakes, I'm petrified of them so this was a real fear for me, but if anyone approaches you just tell them very firmly to stay away from you and move off quickly. You do have to be on your guard and it did mean that I never felt particularly relaxed when walking round the Medina. Other things to beware of: the orange juice gave me a VERY upset stomach on my last day. They don't wash the glasses properly. On the whole, this is an unmissable experience. You basically have to go through the Medina if you're walking round Marrakech. It's the heart of the city and it really comes alive at night. We found a nice bar overlooking the Jemaa-El-Fnaa where we could enjoy the atmosphere with a refreshing drink. I would also recommend going shopping in the Souks in the evening - its thriving, and a lot of fun.Don't take any valuables. Don't take too much money out with you and just be aware of everything around you. But on the whole, it's incredible. Buy lots of spices and beautiful rugs and interesting teapots!"

I didn't know if it felt like I was at a festival or a riot!From snake charmers, men with monkeys, henna artists and beggars - it has it all. At night it truly comes alive with the street food stalls out also.Once you get used to being asked to \"look around my shop\" for the thousand time, it's really ok. However I did feel really safe and was never intimidated by any of the shop owners.We much preferred going deeper into the Souks, down the narrow roads where the shop owners were less in your face. You are expected to haggle and they take it as an insult if you don't.We were helped out several times by men (when we appeared lost) to be shown the way, which we thought would be a money making scheme but more often than not it was just to show us where their uncle/cousin/brother had their shop!This is definitely a must see - just for the culture shock!!"

Yes people are trying to garner your business and drag you into see there goods, but a polite no thank you WITH A SMILE, was enough to stop them. Getting out of the souk was a nightmare, which turned very scary. We had asked some people for directions and they pointed us in a direction, which seemed to be going down smaller and smaller alleys, not going out into the wider main area. we stopped again to ask a couple of ladies who were buying food at a stand, and they looked alarmed and told us we had been sent in completely the wrong direction, and not to follow anyone and only ask women for directions. A couple of moments later one of the men we had asked directions of appeared and started shouting at the lady, her response was not good.We followed her advice, and only asked women for directions, and about 25 mins later we made it out into the main square.We did return to the souk, in daylight and it was a far better experience."

I would recommend visiting in the evening if you don't have young or elderly people in your group.Haggle and stick to what you say, they really don't like it when you change your mind.

            "review": "A great experience. Mostly very wonderful moments but a few just plain horrible!. I have to say this; overall its was a lovely and interesting place. BUT... there was some very strange things that threw us out of our comfort zones. Although this is not necessarily a bad thing as its good to be shook up a bit, it got a bit annoying and too persistent to be enjoyable. What I mean by that is when we went to the Souks (which are the hundreds of year old twisty, turney shopping streets that look like they\u2019ve come out of an Indiana Jones movie!), but Im getting ahead of myself here.We had a few trips out to Marrakesh day and night and especially the old town where the souks are (as mentioned previously). Well to say that\u2019s an experience is an understatement. What you have to understand is that this is a very old city that fuels itself with bartering and trying to get the best deals out of whoever wants to buy their stuff. You have to know how to deal with it and try to enjoy it. But that\u2019s not the first issue I had with the place. As soon as I put my foot to the pavement from the coach, the touts all come flocking towards you to offer you exclusive trips around the souks and the places of interest. They spout on that they are the \u201cofficial\u201d tour guides of the place you are staying at... but they are most definitely not... all lies and they will not leave you alone. In the guide books they say that a simple clear \u201cno thank you\u201d will deter them and they will say thank you and turn away. Rubbish! I couldn\u2019t get rid of this guy when all I tried to say is we wanted to do this on our own and had a limited time there (which we did of 3 hours). It eventually got through to him that he was now truly annoying me. I told him so and said in not quite friendly terms if he didn\u2019t go away it may get very unpleaent as you are not listening to me and now your harassing me. This is all within 10 minutes of getting off the coach. Doesn\u2019t put you in the best of moods to then go off a try and get yourself a good deal in the souks. And to top all that as we walked on another one came up, said to me \u201che was annoying wasn\u2019t he?\u201d and then started with the same guff as the last on!!!! Anyway once we got rid off these idiots we made our way into Jemaa el-Fnaa - which is the main square that lead to the souks. Absolutely chaotic but fantastic. Its used as a mad kind of intersection for traffic in the day but at nights gets closed off and they have a massive food market, street vendors selling all sorts of food and street entertainers. Anyway the souks are incredible, claustrophobic, and fascinating. Ive never experienced anything like it. It really is like a film set and the streets are narrow, covered above by wood panels and corrugated metal stretched across the buildings to offer a bit of shade from the relentless hot sun. This all gives it a mystical atmosphere and a twilight feel. They sell everything here, spices, leather goods, shoes, hats are the specialities but lots of knock off stuff and fakes that you cant tell the difference from the real ones.You have to barter and haggle for everything, even if you want to buy a can of coke! Its just how it is and they love to do it. I wanted a leather old school satchel and had a shop around, eventually after again lots of \u201ccome here sir and see my wears\u201d we found a great shop that had just what I wanted. The prices start ridiculously high and you have to make a judgement and offer a 1/5 of that price. For example the one I wanted was 1200 dirham which is the equivalent of \u00a394. So I offered \u00a318. They look at you as if your mad (but this is all done very good natured) and then they take about \u00a320 off. I say nope that nowhere near what I want to pay. They ask again what I want to pay and I say the most Ill go up to is \u00a325. Again its \u201cmy friend I cant sell it for that, how about \u00a350?\u201d. And back and forth it goes until I decided to say well thanks but I\u2019ll look somewhere else and they gently put a hand on your shoulder and say \u201chow about \u00a330?\u201d. Which is exactly what I wanted to pay anyway and no higher. We shake hands and its a done deal. Lots of fun that and that\u2019s why people really like it.But saying this it was then kind of spoilt as they tried to offload a very fake looking \u00a350 note saying that they couldn't exchange it and could we buy it off them? Not very fair that and not selling me this \"amazing experience\" you read so much about from other reviewers.So, after a while you do get lost and have to use the Mosque Tower as a ref point to get back to where you started. Problem is you can\u2019t always see it due to the coverings above and how unbelievably narrow the streets become. You have to walk sideways as there is produce on either side and they really do pester you (but in a friendly way). Another things to look out for is people offering you a way out, only to find out they are leading you to a shop they own, or a friends, a sisters etc... That\u2019s annoying and we nearly fell fowl of that one, you just end up saying \u201cno thank you, I think your taking me somewhere I don\u2019t want to go\u201d. Trying to take pictures is hard in there too as someone, somewhere will say that you need to give money to take them. Basically you have to pay for everything in there! All in all very, very interesting but like I said it does throw you well and truly out of your comfort zone. My youngest son loved it as he bought a fez; he\u2019s always wanted a proper one and had a great time with the very friendly guy who sold it to him. My eldest enjoyed it to a point, but was fed up with the constant mithering. My partner said the same but even more so, she just didn\u2019t like it at all. Too closed in for her and personal space invaded. Totally got where she was coming from but you have to try and rise above it.Finally \u201cescaping\u201d the ancient consumer jungle we headed for a cafe and had a lovely fresh orange juice. And got a chance to relax and talk over what we had seen and then it was time for the coach back. Now the night time experience is totally different and truly amazing... we all enjoyed that. The square transforms into something completely different. Yes again there is mithering but in a different way, this time they want you in their pop-up caf\u00e9\u2019s. So we got into one and the food was beautiful, all sorts of dipping sauces for your kebabs, soups with lots of spices and the most tasty bread Ive ever eaten. The owners are friendly and offer free fizzy drinks so not too bad, and incredibly cheap (about \u00a318 for all 4 of us, including starters, mains, soups, drinks). So with our bellies full, we fancied one of the much talked about freshly squeezed orange juice stalls that everyone talks about there. And for good reason... best juice I think I\u2019ve ever had. The oranges there are huge and bright in colour, and the juice they get out of them is ridiculous, like a running tap!!! All done in front of you and then chilled very quickly in this blast chiller they all seem to have. Again my youngest fell in love with it and had quite a few. So cheap too, about 25p for the equivalent of a pint glass. After this we went to one of the sky cafe\u2019s (which are basically caf\u00e9\u2019s on top of the roofs surrounding the square), very stylish and friendly again, but with a lot of the more well-to-do locals having milkshakes and coffee\u2019s. From here you can see all the square and well into Marrakesh itself, lots of bright lights and entertainment. This was worth it just for the view. Very beautiful. Walking back to the coach we looked at snake charmers, transvestite dancers (apparently a local custom for men to dress as women and entertain) magicians (really good) and storytellers. Those we couldn\u2019t understand but didn\u2019t really need to as they looked amazing and were all very much into the visual side of storytelling. All in all very enjoyable and I would love to do that again."

One thing to remember is not to make eye contact or speak with the locals in the markets otherwise they don't leave you alone.

Do not panic, just walk out and follow the medina walls in the direction of where you started. Moreover if you ask for Djema el Fna most people will tell you where to go. Only some youngsters give wrong information on purpose. Ask elderly shopkeepers. East of the medina is where the poor people live. On the West side there is the new city with a shopping mall and residential areas where the wealthy live. If you like shopping the medina with its souks will feel like paradise, though the bargaining process may me cumbersome. The Kasbah area on the South side of the medina is more spacious and relaxed. This is where the royal palace and some sights are. Personally I liked the gardens which are just outside the medina and more quiet."

There's always another stall selling the same thing around the corner, so if you don't get something for the best price, walk away and find it elsewhere."

There just was not enough time to explore and enjoy all the fantastic street food. I fell in love with the idea when I found myself watching Jamie Oliver in Morocco and a special part of that was the night market and it's food on offer. During the day. There is nothing happening and the square is mostly deserted. Come sunset.... a whole new, yet old world reveals itself. . The food stalls come alive. There is so much on offer that you have a hard time choosing. We picked No.22, there was nothing particularly different about this one other than they had a rather novel way of getting your attention. Once seated they were exceptionally friendly and dare I say efficient. Given everything is cooked from fresh on rather primitive grills. They are rather quick knocking the food out.We ordered our soft drinks. No booze served at the stalls. Straight away we got warm bread brought to us. Then the charming fellow took our order. We had a bit of everything.Mixed Kebabs, Fried Prawns, Grilled Lamb Chops, Vegetable Tagine. Followed this up with fresh Baklava style pastries from a passing seller and Berber Whiskey (minted green tea).The whole lot was 360 Moroccan Dirahms. Approx \u00a325 This is one of those places where you don't need to look at things too closely. In today's world of fastidious health and hygiene. One look at thier practises would send an EHO into an apoplectic fit. That said. Everything was served at a good core tempreture and none of us got ill,and we ate there twice as it was that good.Couple of pointers that will make your visit even more enjoyable. 1. If you fancy a glass of wine with your dinner? Take it with you in a coloured soft drinks bottle. They won't mind.2. Hand wipes or wet wipes. Take some with you and no greasy hands after.3. Dress comfortable. . It can be very warm and lots of people. Leave fashion for another day.4. Keep your mind open. They have been cooking and eating this way since before the bible was written.All in all. A superb street meal and an amazing experience. ."

No matter what you think you need or want to buy, loose yourself in the souks and indulge in local tradition of haggling. Even if you don't buy, you'll spend many happy hours having fun on doing this. You can strike many good deals on products (such as leather ones) that would cost 10 times the price in Occident. Very rarely shop keepers get upset but it ca happen. One has sworn at my daughter, another one was rude and lost our business (he ran after us for 200 yards trying to apologise but my wallet was by then fully sealed). The medina is amazing, every nook and cranny occupied by a shop of some sort. In the high heat of the afternoon many of them give up and decide to lie in a corner of the shop or on top of their merchandise and have an extensive nap. Walking in the medina also enables you to meet many locals and some are happy to have great conversations even if they know they won't have your business. However, do not underestimate the means employed to lure you into a transaction. You might be invited in the special almost ceremonious room at the back where a Touareg-looking guy will serve you tea and invite you to seat as a choice guest. You are no longer a man off the street but a highly respected and noble person. Before you a table, on this table products shown to you with expertise, in a secret ceremony-like atmosphere. Hard to say no. I did but enjoyed various ways these guys have developed to access your treasury and make you let go of some of your money. Be aware, but play the game of the medina which is an amazing experience, the best thing you will be doing in Marrakesh. Immerse yourself and enjoy."

We were astonished how clean it was, all things considered, and the narrowness of the streets shaded the worst of the heat. It was astonishing, exciting , just great. Some advice.1. Get your hotel or other advisor to explain how to navigate around, and especially to find your way home. then go for it. We walked everywhere, never had a problem.2. Be confident in saying no thankyou, worked for us, very few persisted beyong the first request.3. Beware of stopping and consulting your map too publicly, you could get surrounded by unwanted advisors. We probably turned away a few folk who genuinely just wanted to help, but that's the price you pay.3. Keep handfuls of (very) small change, casual tipping of acrobats, beggars, guys whose donkey you photograph...4. Be careful crossing the roads!5. There genuinely appears to be no crime, and if you do want to engage in the haggling process, remember its just a game.6. We never had any hassle in restaurants over prices or service. 7.

Most of the restaurants look out over the square and you can sit for hours just watching the people who make up the intricate yet vibrant tapestry of the square. The souks are excellent with a great variety of goods on sale. You must have one of the freshly squeezed juices available from ridiculously early in the morning and very reasonably priced too. The fruit and spices on sale in the souks bombard your senses not to mention the sheer height of the spice mounds.

I would suggest walking around the outsides of the market so where the fresh orange juice is made (try this, its delicious!!). We went during the day and weren't bugged too much by being asked to come in the shop or buy anything which was good. We did buy some little things like flip flops. However, on our way out of the market we started to walk through the middle where a lady tried to force henna on my arm and a man tried to force a monkey onto my boyfriend's shoulder for money. So during the day, I would suggest not walking through the centre of the market! Also ladies, I would suggest covering up as much as possible, I was wearing a maxi skirt and long sleeved top and still got stared at etc. I think due to my fair hair so maybe wear a hat. I also noticed some locals taking pictures of female English tourists that were wearing shorts and a top, so be considerate and respectable around the outsides of the resorts. Other then that, I really enjoyed the experience and would recommend it as an eye-opening one!"

The market sellers mostly sell the same produce and items. The sellers are very pushy and at times drag you by the arm from the crowds to pull you into their stalls. If you have young children it is very difficult to keep hold of them to keep them close especially when they are so distracted by the hustle and bustle. It is a labyrinth of stalls and it is very easy to get lost which can be quite daunting. The food items for sale are usually covered in millions of flies which is quite revolting. At the top end of the square there are shops and stalls with fixed prices which makes shopping less stressful and more enjoyable as you don't find yourself in an awkward position of haggling with demanding, pushy and at times quite aggressive stall owners. You will find many Muslim women will approach you, take your hand and start drawing on your skin with henna no matter how many times you say no and try to pull away and then will cause a scene shouting and chasing you for money claiming that you agreed to it.

Having heard about the souks and markets here we spent a day roaming the city around the stalls and little alleys that are Marrakech Medina. Everything is in walking distance within the walls. I'd read about the hassle of walking through the markets but we had not one problem. There are hundreds of stalls and they all want you to buy in their shop but maintain your confidence and walk through at your own pace, be friendly but don't look interested if your not! The locals are friendly but wild! Watch out for scooters and bikes flying down the tiny alleys. You will be beeped at but even the locals are beeped at. You will find the younger men may make remarks at western females regarding the way we dress but don't even bat an eye lid and they will leave you alone. It's totally safe. We carried cameras and phones and cash and had not a problem! Don't give in to anyone trying to give you directions as they will ask for money. Simply \"NO\" and walk away, be stern and say thanks! You would spend days looking at the medina and all the attractions in it! Pack plenty of sunscreen and comfortable shoes. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a culture shock!"

The Medina is not only the ancient part of the city, but also one of the biggest street markets in Morocco.It's small streets hide multiple stores in which you can buy any kind of artisan crafts, Berber antiques and general Moroccan souvenirs. It is better to go with a guide, since he will tell you which stores sell quality items and which sell Chinese copies and low quality items.It is also recommendable to be aware of everything you have and everyone in your group, since it is easy to get lost.If you are looking to buy something be prepared to haggle because the prices are way to high for the real value of items and they are prepared to lower it even to a third (or more, depending on your skills) of the original price.Have fun in the medina, it is surely a place to visit."

There are a wide variety of goods for sale and some very interesting shows in the main square, snake charming being one of them.If you want to do some shopping, which I highly recommend, be sure to haggle. At most of the stalls you can generally get items for as low as twenty percent of the asking price, and do not be afraid to walk away, this is a useful haggling tactic, and the chances are that another stand will have the exact same item. Just be patient and keep a good head on your shoulders, and you will save a lot of money.The area is fairly safe, but being a heavily crowded area, be careful of your valuables.Marrakech is definitely somewhere you should visit if you are traveling to Morocco. Also, they have some really cool tours available like the Ouzoud Falls, don't forget good walking shoes for that one!"

Keep your wits about you at all times and leave your valuables at your accommodation. He didn't get anything except a sore hand!Beware anyone giving you free information on what's going on, I got tricked by a \"student studying English\" giving me interesting info on what I was watching in the main square. Before I knew it I was sitting at a fortune teller with the student translating and then they wanted \u20ac20.Needless to say they didn't get it but I did give them around \u20ac3 and I left with a lesson as I should have seen it coming earlier!There are motor cycles everywhere and within the Medina it's a free for all with everyone and no-one having right of way. Walk on the right, look behind you before changing direction and keep a firm hold of kids hands.I'd avoid taking kids under 10 to Marrakech and be prepared to have your heart in your mouth every time a moped comes at them.With these warnings said, it is a wonderful place to see and take in the sights, sounds, tastes and smells. Snake charmers, musicians, dancers, spice stalls, orange juice sellers, crafts men, pastries from street sellers for 1 Dirham ( around \u20ac0.10) and exploring the narrow streets with something new round every corner.Spring time has been recommended to us for a return visit, the heat in July is a little intense.Top tip from me is to spend no longer than two nights in Marrakech. Head to Essaouira, on the coast. The Medina there is quieter, friendlier, cooler and much safer to give kids or indeed novice travellers a taste of Morocco without the risks of Marrakech."

It's a joy to discover the singular urbanism of ancient islamic civilisation, its architectural aspects and also the change that happened to it.

I was there with my husband and we were lead different paths after getting lost, by people claiming not to be guides. there are so many small roads and alleyways around this place it is easy to lose your bearings. We were eventually brought to a leather making production area (which we did not ask to go to) the smell was horrific, they gave us sage to put under our nose and then gave us a tour of the place (we really had no choice at this stage) before being brought to the shop bearing the finished produce. before we knew it we were sitting drinking mint tea (which is delicious I have to say)The main guy told us if we didn't buy anything at the end we would all still be friends. he had his assistant start throwing out the rugs for us to view explaining they could be delivered by DHL, by the end of it he got annoyed because I don't haggle and I don't pay \u20ac500 for a rug, we eventually got out after I calmly told him that getting irritated would not cause me to buy something. When we were outside the premises the guy who brought us there told us he wanted paying, I refused and told him I hadn't asked him to bring me here, 3 more men approached shouting at me to pay the man, I ended up using a few choice words I didn't really want to use but..... I couldn't wait to get out of there and due to this we didn't see any more of it, we kept our heads down and got out as quick as possible which was a shame because I would have liked to have had a proper look around without the hassle. Keep in mind if you do visit, keep to the right or else you will be knocked down by one of the many scooters/bikes. Although it is their culture to hound etc, I would feel more comfortable buying things without constantly being tormented, if they left me alone I would most certainly browse their stall. Needless to say we will not be returning anytime soon. I wouldn't recommend women to visit this place alone, actually I wouldn't recommend anyone to visit this place alone."

I have visited five time over the past few years (both with family and as a couple) and always go back to the Medina - but I don't necessarily stay there (areas slightly outside in the Palmerie or Hivernage are quieter). It is made up of shops, mosques, cafes, restaurants, hotels (roads), and much much more. This might sound too obvious to state, but get a map of the souks and study it a bit before you go. Also, if you are definitely going shopping, decide what you might want and concentrate on those areas - and most importantly, allow yourself time. It really can be an enjoyable experience just chatting to stallholders - you don't HAVE to buy! They can be aggressive in trying for a sale, in which case just walk away. Especially in the hot months, it is good to just wander with breaks at one of the many cafes. Also it is a more comfortable experience if you dress conservatively with covered arms and legs - this is city, not a beach. I have also seen many 'groups' being marched quickly around the area, many looking frightened. Yes, it is very different, but I've never found it dangerous - just watch out for the motorbikes and donkey carts."

It was Ramadan when we visited so the market was not open till 6pm onwards. On the way to market we walked through the cobblestone alleyway and some local shops. The motorbike riders were atrocious. I thought was going to be hit by one or few of them. They were the bad drivers I had ever seen. The market itself was massive. They sold loads of local stuffs but very pricey so you have to negotiate to get the item that you need for a cheap price. You could always shop around as shops sold same items but that was if you would be able to get out of the shop as they would try to keep you in until you gave up and buy off an item. Yes they were very pushy to the point that you would feel very uncomfortable and annoyed. I was expecting to see stalls of spices in the market but was disappointed not to seen one. There were loads of food stalls where you could eat local foods like tagines, pastilles, and skewers and you wont be able to miss them as they would chase you until you sat down to have a meal in their stall. Especially if you would be going in a massive group like us they would never stop asking repetitively and annoyingly. Foods were okey and rather cheap compare to a proper restaurant but the amount of torture you got from them before even having a meal was horrifying. Please note that the round chewy bread was not for free. Everything that would be served on the table had it's price so be mindful of what you eat and order. It was nice to visit just once but definitely not recommend this if you would be travelling on your own. Safety first. "

However, we found some of the people in the medina particularly aggressive and not respectful - intentionally trying to lead tourists down the wrong paths and then demanding payment and henna women grabbing arms and drawing on them without permission and then demanding payment. There is no problem in making a living but it doesn't have to be done this way. When politely declining or sometimes having to ignore repeated requests, some people started to get angry and used racial slurs at us which never has a place. Really too bad given I love markets and the experience of bargaining and soaking in the sights and sounds, and was very much looking forward to this.

It is a building with several shops inside that mostly offer the same goods you can find in the souks but for fixed prices. In a super relaxed atmosphere with helpful but not pushy sellers you will find everything you need. Prices there are usually lower than for what you will get it in the souks (even with hours of haggling and charming the seller)."

We visited the medina in both daytime and night time and both were incredible within their own right. Day time - Haggling in the souks, seeing the people at work and exploring the beautiful city. Prepare to get lost, as no matter how good your map is - you're never going to locate yourself in this maze. The roads are crazy, from mopeds, donkeys, cows, cars, taxi, - you never know what is coming next. I actually had someone drive into me on their moped in the souks - so please be careful. We really enjoyed haggling in the souks, always go at least 50% of what they are asking - you can get some great bargains - and we almost needed to add extra kg on our luggage allowance. Night time - We ate in a caf\u00e9 overlooking the square at night which was incredible. There was live music, performing acts and thousands of people. It was such a fascinating experience and definitely something not to be missed. We had been advised to not go into the medina travelling as two young girls (aged 21 and 22) but we were fine. We never felt unsafe and the people of Marrakech are lovely, friendly and welcoming. Of course, you get the normal comments - just as you would in England...but do not let this put you off. It is an incredible experience, not one to be missed!"

The Medina is in the old town in Marrakesh, and the guide books will tell you all about the sights, hotels and restaurants. It would be missing out to Marrakesh and not have a good wander around the Medina and experience this atmospheric and at times enchanting city. The practical side is enjoy it, immerse yourself in the culture and what makes it a fantastic experience, but keep your wits about you.We visited the Medina in the evenings to go to a couple of restaurants. We visited Djemaa el-Fna square and nearly got ripped off by a particularly aggressive snake charmer. We wandered the area by the souks. We visited a couple of restaurants, and the Place des Espices (Rahba Kedima). We were not so interested in shopping in the souks, but that\u2019s another experience worth visiting the Medina for.And as they say, when in Marrakesh... so we got completely lost while we were there. Not just a little bit off track, but lost as not having a clue where we were. It's hard to navigate even with a map as the roads are windy and street names are hard to find at times. Or the ones you do find are not on the map! But you can't wander too far in terms of distance so seeking help from a restaurant or shop worker will set you back on track.Visiting the Medina and all that comes with it is part of visiting Marrakesh, and despite it being tricky to navigate at times, I wouldn't say avoid it. In fact, quite the opposite. But in our experience there are a few things to be aware of. First of all, getting lost is probably inevitable so allow for that when traveling to and from restaurants. Getting lost is so part of the experience for tourists that a minority of shifty locals have scams in place to exploit it. But if you keep your wits about you, are aware of it you can probably avoid falling trap to the scams. Best advice, from our experience, keep your cool, and ignore them because it can feel quite stressful and at times intimidating.Things that were tried with us (that we didn't fall for). Local people shouting \"that way is closed\" \"the square is closed for prayer\" \"you can't go that way\", and being quite insistent, almost sounding convincing and following us, repeating their \u201cwarnings.\u201d The trick behind that one is so you follow them, and end up somewhere you didn't intend to go (such as a shop where you feel compelled to buy something or a restaurant you weren't going to). Apparently it's common to get people to the tanneries. Also a few sinister looking characters followed us, and tried to get us to go with them for directions. So tempting when you are lost, but my advice is do what we did, and go to a reputable shop or restaurant where the staff will be only too happy to help. Also local children swarmed on us a couple of times, again to give directions we hadn't asked for.The guide books also tell you to take care about pickpockets, but that's common sense in any large city. The guide books also say the crime rate in Marrakesh is relatively low, so it\u2019s important to keep perspective on this.Stall holders in the souks and outdoor stalls can be quite pushy and actually put us off browsing, which were potential sales lost. The intrusion with potential scammers and over zealous vendors was quite off-putting.I must also add that the majority of people you will come across will be decent and welcoming, and local people going about their daily business. There are also some great restaurants and riads to be found among the winding streets."

One of our party literally called it a 'revelation', and said he'd never realised just how bad what we drink at home really was! I don't know how you pick which vendors include ice (for those worried about getting sick), but I had plenty from different vendors and had no problems.For the night, walk around the food stalls until you find someone who can convince you to eat at theirs over others. We were won over by a man who had realised we were Australian, and thus started swearing so we'd feel more at home! Classic stuff."

Marrakech's medina isn't the biggest (Fes is simply amazing), nor particularly authentic (try Sale for a real-world example of life as it was still existing in the new century). My best characterization of the Marrakech medina/souks is the Moroccan dollar store. If you need a cheap little tagine, ok, but if you want hand-crafted goods skip it. Not to say they don't make product there - you can get off the main drag and find everything you could wish for. But my experience is that, unlike the rest of Morocco, Marrakech is tired of tourists even as they feed upon them. As we walked through the medina, at every turn they told us which way the square was. In a pushy way without being asked. \"Get back in your box\" was the message I heard. We were headed to some of the museums of the city and by the time we got there it wasn't worth it at all (with the exception of the photo museum which was a nice oasis). If you do go, seek out the Berber-esque sections - they are devoid of motor travel and it's quite pleasant to talk with the shop keepers.Speaking of mopeds, Marrakech is also unique in the number of mopeds in the medina and the speed at which they travel. I coined the term 'guide stride' after the second guide we hired for a history lesson showed up with a limp from being essentially run down. Word to the wise, do not attempt to take quick pictures of anything from the dates in the stalls to people without asking. It's unwelcome in the Muslim culture generally but people react violently here. If you see something you want to photograph, buy something.The square morphs throughout the day but I'll just say that, while I'm glad to have seen it, it would not be something I would recommend to anyone for a destination. The crowds are fun to see but the real entertainment are the story tellers that enthrall hundreds as they act out scenes from the past in wonderful detail. In Arabic. So as a westerner, you're relegated to being harassed by the snake charmers that show up and drape some specie on your shoulder to try to lure you in for $20 worth of pictures. You can get fresh escargo here if you're into that. It's like Bourbon street without the party atmosphere. Lots of OJ stalls so it's got that."

Many focus on the souks, but there are many interesting historic sites within the Medina such as the Stork Hospital, Medersa Ben Youssef, Saadian Tombs, and Bahia Palace. These sites offer dazzling displays of tiles, painted ceilings, ornate carved woodwork, and intricate plaster designs. We enjoyed wandering the endless lanes and labyrinth of the souks. Have fun with it! If you haven't shopped for items to take home, this is the place to do it. In fact, I recommend getting ceramics in Fes and waiting to get everything else in Marrakech. Rule of thumb, whatever is the first price, counter at 1/3 and have fun bargaining from there. You will never get lost, so just go with the flow of people. Once you have purchased from a vendor, ask them for directions to the Jemaa el Fna to re-orient yourself and enjoy!"

The salesmen are unrelentingly aggressive and deceitful, especially in the pop-up restaurants at night. They will quote one price, then demand a higher figure at the end. The entire djemma is a facade of the real Morocco. Having spent the last month traveling the entire country I can definitively say that Marrakech was the worst place I visited; and I was there for a week. Other travelers met along the way agree.

Our 4th visit to Marrakesh over 10 years, and as ever, the Medina, old city of Marrakesh, is the star of this fabulous city.Smells, sounds and sights compete for our attention, combining in a heady mix of ancient culture in a modern world.The twisting alleys can be daunting for the 1st-timer, but after a day or so, you get used to them and revel in \"navigating\" with maps and help from the locals. Getting lost is all part of the fun!We feel safer in Marrakesh than we do in most UK cities: the people of Marrakesh are the city's heartbeat...and it has a heart of gold.Every traveller should pack a large sense of humour: join in the banter, watch the food stalls in the Jemaa el Fna square joyfully cajole tourists and locals alike into eating at their traditional, bench-seated diner, and if things take a little longer than you're used to at home - smile - you're in Marrakesh! In the main square, we especially love dinner at \"Simon's food stall 81, The European-style Argana coffee house, (fab pastries!), and the terrific restaurant Chez Chegrouni, where you write down what you order on a piece of paper, and give it to the waiter. Great Moroccan food here + good value too.The maze of alleys, wider lanes and roads are a constant source of fascination...take time to walk, rather than use taxis everywhere.The Medina also encompasses innumerable shops, cafes, restaurants, market stalls, a few palaces, (not on the scale of Buckingham Palace, but well worth an or two of your time, and incredibly cheap to visit), and of course the main souk, just off Jemaa el Fna square, itself, a World Heritage site.Go, go, go!"

They start of pretending to help by telling this is your bus stop and timetable to return. There were also teenage boys waiting at the bus stop forcing you to buy sweets of them even after you say no they don't go away. Once you are walking in the new medina the malls are fixed prices so it's not so bad. However, whilst walking around you get attended my locals trying to sell things and ladies pretending to be poor begging for money. The old medina is awful as you get harassed by several men who stop you when your looking at your phone map and general map. Even if you politely say no you don't need their help they still ask where you going and try to give the wrong direction to what's on the map and don't leave you alone. The worst is the fake tour guides in the old medina. We got approached by one called moustafa who apparently claimed his service is free because he works for the government and guided us to go to the markets but it turned out to be his family/friends shops with fake government flags. They started off going on about their culture about specialising in carpets and argan oil then trying force us to buy carpets for ridiculous prices. when we had and showed no interest they were becoming verbally aggressive and annoyed. Avoid any fake tourist who pretend to work for the government and say they will take you to the government markets/shops. In fact avoid them altogether and stick with guidance from your hotel/holiday package tour representatives and the map. The old medina in Marrakech is another version of Egypt where you get harassed by dodgy cunning people."

The food is amazing, and prices are pretty cheap. That being said, here is a few things you need to watch out for; as I said previously that the people are very nice...so nice they will nice the money right out of your pocket. If you want to buy something it's ok to ask the price, but realize you can barter for about half (or less) than the price they give you. If you aren't interested, thank them and keep moving. Another thing is they will ask you for your \"lowest offer\", if you give them a offer..you just opened negotiations..realize though it's still ok to walk away, just a little harder. The best and cheapest way to buy beer or liquor is at the store in \"new city\". It will cost about 20 Durham and 5 minutes by taxi. If you just want an occasional beer or drink, go to hotel Tazi, they have a bar and are relatively cheap, but not store cheap. Do not hire a horse cart to take you around the medina, most of the horses are actually taken care of, the rest are not and it's sad. While we were there my wife and I saw a horse collapse out of sheer exhaustion and the driver started kicking the horse in the head to make it get up. Alot of people, including myself yelled at him to stop, and he did. But still. The food is amazing as well. The fruit vendors will mix fresh squeezed orange juice and any other fruit you can think of for 10 Durham. Very cheap, good, and healthy. Chicken Tajine is very popular and amazing. One last thing, if someone asks ti take you to the leather tannery, its not worth it, stinky, and not in a great part of town..trust me when i say to skip this..you arent missing anything . Above all, have fun and keep moving."

The Jemma al Fna is always interesting with snake charmers, fortune tellers, letter writers, etc. Of course it is full of mostly tourists, but definitely a place not to be missed in the city. We spent a day walking around and loved the energy of the place, loved the small shops, loved walking around the artisan stalls where people we actually making metal objects, rugs, wood pieces, etc. That was fascinating to watch! But over the last few years it has become ever more difficult to walk around safely because of the increasing number of motor scooters that roar through the small streets. Many of them are driven by testerone-fueled young men who seem not to realize actual human beings are using the same paths. In addition to the danger, the smell of the gas/oil is unpleasant. Add the scooters to the usual bicycles, mules, carrying carts and it is sometimes harrowing to get where you want to go. Don't know why the city doesn't ban the scooters but until they do, the medina (especially the souks with its narrower streets) is not a place we like to stroll around."

He even misled us to our destination. There's loads of animal cruelty going on: snakes, cobras and monkeys. Fake silver being sold in the Berber house tour which they even weight pretending it's a silver but later on we found out it's just fake. As well, fake silver being sold on the streets.

There's no peace at all eating.....vendor offer loads of stuff for us to buy every minute non-stop, expensive tourist price in the restaurant, food have no taste at all! I've been harassed as well while walking, some Moroccan men making sex remarks even my husband was beside me as well, when we went inside the shops. Some of them keep touching my shoulders while talking to buy stuffs. Bargaining experience was horrible! I hate it, they know how to cheat people. Every Moroccan wants a piece of tourist money. And there was a morrocan woman who just grab my hand and painted henna unsolicited and charging 200 dirhams then won't go away until we agreed to pay her 50 dirhams for her to go away. Kids, old people and mother carrying child begging for money. Leather bags-buy from the shop with a price tag. We later found out after bargaining hard that the same bags we bought were more cheaper in the other shop (only 1shop) have a price tag around that medina and it's hard to find and he will not even forced us to buy. It was a shame we bought the expensive bags already that we thought we got a good bargain, not at all...the morrocan people are very clever in getting tourist money. We felt that we only enjoyed the riad accommodations experiencing the Moroccan culture but no thanks to the everyday scams and scums, deceiver, cheaters, liars and harassment as soon as we stepped out of our riad accommodations. We will never come back, never again! You've been warned..... Don't trust those people trying to help, they want money in return. Morrocan people see tourist as walking money, just money trying to take a piece of money.

Stall holders can be rude, be respectful and careful. Ask for a price and be prepared to barter, don't expect a decent price if on a private tour. Also don't expect your tour guide to actually STOP at the main stalls. He will instead take you to the most expensive stalls deep inside where he gets a cut from any sale. I got quite annoyed. Be firm and request loudly that you wish to stop or he will not! You will see how argan oil is made and taken upstairs to buy some, less expensive than home, but don't be tempted. Instead find a local grocery store in the medina and buy it for next to nothing, local priced.... They speak French here, our Hotel had no English speaking people until the next morning, I really had to stretch my school French to request a meal in the hotel, hilarious! The clothes can be sold in huge piles, someone starts yelling and a pile appears and women flock. They cannot try on clothes due to a religious need to remain covered. They hold the clothes to their bodies and buy them this way. The medina is beautiful, rich in its utter foreign feel, surrounded by sights and sounds you've never experienced before. Beware do not take photos of the snakes on the ground or you will be hastily asked for money for the privilege. Likewise the colourful water carriers. Being grabbed by the arm and having money demanded not in English, was frightening, so be aware. Don't blindly follow people with cards that say they are of the community, you are led down a very narrow alley with a dead end. We bolted. But there are wonderful experiences to be had, having a turban put on my husband for a photo, the camels placed at the cross roads, nice stall holders who didn't frighten us off. The skins of unimagininable animals hanging for sale, the slippers made from skins that I called yeti boots! The lanterns hanging altogether, amazing sights. They sell jewellery for three different skin colours, white, brown and black, to suit each skin colour. The plastic cheap things didn't add to its awe, they have even crept in here..."

Leave the map, leave the plans and simply stroll through this medievel throw-back of a rabbit warren, but allow time. Not a couple of hours but two or three days.Day one you'll walk for miles (and miles!) in circles and become, seemingly, hopelessly lost. You will arrive back at your accommodation wondering how you haven't been runover by one of the moped riding lunatics, and battered by the total assault on your senses. Day two you'll begin to get your mind around the countless souks scattered hither and yon at random. The myriad (apparent) dead-ends which aren't; the mini-souks inside the main souks; the lunatics on mopeds. By day three you should find that you can find you way around reasonably well..... but you will still constantly find things you missed. Don't worry; if you were there for a month you'd still be finding bits you'd missed! The locals will constantly try to help by pointing you in the direction of the square; this is genuine help and given freely. Oh, and never be afraid to ask for help; the locals are a pleasure to deal with and unstintingly helpful.As you wander past (and through) the countless stalls that make up the medina, don't be afraid to look. Look, touch, feel, smell - if there is the remotest possibility of a sale then the locals are helpfulness personified; should you feel like not buying, then a firm 'no' is (99% of the time) all that is needed......... but if you decide that you want to buy, then the fun starts. Haggle. Haggle, haggle and haggle again. It's expected and the locals openly admit it! What-ever the opening price is is approximately at least two to three times what they expect to recieve for the goods - so haggle and enjoy the experience........ but never forget that you can still walk away! (... and walking off can be part of the haggling process too!)So, wear sensible walking shoes (and -- importantly -- walk on the right!), trust the locals, trust yourself and enjoy the experience........ it's well worth it!"

Then I realised that it depends what are you looking for on your holidays. Definitely too busy for me, everyone wants to talk to you, they you grab your hand ... Which made me feel uncomfortable and quite sacred. A lady just grabbed my hand and started doing henna in less than a minute my hand was done ... And off course asked for money. Obviously asked for an absurd amount of money My boyfriend didn't want to take the money in front of her, because she would ask for more or someone could just come and grab it and run away with it, we could not risk it. so we told her we would come back to pay her, she followed us demanding her money and I told her why we wouldn't take the money in front of us and she then understood. It's definitely a morning destination and not afternoon or evening because it really put me off and I just wanted to leave. It's great for shopping and loads of food stalls.We went on a cafe with a rooftop for tea and off course to take some pictures of the busy square. Another thing everyone needs to be aware are the taxis and the road. When we were dropped off in was madness to cross the road, you literally have To risk and make the car or bikes stop. There is no rules. Taxis will charge you whatever they want. Same journey you will pay different tariffs. Be aware most places you shouldn't pay more than 70 dhm. We were like that found a driver who was really nice and gave us his number and charged 50dhm to everywhere and even gave us a tour to literally everywhere for 150dhm and would wait for us."

It was really bad, the instrument was not working and I had blotches all over my hand but didn't care as it was free and it is temporary. She then demanded 4000 dirhams, that's nearly \u00a3350!!!! I refused and said that they said it was free for good luck. They started shouting in Arabic and to avoid the stress I gave her \u00a320, she demanded more so gave her another \u00a310. Then she demanded more for the other lady. I gave her another \u00a320 and walked straight back to the hotel. It was intense. The henna washed off in three days."

Like in many other cities in this part of the world, you feel lost every time you turn a corner. the greatest reason in Marrakesh is that the houses all have the same shape and colour.A reddish, earthen colour that speaks to your senses. I advise you to walk if you can - it is not a very big medina, and if you get lost, there is always someone who is happy to help you. Except with one thing - so maybe I should click very good instead of excellent? I wanted to see the Majorelle Garden, and according to my guide book it should be open. However, we met, on our way there, two people who each of them, separately, told us it was closed today and would open tomorrow. OK, we had only half a day here - so why waste it on walking up to something closed? We changed our plans - and later in the evening found out from a government guide that Majorelle was NOT closed...But now it was too late to go there...I was NOT happy. The two people who had told us obviously lied, and for no reason at all it seems, because they were not selling anything. Nothing to gain by tricking us... The only thing it lead up to was anger, frustration and sowing distrust.To sum it up - we really had a not that good day, our first day here. Do not trust anyone, is the sad message."

We stayed at a Riad within the Medina and spent the majority of our time within the old walls simply because it offered a cauldron of character and history generally lacking in the new town. Some areas were easy enough to navigate, whereas the souks were very easy to get lost in because of generally poor signage, labyrinthine layout and the lack of long sight views. There's plenty to see and do within the city walls for a few days at least and although the hassling is a great nuisance initially, one gets used to handling it after a day or two. It is worth saying that many locals will genuinely try to be helpful without ulterior motives; however, there are some who will latch onto easy prey simply to pressure sell or extract money for 'guiding'; unfortunately, this tends to make one wary of accepting any unsolicited approach. It is important to be alert mainly due to the volume of two wheel traffic that insists on traveling at speed in unsuitable narrow streets; having said that we didn't see a single accident in the five days we were there."

This is a culture of giving which in turn encourages begging. I did not get hassled by beggars like in other cities but there are a lot of them here. 2. Don't be afraid to get lost. This is part of the charm to the medina so if you need to go somewhere by a specific time, leave extra time to get lost a little. If you do get lost, buy a small water bottle for 2dirham and then ask the shopkeeper for directions. They will gladly help you now. 3. Wear sunglasses, the shopkeepers are watching you to see what you're interested in and if they think they have a chance to convince you to buy something because you looked at it or touched it then they will engage more with you. Sunglasses make it harder to read you and therefore they are less likely to bother with you.4. Put your money in different groups and then different pockets. This way if you pull out your money you are less likely to draw attention to you because you are not showing that much cash. 5 Soak in the sounds and smells. It is easy to take in the sights but the sounds and smells are just as magical and they make it so unique. 6. Stay in a riad with a good rooftop terrace. I stayed in Dar Hannane and it was excellent. The terrace appeared to be one of the highest and nicest. I enjoyed breakfast on the rooftop every morning and the peacefulness of the riad in the morning is awesome!7. Be smart and mindful but do not be afraid. I was afraid before I arrived but after one night it felt like a home away from home. 8. Stay away from the guys with the monkeys unless you're u REALLY want to pay for a picture. I just went to the overlooking cafe rooftops and peacefully took pictures from above."

Wandering around this ancient market area, you'll immediately know where all the Hollywood stereotypes come from--and I mean that in the best way possible: goats, donkeys, mopeds, and hordes of humans wandering purposively through the complicated, sprawling Moroccan maze. Do yourself a favor, and just get lost. Wander, shop, eat, photograph, chat with locals (including the aggressive shopkeepers, over tea of course) and other travelers, and take it all in--keeping in mind that you are in a place which will celebrate its 1000th birthday in 2062. You are participating in a vibrant continuity of culture that was in place well before Genghis Khan was born; a place that predates the beginning of the Crusades. Let your imagination run wild and celebrate your presence in the middle of the headwaters of modern human history.Short version: Marrakech's medina is really really old, and really really cool."

Marrakech has a wide variety of sights and sounds. Plus more than enough shops to satisfy the pickiest shopaholic.My advice is find where the locals eat and go there. The first night we were overwhelmed with the number of people and chose a restaurant with a terrace that over looked the square. The food was good however we had much better meals and for a fraction of the price at other eating establishments.There is so much to see that you absolutely need a good pair of walking shoes. We started our holiday in Marrakech and ended in Fez. We found the shopping better in Marrakech but the prices better in Fez. Or maybe it was better bartering skills after spending a week in Morocco?????The fresh OJ is delicious. Watch for the dates and baked goods behind glass counters. We saw several flies and insects attracted to the sweets. There are bakeries where the goodies are behind shut glass cases and items are sold by the grams.Immerse yourself in the Medina and enjoy the experience."

You can find all sorts here from snake charters to show stalls to food places to pharmacies and iPhone shops. People are normally quite pleasant but some will take you for a ride. Taxis are everywhere hoping for customers and will if not careful run you over if the numerous mopeds don't first. Dress appropriately if you do not want to attract attention. Be careful of you purses and bags as there are a lot of pick pockets. Also when given a price this is always way to much. Always haggle. Do a lot of window shopping to find right place. The further inside the stalls the cheaper it is generally. For example silk scarves will be 100 dh outside and only 10 deeper inside. Be warned of snake charmers they will desend on you and demand money for pictures. Same with the guys with monkeys. Also I do not advise anyone get henna tattoos, once these women have you they literally don't stop or let go of your arm. Best not to engage with them. The experience is somewhat different and will definitely put you out of your comfort zone."

When it comes price as usual got surprised as foreigner and local friends too, so we politely said bye and moved out, and what gentlemen happily said bye even not purchased.Moved and inquired with three other shops, but i was not quite satisfied my mind fully loaded with that shop and compare with other shops his price was not bad, plus more I like the way he presented the product to us he never ever talk about other shop or how they make it. Rest all of the guys talk about other shop product instead their product it sounds really fishy and I decided to buy from the first shop even if price higher or lesser.Again back to him, he was very happy to see us and started extract the oil from argan seed in front of us and explain each product how and whats the medicinal effects, with such wonderful 25 years experience and coming from Atlas mountain tribal background this gentleman is gem for that shop. He speak Arabic fluent,French and English.He dont need education how to sell and market product..... not even once he talked about other shop or other people. Genuinely focused of his product and showing each with clear details.We finally bought oil and other stuff also took his business card for future purchase or recommend others.One of good hearted person recently I met in this commercial world, If need any further details please write to me I will be very happy to give complete information for this place.Enjoy discovering.....Asif"

The oranges which they are famous for can be bought from stalls and squeezed into juice. They are the most delicious oranges I have every had. It all closes up at about 12pm, that is when we where there, maybe longer if in season. If one tries to take pictures they want you to pay, and get angry if you do not. When all is over the whole square is washed so it is all clean by morning. We found it to be safe and also noticed a lot of tourist females there all alone.

Most maps are rubbish in helping you navigate ( especially in the souks). \"HERE Maps\" app. using GPS was recommended to me afterwards.DO NOT photograph ANY local individuals with out asking, even if they are 20 yards away. They may allow you, usually with a fee.Otherwise you will be threatened and verbally attacked until you pay them. Do not photograph anywhere near the Palaces or their guards. Otherwise it could get nasty as I found out. Someone did try to pick my pocket, so keep your money hidden and deep. There is also a scam with a crazy man that corners you, if someone offers to help, tell him also to GO AWAY. As he will offer to take you somewhere and demand \u00a38(100 Dir or more) Follow these rules and you should be fine. Unless you are a hardened traveler and streetwise, use a recognized local guide who will ensure everything will be fine and stress free. I had a real stressful adventure on my own but it's not for everyone. The miles of shops in the Souks are mostly all the same so there is no need to over visit them. 30 mins should be enough for a tourist."

Anyway, the sights and sounds are a real experience, as is the hard sell from the souk sellers, henna ladies, watch sellers, snake charmers, etc. I'd already been warned not to let the henna ladies get hold of my hand and they got quite frustrated that I wasn't going to stupidly hold my hand out before agreeing on a price. I ended up walking away with one of them following behind me relentlessly! The sales patter in general was harmless and a quick but firm \"la shukran\" (no thank you) and they left you alone. I'd say that the whole experience was a physical assault on the senses with motor bikes, cats, welding, shouting, food, etc all around you but it was a memorable experience that I'm glad I got to have, and won't ever forget."

Also saw a lady selling Henna grab a girls hand and draw on her before she could say no - then chase her round with another lady demanding payment. Lots of cafes around the edge, none sell alcohol though. Side streets full of tented markets, DO barter - you WILL get the price down. I'm not one for that sort of thing, but our friend was saving loads of money by doing this. Do head down the Horse road (you'll see it) and turn right - keep on up this road to see some lovely gardens and eventually get to the New Town. This area is much better for shopping."

You may be tempted by the beutiful Riads, but if you are not experienced in the Morrocan culture or are not very confident travelers, I would recomend staying in the new part of Marrakesh, and visiting the Medina within an organised group. The roads can be very daunting, with cars, scooters, bikes, pedestrians and Donkeys all competing to get down very narrow roads! It can be quite fun! There are also many beautiful Mosques to visit - although you cannot get inside unless you are of their faith, the outsides are a work of art. Well worth a visit!"

As a woman I would not go alone unless in a hotel immediately on the central Jmaa el fna square. The reason is that the alleyways particularly on the northern edges of the Medina are full of touts waiting to try to ensnare/guide you for money. Do NOT allow anyone to guide you anywhere unless an official guide planned in advance. Take a map. Cover up if female. Only ask women the way. Ideally stay near square so don't get lost. Eat in the square at night? Number One food stall was great! Aroma cafe out of the square opposite the mosque was lovely for tea. Walk in the mosque gardens. If rich go to Mammonia hotel for tea (\u00a315 two cups tea but worth it)."

If you like haggling, then you will love this place. Prices start at crazy high amounts, and more than often, one should pay about 20% - 30% of the original asking price! Personally, I did not purchase anything off the souks this time around, as you can often find some decent fixed price shops around the square, and no haggling needed! One should also note, don't start bargaining for a product you have no interest in - it is very difficult afterwards to say no, as the shopkeeper will take offence especially if he or she comes down to your asking price. In fact, I would take it further and not even pick up an item unless I'm very sure I will buy it. Even just looking at items is frustrating as you will not be left alone. Not all the souks are like this, but the majority are. It's best to know what you want and what you are willing to pay for it, and stick to that. Don't back down - in the end, if it is a reasonable price that you are offering, they will accept it.Also, it is very easy to get lost in the souks - you can always check up high to see some signs which direct you back to the main square (though even some of these have been vandalised). Never take the offer of someone showing you how to get somewhere unless you want to give a few euros/pounds/dirhams to those who are directing you. Of course, if you lost in a major way, best to ask some children, who will be more than happy to help for a few dirhams. I suggest everyone carry a map or if you have a tablet, download a map beforehand and use GPS to get you where you want to go - though the GPS signal is quite weak in this part of the world! I found the signs on top of the souks to be the most helpful.If this is your first visit to Marrakech, you should definitely visit the souks, but be alert and be confident. Know what you want and how much you want to pay and walk away if you don't get it. Keep it simple, and friendly and you may even enjoy some of this bargaining!"

The hotel was easily enough to get to but you certainly needed a taxi to get you into the heart of the Medina. The Medina is an amazing place where the frenetic hustle and bustle will harangue you and you will be continually pestered by the many hawkers and traders. Browsing without paying for anything is not an option here and many traders start to get shirty with tourists who simply 'look'. In fact, the traders will harangue you incessantly, trying to sell you their various wares at exorbitant prices. The haggling is exhausting and can be extremely tiresome after the first hour within the Medina. The food and eating out is incredibly cheap and the food, as long as it is piping hot, is excellent. The restaurants are many and those geared up for tourists do sell alcohol. Even the most expensive of eateries will set you back forty quid, with two dining. Please only drink bottled water. The poverty is inescapable and the begging can be tricky to avoid though it is advisable to refrain from giving anything as a swarm of individuals will descend upon you for rich pickings. Please, please do not seek any directions from unofficial 'guides', who will take you to your destination then ask you for a ridiculous amount of money. They will not leave you alone if you refuse. One 'guide' demanded twenty Euros from us after taking us on a merry dance around in a circle. We refused and tried to disappear in a restaurant. The 'guide' waited outside until we finished and continued his demands. A heated argument in both English and Arabic resulted in the restaurant staff giving him five Euros to get rid of him on our behalf. The wares from the markets if haggled ruggedly are cheap. Close your eyes to the feral cats and dogs and try and avoid observing the treatment of ponies and donkeys. The Medina is a destination for the most intrepid of travellers."

Once you show a modicum of interest, the battle is engaged.This is not a battle for the shy or reticent, but one for the patient, polite, good humoured, and slightly stubborn. One will not win every skirmish but with fortitude will eventually come to an agreement that both combatants will accept with a smile and handshake. There are many products and crafts to view down the endless maze of alleys and tiny side streets.Into the mix are food vendors and restaurants generating exotic and sometimes enticing aromas. Though alcohol is banned from Medina, several of the nicer looking establishments on the fringes will offer a cold beer or local wine.The usual personal precautions should be taken while moving about this crowded market. Keep valuables locked down and hidden away.Shopping is not the only pursuit. Embedded in the Medina are palaces and museums. If you are able to disengage from the market battlefield, these are well worth seeking out.Good luck and have fun."

We were advised before we left if we got involved in haggling to settle for between 30% and 50% of the sellers initial offer and this seemed to work fine. Even if you do not intend to buy anything it is worth a look just for the experience. Whist walking about I was approached by someone from a barber shop as I had 3 or 4 days of stubble on my chin so I decided to let him give me a shave, AMAZING he spent about 25 minutes during which time he shaved me 3 times before trimming eyebrows, ear and nose hair before buffing my skin up with a little machine containing talcum powder, I felt so relaxed afterwards, he asked for 50 dirhams (about \u00a33.50) and didn't even bother to try and haggle I just paid as it was well worth it.One thing to be aware of, we managed to lose our way and we were studying our map when we approached by a young male who asked me where I wanted to be, I told him by the main mosque and he said I was going in the wrong direction. I thanked him and began to walk in the right direction towards the mosque. He began to follow us and started chatting with me seemingly friendly enough but when the mosque came into view he demanded money from us when I refused he became aggressive and I ended up threatening him and saying I would call the police if he did not go away, as there was a police checkpoint about 50 yards away he left but that was the only downside of the day."

It is not for those of you that don't like busy, noisy places, filled with the smells of strong scents, foods and visual colour. A continuous array of folk wanting your attention and money......\"come buy in my store, good price...asda price\", \"come looky looky....looky is free\", \"come see genuine fake, genuine\". I love the banter and the bartering. The souk has a main square and then off the square are warrens where getting lost is to be expected. I have enjoyed meandering through and getting completely lost. I have also, upon occasion, paid a child to help me get back to the square. If time is no obstacle the sights through some of the tiniest alleys are incredible. watching incredible craftsmen working in cramped and filthy condition and yet producing masterpieces.It is a true Aladdin's treasure trove of experience. In the evening enjoy grabbing some food from one of the makeshift restaurants. There are hundreds to choose from, mostly selling the same sort of food. I always choose the busier ones as it meant the food had a higher turnover and so would be fresher! It worked for me!! There is no alcohol sold in these stands, so be warned.At dusk, as the evening sets, it is well worth visiting one of the bars that have a roof terrace....again, note the many don't serve alcohol and that a drink is compulsory to gain access to the rook top. The views of the main tower of the mosque, the spectacular skies, the smoke rising from the food stands, and noise of drumming, singing and people is fabulous...if that is your kind of thing!"

The soukh is a rabbit warren and it's easy to get lost, so try and remember where you've been and retrace your steps. Young men will offer to guide you but they will either take you to a relatives shop or say it's just around the corner (when it isn't) expecting payment and leave you just as lost as before. As with all Arab Souks you will find it hard to get out of a shop once you pause to look at something, but that's half the fun as is haggling.Jema el Fna is best at night. But you will be pestered. Women beware of women grabbing your hand and offering to put a Henna pattern on it. Pull your hand away immediately, Once they get some on, they want payment and can be quite aggressive and greedy about it. No matter that you didn't ask for it or agree.

She was whacked over her head extremely hard as we were all left watching the attacker causally walk away as we were trying to work out what had happened and if we still had all of our belongings.This is certainly not an attraction for solo or even a group of women. Despite being appropriately dressed including head coverings, the females were at war throughout in an attempt to avoid sleazy male attention.With a wider view, Marrakesh is an experience that not many people wish to experience more than once. Our entire group agreed that we could have done without experiencing it at all, and stuck to other areas of Morocco."

I'd advise not to go into stalls unless you have a genuine interest in buying. Otherwise you many end up buying things you don't want! And get involved in bartering. Whatever you pay will be way more than the locals. So have a crack and get involved.What I liked was the opportunity to get immersed in local culture. It's fast passed and frantic! There's so much on offer you'll be able to find everything you want and more. And watch out for mopeds! Locals tear around on them. And they're nippy! I absolutely loved this experience.

Local touts kept trying to tell us we were going the wrong way, even though we were following an entourage of local women with their children. When I wandered around alone, the touts would ask, \"Where are you going?\" I answered, \"Home,\" looked at my google map directions and walked off. There is so much to see there.

Which is a saying you will use hundreds of times a day in the medina. It is colorful and the energy is great. There are many things to see, the goods, the poverty, the way of life is all very interesting and is definitely worth a trip. I am glad to have seen it all, but it was also not as expected. I expected to spend a lot on gifts but ended up buying nothing. If you are a woman, dress as modestly as possible because you WILL get much unwanted attention. Wear comfortable shoes. You will get lost and likely walk hours more than anticipated. Many restaurants serve subpar food. Don't go to those who try to pull you in. We only had one good meal in three days, and although it was more than twice the price of the others, it still ended up being $22 for two. This was outside of the old city. If you must buy alcohol, go into the new city and there are many small shops. We happened upon many on accident. It was hard to \"Google\" where they were. If you are not shy, go to the stands where the locals buy the freshly cooked food. This is truly a unique experience but if you're like us and only get a vacation rarely, it is NOT a relaxing place to go. You will be walking a lot. You will be fighting off people who want your money. And when you think you've won, or you met someone genuinely nice, trying to show you someplace as they go their own (opposite) way, they will suddenly reappear in your face to point you again in the \"right\" direction. Don't be fooled. Never follow anyone's directions. They will tell you this special place is only open today, it is a lie. I wish I had known all of this prior to my visit."

We ate in small restaurants away from the centre for most of the time and whilst there was not much choice on the menu it was authentic, cheap and good to eat.There was not nearly as much hassle in the souks as I had expected although you get passed from pillar to post and are expected to tip if you end up anywhere near the Tanneries ( which is a smelly experience!). We didn't enjoy the Jemaa El Fna sqauare though. You have to go though. But it is hassle by day and night. Monkeys on chains and water bearers I think are there for tourists by day time nowadays. By night, it is busier and perhaps more authentic but noisier and crowded. We ate quite happily though at one of the market stalls without incident....but just he once."

Even though it was January the place was packed all the time. The main road through has pedestrians, cars, motor bikes and bicycles. Then there are the trades people with their donkey carts as well. It seems every motorized vehicle is badly tuned as you could see the blue oil air as you passed through two particularly tight passages. It made me nauseous if I didn't cover my nose. This is home to thousands of locals, add in all the tourists and it is crazy. We are really staunch anti shoppers and pretty much kept away from the sellers or \"guides\", unwanted but still wanting to be paid is they go any small distance with you. The tanneries, at least the small animal one we visited required a payoff to the \"cousin\" (insert relative type here), the tannery tour guide and the retail shop person where you are led. They do get huffy if you don't buy, but we only have a backpack and carry-on and just aren't buyers. The dyers market has no visibility to the actual dying process, retail only. We were offered a scarf for 700MAD which kept dropping until we finally left. The same scarf around the corner was being offered at 50MAD. We did enjoy watching the craftsmen working their metal, wood, leather and what have you. Watching the neighborhood baker rotate breads into and out of his huge oven was almost mesmerizing. Outside the walls on Thursday (but almost every day) is a market that people bring anything and everything to trying to make a few coins on. The average local makes about $8 a day. If you eat at a restaurant ask if the waiter can have the leftovers to take home, really. The animal acts are mostly in the square, not in the heart of the medina. Schools get out at noon and you really don't want to be just walking around then. It is real to the locals, they are trying to make the best deal for themselves at your expense. If you aren't interested in buying do not go into a stall. Do not make eye contact and if someone asks \"where are you from\" turn around and walk away. A couple of Arabic phrases I learned are: \"La Choukran\" (no thank you); \"Khallini\" (leave me alone) and with exclamation marks in your voice \"Safi!\" (Enough). Speaking in their language seems to work most often. We never felt unsafe and the souks are fascinating if you follow these tips."

The central square Jemaa El Fna is mainly for the tourist where, Snake Charmers, Fortune Tellers and Men with Monkeys spend the day trying to convince you that you should part with some of your money!! This is the daytime adventure. After dark a multitude of food stalls appear which are cheap and, in our experience containing wholesome dishes. This place can become somewhat overpowering.

I first visited Marrakech in 2008 and was mesmerized by the colourful markets, labyrinth style back alleys, energetic shopkeepers and the magic of the Djemaa el-Fna where African and Arabian traders have converged for centuries. No matter how hard you tried you just could not take a bad photograph.I ventured back this year and whilst the city still held its romantic appeal, it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It seems everyone wants a piece of you, there seems to be a glut of faux guides coaxing you to part with your money to surreptitiously get you around the Medina. And if you're a woman, good luck with the constant hassle and attention. It has got a lot dirtier and people seem to care less (I witnessed defecating by the city walls). The traffic has also greatly increased and the congestion and pollution with it. Crossing the road will add a few grey hairs. For some reason the Medina is now full of scooters who wiz past with no care for pedestrians, even my mother was clipped by one. Many taxis will rip you off and if you book a tour for 8am, don't expect to pick you up before 10am! And those photographs? Well now just be prepared to part with some cash (again) as people just appear demanding payment for you having taken their photo (even if you didn't!). Speaking to the Riad owner (now many of these Riad's are an oasis of calm and truly beautiful in design and comfort), he told me he's selling up as Marrakech is going down the plughole since the recession and there is an air of desperation around the city. Then there's always the terrorist threat at the back of your mind (Egypt and Tunisia still fresh in the memory). Yet many visitors tend to forget that the main square In Marrakech itself was attacked as recently as 2011 with many of these restaurants today having airport style security measures to get in. The Djemaa el-Fna is still amazing but be prepared to see chained monkeys, snakes and other forms of animal cruelty. As for souvenirs are you seriously going to use a tagine back home or for that matter wear yellow leather babouches around the house? For good food many of the Western restaurants are over priced and the local cuisine, whilst a pleasant change at first gets a bit samey. As for getting alcohol in the old city, this was an Indiana Jones style quest in itself. For the foreigner there's an unsettling air in the city, gone is the exotic Marrakech of wonder, intoxication and sensory overload. Sure it's an emerging country, but I have been to plenty in my travels and ones as diverse as Colombia, Brazil, India, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Belarus and more. I get the appreciation of different cultures and am all for new enlightened experiences. So what was the difference between these countries and Morocco? Simple; politeness, friendliness, respect and safety."

Buy spices or cakes, eat tagine or buy a pair of shoes - but never take the first price - better devide it with 2 or 3 before buying haha. People are used to tourists especially in the medina so you find tons of stuff. Across the path to the hotel essaouira near djemaa El Fna was a small pottery with a really humble and calm artist with reasonable prices. Can recommend this shop since he let you browse through this 3 sqm room that he calls is shop stuffed with beautiful plates and stuff. He wont even try to lur you back in when you decide to not buy anything at all. Really quite and peaceful and such a nice and humble character. Deeper in the medina/ souks be aware that these kids hanging around the corners (where you going? You know the tannerys? No? I can show you its on my way - really) get paid for bringing you to the tannerys (not directly because luckily there is a random being who can take us the rest of the way since he has to go left now - yeah right) where you get talked into a \"tour\" aka look-around-the-place and when finished they force you to pay way too much. One girl accompaning us was so brave and stood up against that. We got tricked into the tour which started off as a free look around and all of the sudden the guy wanted money for showing us (i mean at a certain point we knew he would want something for letting us in the tannery - but i doubt that he actually owned it or so - but he really began to act aggressivly). Money for himself and the other people who led us there (its really not that obvious in the beginning but after a while you sense there is something going on... ) So this girl just kept saying that he told us its free and even when he got kind of purpelish while arguing with her and us intensly she did not let them scare her. More men came and argued and tried to convince her and us to pay more. He looked so angry the situation became really uncomfortable and me and my sister just paid 40 dh together and just wanted to leave. You know at a certain point its just enough.. But when he turned to this other girl - we met at our hostel and who explored the city with us together - with his hand still ready to collect more money she really stood up for herself and told him that she works in the tourist industry and that his behaviour is just so bad-mannered she never experienced it before. We really felt kind of weak for paying him. She was so brave and all. So we told him that he should tell people before the tour so people know what to expect and are able to choose if they want a \"guided tour\" or not. In the end he just send us away, still angry but kind of - i dont know - understanding (?!), too, and so we left and we were just glad we got out of there. Akward... but the \"tour\" itself (us walking around the tannery) talking to some of the workers, etc. was really informative and interesting. Just be aware of that. And enjoy Marrakesh - this is just a not-so-nice but not dangerous travel story. Most people are good. Some a bit annoying ... but not bad :)"

I honestly felt safe the whole time, but I did always keep an eye on my things and had everything close to me and closed. Just be smart and you will be fine. You will get to see all kinds of things to be sold here. If you are interested in anything, ask the price... they will always give you a crazy high one. You say no. They they will drop it or say how much do you want to pay. Say honestly what you are willing to pay, and then they will say no. When that happens say oh well, no thank you and start walking away. You will see the price drop like crazy until you hear the price you want. Best of luck."

We enjoyed sitting in the rooftop terrace cafes looking down on jemaa el fna and eating at the stalls in the evening, but would have enjoyed wandering about the souks so much more if we could have done it with less hassle. The main thing to warn other people about is bag snatching - a man on a motorbike slashed my bag strap and drove off with my bag and its entire contents - this was nearly 9pm in the evening, on one of the roads near the medina wall not far from our riad, so always be on the look out. never drop your guard, and now I would never carry my valuables around in a handbag, I will always keep everything well hidden under my clothes."

Enjoy the bartering and get the best price you can. Be very aware of pick pockets especially when watching the music or dancing and looking at stalls, just the same as you would in any City.

Find below our day spend at Medina - We had stayed over at Riad Andalla in the Medina, right next to the Jemaa el Fna - the central square and the epicenter of the madness. There are many tourist attractions to visit, the major one beings - Ben Youssef Madrasa, Museum of Marrakesh & Maison de la Photographie at one end meaning within 3 minutes of each other. 15 to 20 minutes away on the other side is the Bahia Palace, El Badi Palace, Saadian Tombs & the Kasbah Mosque. All these sites can be covered under four hours. Had our lunch in one of the road side cafes at Jemaa el Fna, with dessert from one of the pastries shops. Some how we never enjoyed the Moroccan dishes in these cafes, what we did enjoy was the shawarmas & doner kebabs. Next we explored the Medina with the agenda of shopping, there are great bargains to be had here. The prices differ drastically from shops to shops, the deeper you go into the Medina the cheaper the goods will become. For best prices, try to buy goods from the shops targeting the locals, most are away from the main square. I bought earrings for 10 MAD, medium size knifes for 200 to 300 MAD, medium size metal worked ceramic plates at 100 Mad. After dropping our goodies at the Riad, we went for a superb Hammam/Message at Isis Spa. The Hammam was a first time unique experience, the message among the best i have ever had. By now it was evening and we hit Jemaa el Fna to experience the atmosphere of the place. The Medina besides being a tourist attraction is actually meant for the locals. Those living nearby come here to shop & for other services like medicine (saw this awesome Berber medicine shop, refer my pic). In the evenings Jemaa el Fna is the entertainment destination for the locals,the performances are in Moroccan language and the local drink it all up. Everyone who comes to Marrakech will land up in Medina, my suggestion is stay in the Medina if you are in town for just a day or two but if you plan a longer stay look at Gueliz for bigger & better rooms at lower prizes."

I tried to avoid the henna ladies it is really difficult and had a really bad 'drawing' on my hand because she was so insistent - and I am allergic to the henna! Apparently some of the snakes are stuffed but you only find out when you have paid to take a photo.

Consider a proper guide if you are not used to this type of thing. I am well travelled and the Medina streets are confusing with no view to get bearings on anything. You cannot travel in straight lines and all streets look the same.Most locals are friendly and helpful, though still trying to make money. However away from the square there is organised crime where young boys and teenagers are used to catch your attention, distract you, offer to show you somewhere and take you nowhere and then charge you. You will pick up the tell tale signs and words. They will have an elder 'minder' somewhere around who will appear when you tell him to get lost, often on a small motorbike."

I visited the Medina twice and had two very different experiences. On the first trip I was shown around by a registered tour guide and I loved it and found it utterly fascinating. One minute there was sensory overload with the sights and the sounds and the next we were exploring quiet alleyways and side streets. The second time I went on my own and found the entire experience intimidating. The crowds and shop keepers banter I could cope with. However as a single female traveller in her mid 40s who dressed very modestly so only my hands and head were uncovered and wearing sun glasses to avoid eye contact, I didn't expect the level of male attention I received. When I was in the Kasbah I got lost looking for El Badi Palace and ended up in a quiet residential street, a man shouted out to me that the road ahead was closed. I ignored me and continued and he followed me for 3 - 4 minutes until I realised that the street was a cul de sac. When I turned back I realise me was waiting for me. I don't know he wanted, I assumed money to show me the way back to the main street, but I found the thought of being followed down an empty street very frightening and intimidating. I tried to kept my wits about me although I felt scared and then I saw a door opening and a woman and her child coming out. So I started to shout at the man to stop following me and to leave me alone and he left. From that experience I realise that I needed to stay on the main streets where other people were about.I eventually found my way out and then made my way to the souks. As I walked around I ignored the shop keepers banter but as I continued walking I arrived at a busy area filled with local people. As I walked along although the street was crowded disrespectful, sexist comments were shouted at me by young men. This went on until I managed to get myself back to the main tourist area by this time I'd had enough. I felt worn out with the verbal battering and I decided I wouldn't visit the medina again."

My wife Allyson laughing at my ego! Well on our final day, I got cocky; we decided to just go for a walk into the centre of the Kasbah and Medina, my confidence was high! Four hours later and a few Dirhams lighter, we eventually found our bearings to get back on track! Luckily enough we got taken to The Tazir Hotel, which thankfully is the only bar in the old town that sells beer ;-) at a cost of 35 Dirhams for a small bottle of Heineken, but who cares? After the ordeal of me getting us well and truly lost on a road to nowhere the beer was worth the price! Mo sells wine back at the Riad El Farah, which for about \u00a310 per bottle is reasonable, rather than the stress of bartering in the Zouks. Alcohol is banned in the Old Town due to respect for the Arab religion. "

It's great for one to experience places like this in a lifetime but do be prepared for things that you'll only see in a James Bond movie.Baskets, snake charmers, monkeys on chains and hundreds and hundreds of vendors trying to persuade you that their collection of homemade bric-a-brac is better than the next row along.It's exciting and at the same time a little bit scary in places. If you don't like tight space you can stick to the main square right in the centre of the old town but if you go down through the maze of streets you'll see things for sale straight from fairy tales. Oh and things for sale that you think.... why? for example the guy selling an array of dentures and real teeth, yep... a teeth guy.The vendors are just doing their job by pestering you to come and look at their stuff so go in with an open mind. If you don't like pushy sales people, simply don't go, you'll hate it.Be VERY CAREFUL of motorcycles. They speed through the streets in narrow lanes so you need to be constantly alert and move out of their way quite quickly. I don;t mean just a couple in a day, I mean at least two or three every minute will pass you in narrow streets. Again, if you have little or no tolerance to dangerous driving, don't go.Haggling is part of the fun here but there's no hard and fast rules to getting a good price, just be courteous but not too dumb looking, don't be rude and do shop around. That's easier said than done when you want to move on, the vendor will do anything to keep you there so that's your time to get his lowest price.If you look rich and have big gold rings and a 2000 dollar camera around your neck, you can bet you'll pay double the price of the next guy so play the game and have fun..... just think of the Life Of Brian movie ..... \"You're supposed to haggle....\"You will get lost and people will try and help you find your way around but just politely and repeatedly say something like \"I'm not buying anything, I'm just looking around\"Also remember you're under no obligation to give money to anyone for anything you don't want so have fun looking if that's what you want to do."

Maybe later) Try to look confident and don't be afraid of insulting a trader by offering far to little - it doesn't bother them asking an astronomical first price!In the evening investigate the story tellers and groups of musicians - even without the language you can spot the 'game' that the entertainers use to increase the amount of money they are given by the audience before they commence their show. Take part with a few small coins and before you know it you are being ushered to the front and you wife given a seat (that someone not willing to play has been ejected from)."

People are shouting at you so you buy things, they really try to get you into their shops, restaurants or whatever. Women just grab your hand and put Henna on it and if you take a picture and people notice you took one in their direction (even though they're not in it), they want money for it. When you go and sit outside for a snack or lunch, people approach you and try to sell you Phones, clocks and other stuff."

The Medina is an ancient working city full of characters of all possible descriptions. Watch out for agressive begging, agressive selling, people directing you in the wrong direction, people harassing you, telling you that where you are going is closed or there are women there and you can't go, likewise there is a Mosque and you can't go.Once you have got over all the negatives there are so many positives that thet whole place is breath taking. I would advise you to check out the main square early in the day prior to making an evening visit. The evenings can get very very crowded. look out for pickpockets at the end of the main square towards the shops and banks.Brilliant place, lots of lovely eating places and a good place to see a working city in the raw."

            "review": "Ten useful tips for travellers in Morocco. I have been to Morocco three times now, and I feel I\u2019ve seen enough of it to share a few useful tips for first time travellers to this country.Despite my previous post, where I talked about how annoying it can sometimes be to be pestered by the locals, I would like to stress that I actually love this country, and I will keep coming back. But it does help to keep these little tips in mind!1. Bargain over everythingYes, it\u2019s OK to bargain over the price of a taxi. Or the amount you paid for your street breakfast. It is positively expected that you will have a lengthy \u2018discussion\u2019 over the price you are paying for anything you buy in a stall or shop, and it is just as much of a given that you will walk away having paid two or three times more than the locals.On our latest trip to Morocco, my friends and I met an retired American man who spent six months every year in Morocco, and the other six in America. \u201cI can get a bread for half a dirham, a tomato for another half a dirham, and I\u2019ve got myself a tomato sandwich for a dirham,\u201d he told us, as we were paying 100 dirham (somehow??!) for our own breakfast, which wasn\u2019t even that lavish. One dirham is around 7p to you and me\u2026the same taxi that we paid 50 dirham for that morning cost him 11 dirham, he added. You just have to know how to push.The only exception, it seems, is when the price is written down. \u201cFixed price\u201d, they call it. I have never been to a Moroccan supermarket, but I imagine there isn\u2019t much bargaining to be done there. Neither can you really bargain in expensive restaurants and the like. Everywhere else, it seems to be fair game!2. Never agree to follow men on the street for directions,even if you are mega-lostWhen you first arrive in Marrakesh, prepare to be majorly overwhelmed. The place is a maze that doesn\u2019t even make sense to the locals, and no matter how detailed the directions you are given by your hostel or riad, if you are staying inside the old city there is no chance you will find where you are staying within the first hour.And guess what looks like easy money to young Moroccan men who can speak a smidgen of English? Tired and lost-looking tourists! Unless you are in a very central area with millions of other tourists around, the local boys will descend upon you like vultures. Don\u2019t even think of following one of them for directions! They will lead you around in circles for ages and then demand money when you finally get there.Instead, try to ask women or old men, even if it means communicating with hand gestures. If you can speak French \u2013 use it! If you don\u2019t, maybe brush up on your travel phrases before going. Some shop owners can be quite helpful as well, but try to avoid the young males. Consider ordering a good map before heading to Marrakesh, and also keep the phone number of the hostel handy. We have had to be rescued by the hostel owners once when we simply couldn\u2019t find our way, and were being harassed left, right and centre by local boys trying to offer \u2018help\u2019.3. Don\u2019t buy sweets from a cart in the main squareThey don\u2019t taste as good as they look! At all. In the evening, you will see men rushing around with these carts filled with local sweets, offering boxes of 12 for 50 dirham (just over \u00a33). But they tend to be a bit stale and stodgy, and are probably best used as a table decoration than food (although we ate all the ones we bought on the first night there anyway).Instead, find some chebakiya if you want some proper Moroccan sweets. They are the cheapest ones by far, and the tastiest! A big box, even in the most touristy area, shouldn\u2019t cost you more than 30 dirham. You can find it being sold inside the main markets (souks) by dedicated merchants, or in smaller portions with tea in the main square in the evening. It\u2019s essentially a pasty rolled up in the shape of a rose, deep fried until golden and covered in a syrup made from honey and rose water. It is divine! Although also very sickly, and definitely not at all good for you.4. Bring some ImodiumThe food in Morocco varies, but it is certainly not for everyone\u2019s stomachs, and although it is nothing as bad as I would imagine India to be, you are quite likely to get a case of the traveller\u2019s tummy at some point during your trip. You can buy Imodium in Morocco if you forget to bring it \u2013 all pharmacies should sell it, it has the same name and it isn\u2019t particularly expensive.Some tips I found useful to try and avoid having to resort to drugs include asking for no ice in your drinks, watching that anything with eggs is really well cooked, even if you prefer them runny, and same goes for meat. Also, probably best to stay away from the orange juice stands in the main square. But to be honest, if you eat street food (or ever end up in a Moroccan or Berber kitchen, for that matter), you will be exposed to a much larger variety of dirt and grime than you are at home. That\u2019s simply a fact you will have to live with, unless you would rather splash out on a five star hotel with a five star restaurant for your whole stay. But that\u2019s not my style!5. Brush up on your FrenchPeople do speak English in Morocco, and many of them speak far more languages than you and I are used to in our insulated UK-based lives (probably not the case for those readers based outside the UK\u2026) When we were climbing in Todra Gorge, many Berbers surprised us by being proficient in Spanish, and some Italian, on top of French, Arabic and English. But you will be better off if you remember some basic phrases, so you can ask for directions, and not confuse your right with your left when you are given them. Or make sure the waiter knows you definitely want your umpteenth cup of tea sans sucre!I swear I spoke more different languages (that I didn\u2019t even know I could speak!) during my week in Morocco in December than over the course of the whole year prior to that. And that\u2019s considering the fact that last year saw me trying to hold a conversation with my climbing partner\u2019s Italian grandma in Italian. Which I have never learnt.6. Don\u2019t be afraid of staying in hostelsBut maybe bring a sleeping bag liner. You can get them mega-cheap from Sports Direct and they really give that extra sense of comfort when you are not quite sure if the sheets have been washed.Now, I have never stayed anywhere particularly posh in Morocco, as I\u2019m the type of traveller who actually quite likes slumming it a little, plus the more money I save on accommodation, the more I can spend on other (probably unnecessary) things. But I firmly believe you will have a nicer experience staying in a hostel-style riad in the old city (the Medina), rather than a posh hotel in the new city. If you are not the hostel type, you can still find riads for a very cheap price. I wouldn\u2019t pay more than \u00a315/pp per night at most, but the hostels are easily a third of that price.Just read the reviews on hostelworld.com and you should be able to pick something suitable. They usually have lots of private rooms for a low price, too. We stayed at Hostel Riad Marrakech Rouge and I thought it was really good value for money, and even included breakfast. It\u2019s also very centrally located and easy to find from the main square, Jemaa El-Fnaa.7. Have extra space in your luggage\u2026\u2026because you will want to buy stuff! A lot of stuff. Stuff you don\u2019t really need, or rather, never realised you needed desperately right until this moment. On my last trip, myself and my friend Valentina somehow managed to walk up to a lady selling beanie hats, just to look, and walked away with eight. Eight hats!! Three of them she just gave to us for free, because we clearly failed to haggle as hard as we should have done. (My beanie has come in useful lately though, after London plunged into subarctic conditions.)\u201cBut hats don\u2019t take up that much space in your luggage,\u201d you laugh\u2026Well, I also felt compelled to buy a framed painting for my flat, and something I can only describe as a Jedi cloak as a present for a friend. Which he loved, to be fair. Last time I went I came back with a Moroccan teapot and six tea glasses, following some epic haggling where I told the vendor I was a poor Bulgarian student. I even put on an accent, and all!8. Travel outside MarrakeshThere is so much to explore! I have been to Morocco three times, and each time I discovered new adventures. The first time I went with two friends to try out surfing near Agadir, and then visited Marrakesh for the first time. I actually covered this in a different blog (a loooong time ago), so if you want to give this a read here is the link.The second time a group of us went to conquer Mount Toubkal \u2013 the highest peak in North Africa at 4,167m. We succeeded, but we were comically unprepared for the adventure, having only brought a printed version of someone else\u2019s blog to guide us up the mountain. No guides. No map. No compass. And only a couple functioning head torches between nine of us, which came in rather useful when we got lost in the dark on the trek back down, having completely mistimed the whole descent!9. And at the end of it all\u2026have a hammam!But I would splash out on a private one, rather than going to a public one. I\u2019ve never actually been to a public one, but the private ones I\u2019ve had are sooooo good! Especially after days of climbing or trekking up and down the Atlas Mountains. Last time we actually had two in one trip!You are best off booking one of these in advance though, especially if you are going during quite a busy season, because we struggled to find one last minute in Marrakesh on our second night. In the end we managed, and I highly recommend the one we went to: Les Bains d\u2019Azahara. It\u2019s very reasonably priced, and though it is a little bit away from the main touristy areas, it is easy to find. The most basic hammam costs 150 dirham (under \u00a311), while a package with an hour-long massage is 400 dirham. It\u2019s super relaxing and really worth it!The only thing I would warn you of, is that however careful you are to ask for the men and women in your group to be be placed in separate rooms, that is very unlikely to happen. Every time I\u2019ve had a hammam in Morocco I\u2019ve ended up in the same room as at least one of my male friends, which means that you are probably going to see a number of your friends sporting very skimpy disposable pants. You could always make a fuss about it, but I chose to just enjoy the hilarity of it. If anything, it will bring you and your friends closer. Or at least give you some good blackmail material!10. Lastly, when you head home, print your Ryanair ticket\u2026don\u2019t rely on your phone!Moroccan airports are some of the few globally where you still cannot simply show a bar code on your phone instead of printing off your ticket. They don\u2019t have the technology yet, I think. Don\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t able to print the return ticket before you get to Morocco though, as there are internet cafes in most places.So on the penultimate day of our latest trip to Morocco, over the New Year\u2019s holiday, we went to an internet cafe to print out our tickets. Imagine our shock when the check-in page told us the flight had already flown?! We looked at the date on the desktop, and with horror realised it said 5 January, not 4 January, as we believed it to be. For a few horrible seconds we genuinely thought we had somehow missed a day?!\u2026..then it turned out the Medieval computer system had the wrong date setting, and the lady manning the store didn\u2019t know how to change it. The check-in page was taking the date from the desktop (for whatever reason), so it wouldn\u2019t let us check in! Eventually though, we managed to print off our tickets using her computer, which didn\u2019t seem to be plagued with this problem.I hope these little pointers help you on your next trip to Morocco. What else would you like me to write about? What destinations are you planning to check out this year? I would love to hear from you!"

But after the second one, I discovered that isn't the problem. So here are the two things I don't like about Marrakesh' Medina:First, all the people trying to make money from you. Blocking the way, trying to get you in their store, putting things in your hands and expecting you to buy it, boys giving you wrong directions only to ask money for giving you the good one and all the other scams people are trying to pull. I was constantly looking out for all of this, so that didn't allow me to really enjoy the old city. But, I read about this before I went so you could say I could have known. Secondly, and I hated this probably the most, my girlfriend just wasn't able to walk though the Medina without being harrassed. She was wearing jeans, a sweater and a jacket (we went in January) but that didn't stop Maroccan men from looking at her like she was naked, constantly asking her to come with them, calling her a lot of names (including 'putain', you look it up) right in her face and behind her back and trying to touch and grab her behind, luckily not with a lot of succes. Me walking next to her seems to make no differece, but I'm glad she didn't went on her own or with her friends. I don't know why men in the Medina are behaving like cavemen who have never seen a women before, especially because west of the Medina, in the new city, there wasn't any of this behaviour. Some positives to end:Try visiting the Madrassa, Maison de Photographie, the two palaces and the burial place next to those palaces. It are very nice places. Last tip: When looking for directions, ask a police agent or ask in a shop. They'll direct you in the right way."

The most amazing places to get the freshest fruit you've every had (just try one of those mandarin oranges = like candy) and an opportunity for a truly amazing experience. The food is wonderful, whether it's real street food or from one of the many many restaurants within the medina. The tagine and couscous are great and I've never had a better piece of lamb anywhere in my life. Perfectly cooked wherever you go. The medina is full of shops and housing with non descript doors some basic and some rather artistic, everywhere you turn. Two days in the medina was more than enough for me. Be careful of the guides (even the professional ones) as they make a TON of money by shuffling you into the various shops where they have existing relationships with the shop owners and make a very healthy commission from them to the tune of between 35% and 50%. They act like they are showing you how things are made, but then you get a hard sell from the shop owner. I suggest shopping on your own so that the stores don't hike the prices way up so that they can pay the hefty commission to the guides. You've been warned and have a wonderful time."

As a result, we bought absolutely nothing. Thankfully, we had previously spent 3 days in Essaouira where one could shop without any hassle whatsoever. In addition, we were able to chose items that were locally sourced rather than mass-produced in China.The narrow passageways would have been intriguing to explore had it not been for the constant flow of motorbikes whizzing past. Not only did we feel fearful at times, the noise was an assault to the ears and fumes an offence to the lungs. Having visited similar busy market areas throughout the world without any of the aforementioned negativities, particularly in the Far East, this was not a worthwhile experience."

Then there are the hords or young men, totally intimidating and disrespectful.

They will shout at you, approach you in a very disrespectful manner, call you names. Marrakech could be such an amazing place, without those men.I have stayed in a riad, right in the heart of the Medina, really amazing and tranquill place, but was so intimidated to leave the place, and every time I had to leave I just felt so unease. You can't drive during the day in the Medina, so you will be dropped off somewhere, nearish your riad, as far as the car can go, and then there will be the people trying to show you the way, get money off you, and just be a nuisance. If you are a woman, this will 100% be a disgusting experience.IF you can look past that, there are such amazing places to be seen in the medina: hidden amazing restaurants, magical riads, rooftop bars, gardens, nice shops.Bus for as long as people of Marrakech believe that tourists are idiots, walking cach machines that you can throw abuse at, the city will be attracting less and less people, and those who do come will not come back. The greediness will not pay back.Medina could be so beautiful, but that would require a differend mindset of the locals towards tourists."

The most beautiful interiors of fine old buildings quietly hide themselves down obscure passage ways, the markets are treasure troves of all sorts of goods and life, there are large pungent tanneries, old palaces, 'delicious' restaurants, beautiful squares, fascinating museums and so much more ... . Loaded donkeys, mopeds, bikes and people thread through each-other down tiny alleys. Watch-out! We liked the people enormously. They will expect 'a tip' if they help you, and us westerners can sometimes feel grieved that it appeared to be offered free in the first place. Its a different culture from ours and after all in their place, with their economy, we might do the same."

I also found that owners were more likely to bargain in fes and the smaller cities within Morocco. So if you are visiting fes or any of the smaller cities do your shopping there and pick up a couple of things from Marrakech Also make sure to have some mint tea on the top of one of the medina rooftops.

The staffs at our hotel told us almost everyone who came back from the night market have the same problem. Once you chose the place to sit down, they don't care anymore. They will serve you things you didn't order and tell you they're just salad. Extremely small portions (4 euros for a salad in a saucer plate!) and because they want customers to stay to make it look like it is a popular place, you have to be really persistent in getting the bill. Be prepared for surprises when you do get the bill and check it carefully. They roughly added 50 dirhams and pretend it was a mathematical mistake. And the food is not tasty at all! It is much advised to go to a proper restaurant, even with tips it could be cheaper than in the medina where there are people constantly harassing you while you eat. Dirty, expensive, dangerous.

I certainly wasn't disappointed that's for sure.It is indeed a maze. A big, bright maze that will tip you drag you into sensory overload within a matter of minutes. Your nose is excited by exotic and tantalising aromas one second and assaulted by some not so nice the next. Your eyes struggle to take in all the colour and movement and your ears are overwhelmed by the sounds of hustle and bustle, people going about their everyday lives and motorcycle drivers screaming at you to get out of the way.There is definitely a lot to see in the markets of the Medina. Be careful though, what at first seems to be local helpfulness is quite possibly going to be someone looking to make a quick buck. Beware of guides! They will offer to guide you to where you are going and tell you they do not want any money for it. When you get to your destination, however, suddenly you are in the midst of a bartering session for how much he should get. We were expecting this and, after reading the Lonely Planet guide, were under the impression that only 10-20DHM would be changing hands. Not the exorbitant 200DHM!!! I wonder what the arabic word for 'fleeced' is? These guides can become a little aggressive if not placated. Try and get your bearings quickly and walk with direction and confidence. You will need to be firm but polite with your 'NO THANK YOU' and do not believe them when they say something is closed. They have many tricks to make you doubt yourself.The stalls in the market are stocked with everything from silver jewellery, spices, shoes and bags to homewares, art and clothing. My suggestion is, if you are wishing to buy things stay away from the stalls close to the square as they seem to be filled mostly with mass produced and touristy items. Venture further into the markets and let yourself get lost. Shops selling similar items are mostly grouped together which makes it easier to compare items. Be prepared to haggle!!!

It is easy to get lost and hard to trust people to guide you to a place you recognize. Our guide even helped us negotiate prices. We were very happy to have him along. The second day we were on our own and and wanted to return to see an older man who carved stucco pieces and none of us ever found him again. The sellers are quite aggressive and it can be overwhelming. They are willing to negotiate but be careful as they will try to convince you to buy multiples. Be strong with your choices and move on. Once you get the hang of bartering you can have a lot of fun. The medina is beautiful and you will see so much that you love if you let yourself. Go with an open mind and enjoy the experience."

It can be nice to explore (a lot to look and take pictures of) but as a solo blonde female traveller I felt extremely exposed and uncomfortable by all people (read men) trying everything to get contact with me on the streets/shops and comments about my looks.One huge advice. DON'T BUY ANY SOUVENIRS IN MARRAKECH! The prices they try ripping tourists of with are crazy high. If you don't have much time in Morocco I recommend you to at least do a day trip to the beautful tourist costal town of Essaouira where shop keepers overal are much friendlier and have better prices (but you still have to haggle the price down).For example in Essaouira I bought a skin wallet (the ones they sell everywhere at touristy places in Morocco) for 35DH, and I'm sure I could have got it even cheaper if I bought more of them. When I asked about the price in Marrakech many shops started with the price 400DH(!!) for the same wallet. I went to 20-30 shops and it was almost impossible to get it cheaper than 100DH. Very exhausting experience. And I would also be very careful buying argan oil in Marrakech, first of all it's expensive and you can't be sure you get the real deal."

They are very polite and very persistent. It's all a game so enjoy yourself. There are various parts that seem to specialise is products. The spice part is amazing. Loved it. The colours are beautiful. You will find a bargain whatever you want. It's just a case of whether your baggage allowance is big enough! Good idea to take a tour first to get an overall idea. Don't get run over by the bikes and carts that push their way through. It's fascinating."

Many westerners clearly love the Medina, it is certainly vibrant, lively, full of generally friendly people and like stepping back into history but...I am so glad most of the world has moved on. It is also dusty, noisy, exceptionally polluted and also plagued by by beggars and persistently annoying people who want to be guide. The air quality in the cramped streets from the many mopeds is probably the worst I have ever experienced, worse that Beijing, worse even than Delhi. We got lost as so many people do, shopkeepers were helpful but there were also people loitering around that deliberately send you in the wrong direction so persistent and annoying young men can try to guide you and exhort money from you.If you do not like noise, extremely dirty air and large numbers of unpleasant people but still want a feel for the place put on the DVD of the \"Life of Brian\", your lungs will thank you for it."

We stayed in the Medina because it is easy to get to all the main attractions from here but if you are staying elsewhere the Medina itself is worth a visit. There are a number of colourful shops, those selling the usual tourist wares as well as the 'everyday' shops such as the butchers, barbers and grocers. There is a real buzz about the place ... Stroll around, stop for a coffee or if you are hungry get kebabs from the excellent street cafes (if you want a good view try the top floor of the Kasbah cafe). I prefer shopping here to the souks... There isn't the huge variety but you can take your time browsing and there are still bargains to be had."

You have a Jewish quarter, and universities and shops for local goods as well as giant spice markets. And more places to eat than you can count.If you don't have a guide you will get lost. But it is really very safe. The biggest risk you have is deciding you have to buy something to take home and a local merchant will out-negotiate you. But you will have something to forever remember Marrakech.We hired a guide and actually bought all the light fixtures for a house we were building, as well as several rugs from a wholesale merchant. All is either from inventory or made to order and being shipped to us in the USA. If you like Moroccan design you'll never have a better opportunity to buy than here.For food there are restaurants, but there is also a large plaza where the open air shops serve everything from snails to lamb brains -- so if you are really an adventurous eater this place cannot be beat. But, of course there are far more normal foods to be had as well.The spices here cannot be beat. The spice market stretches an area larger than most supermarkets. Again, decide before buying if you are looking for fun or really want to spend money. You can buy real Moroccan saffron for 1/10th the price of anywhere else, or all kinds of the very best spices. Again, if unsure hire a guide because like anything the best stuff costs more but you have to find merchants that cater to the market (and the really good stuff you don't negotiate on the street, but rather in their back shops - and actually if you are reputable and they are reputable the prices are not negotiated on the best spices. But they are far cheaper and better than anything in the USA.)You will be shocked at the size, variety and shear learning opportunities in the Medina. To miss it is to miss Marrakech."

I did my research before going to Morocco, I read a lot but, to be honest, it wasn't as scary as people described it. Yes, the vendors are kind of aggressive, but they're not THAT bad. Some of the souks are quite OK, the sellers ignored us and let us have a good look at the products before actually buying something. We didn't use the navigator because we simply did not get lost. The Medina is spider-web-shaped, so whichever street you go to, you will at some point end up in the main square. As long as you mind your own business, avoid eye contact and just enjoy the view, you will be ignored. If you feel adventurous and want to interact with the snake charmers or with the other entertainers, negotiate the price BEFORE, not after taking pictures. They're quite sensitive about taking pictures, so respect their privacy and play by their rules. Friendly advice: avoid the place where they park the carriages. The horse smell in day heat is unbearable. Other than that, enjoy the experience, you'll never forget it. I'll definitely won't. PS: I traveled with my husband, no guide, just the two of us.

I went once before in 2007, but I guess I was too young to remember how horrible it was. I was so excited to be there, walking through town, enjoying the great colours and products and I was keen to take pictures of the locals and their products. It's a different reality though. As soon as you set foot there, be prepared to be harassed by hustlers. They just cannot let you pass without annoying you with their products. Be very careful when taking pictures, as they would expect you to pay them! People are very keen to offer 'help', but nothing is free - once they see you are a tourist and trying to find your way, they will immediately come and offer 'help', and they expect a lot of money in the end. Also, be careful of young boys who lie to tell you that 'the road is closed', and they will take you round a longer way and then ask for a lot of money in return! You are less likely to get harassed in town though, as most of the hustlers agglomerate around the souk and Jema el Fna area. Be careful of mopeds and bicycles in the tiny alleys as well, as they don't care about pedestrians and are unapologetic as they whizz around. There are some tiny gems if you walk around, especially restaurants tucked away in little corners. This has been a general experience in Marrakech."

Prices vastly over inflated for tourists but if you are happy to haggle reductions are achievable. The hoped for experience of a relaxing wander through stalls is constantly interupted by the bizarre experience of motor bikes racing through in both directions in a tiny space. You have to be constantly ready to jump out of the way which takes a bit of getting used to. Some parts have signs prohibiting bikes but this is ignored.

Have a cup of sweet mint tea at the top of one of the buildings overlooking the square (probably don't eat) and take in it all. enjoy."

If you want to experience the food go ahead but you can't relax as it is noisy. If you happen to be sitting where you are facing passing crowds you will get people trying to sell you stuff.The one stall where we tried food (117) had very average food. I would imagine they are all the same but didn't try any others so cannot confirm.I would recommend going to one of the surrounding restaurants for a more tranquil experience.I also found walking round the food stalls a bit annoying after a while. Somehow the restaurant workers clocked on we were British and made all sorts of comments in 'British' accents. 'See you later Alligator', 'cheaper than morrisons', etc. I would have preferred to be left alone and see the great food stalls, but people try and pull you in all directions.Still one to see when in Marrakesh."

Markets everywhere in the main square and up the side street, you can watch them at work making leather shoes, bags, jackets, wood carvings, silk scarf. Some beautiful things. The side streets around the souks are very tiny and motorbikes go through so be careful when waking round. The main square has lots of food stalls and shopping. You can really haggle down we got people from 600 dinah to 100 so think what u want to pay and stick to it. There are lots of people with monkeys, snakes music and dancing but be careful taking pictures they will expect a tip. We watch the sunset set across the square itv was beautiful. There is a bar that has a roof terrace well worth a visit as you get the best view. Brilliant place a tick in the box."

People were shoving menus in our faces and blocking our paths to get us in the stores - which was off-putting.We went there again in the following morning and it was less crowded but also less stores (but that could be because that was a Sunday). No offence intended, but I felt it was easier to build a rapport with the older merchants and negotiate in a friendly manner, with the younger ones I felt like their flirtatious approach and cornering you was not cool and made me less likely to buy from them (they didn't like to negotiate too but that could be because they are not the store owners...who knows...)The horse carriages look cool but it did not smell nice - holding our breaths waiting for the cab.Having said that, I think the square and the souks are the heart of Marrakech and would recommend to visit. Better with a large group for safety and to help haggle."

The stall we ate at (Chez Simo) served nice hot food at a reasonable price and apparently Rick Stein had eaten there and loved the food; they had photos to prove it! :)There's a couple of disturbing things going on like monkeys on collars and leads being paraded about and then being kept in teeny tiny cages, but we just stayed away. In the day it's less engaging, it's just full of people trying to sell you stuff. As you'd expect I suppose. But you have to develop the ability to politely and firmly say no and most traders are pretty good about it. Spend some taking to the traders though and you won't regret it. They're mostly very charming and interested in actually talking to you as well trying to sell you something. You'll learn a lot more about marrakech that way. All in all I'd say it's worth a visit in both the day time and the night time as you get to see both sides of life; during the day - the echoes of the call to prayer and the tang of freshly squeezed orange juice; during the night - the smells of grilled lamb and vegetables, the shouts of the food stall holders and the impromptu drummers and musicians."

Most median have streets designed several hundred years ago to walk or if you were rich, ride a donkey through. As such, they have narrow winding streets (alleyways really) that invite you to discover what is around the next corner. In Marrakesh, the streets are a bit wider than other Moroccan city Medians which has encouraged the local population to ride motorbikes in the Medina at top speed. As such what is generally around the next corner is a motorbike ready to run you over. Also, with Marrakesh a very popular tourist destination, the shops are numerous. In general they sale mostly Moroccan made products, but be prepared to bargain hard. The Medina in Fez and Meknes were much more enjoyable, slower paced, and all the shopping, local color and history you could want. They do not have, however the central plaza with it's snake charmers and Orange Juice stands that Marrakesh has."

I liked heading south and to the east (not as far as the infamous Tanneries) where the relentless pestering to buy look, stop etc eased off, In one part I passed a number of workshops where they appeared to be making some of the metal, wood and artefacts they sell in the shops, Ok you still needed to look confident even when you were lost but occasional directions did not come with a request for a tip but were given freely and pleasantly. There was one little place where an old guy appeared to have his 'studio' and his paintings were from the naive school of art but he gave me directions from his hovel and I wish I had tipped him. There were lots of alleyways and deadends with garages being used by busy work people and donkey carts, a lot of work took place on the street etc. I went down one particularly busy road of garages only to find it was actually a dead end - walked back with purpose. There were a few cafes etc as you wandered around but nothing much that I saw. However it made a nice change from the frenzy and hassle of the souk area and it was nice to see local people in their milieu. I would recommend it if you don't mind walking and getting a bit lost for a while."

However, it can be overwhelming so if you are staying nearby, it is important to take breaks from the craziness either from a rooftop cafe or even in your room. Definitely watch your wallet as my husband was nearly pick pocketed in the evening while we watched the numerous side shows that go on at Place Jemaa-el-Fna-square. A few tips: Do NOT under any circumstances, let anyone \"guide\" you to where you need to go. Nothing is free in Marrakech and \"helpful\" people will expect a payout of $5-$10 or they can get nasty. Don't ever ask for directions. Take your map(s) and figure it out or you will have to pay someone who offers \"help\".Wait at least 2-3 days before you buy anything. I promise, you will see the blouse you love at 5 other places for 5 different prices and you have to give yourself a day or two to learn how to bargain. Start by cutting the price at least by half.Prepare yourself to be hounded every two steps for good or services. There were days I wanted to scream.Take time away from the craziness. Spent a few extra minute sitting in a garden or having a coffee away from the crowds. It will help your sanity. Finally - Enjoy - It is truly an amazing experience!"

And the merchants will tell you to come in to their shops \"just to look\" and you will be stuck because of the salesmanship and genuinely welcoming attitude. You may be offered tea. It will really be hard to refuse, so prepare yourselves. The Medina is a sensory bomb. Every alley smells different, some wonderful with spices, some barfy with leather tanning. Lots of colors and sounds and people. People walking. People on bikes. People on mopeds. A lot of people on mopeds. Somehow the chaos works. The Medina is laid out in perfect square blocks, all bright and streets well marked. I'm kidding; it's an labyrinthine and nearly anonymous system. You will get lost. Accept it. It's just part of the experience. Folks are very helpful and you'll eventually find your way out, theoretically. There are many restaurants and \"bars\" scattered about. It's fun to take a seat and watch the crowd. I put bars in quotes because, as far as I could tell, no one actually serves alcohol, though they all advertise mixed drinks. Also, don't take a picture of people unless you ask permission. We learned this the hard way after being pelted by small rocks thrown from the hands of several 8-10 year olds. If somebody does come up to you, perhaps dressed in traditional Berber clothing or holding a snake, and you take a picture with them or of them? You will have to pay them. It's fun. Lots of people. Generally very safe (watch for pickpockets), and a hoot.Now, go get lost."

You will find an array of souks selling spices, olives, traditional clothing, footwear and lots of specially hand crafted goods. The street vendors have food stalls which are a real hive of activity at night. You can pick any of them for a similar dining experience. They will all reach out to you as you walk past and whilst they may come across pushy.. it's all good fun.. just smile and keep walking if you're not looking to eat. The medina gets packed at night with tourists. As usual. Just be mindful of your belongs and you will be fine. It is a safe place to go and is frequented by families. Always barter with the shop keepers.. it's the done thing. Morrocons are nice people in all.. just be friendly and upbeat and play the game. Don't feel like you're being conned. They're competing for income like anywhere else. The snake charmers will approach you if you look too hard or take pictures.. of course if you want to see the show.. stick around. As is also the case with monkey handlers.. just be politely adamant and say no with a smile and keep walking by. Again.. if you want to have the monkey on your shoulder.. stick around. The name of the main square is jemaa el efna. Any taxi will know how to get there.. but make sure you agree the fare before getting into the cab. It is a good idea to ask your hotel staff what a reasonable fare is. 30-40 dirhams on average. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and for 4 dirhams it's silly not to try it. Stick to bottled mineral water. As for food, the foodstalls have a huge variety from grilled meat to seafood and tajine. To be honest, they're all the same taste wise and price and from my experience.. fairly safe to eat from. In summary, the medina is a vibrant and colourful place which really comes alive at night. Just show due care and be alert and you will have a special time in a very special place. I highly recommend going. (I normally hate crowded places)"

The Medina of Marrakech is the most amazing labyrinth made easier if you have a copy of Souk Facil', and while this doesn't guarantee you will find your way around it does help in locating specific sights. The stallholders touting for business can be irritating if you let them, however by just accepting that's how it is can make the experience easier. There are signs and eventually you will find your way to the Jemaa el Fna regardless of how lost you seem."

The Medina of Marrakech was one of those experiences that I have wanted to have for several years, especially after hearing so many interesting things about it! However, I was disappointed. I imaged 25-30 years ago, this place would have been an amazing experience, but there are other places in the world where you can eat street food, get hassled to buy poor goods and be entertained (and ripped off) by dancing monkeys and snake charmers. I decided to visit the Medina twice during my stay, just in case, I had got it wrong the first time, but sadly, I was right. Over-rated, predictable, and a real let down. Sadly, the power of money, and not one of promoting their wonderful culture, food and history is the real driver these days."

The rules:-try to look as little like a tourist as possible. No maps. Keep your camera hidden. You're less likely to be jumped on. - develop a \"come near and I'll kill you\" look. - look like you know where you're going. - know you'll get lost. Just go with the flow. You'll pop out somewhere soon. Don't EVER ask for directions. You'll be lead to a shop who will pressurise you to buy. - keep walking. - don't follow anyone's instructions - ignore the people who try to get your attention- don't take your phone or wallet. Keep your cash hidden. Then you won't worry about being pick pocketed. - drink the orange juice and try the snail soup- know you'll probably get the squits afterwards but don't worry. It'll go- stay well clear of anyone with a snake, monkey or playing an Instrument- enjoy!!!"

From the motorcycles, bikes and donkey carts trying to squeeze their way down the narrow packed alleyways to the hustle and bustle of the Souks and the main El Fna Square, the Medina is a fusion of sounds, smells and colours. At night the square comes alive with the many food stalls all vying for your business. We found that by rubbing our bellies and saying \"Already eaten\" & they would say \"you come back tomorrow?\"We found the souks a lot of fun and were persistently pursued by shopkeepers trying to haggle to make the sale. Again, we felt it worked by having some Dirham in your pocket & saying that this was our last day and that this was all we had left. One did try to barter for my watch and my phone, but when he realised I was not budging, reluctantly agreed to sell a pair of leather Baboosh slippers for 100 Dirham (originally 600 Dirham).You can get a little disoriented wandering the Medina and either a map or Google Maps on your phone is a great help. You will be bombarded by people trying to \"help you, no money, no money\" but we smiled & walked on and eventually they got the message.Personally, I found the Medina a safe place and enjoyed the hustle and bustle and would recommend it to anyone visiting Marrakech for the experience"

It definitely provides stimulation to all of the senses and there are great bargains to be had. When walking into the medina people will try and engaging you... keep walking and touch nothing. Touching means that you are engaging and engaging can mean parting with money! When you go dress appropriately, you will be respected as a woman for covering your head and not wearing short shorts! Cover your arms and legs. This is bargaining heaven, never accept the first price I would always offer 25% - 33% of what was offered and work from there knowing that I was aiming for at a maximum half of the price offered. Also don't be afraid to walk away there are so many people selling here. Its a great place to get leather goods and you can really get a bargain. Also be careful of people who want to guide you through the souk, they will expect payment and will take you to store holders that they get a kick back from. Also be aware of where you are walking and take note, this is a place where you can easily get lost because there are so many nooks and crannies. Watch out because in Marrakech anything and everything in on the road and going through the souke. We experienced motorbikes, bicycles and donkeys through the narrow walk ways. If you are going to Marrakech definitely go here it is a great experience."

It can feel a little intimidating at first but you just need to be friendly and firm with everyone who wants to be your friend and maintain a healthy scepticism about motives! Bartering is aggressive and with some persistence and a little 'walking away' and indifference the prices can drop up to 70% from the original. It's part of the fun but remember to leave stallholders with some profit & pride. The mopeds buzzing through the streets can be dangerous so keep eyes open and ears alert. There are also no street names so keep the square, which is signposted, as a point of reference, if you ask directions be prepared to be shown your way and then asked for money."

There is an area for food - dead and alive, leather goods, woolen goods, carvings, clothing, jewelry, household items, etc. I have to say that the store owners are certainly not as obnoxious and pushy as the ones in the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul. When I politely said no, they basically left me alone. There are lots of interesting things to buy, however, I have downsized so I don't need anything."

We ventured there just before sunset and felt the transition from loud and busy daytime market to an even louder and busier evening extravaganza. The narrow streets through the Medina are lined with many merchants, most of them friendly enough as long as you understand it is their job to try to sell you their stuff. Haggle if you wish, only buy what you want, and a polite no thank you will suffice most times if you don't want to buy. The wide open plaza is great for people watching. As it gets closer to sunset, there are snake charmers and the mesmerizing sound of the oboe like instruments. There are also monkeys doing tricks. There are also story tellers surrounded by crowds listening in and laughing. I don't know Arabic, so had no Idea what the stories were, but judging by the size of the crowds, they must have been good.If you stop to look at monkeys, snakes or story tellers, you will be pressured to pay, but so what. This is how they make a living. Our guides helped us know what a fair tip was, so we carried small Dirhams for that purpose. The food booths that set up later in the afternoon are dazzling. Many open fires and lots of smoke. We weren't hungry and had dinner planned with our group, but all of the food was inviting, and the smells were both bad (the smoke) and terrific (the spicy food).Let yourself loose, take the ordinary precautions, know what a fair tip is, then venture forth."

Open your mind, forget your preconceptions and engage with the people! You don't need a guide; you may get lost in the Souks but that's part of the fun and you'll find your way out eventually! Haggle for everything. Aim for half of the asking price or lower. Don't be scared to walk away - they'll chase you down the street if they want to sell! If you aren't interested a polite \"no thank you\" is good enough. The main square has a life of its own! Find a caf\u00e9 with a balcony to people watch! You'll see snake charmers and monkeys on chains (neither of which I approved of!) and if you stop the men will try to get money off you. At the end of the day, you watching is their livelihood, so if you don't want to pay, don't look! Other than that, there are numerous market stalls selling everything from old dentures to argon oil! Haggle away, and make sure you have a refreshing fresh orange juice from one of the many stalls. As evening approaches the square takes on a different feel as the food stalls open up and the entertainment changes. The food stalls are a must to walk through, even if you've eaten! The owners all speak to you in out of place English phrases to get you to look at what they have! Interact with these people, it's great fun!

On the other hand if you want to buy! be prepared to haggle \"it's good fun and expected\" if your careful there are some great bargains.Be aware that it's common practice to ride scooters through crowded passages but it all adds to the experience. We went late afternoon in the daylight and stayed until around 8pm \"dark\" the whole place transforms. There are hundreds of people, the atmosphere is electric, especially with the snake charmers and monkeys. All of which provide entertainment \"at a cost\" Getting lost: be aware it's a labyrinth of passages, should you get lost avoid the volunteer guide it will likely cost money...We took a few precautions before going, keeping monies and other items secure. No point in becoming a victim.The whole visit was like stepping back in time but a superb experience and one i would highly recommend"

Overall we like the medina of Marrakech but the worst part is the running of motorscooters through the narrowest of passages upsetting the experience of pedestrians. Can understand that some residents find motorscooters a convenience and perhaps a necessity, but that is no excuse for them to intimidate pedestrians and speed through narrow passages. Some of the scooter drivers are more patient but too many are impatient and disturb pedestrians and speed. Perhaps motorscooter drivers should be made to walk their scooters through passages at the same speed as pedestrians and only ride them in designated wide passages and streets. We found that taxis in Fes and Meknes always used their meters but found the use of meters spotty in Casablanca and had worst experience in Marrakech. That might reflect on the local officials. Do not expect to see much of real craftsmen at work in their shops. You will see more of that in the medinas of Fes and Meknes. Would rate Marrakech medina higher if it were not for the scooter problem."

Inside the winding streets are humming with activity. Be careful walking around. Cars, scooters, mopeds, donkey carts, bicycles and people all compete for the road, sometimes with no seeming rhyme or reason. But surprisingly, we never saw one crash, although we constantly expected to. Walk the streets away from the Jemaa. The areas where people live are fascinating. Long, narrow roads lined with high walls and fanciful doors, which open to courtyards that in turn open to the sky. Because of the heat there are very few windows to the outside. But many places have rooftop gardens. The Medina covers a large area and each section has a different character. Worth checking out the southern quadrant, which holds the Jewish Quarter, and the palaces, and the north end, which has a totally different feel."

The medina is little preserved compared to Fez or Meknes; motorbikes are speeding few centimeters from you even in the smallest streets; continuos harrassment from shop owners trying to sell you product made elsewhere in the country at unbelievably high prices. Signs for orientation are deliberatly manipulated or covered to lead you to shops in places away from the main paths, where you would have no interest to end up. Plenty of locals offering their services to \"show you the way\", which actually means long detours you to bring you to their friends shop. Tanneries are very small compared to Fez and even there you are aggressively approached by \"guides\" pushing you to take tours, to eventually bring you to some shop. If Marrakesch is not the only place you will visit in Morocco, its Medina is a location which could be skipped without loosing anything intersting. Have a look at J'maa el Fna square during night time and head somewhere tourists are not seen as an ATM to get money."

As an ethic art collector, our guide knew the artisans and helped us get the best prices on rugs and ceramics. Negotiating is a sport for Moroccans, so don't be afraid to get in on the fun! They've practice the fine art of negotiating for centuries. It you choose to take pictures of the locals or vendors, I would recommend that you ask first and be willing to pay a few coins or euros for their trouble.Our guide got us into an authentic Moroccan restaurant down an alley called Riad Dar Timtam. This was no tourist trap. The meal was outstanding and the other patrons were all Moroccan.The alleys are all very narrow and occupied by pediatrics, vendors, and motor scooters, so be alert and careful of moving vehicles.Morocco depends heavily on tourism, so the people are all very welcoming."

We stayed in the Medina (The excellent Riad Miski) and were thrilled by the experience. Too much to describe, but immerse yourself and enjoy the ride. Start with a mint tea at a terrace and observe. Start exploring little by little, and first get to know your way back to your place from the big square. It is easy to always find your way back to the square and from there back \"home\". Don't forget to visit the square in the evening hours, as it completely transforms from the busy daily hassle into a lovely local environment. I could go on, but ask me for more specific questions.

If this is completely new to you, it could well feel intimidating and even dangerous.. HOWEVER! It really isn't either of these. Plan to get lost! You will, and when you do, it wont worry you. It is an absolute maze however let it draw you in and just follow your senses! My advice would be if you are unsure of where you are but you buy something, that vendor will be more likely to help you out. Avoid just asking anyone as who knows where you'll end up! We found just being friendly and when you're not interested just say - they will respect that. The Medina is an amazing experience so treat it as just that!"

I am currently staying at a not nice riad deep inside the Madina (have been here for 8 days) and dread going out each day. The Madina is huge and almost impossible to not get lost regularly - no signs, just vague landmarks to follow. The souks are super crowded and don't even think of stopping to shop - you will be immediately be beset upon and urged, no, demanded that you buy something. Many young men will sense that you are confused or lost and offer to help you out only to intentionally misdirect you, then suggest that you hire them to fix your problem. There are dead and dying animals everywhere (dogs, cats, donkeys, horses) and unfortunately, equally distressed homeless people on every corner (real homeless and starving people - not Western style semi-homeless) who will be begging for anything. This is a truly awful place and be aware that I am sure that many, and even most of the \"positive\" reviews found here are from people on 2 and 3 day closely controlled \"tours\" (probably staying at the Four Seasons) and totally sheltered from the real Madina.

It's best to do a tour initial - even if briefly. Your hotel can set you up with a local guide which will take you around. Be very specific with the guide on what you are interested in as they will normally take you around but to their friends shops first and foremost. Not a bad thing but if you share your interest they are more than happy to give you great input and detail. If you like to do the Medina on your own make sure you have plenty of time, sunscreen and plenty of time. Don't be afraid to ask the locals for directions. And don't forget to haggle haggle haggle."

We went for a walk to see the city. We were immediately bombarded with offers to come and see a shop, go for an excursion, buy some hash and many more. If we showed any interest in anything, we were not allowed to walk away empty handed. This was all down to our attitude and confidence. They could sense that we were out of our depth and comfort zone. We then spent several days touring the country and when we returned to Marrakech for our final 3 days, we had experienced so much in other cities that it became much easier and therefore much more fun to interact with the locals. Bartering for different things became second nature and highly enjoyable. Be prepared to walk away if you don't get the price that you want and don't be afraid to say no. I managed to barter a price from 180Euro down to 25 which goes to show how much they raise the price for foreigners. Tell them their shop is beautiful but you're not interested in buying anything. They loved this and I was able to browse and not feel any pressure to buy a single thing inside. They were just proud that I had complimented their shop and its contents. Give them something (a compliment) and they feel like they owe you something (the chance to walk around their shop, hassle free). It's amazing how we changed our attitude to Marrakech in a matter of 10 days. Marrakech is a fantastic place to visit if you have the right outlook but a nightmare if you're not prepared for it. I love this city and we are already planning a second visit."

The colours and the smells of the spices are absolutely stunning, but I found the most fascinating to be the blacksmiths and metal workers.

Working conditions will give and H&S officers a heart attack, but the results are stunning.

This mosque is the quintessentail monument of Muslim architecture and continues to be one of the landmarks of the current urban landscape today. Some might even call it the Symbol of The City. There is so much to see here in the Medina: the Kasbah, the ramparts, the incredible monumental gates and gardens. You should plan a few days here to see all of the masterpieces of both architecture and art."

They are about a kilometer apart and it is easy to walk or take a taxi from or to them.As flavorless as the new city is the Medina abounds with flavor, charm and color. But these values do not come without a price and the hussle-bussel of the Medina 'streets' crowded with people, motorcycles, bicycles, carts laden with goods and the lack of sidewalks plus the occasional car and taxi make getting around in the Medina a challenge to say the least.But for those who are intrepid or young enough to go hiking or trekking these should be of no concern. For the elderly or infirmed it is not a good idea to venture far into the medina without a strong and capable helper.Registered guides are readily available to act as liason and navigators and for those who are not really fearless it is a good idea to enlist their services.The souk(s) are located in the Medina, as is the Jamaa el fna, the main square.I highly recommend at least spending a couple hours in the Medina where some outstanding Mosques and small museums can be found, as well as just taking in the architecture and watching the daily life of the residents who call the Medina home."

I note this to emphasise there is something special about Marrakech and its Medina. For those overwhelmed easily or claustrophobic then honestly Im not sure it will be the place for you. For those who have a terrible sense of direction stay somewhere like Riad Nashira where a staff member will take you for a free guided walk of the Medina to get your bearings and to show you how to remember how to get home. So what is so special about the Medina - firstly a lot of the craftsmen and women are actually in the medina. Wander the back alleys and you will see them at work. That is pretty rare and really not something you see in the places mentioned above where most of the works are brought in. Also there is so much variety and colour in the Medina. Really the more you explore the more you will find. Get off the main streets and head down some of the side alleys you will find amazing leather and wood products. Dont forget to start the bargaining at at least half the price. You will work out quickly by wandering around (and eaves dropping on other people haggling) whereabouts the price should be. Our advice would be wander - take in the atmosphere, do a mental list of some of the things you may like, speak to your Riad and find out what is genuine and if unsure get a walking guide. However, dont be too timid or scared you will bring back wonderful things. We met a couple who were in Marrakech sourcing products for their shop in Australia and were truly stunned at the prices they could onsell some of the products for. I note this only to say - buy it with the locals in Marrakech dont go home and look to buy something like it."

But if you stay patient, watchful and a bit arrogant, the medina is a really interesting place for aimless roaming and soaking the special atmosphere.

I'd say the Medina is somewhat similar to parts of Istanbul, but not as clean or charming. I didn't find the architecture to be particularly inspiring, and the narrow windings streets were often not narrow enough to prevent legions of buzzing motorcyclists almost taking your arm off. It is definitely an experience, and often a very good one, but it can get mentally tiring having your spatial awareness turned up to max all the time. Which is why so many Riads get such good reviews in this city: look for how many reviews describe them as 'an Oasis' or similar. It's because the Medina is so mentally tiring, that anywhere that offers an escape from that automatically becomes welcome.If you're thinking about a trip to Marrakech, think carefully about what you personally like and dislike, and see if it matches up.

When you enter the square beware of the very pungent smell from the horses pulling the carriages. As you enter the main part you are surrounded by groups of men either playing card games like ' chase the lady' of snake charmers who will put a snake on you and demand a photo in exchange for payment.Going around the souk is like running the gauntlet if you are not used to it, so be prepared to be hassled to ' just look inside 'at ' Adsa Price ' goods.We were told by a very polite man thar the Berbers were visiting for one day to show their wares and told us which direction, minutes after setting off he appeared and said if we were having trouble finding it his friend who just happened to be passing would show us, this turned into a ploy to show us the tannery then into a shop where we were expected to buy something, we politely gave him a small tip and left, so be on your guard. The evenings are better very colourful and very noisy, a good view can be had from one of the roof top terraces for the price of a drink ' compulsory ' at the tup of the stairs, in all am experience, but one I personally would not need to repeat."

My husband did an initial visit on our second day with our oldest son (10) to get his bearings, know where the shuttle stopped etc. a couple of days later, I joined them with our younger son (7). We went around 6 o'clock so it would be a little cooler (once inside the main medina (walled area) within the main square, it is covered so much cooler. It can be quite daunting for younger children because it's busy, noisy with lots going on. There are snake charmers, holy men, monkeys wearing nappies and footy kits. Be careful not to take pictures as the handlers will badger you for money. There are also lots of ladies offering henna tattoos. I declined but one lady grabbed my hand as I walked passed and started drawing on my hand. The children were fascinated so I let her carry on and had to pay her what I thought it was worth (10 dirhams my not impressed husband had to hand over as he had nothing smaller!). As nice as the tattoo was, not a good idea if you have to hold on to a child's hand. That said, it takes 10 minutes to dry but it lasted approximately 2 minutes before being smudged by my son so i had to buy some wipes to rub it off (and from my sons hand) as well as the annoying glitter they also sprinkle on!!! there are hundreds of shops and stalls. The vendors try to get you to come in but a polite no thank you is all you need if you're not interested. I certainly didn't feel hassled and despite my reservations, enjoyed the experience of watching my husband barter for 'genuine fakes!' as the vendors called them. When we came out of the medina (8.30pm) all I could say was 'wow!'. The square was packed, lots of people everywhere, loud morrocan music, wonderful smells coming from the food stalls-it really came alive. The smell of horse poop when you walk passed the horse and carriages (for rides around the town), was quite overwhelming so hold your breath. There are elderly people and mothers with newborns begging for money which can be upsetting but as long as you keep you children held tight, you should enjoy this experience. We ended up going 4 times in total (my husband is a shopaholic!) so it can't be that bad!!"

Every male will offer themselves as a guide for a price, but equally, every stall holder will also shout after you to come in. It gets really tedious negotiating your way around the Medina, it's impossible to ask for directions as everyone wants to be paid, and the piles of tat start to look very tawdry after a while. It's pretty depressing. I'm quite used to being alone but I won't be coming back,here alone again. It's actually quite boring unless you're on a mission to bargain for Moroccan souvenirs all day.

Most of them speak English very well and if you know French wholla. You need to be very good at negotiation and you will be a winner with things. The best thing is to go as deep as far inside the Sammarine - the long street on the left side behind Jama al Fnaa square and when youve reached like half way through, start going in the small allies and you will find treasures on very good prices. Have a good orange juice at the square but be very selective of what you eat as the restaurants around here are not so good and value for money."

The noise, smells, the completely different way of life, the food, street performers, and just sitting in a cafe watching the world go by.This is a definite 'To Do' visiting Marrakech. It's not going to be for everyone as it can be intimidating and some people might be put off by the hustle and bustle, but we spent pretty much half a day there, avoiding any of the 'mishaps' mentioned in other reviews. There are official guides available, but I have no idea where they came from or how much they cost. We just went for it on our own...First off, when arriving in the main square, I'd advise you find a reference point. Somewhere you recognise, and remember which side to exit from again. There are so many different ways in and out it's very easy to exit the wrong way and wonder where exactly in Marrakech you are. For a reference point, choose one of the buildings, and maybe take a picture of it. Choosing one of the street stalls isn't a great idea, as after a few hours they all start to look very similar.... also, they move around, leave, switch spots etc. Secondly, when wandering around the alleys and soukhs, expect to get lost. It'll happen so don't pretend it won't. Don't panic, and as long as you're wandering around the same areas as every other tourist, you'll inevitibly wander back round to somwehere you notice.Everyone there is trying to make money. It's not unknown for a local 'guide' to start walking in front of you, engage in conversation and then pretend to have led you to where you were going anyway. Usually they ask for something for their service, a few loose coins usually keeps them happy and costs virtually nothing. It's actually quite handy as well if, as mentioned before, you do find yourself lost and aren't sure where you're off to...for the sake of 20DH, or less, you can be back on your merry way.BE CAREFUL of any guide who offers to take you to 'leather auction', or a visit/tour or the 'tannery'. I'd read about this in previous reviews, and it almost happened to us. My girlfriend was going around different stalls/shops looking for a leather bag, so the offer of a leather auction made sense. It wasn't until the 'guide' mentioned a tour of the tannery that the penny dropped where we were going. I stopped immediately, thanked the guide, and told him we'd not be going. He knew straight away I'd realised. As previous reviews describe, this 'tannery' is a decent walk away from the main square and soukhs, is off the beaten track, and is a con. You find yourself in an area out of sight of other tourists and when you try to leave you are apparently blocked until you pay something... almost sounded like a calm robbery. I read and, thought it sounded far fetched, then realise how easily I almost walked straight into it myself.SMILE, and a firm but polite 'No thanks' goes a long way. We spent 4 hours in and out of stalls and markets. We only bought from 4 or 5 of them. Every stall owner will try and engage you. They're salesmen and they want a sale, the same the world over. If you don't want something simply thanking them for their 'help', politely declining and walking away usually led to an amicable end to the encounter. We weren't 'abused', or called any names the full day we were there. Of course, some sellers are pushier than other, you simply need to be firmer, just remember to keep smiling, ha ha.If you DO decide to buy something then you're going to need to haggle or be conned. If they offer a price first it'll be WAY over what it's worth. As a rough guide, we never went more than a third or a half of what they asked for to begin with and after totting everything up at the end of the day we'd done well. Be prepared to walk away... if they won't come down, and you think it's too much, just thank them and leave... usually they drop their prices again. They want what's best for them, you want what's best for you. Another trick to try is one I use... I know what I'll pay, so wear a money belt under your t-shirt (makes sense too when you consider pick-pocketting) and only put in your pocket the maximum you're willing to pay. That way when you start bartering you can show your empty pockets and that you have 'no more'. Stops them asking for silly figures too. Henna Ladies in the main square. Be careful not to let them start putting any henna tattoo's on you. Once they start they demand payment, create a scene and can cause some discomfort.... possibly forcing you into paying something. One will approach you showing a book of designs while the other approaches from the other end, trying to take your hand to start drawing. Be careful. The usual 'No thanks', smile and walk away worked fine for us.Musicians/Snake Charmers - When you see these guys, you're probably going to want to take a picture, guess what? Yep... there's someone there asking for money when you've taken a picture of their 'production'.Relax in the cafe's. Down the alley ways and side streets there are plenty of cafe's and restaurants to choose from, usually via a stairway leading you above the alleyways and stalls. I can't comment on any of those as we were too busy shopping and haggling but on return to the main square we were knackered, dehydrated and wanted a seat and a cold drink. We went into the French Cafe (I think it was), and before we knew it had spent around an hour just relaxing in the shade having some water, Coca Cola, and some coffee's, all for about 100DH, while watching the bustling market place.At the end of this it was time to go and meet our transport back to our hotel. I'm definitely glad we did this, and would thoroughly recommend other travellers give it a go as well."

We visited the Marrakech Medina at the end of a two week tripo around Morocco.If we had visited only Marrakech I have no doubt we would have been blown away by the comings and goings here.However, we had been to a number of other Medinas/Souks on our trips and so Marrakech did not compete that well eg especially compared to Fes.There was far too much 'western' goods on sale. There was a lack of small workshops showing people producing goods and services. Instead of just people and mules travelling through there were mopeds and motorised carts / buggies.If you can only see the one then MArrakech is OK. But there are better"

Here life seems more real somehow, everything is played out on the streets here, everything is all mixed in; beautiful doorways with beggars sleeping against them, scooters, donkeys, spices, the souks, the battering, the hassle from stall holders. After the first day i wondered what on earth I'd done booking a week here and thought I would have \\miserable time, then i settled in and very soon became intoxicated with the atmosphere, the sounds, sights and smells, none of which can be conveyed either with words or pictures. I loved getting lost on the souks then after a while realising i actually knew my way round much of them. This doesn't feel like a tourist town, even though of course, much of it is, because daily life mingles with everything else, everything blends in, the locals and the tourists . i would love to go back in the spring or winter too to see how the atmosphere is then as well.Perhaps not for the faint of heart. if you after a relaxing time this is not your place!It was like being in a living theatre, the streets themselves were enough entertainment. Sitting with stall holders, drinking mint tea, discussing family and lives, that was the essence of this place for me.I can't wait to go back!"

This is why you come to Marrakesh, otherwise in the more modern areas you're just experiencing what you do in every city in the modern world.Open your eyes, see the way people live here, their homes, their lifestyle and take part. The Medina is all about the culture of Morocco, it holds the history, the traditions and the way of life within its walls. Sure you'll get lost, it's ok, before you know it you'll see signs that tell you this way to the market (Jamaa El Fna) or that way to other areas. Lots of teenagers and children ask if you're lost and want to be led to particular areas for a small fee. You don't have to partake or use their services, but remember these people are not living a comfortable Western life so they want a fee because this is how they survive. Life is pretty hard but despite this people smile, they welcome you and are proud to share their lifestyle with you. Negotiate the fee before you agree to have someone show you the way - oh they will try to renegotiate once you arrive but just give them the agreed fee, thank them and be on your way.I suggest you stay in a Riad which is a traditional type of accommodation in the Medina. They will provide you with a map to help you navigate your way."

When you expressed no interest in their goods their attitude quickly changes to a somewhat aggressive posture which is highly annoying.The other major disappointment was the presence of seemingly thousand of scooters, motorbikes, mopeds and the like who were constantly racing through the narrow alleyways with no regard to the pedestrian traffic. This is not only dangerous, it adds to the already high levels of air pollution in these confined spaces and does not enable the visitor to in any way relax when you are in constant fear of being run over or run into.I do not know why the authorities do not try and control or restrict this activity."

Morocco was #1 on our bucket list, but after our experience we cannot recommend it as a tourist-friendly place.

Just rows and rows of aggressive locals selling cheap tat to tourists at over inflated prices along narrow streets where you have to also dodge donkeys, motorcycles, cars, vans and push-bikes, none of which have any respect for pedestrians. As another reviewer has said, it is obvious that the sellers are all working together in deceive and relieve you of your hard earned cash. They will constantly tell you that the places you are heading to are 'closed' and divert you to other dubious places such as the 'tanneries' where you'll be shown some rancid dead animal skins and then asked to fork out 100 dirhams to the 'guide' for his 5 minute unintelligible efforts!! I just refused to pay and walked off to shouts of 'you're no good!' - something I became quite used to hearing. Ironic coming from a bunch of nasty, thieving 'no good' conmen. Absolutely horrible place. Even people who pretend to help you have their own agenda. If you take a picture of the snake charmers, they want money. If you take a picture of the street performers, they want money. If you take a picture of someone's shop, they want money. If you are lost and someone offers to point you in the right direction, he'll want money. Do not trust anyone! Then there is the animal cruelty - poor monkeys with chains around their necks, wearing gold outfits and soiled nappies, snakes, donkeys, stray mangey looking cats everywhere. Awful!Then there is the street food. Bland, tasteless and - awful. Just avoid it altogether. They tried to charge us 4 times the amount on the menu for food that was too disgusting to eat and gave us such bad vomiting and diarrhoea, we had to cancel our planned excursion the following day. After that, we only ate at the restaurants and went upstairs where we could eat in peace without being hassled by people trying to sell us knock off mobile phones, watches and.... tissues!And what is it with the tissues? Everyone from kids as young as 4yrs old to grown women trying to sell you packets of handy andies. It's really annoying!My advice is not to go, unless you are some sort of masochist who likes being ripped off and abused on an almost constant basis. I find it hard to believe that the same Brits who hate charity street fundraisers, apparently find this place 'magical'. It's a horrible place full of horrible people so only go if you want a horrible experience."

The Medina in this area is dirty, smelling of urine and is dangerous to cross the roads with motorbikes flying around. On entering the Medina it doesn't really improve, we saw dead rats, dead cats etc. Motorbikes ruled the narrow streets and you had to be very careful. You are constantly harassed by sellers trying to get you into their shops. We are used to going into shops around Europe and having a look at what is on offer, this is not possible here as you will be harassed by aggressive sellers who become rude when you don't buy from them. So for the few days we spent in around the Medina, we didn't buy anything, which is a pity as we ended up buying our presents elsewhere. On every corner there are people telling you this street is closed, or that the main square is closed etc. They try to get you lost and then reappear to help you. They will look for money. They give you the classic line, do not worry I am not a guide, do not believe them they either want money to show you where to go or they want to bring you to certain shops where they will get commission. They again get rude if you refuse their help. As you get closer to the main square, you get harassed and shouted at more and more by the sellers. It is best to ignore them and pretend that you do not speak their language. The main square is more harassment. Again, everyone is looking for money from you. There are no police around and the whole experience can be unnerving. Its certainly an experience, but not one that I think I'd repeat.

If going into the Medina, download the map on Google Maps to your phone beforehand, then using the gps on your function (which doesn't cost money), use that to navigate around the Medina. Otherwise you will be easy prey for those looking to exploit you. Do not trust the shopkeepers who also talk about trying to help you and speaking from the heart, these will soon have you in their shops trying to get you to buy stuff and again they get aggressive if you do not buy. Everyone seems to be working together and working as a team to try to exploit you. Be very careful."

When buying, HAGGLE first at least half of the price. Marrakesh is nice to visit but seriously the haggling business everywhere drains your enthusiasm and energy so keep that in mind. If you are a woman try to dress a bit more appropriate to their culture, even if some will say they are okay with shorts or sleeveless shirts if you can avoid do it. I was with my husband and I was wearing pants and short sleeves shirt but I still get catcalled. If you wanna eat like a local, try the open stalls at the edge of the zouk in the Djemaa el-Fnaa."

It was pretty intense- had we not had a guide with us, we would not have been able to enjoy strolling through the souks unmolested. We went to Dar Mejbar, and spent a couple of hours with Azziz, drinking mint tea and getting a great show of the gorgeous carpets from tribes all over Morocco. We ended up buying quite a few and we are not sorry in the least- no buyers remorse! We also went to a lamp shop (don't remember the name, our guide took us) AND to the fabulous Maison de Caftan- awesome embroidered clothing, d\u00e9j\u00e0 llamas, caftans and velvet jackets. All in all, I like the experience of the Medina in Tangier much better, but Tangier doesn't have the craftspeople that Marrakesh has. Take my advice- get a guide! And enjoy haggling- it's expected- and enjoy the people. They are wonderful when they are not trying to get you to buy their wares. Truly warm and lovely people!"

Never but something from the first vendor. They will try to act like your friend but negotiate a price , then go to one of the other vendors selling the same thing and use the first price as a point of legitimacy to negotiate a fairer price . The census will legitimately charge you 10 times more than something is worth because westerners are not used to negotiating. Most of what they are selling is not valuable and there are lots of vendors selling the exact same things. Good luck and enjoy it."

That was MORE than enough! Firstly we were accosted by multiple \"guides\" wanting to take us to the stalls of his choosing for a small amount of money per person, they are really insistent but as long as you remain firm and say NO they do eventually leave you alone. Be careful to take note of where you are as the place is like a maze and you can very easily get lost. Watch your wallets, bags etc too as we were followed by a very suspicious looking young man who retreated when i made it obvious i knew he was following me. (I had a bag with suncream and water in but he obviously thought i had money etc). It was unbelievably hot (49 degrees!) so it would have perhaps been wiser to go later in the evening. The stalls are all very welcoming but they dont want you to leave unless you've bought something. Aim to pay around a third to maximum of half of whatever price they first ask for and dont be afraid to walk away, they come after you and sell for the lower price 99% of the time. They seem to think its acceptable to grab you to put items and even animals on you for photographs so they can ask to be paid afterwards and some get rather insulted when you say NO but dont let that put you off. The horse and carts are all lined up along the side of the road but the horses are without water in unbearable heat ALL DAY so on principle we would not use them. The horses in some cases even had their front and back legs chained together to restrict their movement, it was horrible to see. There were men with Monkeys chained to them and they would attempt to place these on you for a photograph, again, we refused as we considered this cruel and unnecessary. The Main Square has to be seen to be believed! cars, mopeds, bikes, trucks, horse and carts as well as people everywhere, all going in different directions, all at the same time, you really have to be careful. You cannot go to Marrakech and not go to the Medina but dont wander too far away from the main square, try and stay polite when saying no thank-you and put plenty of suncream on if you go in the daytime. Its absolutely boiling! Much warmer than at the hotel somehow. Having said all the negatives, there are some lovely things to buy as souvenirs or even home decoration and the genuine imitations are a plenty. Just keep your wits about you and be careful not to be killed by a moped."

            "review": "Dreadful cesspit of desperation and degradation. The Medina of Marrakech has a couple of jewels buried deep within it. The problem is twofold: finding them and then making your way over to them unmolested. One of these jewels is the Museum of Marrakech, which contains fascinating exhibits and artwork that has been loaned on occasion to international institutions such as SOAS, and which contains most pleasing architecture and features, with friendly and helpful staff. Here is my story of what happened on the way there. First I was accosted by a young man who appeared insistent on giving me directions despite my protestations I didn't need his help. He then tried to sell me Argan oil (a local snake oil type of cure-all) which I refused. I ignored him, then he tried to close a road to me, saying there was a mosque down that road, that it was time for prayers and that I couldn't head that way because I was a tourist! When I asked him if he was a policeman or guard to close a public right of way, he became furious and violent. A passer-by intervened, and that passer-by then tried to sell me hash. All of this is par for the course in this rotten sewer of a \"tourist destination\". The people in the Medina are seething with greed, dissatisfaction and suppressed jealousy and rage at tourists, while conveniently ignoring that their king has effectively walled off half of the city for his own private use (he has at least 2 palaces in every city). To the locals of the Medina, every tourist, even a student or a backpacker, is fair game to be defrauded or robbed, a fat-cat millionaire who has no right but to be redirected through the souks whenever he or she is on the way to an actual tourist destination of merit, such as a museum or the Jewish graveyard. I have lived in a third world country before, and I recognise well the symptoms of a place run by a mafia. I also recognise well the symptoms of stress, anxiety and bemusement on the faces of tourists. Make the best of it, but you will be accosted and harassed here. If you go to a 'nice' part, for example the kasbah, you will be aggressively redirected to the souks, usually on false pretences, by some random person. This is the work of mafia gangs.Regarding shopping, you should avoid any kind of tourist tat. All the gemstones are plain, worthless quartzes dyed with some chemicals then baked in the oven. That's why their colour is so glaring, and why it doesn't penetrate through the entire geode, and why the exterior of the geode is as black as coal. When you've been through the Medina a few times, you will see that there are one or two shops selling things at fixed prices. Look at these carefully and make a mental note of a guide price before going out to haggle for anything anywhere. For example, one shop sold all leather jackets for a flat rate of 600 dirhams. Anything someone wants to sell or offer to you will be some kind of fraud, so don't go in there trying to buy anything you haven't already researched thoroughly on the internet. Leather goods in the Medina are actually inferior and more expensive, and the sellers far more aggressive and dishonest, than in the markets in Gueliz. Likewise for anything you see in the Medina you might want to buy. Just don't. Go to Gueliz.Unfortunately the Medina looks amazing in photos but is nothing but stress and aggravation when experienced in real life. There is much talk of an invisible tourist police taking control, but absolutely no evidence of this unprovable and unlikely state of affairs. If there was an undercover police force, the locals would know their faces from the first moment they made an arrest. There are no nice people here except maybe the occasional Tuareg. You've been warned. The unpleasantness of the Medina is compounded by the presence of animal cruelty (not just monkey and snake displays but also the slaughter of livestock and chickens), flies, cockroaches and bugs buzzing over foodstuffs such as sweets, and the occasional local relieving himself in full daylight in the corner. It's a pretty foul place. I can imagine it would have been a fantastic place to visit in the 1960s and 1970s, but the world has moved on and now it's just a cesspit of desperation and degradation."

But you need to be very careful and keep your wits about you as money really talks and just taking a picture could cost you! There are snake charmers around that will charge you if you stop to watch or take a picture. There are people with monkeys who try to put the monkey on you for pictures. It's impossible to agree a price first because the monkey is on your shoulder straight away and as soon as it is off the request for money starts! Try to have change or small notes in your pocket as it is difficult to get money out unexpectedly with the men looking into your bag demanding big sums. Give them the small amount in your pocket and tell them it's all you have and walk away. Or keep your distance in the first place! The henna women are also very forceful. I had one grab my hand and start putting henna on me despite my protestations. Be firm, keep walking, avoid eye contact as once they have you their grip is very strong. My friend had to pretty much karate chop the lady off me!! If you want their service, always agree a price first!!! If you eat in a restaurant you will find most are very well priced and you can have a lovely meal for about 50 Dirhams. I would advise you to sit upstairs as not only do you get a fantastic view but if you sit downstairs you are constantly hassled by locals trying to sell you everything from watches and phones to children selling packets of tissues. People also come around playing instruments and doing acrobatics before asking for money. Avoid eye contact. I saw one old man with an instrument spit at an eating couple because they did not give him money!!! Also avoid giving change to the children, encouraging them to approach strangers can only end badly. Be prepared for the many beggars, it's heartbreaking. If you like to haggle the souks are great, like Aladdin's cave. But the first price they give you will be unreasonably high!!! Aim to pay a third of that at an absolute maximum. You can normally haggle a lot lower by walking away. If they let you go you know you have reached the limit of what they will accept! It is better to go when there are more tourists around so the sellers' attention is divided. We went when it was quiet during Ramadan so we received a lot of unwanted attention, especially being two women. Everybody wants Money for something and some of the men are very full on!! Don't be ripped off by taxis either. They should never cost more than 10-20 dirhams for short distance rides during the day. You have to be savvy in the Medina but once you've got the hang of it there truly is a lot to see and it has a strange charm about it that can't be easily described."

The medina is a very busy & noisy place but also very vibrant and colourful. Need to watch out for scooters and taxis which seem to drive in any direction. A great idea is to see the Medina from one of the restaurant/cafe roof terraces. Great view of the Medina & also excellent for taking photos."

Be very careful when purchasing items from the stalls in the market - especially stalls that sell herbs / saffron/ musk / argan oil etc.We visited one of these with a Dutch lady that lives in Marrakech and the owner of the stall explained that they have 2 different types of product - one they sell to the locals and the other to tourists. For example the tourist saffron is made out of the dry stringy bits from the corn cob and dyed red - and they sell it for double the price of the real saffron that they sell to the locals. so you can imagine that all the other 'tourist products' they sell are fakes as well. Buy your Argan oil from a supermarket (like Carrefour) instead - it is cheaper and 100% argan."

Some locals are friendly but others heckle you.Like every place it has bad points and good however it did not live up to its expectations.I wouldn't go back for a week but definitely a long weekend.Be prepared to haggle and have fun with the sellers they are trying to make a living but are friendly when it comes to haggling a price.Do not follow anyone for directions they will either try and charge you and you always end up in a different place to where you want to be!You can't trust many people they are always trying to get money or just screw you over in general.One occasion a man demanded us for money after we said we wouldn't pay him for taking us somewhere. We were in the wrong place and he wanted 500 dirhams we argued and argued and he become verbally and physically aggressive towards me trying to grab me if my boyfriend hadn't been there Im not sure what I would have done!It is a scary place for a female traveller and wouldn't recommend going on your own if you are female.

It has a great selection of products, it is the easiest to get around (assuming you are good with directions). Don't be afraid to get lost... it is one of the best way to find interesting shops and areas. Find some land marks and remember what is around them and if you are lost and stumble across a landmark you can reorient yourself. We did a cooking class at Souk Cuisine on the first day which meant we walked around the Medina with someone that knew what they were doing and we never got lost after that. Not having to worry about where you are allows you to better enjoy where you are now.Lots of good little restaurants and TONS of shops. The only Medina that came close was in Fez."

Beggars, dirt everywhere, men making sex noises in our faces, women touching us, men shouting at my friend that she had a fat behind. We saw 2 black girls frightened- men were spitting at their feet and telling them they are disgusting. Hundreds of men shouting at us to come into their shops- so scary. We went into one shop that looked safe enough with a quiet old man inside but after we both made purchases he grabbed our arms and tried to kiss us. I had to struggle free and just run. A lady offered me henna on my hand and I politely declined( in future don't answer, just ignore and walk on) and she grabbed my hand and started painting it on my hand anyway saying \"just a little flower no money\" then she asked my name and I kept saying no I didn't want the hen but she covered my hand. She then asked for money and I said no I didn't want it but she wouldn't let go. I managed to get away and another woman chased me screaming for money. I told her no and that I did not want it and she shouted \"take it off\" and grabbed my hand and scraped it off with sharp plastic. My hand was red raw with henna smudged all over it. The people here are desperate and it is scary. There is no mystical charm- it is terrifying, mysogynistic and seedy. Avoid at all costs. If you do go do not let the monkeys on chains near you- the trainers put them on your shoulder and take photos then demand a lot of money. The monkeys are also trained to dip into your bags and take your purse. The men everywhere are so vile-'taxi drivers, airport staff, everyone. Western women are dirt on their shoe."

Being a blonde white female I felt very targeted for everything, the women doing henna were so aggressive she told me it was free and then tried to charge 1500 dirhams (it was terrible too) when I refused she grabbed my hand and smudged it before I could get away I was circled by women shouting at me! I got away but was very shaken as it was my first night and was a horrible experience! My advice for anyone especially women is to say no and be very stern about it, I hear there is a henna cafe and I wish I had gone there instead and actually had a pleasant experience and something to show for it! I also got a photo with a snake, he tried to charge 600 dirhams and his friend also ran over with his had trying to get money but luckily we got away with only 100 dirhams! The grande balcone cafe was great and gives you a great view of the square and the koutoubia mosque, they are sneaky too tho they said we could buy ice cream from them down stairs and take it up but when we got the the top made us buy a drink before we could get onto the balcony for 25 dirhams each, when we went to walk away they then let us go through without paying! I was called all sorts of names in the square... Lady gaga, skinny, and all sorts! Funny but quite uncomfortable! Men run after you with monkeys demanding you get a photo only so they can charge you and become extremely aggressive! AVOID HENNA SNAKE AND MONKEY PEOPLE!!! There are about 50 of the same orange juice stalls selling the same thing for the same price my advice is to go to the first one and buy it if you're going to as they are exactly the same only they won't pester you if they see you already have one! I felt after getting a henna as soon as I showed them and said no they left me alone! It's great to experience don't get me wrong but you need to make sure you are strong and say no, I didn't and I almost didn't go back to the medina after the first day! The street food is all the same and all swarmed in flies they do what ever it takes to get you in their stall to eat but we avoided it! They recognised us and every night pestered us and it becomes so annoying (117 takes you to heaven, 118 118) things like thatDefinitely experience the medina but try and be stern about it, many kids came up trying to sell tissues and begging for a sip of my drink I felt incredibly harsh but I always said no, there was one boy that asked for my drink and it was almost finished so i just gave him it but there's girls were standing as I was paying for the orange asking for it!"

A local man, dressed in European dress, approached us and said he would show us the way. He claimed to be one of the security guards at our hotel. He said there was a special rug auction and he would take us to that on the way.Once in there we felt like flies trapped in a spider's web and ended up buying rugs when we had no intention to do so. It was a very hard sell and I did manage to negotiate mine down from \u00a3900 to \u00a3120 and I like it - so no regrets. My friend was not so fortunate - she ended up paying \u00a3300 for her rug (it was a little bigger than mine) but they diddled her on the exchange rate and on the final bill. We emailed them to ask for it to be sorted but no response. So PLEASE AVOID going to PALAIS VIZIR. One of their staff then took us to a shop which was selling overpriced oils and spices - they were 75% more expensive than in the Medina. So AVOID being lured in to expensive shops by local men in European dress who pretend they are from your hotel - this man was not. On my return home I found that my neighbours experienced a virtually identical scenario and we think it was the same man!!On the positive side the Medina itself was very interesting - clean, good value and no hard sell.So to the traders at Palais Vizir and the man that lured us in there if you happen to read this review - you have given your country a bad reputation and you spoilt our holiday by ripping my friend off - shame on you."

This is even more important during the night time and I would suggest not going to stand in within the crowds watching the music / dancing etc as the men we were with had their pockets gone through and the young women were all groped - not a pleasant experience."

Rugs, slippers, headscarves, even sweets are displayed in shop fronts right on the street in myriad colors. Enjoy wandering and looking. To see some local textile action, go to the rug auction at about 5 PM daily except Friday [after prayers] in the rug market next to Rabha Kedima, an open place full of women making baskets and crocheted hats. You can't bid on the rugs yourself, but a dealer can and will get a 10% markup, much less than you would usually pay. My favorite to deal with is Mehdi at shop #48, just inside the entrance to the rug souk and on the left. Though you may not see anything you like at the auction, he can find you any style or size you ask for, borrowing from other shops besides his tiny one if need be. There are also a couple of cafes [with bathrooms] on this square, and a cash machine. But as I said in the title, watch out for those motorbikes while strolling the medina streets. I'm torn between wishing they would be banned and understanding that people living in the medina need them to get to work. Anyone with a creative solution, write to the Tourism Office in Marrakesh!"

The Medina is one of those places you have to visit to see for yourself exactly how busy/crazy but beautiful it actually is!My friend and I visited the Medina as part of a tour we had booked, without the tour I think we would have gotten lost right away through all of the narrow streets and the herds of people! We stopped off in a caf\u00e9 that had an upstairs seating area with a pretty amazing view of the main square (I cannot remember the name of this caf\u00e9/bar but if you manage to come across it, go upstairs and see the view!!) In the main square there are snake charmers and people with monkeys, these people can be very 'pushy' so PLEASE agree on an amount in which you will pay them for a picture with the snakes or monkey. I made the mistake of letting the snake charmer guy free with my camera and he ended up charging me 200 Dirhams, but in all fairness, he took some great photos of the snakes up close! To hold the monkey and to have my picture taken, I gave the guy 50 Dirhams and walked away (I would have given him less but I didn't have any change or anything smaller than a 50) he seemed happy enough.Walking through all the indoor markets can be a little frustrating as you will need to watch where you're stepping due to the paths being a little uneven and then you have shop keepers trying to get you into the shops and stop you but if you say no, they usually just accept that.If you're buying anything, make sure you barter as they usually try to sell you things that are twice as much as they are worth, if you barter right - you can get some pretty good deals! The Medina is definitely worth a visit!!"

Heres a few tips and things you should know before you step inside them walls which will hopefully help you enjoy your Medina experience and also give you more time to do it at your own pace and ul get to see more: \"U Should \"1).Know the exchange rate/money value2). Not buy anything at there first price if you divide it by 3 then haggle,3).be on your guard for pick pockets it might not be a fashion statement but bumbags worn to the front safest way.4).stand your ground and if you dnt want to buy what ther truing to sell just raise your voice when you say N0, theyr are plenty of police inside the Medina and It is against the law to hassle you.NOTE: There products are there only means of living so they will try anything they can to sell them as nobody gets any kind ov help from government.A hard working labourer earns 40p an hr, so dnt be put off with beggars either plz5).keep an eye out for the ladys painting Henna on women tourists they just grab ur arm and start painting you which will cost you big money,if you do want it done do it with brown because black Henna is not real and bad for skin.6) pick out some landmarks if u go inside market it's like a maze and the more you get lost the more hassle ul get to buy things.My first time at Medina was a nightmare, I went again few days later an had the best time ever as i showed i was no push over we were actually having fun haggling with eachother. I hope tips above help you and you's have as good a time I had on 2nd visit.Ther are many places to eat all over the Medina with something for everyone food wise many Thanx Pat.Greene"

Try using a side bag with a zip and wear it in front of you, best way to stay safe and not having anything stolen. Argon Oil - We got told a trick (on our last day which was annoying) and if you shake the argon oil bottle you can tell if its mixed or not if it bubbles up quite a bit it means that its mixed, if not then it should be fine.Henna Ladies - OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM! If you don't want henna, don't feel rude but just don't stop, when they're talking to you, they will grab your hand, start drawing the henna and force you to pay. Its very cheap but thats not the point if you're not wanting henna in the first place and watch your children around them because they may force them. All other products - Try not to buy from the first shop you're looking in, ask for their price, and look around at least 2 other shops, I got ripped off big time! Don't be pressured when they \"last price now now now\" You will find the same product in another little hut. Try not to pick anything up that you don't want because again - they will pressure you.

We saw heart rending scenes of women begging on the street draped in exhausted tiny children; animals on the brink of starvation riddled with disease. Horrific glimpses into butchers shops and the smell of decay everywhere. Add to that some of the locals who seem determined to rinse every tourist and it can get a bit much. We were enticed down side streets by apparently friendly locals offering guidance through the labyrinth of lanes only to find them demanding money with menaces once they got us really lost.

Riad is beautiful, very calming and a peaceful joy to stay in. Very difficult to find until you're used to the wee route out to the roadside. We had read lots on here about Taxi from Airport issues so we booked an online transfer which I paid before we left (by Paypal) cost 9 Euros. Great move as we would NEVER have found the Riad first time. (A member of the Riad staff was waiting at the roadend to lead us! This wasn't part of our transfer - so very good service). I thought that the Taxi back to airport at the end of our trip would be a big Haggle - it wasn't. I asked a Petit Taxi man how much - he said how much you pay - I said 80dh - (just over \u00a35) he said OK - sorted!As you expect here - this place is hussle and bussle and just buzzing with people/mopeds/bikes/cars/donkey carts - thousands of wee souk shops and hidden moments everywhere. You'll get lost but that's the fun of it! We did not get any hassle at all but everyone will be trying to sell you something or get you into their shop/attraction/restaurant it's pretty intense but all part of the great experience.One thing that we couldn't pick up much info on before coming was - alcohol. If you like a beer, wine, spirit then it can be a task. You can not get any alcohol on the main square. You can in restaurants and bars outwith there but its not cheap. I can only go by what we found - but just off the square (down the Rue des Banques - the street down the side of Cafe de France) - is a 3 level bar restaurant called Le Salama where from 16:30 till late they have drinks at 2 for 1 and a bottle of beer is then about \u00a32.Would be nice to see more on here of what other places like that people have found in their expolrations.We had booked a Camel Ride online - great morning out a few miles out of town - 2 hrs on the camels with Mint T and Crepes half way - good fun young guide guys - \u00a324.

It is a beautiful place to hang out, relax - a kind of similar yet very different experience from the beautiful plazas in European cities.At the centre of Medina is the Jemma-el-Fanna or the square, replete with food stalls serving yummy kebabs and seafood fries. The square also houses several shops where you can buy anything from home decor items to prayer mats - all that pretty cheap. Lamb skewers and batter-fried squids top the list of lovely food, spiced up with bread and aubergine paste.Like any traditional Muslim shopping & food district (Jumma Masjid and Chandni Chowk in Delhi), this square also comes to life only from late afternoon - definitely after 5 pm. The food stalls actually buzz with people post 630 or 7...If you don't fancy typical street food, there are a number of nice cafes encircling the Jemma-el-Fanna, with Cafe de France topping the list with lovely continental and authentic Moroccan food. You can simply relax at these cafes and watch the Medina's sea of colour, humanity and activity and have endless cups of Moroccan Mint tea. Emanating from the square, which you can think of as a hub, are several streets which house thousands of small shops straddling together selling anything from ceramic pottery to clothes to spice and olives. The place is a maze and it is easy to get lost in the narrow but very colourful bylanes.In and around the Medina are several historical places too - the Koutobiya Mosque and the Bahia palace being the best of the lot. There is an art gallery and Madrasah too within hopping distance from the Medina.A lovely place to hang out, enjoy, shop and eat - a mix of traditional and modern."

Also in contrast to Fes, there are not many animals nor their droppings, so one can look around rather than at the ground. We enjoyed several strolls through the medina."

Basically everything you must do/see whilst visiting this vibrant city. The souks are definitely the most interesting part but it's so easy to get lost within the hundreds of inter-twinning lanes. We usually like to explore on our own when in a new city but our Riad organised a guide which was great as he led us on a tour of the medina, inc the souks, and told us the interesting history of the city. I had a few bits and pieces I wanted to buy within the souks, so having a guide who knew what areas of the souks would be best, was a massive help. I would definitely recommend a guide for the medina and souks."

Though it seems that many people venture into the medina in Marrakech for the open market and the souks, we decided to stay at a Riad within the old city walls rather than a modern hotel. It was a luxurious experience at the facility, but once you wander out it is nearly impossible to find your way through the labyrinth unless you have a guide or some effective phone app, neither of which we had. You should also be prepared to be hustled by young men telling you \"that street is closed\" and willing to show you the way for a price. The disparate nature of the touristic Riads and the abject poverty and crumbling infrastructure around them is difficult to see, but it's well worth it for a more comprehensive understanding of Marrakech - and if you have the time, an excursion I. To the Atlas Mountains is well worth the price."

We found that the best places to eat were an Italian called I Limoni and the Jemma El Fenna Market (which was also cheap!) 45d between two people. The market is also a must see experience at night. The streets of the medina are a rat run. Make sure you load Google maps on your phone or at least have a map with you, although this may not help you very much as most of the streets are under cover and due to the high buildings you may not be able to locate yourself on the maps too well. You will be inundated with people who will come up to you if you look lost or get your phone out pretending to be 'your friend' or to guide you to a destination. These people will want paying and when you do pay them will always want more. Stand your ground and do not give in. Be firm if you do not want their help. We often had 'guides' waiting on the corner for us even when we had said no and walked off in a random direction to try and shake them off. Be careful when walking the streets as mopeds and scooters as well as cars use the narrow alley ways and don't often stop. The bus to Jemma El Fenna is number 2 and from Jemma El Fenna to the new main part of town is number 1. The airport bus from Jemma El Fenna is number 19."

Just say no to ALL approaches and walk with purpose... although this is difficult while strolling and eyeing the booths. If you would like a guide, hire one through your hotel at an agreed on price. This guide will be your shield for the day against eager volunteer \"guides\" but will likely have some \"cousins\" with shops, etc, etc. It is what it is. One tip I gained (though out in the desert, not in Marrakech) on larger purchases like rugs, leather jackets, etc is always bargain in the local currency (MAD) and make any merchant that quotes you a credit card price in Euros or US Dollars give you a price in MAD. They are looking to add 10% or more in the \"conversion\" if you settle on a Euro or dollar price."

The main square is crowded with snake charmers, henna ladies, watermen and dancing moneys. These poor animals are not treated at all well. I saw them being fed with dry, dirty bread. You can buy dates, spices and nuts at reasonable prices. There are many restaurants around the square where you can go upstairs and enjoy a cold drink while \"people watching\". Through the Medina square you can enter the Souk with row upon row of small shops selling everything from hand made leather sandals, leather coats, carved wooden boxes, carpets and beautiful tagines.......so leave plenty of space in your luggage for your shopping. The shops owners are friendly and expect you to barter in a friendly manner. We made three visits to the Medina and Souk and only met good, friendly local people, willing to give directions when you get lost.

A culture shock but a very positive one. A total immersion and experience for the senses. Sights! Smells! Sounds! Activity! Buzz! Atmosphere! Confusing at first but my experience was that everyone looked out for everyone else. Lost ? Just ask a vendor and they will point you in the right direction. Want to buy something ? Yes ? Be prepared to negotiate. It's the done thing and 99.9% of the time is good fun and done with good humour coming to a win win situation for both parties. Spices, oils, coffee, leather, jewellery, fruits, juices, artisan goods painstakingly made by hand in derbs or lttle alleyways ...local men (usually) hammering out a living. Co-operatives supporting local people the order of the day and therefore one doesn't mind paying a bit over the odds to support the people and economy here. The variety is exceptional. Carts, bicycles, donkeys, people, scooters, cars, small and big taxis....full on but all the more enjoyable for that. By the way small taxis are cheaper and again before you agree to use them you have to haggle on price. Sometimes the taxi driver has to stop en route to ask the way. Interesting approach! And sometimes you are dropped near and not right at the destination and have to work out the rest of the route. You get used to this different way of life and get there in the end. If this is all too much all at once, take time out from the buzz of it all. Sit on the balcony of the Cafe Du France for example and just watch it all happening whilst having a local tagine, just a cafe du lait or preferably traditional Moroccan mint tea. And if you so wish, make a contribution in kind when you are there. Volunteering perhaps at an orphanage or using the restaurant at Amal Women's Training Centre (see separate review).

You will inevitably and inadvertently wander the medina if you have to a) find your riad, or b) go from point A to point B in what you might think is the shortest path to where you need to go. After an hour or so, everything will start to blend in and look the same. Initially you will stumble upon cool shops or places to eat or interesting sites. But the touts who are in your face constantly start wearing on you. You only need to be walking for a few seconds before a tout will identify you as a tourist, and do his best to latch onto you. He'll either you offer you directions or assume you're looking for \"the square\" and try to help. But it's not free. You will surely be hit up for money if you accept directions in any way. Some might even point you the wrong way. The best thing is to use Google maps on your phone to find your way around and retrace your steps using landmarks you passed. I didn't need to have a data connection and Google maps, at least, indicated where I was. With regards to picture taking, be careful who you snap a pic of. I watched tourists get hit up with money or even have their camera looked at and requested deletion of pictures. Not really a fun place to be, in my opinion."

The pace is caotic here inside, lots of people, lots of small stores, lots of people from the area trying to make a living out of the tourists. The center or hart of this jungle, and is a very hot jungle, is the Djamaa el Fna Square, here where most of things happen during the day and specially at night with a lot of attractions of all types. Also has restaurants inside and in all the buildings surrounding the square, some good and some not so much. Beside a city jungle this is also a maze as you can get lost just by taking the wrong turn and believe me, this does happen you wanted or not. If you do speak French, English or Spanish you may find help and in the worst case scenario, have always handy a map of the medina and just point where you want to go. As I said, there are all kind of people making their living out ot tourists so they will, for a very small fee, take you any and every where withing this maze. By the way, make yourself a favor and before you travel here, see here in TripAdvisor what is the best travel agency to make the 2 day/1 night trip to the Sahara Desert or any other trip. What is the best place to get a Sauna and Massage or any other thing you may want. Planning in advance will make your trip and experience more worth wile and time efficient. Good luck"

You can go out on a tour of the spice markets or surrounding Atlas Mountains, visit the locations of films like Babel, Gladiator, Romancing the Stone, Game of Thrones, and see signs pointing south to Timbuktu ( I thought this was an imaginary city but it\u2019s real! ) Visit the women\u2019s co-ops to buy real Argan oil hair and skin products direct from the ladies who make them to fund their daughters education and their own independence. When you are done seeing great locations and laughing Berber ladies wearing their original version of the hijab casually like a Nepalese headscarf, with metal coins on if they are going to town, head back behind the high walls of your Riad to be spoiled like a princess in the cool courtyard. I can really recommend Riad Enija midweek as they are block booked out at weekends by corporates, so firstly it is often empty during the week and secondly 5* for 2 * US/ European prices at that time. You will have the ice cool marble Roman swimming pool and wonderful staff, trees, private terraces and even nightingales all to yourself.

In general the people were respectful to two blondes though the younger boys hanging around would pounce if they saw you consult a map!! we ended up not bothering with the map as when in the souks there are few signs and none that seemed to corelate to what was on the map! You will get lost - many times but it all adds to the experience and you will discover so much but if you see anything you want to buy get it there and then as it's very unlikely you will ever find it again!!! we stayed in Riad in the Medina off Rue El Bacha by the palace and felt supremely safe.

The locals here are used to tourists, and don't feel the need to be overly friendly- but they aren't too bad. Generally if you're friendly and respectful, they will be too. Other than that - its all good. In saying that, medinas in other cities were a little friendlier and more interesting to be honest. Well worth a visit, but don't forget the rest of Morocco.

It offers temperate weather with views of the snow capped Atlas mountains. Magnificent minarets, the call of Islam, and friendly merchants create a nice vibe. Where else does one find snake charmers tempting cobras, fresh sqeezed orange juice venders, delightful Moroccan tagine dinners, and ancient souks selling spices, leather, jewelry, and of course Argan oil products. A trip to the medina from the airport should cost about 100 dirhams. A nice cous cous or Tagine meal about 30 dirhams ($3). Fresh orange juice 4 dirhams. Watch out, if you watch the snakes or play game to their enticings expect to pay; one demaded 400 dirham. Its easy to get lost, figuratively, in the souks, but with thought you can find your way back to the plaza without trouble. Tourists with luggage draw attention from unhelpful guides who hope to earn some money. The best money exchange rates where at the Ali Hotel near the plaza but lots of options are nearby. Consider staying in a Riad for a cozy and more typical experience. If you are shopping for Argan oil, prices vary considerably and may depend on your haggling skills. If prefered, go to a store that sells foods, and they often sell the oil at a fixed rate: 90 dirham for 250 mL or 170 dirham for 500 mL. Leather products also vary in price but consider paying about half the original price: 550 dh for a carry-on sized nice cow leather bag, rather than the 800 to 900 dh they ask. Enjoy!!

They can be very insistent to say the least.Must visit though and take a wander around and see all the areas which make these near-slums exist. A wonderful circus of activity but it can get a bit much/a bit boring after your third time there but definitely worth one meal in one of the overlooking restaurants to watch the action unfold."

It's loosely divided into sections, metal workers, carpet sellers, herb sellers, etc. People will invite you into their shops but not in a hard core way. As you meander about keep your eyes open for cafes tha are located upstairs. It's a break from the hustle bustle and there is typically a shaded patio and views of the city. There are some wonderful cafes with really good food at affordable prices. There were only 2 negatives for me: first was the speed of the motorcycles in the narrow alleys and second was the young men who try to get you to go to the tanneries for spices or whatever. Do not engage them unless you are willing to pay them a fee. Most people will be kind enough to point you in the right direction if you are lost. Almost everyone (except shopkeepers) will not want you to take photos of them. They may get quite angry if you do."

Around the square are lots of low cost decent food eateries. Wandering the alleyways was not that difficult. There are some signs that will help guide you but you can find your way back out of the Souks area if you need to so feel free to wander. I suggest going to what was called the spice market/area. There were several interesting Souks in this area selling more non-touristy artistic stuff. Expect to barter kindly. At night the main square is the attraction. Yeah the carriage area smells like horse pee etc... but that is because there are lots of horses waiting for tourists. Expect to be \"courted\" for your business as you wander the square, as there will be alot of people trying to sell you things but that is just part of the experience. One night in the square is all we needed and did not have desire to return to the square at night but two days wandering the Souks might have been better than the one day we had. Overall I found the Medina to be quite touristy and less authentic than the other medinas in other Moroccan cities."

I found that there is much more variety here. You do have to learn to navigate it though. There are mainly three streets / alleys that run from the Jemma-el-fna Square north: Rue Mouassine, Rue Semarine and Rue Rahba Kdima. The middle ally (Rue Semarine) is the widest and most transited one. While there is plenty to see there, we preferred the side alleys. It seemed to us the quality was higher there. Another general rule of thumb is that the further yo go from the square, the higher the quality. Another tip: always haggle. No matter if you think the first price they gave you was okay, haggle it down. The owners normally do not expect that you will take the first price. Be aware though that if you do begin to haggle it is expected that you will buy the item. That does not mean that if the merchant does not give you a price you feel comfortable with you have to buy it, but rather that if you offer a price and the merchant accepts, it would be rude not to honor it. Last tip I would offer is to dress discretely. While in general the souks are safe, dressing discretely will help keep away unwanted attention to yourself (or as in my case, my wife) during your wanderings around the souks."

However, visiting the Jamaa El-Fna plaza at night was a totally different experience. During the day the locals and even the internal tourists from other Moroccan cities (enjoying the summer school vacation) hide from the extreme August heat, but when night falls they take over the plaza full of food stalls. It is a feast with an unbelievable amount of people. It is safe to walk around and taste so many different types of Moroccan food, or just buy some nuts, olives or dry fruits like figs and dades in very organized and colourful stalls. Outsiders usually enjoy the show from the Cafe Glacier terrace (worthy compulsory minimum consumption of one soft drink)."

There's a bit for everybody within the medina: you have the riads (the nice and the ugly ones), you have the square with it's food stalls, musicians, henna painters and slaved animals, you have the palaces, the museums, the tanneries, the souks. You can spend several days trying to see it all.If you are an organized person, enjoy walking and wake up early in the day it should be enough with 3 days to cover all the major sites.I recommend not having food at the big square as the prices are much higher than in the restaurants a bit further away. We had some excellent sandwiches on food stalls we found in the souk. Also had some lovely stuffed bread (with eggs and olive paste) cooked in a tagine. Would not recommend the fried fish that is sold in the souk as the fish if mostly bones with almost no meet.If you are using a taxi beware of the prices. Ask at your hotel/riad about how much you shold be paying. We paid 30 dirham from the square to the train/bus station (we were asked from 200 to 100 but stay firm as say that you will only pay 30 which is almost double the real price they charge locals). To the airport we paid 100 dirham from the square."

So so SO many horse carriages with the most malnourished, tattered and torn horses. They all carried their heads low, which anyone who knows horses know they shouldn't do that. They line them up, dozens and dozens of harnessed horses along the streets in the blazing sun. Never once did I see them give the horses water. Many of them had blistered and bloody ankles. It was just too much for me. Please do not solicit these carriages! Also, the cats in the town were no better. Many with busted faces, only one eye, if they could even open their eyes from the crust that had built over them. Kittens everywhere. I am an animal lover of course, so this was difficult. It was hard to see passed the animal cruelty to enjoy the actual city. I saw a cage with about 40 Box turtles stacked up inside, I guess for sale? Not sure. Just odd. Marrakesh didn't do it for me. Oh, and the people are not pleasant to be around. I'm not going to elaborate anymore on that to avoid insulting anyone from there, but they were not welcoming or fun to be around."

If I had stayed in my Riad and not ventured out it would have been a really nice break.Copy below......We spent a lot of money coming to Marrakech based on the Tripadvisor top ten 2012 traveller choice cities, which placed Marrakech a spot ahead of Istanbul... but it pales in comparison! The jetset are gone and if there ever was any real glamour so has that! The poverty here is staggering, people harassing, sorry i should say begging you for money constantly... everywhere... it is quite sad... if you are able to look past that then you are confronted with filthy neighbourhood after another, rancid smells, piled up rubbish and an unkept environment all around. Prices are on par with other major cities and if i got what other top cities had to offer then i would not mind paying but i didn't... the locals that do not feel the need to harass you are rather nice, gentle and smiley and easy to comunicate with in various languages.The main square J el and is described in many poetic ways in literature but my take on it is that it could be fun if only the locals allowed you to take it in, but vendors clammer over one another to try to get your attention and if they don't get it it turns ugly, they start insulting you and can turn aggressive, even against one another... lots of brawls... The overwhelming number of motorbikes are dangerour and willing to run you over. The souks could be fun too but should you even dare to glance at any item, again vendors will swoop on you and not let it go... and i do not mean like in Istanbul where they will in fact get the hint and back off, these people do not take no for an answer... Perhaps the saddest part are the animals, monkeys that have had their teeth removed and are viciously reprimanded and choked should they not comply with the onslaught of petting and torture... i am a primatologist and it was evident that they were highly disturbed, but you need not be an expert to notice this... you will see starved donkeys being beaten with thick wooden and metal rods... the ones that could not physically go on got the brunt of the abuse... the horses are generally well fed but again nowhere close to being treated well... the snakes do not have it any better either... sheep seemed to be the healthiest of the animals i came across... the dogs and countless cats all look sick and near death... riddled with parasites... it made my heart sink really! :( Most attractions leave a lot to be desired... poorly maintained and overly hyped up. No real entertainment in terms of theatre or spectacle.It is possible to have a good time, just be ready to spend a lot of money, stick to the top 5*L hotels and spas, sip cocktails, ignore the bills, hire luxury cars to take you past the city walls to Majorelle gardens, Ourika valley, the spectacular Ouzud falls and Richard Branson's gem of a hotel well outside of town and tucked away in the mountains (for \u20ac170 they will send a range rover to whisk you away). But then do you really want to spend that much and get so little? This is the most negative review i have ever written and i am sorry for that but i think it is important that you know this so you can be aware of what to expect; a relic of good days gone by but with some potential still there"

There are people everywhere, rushing about through tiny crowded streets on scooters, donkeys, on foot, carrying huge loads, shouting and calling... There are colours and smells and amazing sights everywhere you look. It simply blew our minds for the first couple of days. Having said that, we got used to it remarkably quickly and generally felt very safe, though we were cautious and didn't carry rucksacks, expensive cameras etc. and always kept our hands on our phones and wallets. You need to be a bit canny and streetwise, and it certainly isn't for the faint hearted. You will undoubtedly get lost, and even the best map won't necessarily help you as road signs are few and far between, and you certainly don't want to get your map out in open view, or you will be assaulted by offers of \"help\" (payment always required). But if you get lost, keep going, look at the suns shadow, and you will eventually come to somewhere you recognise. My advice is; be firm and strong in resisting any offers, keep walking, accept you will be hassled if you stop and look around, accept that you are viewed as a walking cashpoint by all the traders and locals, be prepared to haggle hard, don't be intimidated, and definitely don't go on the back of anyone's scooter who might offer you a lift somewhere .... Sorry to be cynical but it's not genuine, they will ask for money. It's vibrant and thrilling, but after a few days, the constant hassle became quite wearing.... A long weekend will be enough!

Please don't encourage the monkey and snake entertainment - a sorry sight to us these days, also the henna ladies can be very pushy. Having said all that we had some good days wandering round the medina."

Then you get comfortable with it. And finally, you get frustrated with it and want to stay in your Riad. Then you get to a point where you want to go out just to spite people and start to walk with a swagger like you are part of the Medina. At that point you seem to like the place again.It is very tricky to get around. It will really test your navigational abilities. But getting lost will allow you to see something new and interesting. You will be constantly harassed to buy or eat things. Most things to see are in the Medina so you can't avoid going in. Be ready to negotiate or spend way too much on things. It can be fun. Don't take things personally when they sometimes say offensive things during negotiation. It is a game and if you get offended, you will lose. If you don't like bargaining, think of it as a game. Take your feelings out of it. Just a suggestion.After a few days staying in a Riad within the Medina, you start to despise the Medina and certain people inside it. After being told 'This road is closed, it is a dead end, where are you going? I can help you' a hundred times from punk kids knowing very well it is not a dead end and that your Riad is just a couple blocks down that road, you start to despise the young adults of the Medina. Despise them for trying to scam you into going to the tanneries or offering 'help' and then demand 200 dh (about 20 Euros). Despise them for driving obnoxiously fast down narrow roads almost striking old ladies in their stinky, loud, and environmentally very unfriendly motorcycles. Despise them for swearing at you for not following them into their shop or to the tanneries. You will easily despise the young ones, but find a lot of respect for the older generations.So go there, for sure, but limit the time there if you are introverted."

Plenty of folk will tell you which way to go, but their main objective is to lead you to an outlet where they hope to earn some commission and then demand a payment from you for doing so.Signage exists, and is pretty accurate you just have to recognise it as it is usually placed well above your eye-line.Stallholders will pester you if you merely stop to browse.

We were transported to our Riad (Le Rihani) via prior arrangement, which all ran smoothly.When we first went out and about and visited the main square and the souks it was all quite manic with people everywhere. There were pushbikes, mopeds, donkeys, carts and even cars coming at you from all angles down very narrow walkways and in the square for which needed to have our wits about us, however we very quickly got used to this. The locals would constantly ask you to look in their shops but we did not find them aggressive and they generally left you alone if you politely said no. You definitely need to barter over prices. The main square changes throughout the day. The mornings were calm, with the locals setting up their stalls. It got busier throughout the day then in the evening the atmosphere became electric and very busy. The food stalls would be set up with seating and many types of cuisine was available.During the daytime you will see the snake charmers, monkeys and performers. If you don\u2019t approach them they will leave you alone, however be careful when taking photographs as they will ask you for money. Keep at a distance and use your zoom!!We also walked around the Jewish Quarter and the Kasbah, which was also very busy and interesting, so there is more than just the main square to see.Be careful when walking around the souks if you are approached and asked to visit the Tannery. We know of friends who have then been and were aggressively asked afterwards for money for being guided to the venue.There are plenty of trips out of Marrakech and I would recommend \u2018Dunes and Deserts Exploration\u2019 as a company. We pre-booked a day out on quad bikes and it was awesome.Marrakech is perfect for a short trip where you will experience the culture and vibrant way of life. We loved it."

            "review": "Chaos With A Character, Madness Of Marrakech Medina. You may be one of the few who may fall into the trap of thinking that the Medina of Marrakech is a bit hyped. After all it's a very crowded market place with a lot of noise, people selling all sorts of things under the sun. Think before you commit to this assumption by asking yourself that how many of such chaos you would have seen in the world which come with a character? Having travelled extensively all over India and being raised in crowded countries like Bangladesh, I am no stranger to crowd and chaos. What is unique and appealing about the Medina of Marrakech was the fact that it is chaos with a character where even the cacophony had a certain charm, not found or experienced by me anywhere else in the world. Protected by the old city walls, the Medina of Marrakech was declared a UNESCO heritage site. When we drove near the Medina to look for a parking space, the frantic commotions of the parking attendants and volunteers set the tone very well of what to expect later. Haggling was the first hint, starting with the cost of parking per hour. We made our way walking slowly along with the stream of people who were happily taking part in the joyful buzz of the surroundings. We were warmed up by curious onlookers, beggars, bemused tourists and locals when we arrived at the famous Jemaa al Fena, the coveted main square of the Medina where it all happens. You will see a handful of orange juice stalls and it is certainly a good idea to fill your tank with some fresh Moroccan orange juice before you set off to negotiate with the teeming crowd everywhere. The first rule of exploring the Medina is to make sure you have the main square in your mind map. The second rule is that you need to be comfortable with the fact that you will get lost and it is perfectly fine. So have plenty of time in your hand. The final rule is that you have to return to main square before sunset and place yourself at one of the many restaurants with a view to enjoy the sunset while you sip some mint tea. That is it; mind these three rules and you will be mad about the Medina. While we wandered around the serpentine narrow alleys of the Medina (Souks as they call it) we saw items and artefacts of Moroccan tradition ranging from shoes, clothes, lights, spices, olives to stuffed and even live animals for sale. Here is a good activity you can engage yourself into if you really want to keep yourself busy. Start taking count of the unique items and objects you will encounter during your stroll through the Medina from one Souk to another. When you are back at your riad or hotel, count the numbers. This is exactly what will give you an idea of what is available in Morocco and what is traded. What is traded is what gets consumed and what gets consumed makes the customers - the Moroccans who live in this enthralling country making the very fabric of the society and tradition they keep alive. It is taken for granted that you will end up in the Jemaa al Fena square at some point of your discovery of the souks. We can recommend securing a good seat on the second floor of the Cafe France restaurant just before sunset. Order yourself some mint tea and settle yourself while the sun will set behind the proud minarets of the Koutoubia Mosque, splashing a ravishing tone of orange in the western sky. While you enjoy the beautiful silhouette of the minaret against the sleeping sun, you will get to hear the increasing bustle from the Medina beneath you. Makeshift restaurants will install themselves cooking Moroccan delicacies on the spot, the aroma of which will be too hard to deny even for the staunch hardliners who avoid street food due to hygiene. You will want to mingle with the amazing characters who bring to life and loudness the whole place every day, year after year. Snake charmers, monkey players, henna artists, musicians, magicians: to name a few all in one place. Is this an amusement park? Is this a circus? You may ask yourself. This is the Medina madness with the chaos with a character is what you will realise only when you will retreat to the tranquillity of your Riad, when the gentle sound of flowing water from the fountain will pacify your mind, once the anti-climax of the loud chaos will be offset with the calm of the night, you will enlighten yourself only at that moment why is it so vibrant and full of sound, color and smell in the Medina. The reason is that the Medina of Marrakech is the lifeline of this city which narrates the story of the city every day to tourists and locals alike. It is the story teller with a character. Other places in the world may only have chaos, but no story to tell, thus no character. Only Marrakech, only Medina. More of our experience can be found at www.onetimefashionista.com"

It is an interesting juxtaposition of opulence and poverty. Don't listen when someone tells you that a road is closed and try and direct you somewhere else. Also be wary of people coming up to you and asking if you remember them from the Riad. Try and plan your route and don't look too lost.

It also helps to stay in a riad within the medina (I highly recommend Riad Nashira!!) so that getting there is easy. Plus the riads will always have very clear directions for to and from their location and at Riad Nashira, they had someone walk us to the medina. Once there, it can be stimulation overload. If you see animals (turtles, chameleons, etc) they are props to get you closer to the store so you will buy something. I didn't mind it since at one of the stores, I got to play with a chameleon for over 10 minutes. The trade off was that I had to buy something but since I was already in the market for some spices, it was a win win for me. They packaged up by lavender, saffron, tea and rose oil while I enjoyed the company of my little friend. So advise: don't play with the animals unless you are interested in buying something. If its just some guy walking around with an animal, be prepared to give him money for a photo or to pet it. Also never pay full price for anything. You will find 100 stall selling the same exact things. You should go in to every purchase with an amount you are willing to part with for the item you want. Tell them your price and then walk away. >90% of the time, they will chase you down (walk slowly away) with the item you wanted packaged, agreeing to your price. They will always ask you for a price that is also fair for them but keep in mind, their price is not in any way fair for us. I have noted the price they give locals and the price they give us. Even my lowest offers were more than what the locals paid so just keep that in mind. This Medina though is one of the most memorable places you will ever visit. Take your time and really enjoy it. Eat the street meat like the locals. Drink tea out of the glass cups like the locals. You won't regret it"

Our hotel told us that they would not turn the meter on for foreigners, they offered to negotiate fares for us. They were still far more than they should have been. We learned the hard way to give them the money before we started to avoid the argument at the end. We were accosted regularly outside our hotel by guides claiming to be from the hotel. \" you don't remember me? I work at----\"! Finally my husband whipped out his iPhone to take a picture. The guides evaporated. It was too bad to resort to unpleasant measures but la shukaran did not usually work. I ended up doing some shopping at the Ville Nouvelle boutiques after finding the souks too difficult as one could not stop and look or discuss anything without hassle. Moroccan acquaintances said it was difficult for them as well, but as sympathetic as they were, it did not leave me with a very positive memory of my Marrakesh experience. Fes is equally interesting and calmer!"

Stick to your price if you want something-but be fair and respectful-after all they are only trying to make a living!The scarves are beautiful in many sizes and shades & there is some very good value leather goods on sale, along with some colourful & unusual items of jewellery.There are acrobats, snake charmers and Henna tatooists in the main square and also many stalls selling soft drinks, snacks and refreshments.Be warned if you eat in one of the restaurants overlooking the medina you will be charged a lot more to eat there-simply for the view,but you can get the real feel by sitting on one of the benches in the centre & eating with the locals-having the food prepared in front of you for a real Moroccan experience-this is what we thought was the better experience.A great experience we will be repeating in the future!"

A strange experience, on a regular basis, was that we were told that it was closed as we headed in certain directions. This is clearly a ploy to get tourists heading into the souks and towards the main square. We did venture into the area of the tanneries which was a real treat, although I would advise doing this with a guide or be willing to pay a small amount to a local who will say he is not a guide but will look for payment after taking you into the works. But it is a true experience for a number of the senses, not least smell. Apart from the misdirections we never felt threaten or uncomfortable.

With so many different things to see and some amazing architecture, colours, smells, people - and donkeys!! We went as two females (me being 23 and blonde) and didn't use a guide, the best tip we got was only use left or rights when navigating your way round the souks, that way you can easily find your way back.  Most of the time we felt safe, although we quickly learnt to not listen to some locals (unless you ask a shop keeper and spend time looking in their shops). Numerous times people will approach you and try to Direct you (often the wrong way if you refuse the help). We also learnt not to tell people where you are heading if they ask, we got told things were closed when they weren't, in exchange for 'showing us a way back' - this guy later on got chased by the police and we were told he was not helping us and directed correctly by the police (to the museum which was open). There is little red or green squares high up I the side of buildings telling you the directions. - USE THESE! They may take you a long way round but you get to see plenty!Another tip of mine would be use an app such as mapmywalk - it's amazing to see how far you walk and although it can get confused with all the little alleys- it can help you get your barrings slightly! The lovely thing about the place is there is still locals everywhere and they are living their daily lives. Also, if you are not confident in haggling the 'ensemble artisanal' is a great little centre with lots of shops with fixed prices. It's also a good way to guide you before your haggling! Relax- but not too trusting and you'll have a wonderful time!"

A little daunting to start for some but not so big that you won't eventually find yourself standing somewhere familiar and worse case scenario is that someone will lead you to where you want to go for a small fee.Most of the major Marrakech tourist attractions can be found within the medina walls along with numerous restaurants and small hotels. Guides (both official and not so) are available at all attractions, again for a fee. They will also try to take you round the souks but if you go with a guide be prepared for long visits to local pharmacies and workers co-operatives. We did this on our first visit but now prefer to wander round on our own; we enjoy the banter with the shop owners and just say no and walk away when we're not interested. Marrakech has a wide range of multiple starred hotels but we would always opt for a small Riad in the medina."

Thus we saw a lot of the medina wherever we wanted to go.One could perhaps say it's amazing to see and experience it, and I'd probably say it's worth to experience this at least one time in your life.The medina consists of many small streets: Where the buildings end, the streets begin immediately and this space is shared by whatever shopkeepers put out in front of their shops, by motorbikes, by bicycles, by pedestrians, by carts pulled/pushed by donkeys, motorbikes or people. We never felt comfortable walking hand in hand, in stead we filed behind each other just watching out for the traffic. We only saw one motorbike crash into a bicycle in the 4 days we were there! Along with the pollution, it wasn't all that pleasant to walk around there.Even if you just look ahead of you, shopkeepers still try to grab your attention. If you show even the slightest interest some of the many crafty goods that are sold, a hassle about the price begins. If you really do want to buy something, you can get the price down a bit and to really get it lower just walk away, at which time a price might be shouted after you. Sometimes we were offered this \"democratic\" price - still don't know what this term is supposed to mean! However, all this non-stop hassling is rather tiring and it's impossible to just admire the goods on display. Perhaps if they didn't try so hard, we would buy more and at least have enjoyed it more.We were pursuaded into going with a guide to see some of the tanneries. He didn't tell us that he'll charge us 200dh for it, so I gave him 50dh afterwards, which made him show his sad face, as many of them do. We were also taken to a shop and sat down with a cup of tea and being displayed carpets to buy: The one we liked started at 6800dh and we bought it for 1650dh. Watch out for unstable dyes in the carpets - we effectively ruined ours when we got home by getting it wet. I'm not really sure the prices are that good and it seems really easy to get ripped off completely.There are some cash machine in the main square but not really anywhere else we could find.Several times, someone would point us in the opposite direction where we wanted to go, simply shouting that the square is the other way, or that it's closed this way. Don't listen to this dishonest advise. Rather, cache the maps on your smartphone and use your GPS to navigate yourself to where you want to go, or get lost for a while and then navigate yourself back.Our desire to go back to the medina is rather little, but I reckon we're glad we had the experience."

On the minus side, you will over pay for it, since you will generally have no basis for what anything actually costs, and the starting price is literally 4-6x the final price (if you have the skill).But if you're not shopping and just walking, there is much to see there. Unfortunately you cannot stop without being accosted by the merchants. If you want real shopping I suggest you go to the Taroudant or Essaouira Medinas. Friendlier merchants, and starting and ending prices. Outside the Souks, there is a lot to explore in the twisting and winding streets. All the little museums and buildings are worth seeing. The price of $3-6 buys you entrance to most, where you'll spend 30 minutes to an hour of enjoyable time.Marrakesh is a great city to go to view and see. The Djemaa El Fna is a free stage play all day and well into the night. I ate the snails there and survived fine."

The sights, sounds and smells of the various food venders is incredible and you feel as if you've entered another world. Haggle for everything and offer a third of what the seller says, it's common knowledge that's what they expect to get so stick your ground.I found using a small bit of Arabic was greatly appreciated by most and it was easier to get rid of overbearing street sellers.Avoid asking people on the street for directions, the police and some shop owners are generally happy to give you some sort of direction."

It's a real hubbub and is a must-see for anyone whose idea of a busy shopping area is Oxford Street. The main square is full of people trying to sell their wares, performers hoping for contributions and all manner of snake-charmers, monkey owners and henna artists. Be careful - they will offer to let you touch a snake,take your photo with a monkey, or paint a pattern on your hand - tell them you have no money and they say it's free, then they harrass you for cash. One even tried to march me to a cashpoint! My tip - stay clear and watch from a distnace, and avoid any conversation.The souks are where the real pleasure can be found. Tiny shops selling everything from handmade jewellery to soaps to spices to linen to designer clothes... or at least very good copies. Again, be wary of peole who offer to help you when you're lost or simply need to ask where something is - they all want paying! But the good side is that you can haggle for some great bargains. Don't ever pay full price; don't even pay half. We knocked one shop down from 1,200 dirhams to 200 dirhams for a necklace, and then bought a top for 200 dirhams which was first priced at 650 dirhams.At night the medina turns into a mini food festival, and the atmosphere is quite incredible. All manner of food is available, but check prices first and also watch for cleanliness - my own glass was drained and taken away from me, then given to someone else to use without washing it!All in all, a fun and interesting experience, but pretty exhausting."

In large areas of the town there are no pavements and motor vehicles, motor cycles, bicycles and pedestrians are all on the road. The cars and motor bikes drive on the roads haphazardly just missing other road users. The pollution is extremely high.The places of interest have no real interest at all and are extremely overrated. The people of Marrakech treat tourists with disdain and only want to see how much money they can obtain from them. If you ask for directions they expect payment. There are various scams like pretending they want to help you find where you are going only to try to take you to a shop to buy some spices or oil In the Souks for which they charge an extortionate amount.To eat out in decent restaurants is as expensive or more expensive than London and the taxis are constantly trying to rip you off.

I certainly think I achieved that.I read somewhere that the wall around the Medina is 17km which means that (if circular) the old city is about 6km across. That feels about right -- I spent three days walking the narrow streets and there were certainly places I didn't see, but I have a very good overall impression. Here are some bullet points that might help you:1. Everyone is very friendly and the Medina (and indeed the whole of Marrakech.. probably Morocco entirely) is very safe. You will never feel threatened or at risk. 2. On every street corner there will be at least one young man. As you walk past, he will say one of the following:-a. \"That was is closed\" (it isn't);b. \"Only today Berber people are in Marrakech\" (they aren't);c. \"Square is that way\" (it may or may not be).It isn't that they are in any way bad... they are just trying to drum up business by diverting you towards \"their\" shop or whatever. If you stand still and look lost, you risk hiring a guide -- who may or may not lead you to your destination by a route which may (or may not) be direct. And will then want a tip (probably he will ask for 200 Dh, but you can laugh at this and give him zero, 50 or 100 depending how generous you are feeling, how far he took you and whether he actually took you to the right place). You can of course start the journey by telling them that you will not be paying them a tip.... which may (or may not) work. 3. If you want to buy stuff in the souk, I strongly recommend that you hold off, ideally for a day but at least for a couple of hours while you get the hang of negotiating and prices. You could see the same \"silk\" scarf for Db 1000, 100 or 10 at three different stalls. Likewise rugs and anything else. If you walk into a stall, you will need to be quite firm to get out again without purchasing something. I had one guy chasing me down the street, reducing prices all the way, just because I expressed an interest in a penknife. It is all quite good-natured but some people might find it rather wearing after a while.4. The Medina is a total maze of tiny streets -- most no more than 1.5m-2m wide but with people, hand-carts, donkey-carts, motorbikes and occasionally vehicles all competing for space... along with vendors offering their wares on mats. No road runs straight and you will feel like you have been turned around a million times and have no sense of direction. Sometimes there are signs that appear mutually exclusive (e.g. Jemaa el Fna both Left and Right). Just go with the flow and treat every getting lost as an exploration. Eventually you will get yourselves back to familiar territory (normally Baab Mellah, Jemaa el Fna or Baab Debagh).5. Be respectful. Moroccans are friendly and easy-going but some do not like to have their picture taken.Enjoy!"

While in Djemma El Fna, you definitely have to be on your guard, but little away from it we could relax. On this stretch, until the last 100 meters or so before the square, people were very friendly to us. Invariably the topic of much loved Bollywood films would be opened, and people would tell us about their favourite memories of Bollowood heros and heroines. The fifty plus would talk about Dev Anand while the thirty minus wouldl talk about Shahrookh Khan. the language of communication was a problem, but you can manage. But nobody really tried to fleece us on this stretch except the occasional banter.And the views and mood would be different at different times of the day. Early morning -everywhere, you have the vegetable, fruit and meat sellers; the bakeries making different breads - the lubia and baseera seller (we used to join in and eat and sample everything); later all other kinds of establishment would open. Very crowded between 10am nad 2pm and again from 5pm to 10pm. But night time beyond 10pm was also very pleasant as we would peep into the bakeries (attached to the hammams) trying to line up the tangia pots in the cinders.

You will see all sorts of meat, veg, bread etc. displayed, as well as what they think tourists will be tempted by. It's fascinating and very easy to get lost. Beware of the friendly young men who offer to show you the way as they will want paying when you arrive at your destination. One thing to be really careful of is the manic moped riders who whizz down the lanes with little regard for pedestrians. Always walk to the right to avoid being hit by them."

They sense that your foreign - and approach you to make quick money - beware of the same.The maps of the medina are not accurate, at least the ones handed out at the riads etc they show streets that are not present, it would be difficult to make a map for such a place!Live outside the medina, and just spend an hour or so here to get a flavor, no more than that."

And did we bargain!!! Without pressure and the ability to look, and compare.

The medina was ok if you like that sort of thing, be prepared for it being very dirty and very smelly, hygiene is a major issue here so be very careful and make sure you take tissues and hand sanitizer. The first sight we got when walking up the median was a horse and trap driver urinating in the street and wasn\u2019t bothered about exposing his genitals to whoever was passing. The snake charmers were trying to get the snakes to dance even though it is winter and they want to hibernate, so they smack and taunt them to wake them up, making monkeys dance when they don\u2019t want to, Yes I know that this is their way of life and I understand that some people will love this kind of thing, I\u2019m just saying I didn\u2019t and found it to be very upsetting. THE TOMBS - we went to the tombs - PLEASE DONT GET A TOUR GUIDE it will take you all of 5 minutes to go round them, But you will love the architecture inside its stunning, not much else to see and very difficult to find, across from the palace and located past the souks and shops on a back alley that is not signposted at all, I think they want you to ask them so that they can get paid to point you in the right direction, nothing is free here.FANTASIA- If you can book the fantasia night it is one heck of a funny experience, one you will never replicate and we found it wonderful, it was very traditional, authentic and they gave a wonderful service, be careful of the food though, this is a set menu and you really are unsure of what you are eating , we had lamb but we had the WHOLE animal in 1 pot including everything that comes with an animal, very interesting, it cost 450 dirhams per person and this was for the transport, entertainment and food (DRINKS and SERVICE ARE NOT INCLUDED) if you are a cautious eater like me I ate an apple so it was a very expensive meal for 2 of our party as we both only ate an apple.Our taxi driver was absolutely wonderful and was very helpful. Just be aware that the show they put on after the meal is about 1 hour long in the summer but they cut it back to approx 10 minutes in the winter and still charge you the full amount so this was very disappointing and you feel a little cheated.THE ANIMALS - be careful around the feral dogs and cats, I say be aware, you can\u2019t miss them as they are everywhere and I found it very upsetting when I saw dogs being hit with bricks and rocks, I am a dog owner myself and found it very upsetting, There cats are the everywhere and they are extremely matted with scabs and blinded with tics and with so many of them that you can\u2019t help and just have to walk by. Anyway I\u2019m done now, to summarise, I found Marrakech different, not as cultural as I expected and certainly an eye opening and is a place that I would not wish to return to, my husband compared this to the slums in Slum Dog Millionaire and he isn\u2019t far off in that description but make your own mind up about it as everyone has a difference perspective on it."

Look up at the ceiling for signs for the square, or pay a little kid to show you the way back. We decided to wander and risk getting lost, and we walked for hours down tiny lanes and alley ways and saw the back of the medina. This can be daunting if you are a single woman so I'd suggest being on your guard. However, as a couple we didn't experience any danger or hostility.It is dirty, crowded and smelly, but it's worth doing. You could easily spend hours in here just wandering around all the different shops. There are lots of smaller bazaars too with some interesting things to see. My tip is to do some reading up about bargaining with shopkeepers so you can see how it's done and get yourself a good deal."

ALWAYS negotiate pricing if you're interested in purchasing an item.Also, locals really do not like tourist taking pictures of them or the stalls so politely ask for permission.DO NOT give children or men money if they say they are a guide when you do get lost; politely smile and say no thank you.I found that speaking Spanish to the locals helped me out far more than my English - so if you can speak French or Spanish the locals will be able to assist you better.And lastly, even though I got lost countless amount of times, I never felt like I was in harm's way.I felt pretty safe. There are few bathroom facilities where you have to pay a fee to get in but if you can hold it I suggest heading to a restaurant/cafe in the square or heading back to your hotel/riad.I can't wait to go back and visit again!"

Unfortunately, had a few bad experiences (like getting yelled at for no particular reason - got called a skinhead, im simply bald!! or having my girlfriend continually harassed, and she was dressed in very conservative clothing) After a couple days it simply got too much. Monkeys on chains, kids begging in streets (have a look at pics). Motorcycles within inches of hitting you and constant harassment for money in some way, shape or form. A few times people tried to scam us like bringing us to restaurants that were actually closed!!!I understand that Morocco is a developing country and that the people there are simply trying to make out a living, but I think its probably gone a bit too far with regards to looking at westerners as a cash point. I had wanted to see and experience the Moroccan culture. We simply weren't able to experience it in Marrakesh and the Medina in particular. I loved the rest of our trip to Morocco (Imlil and Essaouria) as they seemed more genuine and authentic. I would imagine that others would love the craziness - maybe it just wasnt for us :)"

The prices are always upped for tourists hence you should be ready to haggle. You can get the prices really low depending on how good you are. Don't be rude, just smile and offer them what you think is the best price. If they say no just walk away, they will come after you and sell for the price you asked for... trust me! ... Be aware of men/kids lingering around trying to find lost tourists (its easy to get lost in those alleys). They will try to offer you directions and to walk with you but at the end will ask you for money. Even if you are lost, don't have a puzzled or lost expression on your as that attracts more of them. Be confident and just tell them you know where you going. Ask shops for directions instead. Overall it is very safe and you can walk around freely in the after hours. Also beware of the little bikes zooming around. But the biggest thing to remember if shopping - haggle haggle haggle ;)"

We spent a total of 5 days in Marrakech and we stayed in a Riyad near Jamaa al fena as we found spending time in the medina an absolute delight for many reasons.From our very first morning we decided to brave our way through the alleyways of the souks armed with a map. From that point onwards we spent a lot of time roaming the streets of the souks where we started off shyly bargaining but then learned the power of walking away!!! 9 times out of 10 the merchants agreed to our chosen price so make sure you bargain for EVERYTHING!!Food wise we enjoyed eating from the stalls in Jamaa al fena as there was quite a lot on offer. However, this was only available in the evenings so I strongly recommend going for a Riyad/hotel with breakfast included as then you will only have lunch to worry about.We also visited the palaces and the synagogue which, although architecturally interesting, we completed in a couple of hours as there wasn't much to see.All in all it was a magical experience which I would say is a MUST if you are planning a trip to Morocco :)"

Also fun to interact with the salesman at shops doorsteps. They tend to be very nice and funny, always making jokes and usually spoken in lots of languages. Try not to enter the shop thou, or you will find yourself \"forced\" to buy something. They don't seam to have that \"just looking\" western costume.PS: also be alert of some strange folks sitting or standing leaning in the walls or corners offering haxixe.

They really overprice everything, so always bargain, we got 70% off the original price on almost everything we bought.My recommendations: Try to walk on one side of the street, as there are bikes, motor bikes, carts, and even cars running all over. Also, wear comfortable but closed shoes, as the streets are cobbled and dirty. Use maps and gps on your phone (we used the Here app) to go around the Medina; even if you get lost, you will easily go back on track, and will prevent you from asking for directions and then being asked for money in return (this did not happen to us, but a lady we met in the riad was upset by this). If you want to get rid from a vendor, offer a really really low price, and they will leave you alone. And never ever accept presents from anyone in the souks, because they will charge you for that afterwards (we also learned this from the lady at our riad). There are some little things like these that can spoil your trip and make upset and want to leave, unfortunately that was the case of the nice lady we met in our riad.

Besides that, your senses are on a trip of a lifetime. The smells are amazing(Sometimes not), the sights are remarkable, the taste of the street food is another level, they know their way around a spice rack, the sounds of the local lingo and music is refreshing, however sometimes drowned out by the scooters.

The vendors are much more aggressive and you certainly can not trust their prices. You really have to be firm and be prepared to walk when bargaining with them. What REALLY was disappointing was all the scooters and motorbikes in all of the alleys of the souks...something you don't encounter at all in Fez. We continually had to go the outside of the alleys as otherwise, you would be hit with the scooter or motorbike. If you have enough time to visit both Marrakech and Fez, do so as both are different and both have something to offer. However, if you only have time to go to one city, go to Fez. There are far more shops, the merchandise is of much better quality, and you won't be hassled as much. We were not impressed with the main square at night either. The vendors during the day have to take down their stalls and restaurants and other stalls go up in the evening. Then we mainly saw knock off Chinese merchandise being sold...you know, genuine Rolex watches for like $10!!!If you get off the main square and away from all the noise and action in the evening and go down some of the smaller alleys, there are very nice restaurants in the medina of Marrakech. Overall, we were very happy with our riad, very pleased with our evening meals, but disappointed in what type of activities were in the medina.

Over 1000 riads( small hotelsl with 8-12 rooms) is like oases in a city full of contrast..... I really recommended too visiti local Hammams ( one of them \"1001 night\") and the souks and Berbermarked give you both oportunities to take somting home and never forget voloures and smells ...like spices, flowers,argan oil, urin, goat and sheep. Its sad watchinh the dancing monkeys in dresse but is a part of the citypictures in the Medina... Remeber to carry with you marrocan dirham, but euros can be used some places. The travel agency Zbar Travel gives you the tour that is made for you.Tracking in Atlasmountains is beutiful and spectacular(4200 mao)"

A great way to pass some time and soak up local culture.A couple of points to note:It gets very touristy and a little chaotic closer to the main sqaure, \"the Jemaa el Fna\", so best to keep a little further north if you want something a little more authentic and calm. All the guide books say that you can see the Kotoubia Mosque from anywhere in the city. This is not true in the Medina and we found it much better to work off the sun. Its generally in the south around lunch time so you can gauge which direction to go off of that. The best way we found to navigate in and out of the Medina is by the gates which surround it. Each gate or \"Bab\" gives you access to a different side and is a very useful way to get your bearings. Also very useful for giving taxi men directions.Asking for directions can be more trouble than its worth. If you are really stuck ask shop keepers but by enlarge asking for directions will land you with an unwanted \"Guide\" hanging around too long and looking for something in return for his help. Best to pull out your map and have a crack at finding it yourself."

Do not be conned into being told it is a last day of an auction for leather goods, and then taken through a maze of streets for 20 minutes, to get to a tannery, which was revolting and sickening, and then to a shop selling leather goods, who's staff were unfriendly, rude and got aggressive when you bargained and did not buy. Then the person at the tannery had the cheek to ask for payment for taking you there and then snatching the money from your hands, when my friend asked how much and showed some money in her hands.

Enforcers circle the snake charmers area looking for tourists trying to take a freebie shot of the snake act. If they catch you plan to be shook down for more than if you volunteered in the first place.It's easy to get lost in the maze of alleys that form the souks and some areas are downright creepy. Some of the areas have workshops where they make all sorts of cheap tourist items, but again don't take their pictures unless you want to make a financial donation. Most of the really high end stores and most interesting stores are deep into the souks, so don't be afraid to explore, but leave a breadcrumb trail so that you can find your way out. There are some good restaurants in the plaza, look for the ones that are busy and look at their menu and prices.... some are very reasonable. You won't find any beer or wine here so plan on tea or a soda, although I saw some vendors traveling the restaurant tables selling bottles of something that looked like beer in a recycled containers. restroom facilities are available at most of the restaurants on the square and are in decent condition.I wouldn't travel alone here at night, but that's me. We only had a couple of hours here, I could have spent a couple of days exploring. Definitely the highlight of Marrakech."

We had a guide for half a day on our first day which I would recommend as he showed us around and pointed good spots to catch taxis a bit further away from the square to avoid rip offs. As other reviewers have said here, the Medina is a bit of a crazy place, with lots of people, smells- good and bad, donkey carts, mopeds etc. so you have to be alert and keep your wits with you especially in the evening to avoid being run over or hassled too much by the sellers. We did not experience any aggressive selling or rude behavior and this could be because my partner is a big hulky guy (on a few occassions they shouted Van Damme after him in a good humored way which was quite funny and made us all laugh), or it could be that our firm ''no thank you''- s were enough to leave us alone. In any case, showing (or pretending) that you know what you are doing helps. We enjoyed haggling and bought a few nice things at a good price. One thing I would say, and I think it has been said here before, is don't start haggling for the sake of it and then leaving without buying anything. This is def not liked and I get that as no one wants their time wasted. We deliberately tried to 'get lost' in the souks but somehow always managed to end up in the main square, finding hidden little streets in the process. We just looked around and tried to memorise spots which seemed to help.The Medina is a tiring experience though, having to stay alert all the time and all. Only if they just let you be! That would make such a difference! I don't think we would return to the Medina and Marrakesh but it was worth going once to see something different."

I read somewhere that some of cities in this part of the world was built so that attackers should get lost. This is exactly the feeling you have when you are guided around the medina, you loose the sense of location directly. I guess that if you walk on your own it is not that difficult to get back to the main square or one of the gates. And it is not big enough to get seriously lost.The medina is a wonderful experience with all the different kinds of people, shops, homes, motor bikes, donkeys and horses. The nice thing with a guide is that you may get to see some things out of the ordinary like the man tending the fire that keeps the hammam warm and the inside of a bakery. The sad thing is that you get to see other things out of the ordinary like the poultry shops with live animals in the back, slaughtered on a bench with the owners daughter sitting beside him on the bench eating her luncheon bread. I guess that these are the kinds of places where the bird flu makes its species hops."

To me, however, site seeing was limited to either shopping or the main square. The only other activities were the Saadin tombs and then hammams. Thr central area could use a couple museums that are higher quality with art and/or history - something like the one at thr Jardin Majorelle. Don't let this put you off from going by any means - just is my thought on future improvements for the area."

Use your GPS and Google Maps with your mobile and a local SIM.As we did some traveling in Marocco, we have been looking for details on GPS navigation in Marocco. And wanted telephone and intenet. We did not find a lot of usefull information on the internet. So let's share with you our experience. In the end it is very simple and cheap! And you defenately need help with Navigation in Marokko. There is no information, or it is written in Arab. We had a car but also needed it in cities to find places. It all went well thanks to INWI and Google Maps.TOMTOM? NO!We rented a Tomtom GPS in the Netherlands with a map of Marocco. Our experience: not usefull at all. It did not know locations, only some bigger streetnames. Worse, it did not know a lot of roads. It leaves you with very, very high level information and it is impossible to work with. Mostly you don't have a street name and the street are very confusing in Maroc.INWIThe smartest thing to do is to buy a local SIM card for your smartphone in Marocco. We bought it upon arrival at the Marrakesh airport, near the car rental desks. There is a INWI desk (Purple sign). Go there, pay 120 dirham (about \u20ac11 - $15) for the 100 dirham INWI card: ZEN CONNECT. The man behind the desk installed the simcard on our phone and made it work instandly. If you buy this card, only buy it in a place were they install it and make it work directly. We have seen more Purple INWI shops in Marocco. This gives you for 30 days:- 3 hours national phone calls- 1 GB data (mobile internet)- 1000 sms- we even used it to call to the Netherlands and it worked!Internet was not as fast as I am used to in The Netherlands, but he.... It is fast enough!GOOGLE MAPSOn our phone (with INWI) we used Google Maps. It is much more easy because you can enter nanes of restaurants, accomodations, atractions, places of interest, etc. It will find the place and take you there. You sometimes have to play a little but we did find everything we were looking for! Even restaurants in small streets in Medina Marrakech. It knows almost all little (ofroad) streets.USE IT and SHARE this informationIn our 10 days visit we were so happy we had this SIM that gave us directions, mobile internet and telephone. Whitout it we would have been lost. Or worse, victim of all the \"local friends\", (we call hustlers) that give you tips and directions. Not always good and always costing you money! Now it was easy to find our own way or check information and prices directly on the internet.Happy Traveling!"

Like all medinas they are vast maze and soooo easy to get lost - Marrakech more so as it's bigger and has more cultural and culinary delights then the other medinas. Def book a guide first day it's way to get some orientation and knowledge of the area. They will also be able to take to to the souks that u are interested In. Also they can point out locations of interesting cultural sights which like everything are hard to find. If your time is limited a guide is essential, they are accredited and are always locals (part of the accreditation).I stayed for 5days at the end of a 2 weeks tour. The guide was a really great way to start - made me more comfortable exploring on my own.Ladies do be respectful esp if your your own - I wore mid to long pants, loose tops that at least covered my shoulders, at night I wore a scarf and felt safe wandering the medina on my own.You will get hassled/pressured to buy and come across some rude annoying people. It is frustrating and stressful sometimes, I don't deny it especially if you are staying in the medina. However, they are the minority and mostly the haggling and banter is good fun commerce. Don't be afraid to check out some of the riads w courtyards and/or rooftop terraces that host caf\u00e9s or restaurants -often u will walk thru a carpet or other shop politely decline as they are often lead to a hidden oasis - good idea to do this during the day so hopefully you can find it a bit easier if you come back at night! For the more budget travelers - you simply must treat yourselves to a couple nights in a good riad - you get brilliant Moroccan hospitality (I found the staff in cheaper hotels in new towns throughout morocco exceptionally rude) the riad also it's a great respite from the hustle and bustle that is Marrakech. One the most memorable palaces - yes it was palatial- I have ever stayed in. Find yourself a good Hamaam again do this in daylight it's a great evening activity esp if you are on your own. I did a one on one cooking class with riad that also took me to the markets to purchase ingredients - a great local experience. (Riad Kniza)I have read reviews good and bad - I think it is what u make of it and how you behave with locals that makes the difference. After a couple of day I was waving and chatting to familiar faces in the medina, invited for countless glasses of mint tea from shopkeepers to have a chat not to buy, on my last day I was getting hugs goodbye and even got a lift on a motorcycle back to the riad I stayed in! Oops forgot Photos - Moroccans do not like their photos taken as a rule. Chat to your guide usually it's a lot easier to snap away and they will explain the I would always ask a shop keeper even if I had bought something it's usually about respect not money except at Jemaa el-Fnaa it's all about money there- it's also serves as an anchor I would always find my way back there when lost. Don't let that put you off - by day it does not look much by night it's exciting and vibrant to explore. Tipping is everything in Morocco, hard to get use to but a way of life. A lot if deeds will be expected to be rewarded with a tip Eg It's usually easy to figure out who is really giving directions and those hoping to get a few dirhams. I would address this politely early on to avoid any dramas. Always carry some small change. It's a long review but I hope it helps especially single female travelers - it also applies to all the medinas I visited. Oops last tip - can't remember what they are called but find yourself one of the fruit salad/smoothie caf\u00e9s in new town the drinks/fruit salads are a meal in themselves - these places are true local hang and for good reason as they are delicious and like nothing I have seen before. (Ask you your guide)"

The reason that I awarded an average score is that it is impossible to navigate your way around and we ended up getting massively lost. Many of the locals charge for directions so we could not ask for help. Therefore I did not get a chance to properly look around and buy anything.My only regret about my trip to Marrakech is that I didn't have enough time to visit here again. I am sure if I had visited again I would have loved it. If your time in Marrakech is limited, book a guide so that you do not miss out."

You can shop and haggle for your souvenirs here. Before you go to the bazaar one suggestion: go to the local souvenir shop and price the goods there. The locals that are hocking their wares here are quick to mark up and charge more to the unsuspecting tourist! Once you know what is a fair price in the souvenir shop you have a basis to start your haggling. Offer about 1/2 of what you would pay in the souvenir shop and work your way up from there. The locals can be very aggressive and a bit scary at first, but once you stand your ground an offer a fair price they will quickly accept. I had one experience where an aggressive monkey owner put his monkey on my shoulder and let me pet him and then demanded about $20.00 for the experience! I offered him $5.00 and he kept pushing for the $20.00 at which point I started to leave and he gladly accepted the $5.00.The food is authentic and quite tasty. The people are glad to help for a $ or two. Music, snake charmers and locals make it well worth-while.The cemetery is worth seeing The medina and narrow streets can be a bit intimidating yet gives you a feel for the culture and how they live."

            "review": "Unreal experience!. It took me a little while to actually get used to this place. Its completely foreign for me and was a massive culture shock. There are people EVERYWHERE. Singing, dancing, selling stuff, begging, people with monkeys, birds, lizards, snakes, squirrels - everything you can think of is pretty much in this place!Its also a complete shock to your system in terms of what you're going to see and smell and hear. There is just so much going on its difficult to know where to look and what to do if you're not used to it! Be brave though - this is an amazing cultural experience that you cannot miss.We went through the market on our own as my husband is a big guy and is pretty experienced with these sort of markets - but if you're a newbie, or on your own I would highly recommend that you invest in a tour guide. They are pretty inexpensive, and will help ensure that you don't get hassled or led astray by people who want you to go visit their shop/business. A couple of tips what we were given which I thought I'd pass on to you are:1) Don't eat the food, and drink bottled water - We were told by our hotel guide that they cook with water that is basically sewerage water. That being said - the Lonely planet guide tells you to try the food. If you're brave go ahead and do it (the food looks and smells amazing), but if you're like me and have a tender belly, don't do it - as tempting as it is.2) As a lady I was worried about covering my head in respect for the culture and religion. It really wasn't necessary as most people seemed pretty OK with modern women from other countries and religions. Just to be safe (and respectful) though - I wore long pants and a sleeved shirt, and carried a scarf with me just to be sure. I never had a problem and never needed the scarf.3) Be aware that you're most likely going to see things that aren't like home. I did see some things that made me sad. This is a poor country - lots of beggars and lots of very sick people on the streets without footwear etc. There was also some animals in cages that I didn't really approve of. I think if I had known that this was the case I would have mentally prepared and then wouldn't have been so upset. So I'm warning you now. This is a cultural experience and things are not like what they are at home.4) Don't trust anyone! Especially if you chose to go alone. People will come and follow you and tell you that they will be your guide, and that they work for your hotel and are here to help them. Or they might come and tell you that there is a 'Big sale!' nearby that you have to go and look at. Just be polite, and kindly tell them that you're ok. Or if they won't leave you alone just lie and tell them you've found your destination or whatever. Or tell them that you're a local and don't need a guide. 6) Know your currency, and take some small change so you can enjoy the buskers - There is so much to see! And heaps you'll want to interact with. Pretty much EVERYTHING costs though - so take some small change to pay the snake charmer for a photo - or give a tip to the ladies doing the henna. You can't watch or interact without paying something. Also make sure you know the exchange rate so you don't get ripped off while bartering. Someone tried to charge us the equivalent of $100AU for a tshirt thinking we didn't know what 700 durha was (we ended up actually getting it for about $10).Most of all enjoy your time here. Take the time to really explore and chat with the locals and pick up some awesome bargains! I would LOVE to go back again and do some more shopping. Have fun!"

We were taken into a pharmacy and given a talk on all the products they had. They could cure everything! At the end of the talk came the sales pitch, everything was well overpriced.

These are small rugs made by Berber women in their spare time. Tearing old \u201csynthetic\u201d clothes into strips, the women tied them into artful weavings. The history of the women is reflected: a dress they wore years ago, a husband\u2019s old shirt, a child\u2019s blouse. The stories and process are well documented.

This time it was with my wife to celebrate an anniversary. Jemaa el Fna square and the souks are a unique adventure which have to be experienced. The souks sell a huge variety of items from leather goods, china, pottery, to spices, local perfumes and oils, the senses are totally over whelmed. There is a huge selection of bars and restaurants as well, all the food we had was acceptable to excellent. We didn\u2019t do many of the other tourist sites, we aren\u2019t really into that, instead we had a Hamman and massage, which was great and reasonably priced.The down side is the constant hassle from traders to buy their goods, from leaving our Riad and walking 500 m I must have been asked 20 times if I wanted to buy something and some of them are really pushy, you have to be very thick skinned!! You also have to also have to navigate your way along very narrow lanes, competing for space with mopeds/scooters who whizz along, cyclists, donkey\u2019s and carts, it is a nightmare, I am surprised there aren\u2019t more accidents. The worst culprits though are the locals who ask you if you are lost and then try and insist that they show you the way somewhere. One guy just followed us after some casual conversation and then told me I had to give him some money. I am not easily intimidated and I told him where to go, but my wife was a bit shaken and it was an unpleasant experience. It\u2019s a shame really, because there are some genuine locals who just want a chat.Would we go back, probably, it is an interesting place with almost guaranteed sunshine."

It may look shabby (and admittedly a bit smelly in parts) but behind the closed doors you often find beautifully decorated restaurants, riads, courtyards. Just be careful around the tanneries area where there seems to be a large syndicate of men operating together - you will be expected to pay one man who introduces you to another who then takes you to a guide, who then drops you in a shop! They all expect paying - the guide wanted 100 MAD (about \u00a37). But this was the exception - we found most people happy to help wherever we went (though of course a small tip is always gratefully received). The number of stray and emaciated cats is distressing but the SPANA hospital can help - they treat and neuter for free - it's free to visit the hospital and see the work they are involved with!"

I consider myself to be an experienced traveller and have never felt particularly at risk in Marrakech, taking usual, sensible precautions. On this occasion I spent four days in Marrakech, as always staying at a Riad in the Medina - which provided the usual welcome Marrakech 'buzz' - it never disappoints. I thought it maybe helpful though to share my 'bag snatch' experience as I certainly learnt a lesson about becoming over confident in what had begun to feel like very familiar well trodden streets. Others have commented on the throng of traffic in the medina - pedestrians, donkeys with carts, bicycles and small motor bikes surround you. Walking down a surprisingly quiet street, it therefore did not strike me as unusual when I became aware of a scooter close behind me with a passenger on the back. I was totally unprepared for the passenger to grab my bag as they passed me and take off at speed disappearing into the melee before I even had time to register that my bag containing phone, money and bank card had been stolen. Indeed, my initial thought was that they had in error tried to pass too close to me, catching the bag strap in error and they would stop and return my bag to me. Sadly - naive in the extreme. I spent the next three hours in a police station ( having been sent from one station to another, a fifteen minute walk away) trying to report the theft which became farcical in itself - there was little interest or enthusiasm in taking the report. At one point three teenagers who had been caught stealing from another tourist were brought into the office I was waiting in, all handcuffed and wailing loudly. They were immediately surrounded by a number of officers far more interested in this drama than in taking my report - the officers began shouting at them and one officer kicked at them a number of times, forcing them to crouch on the floor and stand alternately. I was shifted around from room to room and was directed to wait for long periods of time in corridors with no explanation as to what was happening - after three hours I was told to return with my passport and that when I returned I would have to start the process again. Quite an experience and by the time I left ( with the promise I would return with my passport) I had not managed to get any officer to actually take any of the details despite being taken to various locations in the station and asked to retell the story to yet another disinterested officer barely making eye contact many times over. The only really helpful person in the station was a Moroccan lady who I initially thought worked there but later found was reporting a crime herself. It would have felt totally chaotic without her explanations, reassurances and suggestions. I didn't return to the station - I knew it would be fruitless. So all in all - the incident hasn't changed my view or love or Morocco but it has left me aware that unpredictable things can happen and the more relaxed you are the greater the risk maybe. True of any busy city in the world maybe and certainly many tourists in England experience similar situations. Don't be put off visiting Marrakech but do keep your wits about you. Make sure you have telephone numbers with you for cancellation of bank cards, sim cards etc just in case the worst happens - we had to phone a friend in England to get the relevant telephone numbers as internet access is limited in the Medina and signals poor often. Chances are it won't happen to you and you will have a thoroughly enjoyable holiday - just as I always have - I certainly will return to Marrakech certainly - a little wiser next time."

Wonderful things to buy, the metal work lamps are stunning but difficult to pack. Jewelry, fabrics, spices, fun slippers, leatherwork all good bargains to be had. Don't be too serious with your haggling, try joking and laughing it's much more fun and most of the stuff is quite cheap after a bit of haggling.

The snakes that were being held and walked around were quite small. There were monkeys on chains that you could hold for a photo, at a price of course and the money you offer is never enough. It was expected, but always disappointing when people show their true colours with greed.

We did see several accidents where people had been knocked off bikes/mopeds - they do have rules of the road in Marrakech - but no-one follows them :) We went to the square in the day (quiet) and at night (beyond busy) - the stink of ammonia from the horse pee may make your eyes water which happened to us - there are loads of horses with carriages (think Blackpool prom) stood around for hours and no rain between May to Nov to wash the waste away ..... We managed to avoid the henna tatooists and others selling various bits of tat - we went to a govt run shop (Ensemble Artisan) in the kasbah area (near the Koutoubia mosque - you will know you have found it as its the only store in Marrakech with escalators) the prices are fixed and very reasonable.

            "review": "A mixed bag!. Firstly, this is a very interesting area and a massive culture shock, which is what we wanted to experience. The medina itself is basically the old city of Marrakech, which is enclosed within the walls. There is a mosque, a large square, souks, museums, cafes, bars, shops and restaurants all enclosed within the medina. The first thing to hit you as you enter near the centre is the smell. There are lots of flies, horses, animal excrement and a strong smell of urine in 40 degree+ heat. Secondly, there are lots of vehicles, mopeds, trucks and bikes to keep your eye on. There are very few official street crossings and they tend to drive wherever they want. On top of this there are then street sellers constantly trying to get your attention with hats, toys and watches. So firstly, only go if you can keep your wits about you and your eye on everything going on and your wallet/bag/purse at the same time!I wouldn't recommend taking children any younger than teenagers as literally there is too much to keep your eye on already yourself let alone looking after young children (and they may not be as discreet about the smell! Oh from the mouths of babes...).My partner and I only ventured out once during the day ourselves and went twice more to the gardens and historical sights but guided. I would recommend going with guides if possible as they will tell street sellers to leave you alone and can get you through the mass of mazes without getting lost! We found it very difficult to follow roads and streets as streets are poorly laid out and signposted and often look the same. If you do go yourself, 2-3 hours max is all you need really.As a warning- women, keep your hands on your bags and another hand in a pocket or on a friend/partners arm - we were warned that women will come up to you, quickly grab your hand, draw a henna tattoo before you've realised and ask for 500dh (\u00a350). If your hands aren't free, they wont try it.The souks were an experience, easy to get lost and you have to be alert. But the smells of the spices, the street trades, the goods for sale were all worth the visit. So different, so diverse and amazing rainbows of colour through the streets were amazing. Again only go if you're fully awake- you're battling streets with few rules - donkeys, trucks and mopeds will surprise you and come very close without warning in heavily pedestrian areas. Walk to a side to try to avoid this!We were advised to only pay 1/3 of whatever price they tried to get from you in the souks. We got bored of the aggressive nature of selling in the end and walked along to 'ensemble artisan', a shop nearby controlled by the government, with set prices and no aggressive selling. Here I got a lantern for 40dh (about \u00a33) which is less than was being asked in the Souks and no pushy sales. Well worth a visit.I would definitely recommend adults visit the medina, but with a tour guide if possible!"

(The locally supplied \"maps\" of the Mediina are useless comic representations of the place!)Doing some shopping? Nothing is priced! Be prepared for the people to start at a very high price! They EXPECT you to negotiate. The best thing to do is to ask yourself how much you would be prepared to pay for an item at home. halve it, and start your haggling there. Don't get carried away and pay more for something than you would back home! Its easy to do! Be prepared to say \"no thanks\" and walk away.You can pick up some interesting bargains. Make sure that you have enough room in your suitcase to take everything home :-)"

Be prepared to spend a good few hours wandering around and don't be afraid to haggle if you want to buy something. It is expected!Do be aware of slightly more annoying individuals who will try to latch on to you and act as impromptu tour guides! We actually had a good and bad experience of this. An older gentleman called Mohammed proved a great source of information and was so charming, we ended up walking round for about 3 hours in his company! He knew lots about the medina and souks, the religious background of various buildings and sections of the medina. He took us off the beaten track of which we were a little wary at first, but it was worth it. On another occasion a teen ager rode his bike along side us for about 2 minutes, directing us to the main square, even though we didn't need or ask for directions as this was our 3rd visit. He asked for money and when we refused he got a little abusive, throwing every swear word he had learned at us. But it didn't ruin our visit and wouldn't put us off visiting gain."

The souk generally has the same merchandise. Know that some areas have a concentration of clothing, fabrics, rugs, woven handbags, or other items, but kitsch is everywhere. As for buying, definitely demand half the price originally quoted you, and work up very slowly. If it's something you can't live without, know that before you walk away from a deal for good.

(We visited this place in june 2013, but I still would like to share my experience with potential travelers)I totally agree with Charlene S: who is getting paid for writing good reviews? It is an awful place to stay because of a number of reasons!First of all the way they treat animals. Horses all day in the burning sun (in the summer!) without getting any water, monkeys on ropes etc etc). If you would see those things in Nordwest Europe, you would be shocked and call somebody to rescue those poor animals.Then, the husslers. They simply WON'T LEAVE YOU ALONE. They just want your money, and nothing else. There's no such thing as walking around and enjoying your holiday. Everybody wants something and that something is MONEY! They want you in their shops and restaurants so they get their commission! Honestly, if they would have left us alone, we surely would have bought some nice souvenir. But not now, they just don't seem to understand that their approach is working against them.It really bothered us that we had no space of our own. We felt pretty intimidated. We planned to stay here for two nights but we left one day earlier for Essaouira (nice place, almost no husslers!) just because we were fed up with it! If you like to be treated like a walking ATM, the medina of Marrakech is the place to be. If you don't and want to meet genuine people and a beautiful landscape, go somewhere else (Essaouira, the rural area)!"

We stayed in such a Riad, and yes you do need to beware of the traffic and the kids who mis-direct you, but it will be a great memory of mayhem, how the Riad (hotel) can be so uttery peaceful and have this outside is a constant wonder to us. Keep an eye on any kids, they won't be kidnapped or anything but can get immediately lost and the bikes flying down the narrow alleys are a big danger to those who are unaware.

If we hadn't been on the tour it would have been impossible to see the reality of life in the Medina because it can be daunting to venture down the narrow twists and turns. It's an amazing place - you can find virtually anything you want and get quite skilled at haggling; there are so many tempting spices, remedies, souvenirs, but then you remember the baggage limitations. It can be a little offputting seeing the flies feasting on the pastries or meat on sale, but it's all part of the experience!It's essential to wear comfortable shoes and have small change (10 dirham coins for example), to give if you pause to watch bread being made, or take a photo of a local. We had a lovely afternoon.Our tour guide was from Click Excursions, but be aware you will be taken to fairly pricey shops and a Moroccon pharmacy tour that extols the marvelous virtues of Aargan oil (without giving any prices) and before you know it, the total is a few thousand dirhams! Only on researching one of the products on return did I learn that the oil should never be kept on plastic bottles - dark bottles are better to avoid deterioration caused by sunlight. The key is to only buy what you really need and enjoy the testers and 20 dirham massage!"

In reflecting on the journey my wife and I took through Morocco, I have concluded no Moroccan journey can be complete without exploring the different Medinas of this Kingdom. While the Medinas are similar in many ways, they all have their unique characteristics which distinguish them. The Medina of Marrakech is a vibrant place that offers all manner of goods, foods, spices and fresh juices. Once the evening arrives, the vibrancy grows as the square comes alive with food stalls, acrobats, entertainers---and the scores of people there to experience it all. However, don\u2019t just look, try to enjoy and savor the experience. Try some delicious orange juice or lamb or just give a friendly \u201cbon jour\u201d or \u201cbon soir\u201d to one of the many friendly people you will meet.This Medina has generally wider passages which are open to the sky which lends a certain brightness to everything. However, as with all of the Medinas, the Marrakech Medina is a feast for the senses. From the spice souks, to the fresh roasted lamb, to the souks selling mint tea glasses, slippers and carpets there is a great deal to take in. You will also smell all of the fragrances from the different spices being sold throughout the medina.I recommend taking a day (or two or three. . . .) and explore the Medina during the day into to evening. The change is remarkable and somewhat unique to the Marrakech Medina. This experience will undoubtedly be a highlight of your journey through Morocco."

Lots of eating places that cater to the locals but as a tourist I would not eat anything in those places...The next day we went to see the touristy side.

In fact, it was so poor I am beginning to question the authenticity of the 'Excellent' and 'great' reviews written on here. I am genuinely at a point where I believe holiday makers are paid to write a good review so people visit the Medina when they go to Morocco. Here are just a few things we came across upon our visit to the Medina.  - animal cruelty is rife. Stray cats and dogs in the poorest of health roaming everywhere - The locals spit at you and give you intimidating stares if you wear shorts, show your shoulders or have your hair out - The Medina is VERY unsafe at night. Do NOT even think of going there if you visit during the month of Ramadan. (We only visited at night because it was closed during the day due to Ramadan) - Flies, bees, insects, whatever are all over the food in the market. Basically, if that was seen in England, it would be H&S and the stall would be closed down.  - Very poor hygiene in and around the Medina - The smell.... Don't even get me started on the smell. Horse poo, camels, large unemptied bins overflowing with rubbish, sewerage.. These are all the smells we smelt on a daily basis.There is nothing good about the Medina. Seriously. Think about it..... How is poor hygiene good? Or animal cruelty? Or disgusting smells? There's a very fine line between embracing culture and being subject to holiday hell. Perhaps I am just used to the finer things in life.. If this is you too -- avoid this place at all costs. You'll be thanking me in the end. I'm a very fair reviewer and would never lie about an experience. P.S - I could say so much more.... But you'll probably stop reading after a while and get bored. Those were my main issues and probably will be yours too. Just think... If you were in England and saw a kitten with a broken foot, it would make you feel sad right? Times that feeling by 100 when you visit this country (And I'm not even a cat person!!)"

However, what soured us on the Marrakech experience was that we bought an expensive tajine in what was supposed to be a reputable store in the medina. We did the usual negotiation and even managed to get a \"deal\" at 60% less than the original asking price. We thought we had just bought the most beautiful tajine. When we got home to Canada we really wanted to unpack our tajine to make sure it arrived safely after all the flights it had been on. Unfortunately, we were in for a big disappointment. It looks as though we were scammed. Now we know what happens when you are not paying enough attention and get caught up in the superficial beauty of a particular piece. The workers in the store were particularly keen to pack the tajine by themselves and away from our prying eyes. When we got the piece unpacked we could see that the red stones were in fact plastic and the colour had been rubbed off as the piece was moved through the various airports. It is also really apparent that the workmanship was nowhere close to the quality we had thought we were buying. How did this happen? We don't really know. We are not careless purchasers. We look carefully at what we are buying. We either missed the quality problems with this piece or the piece we thought we were buying was switched for a piece of junk. We are really disappointed, in ourselves, in the people who sold us this piece, in our guide for taking us to a place that would sell such shoddy products but mostly in ourselves. The medina is fascinating. I just wouldn't recommend paying big bucks for anything unless you can be absolutely sure of the quality."

I even kicked back a soccer ball to the delight of the local boys. In the morning I chatted with a group of lovely schoolgirls who giggled a lot. Never at any time was I afraid. My riad was off the beaten path so I had to walk it alone many times including at night. One day on my way back to my riad I noticed a crowd around a shop and stopped to investigate. I ended up drinking the most delicious fruit drink I ever had. It was made of fresh pineapple, strawberries, bananas, and kiwi for only fifty cents (US). I did buy one for another local senior and we stood there enjoying each other and our delicious drink. Keep your eyes open for these special gems!"

The local wares, the merchants and buyers, the back and forth of commerce. So true then it is of the Medina in Marrakech, made more impressive by the contrasts of commercial jets and luxury resorts surrounding this ancient marketplace. The history is as redolent as the smells, not all of them good as the donkeys and stalls contribute, but are quickly overwhelmed by cumin, cinnamon, jasmine, leather. The sounds, a tumultuous symphony of braying mules, vendors insisting entrance, cart wheels clattering, coins clinking, muezzins calling, fans whispering, the gut strings of sintirs thrumming, and hunter's horns blaring from the square. Two young men passed me in the tight alley. Dressed in traditional multicolored tasseled and fringed outfits with cone hats, I thought them acrobats from the circus. They were tea sellers. Men and women in colorful djellabas flowed by, working, shopping, their Darija dialect and French mellifluously blending as tourists dressed for comfort more than style portrayed an startling mix of cultures, and all descending into this twisting labyrinth that mixes spatters of sunlight with pools of darkness, colors sharp, smells pungent. Like a Berber carpet in an array of colors, so to the sights: hanging carcasses, poofs of lambskin, stacks of delft inscribed in arabesque poetry, herbs and hardware, Bedouin trade goods, African antiques, mounds of olives and unguents. Chatterers, bargainers, and beggars abound so, yes, the Medina is chaos, but controlled, comprehensible, and welcoming. My greatest find here was the sincere warmth of the folk. People make a market, and Marrakech's Medina is teeming with friendly faces. Do not be dissuaded from this place. Certainly, be aware of who you are and where you are, but do walk in history and be embraced by the Medina. You'll discover more than bargains."

Our guide took us to a high-end clothing store and then to a building that seemed to contain many craft stores. We got clothing, shoes and jewelry. A highlight was going to what we would probably call a Health Food store. We got tea, natural medicines, herbs, oils and soaps. We watched a demonstration (in the store) of argan oil being processed and got a massage. Everything in one place. We never could have found the place without our guide.

There, I said it. The Ugly: I arrived with cautious optimism and followed all the best practices of safe travel, while still trying to have a good time.

A real assault on the all the senses. Watch out for the Henna ladies (very aggressive - firmly extract yourself from their 'grip' otherwise you are unwittingly buying an expensive experience), and be careful not to take photos of the snake charmers unless you are prepared to pay handsomely for it. The local men glare lecherously which is unpleasant and reflects the objectivity with which they regard females, but there is a lightness and general joviality about the food sellers (and particularly the orange juice sellers) which compensates.

This is my take- and you have a different one, more power to you: This place was, at some point in history, an easy and exotic destination for the Western Traveler who wanted the ease of a place with French as an available language, a place as different from the East and the West and yet familiar with both, with a history making it more amenable to non-Muslim outsiders. Camels, souks, sand, spices\u2026. adventure. What is it now? To some of you who go, it\u2019s a quick jaunt from Europe to a place that is \u201cdifferent\u201d and yes \u2013 \u201cexotic\u201d in being that different. Good weather in winter, and beautiful hotels and riads that cater to your every need. Good food and rest and people waiting on you nonstop, your every wish their command. To others it will be the worst experience of your lifetime. This is not Egypt or Turkey. While those countries, if you try, and especially if you come from a non-Western heritage do offer the possibility of authentic experiences- there are no authentic experiences to be had in Marrakech other than being ripped off, abused and harassed. Any experience you THINK is authentic is not. It is constructed for you. It is Disneyland, it is theater, it is a good act. Just because the dirty streets of the medina, littered with trash, overrun with smells, and packed with interesting visions make you feel like you have stepped into an authentic world \u2013 rest assured, you have not. This is a city with no soul and no heart. It\u2019s a place that has sold itself, long ago \u2013 for money, and greed, and far worse, an underlying dislike and hatred of \u201cother.\u201d Where good people are raised to take pride in living with one goal \u2013 survival, by any means necessary, and yes, with an excessive greed. These are not a hospitable people, much as the pretense is there. You will make many friends in Marrakech, you will laugh, and be complimented, and invited. You will drink tea and cookies and hear endless beautiful stories. Listen to the stories in every corner, drink the tea, smile, shake hands, and be fully aware, its all smoke and mirrors\u2026. Not just when you are being conned into purchases by your close friend, your inn keeper, this person and that - but around every corner, in every action you take. The rest of the world is poor too, and the rest of the world needs to survive on tourists and outsiders but few in the middle east or east go about it as brazenly as those in this place. In my experience, a genuine soul is difficult if not impossible to find, and it is not worth the effort, even if they are there. These people are too good at acting, they are bred to put on a show for you - of humility, of honesty, of caring. The place is perhaps worth one visit, to experience the history, and yes, to experience the vile and soulless experience of the medina, its souks, and its inhabitants- most of whom hate Westerners with a passion- no matter what they say. Almost every kindness, every bit of \u2018joy\u2019 in this soulless place is constructed. It is a heartless and empty place, of poor people who need and grab, and of wealthy and greedy merchants who only want more, and more and more, with not an iota of the supposed tenets of the religion they supposedly live by.Separate from all this is also another world, of the highest population of drug addicts of most cities in this part of the planet-- family men who bring their kids out to get their hits - lost souls wandering streets ill and hungry- and much of the darkness that goes with that -- at night in the medina. The Northern Medina is especially where this takes on an ugly face.I will never forget my many experiences in this city, and I am glad to have had them. I will remember these characters for a lifetime. But you better have thick skin or blind eyes. Fortunately most who venture here never open their eyes to see the reality of the place.I will also never go back."

It covers quite a fair bit and one can easily get lost inside the maze of alleyways, shops selling trinkets, salons, cafes, tailors, Riads and the general hustle and bustle. I had the pleasure of staying in the Medina in Riad Laksiba so got to wonder around parts of the Kasbah area. There are many attractions within the Medina and it's somewhat safe. You don't get hassled as much - the streets are labeled in english so you work your way quite easily. Its full of life! So worth a visit."

There was very little pressure from stall holders; once we said no we were left alone. The only problem is you find that you are repeating yourself, but this is purely because the place is filled to the brim with market stalls.We avoided riding on a Caleche until late in the day and I have to say that was the best part of the Medina trip, it's great value for money (250 DM) and we were taken on an extensive hour long tour of the area around the Medina and Royal Palace. (DON 'T TAKE PICTURES PALACE).All in all a great adventure and a must for anyone visiting the area."

I loved it but was also glad to leave after a few hours walking throught the maze of poorly marked alleys. We did not get lost but were able to find our way by speaking French with locals when we had questions. We were surprised that the street vendors were not as agressive as we expected. We understand that they make their living by selling so we were not too bothered by their tactics. Prices and quality vary so you need to look and compare before buying. Watch out for friendly men who want to show you \"something special\" or help you find your way. We had several approach us and declined their offers as one was trying to direct us towards the tanneries and another claimed he worked at our Riad and wanted to take us to a \"very special\" carpet auction. We were never afraid anywhere in Marrakech but did were careful not to trust those who offered help when they really just wanted our money.We found the Medina in Essaouira much easier to navigate as the streets are more or less set-up on a grid pattern. We liked shopping better in Essaouira and found better deals than in Marrakech. The vendors were more friendly in Essaouira and since it is much smaller than Marrakech it is easier to recall the location of a stall you like. Enjoy your trip to the Medina and just say no \"thank you\" and walk away if you feel you are being pressured to buy."

And it's a completely different world to the western civilised ways we are so used to. I beg you, do not buy an item from here at the first price you're given - in fact 1/3 of the price they offer if where you should pitch it. If that seller won't come down - walk away - three stalls down you'll see the same thing. Be wary of cheap leathers and really inspect the bags, poofs etc before committing. If I'm honest; I'd go here for the fun of it and not to purchase as it's london prices! Also - don't tell them where you're from! If you say England - you'll get the England price tag ;-).

You will be approached by many locals giving you advise where to go? What do I recommend to make your life more easier and less stressful! Get a young kid as a guide pay him a few euros it really worth it! And it's saves you time and peace of mind. I do not recommend taking any of the the horse rides as I saw that many of the horses are not treated well, and are hurt some of them the legs were bleeding. The same goes for taking pictures with the poor monkeys in the heat it's an attraction that I just don't share. I can imagine this poor animals under the heat of 45 degrees with the asphalt melting under their legs. I wonder wether they get any rest."

Shortly after, a badly wrapped package arrived. It contained a poorly made copy of our \"antique\" window, covered with some nasty smelling shoe-polish. We returned the package to the store. The owner did not bother to pick it up from the post office till the time to claim our money from the bank (two billing periods) has legally expired. The owner ignored our emails and a letter. At the end - no money, no merchandise for us. Stay away from the store and its owner - Mahamed El Eemrani. Looks like he knew what he was doing and pulled this trick more than once."

The worst things are working out how to deal with shop owners when you don't want to buy anything and the motorbikes that nearly knock you over as they speed through the narrow laneways."

On the first day it was a little hectic dodging mopeds and bicycles but got used to that quite quickly. We would spend our days wandering the souks making the odd purchase here and there (after bartering which at times was hilarious) and ate in different places every day and night. The vibe was good the people on the whole were friendly and not too overbearing or pushy - just had to be able to say no quite firmly which was respected and we always felt safe. Oh and the weather was amazing mid 30's the whole time. Would do it it again but only for a couple of days and would definitely like to explore more of Morocco."

He showed us the behind the scenes - how the Medina is organized around the Mosque, school, Hammam, artisans etc. We saw the artisans making the products, the baker making the bread for the entire community of each quartier, the worker throwing wood chips on the fire to heat the Hammams. It helped understand how the Medina is structured and how the community works and lives. Very interesting."

Marrakech's \"tourist-fresh-meat-cash-cow\" mentality was off the charts compared to the other touristy shopping bazaars around the world (e.g. chatuchak, night markets, etc). From restaurants literally grabbing you for patronage to performers demanding tips because you took a photo in their general direction to shop owners blocking the exits... it was a pretty insane and definitely an experience. To save future visitors time/bargain-fatigue, i got a cliche tourist morocco t-shirt for 40DH (started at 120DH), using the walking off method. While i'm not sure if this is the cheapest price, i guess it would be a good reference. I love picking up knick-knacks (magnets, pouches, doodads) and found the best prices (ie the store owners listed the price at a fair amount) and the best place it seemed for that was near where the Jemaa el Fna square turns into the markets. As a male, i saw it on the whole as a different cultural experience, but my three female travel companions were rather put off by it all. It is a interesting and fascinating place in its own right with some good bargains to be found (after A LOT of haggling), and no regrets having visited there. Wandering during the day was hotter, but less hectic as compared to the evening where human traffic balloons up."

There is genuinely not much to see in Marrakesh and its unwelcoming demand for money when we initial got lost in the souks made me feel vulnerable and threatened!

Our tourist guide told us to always offer less than half the price so you can go up until they finally agree for half the original price, thanks Mustapha for that tip. Make sure you dine in one of the many terraces overlooking the Medina, seeing the sunset while having a nice meal right in the middle of the commotion is priceless...Our kids had a great time, there were something for everyone to enjoy, the snakes for our 6 years old son, the ladies doing the henna for our daughters (11 & 15), the many games, the small stores, everything was fascinating to us.

The local people are quite friendly and we enjoyed getting lost in the Souk which is really huge and shopping paradise (if your luggage limit permits).

There is so much traffic inside the medina: so many cars and motorcycles, and they're not really the latest model so they're all leaving behind clouds of thick, black smog.

We spent 4 days in Marrakech -- all of which was in the Medina and I still feel like I did not uncover all her secrets. Once you get used to saying no to people, you really do become more comfortable. We unfortunately speak neither French nor Arabic, so communicating and getting around was a little tricky. Overall I have to say I completely LOVED it. The Medina was built to be a maze. You are not supposed to feel comfortable there as an outsider. By day 2 I knew my way around -- but keep in mind that we walked miles and miles learning it. You can totally get by without doing that -- we did it because we wanted to. Accounts of not taking out your map etc. are totally true. If you look like you don't know what you are doing - -a local will \"help\" you -- just be prepared to pay them. And no matter what you pay, be prepared for them to tell you it is not enough. Learn a couple key phrases in Arabic and French. Especially \"no thank you\", \"how do I get here\", \"right\" and \"left\". The people there are extremely friendly. As a woman, I was mostly ignored. My husband got FAR more attention than I did. Merchants -- especially in the big square -- would put their arms around him and try to lead him into their booths. No one likes their picture taken here. As a photographer, this was difficult for me. I had to really learn to be sneaky and quick. If you buy something, the merchant will let you take as many pictures as you want. Go prepped for an experience you'll not get anywhere else and you will be happy. Also, be prepared to take a break every few hours. Find a nice \"Salon de The\", review your map, and begin again. You will seriously love it."

Why do the authorities allow scooters to travel down narrow pedestrian walkways. They come up behind you and for some reason think they have priority.

Don't get me wrong this is definitely not for the faint hearted, you have people calling from their shops and you have to constantly dodge motorcycles and bikes, but that's part of the appeal!Although sellers called to you from their shops, it was not every shop and it was all good natured with \"Asda price\" being heard regularly. I never felt threatened or at risk from pick pockets, keep your money in a safe pocket and you shouldn't have to worry about that anyway.There are lots of cafes and restaurants to try, and everyone wants to sit on the roof terrace, so look for a place with empty seats before climbing all those stairs!

            "review": "The sounds, smells and sights of the Medina will stay with me forever. This is the second time I have been to Marrakesh (the first was 10 years ago with a female friend). This time I went with my husband. The Medina was vibrant but I have to say there are a few cautious tales to be told. First of all, there are the official Government guides who have badges and wear striped dish-dashes (generally but not exclusively). Then, there seemed to be the alternative guides who were older men, smartly dressed, who led you to believe that they were long term residents of the Medina and just wanted to help you because they loved their city. They will then casually give you directions to a certain place (usually the Berber Centre in the Kasbah) and then they will \"disappear\". However, just as you are walking past the Berber Centre they will appear again and tell you that the Centre is only open for one day because the Berbers only come down from the mountain villages every so often for a festival in the town and they are heading back tomorrow. WRONG! Approximately 75% of the inhabitants in Marrakesh are in fact Berbers. I'm sure the Berber Centre was interesting but primarily you will be subjected to hard sell and your friendly local Marrakeshi gentlemen will be looking for a healthy commission or a tip. You will also find that you will be told by residents of the Medina and Kasbah that certain attractions are closed today - because they want you to go with them elsewhere for commission or a tip, or that a route or alleyway is shut off and that you will have to take an alternative route - and they will show you the way and that they don't want money until you say goodbye. Then, you will be asked for paper Dirhams or Euros. Small change is not acceptable in any currency and they will make a fuss. In my view 10 Dirhams (about 75 pence) is a very adequate tip and my husband and I would not be bullied. So, make sure you have plenty of small change in the local currency when out and about in the Medina. Whilst I appreciate that many of the residents of Marrakesh are very poor by European standards, their behaviour really can be rather wearing. I have lived and worked in the Middle East in several countries and I go to Egypt regularly on holiday and usually love the Arab bartering mentality and have loads of fun but I found that locals' behavious in Marrakesh could sometimes be quite menacing. The taxi drivers too will not have meters and so you have to agree a price before you get in the vehicle. One taxi driver wanted way too much to take us to the Marjorelle Gardens, wait and return us to our hotel. He tried to tell me that it was 40 kms away (it's actually less than 3 from the Medina). If you don't want to be ripped off, have a map and do your homework first. A clean, more luxurious taxi will charge more, which is fair enough, but many yellow taxis are not really roadworthy and have no working seatbelts but want to charge the same price. A taxi from the Medina to the airport should cost about 150 dirhams maximum, but you will probably be asked for twice that amount.Having had a good moan, the souks are amazing and fascinating. You will probably get lost but you can also buy some bargains. Beware of buying Argan Oil. Try to buy from an official Herbalist. The same applies for saffron. There are ways of telling whether you have the genuine thing or not - tips available if required. The tanneries in the eastern quarter of the Medina are interesting but very smelly. This area is one of the poorest in the Medina and you will be bothered more than in other areas. The Marrakesh Museum, Bahia Palace and Saidian Tombs are all worth a visit but in themselves are not jaw-dropping spectacles. Jab el Fnaa Square itself is different in the daytime to the night time. During the day, you have snake charmers, henna painters, fruit and spice stalls. In the evening, it transforms into a wonderful open air restaurant. The food is freshly cooked but no alcohol is available at these pop-up restaurants. There are also many groups gathered to perform evocative drumming. Only a few restaurants serve alcohol in the Medina as they have to be 80 metres from a mosque before they can get a licence - and there are a number of mosques in the Medina so it could be tricky. The Nouvelle Cite restaurants mostly serve alcohol. Non-muslims are not allowed into the Koutoubia Mosque but the surrounding gardens are lovely. The carriage rides are a good way of seeing the Medina but we didn't go on one this time and so I have no idea what the prices are. The horses are mostly in good condition. Don't try to take photos of snake charmers, water sellers or some quirky stalls unless you are prepared to pay a tip. The first time I visited Marrakesh there was a stall selling false teeth - a must for a picture - but I couldn't find it this time. There are also men with monkeys wearing nappies which they will try to put on your person. Yuk. Beware also if you don't like snakes because the snake charmers will often produce snakes from their pockets and try to hand them to you. If you want to stay in a Riad, make sure of its location. Many in the Medina/Kasbah are not accessible by vehicles and you could easily get lost in the alleyways dragging your baggage with you. My best advice would be to find one near Jab al Fnaa Square. My final suggestion is to get a good guide book - the Lonely Planet or Rough Guides are really helpful and do a bit of homework before your trip to get the maximum benefit from your stay."

We had visited Tangier before but this was our first visit to Marrakech and I have to say that we were disappointed \u2013 it did not live up to expectations. Positives:- Although there is a lot to see, you only need about 3 days before running out of things to visit. However, there are some good trips out of town to the coast or the Atlas Mountains. We hired a car and found the driving easy, except during rush hour in Marrakech, when you could say it is \u201cinteresting\u201d. - As long as you enjoy walking, everything within the Medina is within walking distance.- There are some great sights just outside the Medina, notably the Jardin Majorelle \u2013 a must see. - It feels safe, although if women do not want to be stared at, they need to dress modestly. - Most people speak good English and French is the second language, which most people appear to understand. - Although it is pretty grotty and by the end of each day there is trash everywhere, the locals clean up at night and the streets look relatively clean every morning. - Some of the Moorish architecture is pretty amazing and although it is not in the same league as that in the Alcazar in Seville or the Alhambra Palace in Granada. However, the entrance fees to historical sited and museums are very cheap (typically 10 \u2013 20 DH). - To their credit, the locals appear to work incredibly long hours to earn very little money. - The locals love it if you make the effort to say \u201cshukran\u201d (thank you). - If you have a decent guide book and are a good map reader, you can get around easily without taking part in a tour. Otherwise, expect to be \u201cherded like sheep\u201d and waste time in places you would rather not bother with. We took time to browse. Negatives:- As in many third world countries, the contrasts between the \u201chave\u2019s\u201d and \u201chave not\u2019s\u201d are very evident. There is extreme poverty in places, with numerous beggars and people living in appalling conditions. Yet behind the facades there are some beautiful buildings and riads or people driving flashy cars. Have some coins in your pocket to give to those who obviously need them but beware of scammers. - The poor animals have an even harder life. There are decrepit looking cats everywhere (which is probably why we did not see any rats) and the locals treat their donkeys, mules and horses appallingly. Most look as though they are starving and they have horrible sores from the harnesses. And the drivers are not averse to using their whips. - We were surprised by how expensive the hotels/riads and (safe) restaurants were \u2013 approximately 50% more than in the UK or US. - There seems to be huge over-supply of goods. You will see a dozen stores next to each other all trying to sell the same stuff but very few buyers. How on earth people make a living there is a mystery. - Wherever you go you get hassled by people trying to sell you something. If you show interest in anything in the souk, expect a \u201chard sell\u201d. If you are just passing through or do not want to buy anything, the advice is to look ahead, avoid eye contact and keep walking. \u201cNon merci\u201d is an essential part of your vocabulary. - You need to negotiate for most things, including taxis. The first line of negotiation is often, \u201cHow much do you want to pay?\u201d Do some research on what things cost. If you really do want to buy something, I would suggest taking a trip out of town (e.g., to Essaouira) where everything is a fraction of the price and the prices are usually displayed.- Don\u2019t try to take a picture of the snake charmers or any other short of show. Someone will swoop on you demanding money. - Beware young men who offer to show you the way. They will either be taking you to their uncle\u2019s spice shop or will take you the long way round and expect to be paid. If you pay them, they will then argue that it\u2019s not enough. \u201cNon merci\u201d again!So overall, Marrakech is probably worth a visit but you do not need more than a couple of days there."

As frequent visitors to Turkey and Egypt, my partner and I are both well versed in trading and how to deal with the 'pushy' sales ideas often displayed whilst in these areas. We expected more of the same pestering and badgering and this place was almost European in feel in that regard. In Egypt or Turkey, for example, 99% of people will pester and harangue you to buy... Here, maybe 15% do the same, the remainder will try, but a simple \"No, but thank you\" sees the end of the matter! Bartering is simple.... If you actually want to buy something (and there is PLENTY of things to buy!), ask the price and offer 1/3 of that price. By the time you settle on a price, normally around 50% of the starting price, you should be about right. I even pushed my luck by taking out 100dr and telling a shop keeper I couldn't buy or Barter as I only had 100dr for a 600dr tagine.... Somehow, he agreed to the sale, so, as cheeky as that was, it shows there are massive bargains to be found if you are determined to be a little blunt, but polite, in dealing with traders! The place is a joy to watch. Arrive at about 4pm and just sit, relax, drink coffee (or tea ha, ha) and watch the place come alive. It's one great life experience. Food within the Medina, on the stalls, is fantastic, although, personally, I didn't risk the sea food ;-) Much cheaper than restaurant prices, just as good and, again, a life experience. Women, keep your hands in your pockets, as the women offering henna tattoos will grab a hand and just start doing one whilst you walk, then demand money. They seem to last about 24 hours, then fade. Even if you actually want one, they are a waste of time and they try to charge about 300dr for them. My partner and I ate 3 courses and had drinks for 140dr!

This Medina was the first one we encountered on our trip to Morocco, and its safe to say we threw ourselves in the deep end in doing so. Marrakech is known to be a tourist hub therefore the shopkeepers/locals in the Medina can be quiet full on to handle with their schemes of getting money from you. but at the same time we really enjoyed our time in the medina and stayed in a hostel in the centre of it. We felt safe walking around (couple in mid 20s) and we quickly learnt that a firm NO to people following you for money sets them on their way and you just have to be firm, sounds harsh but ignoring the people coming up to you on the street is the best way to deal with them, do not be friendly or polite as they will follow you and you will not be able to shake them. Really enjoyed the street food set up on the main square each night, this place is a must!"

I did it once in Delhi and had to repeat it now in Marrakech to please my wife. Always accompanied by a good and knowledgeable guide indicated by the hotel we surfed the crowds looking for bargains and unique pieces. Most clothing stores claim to have exclusive hand made models that can be seen in the next stores. The glass, wooden pieces, boxes, tea pots, silver items, are all the same in most shops. We did buy some antiques but not sure about them.They always want to bargain at the end giving a global discount forcing you to buy more than one piece. Bargain each piece. You may get at least 50% of the initial price. We found most articles even after bargaining expensive but maybe because we were tired we end up buying. We went 2 days as our guide always had some need to see stores. Just the last one was worthwhile for women clothing with exclusive models. I do not want to advertise but if you look for the best in local traditional fashion clothing you have to look for the big name in Marrakech. Did see some cartons written \"made in china\" that to be fair could be for merchandise other than the one sold at Medina. Beggers were not a problem. Streets were considerably clean. The general mess is organized and you are able to walk freely, just keep the right end side of the street and watch for the motorcycles. Do not go without an official guide indicated by the hotel. Also enter in any store you feel like not just on the one your guide tells you to.Regardless of the above Medina is a must to see. We did not eat there just had coffee and tea at the Ryads which are worth seeing."

But I must admit, that the culture of the Moroccan people, at every market place, made it by far the best experience of my least favorite travel activity!The Moroccan people in general are a very 'hospitable' culture - they take great care in making sure that everyone is greeted with a welcoming salutation, and expect (deserve) a gracious reply in turn. This also applies in the medinas - where their job is certainly to try to entice you to buy their wares, but the experience is far better when the culture is to be polite and gracious during the traditional 'haggling' negotiations. You will find that even if you cannot come to an agreement on price, most vendors will still respectfully bid you a good day. Be advised: there are people who will offer to guide you, and expect payment for the service (even if they say they won't). I found it helpful and worth the few dollars, to get a guide to take us to exactly what we were looking for. Of course, they will take you to their friends and relatives - but you can stop along the way with them to look at whatever you want, and my experience was that they would help you to negotiate a fair price. A guide is also the quickest way out of the maze of the medina - saving you the time and stress of being lost if you are on a schedule, or frightened by the crowds.The marketplace came to life as the sunlight grew dimmer - the crowd quickly grew, the hawking of the vendors calling you to dine at their stalls grew louder, and the energy became more dynamic. There is everything at the medina - freshly squeezed citrus drinks, charming young men trying to entice you to dine in their stalls making fresh foods, vendors with all manner of things for sale, and even the exotic experience of snake charmers and monkeys to pose with to scare friends and family back at home!"

We visited as part of a tour group under two scenarios (a) Night guided tour where hundreds of thousands of people were milling, eating, being entertained by so many things. The noise, the buzz, the crowds, the sellers (of whatever you wanted or didn't want), the half terrified feeling that you'd be lost, coupled with the thrill of being with so many people moving in all different directions and in all different modes -on foot, on bike, in car, on horse. The smells and the sounds, as well as what the eyes could see,was an amazing mixture. Even the smoke rising from the cooking of the meats seemed to produce not only a wonderful aroma but further mystique. As a group, we couldn't believe that we weren't all tied together to ensure we didn't lose each other but somehow, with the local guide, we all emerged. It was exhilarating!(b) Day visit. As a group we were returned to the Medina to \"look or buy\" for 1.5 hours. Even though there are individual stalls, where we went I observed that they were very organised. A \"runner\" relayed to other stall owners what we were interested in and as additional information was gained, this was passed on so that the next stall owner could offer a bit more. Fortunately we had a reference point for price (from a shop) and used this as our top price. I hadn't bargained before - but I loved it - and of course I bought things that I don't really need! This was a great experience. Hint: be on your guard all the time; don't take photos of the locals unless you ask otherwise they will demand money; if you get a cab agree a fixed price before you get in the cab."

Yes, it can be busy, dirty and smelly. Yes, you might take a wrong turning but the experience is unforgettable.These are poor people working hard to make a living but without exception we found them to be polite, helpful and honest. A few precautions; Don't hire a guide - they will steer you to a relative's shop.Don't accept offers of directions - even when they say they don't want money - they do. A favourite opening line is, \"Hello, don't you recognise me? I work in the Riad - I've just changed clothes. Are you looking for spices/carpets/jewellery/ etc today? I can get you a special price.\"Do take a compass with you. That way you'll be able to navigate the narrow passageways without help. [TOP TIP]Do stop and look at the goods but remember souks are market places and you'd expect to be approached by a sales assistant in a city clothing store, wouldn't you?Do learn how to politely escalate your refusal. Start by making a tutting sound with your tongue as you quickly flick your head up and back. This is how the locals say No and works most of the time.If the attention persists, say La Shokran - No thanks. If that doesn't work say Khalas (the kh is pronounced like the Scottish ch sound in loch) - that means Enough! Hold up your right hand at the same time (never your left). Last resort is to shout Shouma - Shame on you! We never needed more than the tutting.Do dress modestly. Women wearing scarves on their heads get less attention.Try not to shake hands with the traders. Arab people hold hands longer than westerners during a handshake, but this is also a clever way to gently steer you towards their shop. Smile and tut instead.Do ask if you can take photographs - even if it is just the goods, not the vendor.Remember that the price of taxis goes up when it's raining but you'll still be able to cut a deal.Allow a couple of hours at least and enjoy the whole experience."

I would advise that the visitor should expect 'great bargaining' instead. The prices are not important, really. You have traveled for something unique, so what price can you set for the unique? And the quality of materials and the workmanship are just as unique. I would encourage every visitor to explore and visit the artisans in their shops, converse, sense; this is where a great deal is made.As for bargaining and dealing; you are in the center of the world's best sales people. One ten-yr-old boy we dealt with could converse fluently in at least the five languages of our group, shifting from one to another effortlessly. He was polite to a fault and engaging; no fear of the waters he navigated. The price you will pay might not impress your friends when you get home, but you will have dealt and lightly haggled and bargained boltly,.... and that is a story of great worth in the telling!"

The colour of the fabrics are amazing, especially for the women. Spices are everywhere to tease your nose.  Livestock are sold live to the locals and you see many a local on foot or bike carrying the live chickens or rabbits home. We even saw a moped stocked up trays of eggs. It flew past us in a flash. You would not see anything so extraordinary here in the UK.There are plenty of stalls selling food and drinks. Mint tea is the usual drink and we had plenty of it. It was divine. As usual there were the usual pedlars of all ages plying their wares and ladies prepared to pain your hands intricately with henna.There are streets after streets full of stalls of all kinds. You could spend days just searching the mass of metal, leather, fabric, food, spice, and the like. It could suck you up so easily as there was just so much to see.Prepare to barter for your goods, don't just accept the first figure given to you. We came back with good quality items and at good prices all because my husband successfully bartered the prices down. Would we go again, yes we would as there is much we still have not seen."

Although we said no, they still followed us for awhile but soon gave up. We were also approached by several women trying to grab our hands to decorate them with henna tattoos, but a firm 'no thank you' and they left us alone. There is a lot of hustle & bustle in the Medina which might not suit everybody as it can be a culture shock for some, but it's all part of it's charm.

Because on my last visit I found the overall ambience quite exciting, different and lively from European adventure, and also to that found in Tunisia / Turkey. But on my first trip I did stay in a Riadh, centre of the Medina / Soukh, and was one of very few Europeans seen in that area in general and even had over filled rubbish bins and a tied up donkey next to the entrance thereof. Genuine fly ridden food shops alongside the very narrow streets upon which one walked with trepidation, mopeds everywhere missing the pedestrian by centimetres. Whilst the air is filled with the aeromatica of open markets, fresh fish or meat shops, ( also fly ridden) cooking and so on, the acrid moped smoke and motor noise everywhere rather detracts from the pleasure.But the stalls/shops/bazaar? Piles of poor product, nothing less than rubbish, poor quality offerings hanging from shop frames. Just stopping to look, or even walking by attracts the vendor to you, \"Francais, Deutsch, Eeengleesh, I spik, I spik - you buy you buy\" and if you're really unlucky one will be grabbed by the arm with similar words with an attempt to drag one into dark recesses wherever. As to the leisurely examination of goods, forget it. \" you have money, you buy, finest camel leather you look,\" when frankly better stuff can be bought in Leeds Market! Cheaper! As to the touristy phrases to the effect of enjoying bartering for a bargain, well, find out for yourself. Dont hold the breath unless you just enjoy the useless.Then there are the street entertainers, snake charmers and the like. Be aware of the viciously thrusted fez in front of the nose demanding money at the mere hint of a camera shot. Sat harmlessly with a coffee, amateurish acrobats often begin throwing themselves about in front of the cafe for a few minutes before the ubiquitous fez was produced and shaken \" for ze accerobattes\".Ignoring them was a good strategy - from behind the cafe table face stuck in the emptying cup.On trips into the wilds, when stopping in the remotest places the inevitable trader seemed to pop out from behind a sand dune or rock formation as if by arrangement. Whilst there is so much more to tell of this, keeping a clear head there is genuinely a lot to see of a different culture - but for the first timer the place is geared up to one thing, and one thing only, treating the tourist as an idiot, forcing the unwary to buy poor stuff from curiosity or fear, and charging as much as they can for utter crap.2014 I am treating myself to a fine all inclusive hotel, and intend to enjoy the country and overall culture without giving the Denizens of the Medina the pleasure of ripping me off!"

The air pollution in the medina of marrakech made it difficult to fully enjoy the atmosphere. It feels like a pretty unhealthy place. (dirty, polluted). People here were pushier (more desperate) than in the other Medinas we experienced in Morocco. We did like the activity and bustle of the medina and getting lost in winding old streets, but felt so overwhelmed by the air quality and dodging being run over by motorbikes, that we ended up leaving a day early to get out to rural Morocco. Jemaa El Fna is pretty amazing at night and shouldn't be missed. We also liked seeing the setup in Jemaa El Fna in the late afternoon, as food vendors started preparing for the lively evening. Our meal in Jemaa El Fna at night was delicious and choosing a restaurant was a fun experience.In terms of the souqs, we were glad we saved our shopping for Fes and Chefchaouen, as they seemed to have some more authentic products and less slightly pushy salespeople. (especially in chefchaouen). I recommend really wandering out into the less traveled areas of the medina where fewer tourists wander. Those are the areas that we enjoyed the most."

Aggressive sales everywhere, people grabbing at you to visit their store, kids intentionally pointing you in the wrong direction so that their friend can then \"guide\" you and demand tips. It's all very unpleasant overall. I wish I hadn't come back to ruin my memories of this place."

Try the morning option first if like me it is your first visit as it was much calmer and easier to negotiate your way around. I went twice in the morning around 10am. We never took a map or a guide and just went with the flow. At night, the square really comes to life. The sky is lit by the sky flier toys, the floor is adorned with the beautiful lanterns and LED windup toys. The sounds of traditional singers and story tellers fill the air alongside the hubbub of the crowds. It seriously is a world of its own!There are lots of shops selling the same thing; traditional gowns, belts, bags etc. There were also some strange and uncomfortable sights like animals skins and dead snakes the deeper we went into the souks. Plus you do get a lot of \u2018traffic\u2019 in the paths so be prepared to repeatedly move out of the way. If you don\u2019t fancy exploring or are intimidated by the square just go for the refreshing fresh orange juice which is an absolute bargain at 4Dh! There are rows of sellers near the exit.Haggling is a strange experience. Some traders offer extortionate prices (10 times the actual amount) and others will offer a fair deal straight away so you never have any consistency. I took a currency converter so I wouldn\u2019t get ripped off and it was the best thing I did. Think about it, why pay a ridiculous price for something in Marrakech if you would not buy it for that much in your home country? Also there is a currency exchange place near the square which offers decent rates so you can change your money there.One thing I would say it try to use the loo at your hotel before you travel ladies. They have the \u2018squat\u2019 toilets where you have the pleasure of paying a dirham to use their hole in the ground (take your own paper!)."

This place is great to go around and they have pretty much everything there but know the value of something before you decide to buy as prices are just what the vendor is feeling at the time. From my experience there were better deals to be had for most items further out from the medina. If you do want to try your hand at haggling it can be fun but make sure to know what you want to pay for the item first and don't be afraid to walk away. The other thing to point out is that it can get very tedious with vendors trying to constantly sell something to you, always asking to look at this or that and this really stops you from ever really wanting to stop moving to look at anything as they will pounce as soon as you even glance at an item."

Its not true - whatever you see, there will be other places that sell exactly the same thing and you may find better elsewhere. The best advice I can give you is to say that you bought something similar the day before so you really aren't that interested and don't want to insult the shopkeeper - then you can offer them the silliest prices - bargaining is fun, but they are the masters and you cannot win at their game. I have seen things on the internet since I have come home that are cheaper than the things I am having shipped from Marrakech. I have just put it down to experience and enjoying playing the game. Having travelled to the Arab market in Jerusalem many times, the Medina was not a culture shock but I have never witnessed such terrible treatment of the animals that we walked past including monkeys on chains and half starved donkeys. It was very sad to see. Please do not encourage the people who own monkeys, snakes etc to keep them by paying to have photos with these poor animals.We took a guide with us so we didn't get lost but there were plenty of tourists around without guides who looked perfectly happy just wondering around. I thought that my teenage children, especially my daughter would get a lot of hassle but I was pleasantly surprised that everyone was very respectful and polite to us. If you look too closely into a shop or stall or point at something the shopkeeper with rush out to get you to come and look at everything in his shop. It can get quite irritating but don't be shy to say no thank you. The guide told us that we should ignore them.I will definitely go back but I will go out armed with a much better idea of how much things are worth."

If you are worried about getting lost (which we did a few times) then hire a guide but we didn't bother. You don't get as much hassle as some of the reviews I have read. My tips are - don't stop and look too long if you are not interested in buying, just be polite and say 'no thanks' if you are not intersted and never take pictures if you have not asked permission or are not prepared to pay for the privelidge, in particular the snake chamers and the men with silly hats.

The main square was interesting but you sort of felt that the whole place is geared up as a showcase to tourists. The Souks are colourful and yes there are snake charmers in the main big square. Personally I would have given the main square a miss and spent more time in the streets around the medina or even in the Menara gardens.The streets of the medina have similar wares to shop that are available in the Souk- I bought lots of earrings.

However, this ancient area is difficult to navigate due to shop owner excessive aggressiveness including night time restaurant hawkers. There is no such thing as 'just looking' or comparative price shopping you may be accustomed to back home. You are greeted you as you pass each shop in an attempt to get you to come into a stall. If you step in the owner now expects you to buy. All the high pressure antics took the leisure and pleasure out of shopping for me. The quality of the goods ranges from low to mediocre. Prices are never marked, the bartering is harrowing. After one purchase at an agreed upon price the seller was visibly annoyed, making me very uncomfortable! I disliked the whole game. I feel with most purchases I way overpaid for junk. It is impossible to establish fair market value. Guaranteed: whatever you buy you will see somewhere else for less. Frustrating. If you can tolerate all this perhaps your experience will be better than mine. Trying to discreetly take photos often raised ire, even if I just wanted a shot of a shop. I would never visibly point my camera at someone. One time I was taking a photo of a sales cart and the owner began berating me. Lucky for me a passing tour Moroccan guide intervened and smoothed the situation over but I was still left with a very bad feeling. Turns out the cart owner wanted me to ask permission and charge me for the opportunity! I feel merchants were not good ambassadors for their country. All the games and inveigling and constant badgering became tiring. My one week experience there left me very dissatisfied. My best tactics, which I recommend, were to never make eye contact with a shop owner, walk by quickly enough to see the goods, ignore all comments and stop in only when you are ready to purchase or have the fortitude to walk away impervious to the pressure. Twice locals helped negotiate a fair price for me. Local residents were always friendly and helpful.It is very difficult to know if you are buying genuine made in Morocco vs made in China. Be wary.I have traveled in many third world countries experiencing comfort, mutual respect absent of the hassles I encountered throughout my three week stay in this country."

You haven't been to Morocco unless you visit a medinah, and this one is as good as it gets."

            "review": "Fascinating but Mopeds Should be Banned. This is a fascinating place to visit with its Medina, history, culture and multitude of great restaurants to sample. At first sight the Medina can appear to be scruffy, at times an awful conglomeration but always full of life, colour and that real sense of what Morocco is all about.We visited in December for 10 days and warmed to the place very quickly. You have to get over the poverty and squalor that lie behind the Medina because then you can see a proud people with a history and vibrancy that is enchanting. This is a devout Muslim country and you will find there are some restaurants that do not serve alcohol. Open signs of affection are frowned upon and most of the mosques are closed to non Muslims. There are hosts of vendors in small kiosks or shops in the Medina offering their wares which range from wood carvings to ornate silver d\u00e9cor for the most extravagant of homes. We bought some beautiful wooden tissue boxes made from lemon tree and cedar to the most intricate design. See below.Whilst the international hotels are located in the modern (French built) area of the city outside the old city walls, there are literally thousands of small hotels or Riads in the Medina. If you want to experience the real Marrakech this is the area to stay in. There are prices to suit everyone and it can cost as little as \u00a320 a night right up to \u00a3200 or more. A feature of most Riads and indeed many restaurants is that what looks like an innocuous door or fa\u00e7ade, opens up to reveal a palatial interior. See my review of Le Coq Berbere.Walking through the Medina can be a bit daunting. You will be regularly stopped and encouraged into a shop or a \u2018helpful\u2019 guide will take it upon himself to explain where everything is in the Medina. This usually ends up in you being taken to a shop to buy something. They all have to make a living I suppose but it can be a bit irritating. Be polite but firm if you are approached and just say no thank you. The other point to make is that there is a constant flow of donkeys, bikes, mopeds and sometimes cars in the narrow streets of the Medina. By far the worst are the moped riders, some of whom drive way too fast in such a confined space. They come at you from all angles and expect you to get out of the way. You have to get used to the fumes as well because most of the Medina is covered and the moped fumes just hang in a blue pall, so pollution is quite bad. That\u2019s the bad side of things but they are far outweighed by the attractions of the Medina itself.Eventually you will make your way to Place Jemma El Fna, the massive square in Marrakech where traders, storytellers and all manner of people gather to ply their trade. In daytime it is less well populated with mainly fruit sellers and juice makers plus the odd snake charmer and dancer. Beware! If you so much as point a camera in their direction, they will pester you for money and some I saw get quite irate with a tourist who didn\u2019t want to contribute. At night there are stalls selling spices, street food, clothes, shoes, toys and all manner of tourist gifts. If you want to dine al fresco with the locals and you like fish, go to stall number 14 where you can order fish and vegetables for just a few Dirham, eat with your hands and be given a piece of kitchen roll to clean up. It\u2019s quite an experience. There are numerous bars overlooking the square with roof top balconies that let you see the panoply of activity below. It is well worth doing. Travelling around Marrakech is best done by the Petite Taxis, small usually run down old bangers that are relatively cheap. You do need to agree a price for your destination but it is so obvious you are a tourist and I\u2019m afraid like many tourist cities you will be charged a tourist price. We proved this by sharing a taxi with a local and the journey was only 9 dirham whereas the same journey the previous day had cost 70 dirham or about \u00a36. It\u2019s still cheap but not as cheap as the locals get it.Bartering in the souks and Medina shops generally is expected. If you want to buy wooden handicraft or indeed any handicrafts try asking for advice on where to go from your Riad manager. We were introduced to a carpenter who was a real find. My wife and I bought four highly decorative wooden boxes from him which originally started at around \u00a3150 but ended up at less than half that price. This was not before the owner had told us all about his shop, his sons, his wider family, his love of his work as a carpenter how he had met the king of Morocco, the various qualities of each wood he used and of course the cup of mint tea we were offered, a trademark of Moroccan hospitality. All this took around an hour and was really as much fun as the actual buying. There is an open top bus service which costs around \u00a310 each but takes you round all the main sites of Marrakech and you can get on and off at the various stops all day long. There is commentary in 6 languages including English although the sound system on our bus was not working properly because people kept changing seats to plug into the audio system at different points. There are numerous museums and sights worth seeing in Marrakech. Well worth visiting is the Dar Si Said Museum near the Palais Bahia. It has some fascinating exhibits and beautiful designs on ceilings and walls that are worth the visit just for those alone.The Medina does take some getting used to and it is very easy to get lost. Eventually you get familiar with certain routes and if you do get lost it doesn\u2019t take long to get back on track. You can always ask a local but see my comments above. One man we asked was a teacher and happy to guide us back on to the main street when we got lost without expecting any tip or take us to a shop. Overall, Marrakech is a fascinating experience and well worth the visit. Hopefully our experiences will help others to enjoy it as much as we did."

You will get pestered to spend money in the Soukes - despite this sometimes being a bit overbearing initially - the humour and friendliness of the shop/stall holders is great - but it's a game you must be prepared to pay when you visit. The Jemma el Fna square is fascinating and full of character whether you go during the day or after dark. However - beware - if you take pics of the 'attractions' you will be expected to pay. I have no problem with this - the majority of people there are going about their daily business and must feel like zoo animals. We took 13 year old twin girls - they attracted alot of attention from the young men, Essential too keep a close eye on young females and give strong \"leave well alone\" messages when necessary however the attention was only verbal and pretty much not too far outside of what is considered appropriate. Go, take care and enjoy this fabulous city!"

Where the area of the souks is the part most tourists will wander through - getting themselves utterly lost in the process - the medina itself offers a more intriguing mixture of day-to-day life. It's here that the locals shop, here that they buy their meat (from places I'd never touch), their bread and their vegetables. It's a hubbub of local culture and tourist eye candy, and where you'd be a little foolish to pick up some of the \"bargains\" on offer. One young man had a stack of headphones that purported to be Dr Dre Beats and was trying to tempt westerners with really low prices; none of those looking and listening to his patter stopped to wonder how he'd managed to get hold of stock that would have counted as several years worth of his basic income!Despite the filth that covers more of the ground than it should, the medina would have been a much more interesting spot but for two terrible thorns - traffic and conmen. The former wouldn't be such a big problem if it were just the donkey carters and porters, but the mopeds that drive far too quickly through the narrow alleys are a definite danger, let alone the few random idiots that opt to drive a taxi along routes that are clearly restricted. Relax for a moment and you could very easily be run down.As for the conmen, be alert. Late one evening we walked home on our usual route when a man stepped in front of us and told us the way ahead was closed. I asked why and he simply said that the mosque had closed it. He clearly picked something that most westerners would think twice about questioning before asking us where we needed to go and then offering to take us there . . . along a different route that was much darker, narrower and far less public. Luckily I had my wits about me and said \"no\". He objected but eventually we just walked away and went along our normal route, which was obviously open and offered no obstacles at all. Not something that solo or vulnerable travellers should have to deal with in the middle of a busy city, but it is one of those things you perhaps have to accept.A fascinating place, but not one that I will be rushing back to any time soon."

As a couple our first thought was no, we had made a mistake and didn't like it. At the end of our first day we loved it. The start of our second day we hated it again. And so the love - hate experience went on until we acclimatised to the relentless noise and trading of the Medina. For that is what you have to do, it's a culture shock at first. Centuries old methods and buildings mixed with more modern, Donkeys walk the same streets as mopeds, Touareg Saharan nomads will mix with fluent English speaking Morroccans who would do well on an EastEnd market. Everybody wants your money, take a picture someone holds their hand out, get lost, someone knows the way for a price, stand still for a second, someone is shouting for you too look at the goods, point at something and be asked to 'make a good price'...We loved it! We refused help, worked things out for ourselves, and explored safely! Of course, when every stall is similar, and every Dirham is ferociously fought after, people have no choice but to talk to you and try to get you interested in their wares - but we never felt threatened, never too hassled, and if No didn't work first time, a firmer No Thank You a second was always met graciously with a smile and 'maybe tomorrow?'We were lucky, we stayed in the No1 rated (at the time) hotel (Riad khierredene) and were given a mobile phone and the most experienced and gracious guide we have certainly met (Ismail). He advised us to always offer 20% of any asking price and pay no more than 40% as a maximum, advice that we stuck to rigidly and it worked! Ever time I shook hands and said thanks but no thanks at 40%, I was told I must be Scottish and the deal was done. it made me smile every time.Personally, I wouldn't take my kids, they are too young. Older teenagers (17+) would be mature enough to enjoy the experience - for that is what it is, however there maybe reviews here where younger children have enjoyed it. That being said, it's a great place, busy, tiring, yes... But it's not threatening, we felt safe, and it was a fantastic, fantastic experience. 1 off our bucket list. A must see place - Brilliant!"

While I felt the Medina of Marrakech was wilder than Istanbul's Grand Bazaar and Cairo's Khan El Khalili, it is still worth going. I thought the major drawback here is the ubiquitousness of scooters and bicycles. Maybe the other markets I mentioned do sometimes have people riding through, I actually don't remember experiencing that at all in those other cities. In Marrakech it is the norm and it lends a chaos to the place I did not enjoy. The riders are not at all courteous to walkers: it's up to you to look out for them and their near constant honks. If you can adjust, I suppose it's an amazing place.The touts weren't necessarily aggressive, and some were very friendly, but there was some real rudeness displayed. Sometimes after a full day in the souks, the traveler gets a little run down and cannot politely decline every offer... we actually were screamed at once for not responding to a tout, which I found a bit offensive as we were just walking by, minding our own business on our way back. That said, plenty of shop owners were kind and did not mind us taking photos (I learned quickly to ask permission first) or just watching their craftsmanship. I made a few purchases that were priced so low I didn't bother bargaining and that seemed fine with all parties involved. Stop in to the vegan Earth Cafe for a delicious meal or get some fresh fruit juice from one of the many stands.This is a place of extremes.. people lovely and awful, smells fabulous and gross, sights pleasing and distressing. All in all, an enriching experience of a very foreign culture."

It's nothing like anywhere I've ever been before and my initial impression was just 'madness.'The medina is very busy at almost every hour of the day. It is crowded, noisy and smelly (sometimes good, sometimes bad!), there are bikes, motorbikes, taxis and donkeys pulling carts everywhere and not on any particular side of the road, so DO beware of traffic. As far as we saw, they won't crash into you - they know what they're doing - so don't stop/play chicken with them, just keep going and be aware of who's moving where around you.Locals in the medina LOVE tourists. Tourists are where they make their money. If you need to look at a map, try and do so discreetly as you will be inundated with offers of guides if you show off that you are lost. DON'T go with a guide unless they have been arranged for you by your Riad. The street guides are pushy for money, and while most are harmless, are more likely to get you lost, taking you to small squares and shops where they can get commission rather than where you actually want to go. We made the mistake of using a guide, gave him 100 dirhams, and he harassed us for more quite unpleasantly - not a mistake we made again!Women should dress respectably as the culture in old-city Marrakech still requires many women to wear full burkha and headscarf, so short skirts/shorts and low cut tops will draw unwanted attention to you. Also expect stares if you are blonde - things that make you different attract attention!If you want to buy something, look around at a few places to get prices. When you have an idea of how much it is widely sold for, go for it. DO haggle. We found that most traders were not offended if we offered them half their initial price, and if you start to walk away, they will lower the price even more. NEVER offer more than you are willing to pay. And don't waste their time - don't start to haggle over something you're never going to buy.The medina is beautifully rich with local food and crafts, and is a wonderful place to just walk around and take in the sights. While it can be intimidating to get the attention of every trader you walk past to begin with, they are (from my experience) harmless and are jsut trying to make a sale. Once you get used to where you should be going and work out how to navigate the medina, it's much less intimidating. If you ignore the shouts of traders and other overly-interested locals, they will more often not give up straight away - tourists are good for them and the last thing they want is to get a bad reputation for scaring them away. After a couple of days, you will relax and feel more used to the medina. Then you can really enjoy it and take in the culture and sights."

The price they give will usually by doubled, tripled or even quadrupled compared to what a local will pay. Now how do you get down to paying the local price or as close as possible to it, this is where haggling comes into play! When you ask the price carefully look for flaws and damage to bring your price down, next take the given price and divide by two and work around that new number. Try to go lower far lower until they do not want to sell it to you. When the seller is so annoyed and angry that they don't want to sell it to you any longer then that is when you have found the local price. This wont always work because you are a foreigner and therefore have money according to local logic, so shop around and don't buy the first one you see as the possibility that the same exact thing is just around the corner at a different price."

You still need a guide to be able to see what is worth seeing, however there are so many tourists that you lose the authenticity. Roads are large, while there are good opportunities for shopping (particularly metal work). I found the Medina of Fes much more interesting and an experience to make. My experience is to buy carpets/rugs and definetely pottery in Fes and wood work in Essaouira. Marrakech I find it more for metal work and pottery. However, if you want a less touristy experience, don't spend time here."

The medina smells of horse manure and was full of flies, it is rather dirty for my liking. During the day was much better, there was less hustle and bustle and people seem a little bit more relaxed although we had someone beg me to take a picture of them then tried charging me \u20ac2 (23dh) I refused to pay them and they got a abusive throwing money at me. Some of the locals are really funny but as I said take them with a pinch of salt because it is all for money. Although it was cheaper at night (from our experience) the night was pretty scary for me. As a young lady I felt a little on edge with my camera and other personal belongings. It was also heartbreaking seeing 3 year olds begging for money and food.There are snake charmers, monkey holders, henna ladies and all they want is your money, you can try take sly pictures but beware! They will abuse you if you don't give them the money they want. Don't kiss the snakes or monkeys, it don't bring good luck it will bring you to a toilet with a bad guts ache! My honest advice would be to keep your wits about you and trust no one, all they want is your money. Make sure you haggle for anything you want, a bag I wanted started at over 600dh and we got them down to 200dh, we could have got it less but that was what I wanted to pay."

The snake charmers want 200dh (about \u00a318) to put a snake on your childs shoulder and let you take a photograph, the stalls all sell the same stuff, fake designer goods, candles, light shades etc, and start at stupid prices for which you have to haggle, when you compare stuff with prices at home, you will realise not such a bargin. The market goes into a labyrinth, which is very narrow, very hot, your still dodging motorbikes and pushbikes, watching out for pickpockets bumping into you, its very easy to get lost (follow the blue signs to get out), if you ask a shop keeper how to get out, they normally end up taking you to a cousins 'factory' spice shop. Once back into the main square the smell of horse urine is overpowering, your still being hassled for, taxi tours, horse and cart tours, tour guides, people selling, fake phones, snake charmers, men with monkeys, men with balloons and crappy plastic toys (which they put into your childrens hands), men in fancy dress, you name it, they are there.

The Souks are but a small part of the Medina and those are what most people describe as very narrow and full of small shops and markets.The Medina is the old walled city of Marrakesh and is the size of a small town which is surrounded outside the walls, by newer areas of shops and housing estates. Also in the Medina are countless small Mosques with extremely loud sound systems ( i really cannot describe just how loud!) which waken you up at 05:10 in the morning.I agree with other reviewers, that there is a huge contrast between the accommodation - we stayed in a beautiful calm, riad, - and the streets of the Medina which are the opposite.Even away from the souks, (some of the souks are quite clean because the shop-keepers brush the area in front of their stalls) this is a dusty, dirty, smelly, place. Everywhere there are piles of rubbish, puddles, derelict houses and so many flies. This may, in part. be because of the numerous horses, donkeys, monkeys and sheep etc. to be found in this city.I was expecting the beggars,pestering and rip-offs, particularly in the Jamma El Fna (main) square as I have been to many countries with a 'bargaining' culture. What I was astonished about was the dangers from bikes and motorbikes in the alleys and from cars on the wider streets and also in the alleys. I would actually feel immoral if I didn't point out the dangers involved in walking anywhere inside the Modena. I saw countless incidences of bad food hygiene - for some reason food sellers feel the need to constantly rearrange their unwrapped produce, such as meat, bread, dried fruit and sweets, with unwashed hands.Needles to say there are flies crawling all over.Despite being extremely careful and eating only well cooked, hot food, no ice, sealed bottled water and not from street vendors, I returned with a bad case of diarrhoea.I'm not judging Marrakesh as I don't know why it's in such a poor state - there will be many who find it charming or interesting but I was bitterly disappointed. I consider it a wasted few days and will not return."

            "review": "Like Going Back in Time!. The Medina of Marrakech is crazy. My girlfriend and I stayed in a Riad in the heart of it all so everyday we'd be walking into the 'craziness'. I've been to many places across Europe and visited North and South America but the Medina was completely different to what I was expecting. As soon as our cab (taking us from the airport) drove through the Medina city walls it was like going back in time. If it wasn't for the hundreds of scooters and odd car, the place would seem untouched for hundreds of years. The roads in the Medina are like nothing I've seen before. About the size of a pavement with people walking either-side and scooters and/or donkeys pulling carts going down the middle. It is so busy that cars can only get down certain parts (hence why everyone rides a scooter). There is a lot to see in the Medina but to be honest, I think that two days is all you will need. The Souks are great to experience but you do get hassled non-stop by shopkeepers (which is expected). However, I found it was the teenage boys walking in front or following you and asking \"where are you from?\", \"what football team do you support?\" and \"the square is this way. I'll show you\" (when you're not even going to the square) that I found a problem. This is where you need to be very confident and either ignore them or say \"no thank you\" without making eye contact (they may even mumble profanities when you politely say \"no\" to them too). One tip we found if browsing the Souks is that if you see a group of Westerners on a guided tour, slowly walk to the back of it. The shopkeepers and teenagers leave you alone if they think you're part of an organised tour. Apart from the hassle you will get, the Souks are amazing and full of colour and smells. You can also see some people making their products that will eventually go for sale using a variety of instruments, which I thought was great.We got lost in the Souks and each time ended up in the square, which is another main attraction. This is where you find the snake charmers, monkeys on chains, henna ladies, food/orange juice market stalls and plenty of cafes. Again, in here you will likely be pestered but this will be for you to take a photo of someone or their friend. Again, you need to be ruthless and either ignore them or confidently tell them \"no\" (should you not want a picture). Sitting on the terrace of any of the cafe's is a must as it allows you to take it all in and see the magic that is going on below you. It is from here you can also take photos of whatever you like without someone suddenly demanding money.Overall, Marrakech is a fantastic city and visiting the Medina is an experience I will never forget. However I can imagine it being quite intimidating for some when locals start grabbing you to get your attention. I understand that people are in poverty and need to try everything in the book to make a living but a majority of their approach I found quite rude. If it wasn't for the constant hassling to hand over money, I would give it 5 stars."

            "review": "A truly Moroccan experience. Visiting the Medina is like stepping back in time. It is wonderful to walk past the local stalls and craftsmen. The culture is so different. There are stalls selling just about everything from meat, fish, vegetables and of course herbs and spices.The people are generally friendly and helpful; however, watch out for the people who come up to you claiming that they work at your Riad or Hotel. They generally don't and they want to take you somewhere to buy goods so that they get a commission.This also happens at several of the attractions. You will get people offering to take you to a particular place of interest but they will most likely take you somewhere entirely different and try and sell you something.The other ruse to watch out for is people telling you that the attraction you are going to is closed and offering to take you somewhere else. Never listen to them as generally it is open. Always check with your own eyes.Although this might sound a little scary, as soon as they are rumbled they will leave you alone. Learning a little Arabic is always useful. Saying 'La shokran' means no thank you...or simply say 'La' a few times and they soon get the hint."

Remember that everyone is working to get your money so things like taking a photo of someone or them taking a photo of you will cost you a few dirhams so don't engage with them if you don't want to pay. We ate 'local' food most of the time and didn't have any real trouble but use your common sense. Haggle prices of carriage rides and taxi rides down but we didn't feel like we were ripped off in any way. We did hire a guide to take us into the souks, again, haggle for the price. They will want to take you to rug shops, spice markets etc where they get a small commission--if you don't want to go, just be firm and say no or insist on leaving right away if it's not how you want to spend your time. A guide will keep other guides and hassle away but you can also get along on your own if you don't engage with anyone trying to become your guide. Many of the cafes in the square have free wifi but you may have to ask for the password. There is a taxi rank close to the square and we were always able to get a ride for a reasonable price--ask at your hotel for an idea about what is reasonable."

The cobblestone paths are full of people, donkeys and carts going past and people on motorbikes.There is an amazing atmosphere here and something I highly recommend. Will never forget our time in Marrakesch.Stay in a traditional riad as it is an experience you will never have anywhere else.Shopping is lots of fun, lots of haggling.Would still advise keeping an eye on purses and wallets.My husband and I were travelling with two adult children and sons wife.

Once you step inside you are engulfed in a whirlwind of sights, smells and sounds. Its sinewy streets are bursting at the seams with locals and tourists browsing the 1001 wares on offer. Scooters come whizzing by without warning often followed by vendors with donkey driven carts. You have to move fast as they won't attempt to avoid you. Whilst a bit un nerving for the unsuspecting visitor, dodging them becomes a bit of an amusing sport with time . Wonderful smells of spices and fresh olives tempt your nostrils whilst visions of beautifully crafted silverware, earthen ware, jewelry, Djellabas, pyramids of colourful spices and dates get you stopping at every stall. There is so much to see that you could easily spend over a day. My advice would be to do it in 2 or 3 hour sessions as its quite overwhelming for first timers. Prices are expensive and aimed at tourists so bargain as much as possible. Most vendors speak English, French and Spanish and are very easy to engage with. They are very pushy so be firm if you are just browsing. For a lunch time snack you can get a very reasonably priced and tasty sandwich on one of the squares. Aim for the ones where locals go as they are cheaper and food is really good. There are a number of tea houses and eating places destined at tourists which are very expensive and not very authentic.I particularly recommend the Snack de la Place where food is really good, cheap and service is fast. Its an absolute must if you visit Marrakech. Not just for the shopping but just for the experience. I already know what stall I want to visit next time!"

It takes a couple of days to see familiar fixtures and get your bearings to what is around, the leather goods are great but the quality of products can vary. There are many 'designer' fakes in clothing and other goods available so be very careful, although tempting at the time these purchases can be found as illegal.The food stalls are good but there tends to be alot of flies about, safer and also cheap and tasty are the cafe/restaurants available. The medina converts to an eating market for dinner and is worth a visit to taste the cuisine of the city and surrounds. There are taxis for transport and horse and carriages available during the day, which are more expensive but worth the experience.I will certainly go back again, now having seen what is available and more first hand knowledge, I know what I want to see, do and visit more thoroughly."

Inhabited by Berber farmers from Neolithic times, the city was founded in 1062 by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, chieftain and cousin of Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin. In the 12th century, the Almoravids built many madrasas (Koranic schools) and mosques in Marrakesh that bear Andalusian influences. The red walls of the city, built by Ali ibn Yusuf in 1122-1123, and various buildings constructed in red sandstone during this period, have given the city the nickname of the \"Red City\" or \"Ochre City\". Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural, religious, and trading centre for the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa; Jemaa el-Fnaa is the busiest square in Africa. After a period of decline, the city was surpassed by Fes, but in the early 16th century, Marrakesh again became the capital of the kingdom. The city regained its preeminence under wealthy Saadian sultans Abu Abdallah al-Qaim and Ahmad al-Mansur, who embellished the city with sumptuous palaces such as the El Badi Palace (1578) and restored many ruined monuments. Beginning in the 17th century, the city became popular among Sufi pilgrims for Morocco's seven patron saints, who are entombed here. In 1912 the French Protectorate in Morocco was established and T'hami El Glaoui became Pasha of Marrakesh and held this position nearly throughout the duration of the protectorate until the role was dissolved upon independence of Morocco and the reestablishment of the monarchy in 1956. In 2009, Marrakesh mayor Fatima Zahra Mansouri became the second woman to be elected mayor in Morocco."

The souks (probably a bit like those in Jerusalem as well) were certainly very busy and full of people and shops. But I didn't really feel like buying anything.The food etc. was quite affordable. But I didn't feel I was completely comfortable and at ease. I had to watch out and the place was also not all clean and neat."

So when my relatives suggested we go on holiday we thought they might like it as well. I have to say it is not as I remembered. It's a bear pit, certainly at the front. It's largely the same stuff on the stalls and the quality isn't great most of the time. The merchants seemed quite aggressive if you haggled below their expectations. Just about any attempt to take a photograph got a shout from someone. A gay couple were physically attacked by someone who took exception and it took several stall holders to rescue them. The opening prices were so way off the mark that we simply walked away (\u00a3110 for a cotton shirt for which I would guess at about \u00a315 in the UK). There were beggars everywhere. We only met a few stall holders who were willing to talk and they were in the much quieter alleys at the rear. I found the whole experience not very pleasant and we left Marrakech the next day. Sadly I think it's in danger of destroying itself through greed and bad manners but as it's been around this long I don't suppose that will be anytime soon. If you are going to Marrakech then you can't avoid it and is an amazing place but don't expect a bargain and be prepared for the fact that the experience may not be the expected or pleasant one you imagined."

Don't get caught by the snake charmers who spot the tourists & pounce, then before you know it they are looking for 300 dirham (approx \u20ac30).

I ended up walking towards him, stopping and just looking him in the face, I wanted him to know I had seen him! I think that local assume if you are going in to Zara you are rich.

Our first visit was early evening and the square was vibrant and exciting just walking around was a totally different experience with so many things going on. We walked around some of the souks but kept near the easily accessible parts as advised by our resort - this was good advice because we'd heard of others being ripped off by unofficial guides. It is also easy to browse the outer circles and there is plenty to see. On another occasion we booked an official tour guide and had a 3 hour tour - this was fantastic as he explained the history of the mosque, showed us palaces the Saadian Tombs and much more. It was good to be guided around the souks he showed us all the different areas and we felt safer with him. My best tip is not to enter the shops, you will find it difficult to get out without buying and the prices are too high. We ate in one of the terrace top restaurants in the evening with a great view of all the activity below. Marrakech is an vibrant and exciting destination but you can see it all in three days - we felt that was enough."

This made it easy to find exactly what we needed. We wanted Argan products so a particular pharmacy was suggested by our Around Morocco guide. \"To 100,000 Spices\" on Rue de la Kasbah. We enjoyed the informational spiel given by a lovely young lady. We purchased several items that I am still happy with one of which was the anti aging cream. Let her put kohl on your eyes for immediate beauty. We bought leather ottomans, called poufs, and some pottery. We surveyed all manner of craftsMEN, seamsters, welders without shields, wood carvers with scarred hands, metal workers making the tiniest slits in lamps, on the spot shoe makers, wool dyers with dye stains up to their shoulders. I wanted to buy one of everything. Instead, I offered small tips for allowing me to watch and ask questions. All were fascinating."

I have travelled a lot and usually spend most of my travels in 3rd world countries so I understand how poverty affects places and people and am very used to it, but most of the popular 3rd world places have some great redeeming features. And I had heard so much about Marrakech, we were so excited about finally getting there. BUT, I hated it.. I just cannot understand what attraction there is in this place? I feel like we must have missed something?? No redeeming features in this dump. Many other cities in all over the world have far more interesting/attractive town centres. Marrakech medina was very dirty (the entrance to the Medina on the Jardin de Marjorelle end is literally a rubbish dump), way too expensive, generally rude people ( some lovely exceptions of course), and impossible to enjoy because you couldn't really look at anything much less take a photo without having to pay someone. Also saw many dead/near dead kittens/cats and poorly treated donkeys, horses, dogs, monkeys etc. I know all 3rd world countries see Westerners as rich, but never felt so taken for a ride as we did here - most of them barely gave you a smile as they tried extracting cash from you. We weren't there to shop (being on a 6 week backpacking trip) so cannot see what else you can do in Marrakech. Even if you were shopping, it really was cheaper to purchase half the stuff back home and Australia isnt cheap! And once you had been in the souk for 5 mins the stores just repeated the same touristy junk, so not exactly what id call interesting. Any cafes or restaurants that had a decent atmosphere were easily Western prices. And the square? yes it really comes alive at night, but its not like you can enjoy any of it, to even stand in one spot and look at a performance for more than a few seconds they want $$. by day its a dusty, half constructed hole with hassles of another type. The only part the we liked about Marrakech was our Riad (Riad Aliya). We actually tried to change our flights to get out of Marrakech earlier than planned to not waste anymore of our holiday time there, but they were all booked up, so have headed out to Essaouira, which is a much more pleasant alternative."

Navigate the maze of the Medina dodging motorcycles and mopeds along the way. Try to absorb the culture and be as one of the locals and embrace the hustle and bustle. The people of Marrakech are very accommodating and seem to have a real sense of community and solidarity. In the Souks you will come across some interesting characters, shop owners putting in long shifts trying to sell there wares. Here you can find a vast array of products, from cosmetics to hand carved wooden boxes. Remember to haggle! Nothing here has a fixed price, you will always be shown respect by the shop owners if you can barter well, often you come away with a price you are more than happy with as long as you can move slightly from your first lowest price. Often upon giving them a low price they will say things such as \"you are breaking my heart\" but if you stick to your guns there are bargains to be had, even when you walk away they will often have a quick con flab with one of there friends and chase you down offering you your price. The people, the colour, the smells, the atmosphere make this place really magical."

Go: it's a scene, and buy for sure -- support the artisans, but pay about 25-35% the asking price. The spices, soap and locally made stuff is great. Yes, be careful of your wallets. I had the most fun when I went with a couple of friends; numbers can distract and we could laugh a lot. When I wander around alone there's too much hassle, too much attention. At night it's a wonderful scene and fun to eat -- the orange juice venders are the best, especially during Ramadan. The olives are fabulous, so many different kinds and tastes. If you like grilled meat, this is the place. Wonderful drumming, and gnaoua performers, amusing stuff going on at night."

You have to go through an archway to get inside and you really will feel like you have stepped back in time. Lots of people riding donkeys and bicycles, street vendors pushing carts piled high with fruit or bread, horsedrawn carriages, street performers. I love markets and this one is one of the best. The little pathways can be very confusing so I recommend you use a guide to help you get around, otherwise you will spend an lot of time getting lost and going in circles.What can you see here? Leather goods, jewelry, pottery, yarn, rugs, teapots and tea glasses, clothing, tourist trinkets, shoes, lanterns, tangines, etc. This is not a wet market with food but just about everything else is here for you to buy.Yes, it is touristy but sometimes it's just fine to be a tourist. You are one, aren't you?Just be aware that if you see something that catches your eye, you will be in for a sometimes long interaction with the shopkeeper. There are no prices on anything and you are expected to haggle for everything. Our guide told us to expect to pay less than half of what they tell you the price is. Sometimes this is fun and part of the whole souk experience but after a while it can be just a pain in the neck. Some of these guys are just overbearing and annoying. If they annoy you too much, move on. You will find another shop selling the exact same thing on down the road and maybe a nicer shopkeeper.Be sure to leave plenty of time - at least two days - to fully explore the medina and the souks."

Our guide gave us prices we should pay and found that nearly everything we inquired about was 3-4x more expensive. Beautiful and elaborate caftans, for instance, were being sold for $80-100 here. While in Ville Nouvelle (new town, just 5-10 minutes outside the Medina), these could be purchased for about $20-25.We didn't experience aggressive sales tactics and even though I was wearing a sundress, I didn't feel I was getting unwelcome attention. In general, I'd say 75% of Western female tourists wore shorts and tank tops (if not less) and it didn't really turn heads. "

The square was heaving with people leaving the mosque and breaking their fast at the food stalls. It was loud, crowded and quite good fun. The atmosphere was very good. However, after a while, it became quite repetitive with shopkeepers almost grabbing us to sell us their wares and not liking it when we said no. At one point, my boyfriend had to shout at one man so he got the message. The orange stalls are a good price and the juice is lovely. During the day, you really do seehow dirty the place is. I wore flip flops and stood in puddles of what I imagine was horse and cat pee. I saw several, emaciated, dead kittens thrown to the side of the road and didn't appreciate seeing monkeys grabbed and thrown about by leads from their collars. At no point would I pay to have photos with the monkeys or the snakes - which were regularly smacked with the lids of the baskets they were in. Also, in 42c, I didn't agree with letting horses drag people around the square. Yes, there's an atmosphere and it is vibrant at night, but inside the medina, the Western and African cultures are poles apart and it's like going back several decades. Don't stop to consult a map - you will be harassed and eventually cajoled for a tip by someone wanting to point you in an direction that they fancy. Don't stop at a stall unless you are willing to haggle 3 quarters of the price off or willing to argue with the stall keeper. Do NOT let women give you henna tattoos in the square! I refused and the woman grabbed my hand, started painting on it & then demanded 200 Dirham. I shouted her down and have her 20 dirham - and for that she was lucky! Also, they use black 'henna' which is cheap and contains a toxin called PPD which can scar - so be warned - it's not the proper stuff !! The food is so so, not brilliant but some of the ice cream is lovely. Don't forget it is a Muslim country so if you want a beer (some places sell alcohol on roads just off the square) you pay a lot for it and can't drink it on the street. Also, a couple of times I wore strapless dresses and no onesaid anything to me. I gave up covering myself when I saw quite a few women hadn't bothered - plus the men look at you even if you are covered. Overall, I liked some stalls and some of atmosphere but the stall keepers are constantly harassing you as are the taxi and carriage drivers! It's so bad I almost lost y temper at times. The place is also filthy and smells of pee (especially closer to mosque where the horses stand). It's a bit of a toilet and I can't wait to go home!"

We tried to explain we didn\u2019t but they were very pushy so we let one of them \u201chelp\u201d us. After about 1-2 minutes he \u201cgot us to the right way\u201d. We realized that he just took us off the right way, through this very cramped alleys and then back to the way we were at. For this he charged us 20 dirhams, about 2 euros. Actually, first we gave him 10 but he got very angry and said \u201cthis is nothing in Morocco\u201d\u2026we were a bit scared, so we gave him another 20. In Jemaa El Fnaa: you can find everything there, monkeys, birds, snakes, food and shopping. It\u2019s extremely touristy, but a must see! The only thing that bothered me was the constant harassment \u2013 to buy this, see that\u2026 one guy in particular, the snake guy, was very annoying. We took from far a picture from the snakes he then approached us and put on a snake over my husband\u2019s shoulders even though we tried to tell it wasn\u2019t really necessary\u2026he then wanted to charge us 20 euros for that! Of course we didn\u2019t pay that and he got very angry and a bit agressive\u2026How much to tip: at hotels, we read that about 10 dirhams per luggage is fine and 10% service in restaurants. Restaurants: touristy places charge about 120 dirhams per person, but you can find other restaurants just as good for much less, about 80.Dress code for women: in Marrakesh and Fes, they are more used to tourists. I tried to wear at least knee length skirts, but I did see some tourist with short skirts and shorts, up to you! The other cities are a bit more conservative, so with knee length or long skirts I felt comfortable. I also always brought with me a scarf, so when it was hot and my shoulders were uncovered, if I felt the need I just put on the scarf.Taxis: there are 2 kinds, the small one and the large. The small only fits 3 people, the big fits 4. Some small ones didn\u2019t have a meter, so we had to negotiate the price."

So avoid that. Also avoid walking into the small shops as it's often very difficult to get out. That said, it was me and my mum (two women) so it might be less intrusive if a male was there.The prices are a rip off! Our hotel gift shop was cheaper. You can also pretty much get everything cheaper in the UK and in camden! I paid \u00a330 for a small moroccan lamp last time (being naive) because we couldn't get away. It's very easy to get lost. Therefore this time we went on an organised tour through Thomson and it was (still stressful but) much better.

As a blue-eyed, blonde woman there were very few occasions where I felt conspicuous, but I kept my head covered (both as a gesture of respect and to keep my hair from burning in the sun) and a \"laissez-moi tranquille\" when I was hassled, which wasn't often."

Well, my husband and I set off for the Medina early in the morning walking, we were told the wrong direction and ended up going through a side entrance and not through the large square, we walked through endless alleyways and we're 'misplaced,' was the word my husband used, I used the word 'Lost,' we were eventually guided back into the square from a guide who then wanted payment, which was far too high and my husband had to argue with him a price and then told him to 'get lost,' in so many words. You have to be really assertive and strong when visiting there with the haggling and everything. It was a great experience, even though I must admit was a little frightened when we got lost....... but there was nothing to fear...... had a great experience and went there two more times to shop during our holiday, however this time did not get lost, really enjoyed Marrakech."

They will try and lead you to commission based shops/get you lost - not nice. - stay to the right hand side. - don't be afraid to say no and be forceful!

When leaving your hotel/riad, if someone says something like \"Are you staying at the riad?\" And something like \"You may not recognize me because I changed clothes\" it is a scam. Do not believe him. He will walk you to stores where he gets a commission.2. People will offer you many things, from henna painting to directions, and then ask for money. I'm all for helping the locals if they've done something to help that I wanted, but they are fierce about it. Don't feel bad saying no. In Arabic, \"La, shokran\" means, \"No, thank you.\" Memorize it and say it strongly when you need to.3. While I felt sold-to and price-haggled beyond tolerable levels, once I strongly said \"La, shokran\" things got easier.-- Enjoy the medina!"

There are also some specific souks which are selling artisan work that's quite different from the cookie-cutter stuff - like Monsieur Michelin.

It can be intimidating in some places and the persistent chatter of stall owners attempting to sell you goods can be overwhelming.To get a bargain at least half the starting price, another tactic is simply to walk away and the price will quickly come down. Someone told us don't feel bad - they wouldn't sell it to you for a loss so they must be making some profit.Be wary of 'young' people appearing to be helpful and offering directions or 'follow me' - it is bad to generalise this way but in our experience they will just end up asking for money. You can normally find you're own way back to the main square or otherwise we were told ask older stall/shop owners."

We got caught but having loudly refused we were immediately left alone; shame they lived up to the bad rep.HAVE THE FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE! Every stall sells it at the same price 40p/4 MAD, pick one and make it your regular and you will get a lovely welcome and possibly a free drink. You can buy water in the small shops to the right of the square for \u00a31 a litre.If you get there around 5pm you will witness the transformation from empty space to packed, covered street food market, traders with their wares spread out on a mat, henna or fortune tellers sitting on low stools and the ubiquitous snake charmers appear. As dusk falls the hub bub of buskers/social music gatherings, applause for the acrobats & the general hum of diners talking fills the air.Do not be afraid to eat at the street food stalls; personally I would rather see what is being done to my food than go to a caf\u00e9/restaurant where the kitchen could be doing goodness knows what. Also, everything is either blistering hot in a tagine \u00a34.50/45 MAD that continues to bubble when brought to the table, or barbecued on a raging grill; we nor anyone we spoke to had any upset tummies and it is so worth the experience.

Most of the drivers do not speak any English so you will only get to converse if you know any French/Arabic.If you are near the SOUK KAFE the 100 MAD/\u00a310 set menu is worth it on a lovely rooftop terrace. It is within sight of the square but you can easily get lost in the alleyways \u2013 we got a taxi there & back for \u00a310 which was over the odds but worth the safety.Sadly, there is a McDonalds (new town, milk shake \u00a31.50/15 MAD) and a KFC; reluctantly, although we did not eat there, the latter which is by the entrance to the Medina, had a great 3 pces chicken meal deal \u00a33.50/35 MAD compared to the \u00bc fried chicken & chips \u00a34.50/45 MAD we ate in the street market!This is a dry country; they do not drink alcohol, so you will only get coffee, tea & soft drinks in any public areas.

We were happy to buy something however we were then approached by the owner of the tannery asking for money and thereafter the young man approached us again wanting his money for taking us there. Don't let a few spoil a great experience but be aware and learn a few Arabic words to help you through."

The medina has a reputation of being a chaotic, maze-like warren, but I have to say that with a good map, a bit of attention, and real patience, it is not so difficult to navigate. ...both in terms of the geography and the locals. There are lots of people who want to sell you things (of course -this is why the souk exists), and there are lots of kids who want you to give them a few $ for showing you around... but if you just talk with them and slow down a little to engage then you'll find that they are equally interested in just \"meeting\" you. I guess it helps as well if you speak a little French... and make a little effort.The medina is a big impressive inner-city, take some time to get to know it, and then you will really be able to enjoy it!"

We'd never have found them on our own.We didn't find the souks a hassle at all, despite many reviews saying we would! Yes, if you stop and look they'll try to sell you something but a firm, polite \"La shukran\" soon sorts it out.Bargains to be had though. My husband got a lovely leather satchel bag for 500 dirhams - so about \u00a343! Be prepared to start low - don't go more than half of the price they say and be prepared to put it down and walk away. A) they won't let you go far before agreeing to your price and if they don't then b) they'll be another shop selling exactly the same around the corner!Not sure I'd want to go there after dark as imagine finding your way back out could be tricky but overall, felt very safe and it was great fun. Just keep your bag close to you, be friendly and polite and you'll have a great time."

It was full of people so we decided to walk around the edge of the throng. There were crowds of people, locals and visitors, gathered around groups of traditional musicians and dancers performing in the square. There were lots of souvenir stalls in the square but we didn't bother. Apparently visitors have to haggle on every price. We had never seen so many fresh orange juice sellers in one place. The Souk is in the Medina and there visitors will find the narrow streets with thousands of shops selling everything from beautiful pottery, leather and carpets to a variety of knock-off sports goods and trinkets. The spice sellers, who appear to be imprisoned inside their colourful stalls, should not be missed. There are lots of places to eat in the Medina and visitors should shop around for the best value."

Stay in the Medina in a Riad so that you can dip in and out of the excitement. You might get bothered once or twice but just walk away and start again. Its not the end of the world. We got an official guide on the first day through the Riad and saw all the sites and after that we were able to navigate without getting lost. It is well worth the 600 drm we spent for the day and no one bothers you. It was worth it for not having rows about getting lost alone.My tip is not to visit the tanneries. It is a collection of vats of pigeon poo with hide soaking in it at temperatures of 30 degrees plus. The smell is evil and the people there miserable. Why put yourself through it. There is a scam going on whereby you are picked up on the way there by someone saying they are on their way to work and then you are handed over to someone else in the tanneries itself who shows you around. As soon as you are handed a bunch of mint, you are about to be had. If you have not already turned around, do so now. They will try and get a lot of money out of you for taking you round. It is a hellish and miserable place. not worth seeing in the first place so why put yourself through it, If you do get caught stand your ground and say your money is in your hotel and they will give up and take 200 drm which is what it is worth. But my advice is not to bother"

During the evening it's just as lively with Moroccan lamps lit up - dancers and snail soup for sale. We took in the night scene by sitting on a roof terrace having mint tea."

Your hotel can book this for you. Make sure to get the right price before you set out. In the hot weather go early in the morning as it can get quite uncomfortable as you will do lots of walking. make sure you are covered up if you don't want extra attention form the locals. Wear a bag over your shoulder and don't draw attention to yourself with flashy clothes or jewellery.Make sure that you tell the guide what it is your looking for as they will take you to their friends shops where they get commission.You could be shocked at some of the things that you see but its their culture so take the magic from it. You will amazing things but haggle with them. If they wont take your offer walk away 9 times out of 10 they will come after you. I wouldn't recommend going into the medina at night especially if you are girls on your own, it is very very busy and a haven for pickpockets.The only bar worth going to in in the jewish quarter called Cosy Bar again make sure you have booked a taxi to collect you as when dark coming out can be a little scary.Shopping at I would recommend the new city where you will find it lit and safe.Be careful of the drivers as they just don't stop for anything.Get your guide to show where all the hidden palaces are in the souks behind amazing large doors- this is where the rich live."

Of source have your camera ready but ask the license of the people to photo them. It's some kind of religious thing that they don't want to photo their faces. Good surprise that you can feel safe, ok take care of your thinks but the general sense is that nobody will try to rub you. People has humor and positive attitude. Of course don't buy to the initial price they will tell you, you must low the prices. Interest art in a lot of small galleries. Don't let something that you want to buy for later because is almost certain that you won't find the same souk again. After the first walk you will know how to handle all the kids that will try to show the way. Or trust them and enjoy the way that will lead you in specific stores before show you the way, otherwise just avoid them. Have fun ;-)"

Paid them off but they continued to follow us a few streets later and ask for more. The only way to shake them off was to shout loud \"POLICE\" repeatedly. So do that, if you get a similar problem. Never let anyone lead you there because most likely you will pay them (which is fine if it is a little and only make sure it is just a little money). Always be sure where you are going or ask another tourist for help. Be with a woman or family and you might not be bothered to such an extent. You will have to pay everyone off - even if you take a photo of a street scene someone may demand payment for being in it. In fact, avoid the whole place - you won't miss much. Perhaps just worth visiting for a morning or afternoon to see a few of the places like the Madressa and a couple of souq streets. Preferably go with a pre-organized reliable, repuable and professional guide.It's a pity scoundrels ruin for those nice people who need to make their living there.

Loved the buzz, the myriad of colourful silks, leathers, textiles and spices, the donkey laden carts and the variety of goods on offer.Disliked not being able to examine an item without the incessant attention of the stallholders, we would have bought more if we were given a few minutes peace. Haggling, initially rather fun, became tedious and we often felt unsure as to whether we were paying way over the top for items.Consequently, we bought very little.We were also constantly annoyed by the men who wanted to show us the way, expecting money in return. We are well experienced travellers and walkers that learn routes very quickly.When exploring the Kasbah, friendly children and teenagers would shout dead end, to direct us. We never felt unsafe, even walking home late at night. Just annoyed by those trying to extract money from us.Enjoy this sensual feast, it's what makes Marrakech so special. "

The locals will know with uncanny precision exactly which language you speak and where you are from, walk confidently with your map and avoid requests to help you find your way and people telling you that you are lost. After all its a walled city so there's only so far you can get lost! Expect to feel suffocated with diesel fumes, take care on the roads, they are chaos. whole families on a tiny motor bike with the driver holding the baby !! i found it difficult to cross at times and needed to hang on to my partner. Haggling is expected , and normal, (and yes i haggle in the UK all the time, often with good results!) Alcohol is supposedly not allowed in the walled Medina, however a few restaurants and Riads do sell it, at a high price. Women should dress carefully, sometimes just putting a scarf over the shoulders is enough, and longer shorts, no minis/scimpy clothes. Public toilets are interesting, you will need a coin to give the attendant. Restaurants have normal western style loos. we did see tourists in wheelchairs, so assume everything is possible in this crazy place"

Once you get through the intimidating Djemma el Fna (and I am a born and bred New Yorker and I was intimidated!) the Medina in Marrakech is spectacular. My husband I had some things in mind we wanted but we bought even more!! The requirement here is bargaining. While am I not comfortable or good at haggling, I engaged in this \"sport\" throughout the Medina. The sights and sounds as you wind your way through the streets (much wider and easier to traverse than Fes) are spectacular. If you pass a vendor selling local macaroons from a tray while walking, by all means buy one (or two) - they are a delightful afternoon treat! I needed to leave the Medina, only because we had bought too much to carry. Ottomans, wall sconces, a tagine (which I thought we would never get home in one piece) and so much more. My husband and I will treasure this trip forever (even after he finished gluing the tagine togather - oh well!)Salaam!"

Most of what's inside the city is old and unpolished, but it is exactly this that brings out the beauty in it. Un-commercialized, and uncorrupted by the dominant influences of the highly civilized western world, this medina has been able to stay true to itself. the stores along the small winding alleyways are but stalls but with a plethora of authentic moroccan crafts and items that one will not find in walmart or any other department store. The range of handicraft from hammered silver tea pots to the beautiful stencilled and colourful lanterns, hand made jewellery, and handmade bars of solid fragrances (that come in moroccan rose and jasmine ) and arabic kohl, I found it very refreshing and a closer feel to authentic North African culture and lifestyle. The medina, with its winding small alleys is also no stranger to beautiful architecture, littered within it are some of the most beautiful arcs and mosaic works i have ever seen and is really worth a visit. If you're looking for authentic adventures like me and aren't afraid of stepping out a bit from your comfort zone then this is the perfect place for you! with a little bit of courage in haggling, one can get amazing bargains for original artisanal masterpieces offered throughout this culturally rich city. I highly recommend this adventure for friends or couples, but not so much for families with very small kids as it might be hard not to lose them with so many winding alleys and paths"

Everyone will. You can't walk 5 feet without someone trying to (literally) pull you into their shop. It's kind of funny at first, but starts get get really annoying and actually starts to make you cautious after a short while. My poor, sappy self who can't barter if my life depended on it, got severely taken advantage of (essentially robbed). A man from outside the souks pulled me deep into the maze for a good 10 minutes, then essentially demanded that I buy shoes from him. Him, along with 4 other men, surrounded me in the shop until I forked over 35 pounds ($55-60) for a pair of shoes I didn't even like. Like, actually took it out of my wallet, counted it, then pushed me away. Then, they attempted to take me to the friend's shop, but I was so angry that I yanked my hand away and figured out how to get out of the maze of souks. Very irritating. Anyway, don't let this scare you. This place is awesome, being full of neat trinkets, music, food, and dancing (especially at night), but get some willpower to say no and be firm with your answers. Even better if you go with someone else to back you up. They will step all over you otherwise."

Outside of the souks the Medina is basically a slum and very, very dangerous. I would never stay in the Medina again even though the Riad I stayed at was exceptionally good.Imagine tight alleyways with no logical structure extending for miles. Imagine those alleyways packed with people. Imagine being accosted every single step you take by beggars, shop keepers, restaurant staff, and most intimidating of all male youths between 16 and 25 who harass you for money for showing you the way to where you knew you were going anyway. Imagine those alleyways then populated with hundreds of mopeds, pedal bike, donkeys and carts, all sorts of three wheeler contraptions, hand carts and indeed big powerful motor bikes. You come across blockages so often it makes any movement through the Medina tedious and dangerous, imagine the fumes from mopeds and motor bikes that are years old and never serviced, the fumes at times made me feel like I was going to die.We lost count of the number of accidents we saw, including one which resulted in a mass brawl. Yep your in an alleyway with 30 people kicking off all around you, no place to move. Had to stand in front of my wife arm in arm with a sane Moroccan man who was stood in front of his wife just to protect them from the fray.There were many other accidents as these vehicles drive at mad speeds around corners, swerving around you, often knocking you in the back. We saw one child hit with real force in the leg by a moped, which drew blood and may well have caused breakage for all we know.We cut our holiday short by two days, we could not stand it any more. You may be able to cope for a couple of days, but my advice is stay in the new town and travel into the Souks and square when you want. Forget any nostalgic view you may have of the Medina, it isn't real. Again don't confuse the Souks with the rest of the Medina. The Souks are really good fun but can be energy sapping after a couple of days."

The Souks are a bustling rabbit warren full of noise and colour. If you go to the main square in the evening (a MUST), you will be surrounded by noise, entertainers and food stalls. Be aware, if you take a photo of a snake charmer etc, expect to be harassed for some payment, but, to be fair, there isn't a lot they can do if you don't pay. Go see the Bahia Palace, it is amazing. Only to be surpassed, in my opinion, by the Jardin Majorelle. Yves St Laurants garden and final resting place. It alone was worth the trip.DEPARTING. There are some thing they don't tell you about the airport. READ your online check-in voucher. It will probably tell you to have it stamped at the airline check-in desk. If not you will stand in line for security for nothing, they will send you back. They have separate lines for Men and Women through security, it's a big hassle, as you don't find out until you are almost there then have to go join another line.

Constantly being asked what you want, where you going, come into my shop etc etc. The locals just view you as a walking cash machine and have no respect for anyone foreign.

In fact I would strongly recommend staying in the Medina itself as that is really where everything happens.The Medina is mostly a maze of small passages where cars cannot go and the only way to get around is to walk. At first it seems very alien to a westerner and perhaps just a bit scary - but there really is no need to worry as it is generally safe and most people are very friendly. It is very easy to get lost in the passageways and if you look lost you will probably get approached by someone offering to help you - watch out though because they will probably want to be paid for any help;The central attraction of the Medina is the huge and crazy Jemaa el Fna square where you will find snake charmers, monkeys, and all sorts of stalls and performers. You have to be careful here - any eye contact will get you embroiled with someone who wants money off you in one way or another. This to me was one of the most annoying things about the Medina as a whole - the people pestering you are like annoying wasps but you rarely get a beautiful summers day without the wasps and that is what the Medina is like - if you think this will spoil your enjoyment then don't go as it is part of what Marrakech is.The other great (possibly much greater) attraction is the souks - the miles of colourful covered passageways with a myriad of stalls selling all sorts of crafts and goods. This place is amazing - I cannot begin to describe the colour. smells, noise etc - it is not to be missed. You will be pestered to buy stuff but polite refusal will usually shrug them off. If you do want to buy anything then nothing is priced - you have to haggle - and remember whatever they ask for you need to at least half it before even considering a purchase. Also shop around as the price can vary vastly from stall to stall. And if you want the best price just start to walk away and they will chase you and offer a more reasonable price. This sort of haggling does not come easy to most westerners but it is quite fun really. Always remain polite - I found nearly all of the sellers to be very friendly - but sometimes painfully persistent.Also in the Medina I recommend you see the landmark Koutoubia mosque, the Bahia Palace, the El Badi Palace and the Saadian Tombs.Things to watch out for are the youngsters who bizarrely keep telling you a road is closed up ahead. Just ignore them - I am not sure what scam this would lead to - probably charging you to be led another way. We felt quite safe - have read reviews mentioning pickpockets and petty thefts and I am sure this happens so take care, I am fairly confident you do not need to be afraid of any sort of violent crime though and we felt quite safe walking around the passageways at night. The biggest danger you will face will probably be from the mopeds that zoom around weaving between the people - best advice is don't try to dodge them - it just confuses things - they will dodge you. Where there are roads in the Medina that have traffic they are hell to cross and there are no crossing so you just have to go for it and hope they wont run you over.The Medina is a historic gem that feels like it has not changed much since the middle ages. It is full of colour, noise, smell and excitement. It is very exhausting and you will feel the relief of getting back to your quiet riad or hotel after a day out. It is a great place to visit , a bit of a culture shock and all the better for it. It may not be to everybody's liking but I loved it."

People (children and adults) are costantly asking for money, they start walking near you and even though you don't say a word to them they ask for money once you get to your destination to which they supposely \"brought\" you. Marrakech is indeed a charming city but I would put Fes as the \"must see\" Medina."

We stayed in the medina, thankfully close to Jemaa El Fna so we could always find our way back to the riad. Morocco is a beautiful country, but the medina of Marrakech is unbelievably challenging. The \"streets\" aren't marked, what's on one map is not on another, and with the sensory overload you'll experience this area can be too much. Advice for this area? Go in knowing that everyone will be asking for money, it will be noisy, loud, and dirty, and you'll probably wander the same streets again and again only to pass what you've been looking for. But, know that Moroccans are a very generous people and I never felt unsafe. It's bright, colorful, and something you should at least spend a day enjoying."

I had read all the reviews, good and bad and in the back of my mind I was worried I was going to hate the Medina but I have come back loving it! The Medina has many sights to see including:The Jemaa el-Fnaa (the main square): By day full of snake charmers, men with Monkeys and ladies wanting to draw on you with Henna....all of which we steered clear of. The Henna ladies are a bit of a nightmare and grab you and try and draw on you but a firm 'La Shuckran', no thank you in Arabic seems to do the trick rather than taking in English or French to them. You have to be firm though. The atmosphere is great though and we went to the Cafe France to sit on the terrace and watch the world go by on three occasions. There are stalls selling orange juice and dried fruit and souvenir stalls all around with streets leading to the many Souks. By night the food stalls arrive along with the musicians and entertainers. It's mad but again has a great atmosphere. You will have men coming up and putting their arms around you to have pictures taken....one such group asking us for 100 euros! Keep small notes in a pocket so that you can give them say 20 dirhams and then show them you have no more although they will be pushy. A money belt is a good idea, one guy we met had had his wallet stolen in the square. We were told to eat at the inner stalls but getting there is tough with everyone trying to get you to eat at theirs. In the end we found a simple looking stall on one of the outside corners where it looked like only locals were eating...they didn't try and drag us in and they didn't have a big display showing what they were selling so we decided this was the place for us and had a lovely selection of kebabs, sausages and of course the gorgeous bread. The Square is touristy, my husband described it as the Blackpool of Marrakech, but it's fun and so long as you keeps your wits about you, you'll have a great time!The Souks: Wander and get lost, it's the only way to do it. There is so much to see and buy. We wanted to get a djellaba (the hooded gown the men wear) and went to the Maison du Kaftan which was horrendously expensive. At first we were quoted 1800 dirhams which is over a \u00a3100 for a plain one. We got him down to 600dh which was still far too expensive. A little wander further on and we saw a little covered market off the souks selling pretty much the same thing....opening price 200 dh which we eventually got for 160dh, about \u00a312 and we really pleased with our bargain. Shop around for things, it's amazing how much of a difference in price there is from place to place and if you're not happy with the price, walk away. They'll probably chase you down or if not, try the next stall! We did a cooking class and went shopping at the locals food market. The fruit and veg was really good quality and our chicken was killed freshly for us, not for the faint hearted but you certainly knew what you were about to cook with and eat was fresh. The Tanneries: we weren't planning on a trip here but ended up doing a tour. Ask how much your guide wants before you go in. They tried to rip us off here by asking for 300 dh (about \u00a325) after the tour which we refused to pay. You will be taken to a shop and given mint tea and shown all the rugs, bags, shoes and carpets they make and you will get the hard sell. I bought a bag but had been intending to and thought here was as good a place as any, especially after seeing what the men go through to make the leather. If you don't want to buy anything it may be worth trying to get out of going into the shop in the first place! The tanneries stink...pigeon excrement is used to soften the leather...the conditions are poor, men are up their necks in it and apparently the colourants used are no longer natural but chemical and carcinogenic which is a terrible shame but it is a real eye opener and we were really glad we went. We visited the Berber tannery so I'm not sure how this compared to the Arabic tannery.Museum of Marrakech and Ben Youssef Madrassa: the museum is quite small but a great example of the architecture. Everything is written in French so if you are English speaking it may be worth employing a guide. The Ben Youssef Madrassa was an Islamic college and shows how the students lived in small living quarters, apparently the better family you were from, the better room you got but they are all so small. Amazing building, definitely worth a look and quite cheap to get in.There is far more than just this in the Medina, you will have to choose what you want to do as there is so much to see. Some great little restaurants in the back streets and a few up market bars springing up. I can't wait to go back and see more!"

A medina is a square where business is done, there are spice stalls, eating places which serve cheap food and rather nice and loads of shops selling cheap replica rubbish in the main. The stall holders are ok for a while with their cockney accents and jokes but it all gets a little tedious after a while. I felt a little uneasy in places especially the back street areas, there were small gangs of youths simply watching, so have your wits about you, zip bags up keep hold or put wallets in front pockets and put your hands in too.If you're going to buy make sure you get what you pay for, one of our party purchased a bag and when they unwrapped it they got a damaged one. They will try and Sam you if you are naive.At night things are a little frantic and precarious. Mopeds everywhere some with lights often not. The food stalls come into their own tough in a big group you were aggressively targeted which could concern some people. Be firm and say no, don't take offence to banter, the food can be around \u00a33 and is nice, the washing up and drying of plates Nd cutlery should not be watched. There s no alcohol here as it is in view of the mosque. Overall this is Africa and people are desperate for your money. Be careful what you buy as most is junk but go for the experience. One man helped us and took us via his shop, as they do in Egypt, Tunisia etc. we got some great crystals for clearing sinuses for a few pounds. He was a nice chap. Danger wise no different to a lot of cities in the UK keep your wits about you and try it once, that was enough for me."

The food markets can be really pushy but you need to make your own choices and not be swayed. We ate at a number of the stalls and they range from the usual tagine, couscous and skewers to brains, calamari and goat. Try one of the smaller stalls where the locals are all sat with mint tea (very sweet) and rolls. The rolls are filled with mashed potato, egg, cheese. salt and chilli and are awesome.(plus they are only 50p and are good for the budget !) and very filling.Whilst wandering around the marlet and square there is also lots of entertainment and bartering to be done - but watch out for mopeds dashing everywhere or you will get mown down ! Also if you do go off wandering, beware of guides trying to 'help' as they will often take you to their own shop or require payment - but dont be over wary as some are very friendly.The main square at night is truly amazing and a definite visit whilst in Marrakech."

From the moment you enter the Medina (old town) of Marrakech your in a world dominated by the business of getting your business and money. Open a map and instantly more than one child or adult will latch themselves to your side asking or guessing your destination. Even if you are within feet of a place you know well, these \"helpers\" will, when you try and enter your destination, demand money for the help they claim they gave you. if you do give them something, they then complain that it isn't enough.It's never enough.Merchants or their barkers cut you off in front of most souks. No matter what one says to these persistent fellows, they will continue to harass you until a guy from another souk or restaurant takes over. It makes for a very unpleasant shopping experience to say the least.The taxi drivers are thieves with licenses. Though no trip in or around the Medina should cost more than 20DR, we had drivers ask for 200+!The Jamal El Fna is another place you won't enjoy. Walk past the acrobats and you'll be rushed by two or more of the troupe. They won't ask for a donation, they'll demand money! If you refuse they'll probably jeer \"Go home!\"The food stalls offer the same kind of assault and are best avoided.My wife and I have traveled all over the world and we both agree that the red city has little to offer. Prices are as high as most of Spain, conditions are meager at best and there is no beauty there. It's hard to believe that we could spend 6 days (if you have to go, 2 should be tops) in a new land ad find it empty of beauty. Yes, the inside of our Riad was beautiful, but as soon as we stepped through the door of this manufactured loveliness, we found ourselves in a town without natural beauty. None.The other aspect of Marrakech that disturbed us was the undercurrent of animosity shown us and other travelers when we strayed into areas the locals claimed we should not be in. Those areas, by the way were the very neighborhoods where our Riad was located!All in all, if you must find better weather or an exotic destination travel anywhere but this place."

There is no telling what the actual price for the goods are, and you're likely still getting screwed, but enjoy it - Morocco is a poor country, and it won't hurt that much. Be sure to eat the food, it's delicious and plentiful. Go to the bathroom in your hotel or find Les Bains de Marrakesh or La Maison Arabe - these are up to western standards for bathrooms where the rest are not. Also, wear durable shoes that you can get dirty (blood, feces, water, etc will be on the street). This is overall a fascinating place, so just walk around and enjoy it.

Here and there are doors of hidden riads (traditional homes, many of which were turned into small hotels).The main square is a raucous assembly of outdoor food stalls, orange juice sellers, vendors with goods laid out on the ground... and at night add musicians, transvestite dancers and other performers to the mix.Be careful with your belongings, as in any crowded area, and don't spend time looking at an item in a stall and bargaining unless you really want to buy it, as you will not be let go easily.

Not keen on the monkeys and snakes in the square but they are easy to avoid. Obviously if you are in Marrakech you are going to visit the Medina and, on the basis of our experience, there is absolutely no reason not to visit and enjoy the area.

With Africa's busiest Public Square, numerous Souks (lattice-covered market streets) and Palaces carefully guarded, the Marrakech Medina could be 1920 or 1850 if the cars, buses and scooters were prohibited. My fantasy. The big square is a throng of donkey-carts, musicians, Fortune Teller Berber women. Snake charmers and their helpers who will drape a harmless water snake around your shoulders the moment you stop to stare at the swaying Cobras. Fruit sellers and Nut sellers have semi-permanent stands and a fresh squeezed juice is small change. You can rent a carriage and 2 frisky horses for an hour for the price of a decent lunch and trot around the walls of the Medina after you post your cards at the Post Office. In the mid afternoon, cartloads of metal frams and canvas covers begin to erect the night market open restaurants which feed everybody whatever ethnic cusine appeals to them for a good price. The noise is deafening I suppose but around the corner and into a covered street, you can't remember where it was.At night while the Square is still throbbing with life, the streets of the Souks close up and the streets are swept soon to be empty, dark and mysterious. We learned to find a larger street with lamps to get back home to our Riad in the residential area off Dar El Bacha, next to the Queen Mother's Palace, supposedly a pedestrian street but a popular route for scooters, the bain of the Souks.The Medina has become too expensive a place to live for the workers who populate the Souks and shops that line every lane wide enough to permit a stall and a passage in front of it. I was impressed with the lack of cheap foreign-made goods in the Souks. Workshops were everywhere making wooden screens and window frames and doors, traditional footwear, pottery and pictures, dishes and pots and pans. The Museums and historical sites are sprinkled throught the Medina, all within walking distance and every one a lovely oportunity to get out of the sun into the calm of a old Riad or Palace to see the story of the city in photographs and artifacts and costumes. All worthy to visit and most with a quiet place to enjoy a cup of tea preferably Mint hold the sugar! Getting lost in the Medina is an essential part of visiting Marrakech and the friendly people are delighted to help you find your way. Remember that Mosques are not open to non-muslims which is a shame because they are often lovely in their own right."

People do hassle you to buy stuff or eat at their restaurant but generally if you say no they dont pursue you (not like they do in Egypt!) and there are plenty of police in the square at night. Nowadays its more regulated than in times gone by.You do need some coins to give to anyone you do business with whether it be buying something or paying for taking pics etc. They want money for everything but no more than 10 dirhams for a picture. Just stand your ground! And if you don't want a henna tatto you need to be really firm as those women will start to do it even if you've said no so stick your hands in your pockets and walk away - don't debate!For the first visit I advise going up to one of the rooftop terrace cafes and just getting your bearings before you dive in. Cafe Chegrouni is really nice and Cafe Glacier has great views. If you go to Marrakech its a must do."

Positives were that the sites were gorgeous, weather good (day time nice and warm, evening gets a little cold), lots to buy and great places to eat and drink mint tea.Negatives were the constant stream of traffic in really small alley ways, the constant haggling and bartering and pestering of the shop keepers, also be aware of the people who just decide to walk with you and take you places when you look lost-which is frequent sue to the style of the city.Tips: always have change in your pocket rather than your wallet, always avoid beggars, keep bags close and stay together. Never do anything without agreeing a price first and tip everyone who helps 10dh is enough, 20dh they are happy with.The best part was the food.... try mishwe yuuummm"

When you get back from the Medina you will notice your clothes smell especially in the winter. Just smoke, fumes from vehicles big and small, god knows what else. But its the most colorful vibrant place, with everything and everyone! The poorest people in the world then suddenly a women can pull up in a Porche Cayanne and the police watch her car. The shops are cool, the streets that wind all over seem like a giant maze. Cats fighting on the roofs the call to prayer in the Medina is really cool. But most of all I read in a book people will leave you alone if you dont like to be bothered if you have a mission be focused keep walking in one direction and barely glance at things until you feel comfortable. If you see something you want haggle to death for it, but be willing to walk away in a friendly manner.All in all its a fun place but dont let the shear overwelming smells, sounds, activity, and total crazzyness get to you."

Lots of activity, story telling, dancing, and music at night but quite daunting being among those many people. Didn't quite feel safe. Guides will tell you hold on tight to your personal belongings and I believe it. Tours through the market are advised. You could get quite lost very quickly. Guides will take you to their favourite places (commission). Watch the prices. They will try to charge you 40.00 euros for a scarf that you can but at the store for 15.00 euros. If you speak French great but most of the people in the market speak their local language. Probably wouldn't ever go back but glad I saw it once. Quite the experience."

The stall holders will call you in the narrow streets and try to entice you into their shops, many will try very hard to make a sale but on the whole they are friendly and polite so do not pose any threat. We also found that they tend to enjoy haggling with tourists so it is definitely worth it especially as many of the stalls sell identical items so they don't want to lose your custom.

We started on the outer (or more recent) area and wound ourselves into the center (or oldest) areas. We found the most wonnderful place to pick up a quick snack (wonderful Frech pastry and fresh juice). Then we would between the Berber style market area, through the Turkish style area, and then into the Souk (workshop) areas. We wound our way down some familiar passages (neat the tourist area) and then quickly took a few turns to get back into the real Medina. We passed by the oldest (original) restaurant area in Marrakech, where they dropped meat into fire pits in clay pots (old style of BBQ), then wound our way through the huge rug stalls, past the tannery section, and further into the 'organic' produce area, and then into an area reserved for widows who were actually sitting there weaving hats and the like for sale. We learned how the better prices were away from the Market Square and how to haggle for what you want.So far the family has now spent 12 hours roaming around and finding all sorts of novel and unique items and gifts and food.Fabulous to do this with a personal, well respected guide and more than worth the fee for many, many hours of wonderful exploring."

This can become annoying as they can ruin the experience.' i know you, i work in the hotel is a classic, one person will engage in conversation 1st and then 2nd person will try and guide you, another is the person greeting you on the street and offering to walk you to the medina. Don't be fooled only part with your money if you want to give or spend it after all it's your holiday.Also watch out for young children begging by cashpoints."

If this is your first medina, you will have to learn very quickly to avoid eye contact with the merchants and just keep moving unless you really want to buy something. Learn the Moroccan word for \"enough\" and say it forcefully because the word for \"no\" is never sufficient! And be aware that much of the stuff they are selling is from China...don't buy any silver unless it is stamped sterling or you see it being made locally because it may contain dangerous metals!

            "review": "A review and tips for future visitors. Stayed in Marrakesh with a good friend of mine, two young boys in their twenties. Our hotel was located in the new area L'Hivernage, a calm neighbourhood filled with big hotels and bars. It was just a fifteen minute walk to the medina. In this review I'll mention a couple of topics that I think are helpful for future visitors of Marrakesh.Jemnaa el FnaThe square is best enjoyed from a rooftopterrace, while drinking a mint tea. It is very busy and for the salesmen, henna artist and other people you're just a walking ATM. In the evening the food stalls enter the square. I do recommend you to have dinner at a stall, the prices are visible and the food is good (Tip: pick a crowded food stall). The annoying part is finding a food stall you liked, we wielded the following technique: If you're annoying we're not giving you any business. SouksI personally do not like to haggle, so this might explain why I bought the majority of the souvenirs in the Hotel Boutique and Airport souvenirshop (terrible, but true). The haggling wasn't the main reason for the fact that I ended up buying the souvenirs in these locations, the constant pushing by shopkeepers (\"Come have a look at my store\", \"Hello, Hello, my friend) and name calling if you ignored them or said \"no, thank you\" in three different languages (Arab, English or French). Just passing a store and looking at the items caused the shopkeeper to follow you with the items in his hand, for me this does not count as a relaxing shopping experience.SafetyWe, two tall Dutch boys, didn't feel unsafe during the day or at night. Especially Hivernage and Gueliz are safe areas where you will not be harassed and hassled. The Medina is a different place, but other than very annoying we never had the feeling that it wasn't safe. I've read different stories on Trip Advisor, so I think the group you're travelling with a big influence on your perceived feeling of safety. Do not expect anything from the police, since they are hardly visible and I had the feeling that they could do way more to make the stay of tourist much more enjoyable.Drugs While walking on the square or passing a group of young morrocan boys I was offered drugs a couple of times. Just ignoring them or telling them we were from Amsterdam and didn't use drugs so we are not interested in his goods helped. The drugrunners actually were the easiest salesmen to tell that you were not interested, since they are selling illegal products they will not follow you if you've said no.TransportOn the first two days we walked everything, we like to wander around in cities since you're most likely to find fun and interesting parts. I do not recommend this for Marrakech, the slightest hesitation (especially in places near attractions) will cause locals to offer you directions. Saying \"No, thank you\" becomes very annoying at a certain point and caused us to became very distrustful towards all locals who started talking to you within the medina (which is a pity). The complete lack of roadsigns does not help you either. After these two days we started using the cab if we were going to visit the medina. Which turned out to be quite fun, driving through a vegetable market in an old Mercedes while people are buying their daily groceries isn't something you do every day. ConclusionLooking back on the trip I'm glad we made it and went to Marrakesh. At the moment I'm not sure if I would like to return to this city. But if we would go again we would do the following:- Stay in a nice Hotel in the Hivernage district (we were really happy that we made this choice). - Hire an official guide to show you the interesting sights and take you into the small streets in Kasbah and the Medina. The guide will explain the story behind the attractions and you will not be harassed by annoying locals that want money for pointing you in the right direction. Your hotel can help you to find a good guide.- If you wake up easily I recommend you to bring earplugs, since the minarets first call for prayer is really early in the morning (depends on the season). - Take the cab when you're visiting a touristic sight."

The Medina is hell at first and they can spot newcomers a mile off we were approached by many people offering to be guides and even one stall owner yelling at us calling us gays (which we are but no public display of affection) Took a break in a coffee bar then delved in again with much more confidence, main advice would be to not go early (we went in at 9:30 am) as it is very daunting when you are the only tourists walking around the winding streets. By about 11 am there are many other tourists so you feel a lot safer... as for haggling do your research first. They start with super inflated prices and you can be haggling them down to as low as 5% of their original price. Don't be afraid to start low and be willing to start walking away a few times. I was haggling for a tagine and made it out of the shop and away three times before I agreed on a price, and still I think I could have got it down further. Its all a game, good luck :D"

If you stop to look at anything, you are immediately pounced upon and it usually costs you, though not a great amount. My wife happend to stop to look at a man with a monkey and the next thing she knew the monkey was in her arms and pictures were being taken. I had to pay for this and when I gave him a 20 MAD note he demanded more. Nevertheless, the total of 40 MAD amounted to a little over \u00a33."

We spent three days in a beautiful riad in the medina and walked through many times each day. As in any city, you have to use common sense, respect the culture and dress appropriately (women: cover arms, legs and use a scarf to drape over your shoulders - men: shorts are not often seen so will call attention). I found the sellers far less aggressive and persistent than other countries such as Turkey, where they are intimidating and rude. Here our approach was to avoid eye contact, don't point to anything in the shops (that, of course, invites them to try to sell) and smile inanely at them whilst walking by. They quickly lose interest, they don't want to waste their time any more than you do! As a middle aged woman I felt totally safe here and feel much more likely to be a a victim of petty theft walking through the Eastern Europeans who infest Westminster bridge or the pick pockets along the Ramblas in Barcelona! Go to the medina, enjoy the cultural experience, if you want something haggle hard then retreat to a wonderful riad to chill out."

For the first time visitor it can look daunting but here you cross paths with locals leading their every day lives. In many ways it is like stepping back in time. I loved it. Tips? Don't expect to be given genuine directions from locals as they may head you off in the opposite way than where you wish to go! Also do be careful walking around corners as bikes can hurtle past you at an incredible speed considering the narrowness of the small allies. Do savour the atmosphere and take your time exploring."

On our first day left early to find a restaurant away from the hastle and pollution.On the positive side we always felt safe whereever we went.Two or three full days will enable you to do all the sights"

A chemistry of medieval practices delivered to a 21st century traveller are a terrific experience. The work ethic and determination of these traders will humble you. Don't be generous with tips or you will lure a hoard of beggars thinking you are a soft touch. The locals do not want their photo taken, or if they do, they want payment for it. 10 dirhams will do ( 80p). Try eating in the square on a night, the food is good, safe and cheap.Look out for the spice area."

            "review": "Full Blown Tourist Trap. I am really bewildered as to why so many people have rated the Medina in Marrakesh so highly. Any magic that may have existed in the late sixties when Graham Nash et al visited seems to have disappeared and has been replaced by one of the worst tourist traps I have ever encountered. Since it is the main (pretty much only) tourist attraction in Marrakech, the Medina, and especially the Jemaa El Fna square is where most tourists head for. Consequently it seems to have attracted the kind of people whose primary purpose is to extract as much money as possible from unwary tourists.I have been to places in the world where you expect pedlars and street traders to be persistent but here it is taken to a whole new level. Make eye contact at your peril and practice saying \u2018Non Merci\u2019 with attitude. The Jemaa El Fna is full of hustlers, some of whom can be quite aggressive. If you try to take a picture of almost anyone in the square they will demand money \u2013 especially the snake charmers or henna women.I wanted to take a picture of a water seller and agreed to give him 20 Dirhams. After I took his picture he started shouting at me that it was not enough and he wanted 100 dirhams. Sensing that it could get ugly I walked away with him shouting at me but he didn\u2019t follow. Okay, I know it\u2019s a poor country but I found the level of hassle one has to deal with in the square became irritating and tiresome. You are also likely to be accosted by \u2018Guides\u2019 offering to show you round the Medina. Avoid these people at all costs. There\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t find yourself without a decent guide book and if you avail yourself of the services of these so-called \u2018guides\u2019 then expect to be \u2018guided\u2019 to a carpet shop, Argan oil shop or something similar. Yes, it\u2019s busy, chaotic and an assault on the senses as some people have indicated - but not really in a good way. The traffic is insane \u2013 especially in the Square but also in the Souks. My wife got hit by a motorbike whilst crossing the square. The woman riding the motorbike didn\u2019t stop and nobody around seemed to care. Fortunately my wife wasn\u2019t badly hurt although she was shaken. Take care using an ATM in the Medina also. Within seconds on me putting my card in the machine a small child appeared from nowhere with her hand out. I suspect she had been sent over by an adult nearby. Very disconcerting.As some other reviewers have mentioned you really have to have your wits about you to avoid being scammed \u2013 which, sooner or later, you probably will be. Also, as some other reviewers have pointed out, animals are used to \u2018entertain\u2019 the tourists (for money, of course) \u2013 monkeys and snakes in particular. If you\u2019re happy to see animals being abused in this way then okay but I found it disturbing particularly as many of the animals (the monkeys especially) looked to be in very poor condition. I am sure that there are many charming and authentic places to visit in Morocco but the Marrakech Medina isn\u2019t one of them in my view. Any authenticity that still exists has been overwhelmed by commercialism of the worst kind. Compared with the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul (a truly magical city) the Souks were pretty disappointing although at least it feels more authentic and the level of hassle you get seems to diminish the further into the Souks you go. One has to venture deep into the centre of the Souks to find any decent craftwork \u2013 most of the stuff on the periphery being tourist tat.I know that many people will disagree with my opinions but, on the whole, I found the Medina vastly overrated and an unpleasant, dispiriting experience."

This place is really overwhelming!Go suitably dressed, dont take photos unless you are willing to donate to the begging bowl and don't allow anyone to take your hand.The second time we visited the square, we were more prepared, stayed together as a couple and were aware of people hovering, so avoiding potential negative contact. The square is worth a visit - with caution - you should have a lovely time.The rest of the Medina is full of 'hustlers' who latch onto to you when they identify that you are confused and are unaware of where you are. They will take you to 'their shop' to try and get you to buy items - enjoy the experience but, again be prepared. We were very nervous that we might have got mugged or something, but were fortunate that these Moroccans were just doing a job so as they could get commission on what was sold to us.Take a trip around the Medina in a horse drawn carriage. It costs around 150 moroccan for up to two hours. Make sure the horse looks well cared for and that you tell the driver that you only want a tour of the OLD MEDINA - you really don't want to bother with 'New Marrakech' as it is much like any other city!Within the walls of the Medina, is a laberinth of small streets and no where is signposted - that map really is of no use! hahaha! So, enjoy getting lost in this magical space.This really isn't a place for small european children - much too chaotic - but if you want unpredictability, the Medina is the place for you! Check out the museum, the tombs and take in the smells and sounds of Marrakech!"

One seller even offered us free mint tea after we bought a fair few things off of him. Have fun and don't take it too seriously and take time to take everything in.The only advice I would have is don't walk around late at night; we were going back to our riad and some young boys kept running up and touching us (in the end one of them touched my partners bum and she grabbed the boy to stop and I shouted at him in French - needless to say they left us alone after and we spotted a morrocan man telling them off afterwards)."

I loved the spice area for the smells. They sellers are really generous if you take time with them to visit and purchase something. It's why I said to plan to spend more than three hours here. I bought some harira spices and cinnamon sticks for a few dollars and he gave all of my group free Berber lipstick. Be prepared to be called Fatima or Aisha if you are a woman or Mohammed if you are a man. It's the way they get the attention of people they do not know. They are not trying to force familiarity, it is just their way.Be careful of the donkeys and motorcycles because they are not watching out for you! And if you want a picture you may need to ask. Some sellers and people were techty about getting their picture taken (even though we were taking a picture of the donkey and had cropped out the people).I loved it but I can see how some people think it is sensory overload!"

Tip nr one: settle for a price slightly higher then the opening price by returning the first bit by 25% of the original price. Tip 3: If you follow the medina all the way to the north-western most part, you'll notice that more and more tourist make place for locals.. prices drop and the experience becomes awesome.. all the way at the end you can rest a little at terasse des epices... which also offers great meals ..."

Be prepared if you show any interest in an item on a market stall, you will be hassled, so have a price in your head and stick to it. Most of the time you will get prety close to what you are prepared to pay.At night time is when the main square comes alive. If you approach from the main mosque you will see the lights in the distance glowing, hear the noise from all the pipes, and begin to smell the food being char grilled. Once there you will be amazed at just how many people are wandering around as well as dodging the mopeds. If you have the slightest look of a tourist you will be hassled the minute you arrive either by market stall holders or by the even more persistent restauraunt owners. You then have a choice either take it for what it is ,or get irritated. We chose the former. The noise is constant, as is the smoke from all the restaurants. The food is very basic, as are the menus and you don't get that much of a bargain. But hey, your on a different continent so go with the flow. Are we glad we went? Yes. Would we go back again?

Women please watch out.Just got back from Marrakech and read from Cybamuse's comment on 12/21/07 \"You are constantly verbally harassed (with sexual innuendo's) by Moroccan youth\" I regrettably must confirm her claim.The first evening at Marrakech my girlfriend and I were in the medina (the main square) and curious to see the shows people circled and watched. We stood by one of the largest crowds and saw a woman fully covered (include most her face) and swinging her body like belly dancer with the music. I did not see much happening and walked away. However my girlfriend waited for there to be more impressive dance moves since the shaking alone could not get all those local men to stand and watch. Then a few young men stood behind my girl friend's and subtley touched her buttocks with their hands. This happened a few times until she realized what was happening, She turned around and said \u201cGood evening\u201d in French quite loudly and stared the men in the eyes. The stopped for a bit, but continued after she turned around each time. The second night as she was walking (with a long sleeved shirt and fully covered by the way) a young man yelled at her \u201cDo you wanna fxxx? etc.\u201d She looked back at him. He and his friends crowded in on both her and me shouting with anger. They hit her in the face and later they walked away, but one man came back to strongly grab her buttocks again. As she walked away she looked back to see who it was and the young man laughed and waved and flipped her off.  The incident caused me to think:1. What if my girlfriend were alone over there. As it was the two of us were far outnumbered by those young boys.2. If the men dare to act so aggressively, he must know there is a good chance no one would anything to stop him.3. I would not advise any women to go out into the crowds alone at night."

And even with out taking it if you take a picture of it then they will ask you for money.. may be in that case give them 2dirham...obviously they will ask for more then you can walk away..

Keep your camera & wallet safe.... There is a big Mosque near the square.. its old & nice...

The character and atmosphere is like what you would see in an old movie.We were pleased that most of the things for sale in the shops were made locally (sometimes in the back of the shop) and not just Chinese-made trinkets."

It filled with people, noise, smells, motorcycles, donkeys, sellers, restaurants, riads, hammams. It may feel overwhelming to some or absolutely intoxicating. We had chosen to stay in a Riad in the Medina and we were very happy of our choice. It is the place to be, to start and end the end full of life. There is the day experience and the night experience after 7pm. You must try both. Another must is to have a coffee or cold drink from the panoramic terrace of the Cafe de France on Jama El Fnaa place (make sure you seat at the very top level by using a hidden staircase). The view of the Medina is fantastic. It's the best people watching in the world. And make sure to take a caleche and do a full tour (1 hour) of Marrakesh, around 150 diramhs, especially at sunset. Totally worth it."

There is a busy feeling about everything.Streets are really narrow and a smell can envolve you so well that we can dream but it is bad we want to run away and it is not easy.. The riad can be in medina but the you feel a peace living in the riad , lay down in a terrasse and feel the water near you. people are very helpful but there is the hope of receiving money all time. Sorry but it was what I have feel. It is very unique. The colors are really beautifull and make a wonderful journey. That part I love it. Medina looks the place of poor people against the good apartments of nouvelle ville. They are two appart places...it seems to different cities.If I like to live in the Medina I would tell you yes...if i will repeat I don\u00b4t think so. It is an interesting experience for once time.

If you are going to go get a guide, ours was from the tourist office and was 50DM be careful as some of guides want to charge 25\u20ac an hour!

In the evening however, it's all Marrakeshi's and it comes alive with the smells and light (oils,spices, flames, candles etc) of true Morocco. One thing I would say is, don't eat here. The food is very low quality, even in the nicer looking restaurants. Eat instead in the surrounding streets or in one of the amazing restaurants such as the Pepe Nero or the Dar Moha. Also, don't focus to much on the main square itself, use it to explore the surrounding streets, they are far more interesting and you get better, more authentic photos that you won't get charged for . ."

I've been to many places, and this is one of the more aggressive, and often hectic, town centres. It is a once in a lifetime experience, but it is not easy. If you are from the UK or the States, then expect to stand out -- and expect to be approached almost every minute by someone who wants to sell you something, or by someone who wants money. I live in NYC -- I'm used to a fast pace. The medina center is stressful -- more so than I imagined.Either way -- a great experience."

It is such an experience to go. There are many shops in which if you like something, just buy it as you probably won't be able to find it again. Haggling is a must and fun, but can get quite tiresome as they believe foreigners to be rich. Most shops sell tahini pots, argan oil, lamps, bracelets. Be careful not to buy fake argan oil."

The moment your transfer drives through a gate in the centuries-old walls, it's like a switch has been thrown and flipped you back in time 200 years or more. Donkeys jostle with scooters jostle with cars jostle with pedestrians jostle with a man carrying sacks on his back bigger than himself, pushing past an ancient woman selling bread under a shade.No more roads and pavements, just flat space there to be travelled on in any way possible, and none-flat space there to have products fastened to in the hope of a sale at a price yet to be agreed in a ritual repeated a million times a day, every day, since before time was time.If you think you're prepared for your first trip to the Medina, you're not. Every sense will be overloaded, fizzle out, then come back to life reconnected in a slightly different way. The Medina may not have changed for a thousand years or more but everyone who visits it is changed by it, and the Medina is different every day even though it never changes.Some will love it, some will hate it (just read the reviews here) - but underneath it all, this is a relatively safe place with lots of plain clothes police, and every shopkeeper understands that their livelihood depends on people like you coming back time and again - so if it all gets too much, step into a shop and explain your problem - you'll soon see the true hospitality and friendliness of the people of Marrakech (and the next day you'll go back to the same shop and buy something ;) )This is an amazing, unique, fascinating place, and one I can't wait to visit again. My main piece of advice? Don't fight it, let it happen to you, keep a hand on your common sense and enjoy every second - all too soon you'll be home and it'll be a distant memory"

It was mesmerizing with the variety of open air restaurants and the other offerings including boxing of all things. In the evening there were no snakes or monkeys.

This place is not only a UNESCO World heritage Site, but also the most popular touristic area of Marrakesh for both foreign and local tourist. The place in one word is magical and seems it came out from the pages of Arabian Nights, especially at night. During day time, the Medina is full with snake charmers and tribal waterman. Most of the time the snake charmers encourage the foreign travellers to hold snakes for photos. Once photo taken, they start to ask for good amount of money and there is no escape. If you want to take a picture with snake, first fix a price with the snake charmer and then take photo. I have 15 dirham to a snake charmer and took many photos of him with snakes. Same goes with waterman, they also encourage people to take photos of them and start asking for money. But you can still enjoy the place is you keep your eyes open and be bold. At evening the whole medina turns into a magical place with 100s of food stalls. I smell of the food is overwhelming and intoxicating. It is difficult to resist the temptation of trying the foods. So be bold and try anything you like. The stalls sell chickens kebabs, lam kebabs, fish, sea food, vegetables and many more food items. There are few stalls selling freshly squeezed orange juice and they are nice and cheap. Few stall sells snail soup as well. The sail soup stalls are popular among the locals. I will recommend this place strongly as trip to Marrakesh is incomplete without going to Medina. Be hold and enjoy the atmosphere."

Just walking through the archways and past mosques NOT in the souks but in the northern area was a delight, we were not hassled, we barely even got a passing glance from the locals.

We spent a lot of money coming to Marrakech based on the Tripadvisor top ten 2012 traveller choice cities, which placed Marrakech a spot ahead of Istanbul... but it pales in comparison! The jetset are gone and if there ever was any real glamour so has that! The poverty here is staggering, people harassing, sorry i should say begging you for money constantly... everywhere... it is quite sad... if you are able to look past that then you are confronted with filthy neighbourhood after another, rancid smells, piled up rubbish and an unkept environment all around. Prices are on par with other major cities and if i got what other top cities had to offer then i would not mind paying but i didn't... the locals that do not feel the need to harass you are rather nice, gentle and smiley and easy to comunicate with in various languages. The main square J el and is described in many poetic ways in literature but my take on it is that it could be fun if only the locals allowed you to take it in, but vendors clammer over one another to try to get your attention and if they don't get it it turns ugly, they start insulting you and can turn aggressive, even against one another... lots of brawls... The overwhelming number of motorbikes are dangerour and willing to run you over. The souks could be fun too but should you even dare to glance at any item, again vendors will swoop on you and not let it go... and i do not mean like in Istanbul where they will in fact get the hint and back off, these people do not take no for an answer... Perhaps the saddest part are the animals, monkeys that have had their teeth removed and are viciously reprimanded and choked should they not comply with the onslaught of petting and torture... i am a primatologist and it was evident that they were highly disturbed, but you need not be an expert to notice this... you will see starved donkeys being beaten with thick wooden and metal rods... the ones that could not physically go on got the brunt of the abuse... the horses are generally well fed but again nowhere close to being treated well... the snakes do not have it any better either... sheep seemed to be the healthiest of the animals i came across... the dogs and countless cats all look sick and near death... riddled with parasites... it made my heart sink really! :( Most attractions leave a lot to be desired... poorly maintained and overly hyped up. No real entertainment in terms of theatre or spectacle.It is possible to have a good time, just be ready to spend a lot of money, stick to the top 5*L hotels and spas, sip cocktails, ignore the bills, hire luxury cars to take you past the city walls to Majorelle gardens, Ourika valley, the spectacular Ouzud falls and Richard Branson's gem of a hotel well outside of town and tucked away in the mountains (for \u20ac170 they will send a range rover to whisk you away). But then do you really want to spend that much and get so little? This is the most negative review i have ever written and i am sorry for that but i think it is important that you know this so you can be aware of what to expect; a relic of good days gone by but with some potential still there"

The main square is arguably the largest of its kind in Africa and includes men with snakes, others with monkeys (rather sad I think), acrobats and many stalls where you can get orange juice for 4 dirham (a bit watery with some of them), and - in the evening - lots of traditional food. Behind the square, the Souks of Marrakech offer lots of merchandise though I think much of it is not of a great quality, and uninspired nowadays. I saw several traders bringing stuff from China and Europe to their stands. Be prepared to be approached by many traders and to haggle over the prices of the items you want to buy. Best decide before how much you want to spend on any particular item. A good guide for prices can be found on wikitravel.Another characteristic element of the Medina are the many Riads and Dars; traditional houses, sometimes small palaces, that are like oases within the busy city and that are bed & breakfasts, hotels or restaurants. I did not stay in a Riad but it certainly looks very enchanting and I had a lovely dinner in one of them.It is not at all needed to get a guide to explore the Medina. Yes indeed you easily get lost in the maze of little streets but just enjoy and don't worry, you always get out again. I found the entire area safe, and if you don't mind the hassle of the many locals offering you merchandise or services such as giving directions, all is good and great.All in all the Medina is a must see...

Dont be afraid to barter with the market stalls- as they see it as a sport and enjoy the bartering themselves. Be aware that the first price they give you is very inflated, and you should come back with at least half/third of what they ask- then the bartering will begin! Beware of the Henna women who are like vultures- if you are female you will have a really hard time with these, as they grab you and hold on to your hand, and before you know it they have started tattooing it- claiming its free. As soon as they finish they then ask you for money, and follow you until you pay them. We learnt very quickly that they ignored me saying 'no' but they listened to my boyfriend when he said no, and immediately left us alone. Make sure you get a fresh orange juice from the sellers- they are delicious and nothing like the juice I have ever tasted in the UK."

Fortunately for me, they were dead wrong. The medina in Marrakech is a cultural treasure and was the highlight of my entire trip to Morocco. The medina is dirty, convoluted, crowded, and utterly delightful. I found Moroccans to be some of the friendliest people I have ever met. None of the hustlers were pushy to the point of worry or even annoyance. As in any foreign country, be vigilant of your surroundings and use common sense. Be smart, but don't be overly suspicious. Otherwise, what is the point of traveling? Other guests at our riad despised the locals and the bustle and grit of the medina. How sad for them. Go shopping! Talk to the shopkeepers! Bargaining was a very entertaining experience, and not one shopkeeper seemed upset or angry if I lowballed them. In fact, they all took a gleeful pleasure in crossing out their original offers and haggling on price until an agreement was reached with a handshake (and if you are lucky, some hot mint tea). Ask to learn a couple of words in Arabic, and don't be afraid to make friends. You might be very surprised how far it takes you!"

Granted the first night we went to the medina we were a little out of our depth getting grabbed and so forth around the food stalls which I just took as part of the experience ....However my girlfriend decided to dress appropriately covering her head etc and we were not bothered at all for the rest of our holiday. We had done a little bit of research about people giving directions etc and charging money for it which we just always ignored. If you walk with a bit of purpose and don't worry too much about feeling rude by just walking away and not engaging too much in unwanted conversation then you will find the experience fantastic in the medina. I think British people (of which I am one) find it difficult to interact this way. Pick your food stalls from a distance, be polite when looking at goods and just smile and walk away if the price is ridiculous and the prices will drop 50% instantly. ( the same goes for the taxis)If you want a shopping experience minus the \"hassle\" as most people call it then go to Essaouira as you don't get bothered the same way at all.I also found greeting locals with 'salaam alikum' was MASSIVELY beneficial, you seem to get much more respect. When we started trying to engage people this way we never got ripped off for anything. (taxi journeys that started costing 50dh ended up costing 20)Enjoy it!!!!!!"

Our rule of thumb is cut the price given in half, then take 20% off that, then get ready to bargain a bit. And be prepared to shrug and walk away if your price isn't met...they hate to lose a sale and will usually come on down to your price, or close enough. The snake charmers, the henna artists, the people selling snakes and lizards and argan oil and spices and fresh orange juice and djellabahs--whew! It's astounding and exhausting, so when it all gets too much, go to one of the restaurants with a second or third floor terrace and relax over a nice meal. We DID eat dinner from one of the open air stalls in the open stalls of the Jemaa el Fna on our last night with no ill effects, but I was a bit nervous.

You don't need a guide to take you shopping through the souk, but it's worth it to pay a guide a few dollars for the rest of the medina to better appreciate where you are. This place was amazing, it felt like stepping centuries back in time, or a scene from Indiana Jones. From the narrow maze-like alleys, men wearing Berber robes (much like the Jawa outfits), to the donkey carts, spice vendors, figs, dates, olives, snake charmers (Cobras!!), Moroccan lanterns, carpets, stalls brimming with mint, mint, and lots of mint, grilling kebabs, orange juice vendors, musicians, street acrobats--there's a lot to take in. It is worth experiencing the central square (Jemaa el Fna) both in the daytime and at night.If you want pictures with the snakes, expect the \"charmers\" to try to get the equivalent of about $20 from you. Don't feel bad for giving a few dollars instead. $20 is absurd. Don't be taken for a fool. A couple dollars is plenty sufficient, if not too much.We were given advice to watch for pickpockets, so keep your valuables secure and out of sight. We were also warned by the proprietor of the riad we stayed at to avoid food from the open-air stalls in the central square, as he said he's had guests get very sick, even having to go to the hospital. A friend of ours also said the sickest he's ever felt in his life was after eating food from the square, but it was also among the best food he's ever eaten. With this advice in mind, we decided to avoid eating food from the square until our last night in Morocco, figuring that if we got sick, it would be at the end of our vacation. It was cheap, delicious, and we managed to escape any food poisoning. Locals largely dress very conservatively, with many women wearing headscarves. So, while there were many European women wearing very skimpy clothing, it seemed untoward in that environment. While I would wear tank tops and daisy dukes in the States, capris and covered shoulders is probably the skimpiest outfit I would feel comfortable wearing there. I made an exception for a tank top while hiking in the Atlas mountains when it got really hot, and I got some stares. Just something to keep in mind while packing for your trip."

The medicine men and snake charmers and storytellers may want you to pay for pictures of them, but they are charming and selling, and storytelling in Arabic for local consumption as they have for centuries."

This would be a lovely street to shop, there's clothing, food, lanterns and everything you would expect from a Marrakech shopping area, except there is no footpath and legally no public right to walk, it is a road, and a narrow road, and two way traffic is permitted, and for the most part this is a steady stream of mopeds! On my first night one collided with me as he passed by, he wasn't looking where he was going, he was chatting to someone on the otherside of the street! The experience left me shaken.They come through continually and at speed, often on their mobiles, and I even saw one guy texting.It's difficult to stop and look in a shop-sad for the store owners who must lose out as people rush through to the more open 'square'.Certainly would not recommend to families with young children or disabled folk.

Well well well..If you want to buy something it is really impossible here without the \"thrill\" of haggling.Now, I was looking forward to this part but soon it takes its toll. I used to do sales as a living and these people can be quite impossible. Something that should cost 250-300dh they will start at 800 like its fine, so I did same and started at 50dh. They dont like that.Put a price in your head and stick to it,start 60% below and work up gently, they will start to crumble. Not working? Just simply say its above your budget and walk away slowly. They will let you but soon shout you back. When your ready to name your final price offer a handshake and say your price clearly and shake. IF they say anything slightly higher, repeat your price once more and say its final, they will agree.If someone starts at 100dh they will normally accept around 20-30dh. Be strong and uncaring and they will give in.We got lost at one point and between dodging motorbikes and locals I was STRESSED out! But always smile.. that makes the locals think your not lost and don't bother you.Do not accept anything someone gives to you as they will charge, and if anyone offers to take you somewhere or talks as you walk, go away from them as they will expect payment. People offering Henna will try and grab the girls hands and start without talking. A strong NO does the trick. Remember, no matter where you are from no one can touch you without permission and let them know this.Its a place you HAVE to go... but also a place you have to not spend long in as it does get very stressful.Learn some basic French as it will serve you well! No Merci is one I said a lot.So if you are gonna go for it, hard hats on, chest puffed out, protect girls you are with as men Lear at white girls and go out and go for broke and enjoy the sights in front of you!"

If you want anything authentic then stay away from Marrakech. If you think visiting this city makes you 'cultured' or experienced in the orient way of life you are mistaken. As Edward Said once said, reverse Orientalism is now coming true. Where people of the orient are turning back to strong stereotypes of themselves in order to benefit. Either from tourism or something other. Marrakech is as authentic as tortillas are mexican. Ok not great example but yes.The main square where you end up - is it. It is the place for everyone with foreign currency to gather and blow their money. During the day it is so hot you cant walk around so you end up lost in the covered markets. Everyone wants something from you and will not always be polite. We avoided certain streets after passing them once as people remember you and come after you.We once had a child who followed us begging for money for a good 20 mins. She just had her hand up looking for money and refused to leave. She was then joined by her sister who both followed us without mercy. Ignore them and NEVER make eye contact. If you think you're helping a poor child you are greatly mistaken. This is part of a larger criminal organisation and these children are the front for collections. During the night the food market can get hectic. I quite enjoyed the chaos but once you have eaten do NOT walk inside the foot stalls area. Everyone will have their menu in your faces. I politely declined each offer by saying i have already eaten and that seemed to work. What was offensive was how people would chant things to you in a language they believe you understand. I am brown but i'm not Indian. After hearing this 10 times it became old and quite frustrating. I dislike this treatment and its not because im a sensitive person but because basic mannerism just is void in marrakech.Food here generally is rubbish outside of the market. Thats my personal view. Not a fact. After seeing 5 cities in Morocco marrakech was my least favourite. If you want to go somewhere go to Fes. The tourist police are very active so you are not bothered and can enjoy yourself down streets and markets and talk to who you want to talk to."

Same goes for the \"guides.\" There are two types: those who want to guide you in order to get a commission on the items you buy; and those who want to charge you for guiding you to certain landmarks. The former aren't too bad -- we were taken interesting places -- to the textile dyers, to the women who grind argan, etc. The latter are like the snake charmers and their ilk in Jemaa el Fna -- once you ask for directions they'll run ahead of you to guide you. The only way to avoid being harassed to pay an exorbitant \"guide\" fee is to negotiate a fee for giving directions -- thus, we paid the equivalent of 2 euros instead of 20 euros. We found the best people to ask for directions were the older men, preferably not proprietors of shops. They were friendly, gave directions without harassing us for money -- just nice people."

Its an unpleasant place if you like animals. We ate at the food stalls, didn't get any problems, but orange juice tasted \"off\" and watery. Took our own cultery,plates, straws, napkins everywhere we went and would advise this as a precaution for health and safety! Food not good value including the famouse No1 Ayisha's stall- would get more and better in London for the price. Stall holders as too be expected- pushy and vaguely aggressive, and alot of tat there too. Spice exposed to the elements, so who wants them then? Don't forget if you buy in a shop, you get a receipt and if you spend over 2000 Dirhams collectively you can claim 13% tax back, and the shops are not more expensive than your eventual price in the Medina."

            "review": "Greed and intimidation and cons. I realise that I am probably in a minority of people who commit their negative impressions of the Medina and main square of Marrakech to a review, but I am going to anyway on the basis that perhaps more travellers will be better informed when they go to this place.The Djemaa el Fna is one of the busiest trading squares in Africa, and is essentially the place that you will probably end up spending a lot of your time in if you take a trip to Marrakech. There is a day and night market, the day is mostly orange juice and dried fruit sellers, the night is the food market with lots of acts such as snake charmers, monkey ... keepers? etc etc.Here are my impressions:Greed - Everyone wants something from you. Literally, everyone that you meet or interact with would like some of your money. Sometimes for a product or service, sometimes for nothing at all . Another reviewer has put it more eloquently than I could here http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g293734-d324126-r130611838-Medina_of_Marrakech-Marrakech_Marrakech_Tensift_El_Haouz_Region.html#REVIEWS but I will do my best to add what I can.Young men - will offer you directions or some sort of advice, and even if you politely decline, will demand (Yes, demand) money from you. If you give them something, hoping that they will go away and leave you alone, they will look at it in contempt, and say that it is 'nothing ... baby money' and wait for more. There is a very sinister undertone, this on it's own, once it has happened a few times, is enough to ruin your experience. I would not go back to Marrakech ever again, mainly for this reason. If the 'tourist police' (Where they were I do not know) do not deal with this problem, I don't think Marrakech has a very good future as a tourist destination of choice.The thing to note here as well is the fact that the people who give you the most trouble, are not the most needy. They are well dressed young men, not the really poor blind and lame beggars who abound throughout the city. There was one particular instance when my girlfriend and I were walking back to our Riad, and we were offered directions to it (It was only a few hundred metres away) by two young guys. I stupidly said ok, just to get them off our backs, and when we got to the door, they demanded 200 Dirhams (About \u00a315) each for the help (Hourly rate in Marrakech is about 12 Dirhams per hour) Then, the two became 5, as three more materialised out of nowhere and also started asking for money .... I said no to all of these, and gave 20 Dirhams to the first two. One looked at it in disgust, and (as I had come to expect) told me that this was nothing, and that I should pay more. It was a very uncomfortable situation, and my girlfriend and I stood there, surrounded in a deserted alley, hoping that someone would come to the door soon, before these guys stopped asking 'nicely'.The kids - Lots of little children who will follow you about and ask for cash ... perhaps for a trinket or toy that they are selling. I am sure that there are more sinister adults behind them, making them go and beg, but to give them cash just makes it worse, as more and more will seemingly see that you are a soft touch and come to you asking for more. They are very persistent and you have to say 'no thanks' about 8 or 9 times on average before they will give up.The taxis - Insanely greedy, and outside of the friendly barter system that everyone seems to think is the norm in Marrakech. Example - we got lost (Big mistake, but totally inevitable in a city that must have only about 3 or 4 street signs in total in it!) trying to get to Kosy Bar ... hailed a taxi and asked how much to get to Kosy Bar (A very well known bar near the Place de Ferblantiers) \u00a350 Dirhams, was the answer. Way too much, but he, maybe its miles away. Got in, and drove aimlessly for 5 minutes, until the driver turned to us and said ..... \"Kosy bar? What is Kosy Bar??' Turns out that it was only a few yards from where we were standing when we got into the cab.Con Men (And women)Ah the hubbub of the square. Largely made up of the following -Henna tattoo women - who will aggressively grab any girl's hand and try to start working on it before being given consent to do so. Will offer a 'free sample' and then immediately demand money from you for it. Avoid them.Various animal keepers - snakes and monkeys etc. Will catch you unawares and drape a snake around your shoulders, ar plonk a monkey in your arms. Will then immediately demand an outrageous sum of money from you for this.People dressed as Berbers .... wait to see you get your camera out to take a picture. Will grab the camera, and take pictures of you that you didn't ask for. Our one started by saying ... 'don't worry, it's free!!\" and then aggressively demanded 100 Dirhams for his time. Gave him 20 dhs, about the equivalent of an hour or more work for 30 seconds, and he looked at it in disgust, and said that it was nothing. When it was pointed out that he told us it would be free anyway, and if the money was 'nothing' then why not give it back, he went off muttering what I can only assume were unpleasant things in Arabic under his breath. The souks - Actually not as bad as the main square, surprisingly. Yes, everyone wants your business and will ask for it, and yes, you will need to haggle, but I think because of the number of police that are in plain clothes in the Souks now, to make the shopkeepers less aggressive with tourists, this was the most enjoyable part of the medina.The drugs - I was offered 'Great Hash' at least 10 times in my time in or near the square. This was usually at the same time as having money demanded from me for nothing. Great to see so many drug dealers in a tourist area - really gives you confidence!Well, I think that just about wraps it up .... it's a great shame too, as the real locals seem like nice people, and Marrakech is undeniably a beautiful and ancient city in its way - it is just a pity that 1% of the population seem determined to wreck the experience for anyone who comes to visit. The King of Morocco pledged to attract I think 10 million tourists to the country to boost the tourist industry and improve the lives of Moroccan people .... he may well achieve this, but if this behaviour is allowed to continue, many of those people, including myself, will not be going back again.

Oh, and add to that cheating, lying, Baksheesh, ignorance and a culture that has gone way wrong.In a way the Medina reminded me of Montego Bay , Jamaica years ago when the cruise ships used to dock regularly. They stopped visiting Montego because it was unsafe and the residents were so overly aggressive that nobody was comfortable and no one wanted to visit and shop. We were there 6 or so years ago just after the ships stopped coming and the merchants were starving. Tourism was dead.and nothing was selling. I see this in the future for Marrakech.You cannot go ten feet without someone in your face being very aggressive. We were in Istanbul 10 days last May and the Grand Bazaar has some pushy salesmen but nothing compared to the souks of Marrakech..Examples:First day - We stopped at an orange juice trolly in Jamaa El Fna .. I had no dirhams so I went an ATM and get all shiny new 100 dirham bills. We went back to the the orange juice stand. the OJ cost 8 dirham and I gave him a 100. He gave me back 12 dirham in coins and went on to the next customer. I knew there was something wrong but it took me a while to read the coins so I ask for the rest of my change. Reluctantly he gave me back 60 dirhams. Still wrong!!! I insisted and after a long hesitation he gave me back 20 more dirham, Not a spot of embarrassment or shame on his face.Taxis - I asked a taxi driver how much to a particular hotel.? He said 13. I wrote the number on my open palm with my finger, he says yes, 13. when we arrive he says no it's 30 not13 . What can you do, call the police??? We paid.Candy stand - My wife wanted a taste - just a small taste of a bit of fudge from a street vender so we agreed on 3 dirham for a tiny piece. I give him a bill and he give me change that was not even close. I objected and he grabbed the change, switched the dirham coins for euros and shamelessly says that the change was correct. My God, do they think we are stupid???That's not the worst of it. The worst is the kids, unbelievably -- the children. When you get lost in the souks( note - when, not if, you get lost because you WILL get lost ) you will have a confused, maybe worried look on your face. In a very short time a young man in his early teens will appear and offer assistance or to show you around. When he shows you to your place he will ask a ridiculous amount of money and by implication cause a fuss is not paid. Most pay. One kid whom I had told to get lost was so insistent he followed us home and when I offered 10 dirham just to leave, he said it wasn't enoughOne of the little boys on our street to whom i gave candy announced the next day I had to buy him a soccer poster. Just Because. A merchant close to where we were staying whom we saw every day stood in my path one day and said I should gift him the Brazil soccer shirt I wore the day before. Asked why, It was Just because, no other reason. Just Because.And on it went.They were otherworldly in their persistence and the conviction that they should have your money. Truth did not seem to matter. I've read about this huge cultural gulf , About the Arab / Bedouin mindset and the effect of Islam (we are the infidels) and but I thought in 2012 this would be gone. Unfortunately all the negative stereotypes came vividly to life.So, what to do?Get everything in writing. Negotiate every little thing first. Carry a pad of postits and write fares, prices , everything down so you don't cheated - including the teens in the souk. Don't get intimidated. There are tourist police to protect you. Inform your intimidator that you know about the police."

            "review": "The Red City Medina. The Medina of Marrakesh is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and not to be excluded from any trip to Marrakesh. It is absolutely amazing! The entire medina is walled in red mud brick. There are so many highlights it is hard to pick just one. The main square is Place Djemma-El-Fna. In the square you will find makeshift dentists, snake charmers, henna artists, fascinating storytellers and the Coke bottle game. There are vendors of anything and everything and the orange juice sellers. This is just the daytime. The night time is even better. Just before sundown the food stalls begin setting up tents and makeshift restaurants. The food was eclectic and delicious. I didn't try the sheep brains though and I am an adventurous eater. Drummers and chanters, monkeys, donkeys whirling traffic,horse-drawn carriages, scooters everywhere, traditional costumes, smiling people. Djemma-El-Fna is an assault on all of your senses. Yes there are touts and beggars and you will have to pay to get a picture of the snake charmers but it is only a few Dirham. You will never see anywhere else like this in the world. The square is surrounded by restaurants and the terraces above have a commanding view over the square. I had my first mint tea of many and my first tajine in the square. Both incredible! The view to Koutabia Mosque and the towering minaret are also a highlight. So after all of this, and you can spend hours here just watching, you have just made your first few steps into the medina. Adjacent to the square are the souks. They are another assault on your senses, almost literally. They begin fairly wide and as you make your way through the winding derbs they get narrower and narrower and branch off and back in to each other. Getting lost is advised! Everything is for sale. Do watch your purses and wallets however. Buying items in the souk is a great experience. You have to be a good haggler or at least enjoy the experience of it. It is customary and expected. You will be asked where you are from, do you need a carpet, would you like some tea, do you need a carpet, taste some herbs, have some more tea, do you need a carpet? I bought a teapot and some candleholders and had a sensational time with the seller. He spoke four languages and I do too but barely any of the same. I spent three hours in the same shop and had an incredible conversation in a mixture of four languages and hand signals and lots of mint tea. I went back again the next day and got more presents. He had seen me coming through the souk and had a platter of tea waiting. What an experience. The medina also has a few palaces, El Bahia and Badii Palace. Both are worth going to. Storks inhabit the outer walls of Badii palace and seeing their nests is a major draw. The Saadian tombs are located in the Kasbah area of the medina. It was so crowded when I went it was hard to move around though. I would recommend going in the morning or if you see a tour bus move onto El Bahia Palace as they are fairly close together. The Kasbah area has a lot of good restaurants and coffeeshops, lots of stores too and the Imperial Palace is also in this area of the medina. The whole medina has lots of stores in general. The tanneries are in the back section of the medina away from the more touristy areas. Any of the neighborhood kids will take you there for a few Dirham. Bring fresh mint with you! The Ben Youseff Medresa was an Islamic school and should be on everyone's list. I don't know how to get there as I almost stumbled on it but again getting lost in the medina is recommended. The Museum of Marrakesh and the Photography Museum, housed in beautiful riads, are very close to the medresa and the Photography Museum has a cafe and a terrace from which you can overlook the medina and a bathroom. It's a great museum with some amazing photographs of Marrakesh from years ago as a trade route for caravans crossing the Atlas mountains from the Sahara. Accommodations in the medina are the riads and there are hundreds to choose from. I stayed in one for my last two days in Marrakesh and was pampered with tajines and a hammam. It was two days of utter relaxation and is a welcomed respite from the chaotic alleys outside of them. I did not visit the Mellah, the Jewish quarter of the medina, but had read that there is a fascinating synagogue there. There are several imposing gates into the Kasbah and Medina and they make great photo ops as well. Any trip to Marrakesh without visiting the medina is a mistake and this will be the highlight of your time there."

The souks are all under cover, however they are made up of tiny alley ways and mopeds and motor bikes ride up and down and there is very littel room so you are often jumping out of the way or falling in a doorway to avoid being run over as they dont stop for pedestrians! Never agree to the price a trader says, you must go in with a price a lot less. Don't be afraid to say something ridiculous, but ensure you know exactly how much you want to spend and if you cant agree then walk off. They will either run after you or you will find the same goods in one of the others. I bought a small handmade rug and got the price slashed by half. They are still making a profit so stick to your guns, you should go in with at least a 60% less price and go from there. never shake hands until they say the price you have agreed on either. We didn't eat in and around the Medina as there was an awful smell of drains and dirt, but we saw plenty of tourists eating from stalls and sitting at long tables with cooked food. Spices are a good buy, you can get almost anything. 50g was the minimum you could purchae we found, our friends bought cinnamon sticks and 35 spice which was so fragrant. The whole Medina and souks is a must see!"

And yes, the salesmen would offer you to enter their shop. But only once in a week did I experience that a friendly \"Non, merci\" was not respected. Enjoy your stay in the Medina!"

Narrow alleys with houses built of clay, hiding the most amazing courtyards in the riads with beautiful tiles, amazing carvings and blue pools. Also you will find yourself getting lost in the souk - where no map will be of any help.Traders will sell you things you have never seen or heard of before - or actually, a visit to the spice souk with the Berber pharmacies will actually reveal what myrrh and frankincense is. The smell is fantastic.Is probably for a more seasoned traveller as you will be chased by sellers, snake charmers, unlicensed guides for the first couple of days until you get the proper glased look which will turn away any shopkeepers. Arkwright would have a good run for his money in this place."

Its an amazing melting pot of colour, smell and noise. Just go with it, you will eventually get out, but a tip, dont stay too late or you may get locked in, gates close around 8 PM.Be careful of slick young men offering to 'help' you find your way back to your riad/hotel. They appear very friendly until the money demand comes, then they can be quite aggressive if you dont give them what they think its worth to get you back.Ask a shopkeeper for help if you need it, I found most were very helpful when we did get lost."

On arrival we had to get off the coach outside the walls as coaches are not allowed in. Once inside it is very vast, there are stalls for everything and it would be easy to get lost. We had two guides our tour guide and a local guide who kept us altogether. There was little problem with the stall holders or beggars. Beware of the snake charmers as if you want a photo with a snake you have to pay to get it off and they never have any change, its best to have small change and pay first saves a lot of hassle. This tour took in many other places. the downside was we visited a non working Mosque which was just a bare room a great pity as we have been to many Mosques thoughot the world. There is a law in Marocco that prohibs visits to Mosques except for prayer. A visit to the Madina is a must together with a visit to MarraKech."

            "review": "Surviving the Marrakech Medina!. My husband and I visited the medina/souk/square of Marrakech in February this past year. I thought I might put together a \"tips\" review of our experience that may help future travelers.(We are experienced travelers, not scared off by a little adventure!)The SouksAs EVERY reviewer will tell you...you better put your best haggling hat on. Prices in the souks are often marked up by HUNDREDS of percent. They sell 5 types of goods in the medina/souks - Leather Goods, Rugs (EXPENSIVE), Lanterns/Metal work, Tagines/Pottery & Spices - so the competition is fierce, and the shop owners are very persistent in getting you into their shop.If you look...be prepared to be lead inside! The souks in the square are ENDLESS and there are often \"recruiters\" standing on the outskirts ready to lead you deep into the maze to \"help\" you find a particular good. If you are lead in by someone, the item/s you ultimately purchase WILL be marked up to tip the \"recruiter\". They are not helping you out just to be friendly, they are earning a living. YOU CAN GET LOST inside...and better believe it's going to cost you to get out if you need directions! There are lots of shops outside the official \"souks\", many with better prices and even some along side streets that are marked with prices.It is also considered rude by many to take photographs of someone's shop without their permission. I found if I purchased an item (that I already wanted) from a shop owner, I would kindly ask their permission before leaving to take a few pictures of their \"beautiful shop\". This small courtesy is appreciated.The Square1 word - CHAOS! Motorcycles whizzing by nonstop, horses and donkeys pulling carts, snake charmers, monkey on leashes, performers...it is a CIRCUS! I found we could only handle the main square in small quantities. Again - as far as goods sold, it is VERY repetitive and the merchandise is nearly identical shop to shop. So it can be tiring saying \"no thank you!\" 1000 times in a row. I recommend taking a day to wander around (don't linger too long!) looking at the goods for sale, and come back a day later to make your purchase after you've had a good look around, and again - don't be afraid to haggle!! They are expecting it!In terms of food...eat at your own risk! Everyone's stomach is different, but if you're not the adventurous type, check out some of the fresh baked bread and freshly squeezed orange juice. It is delicious and incredibly cheap!Be VERY careful taking photographs! The snake charmers, monkey handlers, and other performers will approach you with big smiles and open arms for photos, then will turn on a dime if you are unwilling to pay the sometimes extortionate rates for a photo, and can be very aggressive. They are not afraid to demand 20eu or more for just ONE picture. We were approached by a group of 4 men with leashed monkeys, and before we knew it...all FOUR of them were on us, and the men had our camera taking pictures. Once our camera was returned (I was ready with cash for them, but had not anticipated so many!) I was told it was going to be 200dh PER MONKEY. They wanted nearly 80EU/100USD for those pictures, and were EXTREMELY offended by the amount we offered them (60dh each). I later spoke with a shop owner we came to know who laughed HYSTERICALLY at the notion of paying 200dh for a picture, and said they often BUY the monkeys for less than 50, and can live a WEEK on 200dh, so do not be fooled by the feigned offense and stand your ground!The performers and handlers are also VERY aware of having their picture taken from afar, so unless you are at a good distance (try one of the terraced restaurants with a 2nd floor!), be prepared to be approached demanding payment for the photo you took!Cabs/TransportWe found walking to/from the medina to be very easy. If we weren't fussed with making our way through the madness of the main square, we found cabs to be readily available during the day and you can get anywhere in the Medina area for about 30-40dh each way. SafetyWhile we never felt unsafe during our trip, there were definitely moments (day and night) where we were harassed in one way or another. As a young woman, I got more than my share of \"unsavory\" comments (in english too!) while I was walking around...fully dressed in conservative clothes WITH my husband. Did not make a difference. Best to just hold your head high, ignore it and keep on walking! Common sense will tell you not to wear flashy jewelry and keep cameras and wallets safely tucked away. I found it best to carry small chunks of cash in my pocket, instead of my wallet (100dhs broken into 20s) for tips and small purchases, so I did not have to pull out my wallet and show a huge wad of dirhams (not alot in USD but a TON in dhs)and draw unwanted attention, or potentially raise the price of the item!For an escape, I HIGHLY recommend visiting the outlying palaces and gardens. They are truly beautiful, admission is no more than $1 or 2 and the scenery is beautiful and QUIET. It's well worth it to duck away for a little R&R.Overall - I truly enjoyed Marrakech. Even for an experienced traveler, it takes a little getting used to to find your way around and adapt to the way of life. It is a beautiful place with lots of lovely people, but is definitely not for the faint of heart!!!"

And never far away is the Djamm al Fna, the fantazim where commerce, art, folk practices, theatre, talent, hucksters and ecstasy meet.

I was looking forward to relaxing and getting away from work, exploring the markets, eating good food. Unfortunately, this has been a terrible holiday. The first day, we headed into the central market and the souks. We were able to shrug off being pestered, but then we got terribly lost in the souks and ended up in some exceedingly dirty streets selling food that smelt very off. People were pestering us to sell us the way home, which we eventually found by ourselves. After that, people tried to sell us pictures with monkeys, and a lady asked and asked and asked if I wanted a henna tattoo, I walked away and she drew on me anyway. It was all a little upsetting. The whole experience has been awful, people only want to sell you things, if you say no, they try again and again, I just end up getting a little cross. I won't be going here again, it's been madness to say the least. Im looking forward to getting on that plane...thank god we only booked five days!"

We visited the square four times on our three day visit to Marrakech, both during the day and in the evening (when we ate, too)The square is like nowhere I have ever been, bustling with life, with people in traditional dress alongside the younger people who by and large are in western clothes all going about their business. Yes, there are scooters everywhere, but while they are alarming at first, and you need to be sure to keep away from what seems to be an unofficial road running through the Medina, the riders are skillful and will avoid you! (and it is fascinating to watch them drive the scooter, with a passenger on the back (frequently she is holding a baby too!) while they text and maybe hold on to their shopping. All done with no crash helmets!) The stalls and souks round the square are fascinating to visit and to shop in.You seem to be able to buy pretty much anything, although handbags (Morrocan leather and fake designer) and shoes seemed to predominate around the edges. The stallholders hassle you to buy, but they are friendly and want to talk to improve their English. You have to barter, but we found we got a better price if we just walked away - they followed us lowering the price at every step!During the day, the square is filled with attractions such as snake charmers, at night, stalls for eating are set up and the sky is alight with blue flying toys. It would appear that some of the stall holders would accept payment in Euros as well as the local currency.You pay a premium for a soda to drink while you sit in one of the balconied cafes to watch the activity in the square but it's worth it. I wouldn't recommend eating in those cafes though - we did and got overpriced westernised food which was very disappointing. If I went again, I'd try the stalls in the market to eat at night or maybe go into the souk area a bit deeper to find somewhere there.It would be nice if there were decent toilet facilities available. I used a few in the cafes which varied in quality, if you see what I mean. But I guess that is part of the 'charm' of a visit to a place like this!I would certainly go back if I ever find myself in Marrakech again. It is the heart and soul of the city and if you like shopping - it's bliss!"

I have found that just randomly walking around once I am lost, I find things that I would never have come across if I was sticking to the normal paths. The people are very friendly and if you want to get back to the main square then just ask one of the shopkeepers the general direction you should be going in, they will all tell you the way. Try not to ask one of the children or somebody who is just \"hanging around\", if you do, then the chances are they will show you the way and ask for a payment at the end (even if you have not agreed to pay them at the start).A great place to explore, it is like going back in time by a few hundred years, I love exploring the medina, it is very big and you will always find a new place to go there.

We came home after just one night, please be aware of what you will be experiencing if you plan to stay in a Riad in the medina.On the hotel, it was rated as 4 star but we would have placed it around a low 2, the ceiling fan was nearly falling down , one light fitting was totally hanging from the ceiling, the bedside lamp was faulty, the bed was ok and it was a clean room, although we didn't get clean towels as you would expect from a 4 star hotel.It was a very poor area and poverty at a level we have never seen in our lives. There was not one redeeming feature for us. If you want to see how fortunate we are to live in UK this must be the place to go. We were just happy to get back even though we lost the Holiday and the \u00a3600 we paid to go .There were plenty of happy people on the flight home that seemed as though they had enjoyed it but I guess they were not in the Medina or they enjoyed feeling like a rich Westerner.

Perhaps it is because the sheer volume of visitors makes the stall holders feel they must compete but they are altogether less friendly or amenable, verging occasionally on being unduly aggressive and pushy. Its also not an easy place to walk around like Fez due to the motor cycles which go at break neck speeds. It was the one place where when 2 of us females went out alone we were treated with with behaviour which was at best indifferent and at worst contemptuous. References were made to one of us maybe being Jewish and hating Arabs. Both of us have had experience in similar enviroments, but this felt uncomfortable. the night life in the square, and street stalls for eating were great - some of the best food we ate during the tour"

I had not expected a place so in your face.Marrakech is like a street market on hallucinogens. I have been to markets all over the world, but I have never known a city which is almost one endless market. The tourists souks selling textiles, lamps, shoes, carpets and more merge into stalls selling foods, spices and clothes to the resident population. The maze of alleys and streets is confusing - even with a map - a compass on my phone seemed the best way to navigate. There are of course the many people offering you guidance back to your Riad or the central Place - but you need to pay them.The experience is intense and there seems no escape from the noise and smells and people. The people of the Medina often seem intolerant and aggressive - especially when you try to take their photos. But , when you take the time to visit their shops, they are always interesting and often extremely hospitable.The Riads of Marrakech, both those converted to Hotels and B&Bs, and those that have been reserved as museums - seem a world a way from the bustle of the Medina. In these Moorish palaces, you feel at complete peace and in touch with the stunning art of a special people.Marrakech is a unique world of its own. Even other Moroccans we met outside of the city looked at it with a sense of bafflement. Prepare yourself for an adventure."

We got sick and tired of having arguments with them, as they tried to follow us, and lead us the wrong way - so you feel more grateful when you eventually get there - no amount of \"non merci\" had any impact on these boys. Then when we had decided to let one show us the way he demanded ten euros for the service at the end and was threatening to us, in front of our three year old daughter, who got extremely upset. Wandering in the medina was a great experience at times, but more often stressful and unenjoyable.

But then when I took Therese's advice that it's a kind of game, I was able to relax and enjoy the give and take. If you want pristine paved streets and orderly behavior, you can visit any one of a number of cities anywhere in the world. But if you really want to experience something like nowhere you've ever seen, go to Marrakech and experience the Medina."

I don't think there's any need for a map of the medina, unless you really want to get to a specific shop or cafe and even if you do, one of the local boys will show you the way, in exchange for a few dirhams. You've got the time, you can just wander around an eventually you'll work out where everything is. If I ever did get lost, I would note the direction of the shadows and then always walk in the same direction in relation to the shadows, at least then you know you probably won\u2019t go round in circles!Spices are marked up per kilo, sometimes the stallholders in the centre of the medina will tell you that this is the price per 100g! I went to the local shops on north and towards the edge of the medina, I know that some of the purchases were underweight, but I think that even though I paid more than a local person, the quality will be better than at the spice stalls which are aimed specifically at tourists. Whatever you might want to buy in the medina; spices (e.g. paprika, harissa, ras el honout, lavender, linseed, saffron, turmeric, nigella seeds), alum rock natural deodourant, incense sticks, silk scarves, rugs, wooden toys and instruments, tagine, etc, it\u2019s worth investigating the price in the UK before you go so that you don\u2019t get swept away in the moment when haggling. I found that if I wanted to get away from a shop without buying something, I would politely offer an extremely low price, then only budge by a few dirhams and the stallholder would realise that it wasn\u2019t worth continuing the conversation and it was easy to walk away with pride and good humour intact on both sides.As a woman travelling on my own I had no trouble at all. I wore long sleeves and long trousers at all times, although there\u2019s no need to wear a headscarf. The locals in the medina are overwhelmingly young men and I found that they were polite and mainly just wanted to exchange a few words, a polite \u201cbonjour\u201d or \u201chow are you?\u201d. If we want the waiters and shopkeepers to be able to speak a foreign language, this is the way that they are going to learn. Once I had worked out where my hotel was in relation to the medina I was happy to walk around on my own at night."

All the little stalls / shops and alley ways where getting lost was a very real possibility!After a while, you realize everyone is selling the same stuff, but this does not take the enjoyment out of looking. The Medina is fasinating, ever changing. Everyone hawking their wares and trying to make a deal with you. Bartering is par for the course, but don't make a deal, have the seller agree and then not buy. This is not only rude, but insulting to the vendor. Most vendors do not like their picture being taken, or want money if you do take it. There are some great restaurants in the Medina, along with some very unique stores / stalls.One word of caution - watch out for the motorcycles (and your handbags as well!)"

You can stroll around and some of the things you will see will blow your mind. All of your senses will be used, the sights, the smells, the hussle and bussle of the place is just extra-ordinary. When you are strolling around it is like you have been taken back in time. You can spend hours walking and looking around, there are hundreds of photo opportunites and some of the architecture will inspire you. Be confident and if anyone approaches you and tells you they will show you around then just tell them you dont need any help, else at the end they will demand money off you and this may spoil you experience. Be strong and tell them you dont need their help, even if you get lost you will eventually find you way out (getting lost is one of the best things as it almost always takes you to parts of the medina that you would not ordinary have seen)."

First time for me to see the snake dance (even though they were just standing or lying down as weather was probably too cold for them), you have to pay if you want to take picture with snakes wrapped around your shoulder (it was $300) for one person and we bargained to $200. During the day, it's mainly for shopping and seeing those performances, and in the evening, those will be replaced by food stalls, so you can just have dinner there. We even tried the snail soup (taste a bit weird for us), the stall with lamb meat & a sheep head - it was just really tender lamb meat, was sooooo good!) and all the local stuff :-) It was quite an experience. Keep in mind they don't use forks but only their hands for eating, so if you really mind then you should bring along your own utensils when eating in local food stalls. *Orange (or probably Mandarin Orange) juice is a MUST - only $4 each and taste so so good!"

The best time, however, was when we went at \"off peak tourist times\" (i.e. in the evening) and wandered into areas where locals shop. Don't worry about getting lost - if you orient yourself to Djemaa El Fna and the Koutoubbia Mousque, it's fairly easy to find your way around. You will definitely get tons of people calling to you to buy things, which does get old after a while. It helps a lot to learn the basic phrase \"laa, shukran\" (no, thank you) and smile - be polite but stand your ground. Also, don't listen to boys who tell you that the streets ahead are closed - they are just looking to take you back to the main plaza for a few dirham. All in all, a must-do in Marrakech."

We stayed at Riad Lakhdar which is a short walk from the square and souks. It is interesting to visit these more outlying areas as they are (slightly) less touristy and you can see and meet locals. A visit to the fixed price super store - Bouchaib in Rue de la Kasbah is a must (just south west of Badi Palace). It gives you the best idea of what to pay in the market and is often cheaper anyway. It also has an amazing variety and quantity of stock - mind blowing. Walk back to Fna Square through the Jewish quarter souks. Avoid the annoying guides by saying you want to get lost or simply walk away from where they direct you. They will ALWAYS want money for \"helping\". The beggar ladies are just about always 'actors\" and go home to bed after their days \"work\". Donate to the disabled - they probably need it. If it all gets too much take a walk or taxi to the French quarter north of the medina at the Plaza on Ave Mohammed V (where Mcdonalds is). Up there is a more modern cosmopolitan Marrakech - even alcohol in the restuarants! Absorb the Medina atmosphere - there is nowhere else like it!"

I didn't mind the constant bustle, sounds and smells. In fact, that added to the fascination and interest of the place.Unfortunately it is deeply marred by the constant demands for your money. It's not just the regular hawking and demands I've found at any place that is a tourist destination in a developing nation. That is expected when the differential between the wealth of the visitors and the residents is large. For that matter, there are tourist traps and demands for tourists' money everywhere in the world, no matter the nation.But Marrakech felt like it added a new dimension to this. Perhaps it was aggravated by the fact we were still jet lagged, or that Marrakech is not a quiet place, but let me recount a few experiences:* at one point we were lost (well, several points) and were quickly approached by some older kids to help us find our way. We already knew that these weren't purely friendly 'out of the goodness of their heart' offers of help, that a 'tip' would be expected. The first time a teenage boy spent about 5 minutes helping us find a restaurant. We gave them 50 dirhams (about the equivalent of 6 US dollars) which I thought was quite generous, and he demanded more. Not just simple demanded more, but insisted on it all the way into the restaurant. If this was a one-off kind of experience, I would have just written it off, but it wasn't. The three times we were offered directional help and took it, we gave them anywhere from 5-10 dollars for their trouble and each time were obnoxiously pressured to give more.* when in the main square we stopped to listen to some music being played. My husband, I and our daughter found it interesting. As would be expected any where in the world, some men came with plates for donations. We had been there only a couple minutes and were planning to spend some time walking around, so I gave 50 dirham. They were obnoxious on insisting on more, so I gave them 20 more (total of about 8-9 dollars). That did not placate them. The insistence became so exhausting, we left. Unfortunately, every where we stopped on the square was the same experience. It completely marred the experience of the square for us and we left disappointed. We were more than wiling to contribute monetarily to entertainers, even generously, but when the monetary transaction becomes the main experience, I'd rather not experience it. We never went back to the square.These experiences repeated themselves over and over in Marrakech and it colored the entire experience.THis is not to say there weren't highlights. Several shop owners were delightful and were fun to talk to and bargain with. Our riad was absolutely wonderful and the tour the riad owner gave us as part of our stay was very interesting and fun. Some of the sights were fascinating."

I expected it to be slightly run down and not the cleanest place on earth...but I hoped it would be an interesting experience and nice to walk around...boy was I mistaken!!!! Firstly the souk was the BIGGEST RIP-OFF tourst trap you could ever dream of entering. You get non-stop hassle and you can't look at anything without being pounced upon. They charge disgraceful amounts for things you can find a fraction of the price in the UK, and if you dare look at something and not buy it in these barbarian's shops they will literally call you stupid, tell you that your ''husband needs viagra'' and hurl abuse at you. In addition to being pounced upon you have to try and avoid getting run over by bikes constantely as they are racing up and down the narrow roads (which should and look like they should be pedestrianised). The streets are filthy and smell awful. And as for the food stalls, the people operating them look like they have not had a bath in weeks and there are flies crawling all over the food they sell, and they pick it up with their unclean hands. We would not eat anything from the roadside and even finding cafe's or restaurants that looked clean was like searching for a needle in a haystack. NOTHING is priced, not even water from the kiosks and they charge you what they feel like wherever you go and you cannot even bring out your wallet to buy anything without a peasant behind you holding out their hand for money.Next to no-one speaks English and the people here are the WORST I have ever encountered in all my travels (and I have been to many places). TRUST NO ONE. They are all scroungers and out to get your money....even something as innocent as asking someone the way when you are lost will cost you. They will offer to show you then ask you to pay them, so refuse any of their so called ''help'' at all costs. They also approach you if you are looking lost to try and show you the way so they can take your money. Despite all these negativities I would say that I am glad I experienced it, but 5 days was way too much and drove us mad. My fiance and I glad we have been there, but we will never go again (and I have never been so happy to return the gloomy UK). Visiting such a place makes you appreciate the ''normal'' Europeon countries and I will say, beautiful countries such as Greece are mis-understood - people avoid going there as they believe it is 'expensive'.....but when you are there things are priced, you get charged the same price as the Greeks, you can walk in peace without getting hassle or called names, there are plenty of clean cafe's and restaurants as the people there have standards and are honest civilized beings. Marrakech charges its TOURISTS as much as Greece and Italy would charge, so it may be a country with a bad economy - but they make up for it by ripping us off everywhere we go and treating tourists like idiots."

The square is much less claustrophobic with many established restaurants and banks with cash point machines (once you insert your card you are offered instructions in English)If you do get lost there will be no limit to the number of helpful people happy to show you the way back to the square but they will expect a \"gift\"If you go to visit any of the tanneries, you will also be expected to provide gifts and you might have to endure a visit to a leather shop where you will be encouraged to part with some money.Haggle hard in the medina but do not get angry, if you cannot agree a price, do not worry, just try your luck in the next shop.The place really comes alive as it starts to get dark with lots of mobile restaurants and orange juice stalls, prices are reasonable with very little variation between stalls, the banter between the mobile restaurants and tourists is very good.Watch the taxi's, they don't like to use their meters and will ask for inflated prices, feel free to haggle the price down, walk away from the square towards the tourist information offices and the taxi prices charged become more competitive.From Marrakech you can take a tour into the desert, usually with an overnight stay, although described as fully inclusive you will have to pay for lunch, drinks and the services of guides at sites of interest, if you are including a trek into the desert on a camel make sure you take a scarf or head cover, the camel treks often start from the agency office in Zagora where the staff will pressure you into buying a head scarf at an inflated price (be forewarned, take your own) All in all, it can be a culture shock but it remains a safe place for tourists."

There are amazing items and deals to be had but I would recommend reading up on bargaining techniques before hitting the shops. One good suggestion I wish I had taken: get a guided tour of the souks (most riads offer this) and just window shop to see what you like, where to buy it, and decide what you want to pay. Other than shopping, be culturally prepared. We were there during Ramadan so westerners were the only ones eating and drinking while the sun was up which means some places were closed or only open after sundown. Also, the roads of the medina are busy and dirty (despite the regular upkeep of business owners) and some sights may shock the unprepared westerner (an incredible number of street cats, many beggars including mothers with children, etc). However there is an energy and a beauty to the medina that is very much worth seeing. Don't worry about hitting all the attractions and just soak it in. Doing some research before going will definitely make your visit more pleasant."

Your senses will be assaulted with sights,sounds, smells, and images to which you are not accustomed;but to fully enjoy the medina you must leave the known and wander in the unknown.The medina is rich in history. Read before you come to fully understand where you are standing. My personal recommendation is that you need more than a day. I spent a total of six days broken up into three and three with a trip to Essauoria in the middle. DJemaa el fan is an experience unto itself and to be truthful where I spent a great deal of time. Go to the Souks it is a shoppers haven but be ready to bargain - it is what is expected. It would be rude not to haggle. Know that there are areas for Babouche, Dates, Olives, Leather, Silver, and the list goes on. Make sure you grab a glass of orange juice from a vendor- nothing like you've ever tasted - delicious ! It is important to go during the day as well as go in the evening. The place comes alive you feel somewhat transported back in time. If you are part of a tour or you have hired a guide, I am sure he will direct you to the best spots. If you are solo - then wander, get lost, there is a way out !I visited during the month of July - a bit toasty but I strongly recommend bringing wicking, linen, or cotton clothes. Leave Polly at home as synthetics will make you feel as though you are wearing an oven. Flip flops are fine at home but for the amount of walking.. you will do much better in a good pair of Keens, walkers, or sneakers; leave the cute shoes at home. Exchange your money at the airport makes sure you know the exchange rates. If you don't like crowds do djemaa in the day- at night you get thousands versus what I perceived to behundreds in daylight. You will see cats,cats,cats every where - it is what it is. You will also be approached by adults children often late at night selling tissues or asking for alms. Follow your instincts. Often I would just buy a meal rather than give money if hunger was the issue. But don't judge or compare- just accept that this is what it is there.Do buy some Babouche your feet will never forget you. Learn some basic Arabic and Berber phrases it goes a long way in getting what you want or need. Make sure you have travel size TP and wipes. There are restrooms to be had but finding them is an adventure unto itself and when you do those items will come in handy. And lastly, have fun and enjoy.You will be forever changed if you allow yourself to experience the Medina of Marrakesh."

When going with children, I believe it is easier and safer if they are in the stroller. Wear comfortable shoes that you don't mind getting wet, some areas inside have puddles from the shopkeepers cleaning, especially in the morning. Parking is difficult if you don't have a driver or come by taxi. If you have a car, you may want to get a driver or take a taxi when you visit. So many amazing shops. You just need to be patient and get through all the junk. If a door is closed, knock and attempt to enter. These are normally the nice surprises. Lunch at Cafe Epices or Kosy Bar."

While most tourists see only a small section of the Medina from the square Jamaa al Fna through the Soukhs to the Qoubba, Medersa Bin Youssef, etc., if you leave the \"beaten track\" you will get into the real medina, a convoluted labyrinthine set of open or half-covered alleys, no street names, corners every 10 meters, shops washing their floors onto the street selling things at Moroccan prices. If you ask the way, you are likely to be doggedly tagged by a presumably well-meaning resident who does not speak English, hardly any French, so that he will most likely not take you to where you want to be. If you realise you are being led around in circles, look for anything which resembles a pharmacy and ask the way there. Cars are too wide for the alleys so in the areas where there are shops and shoppers, you can get lots of two-stroke mopeds creating a pungent stench. In these ares you will also find lots of bicycles.The residential areas are by contrast often eerily quiet and much cleaner.The wider streets allow cars to mix with the pedestrians, bicycles, mopeds, donkey carts and more.If you do not like getting lost in a maze, don't leave the \"beaten track\""

From ordering to paying I was there 10 minutes - now that's what I call fast food! (I had a starter and a tajine). The downsides are widely known - monkeys on leashes, being assaulted by blokes bearing snakes, henna tattooists. I found it more annoying during the day actually. It's interesting to observe from a higher vantage point, but the whiny music grates as much as the England football supporters band blaring out 'come on England' on trumpets every 2 minutes. You do get a sense of the history, but a diluted sense, as though it's somehow not authentic now, just a show for tourists."

            "review": "A personal challenge on many different levels. This is a city that cannot be done in a day and does not revolve solely around the Souk's or the Jemaa el Fna, although fascinating. There is a lot more to see and experience in other areas of the Medina and some places outside. Be prepared for hassle, ignore unwanted attention, be confident and avoid hesitation. Don't be bullied into anything at the end of the day you are on holiday. Food:If venturing to the Jemaa el Fna at night hit the stalls. We would recommend choosing the ones that specialise in one particular food type and are frequented by locals rather than tourists. For example, there is a stall for just lentils and beans, another for slow cooked lamb (referred to as meat) another for sausages etc. etc. We preferred these over the mixed menu stalls and restaurants. Bread is automatically given at all eateries but anything else you need to order. You don't have to buy the water that can sometimes appear on the table without asking (that's if you don't open it). Caf\u00e9 palias el Badia: was a good place to watch the Storks of the Kasbah. However if you order anything but a set menu you'll be treated with disdain. Caf\u00e9 Che Chegrouni: Great views of the Jemaa el Fna, the best salad Mmorrocaine in town and extremely reasonable prices. We returned almost daily at varying times. See timings.Language:We found that although we paid reasonable prices to access the Medina's main attractions information had not been translated into English therefore we would recommend investing in a guide book.Security:A money belt is a good investment. Keep your valuables at your accommodation if secure. We met someone who had their passport pick pocketed whilst out in the Souk's around the time school's finished for the day. Timings:Early morning is a great time to wander the streets whilst people are setting up for the day and hassling is at a minimum. Lunchtime (1-2pm) is more subdued again. We found that waiters were more relaxed outside peak times. Friday's are quieter whereas Saturday's are manic, in fact the the weekend is manic full stop. Watch out for school closing times when you can suddenly find yourself in a sea of tiny people. Money:Don't be surprised if cash machines have run out of money on Monday morning in and around the Jemaa el Fna. There is a tendency for people to flit from Euro's to Dirhams whilst negotiating prices in the same sentence, so keep pace with what currency you are working with. Be aware of:People providing false information with regards to directions, opening times and other random stuff. One man appeared to offer us directions but led us to a taut. Another man went out of his way to tell us that the Jardin Majorelle was closed when it wasn't. We were also told but chose to ignore the advise that we were walking towards a dead end when we obviously weren't. Be aware of bored youths in the streets at night. Don't shake traders hands or accept anything, even \u201cpresents\u201d or business cards unless you're prepared to buy their wares or services. Expect to pay for posed photos with anything ranging from Monkey's to orange sellers to wearing a Jellabah. We would recommend avoiding all, unless that's what you want. Keep your hands to yourself to avoid unwanted and aggressive Henna ladies grabbing your arms and keep pointing to a minimum to avoid attention. Attractions: After a week in Marrakech we would recommend The Palais Bahia:- Very pretty and calmThe Madersa Ben Youssef:- Fascinating place, beware of the faux guide within the complex who demands to see your ticket already shown at the entrance.The Musee de Marrakech: Calm place with an excellent Hammam, easily missed. The Musee de la Photograhie:- knowledgeable staff, great exhibition and amazing terrace for unparalleled view of the Medina and the Mountains. The Jardin Majorelle:- A walk from the Medina through the dull Gueliz, but worth it. Great use of colour and planting. Don't rush through it.The Kasbah:- A great alternative to the Jemaa el FnaMamounia:- Great to see how the other half lives when visiting Marrakech, dress smartly and approach confidently to gain access at main gate. Once in you will be treated as if you were a guest. Places to avoid:Le Comptoir; Possibly the worst food we have ever had....ever. Overpriced and overrated."

The medina of Marrakech really is an assault on all the senses, When you first enter the square you are overwhelmed by the colours, the sounds, and the smells. Then you enter the souks with their stalls and shops and the bikes and scooters all trying to fit into the maze of narrow streets. The best way to enjoy the souks is just to wander, to get lost you will always find a way out if not under your own steam but there will always be someone to help you for a few dirhans of course. Enjoy the banter with the stallholders, try bartering - most of the stallholders join in the game. Those that don't just walk away and don't look back.My only criticism is outside the medina at the general level of rubbish that is left around, it appears that there in not much pride in the city. I know it is a different culture and in a dry dusty climate it is difficult to avoid the dust but would it really be that difficult to at least clear up the litter. That said it should not stop you from going to Marrakech and enjoying it"

Set out in the morning to see a couple of things, take your time, stop for coffee, sit on a cafe roof terrace and watch the herds of tour groups snake past. Once you get past the three day mark and can relax into it Marrakech becomes a very different place and the medina is at the heart of it. Get lost in the souks; someone will always point you back to the square (ask a shopkeeper if you don't want a \"guide\" to lead you). Visit the square both during the day and at night to experience the amazing contrast. Talk to the people living and working in the medina, have some fun, laugh with them, you can really get to know some of the culture if you just take the time."

It is absolutely crazy with all the people doubled up with motorbikes whizzing through the crowds, people pulling carts through with allsorts piled on, everyone shouting, the colours. Its madness. The Moroccans are very friendly people and you will get asked in most places to have Moroccan tea while they dress you up in their traditional Moroccan clothing. If you dont want to do this (as there are only so many times a day you can sit in and drink Moroccan tea) you can politely decline. You can get such a variety of items from the markets but remember, never pay more than half their initial asking price. Also shop around first, you can always go back (if you find the place). If you seem interested in an object but are walking about their shop, they will more often than not keep lowering the price - great way to bargain them down :)Be wary of those asking you to buy Marajuana though. The hotel manager told us that most of the time the police are in on it and if you buy, they soon swoop in on you. SO be warned. They kept pestering my younger brother and friend, following them through the streets but you just have to be very firm.The streets are also quite dirty but I still managed to wear flip flops without getting my feet dirty.Also, be wary of buying fresh fruit. So many times i seen the fruit on the floor of the market and they would just pick it up off the floor and place it back into the fruit basket - YUCK!!!But a great and hectic experiance had by all and I cant wait to return next year!"

The hustle, hubbub, and heat; the hassle from hopeful guides and shopkeepers eager to sell, the dodging of potholes, donkey -pulled carts, horse-drawn carriages, mopeds, bicycles, taxis and fellow pedestrians along the maze of narrow, winding passageways. The crumbling walls, Jemaa el Fna Square, the colorful souks, the mosques, ancient ruins ... The clatter, the clamor. Definitely not relaxing! Then, venture into one of the numerous riads within the medina to encounter the beauty of the interior courtyards and rooftop terraces. (We stayed in two.) The peace and quiet of the riads offered welcome respite from the jostle and tumult outside. In the riads and restaurants, there was the opportunity to sample the delicious mint tea, Moroccan pastries, Moroccan tagine cooking, and other specialties. A number of sites on the internet suggest that travel in Morocco is cheap. We did not find this to be the case. In the riads of the Medina, we were paying as much or more for lodging and food as we do in the United States and in Europe. (We were also surprised to find that most of the riads and restaurants were owned and managed by Europeans, while service personnel were invariably native Moroccans.) Photos and narrative don't adequately prepare a visitor for the reality of this ancient Muslim city. Was it a worthwhile experience? Definitely! However, for us, three days would have been enough."

Don't and you'll be fine. I really felt safe in marrakesh. When buying things in the Medina watch out for pick pockets of course and try haggling. It can be quite fun. Keep in mind that you shouldn''t pay more than 50 or 60 dirhams for shoes or 100dirhams for a bag. Things are cheap don't believe them when they start going on about asda price and primark. They are proud people so if you upset them they will tell you directly to get out their shop. And most of the shop keepers speak french and bits of spanish and english. Theyre alll so friendly. But it's really handy to use french if you know it or can get a few places and or a map so you can point out where your going. We were in Morocco for 3 nights. From Marrakesh we went to Rabat and then Casablanca and had a returning flight from there. Explore using the train it's safe and reliable. There are over night trains (we didn't take them) which you can go to other places and safe money on nights. You can check time tables and prices here to plan your trip but you have to get tickets at the station:http://www.oncf.ma/index_en.aspx I was happy with my days. I saw everything I wanted to see. If your with young children I wouldn't recommend such a quick trip. Good luck! :-)"

            "review": "A full 4 days of stress. My partner very nicely decided to take me on a nice romantic weeks holiday.He was thinking of Rome,I however had always always wanted to visit Marrakech so I managed to persuade him.After four long weeks of searching and reading review after review I was full of excitement to set off on what I imagined would be a magical,romantic adventure for our first holiday together.How very very wrong I was.I had decided that if we were doing Marrakech then I'd want to see the real Marrakech.The idea of a riad in the medina was where I wanted us to be.Our arrival was a bit scary but I tried not to let the filthy streets and chaos put me off.The owner of our Riad seemed very nice and showed us the general direction of Djemaa el Fna which turned out to be about a ten min walk away.It was all very exciting ...for about an hour We were out for 3 hours ,three hours of my life I'd Never want to get backi had been prior warned by my sister who had visited a year before for a day about the hassle tourists get.She'd already warned me about the typicle tourist traps so I felt somewhat prepared not confident but prepared.I managed to dodge quite a few burka clad ladies offering henna tattoos and felt accomplished that I'd made it out unscathed however we decided to eat at one of the stalls in the la place and thats where the nightmare starts.Kids begging hords of them ,not one or two but ten....or more.The worst thing I could've done looking back on things is even just talk to them.So to cut a long storey short.....The kids are there to set you up to get fleeced ,a shame yes but sadly thats how it was.one small boy did off with 200 dirhams . I now know you never ever give anyone a large note for anything....he was selling me a leather camel ,so as im trying to get my money back whilst eating food I turn around and there's a lady who has tattooed half of my arm.We get into a bit of a conflab she DEMANDS 800 dirhams from me ....for the tattoo I never wanted and when I've had more than i can take I give her 50 and decide its time to leave........15 mins later this woman is still following and pestering me for more before leaving with her 50 dirhamSo we're back in the souk trying to find our way back after a shakey start to our holiday.I'm a bit unsettled by my double rip off but trying to keep up good spirits and when we come to a bit of a crossroads in the path back to our riad and are undecided which path to take some much appreciated friendly local lads come to give us some directions.After about 20 mins of walking down and around the most dismal alleys (one of which had a local man beating up his wife) i get the impression we're being taken on a bit of a dodgy tour of the medina and also a lend of.By this time I am very upset my partner is feeling very responsible and quite intimidated.30-40 mins later we find our riad.The very friendly local lads very quickly turn very nasty and DEMAND! 300 dirhams =the thick end of \u00a330 for there services .We don't have the 300 to give them and offer them what we have ...they decline ,we go into our riad ,they bang and ring on the door shouting all the time for half an hour ............................................ 3 hours in Marrakech,to be honest,it realy did'nt get any better.We left on day 3 to go to Essaouira which was heaven in comparison. The sadest day was when we knew we had to leave and spend the last two nights back in the madness of MarrakechI know that my experience may be an unfortunate one ,maybe I had the worst luck.I have since read lots and lots of amazing reviews of Marrakech and I realy realy wish mine had been as lovely as others have found it but for me.........it realy was just DISMAL"

            "review": "Amazing!. I have always wanted to visit Marrakech and of course Djamaa el Fna so this was my 40th birthday present from my husband.I was not disappointed! I admit I did get a little fed up of the constant hassle from stall holders and kept getting comments like \"hey you are Gavin and Stacey\" (yes we are Welsh!!) which I found very amusing! I did get a little freaked by one guy as myself and my husband wandered down a few alleys (getting lost is all part of it and is fun!) and felt a little out of my comfort zone as he was trying to lead us to the tanneries (where I had no interest in going) and said he was taking us there for free and I needed to chill out (as I was getting a bit hacked off with him). My husband was cross with me for being rude to him but I did just get a bit nervous but I apologised to him and we went on our way with no problem.My advice is to completely relax as the people are lovely. We bought some scarves from one stall and the guy was the nicest, friendliest and funniest chap we had met, and we were not ripped off at all and haggling was really good fun (and he gave me a free keyring!!).All in all, the best experience ever and we can't wait to return - maybe for my 50th?!"

            "review": "Getting lost and hassled are part of the fun!. The medina is the ancient, walled, inner city of Marrakech. I've explored it on 2 different occasions over the past couple of years, and nothing has changed. It's composed of narrow, dark, winding alleyways and high, rose coloured, crumbling walls...Hoards of people, scooters, fluters, monkeys, donkeys, horses, hawkers, mockers, bicycles, shady characters, story tellers, potion sellers, snake charmers (who aren't very charming at all), stray cats, funny hats, henna ladies, suspect food stalls, bargains, jargons...and is the pulsing heart and soul of this 11th century city.Almost all the alleyways and trinket stalls look the same so it's very easy to get lost...sort of...Because in reality, you're not lost at all...You're in the medina! The \"jewel\" of this place is the wide-open Jemaa el Fna, which becomes a vast, smokey, open-air food market by night, surrounded by terraced cafes and restaurants, with the ever-present Koutoubia Mosque looming over the western edge.Behind almost every seemingly non-desript arched, wooden door is a small, luxurious palace called a \"riad\", but you'd never know it from the outside! Be prepared to be approached by faux guides and vendors trying to sell you everything from apples to zebra skins. You need to have your wits about you and enjoy a good adventure in order to enjoy this place. It's not for those looking for a relaxed, sheltered atmosphere.The intricate, gigantic archways display ancient Moorish architecture and mosaics, and you never quite know what may happen next! If you've ever been wanting to visit a place that Indiana Jones himself may have enjoyed searching for lost treasures in, then you need to go here to see for yourself."

Morocco holds much more in terms of its cultural diversity then in monumental or architectural heritage. The pinacle of Moorish Art and Architecture is in Spain. Though there are definately some things to visit in Marrakech, namely: 1) Saadian Tombs, Baadi Palace, Bin Youssef Medressa and for muslims (as non-muslims not allowed in the following) Koutoubia Mosque, Kasbah Mosque, Qessain Mosque.What I love is to wander through the streets of the Medina away from the Souqs amidst the Donkey ridden streets, sample some sugar cane juice, and try to navigate narrow streets. At night you can wander endlessly around the square of Djamma Al Fanaa (Place of Transient Gathering) which offers some street performing entertainment but more importantly lots of people watching and delicious meals. I would particularly recomend Lamb Brain, Lamb head, and Moroccon snails for those that want to prove and test their culinary metal."

Jama Al-Fna is a magical place and the culture jazz will take you to an awe inspiring new dimension which will stay with you for the rest of your life. Start off with a horse carriage to the square which will set you in the right frame of mind as to what is to come : Acrobats, monkeys, snakes, musicians, lizards, tortoises , dancing, prancing ,horses and spices , haggling and buying which will captivate you and the children. The juice stalls and food stalls, the balcony restaurants, the hustle and bustle of traders and customers, the drumming, the smoke , the scents and smells. Things to see , things to buy , some expensive , some cheap but make sure you control your money as you can easily get carried away. No trip to Morocco is complete without a visit to this magical \"square\". Take a trip to the adjacent souks and haggle to your hearts content and remember they have two prices one for locals and one for tourists which are ten times higher. Some warnings, don't have black hena applied to your body as some are contaminated and can affect your health. Also if you take photos they expect money and its best to negotiate a price before rather than afterwards. The natives are very friendly people but remember tourism is their livelihood and some of them can get a bit greedy. The police are extremely friendly. Visit it during the day and night as its character changes completely at night."

Trying to get a taxi driver to take you to where you want to go almost impossible. Always agree a price first and be prepared to haggle over it. They almost always insist on taking you to the \"Pharmacy\" first - although having said that it was interesting! Taxi driver waited outside for us and then insisted on taking us to a \"general market\" - not the Medina. We gave up in the end and paid him but he followed us insisting on us going inside - we just had to ignore him and he eventually gave up. Sweet boy appeared and said he would take us to the Medina - we gave in a followed him and he took us back to the \"Pharmacy\"!! Gave up and asked a woman who told us the right way without asking for payment. The souks are amazing but be prepared to be continually hassled. What they don't tell you is that you can't spend Dirhams in the Duty Free Shops at the airport - I had some left! Even the ordinary shops there give you Euros in change for Dirhams so be warned and don't bother to save any for last minute shopping. By law you can only take 1000 Dirhams out of the country and you can't exchange them back in UK . 5 out of 12 of us spent two days hugging the loo and another friend recently suffered the same fate - thank goodness for Imodium!! Exciting and fun trip nevertheless."

We really enjoyed the trip, just be aware if you look lost the people may take advantage of you and try and persuade you to follow them to a shop etc. The lastest trick is to tell you the musuem or the palace is closed , when in fact they are open. Opening times for all attractions are 9 till 12 and 2.45 till 5.30. We found if we planned where to go and how to get there nobody bothered us at all. do try eating in the square at night time, best of the traders was number one stand, ask for potatoe cakes and aubergine, great stuff."

The medina was an interesting and colourful experience where you could easily and happily get lost taking in the sights. But I am afraid as the sights are really all you want to take in. The locals are used to lots of tourists and you will pay quite a high price for the goods on offer (when they offer ASDA price as to show cheap you know its England prices). I was honestly shocked at the few places I tried to barter in the Medina that they were giving prices 2 to 3 times what you would pay in the U.K and you could at best barter to 90% of what you would pay here. My advice would be to browse in the Medina and then go to the shops nearer the tombs in Marrakech and buy what you want there at a heavily reduced price.  Also realise that whilst an amazing sight and sound the Medina is now not a true reflection of Medina's (markets) thorughout africa"

Its best to start at a fixed point in the medina such as one of the main gates and head to one of the main sites such as the kotoubia for example so that you can ask people along the way for directions while also exploring the medina. When I went to marrakech, we didnt plan to explore the medina like this, but it just so happened that we never found the site we wanted to go to in one go and ended up having to walk through the tiny streets in the medina asking for directions along the way. It was great though! Just be prepared to walk long distances in the heat and it'll be OK!"
