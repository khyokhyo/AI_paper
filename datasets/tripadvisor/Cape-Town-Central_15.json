The V&A Waterfront is a reclaimed piece of waterfront with beautiful views of Table Mountain and the waterfront right out to Robben Island. It consists of a lot of touristy shops, malls, restaurants and hotels. However, we found the craft market building to be a hidden gem with many quality, local crafts that were suitably priced. We also enjoyed the food market next door, with its many booths of tasty, local delicacies. Coming soon is a new museum of African Art which will be housed in a beautiful restored building. Another reason to visit!"

Then out to the mall, and then one is truly gobsmacked, as there are two floors and every shop possible from exclusive boutique lingerie through to Cape Union where one can buy great clothes, camping gear, etc. plus two cinemas....plus several great restaurants....plus plus plus....and then outside, more lovely restaurants, a small stage where budding and well-known musicians perform regularly....and it does not end there. If you are not tempted by any of the food on offer there, walk down to the fish and chip shop and get a great meal, wrapped in paper, and sit and enjoy whilst looking out on the great view, and finally....take a trip on a boat round the harbour which is especially lovely at dusk, with a glass of sauvignon blanc or an ice cold beer to hand....all in all a treat!"

Not much advantage in sitting in \"lover's lane\" as opposed to the open areas of the restaurant as we are all pretty much in the same area. The shopping at the Waterfront is expensive so I did not end up buying anything here, but, it is a nice place to walk around for a few hours and enjoy a meal at either the food court or an upscale restaurant."

Dont let bad weather deter you from spending some time here, the IMAX cinemas, museums and the inevitable shopping experiences are ideal for days where the sun doesn't shine!"

If like us, you were in Cape Town for over 2 weeks, then it make sense to go just to say you did, but if you've only got a few days, there are far more interesting places to visit.The shopping mall, is... well a shopping mall. Nothing exciting, slightly confusing to navigate through if anything.Outside by the waterfront is nice, lots of restaurants to suit all needs which all all look appetising, but they are overpriced for SA. Still, about a third of the price compared to the UK so I can't say that bothers me. Same as the \"traditional African shops\", these are super aimed at tourists and overpriced for questionably handmade items. If you want some genuine, handmade African items, go to people with stalls selling on the side of the roads, or Green Market Square. Far more interesting items too in my opinion.Parking is easy under the mall, which is always a bonus. So yeah, if you've only got a few days, give it miss, but if you're not pushed for time, worth a walk around and a nice lunch."

It is pleasant just to stroll here searching for this perfect place to eat, browse through numerous stores or visit the mall. We like stopping in Market on the Wharf which is such a fun place for foodies. We also like Den Anker Belgian restaurant where ten years ago we had our first impala.The area has a draw bridge and you can watch the sail boats arrive or depart. The tours of Robben Island depart from V&A Waterfront. We enjoyed our sunset cruise with champagne one evening which allowed us to appreciate the beauty of the Waterfront also from the harbor and ocean side. One of the areas near the Nobel Square almost always features talented South African performers made so popular by Paul Simon a number of years ago.There are some really good souvenir stores with pretty costume jewelry and mementos of your trip. \"Two Ocean Aquarium\" is open all year and is a good option for a rainy day.V&A Waterfront is actually a walking distance (well, somewhat longer walking distance..) to many center city hotels and Convention Center."

Even going so much for the special priced boat rides at times just R40.00 for half an hour to an hour. Prices are pretty reasonable and the atmosphere is awesome! There is an abundance of restaurants to tickle your tastebuds. Various art and craft shops for the arty and creative persons or just chill walking along the waters edge on the boardwalk is an exhilarating experience. You cannot get any better. Take a ride on the wheel and get to see the beautiful sunset views and city views, which Cape Town has to offer. Do not miss this opportunity. <3<3"

You can even see Robben Island and Table Mountain looks as if you can touch the rocks as the wheel goes round.A bit daunting at first, but we soon got used to seeing the ground beneath our feet, as the wheel stops midway up - you get a chance to take photos and look around intensely. the entire ride is about 15 minutes, and gives you enough time to really enjoy this experience!

The layout is fab with high street stores on the ground level (such as h&m) and pricey outfits on the top (gucci, boss) making it all the easier to navigate. There is a food hall area which leads outside to more restaurants overlooking the harbour. There is a clock tower by the Nelson Mandela gate museum where you can watch (and smell!) the fur seals swim and nap. The outside area has a playarea and fountains to splash in, and near here local musicians play on the street side and on the stage/amphitheatre. There is also a separate building full of boutique shops, again proving how well thought out the area is. There is another building which houses and incredible food hall with the most delicious food stalls ranging from chocolate to zebra to samosas and everything in between! Further back there is another warehouse called the watershed in which there are a plethora of independent stalls. My favourites were beautiful sunset candle makers and an outlet which sold beautiful decorations made by women who needed to support their families as part of a township programme. Behind this is the amazing two oceans aquarium which is also well worth a visit - it's safe to say there is something for everyone here!"

Lots of interesting sculptures and artworks scattered all around.I also visited the Two Oceans Aquarium, which was great. Lots of marine life which most of us would never see close up (fish, penguins, invertebrates, seaweeds including giant kelp). Good place for adults to visit, but obviously hugely interesting for children too. That was very good value for money too.Wandering around the greater waterfront area is all free - but obviously you pay to go into the Aquarium, pay to go out to Robben Island, pay for anything you want from the shops or cafes . . ."

Sadly the views of Table Mountain were obstructed by fog but the waterfront is a very safe, relaxed place to hang out, with a great range of food and shopping establishments, and adequate bathrooms everywhere. For anyone contemplating staying at a nearby hotel, they are all pretty upscale but once you leave the property you will be surrounded by crowds virtually everywhere you go. Lots of boat rides and sales agents trying to get you to buy-in to their offerings. But the vibe here is pretty exciting so I would definitely plan to return here in the future."

August in the Cape can experience cold weather, and it certainly did on our visit.It was raining & cold so we headed to the V&A for indoor/warm activities. Although we both really enjoyed the restaurants, aquarium, craft shops & food courts, the waterfront itself was not that attractive. Some of it was hidden by building works but i think you would be disappointed if you went there to take some lovely photos of an old harbour.Having said that, it is a lively area, with plenty to see & do, so I recommend the attractions the area (Museums, aquarium, shopping, restaurants & cafes) but not the waterfront itself."

How cool! The guitar's neck, headstock and pick-up system were not the cheap quality that you typically see when travelling. Most musical instruments you purchase while travelling wind up hanging on your living room wall. These guitars were actually very well-crafted electric guitars that you could actually play live. If you're a guitar player, make time to visit and purchase one of these guitars. With two weeks still left in my vacation, I'm not sure how I would have gotten the guitar home in one piece, but I'm certainly regretting not purchasing one in Cape Town. Also enjoyed the young lady playing guitar on the steps of inside of the mall. Tough gig!"

The Food court is of a quality rarely seen in such places and the pubs and bars are interesting. There is usually some entertainment going on and the Waterside is mercifully free of beggars. It attracts tourists but also Cape Town residents. We visited in August and I reckon it will have an even greater buzz in summer."

The children are given activity packs in which there is a list of things to spot, it helps on the hour and twenty min journey to the waterfront where we got off . The sun was shining, even though we are local this is the 2nd time on the bus and I have nothing but the highest praise for it"

Always a wonderful vibe, lots of lovely restaurants to choose from, shopping, and of course, entertainment. From the Big Wheel, where you can get a bird's eye view over Cape Town, to the local artists performing and entertaining the crowds, there is always something to see and do.If you want a really great experience, take a trip out on one of the many yachts available for a trip around the bay, from where you have a wonderful view of Table Mountain and Robben Island. You also might be lucky enough to see a whale in the bay. The Jolly Rodger is a Pirate Ship, that is very entertaining, especially for the children. The \"pirates\" on board put up a great entertaining show.You really should not miss coming to the Waterfront when you visit Cape Town!"

Set down at the harbour there is live music and two shopping centres with lots of different shops.Its just a brilliant place to eat, drink, shop or just even hang out. Very safe also-Loved it!"

However, please please please don't buy your souvenirs from the shops there as they are HIGHLY overpriced. I almost bought something that would have cost me the equivalent of $35USD and another tourist stopped me and suggested that I try elsewhere. Traffic around the waterfront can be very hectic so if you're taking an uber (which I HIGHLY suggest - very affordable), please meet your uber in front the front of a local hotel. The shops are nice, the fast food like KFC was great and fresh. Oh yeah, the seagulls... those creatures are scary and disrespectful to we poor humans, lol. If you're going to have lunch at an outdoor restaurant, you will have to contend with birds nearly attacking you for your food. They will viciously swoop down and steal your food. If you think I'm fibbing, ask the waiters. Other than that, its just so lovely you can't help but making a trip or two or three while you're in cape town. One more thing, ride the ferris wheel. Its a touristy thing to do and its just fun!! Go for it and have a blast! Enjoy."

It is a great place to visit during the day, but not recommended for night time. Prices at the shops seem pretty reasonable and many of them will bargain. You leave for Robben Island from the waterfront as well as any other water excursions. We had several good meals there and enjoyed the street performers which are dotted around the area. The Ferris wheel gives a great view of the area. Cape Town has a very high crime rate, and while you are probably safe during the day, and even at night in the area, you still have to make your way back to your hotel and the hotel staff will warn you that really isn't safe."

Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, fondly known as V & A, is such a destination. There is a multitude of cafes and restaurants, including a Spur steakhouse, and MacDonalds.There's Ocean Basket for seafood and good old-fashioned fish and chips, with Quay Four for a pricier but more varied option for delicious seafood, a charming view and a pub feel with live music. Belthazar for steaks, seafood and South African wine with a seafront terrace is a more elegant, higher end option for a diner, while Mugg and Bean is immensely popular for their breakfasts, comfort food, delectable cakes and oversized burgers and portions.But V and A is not just about food. it is essentially a family place with a movie complex, amphitheatre and outside seating for more casual visitors. Seasonal free music shows remain a huge attraction. This destination also extends to a romantic getaway of boat rides, a show and an intimate dinner."

I liked staying right in the heart at the Victoria & Albert Hotel and particularly enjoyed the Watershed, home to smaller vendors of crafts, clothes, jewellery and housewares."

When visiting Cape Town there are a few things one has to simply do, going up Table Mountain certainly being one, having sundowners at one of the many roadside venues in Campsbay being another, but an absolute \"must visit\" is most certainly the V&A Waterfront.Lots to see and do for big and small, be it sightseeing, eating, having a drink, going for a boat trip around the harbour, shopping or just people watching.Well worth at least half a day in your travel agenda and that is if you don't also visit the world-class aquarium or take a trip across to Robben Island, as that requires spending a whole day in and around the Water Front and believe you me, it's well worth it."

There were also 'speed boat' tours available that should provide an adrenalin rush.The 'Big Wheel' was constantly busy, and I am sure there would be a decent view from the top of the wheel.We parked in the under cover garage opposite the waterfront and it cost R10 for two hours.Always worth a visit when in Cape Town and a must for foreign visitors."

The waterfront, is a bulevard like mall, with a lot of restaurants, pubs and shopping places.

The first thing that struck me were two huge ships that were being painted in a dry dock and opposite to it was a office block and across as square was the restaurant \"capetown fish market. The jumble was delectable. You could go around quays and dock fronts with touristy umbrellas housing various waterborne tour companies promising to take you out into the harbour for every conceivable reason. On one end there was a food market selling gourmet food items and a market selling handicrafts and other collectables. It has a capeunion mart store bang in the middle and restaurants circling the area. Simply a place to spend your day in a jolly mood."

Seek out the \"Walk\" that you can take through the V&A properties, it is well marked and you get to see all the harbour has to offer. The museums/Art gallery also on the Clocktower side are brand new and very interesting especially the History of Golf Museum above CTFM It really is much more than just a shopping centre. For those who want a good value meal stop in at Tribakery next to the Robbin Island Ferry Terminal, they also serve a fantastic strong local craft beer available nowhere else called Jwarha, try it. The only slight negative is the Robbin Island Ferry, it is not well run and the tour and the island are great but the ferry is not reliable and we were let down twice."

Find yourself surrounded by people speaking many different languages on any day of the week while you shop to your hearts content at the various stores and boutiques. The V&A offers mainly upmarket clothing boutiques with about three affordable stores for the average person. There are African curio shops, a winery and other different stores as well. The restaurants offer a wide range of cuisines to suit your palate and pocket. If you want something quick to eat there are fast food restaurants. It's a viby place to hang out at and in summer it's a must to visit. Buy a delicious ice-cream cone at Gelato Mania and take a walk around and admire the bay or just sit on one of the benches and get a tan. The boat trips are a great way to spend a summer afternoon, with a few going to Robben Island as well. It's an awesome place to while away a night. The bars are packed and music playing attracts many bar hoppers. But it's also a nice place for families to enjoy, with a jungle gym outside and the Scratch Patch to explore.  Avoid the V&A like the plague on New Year's Eve!!! I went there once on that evening and never will I again.If you like being jostled by hordes of sweaty and maybe( highly likely) drunk Capetonians and tourists go ahead and jump in there and go crazy. It will take a while for your hearing and sanity to return to normal once you've stumbled your way back to your hotel room. If you can find it if you were among the tipsy ;)."

It's very secure, contains some excellent hotels and many dozens of excellent restaurants covering the whole gammet of differing cuisines. It is a stunning and vibrant place with a huge array of shops, cafes, pubs, restaurants, cinema, aquarium etc etc. The Waterfront is a must see on anyone's first visit to Cape Town. Be advised that the prices are geared more for the visiting tourist than the savvy locals. This being said though, it is the ideal place for tourists to walk around with families doing the inevitable holiday shopping without having to worry about security, the car and being hassled as is often the case in the centre of Cape Town. The fact that it's a working port adds reality to the port locale and makes for an exciting day/night out."

Tons of restaurants and shops, luxury hotels, plenty of things to do and see and eat and drink. You can definitely spend a couple of days here, especially if you like to shop. The mall itself is pretty impressive, easy to get lost in, and all the outdoor restaurants just add to the environment. Plenty of bars for nightlife as well. Not sure what the hell you are doing in Cape Town if you don't hit this area."

There is a good array of local African shops as well as typical luxury brands. Great restaurants and good, clean, safe setting. We came back a few times for shopping and the little market across the street (highly recommend) and to pick up a few items. I even got my haircut here. Don't cross it off your list just because it is a mall. It is worth the time to visit, and is a good spot to come after some of the other sites are closed, especially at night."

It is a key element of modern Cape Town, with a real buzz about the place. The shopping mall is extensive, housing every high tag designer outlet. It is well designed, offering a safe environment with friendly and helpful security officers around for when you get lost!The waterfront offers a wide range of points of interest, ranging from a Comedy Club to modern art statues, a large workspace for artisan crafts and a host of replica and historic marine memorabilia. There are also rugby and diamond museums to name a couple of other places of interest.Around the waterfront itself there is a plethora of restaurants, catering for every taste and most pockets. The waterside avenues are pleasant enough with lots of features, statues and walkways to interest the tourist. Routes are easily accessible for those who would otherwise struggle over the steps and cobbles that sometimes characterise such areas. A main pick up point and ticket office for the Ho Ho buses is also located here. (near the aquarium)There are activities for the kids...of any age... but we did not find anywhere too overcrowded...maybe over the New Year period it would be as there is so much going on. I have written reviews elsewhere on the restaurants we frequented; suffice to say we were very happy to eat there - in fact we were spoilt for choice."

There is also a mall with a movie theater conveniently located right there.While we were visiting there was also a great market with local goods, however it seemed temporary so it may only be there for the weekends. This was where I got the majority of souvenirs I brought back home, so I would highly recommend checking it out if you can. The variety of goods and wares is pretty impressive.If you are looking to visit Robben Island, this is also the jumping off point for that--the ferry docks here.

It felt very similar to other, similar waterfront redevelopment projects in other parts of the western world. I wouldn't discourage anybody from going there, but I would definitely prioritize themany things that are unique and special about Cape Town when planning a trip. The V&A Waterfront doesn't have as much unique local character."

Remains of huge success, with a winning combination of shopping, attractions (such as aquarium and big wheel), views of Table Mountain and many restaurants. It is also interesting as it is still a commercial harbour with ship movements and a ship repair yard (hours of interest for a bloke to watch- how do they get such big ships out of the water?). Make sure that you visit the seals that are near the clock tower, which is also the departure point for the Robbin's Island tours.More a general comment but be careful of people approach you at cash machines, our colleague got scammed when a cash machine near the Waterfront didn't work and a very 'helpful' passer by tried to assist with the transaction."

The location is self-sufficient with hotels, restaurants, bars and shopping area etc catering to visitors. It is crowded most of the time in the day, virtually every day during our entire stay. Visitors are mixed with both locals and tourists. Entertainment and eateries aside, it is most important that the area is extremely safe and security guards were visible in most places. One caveat though is that the area is not inexpensive and almost everything situated there is of high-end. There a beach within walking distance toward the sea-front where one can BBQ and enjoy basking in the sun."

Then proceeded to walk towards some live music playing from an open restaurant. The locals seemed to know each song being played . I enjoyed watching the children dancing in the water fountain.

In the nicer weather, visitors enjoy the outdoor cafe vibe, while enjoying views of recreational and fishing boats entering and leaving the old harbour. Recreational activities are also on offer, especially in the summer season, such as watching shows at an outdoor ampitheatre, taking a boat trip around the harbour or out into Table Bay, watching local performers busking in the open areas, seal watching, etc. However, there are also indoor activities on offer such as Cave Golf, an Aquarium, a Scratch Patch (for picking up chips of semi-precious stones), Cinemas, etc, so this is a popular venue for any time of the year.

Open Air Amphitheatre, Kiddies activities, Food courts, Aquarium, Walking distance from the Cape Town Stadium (5mins brisk walk or 10mins slow paced).

There is a 'Husband Day Care Centre' at the Quay 4 Restaurant for those wanting to go off for some retail therapy (keep in mind...take his credit card). The Eye is located at the V & A Waterfront.Entrance to the actual waterfront is free but parking fee applicable.

Around about cars had arranged to collect us at the cruise terminal and take us to the office for Tempest to collect the car. However we phoned Around about cars and arranged for Tempest to deliver the car to the cruise terminal (for an extra fee - 275 rand) - worth every penny when u see the cape town traffic and not really knowing your way around. There are other options -Get it delivered - more expensive but most convenient and less stressful.Use Around about cars and be collected and taken of car hire - still to face cape town traffic and takes longer.There are lots of taxis at the cruise terminal at Duncan dock and it is not too far to any of the car hire offices, so fare would not be too expensive but u still have to face cape,town traffic. If u are heading north on n22 then it is relatively straightforward from cruise terminal but a bit more complicated from central cape town especially if u have not driven in the city before. Cosf was approximately \u00a380 for 5 days plus fuel plus delivery charge.

It doesn't feel super authentic, but it's definitely worth visiting, especially for dining and shopping. We ate at the mall on our first night in town at Willoughby & Co. It was highly rated and when we realized it was actually in the mall, it felt a little odd. (The meal was good though!) The V&A Waterfront is not lacking in shopping, but our favorite place at the Waterfront was The WaterShed, which was a huge building turned into a market, selling art from local vendors. We picked up a lot of nice art and souvenirs there. I do recommend visiting the Waterfront for a walk on the boardwalk or a nice dinner, but I am glad we didn't end up staying here. While it's a hub for activity and a great central location, it seems like it would have been noisy for sleeping."

The food market have a variety of eats and the local market offer handmade RSA goods for the discerning traveller. The restaurants are quite expensive and you must consult the menus before sitting down for dinner because some of the menus are limited. Overall a great place to see the sunset over Table Mountain."

Take a pic with the Big 4 and meander your way along. The mall itself offers flagship shops and myriad of boutiques. If you are here to shop - rather hop to Canal Walk for a larger selection."

Don't miss the the area where Woodies burgers is; I can't remember the name. In that building there is even more great food as well as an amazing waffle I had at For the Love of Yummyness (as soon in the picture). Woodies is apparently the best burger in Capetown as there was a long line, however I went to a place called Gibson's and ordered some pork ribs. Sooo good! There are street performers here as well, which makes the V&A Waterfront a good place for families to visit together."

We used the shuttle each day of our stay, to go for dinners and to get to the starting point of the Robben island tour. The waterfront area is huge and it's a \"happening\" place -- lots of shops & restaurants, entertainment. Also has an interesting \"swing\" bridge (the bridge literally swings out of the way when tall boats need to pass through the area -- much faster than a lift-bridge) There are almost 100 restaurants, of every variety, to choose from. The \"Cape Wheel\" is a great place to get a view of the surrounding area -- similar to the London Eye and the ferris wheel at Chicago's Navy Pier."

The waterfront comes alive in the night as the impromptu African band members dance and play their songs for tourists, the Giant wheel takes you up for an incredible view of the city, the pubs dish out martinis an the fine dining restaurants offer delicious fresh sea-food, while the French cafes offer baguettes, crepes and yummy desserts! The Waterfront Hotel is a beautiful structure. The Aquarium is at a walking distance. The Hop on and off bus station is opposite the aquarium. The waterfront is a huge area and you can spend endless hours just chilling here sipping on some great South African wine.

Lots of great historic sites and information, exhibitions really educational.good programme of busking performers during day and evenings who don't hassle but deserve a good tip, they are all talented and working hard. It's a bit of a walk from some city locations and a free shuttle service would enhance the ease to get there, but there's a good bus service and taxi ranks. Very clean toilets in shopping centre, great harbour and quayside views, fantastic public art exhibitions and sculptures on site add to the atmosphere and photographic setting...a must visit location"

She appreciated watching a microscopic view on screen of a barnacle and how it feeds and grows its shell around it. I had not realized that barnacles are alive before. Penguins are fed at 11.45 am every day and information is given about them and their steady decline around the world while this is done. Enormous sharks and sting rays circle with countless other species of fish in a large tank in a room with seating where parents can sit and watch too. There are also supervised play rooms where smaller children can draw or paint or play in sandpits.We return every school holiday and have learnt so much as well as having fun.

Lots of restaurants and even a food court (with individual kiosks that sells thai food, yogurts, pizza etc). For such a busy and well visited mall, I was disappointed that the floor plan given out by the mall was outdated. We went in search of some restaurant that was already closed. Hence, hope that the management of V&A mall would take some effort to print updated floor plans to be given to visitors or to install digital kiosks that provide updated information of tenants in the mall. The whole area of V&A waterfront was really big and we only managed to cover maybe 1/3. Parking was tough even though V&A waterfront has many carparks, as the carparks are far from the mall and we had to walk quite far from the carpark to the mall. At the area closed to the departure to Robben Island, there are a few Seals in the enclosure. So if you have the time, do take time to walk around the whole V&A waterfront."

It did remind me of the south street seaport in NY. Not much of an African flare however, a lovely view of table mountain from the 2nd floor restaurant outdoor seating. There is a mall right behind the restaurants but, everything (except the food and drinks) is very overpriced. We ate at a couple of the restaurants. The food was good but, average. Better food choices and more authentic if you venture inland. Nice to walk around though but, I would not make it a focal point of a trip to CapeTown and I did not find it an absolute necessity to stay at a hotel there."

Shopping mall has everything you need but if you are self catering and buying to eat in take the car as you will buy more than you can carry. When going into the car park area it looks as if you are pulling into a loading bay, keep going as the parking area is off to the right, we turned around and were going to leave but seen other cars disappear into the parking area and realized our mistake. Market Shed has all the local artists stuff my wife loved this place and we would have bought more but just didn't have the space in our bags as always packed too much we didn't use.

He loves the V&A \"Eye\" giant Wheel, he loves the kiddies section with the outdoor water park, which he runs around in, right next to the kiddies entertainment area. After playing around there, we stroll around so that he can listen to the music, local musicians, then we either take a boat trip, even a helicopter ride (a special birthday treat) and then off to the Oceanarium for further fun and excitement.There are plenty of places to get some food on the go, we head to McDonalds to get him his fries, and then take walks through the shopping centre and then we head out across the road to the little beach on the far side so that he can watch the ocean and the waves. In fact, nothing is planned, we just go wherever he wants to - there is so much to see and do, it is impossible to mention everything here - no visit to Cape Town is complete without spending a day at the V&A Waterfront.

The selection of bars shops and places to eat were good but at the lower price end not exciting and for the price charged the more expensive placed charged to much for the food quality / presentation on offer and the service provided. However as it was our first visit to SA I would not like to be too hard on anything."

Personally, I find it deeply touristy, more than the more agreeable Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, for instance. It has developed it's own ambiance, but has kept very little of the original sense of a great harbor. Maybe I'm too old, but I remember the days when, air travel being rare, you traveled to and from Europe by ship and this was one of the most unforgettable harbours on earth. You'd get up before dawn, and wait on deck for Table Mountain to appear over the horizon, and then slowly glide into the harbour, full of shouts, clanking chains, and the smell of salty oil. That feel of arrival at a genuine working harbour, is gone, and Gucci-fied."

The V&A (Victoria and Alfred) Waterfront is one of Cape Town's biggest attractions, if one is to judge by the crowds of people that come here looking for a place to eat, shop and be entertained. Alive and busy, vibrant and touristy, with lots of things to see and do, it's worth visiting even if you don't plan to eat or shop there. Because you can still enjoy the charming setting of the old harbor, the mishmash of old and new buildings, the views of the Table Mountain as a backdrop. The place is especially lovely at sunset. As for what you can find here, the V&A has it all: upscale hotels, small shops that sell local African art and souvenirs, big brands inside the Victoria Wharf shopping center, cafes and restaurants where you can grab something to eat ranging from fast food to upscale dining, street performers, even a Ferris Wheel. The Two Oceans Aquarium is located here and the boats for Robben Island also leave from the V&A. You can book pretty much any type of cruise that you can think of, from sunset cruise to whale watching, from fishing to shark diving trips. The harbor even has 2 small playgrounds which my kids really enjoyed.For a bit of history, the harbor was created in 1860 under the tutelage of Prince Alfred, Queen Victoria's second son. The first basin was named after himself, the second after his mother, hence the name. It fell into decline by mid 20th century and was revamped in the 1990s. V&A still functions as a harbor today."

There is a little Market selling all sorts of food to eat with seats outside for you to relax ant enjoy your food. The craft market which is like an emporium is good for getting an idea of what is available to buy as you continue your travels. There is a large shopping centre too and a large selectin of restaurants available but we did not visit as it's not our thing, but I I gues fine if it is raining. There are plaques and info boards giving the history of the docks too. You can also book variou boat trips here as well as harbour tours. It was fairly quiet on the Sunday when we arrived at 11ish but it was very busy when we visited again after we had visited Robben Island. So go early if your not keen on crowds. You could spend all day here but I think 3-4hours is enough excluding meal time."

We had lunch and dinner there several times and all were very good. We saw African performers too which added to the fun. I would definitely recommend the V and A Waterfront."

But it's great for a couple of hours with Scratch Patch near by, and the Aquarium round the corner. It's all pretty nearby to stadium and main road. Very picturesque and great weather it helps to make for a near perfect day if hanging around doing nothing else other than shopping the same branded stuffs avail any where else around the world"

I really expected the food market to be something special considering the great wines and produce of the region, what a let down.

The ferry for Robbens Island leaves from here as do various boat trips for sunset cruises and sightseeing.Most of the shops are the usual high end ones that appear everywhere in the world but there are a few which are quite unique - one of them being a market type stall within the mall - ground floor- which sells beaded animals. The amount of work put into these looks pretty intense and we were happy to buy some of our favourites here. They came with a concierge service!! The Turkish lady who runs this stall is a font of info on Cape Town and is happy to share it all - along with her views on every worldwide situation you can possibly imagine!! We got some great recommendations for restaurants from here - The Harbour House and Baia (both fantastic) - and spent some time swopping views!The Cape wheel is really inexpensive and gives a good all round view, especially nice at night when everything is lit up.Don't miss another, smaller, area just off here, towards the V & A hotel, just past the lifeboat. Great ladieswear shop inside - Lulus? - well worth an hour of browsing and trying on and just outside it there is a good souvenir shop. Further along is a wonderful shop with lifesize animals etc. Even better is a bar where your other half can sit with a beer whilst you are otherwise occupied!At least once during your trip here you will hear singing from groups of men - usually all in the same African dress - very entertaining to listen to but be aware they will want paying for their time and any photos you might take of them. We thought they were worth it. Just past the lifeboat is a large tree where they like to perform during the day and there is a very conveniently placed restaurant here for you to eat and drink whilst this is all going on.We were here every evening during the Cape Town stage of our trip, great food and people watching."

The waterfront is definitely wroth a visit for shopping - prices way cheaper than UK for quality products - eating - visit the food market hall - and absorbing the general atmosphere. my favourite part was the Watershed full of local craft stalls which were very reasonably priced and although you could barter a bit it saved the hassle of market bartering. The restaurants were numerous but looked rather international and soulless to us. We preferred eating in more local establishments in other parts of the city. Parking was easy and it was a pleasant way to spend a few hours. I would avoid weekends as I would imagine it is heaving."

The mall is certainly set up for tourists to enjoy the variety of stores and restaurants to eat from. Its great that additional parking has been built across the mall. It is however sad that there are no more live jazz restaurants around like Manenberg's that was at the Clock Tower and the Green Dolphin.

The staff in ocean basket restaurant, pick n pay supermarket and ferrymans bar have amongst them, the rudest staff members and worst customer service I have seen in a while! Being black myself, I would have expected the black South Africans to treat me with atleast basic human dignity but instead, I was given dirty looks, disrespectful service (no greeting, no help packing the bags and they didn't even tell me my total price!!!!)!from the checkout assistants at pick n pay supermarket in the Victoria mall. The staff in ocean basket restaurant in Victoria mall ignored me and I only wanted a takeaway! Instead of being helpful, I had to approach them so my order could be taken. I waited about 20mins on top of the 20mins they told me I would wait and when my food was ready to come to me, they left it on the side for about 15 mins so when my food arrived it was cold!!!! The ferrymans bar ignored my existence too. I don't know if it's a jealous thing as we are both black but they are serving me so they much treat me in nasty manner but management should change this quickly as the popularity is likely to decrease if this continues. It's like a form of xenophobia on the black South Africans part because white afrikanas were treated properly!! They staff must think my money isn't as good as theirs so they treat me like a second hand citizen"

If you're going there, seek out the two local African themed stores that are next to each other. Their prices were good. There are also a number of kiosks with African made items.

Lots of excursions are available from here - sunset cruises, harbour cruises, kayaking for the brave, hellicopter rides, a ride on the Cape Town Wheel ( SA's answer to the London Eye), a trip down rugby's memory lane at the Rugby Museum, a glimpse of life under the sea at the Aquarium ( one of THE best outings for kids), free entertainment most weekends in the amphitheater, a stunning jungle gym with water play next to it for the kiddos, so much I can't think of everything right now. The craft market is worth a visit, so is the scratch patch (collect semi precious stones to take home) and cave golf is fun. All in all you won't regret a visit to the Waterfront.

So much to see and do, either shopping or eating at the many seafood restaurants you will be consumed by the atmosphere it grabs you by the arm and leads you from one interesting craft shop or eatery to another place of enjoyment."

It is difficult to pin point a specific location as there is something for everyone...adults, teens and younger children. During my visits there ( 2 days) I had a wonderful seafood dinner at a local restaurant on the main strip and across from the ocean. I was fascinated with the large Ferris-wheel and due to the long lines I decided not to venture there. In stead I visited the Water Shed that had many various stores and vendors selling their specific creative wares. This included hats, costume jewelry, flowers, clothing, house-hold wares and much more. After making several purchases I continued to the mall. Here there are also many stores at this location, including restaurants (some USA chains) a hotel, easy to reach rest rooms and much more. If you are in the market for diamond jewelry, visit Shimansky, located in the Clock Tower, and take a tour of their diamond factory. You will come away with a much improved knowledge of how diamonds are crafted and will likely be able to select your diamond choice be it large or small with confidence. in addition the staff is professional, helpful but not pushy. If you want to try different ethnic foods, tour the area that has anything that you have a taste for. At most stops the food is cooked while you wait guaranteeing freshness. You and your family are in for a fun filled day. Enjoy!"

Our first visit was in the morning and it was quiet, we wandered around the shops and I managed not to immediately buy a fluffy baboon in the gift shop although I succumbed during our next visit. The shops are varied and goods are reasonably priced which is often not the case at tourist attractions.There is a wide choice of excursions you can arrange, boat trips around the harbour, visit to the island where Nelson Mendala was imprisoned, trips around Cape Town. It's a good location to choose and book trips.There are loads of different cafes and restaurants to choose from and prices are very reasonable.There's a huge wheel on which you can ride and see all over the harbour when you're at the top. At first. I wasn't sure if it was a bit incongruent but it sort of fitted in and at night when it's all lit up, it looks lovely.There is outside entertainment and it's especially good at night when groups of people are standing around watching and, on occasions, joining in. There's a brilliant magician and the bands are great and change frequently so it's not the same thing all the time.At night it's really exciting but feels very safe. During the day it's more relaxing and you can sit and watch the seals swimming in the harbour or lounging on a small concrete space which has been reserved for them.I really enjoyed the Waterfront ... It's a great place to wander around during the day or at night and it feels very safe."

There are fun-ish activities for tourist: helicopter rides. Harbor tours. Seals. What you won't see are Capetonians. My friends told me they around the waterfront, let the tourists have the run of it.You have to go, at least once. It's fine for a beer and lunch on a sunny day.

It surpassed my expectations with loads of shops, cafe's, bar's and restaurant's that were full of family's and couples eating chatting and taking in the early evening sun. We ate dinner on the upper deck and returned later in the evening to visit a couple of bars for a couple of night caps.I will definitely visit again when we return to South Africa."

Catch a boat for a 20 to 40 minutes harbour cruise. Check out the indoor malls for souvenirs when outside is too hot."

The Aquarium is a great attraction and boat trips can be taken into the working harbour and out to sea and Robben Island. It was quiet exciting to see the Tower clock and seeing the bridge move completely out as to get other boats with tall sails to pass by, and there after when the boats passed, the bridge comes together again so pedestrians can cross the other side.Why with one mall then you three yes V&A, Victoria Wharf and the Alfred mall and pier head plus the clock tower district renovated Shopping Mall in Victorian Style. just where to you begin??

We particularly liked the Mondiall its always busy but the cocktails are good while you wait. The food was excellent we had steaks. Opposite this is the Hildeband this is good for a long lunch time on the patio on the harbour side. We also went to Quay Four the seafood platter is amazing and so cheap as is everywhere at the moment.For drinks the Ferrymans bar is good with regular live music and decent bar food through the day.There are also several eateries attached to the shopping mall we didn't try them as there are so many but some others on our trip said the steak grill was one to try.The shopping mall is also pretty good with lots of designer shops if that floats your boat.The jewel in the crown was Shimmys Beach club its a little walk to the clock tower and then a free shuttle bus (only two minutes) but it is a place you can pend all day there is a few bars and a pool with sun loungers and the restaurant is very good, they do sushi and fish as well as all the usuals. You can sit and watch the boats going in and out of the harbour as you eat drink or relax.I could say so much more about this area the boat trips are good the live impromptu music and dancing around the area by the locals is great for a watch.You will enjoy !!!!!"

Hi PeopleMe again,and what an NYE experience that the V&A Waterfront Cape Town have us.From breathtaking views especially for the selfie mad,picture craze junkies you can not get enough ,to the various local artist performing live at various stages of the Waterfront. This was my first New Year's Eve at the Waterfront and it didn't disappoint ,the artist,food stalls,and especially the fireworks at the count down was all on par.The was some congestion going to certain areas of the waterfront and my suggestion to people planning to there on a NYE is to pre book a restaurant of your choice as all the restaurants was fully book with some sort of live entertainment and various themed parties happening,this is just to prevent any running around if you are keen on not scouting the place.There is so many fast food places available ,the wait was somewhat long but that's a NYE at the waterfront for you.Everything else went down amazing,the weather as always was perfect and it was an amazing way to stry off 2016.For your next trip to Cape Town try an NYE party at the Waterfront."

Very interesting. Some have characterized it as too touristy, but we found it a worthy stop for an hour or two. Not tacky at all, and as mentioned, a great place to pick up some fresh food, or a craft or piece of art. Build this in before or after a boat ride or trip to Robben Island."

Perfect for a day visit and open all year round. Always buzzing with locals and tourist daily. A true rainbow nation culture . Shopping business hours apply,but fast food outlets and restaurants stays open till late. Water/sea only accessible by boat cruise in harbour. You may even spot seals lazing around in the harbour by taking a walk around. Be sure to visit the 2 Oceans Aquarium. Perfect visit for kids all ages & family with endless actives in store. Entry fees apply. And personal must is to take a ferry across to Robin Island. Excellent tour installed with a great history lesson awaiting. The V& A is accessible by all modes of transport for all people. Definately disability friendly . Each visit promises to be different."

In general the restaurants here are very hit and miss, it's well worth venturing away from the V&A to eat, but the shopping and markets are amazing. The scenery is beautiful and it's lit up beautifully at night. It feels very safe at any time of day due to the high security presence which you don't get in most other parts of the city, let alone the rest of SA. There are very expensive hotels here, but there are also apartments and smaller hotels in-between so it's a varied area, with street performances, mixed shopping and souvenirs and beautiful views of table mountain. Even if you aren't staying here or like to get \"off the beaten path\" I think its well worth the jaunt to the waterfront to check it out one morning or afternoon."

It was pretty crowded and hot when we were there, so it wasn't a long trip, but good afternoon activity for families and couples"

Despite this, the mall tends to get very crowded (and personally I don't like crowded areas). The mall also has some nice eateries and boasts various types of cuisine to suit desires of most.If you are looking for seclusion in the festive season, try bigger malls like Canal Walk which MAY have fewer people (probably because everyone is at V&A, i dont know) - when i went to Canal, there were no crowds although it was before lunch time.The worst of V&A was the 31st December - i went there to see the display of fireworks as we ushered in 2016 but geeez the place was sooo packed there was hardly space to move around. If you want space to just sit and watch the fireworks, I suggest making a reservation at one of the restaurants on the waterfront, their prices ranges between R1 400 - R1 750 per person for between five to eight course meals. Other than that, other fat food places closed at 10pm and many were turned away. The display of fireworks was absolutely amazing and the vibe just awesome as everyone counted down together into 2016. On other days, musicians can be seen performing local hits and sharing local tunes with all who are present. There are lots of souvenit shops which sell mostly African or uniquely South African items. There's the Cape Wheel which you can go on to see views of the Cape from above and there is also a kiddies area at the waterfront.The hop on hop off bus departs from here first daily and several other tour operators have boat rides from here throughout the day. The ferry to Robben Island also leaves from here."

The waterfront is so trendy and truly has something for everyone from McDonalds/Steers for a burger to City Grill/Karibu for a zebra or ostrich steak. There are cocktail bars and pubs such as Ferrimans, sushi and noodle bars and hundreds of shops. The great thing about all of Cape Town is the price of beers - on the Waterfront you can expect to pay the equivalent of just over \u00a31 for a beer and around \u00a33-3.50 for a cocktail (including champagne cocktails). Food is also extremely reasonable. The shopping at the Waterfront is highstreet/designer and is about the same price as shopping in the UK, I have yet to discover any real bargains on the clothes front in Cape Town. I would avoid Quay Four at all costs. It appears to be good, due to often having queues outside, but I can only imagine these people queuing don't know its reputation. The view from the restaurant is fantastic, but that is where it ends, the food is awful. Every other restaurant we have tried on the Waterfront has been fantastic, you are spoilt for choice. No need to waste time or money at a less than average restaurant. All in all, the Waterfront has something for everyone. There is also a man there selling safaris to Aquila big 5 safari - I would recommend doing the overnight one if you have time on your trip - we did and it was wonderful! only \u00a390 each for self drive to Aquila which is a lovely and easy <2hr drive from Cape Town!"

It is really nice to come here for an evening stroll Etc. There are sunset rises, helicopter rides, ferris wheel... the attractions just go on and on. There are many restaurants to choose from and a lot of them overlook the harbour so it is also very nice.

You get to walk all around the harbour and see all the ships coming and going. You can also go on a boat trip if you'd like.Keep an eye out for the seals in the water! They are quite used to people and will come close.Stop at at least one of the local artists standing around the V&A and enjoy their talents, whether it is singing, drawing, acting or whatever. They can be real gems!Find a restaurant that fits your budget. Most of the restaurants next to the water are quite expensive, so look for one behind them, or go into the mall to find some cheaper restaurants."

There is a building located that is somewhat of a food court and offers a versatile menu. We loved eating lunch there every day for a week. When we were there in August they closed around 6 so be sure to go early enough to be able to enjoy their offerings.

There is always live music/performers to enjoy, excellent restaurants, and activities for adults and children alike. Many of the shopping malls are full of high-end retailers, but there are also niche retailers for over-priced gift ideas for family (the same the world over). Many cruise liners take port there and are a real spectacle as they enter the harbour. There are plenty of high-end hotel options at the Waterfront, as you would expect, but also apartment rentals available. We stayed in Cape Town for 10 days and visited the Waterfront 4-5 times.

You will be pleasantly surprised at the extensive number of quality stores and good available and tempted over and over by the number of fun and interesting restaurants and public facilities. The three story building is nicely designed with now beautiful Holiday decorations Best of all, with the value of the dollar at 14 Rand,, prices are very reasonable. The Vitoria & Alfred Waterfront is worth a visit, even if you don't need to purchase anything and a must visit if you do."

It's a family friendly venue to boot (well attended, ample security, etc.).That being said, there are a number of worthwhile venues around the city for dining, shopping, and entertainment (many within walking distance of the V&A). Cape Quarter is a great example. It's small but much less congested. You can sit for a coffee or eat and it houses a well stocked Spar market for all your needs.There are thousands of reviews for the Waterfront many with helpful tips or advice. My recommendation is enjoy the Waterfront but don't trap yourself there. It's easy to do."

Here you can get a boat trip round the harbour and see the seals which laze about in the bay. Some of the shops are very expensive the main tip is if they dont show the price in the window be prepared for high prices when you go in but over all its a day out and like most other malls in the world you can easily spend the whole day there."

If you like shopping, the mall gives you high-end options with department stores (Woolworths), clothes and shoes (H&M, Zara, Aldo), and cosmetics (MAC, Crabtree & Evelyn) while more affordably priced craft is available at the Watershed. If you're a foodie, get ready for the widest variety of cuisine. From Tunisian, to South African, to Asian, Italian, whatever you're craving you'll find it there. I recommend the Food Market which has many mini restaurants serving dishes as diverse as empanadas, specialty cheeses, dim sum, baclava, Cape malay chicken wraps and German pastries. All of this at an affordable price, mind you. Another great choice is the Fishmarket Restaurant for seafood.Or you could just take a walk through and enjoy the ambience, enjoy the Cape sunsets!"

It is easily accessible via public transport or if you prefer driving there, parking fees are quite affordable. Whether you're a foodie, a shop-a-holic, a cult-vult or just simply enjoy eclectic sights and sounds, then this is the go-to place! At the V & A Waterfront, you'll never be bored as there is always entertainment, shops, restaurants and activities to attract every member of the family.

You can walk all the way from The Table Bay Hotel, all along the quay past boats of all shapes and sizes and restaurants catering to almost every cuisine. Following the cobble stones you can walk past the Wheel of Excellence (which offers an entirely different view of False Bay and Cape Town). Continue walking until you find the Belgian restaurant where you can take an iconic picture of Table Mountain.If you continue even further you will cross a bridge and there you can visit the famous Clock Tower or take the ferry to visit Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years. It is a grave experience, but one that I would recommend. I think it is necessary for people to know the good and the bad parts of history.Visiting the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront is quite an exciting experience - for locals and tourists. Enjoy!"

There are Several indoor & outdoor restaurants with great food all along the dock You can sit outside to eat & watch all the boats coming & going. you can take a boat ride tour Robin Island from there which I would highly recommend. Also there is a huge locally handcrafted market which offers a vast variety of beautiful work. Definitely a must to spend a day there."

The whole waterfront area is great to walk around and enjoy the water views, the mountain, the entertainers and the general vibe. It is a fun place day or night, but I enjoy walking during the day, watching the seals play in the water, seeing what kinds of boats are in the dry-dock for repairs, looking at the crafts and just enjoying a great view. There are many great restaurants at all price levels. One of my favorites is the inexpensive but quite tasty seafood at Ocean Basket, sitting outside near the big wheel. I also enjoy having lunch at one of the restaurants on the upper level of the mall on the backside facing the open water. The new Water Shed craft building is quite nice as well. It replaced the blue and red shed craft areas with a clean new well lit area that makes shopping easy."

Savruga is one of our favourite restaurants for sushi - perfect seating outside for sundowners. The views from the harbour of Table Mountain are amazing. There is lots of parking and if you want to take the public transport the MyCiti Bus take you into right into the waterfront. There is just so much to do - you can take the boat trips out to sea and in the summer the dolphins swim and play alongside the boats. A great time in good or bad weather."

Walk around the V & A Waterfront, coffee in hand, and enjoy the crisp sunny air, palm tree-lined boardwalk overlooking the crashing waves, colorfully painted fishing boats pulling in and out of the classic and character-filled harbor. The expansive mall is never-ending and gives way to hundreds of shops and eateries, some with balconies overlooking the action outside. Live music and street performers accompanied our private sunset with wine in hand, overlooking the gorgeous Table Mountain and beautiful water. A little touristy? Yes - but a place to visit when in Cape Town for sure!"

We stayed at the waterfront and the area felt safe to walkabout on your own with security guards dotted all over the place either watching boats or residences in the area.The waterfront is fantastic place to find food with plentiful supply of restaurants and a huge pick and pay supermarket. It is a very pleasant area to spend an evening relaxing.there are pubs for cheap dining and there are fine dining restarants available,fare to suit every pocket.In the day there are numerous boat rides into the bay available and cafes to spend time looking out onto the sea,one of the trips available was Robben Island to visit the cell where Nelson Mandella spent most of his time while in prison.There is a huge Ferris wheel which is a good landmark for the area and a cool ride.Something for everyone including the ardent shopper, plenty of shops available for you to spend your Rand."

I also took Cape Town tours from there. The mall is wonderfull with high end brands like Burberry and Louis Voitton and retail shops like Mango and Zara. The dining choices are numerous and you are bound to meet your craving. There are even some Halal restaurants. The mall is very clean and well served. There is a giant wheel infornt of the mall and bistros around it. It is very safe there with an army of security personnel to insure your peace of mind. The mall has everything you might need from diamonds to groceries. The mall is smoking free but there are places designated for smokers. The aquarium is adjacent to the Waterfront and besides it great handcarts shop with nice cafes."

We watched a film at the nu-metro cinema and it was a pleasant experience. I would highly recommend the Food Market. The Mexican wraps, Hungarian flatbread with salmon, smoothies and vegan stores offered wonderful food. The samoosa place was overpriced (5 samoosas for R45) - so avoid that unless you really really want samoosas. Having visited the Cape Union Mart there twice, I can recommend using the store. Apart from the large variety of items, the staff are friendly and very knowledgeable.I bought a groupon for a ride on the Cape Wheel where I got 2 tickets for R100 but I wouldn't do it at full price (R100 per person for 15 minutes)."

It's full of goodies made by local companies that are good quality and not cheap looking like the most craft places i'm used to seeing. Also next store to that is a food market which was a whole bunch of different vendors opened to 6pm as well. HINT - there is a bar uptop and a cool vendor downstairs that sells amazing beers from a cooler. My family and i had a fun time eating different things, checking out the crafts and buying touristy things to take back home.

There is a guided walk but I elected to make my own way round, following the signboards which give detailed information of all the stops on the walk. I went to the V&A every day of my holiday for one reason or another: to book my tour to Cape Point, to start the tour to Robben Island, to catch the boat for the sunset harbour cruise, to watch the street entertainers, to see the sea lions, to buy some lovely Cape Town books but mainly to eat and drink. There are any number of restaurants and bars to suit all tastes and price ranges, although nothing is expensive \u2013 most evenings I had delicious seafood and two or three glasses of Cape wine for less than 200 Rand (\u00a310).

There is quite a large mall that quite frankly could be anywhere in the world. Great if you need something, otherwise not very interesting. Our favourite parts of the Waterfront were the Watershed building where there are all sorts of local crafts (some crafty some touristy) but at least it is not stuff you see in every shop in every country around the world. We picked up some really nice mementos and gifts here. We also loved the food market with the variety of stalls serving all sorts of food. Travelling with a 17 year old boy we are ALWAYS on the look out for food as he tends to ALWAYS be hungry.Casual, varied and inexpensive - PERFECT.We also had a lovely meal at one of the restaurants - lots of meat but that is to be expected as it was a steak restaurant."

Lovely but a bit more pricey food can be found in the Belgian restaurant \"Den Anker\", more typical food is provided in the Traditional Food Market. The central Mall offers a nice variation of shops. If lucky Table Mountain is visible without clouds. Watch out for the big frame from where one can take nice TM pictures.

A lot of the water based tours of Cape Town depart from the V&A Waterfront (for example, our tour to Robben Island) ... so if you're looking for something to do, you can always wander around and see what's on offer.A great place to start or finish (or as we did, spend the entire time) your holiday in Cape Town."

We had a bad experience as we did not want the non-metered taxi and when a metered taxi dropped off a passenger we got into that taxi. The non-metered taxi guy became aggressive and abusive towards the metered taxi driver. Hint. Walked outside on the main road and grab a metered taxi."

No one got in without the proper authorisation or electronic keys. It was fully equipped with good working condition appliance for self-catering and was clean. It was clean and extremely homely. To add to this it was walking distance to all the top-notch restaurants, the harbour front and even the aquarium. So in the evenings we did our own thing and explored the area. We even walked to catch the ferry from the harbour to Robben Island. The only complain I may have is a minor one. I felt that the cleaners weren't always through with their cleaning and I had to remind them a few times to change the sheets since it is part of their service to change it every other day. Perhaps it is a petty thing but if you are entitled to clean sheets every other day and you have paid for you, shouldn't it be fulfilled? Otherwise it is a fantastic place to spend your holidays with family or just as couples especially when you know you are completely safe."

The shopping can be pricey so be careful not to buy too many luxury items at this mall. Enjoy!"

Its a good place to unwind, whether in one of the many restaurants, boat riding, viewing cultural activities that vary daily, shopping from exclusive shops, observing and taking photos with key points such as Table Mountain, The New Stadium, Roben Island as background or just enjoy walking around with a sense of security. This is one place one should never miss visiting when in Cape Town."

When we had finished the Robbens Island tour, we walked through the area and had dinner at a fish restaurant across from the Robbens Island gateway building. The V&A waterfront is pretty typical, in that it is very much a \"tourist\" focused area. It is worth a visit and if the day is clear you can see Robbens Island from the dock."

If you don't have a clue what to do in Capetown then you could just sit here and watch life drift by. There are some great shops here but they are rather highly priced. I got carried away in one clothes shop and spent a bomb when I converted back to Australian dollars. I think that this area is definitely a tourist trap as the rest of Capetown is extremely reasonably priced. However, that said, it is a great place to sit in the outdoors caf\u00e9 and have a coffee and bliss out. It definitely reminded me of Sydney's Darling Harbour and I think that I might even have been told by someone that the area was actually modelled on Darling Harbour. I am feeling like going back there just by writing this review. Definitely come here when you go to Capetown."

Unfortunately a few nice shops and restaurants have had to close due to lack of funds or lack of public interest. In any case, always worth a visit whether it's to shop, catch a movie, stay at a hotel, go dining or to get a drink. Opeingin hours for shops are also usually longer than in other areas of Cape Town, especially on weekends. There are also major attractions there including the big wheel and the Aquarium.

The Victoria & Alfred Waterfront is an area full of quality shopping and dining and, as well, the area from which one catches the boat to Robben Island.Many of the sorts of handicrafts that I saw at Green Market Square were also available from stalls in the Watershed. As I am not really keen on bargaining, I found purchasing things at the Watershed to be a more comfortable experience.Some hotels offer free shuttles to and from the Waterfront area. If you are planning on taking a taxi, make sure that your driver turns on his meter."

From the V&A you can explore Robben Island (the prison where Nelson Mandela was incarceeated for 27 years) . If adventerous or need to save take a helicopter flip over the peninsula ir even the winelands. You can be dropped off with the red citi-hopper or a take a trip on the ferry wheel. Then see any one of the current movies, eat in the many varied restaurants from coffee shops to the food court. Then there are the family restaurants and the more upmarket establishments. You can then shop at all the brand name and local chain stores . Popular locals include woolworths, clicks, Pick n Pay, clothing, book, jewellers, luggage and more. Don't forget to visit the aquarium, open markets, a cruise around the harbour or Clifton or even Hout Bay. Plenty Hotels in the area from BUDGET to Five Stars. It's more the destination than the local shopping centre. There are more affordable and varied shops at he large Canal Walk shopping centre which is almost a must. If it's school holidays leave the kids at Ratanga for entertainment and rides."

The food market it small and quaint but they have enough diversity and tasty treats to make it worth it - especially if you want to get a flare of local street style foods. The craft market is unlike the cheap souvenir shops as everything seems be well crafted, hand made, local and has a truly artistic/craft skill involved.

Parking is always easy and plentiful. I do always find the shopping centre a little overcrowded every time I go. Plenty of shops, loads of food places and a cinema. If you get a tip off a cruise ship is arriving run for the hills, seems to small to handle such a rush of people."

There is also a lot of street activity happening around the place - it is indeed a nice place to hang out.Overall a touristy place - worth the visit"

There were also many other shops with souvenir and locally made items, restaurants, and Two Oceans Aquarium which is a small aquarium with an excellent kelp exhibit and rockhopper penguins."

While you're in Cape Town, don't let this be your only shopping experience-- the Old Biscuit Mill, and it's Good Neighbors Market, with delicious, organic food stalls open Saturday only, are well worth the trip to the Woodstockneighborhood, and seem less touristy and more organic.

I've always thought of the Waterfront as a terrible tourist trap mall, primarily since I've always approached it from the underground parking areas. In the summer is it certainly packed with tourists and all of the trappings of tourism, but for the last 5 months I've been working near the Waterfront and decided to explore a bit. If you approach it from the Cape Grace Hotel, you can walk along the canal, past the grand floating mansions of the rich, across the charming little drawbridge, past the dry dock where they might be cleaning tugboats or fishing boats, then approach the tourist area welcomed by the statues of Mandela, Tutu, DeKlerk, and Luthuli in Noble Square. There is a great food market featuring a slightly more healthy and fresh fare than the fast food stalls inside the mall, and the recent remodel of the Design Center is a terrific showcase for crafts and handmade goods. You can escape the mall entirely, by staying close to the water, heading to the Clock Tower, and walk alongside the docks past the construction site for the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art, due to open in 2017. I've loved this walk during my lunch hour!"

The V&A is home to some of Cape Town's best restaurants and hotels, it's definitive collection of luxury retail brands, and big attractions like Robben Island cruises, the Two Oceans Aquarium (no nasty dolphin shows or captive whales!) and sunset cruises to nearby Camps Bay and Cape Town's Eye (not as big as London's but well worth the ticket price on a clear summer's evening). It's essentially a vast shopping mall set in Cape Town's very pretty working harbour with picture postcard views of Table Mountain and a strategic set of attractions dispersed between the shops, restaurants and hotels. There is plenty for everyone to do: families, couples and friends too. In summer, there are often quality performers in the public spaces - dancers, majembe bands and even acrobats. That makes the V&A a very popular and busy place that can occasionally be quite pricey. All in all, as long as you know you're going to a beautiful, busy, well-planned mall, I think it's a great collection of attractions in a gorgeous setting and highly recommended."

Whilst have lunch you have ample opportunity to people watch and also watch the many boat trips coming and going from the harbor.Inside there are many shops to browse - my girlfriend can always find something to buy!Add in the opportunity to get an alternative view of the area by riding in the Cape Town wheel. You will always find a single of group of buskers playing music in the area and if you want somewhere will sketch your portrait for you.I feel blessed to be able to enjoy the waterfront every week of the year."

Nature is bountiful here and the seas offer up amazing fish - try snoek, a meaty flat fish, kingklip and luxuriously huge crayfish and prawns, inexpensive compared with the rest of the world. Cape Town has always been a mixture of many influences, now further enhanced by the influx of global tourism. As a result you can find pretty much any kind of cuisine you want here, done well and with the freshest ingredients - including the spicy local cuisine Cape Malay. Look out for outstanding Italian restaurants - a result of the big Italian community in Cape Town, descended from migrant workers who came to work on the South African railways. The V&A Waterfront is a great place to eat, you\u2019ll find everything from starched table clothed restaurants to street food here. Other great spots include Camps Bay and trendy Green Point, the so-called \u201cSoho of Cape Town\u201d."

On my visit I was lucky enough to see a band called 'We are Africa' so their T shirts read, a four piece combo who play instruments similar in appearance to a xlyphone but gave a sound like a Jamaican steel drum, but what made them even more original was the lead singer who got up on a concrete plinth, folded his arms across his chest and gave a spirited rendition of 'O Sole Mio'!!!

If you are not fussy about eating at a restaurant, you can pop into the waterfront food market where you get everything from ice creams to cakes to sandwiches, burgers etc all under same roof. They have benches by the water where you can sit and enjoy your meal and probably also spot a seal or two swim by. There is also a food court with indoor seating. I would recommend to anyone visiting water front to pop into one of the many restaurants that offer gorgeous harbor views as the views are to die for"

Woolworths (better fruit and vegetables) and Pick n Pay (cheaper) are the supermarkets. @Home and Woolworths have things for the house, Clicks is the a huge pharmacy, Nespresso, Zara, Cotton On, Top Shop, Gstar, Country Road and Trenery, Calvin Klein, and the expensive brands such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Burberrys, etc which i hardly buy so i wouldnt know much about them. You have entertaingin for kids outside as well as a small amphitheater. Saturdays ans sundays during summer is pure joy, there is small african bands playing live and dancing, and the Cape Wheel, with a stunning view to the Table Mountain. Its a must go if you come to CT"

If you're looking for a convenient place to eat, then go to the food court where you can find Pizza, Burgers, Fish & Chips, Asian food and frozen yoghurt (and almost all are halal).But, other than this, it's just a huge tourist trap.It's filled with over-priced shops, at which your regular South African will never be able to afford to shop. And, most of the time, the clothes, bags and shoes, are just regular quality, Chinese-manufactured items, polished and displayed perfectly, so that they can add a hefty price tag. Europeans and Americans, beware! You are the target market of these shops... if you find something that you really, really like, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, spend your $$$ on food or drinks, or at the market, or a boat ride, or transport to explore the other areas outside of CT."

This area is the hub of Cape Town as far as tourists are concerned so you need to think about how much you are paying at many of the shops and restaurants. There are reasonable things within the centre and one restaurant that really stood out for us called Cape Town Fish Market. The biggest fish restaurant we have ever seen with separate sushi bar, fish and chip department, and main seating area. The main area is waiter service with everything available from a menu including many fish dishes cooked in many different ways. Prices where very much lower than most of the other places we reviewed the menu at, although in all fairness if you are out to impress your companion and need a waiter in a bow tie, and fewer people around you this may not be your place. We loved it and the quality of the food could not be beaten as judging by the crowds and sometimes the ques waiting for a table most of Cape Town must agree.Close by but not inside the Victoria & Alfred is a craft market, a snack bar, coffee shop, and cafe area, and an aquarium. We bought most of our gifts in the craft market hand made local products, we drank the best coffee in Cape Town, and enjoyed a fantastic fish feeding session in the aquarium where divers fed the fish, in what must be one of the worlds biggest fish tanks, whilst fending of massive sharks. You got to see it to believe it."

As far as I can, I try to take them everywhere I can..For that purpose I have a doggy stroller where they are safely tucked in against any harm..I tried to cover them up with a baby blanket so that nobody can see I am not pushing a pram with a baby in, but yorkies..A shop owner then told me it was completely unneccary as they are welcome because they are in a stroller and out of the way...I really felt most welcome and thusfore will pay them a visit with my yorkies whenever I am in CT..This is the mall where you can feel the relax atmosphere with all the holiday makers strolling down the aisle.."

The only thing going for it really, is it's location. You have easy access to the Waterfront with many restaurants and things to do, and hence you don't need to drive much.The rooms are clean, nothing spectacular to report there. The hotel itself is styled on a colonial theme, a theme which in my view, is outdated. The staff are efficient but not great. The food is okay. The decor is white and a dark grey which gives the hotel a drab atmosphere.Cape Town is such a beautiful place to visit and if you are considering it, there are many fantastic hotels to choose from,the V&A is not one of them...."

There are still masses of attractions, the aquarium and museums as well as the shops but irt has grown considerably since we were last here and while some innovations like the canal are good the number of large hotels, appartment blocks, and offices that are beginning to encircle the harbour are in danger of changing the ambience. It is great to be able to park your yacht outside your appartment on the canal but you relise that by doing so you are advertising that your yacht is rather small compared with those too large to gettthrough the canal dock!!"

Unique vendor stalls, and an entire renovated industrial building filled with delicious food/snacks. Definitely worth the trip. We actually even went back for some more good food, but were sorry to see that some of the food attractions closed at 5PM. The bigger restaurants were all open much later, so we had a good meal oceanside. Seems there's always music, and if you like the standard shopping mall, they have that as well."

I felt safe whilst walking around the outdoor shops as well as through the connecting shopping centre. Catching a cab from the main cab rank is a little different- some cabs in Cape Town (and South Africa) are reliable and honest whilst others will try to rip you off by not putting the meter on or modifying the meter to run at twice the usual speed. The dodgy cabs are usually old run down cars without permanent cab signs. I recommend walking over to the Table Bay hotel and asking them to call you a cab- this way you will get a reliable and honest cab driver."

You can take a guided historical tour for which you must book.Alternatively do the self-guided walking tour. This starts and ends at the Information Centre as they have a free map from which you follow a series of numbered boards with all the information.

First of all, if you are one of those who has a \u201cmovie idea of South Africa, let me invite you to open your mind wide and let me impress you with a reality that goes further than Safaris, hiding the amazing Amazing Rainbow Nation.Rainbow land is the name that Nelson Mandela gave to South Africa after his release of 27 years from prison in Robben island. In Mandela\u2019s interpretation the name \u201cRainbow Nation\u201d remained a place with people of all races, therefore of different colors, who live in peace building the most beautiful view for all the eyes around and that is the perfect description to CAPE TOWN.However, in my opinion, to call a country \u201cTHE RAINBOW NATION\u201d leverages unbelievable characteristics that make it such a magical place as Cape Town is.THE RAINBOW NATION... BY ITS BEAUTIFUL WOMENI am a latin-american woman, who was rased with the american and european concept of beauty. I did all the chemical hair processes available to transform my hair from almost curly (I would like to say that my hair was curly enough to have an afro, but that would be a lie) to straight. But the capetonian women are proud, at least now, of their physical features. They use their hair in the original texture, with high volume and all kind of colors in their highlights; they emphasize it even more using colorful hair craft. So, my peace of advise is\u2026If you are single and are ready to go to south Africa be prepared to be overshadowed (In case of being a woman), or Enchanted (in case of being a man) for these goddesses with black skin but hair in all the rainbow colorsTHE RAINBOW NATION\u2026BY ITS FOODOk, here is a personal revelation. I am not too much into the food. For me the company around the food or how trendy or lovely is the place/restaurant where I eat is the more important.For that reason this is the topic less relevant in this rewiev, nonetheless as a sign of my good intention, to give a complete recap of my South Africa\u2019s trip, I will write five brief tips\u2026 1)English Breakfast is available in all the Hotel Buffets. 2) Indian cuisine is the best in relation to cost and quality 3) If you are a meat lover, you need to taste Alligator meat. 4) The average wine\u2019s price of a world class bottle of wine is less than 20 american dollar 5) Biltong a variety of dried, cured meat is the most iconic African food souvenir THE REAINBOW NATION\u2026BT ITS HISTORYSaving the best for last\u2026 If you are a nerd such as me, you will love South Africa. Unlike Europe where everything and everyplace is well known in South Africa you are continually surprised with new information each minute. IMPORTANT WARNING: I am from Colombia and the basic worldwide historical information that we receive at school is focused in USA and Europe.Some of the most interesting insights that I learned during my trip were:1) Cape Town is one of the most multicultural cities in the world, about 3.5-million people live there.2) The world\u2019s first heart transplant was performed by Dr Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town in 1967.3) The city\u2019s motto is \u201cSpes Bona\u201d, which is Latin for \u201cgood hope\u201d, a relevant motto for WSPID 2013.4) Cape Town is sometimes called the \u201cTavern of the seas\". The Port of Cape Town is deemed to be one of the busiest shipping corridors in the world. 5) Cape Town was named the World Design Capital for 2014 by the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design.Well, I don't know if I was capable of describing how much I like Cape Town, but by far is one of the trips that I will remember forever."

On the Red Bus tour on our first day, the commentary suggested that the V&A Waterfront was modelled on Sydney and San Francisco but that they thought they had taken it a little further. That made me wonder if this was just a bit of hype. However, our first (because there will be others before we finish our holiday) venture into the Waterfront was a wonderful experience. The first place we visited was the Market on the Wharf and we were completely blown away. A bewildering array of wonderful smells and stall after stall of fantastic food, all beautifully presented. No one hassles you - you can taste many of the goodies on offer before committing to a purchase. Friendly people and lots to see. Next, we visited the Watershed which has a huge range of crafts, clothing, jewellery, ceramics and the like on offer, all in a big light and airy space - no tat anywhere. Again, really helpful, friendly people. We could have spent another couple of hours there alone. We emerged just in time to catch the last couple of songs by a band called the Parletones that were doing an impromptu, free concert in the Amphitheatre. Finally, we had a good look around the Victoria Wharf Shopping Centre which, on the surface, was 'just another mall' but actually turned out to be a really interesting place to window shop and people watch. We're nowhere close to having seen all that the Waterfront has to offer - but we'll be back to pick up where we left off. Highly recommended."

It was packed with people most of the time. The views of the table mountain were stunning. There is a small harbour were boats take off from. The main attraction for me were the many restaurants were we sat at ocean basket resturant and enjoyed a meal as the sun set. It was windy at the resturant but we endured just to enjoy the views. They were various people doing all sorts of entertaining activities from traditional dancing , ball juggling , fire spitting . We were warned that thieves are rampant at these activities. For the discerning shopper there are many shops in the mall. The price of goods at most shops is inflated .I went to the statues of the Nobel price winners . There are statues of Nelson Mandela , Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, W de Klerk and a forth guy. There were the architects of the new South Africa. The only disappointing thing was how the statue is Mandela remotely looked like him."

Whether it`s taking the ferry to Robben Island, experiencing the fantastic V&A Food Market, visiting the aquarium, or the Red Shed Craft workshop there are a host of attractions. There are even seals in the dock who love to show off to the yachts around them, and a Big WheeL to experience.Hungry. There are 40 restaurants to choose from and every type of cuisine imaginable. The Waterfront Village Apartments with their views over the marina are an ideal place to stay. Security is good and they are very well equipped.

With 100s of shops to choose from you will never walk out there without getting the items you needed.If non of the above are your thing you have sunset cruises, helicopter rides, big wheels, fast paced power boats, Aquariums and many more sea activities to choose from. You can also enjoy a movie at Nu-Metro if you feel like being indoors and catching a movie.The location is fantastic as well with having Cape Town's popular long street right down the road so you can enjoy a bit of the club life or you can pop over to Green Point and check out the awesome Cape Town Stadium.You can even catch a taxi to Signal Hill to watch the noon gun go off or walk up the amazing Lions Head to watch the sun go down. It is also a quick trip to the popular Camps Bay main road where you can sip on some cocktails and enjoy the sunset.All in all this place is in the perfect location and has the widest range of activities than any other place in Cape Town. The V&A is a perfect starting point for anyone wanting to experience Cape Town and I would recommend it to anyone without a flinch. There is an abundance of parking as well so if you driving there, you will not get to flustered when looking for a place to park."

The atmosphere is electric with live bands, people dancing and a ferris wheel. If you love people watching, this is the go to place. Other options are the rugby museum and a visit to the famous Shimansky diamond factory. The shopping is also great but for souvenirs, I would stick to Green Market Square where you can bargain and get cheaper prices for the same merchandise. However, if you have a time constraint, this is great one stop shopping. You will also find many crafty places as well as high end stores.There is a huge selection of dining possibilities from sit down nice restaurants to fast food.So much to do and so little time!"

There are numerous good dining establishments in the complex which serve various cuisines including Malay Cape cuisines. Seafood restaurants abound in the complex, and one can have a good choice of where to eat. Shopping will tend to be more expensive that other places in Cape Town.

In my opinion, A&V Waterfront is great if:- You want to retail shop (but shops in US and UK are similar)- Eat great interntional food at quality restaurants - Buy Souvenirs (pricier)- Get cash from ATM- Have time to kill and want to relax in a nice coffee shop or bar- Go for a stroll on the promenande- Find info about HOHO bus as main office is thereIf time is limited, I would give it a miss, and visit other attracts."

They do have security around r waterfront which makes it safe to go at night time as well as during the day. There are some beggars who will not leave you alone if you have food in your hand. One followed us all the way next to the aquarium until we got close to a security and finally he stopped. Other than that, the V&A has great shops and restaurants. Highly reccomnded: Cafe Alfredo for breakfast brunch or lunch and also the Market on the Wharf as well as ferrymans. I would skip Mondiall unless you want to pay for the view because the food was overpriced and not that great. The V&A is also a connecting location for the Robben Island tour. Great great location."

There were shops with clothing, beautiful artwork and countless restaurants with excellent food. There was plenty to do in the daytime and also it was just as beautiful lit up at night. An ampitheatre was there that seats a large number of people to enjoy the music and other entertainment. Bands were playing, people were singing, and dancers were dancing along the way which made it excellent for nightlife. Would love to go back and do it all over again!"

Security is everywhere which gives you a good feeling, but we are on our third night here and we feel secure walking everywhere. Fabulous array of shops, great variety of restaurants including a food court and more upmarket restaurants (even the most expensive ones are very affordable for American and European wallets) and just a R50.00 cab ride away from our hotel. Fortunately the shops are open until 9 p.m. every night so you can grab dinner and still walk off your meal by visiting the nice variety of market stalls, African gift shops as well as upscale clothing shops - everything from a book shop to Guccii here at this waterfront shopping complex. My hubby spotted seals in the harbour earlier today. Also the boats to Robben island go out of here so it has something for everyone. Do take the time to read the 30 historic markers which tell of the history of this working port or take the daily guided walking tour at 11 a.m. which needs to be booked in advance. There is also a large ferris wheel and live music every night. Great place to hang out and tons of great clean rest rooms/toilets everywhere. Taxi's are easy to get at any time of day or night."

I also saw Chopard and Dunhill but nothing else in terms of high end. There are also a range of restaurants from fast food to formal dining.Like all malls, it is an artificial and somehat contrived environment, that bears little relation to the majority of Capetown. One thing to note is that Victoria & Alfred Waterfront seems to take security very seriously. It's like being in an airport and some people may find this a bit weird.In conclusion I don't think that a casual visitor to Capetown would need to leave the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, except for outdoor activities and to visit sites outside the city."

It is also a place to go to in the evening in CT, as the area is totally safe. However if you dont want to spend the evening in a pub or shopping, there is nothing much to do, especially during the winters. There was also a wheel (Cape Town eye) for good views of the city, but again I thought it was disappointing. Overall the waterfront wasnt very exciting."

Very basically, it's a massive shopping mall extending to various split-levels outside and two levels inside. Retailers are varied, from the plethora of restaurants to meet the middle to upper budget pockets to the clothing shops and supermarkets. There are movies, crafts, pubs, fast foods, speciality shops, and even boat cruises and helicopter rides (if you have loads of money!).And of course, the aquarium is well worth visiting, as is the open-air \"theatre\" where planned an what seems to be impromptu shows of dancing and music appear from nowhere, all free to watch, although the performers to request a donation. Please donate if you enjoyed the show.And of course, there's one of those huge frames around a view of Table Mountain into which you can climb to have your photo taken! Or if you don't want the frame, just go to the right of it and voila! The majestic Table Mountain!"

It is nestled below table mountain which you can see when you step out of your apartment and a beautifully clean canal runs right through the middle of the grounds. The apartment itself was very spacious, clean and comfortable with a balcony big enough for sunbathing and enjoying meals. Actually getting into this lovely place was another matter. When we arrived on a very hot Sunday morning we were told we couldn't check in for another 2 hours. We decided to get lunch at the waterfront then head back. However when we arrived back 2 hours later, we had to wait another hour before we were shown to our rooms. Therefore the first day felt like a lot if waiting around in a very small and cramped reception area with not much communication from staff.Despite this setback, our stay at the V & A waterfront was superb."

Shopping experience is great with many choices with a Made in South Africa clothing/jewellry available.

You have to purchase a ticket at the waterfront office which is next to the Aquarium. This then lasts for several journeys on any bus route - we opted for another taxi but I suspect that tickets would be a good option, as there seems to be a service to all the local attractions.For the ladies - if you visit the Mall, check out Woolworths - I thought I was in Debenhams, it's such a grand store!"

It has many ppl around, many options to eat and shop, beautiful views, and here I fell segure (I even walked at night). I ate outside (which was expensive, but had a great view), but I also ate inside the mall and I dont think it was expensive! I need a new booking for the last days of my staying in SA, but I just cant get any not close to here!"

If you do miss some clothes, or want to buy some souvenirs, this is it as well.Of course it is touristy but what else would one expect.Also have a close look if you can see any seals in the harbour if they are there they can get very playful.An importatnt thing though: There are lots of taxis waiting at the exit and a good deal of them are not real taxi drivers. Many have no idea where your destination is and they will try to overcharge you. Anything up to the Kensington is max 60 rand, do not pay more."

Busy, vibrant, salty smell of the ocean, music... just little bit of whats waiting for you there on one nice Cape Town day.People are happily browsing arround, lots of food, drinks, laughter and fun. Youll find many nice restaurants, shops and attractions that are offered to you as you walk. Nice ethnic music mixed with popular songs and styles will chear you up as chaps are really spreading good vibrations. You also have really nice view of the Table Mountain.If you want to buy nice souvenir from South Africa visit African Trading Port shop on Waterfront, youll find something there. Selection is fantasitc and most of the things are hand made localy. Close by you can also find very nice Aquarium thats really worth seeing.Every time i visit Cape Town this is where i spend at least one saturday. I love it!"

It's a charming mix of maritime industry, posh hotels, upscale shops, and even a bit of schlock. It's a great place to stretch your legs after a long flight, enjoy the sunshine, have a glass of wine and people watch. Everyone is incredibly friendly, and the prices are so reasonable that one feels guilty."

Two days ago I was once again in the V&A Waterfront and I didn't really feel like shopping and had to do a bit of catch-up with my daily fitness walk as we have been mainly in shopping centers and different restaurants. My \"exercise\" started at the Breakwater Parking Lot (4 hours @ R 10,00 = 1 USD) it is a little off the centre but the new waterfront parking is now connected to this cheap section and you have a nice walk under cover into the shopping soul. Here find your way out and explore the new restaurants on the top floor via long stairs, up and down. There are lifts and elevators but not for fitness. Find the new shops and buildings on the other side, walk along piers and watch the seals, fisherman boats, yacht and tourist sailers. Use the stairs and find out all attractions and speciality shops of the entire centre. I spend almost for hours \"on the run\", have probably done about 5 km and hundreds of stairs, enjoyed the most amazing views over the V&A and Table Mountain with Cape Town's Skyline in between. Today I feel the tour in my muscles and joints, but instead of spending money I had a glorious \"walk-out\"! We relaxed afterwards in the best fish and sushi place of Cape Town: Willoughby's, rounding off a worthwhile excursion."

I live by the waterfront in the UK, and most of these places have been given over to tourists. I loved the shops, the singing, the crafts and in the blue shed is Township Guitars where I bought my son an oil can guitar. The owner was there and jammed with him, it was wonderful. We stayed in the Victoria and Alfred hotel on the waterfront so it was perfect for us. it was totally safe, the first night I went out on my own as my son slept for 18 hours!!

The atmosphere is very relaxed and variety of cuisine is on offer in numerous restaurants and public houses. We tried Thai, Indian and fish restaurants and all were excellent and not too expensive. Local beers and South African wines are very good. Couple of restaurants had live bands and that added extra ambiance of the placeWe had anxiety of walking after dark but we were reassured by the presence of private security officers who patrolled the complex and let their presence known.

We went several times as our apartment was close by and we didn't even go into a shop once. You visit the Aquarium and The Robben Island Museum and ferry point from there. The food market/hall is fantasmagorical - if you don't try The Fish Box at least 3 times like we did you are missing a culinary treat and bargain. There are so many choices inside that building it will make you salivate. There are dry docks with boats being worked on, there are pleasure boats and helicopter trips you can take if you are feeling brave. There is history all around and there is fun to be had. We ate one early evening at The Harbour House and whilst it wasn't the best meal we ate on our holiday - it was very good and the outside setting was marvellous and the price for 2 large gin and tonics, one mussel starter, one king prawn main one fillet steak main and one lovely bottle of sauvignon blanc was the princely sum of \u00a345. To sum up it is a lively and integral part of Cape Town and shouldn't be missed. Also just a 10 minute walk in the direction of the stadiium but hugging the coast is The Grand Cafe which is great for a chilled out lunch in a posh beach setting. The prices are a little higher but you don't mind for a lovely setting like this."

When we realized that it was essentially a mall along the water we left. There were a lot of souvenir shops between other stores you would find in a normal mall. There are a few street performers as well, so that's entertaining for a bit. The \"crafts\" section is a bunch of booths that sell things you find pretty much everywhere else along the roads in the area except it's three times the cost.If you're looking for souvenirs at a good price, there's a street market at Boulders Beach and an even better one at the entrance of the Cape of Good Hope Park.

We ate at Bukhara which I would say was OK but not great compared to NY or London Indian food.Parking was a bit of a pain but manageable. You can end up walking around and then realize you parked all the way on the other side which can take time getting to. Of course be smart and memorize where you parked. And for some reason, of the 5-6 times we parked, only once did the parking ticket actually work.There is also a spot to view sea lions there."

The locals are found in abundance too. The reason in my opinion this place clicks is because its got many restaurants to cater to different budgets, bars, shopping centre and shops. There are shows that take place throughout the day by the locals performing on the streets at times,very entertaining.The shopping mall has a big choice of products for all kinds along with grocery store, pharmacies, clinics, theatre hall, tourist help center, ATMs. The security in this area is very alert and in abundance thus keeping a control on any bad elements. At the quay side you can see seals and various yachts and sailing boats. Its also easy to book adventure trips from here. Very good for families and others.Price wise I found this area more expensive then other places in Cape Town but its worth spending more and enjoying the comfort and ease of shopping.

There are eateries to cater to those with cash to spend (generally around the mall), but there are cheaper options too - typically fish & chips places.Lots of shopping places in the area. The craft market is a great place for buying local handicrafts - it's not necessarily cheap though."

We ended up visiting three times during our stay, but the mall part of the waterfront was never our destination. Instead, we went twice to the Nelson Mandela Gateway center to catch the ferry (it was cancelled one day because of the weather) and once to shop at the nearby crafts center where we also caught the Red Bus Tour. We did venture inside the mall portion and did some shopping but the prices were high as you might expect. We shopped instead inside the crafts place next to the Red Bus tour stop where there are local merchants selling their goods for a lot less. There are also other things to do at the waterfront besides shopping. You can take a 1 hour harbor tour which we did when our trip to Robben Island was cancelled. It was pretty inexpensive. We also went on the Cape Wheel which is a very large ferris wheel similar to the London Eye. I would recommend either of these activities."

The restaurants are extremely expensive as they cater ONLY for tourists. You will find all the top end designer brands at ridiculous prices however there are a number of mid ranged affordable places to do some shopping. All in All rather drive 20km further north to Canal Walk, a much better Shopping Mall and has a lot more to offer."

Over a lovely local brew at Mitchells Ale House we mixed with the locals who were very welcoming and keen to talk rugby. The banter was good natured and fun. We also enjoyed the live band playing at Ferryman's Original Waterfront Tavern. So many great spots to enjoy. Dinner was equally as enjoyable and our impression was that this is where Cape Town's folk come to just enjoy themselves and relax. What a setting to do so. Make sure you allow yourself a few trips to the V & A Waterfront. You will enjoy every moment."

Stunning!The room was aprox thirty foot long and in superb condition the bathroom was also hue with a massive bath.

There is a great variety of restaurants to suit most budgets. A must to stay near here if visiting Cape Town, as you can daily get to all the main tourist attractions from here."

Take a walk around and you will find the maritime museum, the clock Tower, and it is from here that you can take the boat to Robben Island. If the weather is not great go to the aquarium, and there is a great archeological museum just under the Nedbank head office. Also have a look at the business school which is located in a converted prison, which also has a restaurant at pretty decent prices. If you want to try another waterfront in Cpae Town, try the Royal Cape Yachting Club, be nice and they will let you in as a guest. The V&A has all sorts of restaurants at different prices, and a great supermarket where you can buy a sandwich at the going Cape Town price and enjoy the V&A waterfront vibe. "

There's no doubt you need to come here when visiting Cape Town.It's more expensive than anywhere else in terms of the restaurants and bars and shops.Basically a working harbour with a collection of malls and all the usual KFC, McDonalds as well as upmarket restaurants.There is a nice farmers market bit where you can taste the lovely food, I liked this bit.A lot of souvenir shops and this is where you catch the ferry to Robben Island.It's always very busy amd bustling with buskers and singers.We only came once during our 12 day stay in Cape Town.Very touristy and they are cashing in on that with their prices. Also the taxi we got back to our hotel from the Waterfront 'forgot' to put the meter on so we gave him half the fare he was about to rip us off for.Overall I liked the fact I've seen it but wouldn't rave about it and i wouldn't stay here either. I believe the city centre has more to offer."

And if maybe there is a specific restaurant you want to go to. But tourists are everywhere an they gauge you in prices for knick knacks. And high prices for food. And the food lovers market.

The mall is home to a wide range of shops. Here you'll find international brands, designer items and some local souvenirs as well.There are so many great places to have a bite to eat or enjoy a drink while taking in the view of Table Mountain and the harbour. My favourite thing to do is to get some Marcell's Frozen Yoghurt and stroll through the Waterfront. There's also a lot of history at the Waterfront. If you like history, visit the University of Cape Town's Business School. The Breakwater Lodge used to be a prison and you can still see etchings into one of the outside walls made by prisoners. Besides the history, you can also visit the Two Oceans Aquarium. It's a great option if you're looking for something to keep the kids entertained...although as an adult I love visiting it too.I was however very disappointed in the area near the Clocktower. What used to be vibrant and an incredibly busy space, especially as the weekend approached, now looks like 'no man's land'. The small mall area there is almost deserted,. There's a Moyo Restaurant (there seems to be one around every corner these days), but they've constructed these hideous stalls where you can buy snacks from and it just doesn't add anything to the area. I was very disappointed in that regards. But generally, the V&A is a great place to stop for a few hours while visiting Cape Town."

Your own little world within a world buzzing with activity, colour, sounds and smells and never a dull moment. Everyone is happy. Everyone is helpful. And the Waterfront encapsulates all that is great about this great city. Street musicians pound on their drums, sing and improvise. You can spend as little or as much as you want on a meal. A multitude of cruises whisk you to all manner of sights. Helicopter rides, Ferris wheel, exclusive jewelry shops to dream in, amazing souvenirs, seals basking on the jetties... a real melting pot of all that is fine in life.The whole area is quite expansive but easily traversed on foot. Honestly, when you visit here it with some difficulty you eventually have to drag yourself away. Cannot possibly be done in a day so lash out and spend several. You will not be disappointed."

There were also African Bands performing, and one could stop, watch and listen to them for as long as one liked!There is also an African \"Gallery\" which sells all kinds of crafts, things that are made around the Cape Town Area, pictures, necklaces carvings etc. There were also the usual fortune telling rooms, and healers who offered their services at a price. My South African carer told us( Mum, Dad and me) that the vendors expect one to bargain, and if one accepts the first price they offer, they feel insulted! Unfortunately, bargaining is not a skill the English are accustomed to!We finished off the afternoon by going to the open air restrurant on the Waterfront in which we had Castle's Beer, with views overlooking Table Mountain. We had to be careful.because even in the summer, it can get very breezy in Cape Town, particularly in the evening, and my carer's glass of Castle blew over and soaked my trousers! Never mind, they soon dried!The restrurant also sells Snook, which is an extremely popular fish in Cape Town. One could also if one wanted eat Springbok, Kudu, Ostrich and Warthog. Snook apparently, was available in WW2 in Britain, but rapidly become unavailable when the war ended."

Are you looking for adrenalin this is where you easy can book a speedboat adventure, a helicopter ride or a tandem paragliding flights. Don\u00b4t miss the fantastic Two Ocean Aquarium well worth a visit. Just outside the aquarium you find the main bus stop for City Sightseeing Hop on Hop Off buses - great sightseeing with guided tours in many languages via earphones included in the price. Take the bus to get to Table Mountain cableway, lyxury Mount Nelson Hotel where the afternoon tea is something extra not to miss, fantastic Kirstenbosch Gardens with all it\u00b4s flowers, Cape Town\u00b4s most luxury beach Camps Bay and you can also easy change to antother bus with a wine tour.If you want to buy a really nice souvenir you can have a lot of fun with like a djembe drum, I really recommend a visit to Waterfront Craft Market and the djembe shop on the ground level. The store is owned by Aisha Diop and her brother. I bought a djembe drum from them and got both a great price and outstanding service. They shipped the drum to Sweden and I was a little bit worried since I havn\u00b4t got the drum within a month. Aisha answered my e-mails with my concern, she visited the post office to track the drum and followed up by e-mail until I got the drum. Since it was shipped by boat it took about two months to arrive, but well worth the wait since it\u00b4s a proffessional drum with excellent quality - so no worries if you shop by Aisha if you need help with shipping abroad!"

There are a number of shopping areas, a craft building and seemingly hundreds of places to eat and drink, from upscale, to fast food--there is even a McDonald's. For a novice, trying to find a specific store or restaurant can be daunting--there are kiosks that digitally show directions, but you can easily get lost inside some of those buildings..

I have visited waterfront attractions in several countries around the world and have not really found anything comparable. There is a huge variety of different cuisines represented at the V&A Waterfront. We loved the Two Oceans Aquarium. I always enjoy walking through the craft markets and browsing to see what's new. There are great views of the mountain and bay from the main mall. We enjoyed watching the different shows and/or acts on and around the amphitheater. A few years back we played putt-putt in the caves. We didn't have the time this time around to see if they were still in existence. In season there is always something to do in the waterfront. There is a parking fee for those that are driving."

I have spent a lot of time visiting the waterfront in the last few months and before you read the rest of my review, please note that the waterfront is VERY SAFE with lots of security guards patrolling the place.However, being a huge tourist attraction, I think that it is very important to stress that con-artists and lately, I've noticed a con-artist-turned- pickpocket operating in the area. More specifically, ON TWO OCCASIONS, a very well-spoken brown-skinned woman with long curly/permed hair has approached us in the car park with a story about how she needs R100 for petrol or that her keys are locked in her car and she needs money... Tonight, the very same woman, carrying a child, tried to pickpocket my girlfriend by bumping into her from behind. Only once we noticed what she was up to, was she no where to be seen. My advice is to enjoy the waterfront but be careful (NOT PARANOID) about strange people that may come up to you. Be careful in the car park as well as near the entrance of the building. Otherwise, have fun and enjoy the wonderful restaurants, views and street performances that take place!"

Actually the curios here are among the best in South Africa. I didn't know that at the time, but after 3 weeks in SA I can definately say so. The Blue Shed Craft Market also houses alternative treatments etc, so if you want a massage or a tarot card reading this is the place. The Waterfront is also heavy with security, so feeling very safe, though you should still be cautious not ending up at the far edges (like the aquarium) alone after darkness."

We did go shopping here and found some good buys but I also cautionon that, the prices on some items were much higher than you would get in other parts of town. Everytime we went they had perfomers on both ends of the street singing and dancing which was great. We had a friend buy a tanzanite ring at the jewlery store and a few other things.

I should add there that South Africa has some of the largest and most amazing shopping malls I have every seen and that is saying something considering I come from the United States. Returning to the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, like many other cities with aging port facilities, Cape Town redeveloped its port, or at least the older portions, into a shopping and entertainment district. The result is a first class entertainment and shopping area, complete with hotels and a world class shopping mall which is open late at night and safe for all concerned. I know it sounds like a something for tourists but believe me that is not the case. Locals both white and black shop and eat there. I suspect it has helped to kill the central business district of Cape Town but again this is not unique to South Africa. Tourists and locals alike like safe and entertaining area in which to shop and enjoy themselves. I should add you also get really good view of Table Top Mountain from the V&A. Enjoy it. We did."

You can find amazing cosmopolitan designer stores and the more basic retail ones and everything in between. Even if you don't have much money to spend, you can take in the wonderful views of Table Mountain, and the harbor area. Nestled right on the water, a boat trip or helicopter flip is well worth it although a little pricey. You could spend a whole day here and not see everything! A good excuse to make another visit. Parking is available at a fair price and many tours depart from the waterfront year-round."

It's best to pace yourself by breaking up your shopping to stop for a meal, a beer at one of the numerous bars, a wine tasting at Carolines Fine Wine Cellar, a massage, or just laze in the sun for a half hour or so outside of people-watching. While the shops are not necessarily the least expensive in Capetown you will find such a variety of stores and products no shopping experience there will leave you disappointed. There is plenty of parking in the numerous carparks around the shopping centre and you are very close to many other experiences such as dining at numerous excellent restaurants. Well worth doing."

There are also a large selection of restaurants from very luxurious to relatively inexpensive, featuring everything from local Cape cuisine to Italian, Indian, seafood, and more.

The views are amazing and it seems like you see table mountain at every turn. We spent a few days here buying presents, going to the cinema, catching a boat to robben island and visting as many restaurants as we could from greek to italian to wonderful seafood. A real must if you visit Cape Town and is always at the top of our list."

I had looked at the machine before in a smaller mall that had it at the back of a chain store and got no advise on how it worked.The views around the mall are spectacular.

The last ferry from there departs at 6:00 PM and the island is deserted after that. Online prior ticket purchase for a designated time slot is the best option for the Robben Island trip."

You will be able to see seals swimming around and if you are lucky enough you may even spot dolphins in the harbour, its great.

Of course, it's also the wharf where you embark for Robben island, the World Heritage Site dedicated to Nelson Mandela and his fellow prisoners who spent decades imprisoned for their efforts to end apartheid. From the boat, the views of Table Mountain and the sea side of the city set against a miraculously blue sky are breathtaking. Our camera was clicking constantly. This is an all day event or more if you want to really shop in all the places which sell South African goods from the outrageously chic to good value locally made crafts, clothing and jewelry. Tickets for Robben island need to be purchased a couple of days in advance. The waterfront is also where you get the local double decker bus which takes you all around Capetown (the city with a mountain in the middle) for more days of incredible Cape Town sightseeing."

On the other hand there are soma amazing artists exhibiting in there which are well worth a perusal."

You obviously have to come here as a tourist/visitor to Cape Town, not least because some of the attractions like the open top bus and the ferry to Robben Island leave from here. But it's not really a particularly special place. It has a rather sterile feel, and you could be almost anywhere in the Western world, except perhaps when you glimpse Table Mountain and are reminded where you are. Fundamentally, it's a rather artificial place.There are lots of restaurants, but we never had a particularly special meal here. you certainly pay special prices, though - everything here will cost more, sometimes significantly more. The exception is parking, which is very reasonable. It depends what you are looking for, really. If you want to stay in a safe tourist bubble then maybe this is the place for you. I would suggest staying outside it (the hotels here are very expensive) and popping in and out when you need to or feel like it. See a bit of the real Cape Town as well. But it's ok to wander around, it just didn't feel all that South African."

This area has it all, striking beauty, mesmerizing view of Table Mountain, vibrant tourism scene, amazing histoical roots, a modern makeover, entertainment and street performances, lovely local, a mosaic of cultures and races from all over the world, insanely number of shops restaurants and some museums. It is the place to be, and I highly recommend finding a hotel or a furnished apartment in there, which won't necessarily break one's budget. It is the embankment point for all your sightseeing adventures throughout the city and the Western Cape. From there you can go for the ferry ride to Robben Island, spend a few hours in the Two Oceans Aquarium, or may be book a diving with Sharks adventure if you feel crazy. Many restaurants in and around the area and the new Stadium is not far away. It's also a very safe area for tourists with around the clock police and safety guards circling the area. I left the cinema once or twice fairly late at night with the wife and walked for 10 min to my apartment without ever feeling unsafe.It is a place that I only have great things to say about, and since I have been there once, I doubt that I would ever stay anywhere else in the city if I ever got the chance to visit the amazing city once again."

It turned out to be a most pleasant experience. We watched a variety of street performances... some quite good. Singers, small instrumental groups, acrobats and the like. Opportunities abound to sit on a terrace and have a drink, eat a meal, watch the huge variety of small or large boats move through the harbor, \"seal\" watch or shop until you drop. People are friendly and there really is something for everyone."

Maybe it is the most exciting and beautiful shopping mall complex in the world and it has its uses for tourists - contained, safe, easy, accessbile etc However if cape town isn't quite south africa as many claim, the V&A isn't Cape Town exactly either. It's well patrolled to keep aybody deemed undesirable out. Prices are significantly higher than elsewhere. Just as an illustrative example - at the Garden Centre you can get a digitalphoto print for about R3, at Canal Walk R2.50, at the V&A you'll pay R4-R5. It's a sort of \"Disneyland\" for tourists.

If you go nowhere else then you will have the opportunity to purchase everything you may need but at a distinct tourist cost.Contrary to what some will tell you, Cape Town is not a dangerous city. If you apply the same common sense that you would at home then it is just as safe. Yes, there are townships that you would be foolish to try to explore but the City has other wonderful things to see and do. Shopping is cheaper away from the Waterfront and you can actually see the difference between the rather false cruise line ambience and the real Cape Town.Whilst all of the shops, restaurants and trips are concentrated in a single place, there is a whole city there to explore. We liked the facilities but did prefer to strike out on our own and get the real experience."

The vast warehouse formerly full of interesting shopping is now full of cheap junk. There are many nice jewelry stores with appropriately high prices.Here are the pluses:- lovely view of table mountain- interesting eateriesMinuses:- not the place it was 2 years ago- very crowded- we were intimidated for money by a security guard- we took a sailing trip on a catamaran but were overwhelmed by a huge  crowd of noisy children, most of whom threw up on the deck.- the boat trip to Robben Island was a disappointment as it was very crowded, and with continuous loud singing by other trippers.

It's very relaxed, and sitting outside the mall watching the big screen or just enjoying some lunch was extremely nice. The mall too is VERY big and good for all kinds of shopping, and of course it contains two cinemas as well. My only warning would be not to go on the weekend! It gets so terribly crowded, especially outside in front of the mall. A week day morning is much nicer to enjoy the buildings, shops and sights arounf the waterfront."

There are 2 craft markets, the Blue Shed and the Red Shed, where you can see crafters at work; there is an aquarium, various boat trips, cinemas and a small amphitheatre where you will always find entertainers, as well as at other strategic spots around the Waterfront. Scratch Patch, where you can sift through thousands of semi-precious stones is popular with adults and kids. The Waterfront always has a great vibe!"

We visited on our first day in Cape Town and it was not immediately apparent but as time went on and we visited other places we realised the prices of merchandise in the waterfront shops was generally pretty reasonable."

The shower door was half broken, the decor feels a bit late 1990s. The staff were great, and the location for dining at night perfect.

Caveat: We liked the V&A waterfront, it does have a lot to offer, see, taste and photograph but its area is quite small and much there is expensive and overpriced. The setting below Table Mountain makes this place iconic and world-class. However, its smaller than you'd expect, crowded with little (expensive) shops and restaurants (very expensive - not very good food). But there is still some good to be had there. Pros: The photos of table mountain you can take here are amazing. The local craft market halls are nice to see and a good place to spend some money as many of the artists and sellers deal in local goods, arts and crafts. The Two Oceans Aquarium is a very nice (pricey) stop. The Ocean Basket restaurant is the same price as their other branches and affords excellent views as well, making it the best choice there, value for money. Cons: Many expensive shops but ok as you don't have to buy anything. The restuarants are surprisingly poor but charge very high fees. Anywhere else in the world, they would go out of business quickly but they seem to survive on the V&A Waterfront. I had a expensive yet poor meal in 2004 and repeated that mistake during our recent trip. We ate at the Ocean Basket for our second meal, much cheaper and actually quite a good meal of calamari and sole. Thus, we highly recommend giving your business to them over the more posh sit-down restos overlooking the marina and mountain. They are clearly selling you the mountain view, not a great meal! Another problem with the V&A Waterfront is that you expect to be amazed when you visit here. Unfortunately, its just nice not amazing so you can easily feel a bit disappointed. Keep your expectations in check and you can enjoy your visit to the V&A."

The area is very pretty, with some lovely views out to see and back to Table Mountain, however that is where the enjoyment really stops. The area is extremely built up now. Thousands and thousands of apartments and lots of large brand name hotels. The area is dominated by a large shopping centre, with many shops which you could see anywhere around the world. Not many of them are unique to Cape Town or South Africa. Prices are crazy when compared to normal South African prices. The restaurants again are dominated by large chain names at prices which want to make you cry. I don\u2019t really consider this area to give you much of an insight into South Africa or Cape Town, you could be in any shopping area in the UK or the US. Personally I believe that if you want to experience \u2018true\u2019 South Africa, then you are must better off eating at some local restaurants, away from the Waterfront (which will be a \u00bc of the price) and definitely finding a hotel away from the area as well.It\u2019s one of those places which you have to go and see if you are in the area, just to be able to say you have been there. However I always leave with the overwhelming feeling, that I am so glad that I am not staying here!"

Being a major tourist attraction, it is also very safe, easily accessible, and mostly affordable.Cons: Well, being a major tourist attraction it is also, how shall we say, very \"touristy.\" Imagine Pier 39 in San Francisco without the sea lions yelping in the background and you pretty much have this place. At first (and second and maybe third) glance it seems rather superficial, but again this is somewhat to be expected. You have to travel a bit more \"inland\" to find a more authentic experience."

The mountain view was spectacular. The hotel would do well to market not only the view of the mountain but the view of the harbor as well. Each morning, we awoke to views of seals sunning themselves on the dock below. Watching the seals play and the boats coming in and out of the harbor just added to a terrific experience.The only negative with regard to the hotel itself is that it is located in a major tourist area. Restaurants and bars abound close by, including the very noisy Green Dolphin located on the ground floor of the hotel\u2019s building. We had already heard of noise complaints for rooms on the opposite side of the hotel but had not heard of these problems in the mountain view rooms. Our room shared a wall with the Green Dolphin and the music, drumbeats, etc. floated right into the room. To the hotel\u2019s credit, when we called to complain about 11:30 one evening, the hotel\u2019s guest services department said they would call to put a stop to it immediately. Within two minutes, music at the bar had been shut down (apparently the hotel has an agreement with the bar to end music around 11PM).The noise issue was not a major bother for us, but I would hesitate to recommend the hotel to those who go to bed early. Again, it is not a major concern, but one that should be considered for guests willing and able to afford a property of this caliber."

And we thank our South African travel agent in CapeTown - Rufaro - for selecting the place and guiding us to it. In comparison, Jo-berg is a slum!BG KoshyBangaloreIndia"

If that's what you're into you'll love it, but if you're looking for something at all authentic, it will simply waste your time. Personally I hated it, but if you want a big open-air mall sort of experience, the setting is pretty and the shops upmarket."
