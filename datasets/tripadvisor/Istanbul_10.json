Under a deep blue sky, surrounded by children running in the grass, dogs sleepily resting in the shade of palm trees and happy picnicking families, this place makes you thankful to be alive."

It was more Turks than foreign visitors too. Rubbish left strewn about from picnics making the place look unkempt - it was a sorry sight. It was busier because of Eid and maybe some bins have been removed after recent events in the square, but there should be more signs to tell people to take their rubbish with them or impose a fine if caught!"

The area is full of hotels (for every budget), restaurants, bakeries. If you have time plan at least two full days to cover the important bits.

Avoid the cafes and juice shops in the square, prices are an absurd rip off.

Lots of eateries and hotels right there. Very popular with locals and tourists alike. A grand stage was set up to celebrate Ramadan and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a hub of this wonderful city."

The trace is still there although now it is full of tourists. It's always good to know the history of Constantinople first before visiting the square :-) and I will keep visiting the site because there will be always new history or Archeological knowledge found in this area."

It is not expensive to go in, but the cafe inside is quite pricey so maybe take your own drink/juice. They will not take you more than an hour or so to explore.

There is a handy light rail (trolley) that runs around the Pennisula with a station next to the Square. Within a few blocks are the Topkapi Museum (among others), innumerable boutique hotels and restaurants, and within walking distance are the Grand Bazaar (though the trolley also goes there), and a moderate distance walk down the hill the Suleymaniye Mosque, the Spice Markets, the Galata Bridge , the Golden Horn waterway and more shops and markets and mosques beyond counting. Arranging to stay at one of the boutique hotels within a few blocks of the Square leaves you ideally placed for touring the historic sections of Istanbul. The hotels do vary considerably so don't trust to blind luck- look up reviews before you pick one."

The Basilica Cistern (TL 15) is a mere 40m walk from the square and the Grand Bazaar is within walking distance too.It is very large and has numerous benches scattered around which are convenient for taking a break from seeing the sites or for grabbing a quick bite from one of the food carts to be found on the square. We travelled in winter and various breads; corn and roasted chestnuts were on offer.As the square is open to the elements and provides very little cover, i would recommend carrying an umbrella or raincoat if rain is predicted.Apart from the attractions mentioned, there are ATM's; an outdoor cafe; a permanent kiosk offering various snacks, drinks and reading material; a large fountain; bicycle parking areas and many curio stores selling various wares. Lots of trendy cafe's and restaurants may be found in the immediate surrounds too.The square is also home to a large number of street cats and dogs who were friendly and kept to themselves.Public transport to Sultanhamet is via the metro tram (dark blue line) or the hop-on hop-off bus."

The attractions you may visit within walking distance are Ayasofia, the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cisterna and the Top Kapi palace if you are willing to walk an extra 5 minutes in order to avoid the hassle of the tram. The square itself is a very busy place with locals and tourists from all over the world mingling in a very Istanbul-like crowd!"

It holds four monuments -- Serpent Column, Theodosius Obelisk, Masonry Obelisk and the German Fountain. As a history buff, I enjoyed walking along the paved square and reading the information sign by each monument, Details appear in three languages, including English. Two sides of the square hold a few grassy areas, each enclosed by low, white metal fences. Lamp posts and benches stand nearby. I sat for a while and watched the few people, who were visiting the square on a weekday morning, stroll by. It was quite pleasant to rest here, away from the crowds at Sultanahmet Park."

It is probably easier to make this district your base for sight-seeing as there are so much to see. The district of Sultanahmet (sool-tahn-ah-MEHT, named for Sultan Ahmet I, builder of the Blue Mosque) has many restaurants as well as hotels with excellent prices. Two obelisks facing one another are still to be seen in Sultanahmet square. One of these, is the Walled Obelisk at the rear part of Sultanahmet Square which was set up by Constantine VII. and the other the Obelisk of Thutmose III."

The huge Sultan Ahmet Square provides you enjoyment of discovery historical and cultural treasure from Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman era. If you have limited time, make your sightseeing priorities and make every minute worthy of your visit.HOW TO GET TO THIS SQUAREIt is easy accessible by tram line T1 or metro line Zeytinburn-Kabata\u0161 /get off at Sultan Ahmet sq. stop/. A more beautiful option is drive by tourist buses get on&get off. They have stop in front of Blue mosque.WHAT TO SEE- The major attractions represent: Blue mosque or Sultan Ahmet mosque, Haghia Sophia, Topkapi palace and Basilica Cistern. These sights are located within walking distance. Only problem could be lines in front of these sights. Let say, only visit to Topkapi palace involves four hours at least. Also, lines plus visit to each of mentioned attractions involve half day. - Two beautifully decorated fountains are worthy of your admiration. The first one is the Fountain of Ahmet III in rococo style with adorable tiles and valuable inscription in front of the Topkapi palace. The second one is the Fountain of Emperor Wilhelm II with polished granite columns and golden mosaic dome in front of Blue mosque.- Take a walk along the narrow and windy streets of this area. It is really a beautiful experience. I came across the charming traditional Turkish houses beautifully painted in blue, green, red color. Don't miss Sogukcesme street, that runs parallel to the the walls of Topkapi palace and you will find the wooden houses, typical examples of Ottoman architecture. HAVE A BREAKThere ate street's stands offering freshly made natural juices. If you prefer to have a break at table, don't miss the rooftop cafes and restaurants. You will be rewarded with an amazing view.PAY ATTENTION TO:Be patient in case of long lines in front of attractions. Bring with yourself the city map in any case.Although, Istanbul is a Mediterranean city, it could be cold, rainy and even snowy weather during winter, so put on yourself the warm clothes / don't forget umbrella, cap, scarf and gloves/.And enjoy this meeting point of Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman era."

For about 20 centuries, the social life of Bysantium., later Constantinople, and now Istanbul focused here. During the Byzantine period, Political discussions were often made at the Hippodrome, which could be directly accessed by the Emperor through a passage that connected the Kathisma (Emperor's Loge at the eastern tribune) with the Great Palace of Constantinople. During the Fourth Crusade in 1204, Hippodrome was ruined like most other remarkable places, and the four horses (Quadriga) that stood here were looted and brought to Venice to be installed on the fa\u00e7ade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice.This place witnessed not only the Nika Riots in AD 532, but also the killing of some Byzantine Emperors, Ottoman Sultans, and also the end of one of the most famous armies (The Janissaries). They rioted multiple times on this square, killed at least in sultan, and finally killed in 1826 after a riot. The first palace of the sultans in Istanbul (Topkap\u0131) is near the place, same is true for the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet) which gives the square the current name.To my youth, this place was the favourite location for public hangings. Next to it was the jail for the convicts (now a luxury hotel). Later, the hippies took over, and the \"Pudding Shop\" was populated by beatniks and, later on, hippies and other travelers on overland route between Europe and India, Nepal, and elsewhere in Asia - the \"hippie trail\" to Afghanistan and Goa. Even President Clinton ate here.Some of the hippies still populate the area, but it is not easy to detect them because the population density of the square is that high that at times it is not easy to walk. Never take a taxi to here, only the tram."

A large part of the population was strictly observing the holy month of Ramadan but as tourists we did not feel at all restricted or inconvenienced. We were charmed to experience the spirit of solidarity & community displayed during fast-breaking at Sultanahmet Square where the whole city seemed to have congregated in a general air of festivity. Istanbul is a beautiful & well organised city. The mix of Asian & European cultures is seamless & evident in the landscape as well as the people. We stayed at a local hotel close to the Sultanahmet Square, which though was a more 'budget' experience than we had bargained for, turned out to be a great decision due to being within walking proximity to so many of the city's best attractions around the Square. We were thus able to allocate the organised tours to the far-off sites such as the palaces & Bosphorous while we made full use of walking & the tram system to explore the old city on our own. We found the tram-metro link to be very economical & tourist friendly. It is handy to know the timings of the various attractions in advance as not all sites are open on all days. The locals were truly hospitable & very cosmopolitan in their approach. Vendors at the Grand Bazaar can be very aggressive though so if not wanting to buy anything this place could be avoided. Everyone suggests trying the seafood restaurants either in the old city or under the Bosphorous bridge, but both were big disappointments for us. The food consisted mainly of cold salads & boiled/steamed fish which were priced too high. The restaurant staff are extremely aggressive to the point of downright rudeness in trying to attract customers into their joint, but most serve exactly the same menu items. They often also promise discounts or freebies to lure one in but by the time the meal is completed the promises are mostly forgotten. This was the biggest turn-off in our entire trip, and honestly the best meal we had was at a very modest eatery patronized only by locals hidden in a back-street, of various meats being grilled on a large open fire. This is a city we could easily return to any day for a second visit."

It is covered around its sides with mosaic pictures, which add to it's beauty.I was so pleased I got back there in the evening, as the fountain lights up and changes colour too, which is lovely to watch.Despite it being very central to a number of attractions, and having a fair amount of people, it never felt crowded, and you could feel really peaceful here.I liked the stray dogs wandering around, although it may not be to everyone's taste - there are only a few regulars, and you can see that they are tagged - the authorities catch them, vaccinate and neuter them, put a tag for tracking into their ear, then release them at the same spot. Volunteers feed the city's animals on certain corners so they don't go hungry and restaurants often feed their leftovers to the animals, but there is no mess.The square is very clean and tidy, and the gardens well kept."

It is around this Square that the most prominent and iconic heritage of the Ottoman Empire could be found and the most busiest location as most tourist buses and Hop On Hop Off bus will begin and terminate their travel from this Square. Around the Square and slightly away we can find the most important historical places to visit as follows:[1] The Blue Mosque standing majestically with 6 minarets [only the Blue Mosque has 6 minarets] whereas others may have four, two or even one to represent the importance and status of the mosque in the community,The Blue Mosque is an operational Mosque and open daily from morning to evening except during prayer times. On Friday it is open from 2 pm onwardsand close prior to that to give way to Friday prayer in the afternoon.[2] Aya Sofia or Haghia Sophia - one of the top destination in Istanbul. It was once a Church during the Byzantine era and when the Ottoman conquered Istanbul or Constantinople at that time, the Church was converted into a Mosque. It was later in this Century that Haghia Sophia was converted into a Museum for everyone to have a look. Some of the original paintings on the wall are still visible as the Ottoman did not destroy them, instead covered it with plaster,[3] Basilica Cistern - A water reservoir to serve the water need of Istanbul built during the Roman Empire. The place has been renovated several times and a walking platform has been built to make it more convinient for visitors to walk and enjoy the magnificient heritage,[4] Museum Topkapi. This is the most crowded place and a major attraction. The Museum was once a Palace where the Ottoman Empire was administered for several hundred years. Amongst the most famous items to see are the big diamond and paraphernalia used by Prophet Muhammad SAW [peace upon him] and several other caliphates. One has to queu for hours just to get a glimpse of some of the artifacts. It will need at a day or two to cover meaningful artifacts.[5] Next to the Square we can also find Arista Bazaar, a much orderly bazaar in comparison to the Grand Bazaar and easier to shop with less bargaining done.In the centre of the Square there is water fountain and from this point tourists mostly take photographs with the background of either The Blue Mosque or Haghia Sophia. There are other monuments sucha s pillar standing tall brought from Egypt and a structure donated from the Kaiser of Germany to commemorate the friendship of Germany and Turkey.Sultanahmet Square is the most lively Square day and night as it remains the centre point for all activities related to the heritage of the Ottoman Empire and a place which cannot be missed by any tourist visiting Istanbul and Turkey.Saharudin & MariamVisiting September 2015Reporting 06.10.2015"

It is a very busy area but easily accessible by the cities tram system or even on foot....it joins onto laneways filled with eateries & small shops & is also a major stop on the hop-on-off bus tour....try to get there early if you want to attempt to avoid the enormous queues that form at these attractions later in the day. Word to the wise though...beware of the carpet salesmen that haunt this area...be polite but firm with them but do expect to be approached if you look even vaguely touristy!"

From here you have access to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi and the Hippodrome. The local tram comes to Sultanahmet from the other side of the Galata bridge, tram number 1 and so this makes it accessible for cruise passengers who want to do their own thing. The Hippodrome is worth a visit as it could have been the inspiration for the chariot race in the film Ben Hur. It is an elongated open area with obolesisks along its axis. There are interpretive boards in English and other languages located at its main features. It is worth stopping there on your way to the Blue Mosque or Hagia Sophia. The Topkapi is slightly further from the Square but is still accessible for most people with average walking ability."

She found Hagia Sophia to be very beautiful and well worth a visit. The shop prices are slightly lower than elsewhere because it is a museum shop. I did my best shopping in the area around the square. I found fabulous little gift shops, well stocked and with prices on everything - good prices! My favourite: Hippodrome 111. Oh what a boon, after being subjected to the shops around our hotel where nothing was priced and we were accosted with smiles and apple tea and then treated so rudely when we chose not to buy! You can have fun shopping in Istanbul but you can get quickly fleeced too if you don't know your product and your prices."

You will need 2 full days on your feet , trust me! Don\u2019t use any transportation between those attractions! You don\u2019t need them!!!1. Start with Sultan Ahmet Bazar. Expensive, but higher quality items to buy with some old style coffee shops and restaurants ..... 2. Then WALK towards the Blue Mosque ( Sultan Ahmat Mosque)... make sure not to go during prayers time....3. Then WALK to Hagia Sophia Museum,4. From there walk again towards TOPKAPI palace..... 5. From TOPKAPI palace you can walk to Basilica Cistern / just across the street..... it's the yellow building on the other corner!.... 6. From there you can walk for half a mile or so towards grand bazar 7. Then it's up to you to go from there down towards Spices bazar through Mahmoud basa street ( one of the most crowded and cheapest streets in Istanbul ) Never go with tourists groups , otherwise your time will be wasted waiting and waiting. discover it yourself, on your feet!..... grab you selfie and enjoy discovering this part of the city....TIP: Don't trust anybody offering you any kind of service in this part of the city\u2026.. you don\u2019t need any help\u2026"

Especially at dusk/night or early morning. I experienced both.I took the train/subway to the tram to the Sultanahmet stop from Ataturk Airport (It took 40-45 minutes, but I would allow an hour. And remember to buy two tokens or 4 for a round trip). I arrived just at about sunset. The first thing you see off the tram is the Blue Mosque straight in front of you. You think you've died and gone to heaven until walk forward a few steps and notice Hagia Sophia off to your left. And then you know you're in heaven. It's breathtaking.As dusk descended and the lights on the mosques and the dancing fountain took over, it went from photographers dream to photographers nirvana. It's lit up better than Epcot only. . . . . IT'S REAL!!!Of course I went into the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia the next morning (all this on a 21 hour lay-over for my flight. . . buy a visa online before you go.), but if I had just made it to the Square and then had to go home, I would have been very satisfied."

The train from the airport was crowded but fairly straightforward and the locals were plenty helpful.The square itself is a public area, free of charge. There are flocks of pigeons fluttering around, beautiful strange and very old trees, and plenty of interesting landmarks; The Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, and Obelisk are only some, to name. It is a mix of European and Arab and a non-miss. The whole thing is a photo opportunity. If you have time, I highly recommend having a traditional Turkish meal, but watch it! It can get pricey in that area. If you visit in winter, bring your gloves and jacket!! I left mine in the airport and nearly froze."

However, if you are just talking about the artistic side, then the tiles, calligraphy, inlaid wood work, mimbar, chairs - the masjid is grand.There is a good bazar - Arasta bazar with blue mosque, the shop keepers are extremely decent, not pushy and tries to help instead of being imposing and nosy!"

Staying so close to this square was worth it. This square pretty much has all the historic sites in Istanbul. Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Basilica Cistern, Hippodrome and Arasta Bazaar. During the evenings we just hung out on many benches in the square to just soak it all in. The closest tram station is Sultanahment station which is served by T1 line. Blue Mosque is less than 3 mins walk from the station."

You haven't seen anything if you haven't been here. Not lots to do but one can sit around the grounds and admire the structures. The evenings give a better perspective with the lighting and all. At times there's even the night time light & sound show which takes you on a brief history tour. In the background is the Arasta Bazaar, not to be mistaken with the Grand Bazaar. On the other side of the tram tracks are loads and loads of restaurants offering mostly the same kind of food. You also find fastfood around."
