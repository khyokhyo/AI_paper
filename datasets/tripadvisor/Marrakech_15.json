Though the rooms seem a bit stark now, it must have been a lovely place to live. The walls and ceilings are covered with intricate carvings, geometric tile-work, plaster stuccowork and murals - all really attractive to the eye. Definitely worth the 20DHM entrance fee for an hour's quiet wander around the corridors, rooms and hallways of this place."

I wanted to take my boyfriend to visit it as unlike me he'd not been to Fes - and I was really pleased to find that this example was equally interesting to visit. It has all the expected features, with beautiful tiling, stucco and woodwork, and in addition visitors are able to roam about in the rooms which were the dormitories, which makes for a really interesting experience. Definitely worth the 20 Dirham entrance fee."

Easy to find, only a short walk from the Marrakech Museum, the Madrasa provides an insight into the lives of the young men who would have studied her over the years. The mainly windowless rooms remind you of the hardship of such commitment but the overall visit to the building is memorable."

The main courtyard is impressive. But that is where it ends. All other rooms are almost identical, empty, plain, dull, former bed rooms or classrooms. Hard to tell the difference, there is nothing in them.If that was all it would be fine (as it is cheap). But what is shocking is a number of people posing as tour guides but are in fact scammers. One guy would say he would offer a tour for 15dhs. Seems ok. He shows you around for 10 mins and then says it's over and at which point (in an empty room or corridor) starts to tell you about his three children, his poor family etc and tries to extort money out of you. It's quite shocking. I'm a man so I basically pushed past him (he follows). I'd imagine a lot of people would be intimidated by this. I saw his next customer was a woman and I warned her (cue more threats).What surprised me is this is the top rated museum in Marrakech and this happens in the open. Where is the staff or security?Be warned - do not hire any guide in there unless they have a badge (none seem to)."

Also worth a look if you're in the area."

Just when you start getting a bit blinded by all the architecture that Marrakech has to offer, the Ben Youssef Madrasa raises the bar. The courtyard is nothing short of stunning, not only beautiful but a timely reminder that it must have been such an inspirational place to study when it was first opened. There isn't a huge amount of exhibits laid out in this area, bar a selection of large prints donated by the Photography Museum around the corner, however I think anything else would detract from the splendour in front of you. Guides regularly come and go and offer some extra information and insight into the history of the building, but these would have to be booked separately. As you delve into the student halls of residence (for want of a better expression), you start to realise that nothing much has changed in educational establishments in recent year (bar maybe some WiFi and TV dinners...). Certainly worth a visit, and there are lots of opportunity for keen photographers, and at only 10dirham represents excellent value for money. "

Struct Sunni Islam bans the depiction of people, animals and the like and with that in mind, artisan craftsmen developed highly decorative design styles that rely on the use of geometric patterns and calligraphy. As so often happens, constraints can force creativity rather then restrict it if you're determined enough to pursue beauty. Technique include the use of tiling, painting, wood and stone carving and stuccowork, all of which are in evidence at the Ben Youssef Medersa."

But I have heard a lot of people raving about it, so perhaps I'm missing something.I was most intrigued by the toilets.

Seeing where they slept (in small dorm rooms) made me think about all those boys reciting the Quran and learning their other subjects together in the middle of the Medina. The little doors and windows in the students' rooms are charming. The main courtyard and its tile work (zillij) were the largest I saw at any medersa in Morocco, and there are several magnificent carved wood ceilings. You can go up to the second floor and peer out the windows into the courtyard, getting a completely different perspective on this traditional architectural style. The building was completed in 1565 and is in beautiful condition. I really enjoyed spending time here, and it was not overrun with tours! Easy to find at the north end of the souks in the Medina."

Since the building of a new University, this was opened to the public. The artwork is in really good condition, the walls are decorated everywhere. The wood work of which there is plenty is in remarkable condition. Upstairs you will find small cells where the students to live and work. Well worth the visit and paying the small entrance fee"

The architecture, the mosaics, the intricate carving were all visually impressive, but we especially enjoyed our guide's explanations of its purpose as a religious school for boys. Boys with more influence were in the bigger dorm rooms with small windows while poorer ones were in tiny rooms without windows looking onto the courtyard. The guide also explained that pictures and sculpture were not allowed so the beautiful, intricately carved plaster work was decorative as well as delivering words of importance in Arabic."

It is an impressive building for Marrakesh but against say the Tower of London it scores 1 out of 10 or far less. It's not as good as Ann Hatherway's cottage as a tourist attraction. So in British terms, great building but empty with little to do except to wander around the small dusty rooms. For Marrakech this is a top attraction so get the hint! Most Brits would spend no more than 20 mins inside.There is nothing to see outside, as most of these buildings are faceless on the outside. Outside plenty of conmen and kids using aggressive and passive aggressive tactics to lose you and demand money. Difficult to find and the top Museum next door isn't any better ! The local tourist board can't exist or should be fired! Don't visit without a guide as trying to visit on foot is a trial of stress. Stay in your hotel and enjoy your sun holiday rather than visit unless it's part of a guided tour of the market.Stress is not a good holiday experience and it's not honestly worth it."

I was lucky enough to go at a time when there were not many people there, so there were plenty of excellent photographic opportunities. There are two floors for you to discover. The upstairs, which mostly consist of student dorms/rooms and you can pop you head out of a few 'windows' to see down into the courtyard.The ground floor has the amazing courtyard with a few more bigger rooms to discover, all with beautiful colours and calligraphy to be amazed by.

It used to be a place of Islamic scholarship but is now, for just a few dirham, open for visitors of all faiths to investigate. In season it may get crowded as non-Muslims cannot enter most of the city's mosques. But if you are lucky to arrive when it's relatively quiet you will appreciate its warren of small rooms - each formerly occupied by students - and attractive central areas."

Compared with other sites we visited this one was busy. An unprepossessing entrance opens, through magnificent doors into a central courtyard, Here should have been two pools of water. Perhaps due to the drought they are suffering at the moment, they were empty. However there was plenty other attractions for the eye. Very high quality stone and wood carving plus tiling decorated the walls all round the courtyard. At the far end another pair of magnificent doors lead to the Prayer Hall which is a beautiful pillared room with yet more carving and tiling to admire.You can get access to the upper level where students lived in very small rooms some without windows. Spartan comes to mind. The rooms were stark, the corridors dark and plain but the light wells were carved wood punctuating the upper spaces.There was no information so take your guide book if you want to know what you are looking at."

Is the best arhitecture that you will find in Marrakesh and maybe in entire Morocco."

You don't expect that it will look inside, from whats outside. It has beautiful moroccan tiles, you walk in through a corridor, and take a right and you are in the main plaza with the pool. There is great for photos, and see a lot of beautiful hallways. On top you have a bunch of very unique corridors around the dorms."

Being a popular tourist attraction, its over crowded spoiling the settings. When it was still running there were about 900 students living in the 132 rooms. Those room are bare and small, hard to imagine 6 to 7 students fitting in there, must have felt like a prison. With such places a lot depends on your guide, ours didn't have much to offer, so we were done with the site in under 10 minutes."

The problem is that you even pay for a guide, or you have to sit and work things out for yourself. There's nothing to explain what you are looking at. The decoration is fascinating. The bedrooms upstairs just need you to imagine living here."

Medersa (Madrasah, koranic school) Ali Ben Youssef with some 130 rooms bears the name of the sultan Ali Ben Youssef Ben Tchefine, the son of the founder of the city. Originally built in the XIV century and rebuilt by the saadies about 1570, is considered one of the most important koranic schools and knowledge dissemination centers in the Maghreb. Now open to the public cultural heritage, it is one of the few places with religious significance authorized for access to non-Muslims. Situated in the Medina, slightly north of the souks, very near the Ben Youssef Mosque and the Marrakesh Museum. The entrance, in a corner of the Ben Youssef square, is through a dark and ugly corridor leading to an impressive patio equipped with a large pool and surrounded by well-crafted columns and white marble floor. The madrasah is a beautiful example of architecture from the saad\u00ed period for its harmonious spaces and materials used \u2013colored mosaics (zellij), marble, and intricately carved stucco and wood panels. Must see a \"student room\" rebuilt, endowed with antique furniture that recreates the atmosphere of meditation and study of this institution. It is worth of devote three hours to this visit or more depending of the number of photos you may wish to take!! Very enjoyable with a group of friends: every one discovers a new corner!"

And the final kicker; for a place that charges entry admission, to have quite simply the most disgusting toilets in the whole of Marrakech, with no toilet seats OR toilet paper, and then have a guard standing at the entry way holding out his hand for a tip before standing aside to let you exit, is utterly reprehensible. He heard exactly what I thought and stepped aside timidly with an empty hand. Don't be bullied by people holding out their hand at toilets in Marrakech."

This Madrasa is a jewel ... assuming you can find it because it's buried in the principal Medina souk. I went with a personal guide who knew exactly where to go. For whatever reason (it is the onset of winter in Morocco and cold), there were not the hoards of visitors reported by other commentators here.So, yes, the subtle colors, the complex designs, the various materials used (wood, marble, etc.) all combined to make this just a very special place and one that I'll never forget. But it is also more than that. It is centuries old. It was (and is no longer) a place of Islamic learning and you get a sense of what it would have been like a half a millennia ago. But more than the architecture and it's role as a place of learning, is the feeling of calm and what might be termed spirituality. See (or feel) for yourself."

If it is the first time you have seen this type of building then you will be incredibly impressed by the ornate carvings and very intricate detailing of the mosaic. The Madrassa is a visual feast, however like most tourist attractions in Morocco, if you don't have a guide to talk you through what you are looking at, it won't be more than a few minutes of looking at something pretty, as they do not have plaques explaining what the buildings or rooms were or anything explaining about what you are looking at. You will also constantly be hounded wherever you walk but people telling you that the buildings are closed, there's nothing down where you are walking and to go to their shop."

The Ben Youssef Madrasa is a popular site in the most visited city in Morocco, so while it's certainly a lovely spot to escape the hubbub of the medina, don't expect to find solitude. It's well known and anyone will be able to direct you to the right spot should you get lost. The courtyard is spacious and bright. The details in the cedar carvings, stucco, and tile work are impressive. Spend some time walking around the second level and you can imagine students in the classrooms and dorms from centuries ago. Any of the small rooms provide a lovely vantage point of the central courtyard. If you're there at the right time, you can hear the call of the muezzin. It's easy to just walk around take some pictures, and that would be a fine - a walk around would take 15-20 min. But if you stay and settle in a bit and put away the camera phone, you'd get to appreciate the space. I sat down in a little room under the sun and read The Alchemist, and it was lovely."

It is easy to walk straight by the small entrance door to the former Islamic school without noticing it, but the locals who stop you to direct you in really are being helpful - after a dis-orientating wander around the souks, it is easy to imagine that everyone wants to sell you something or be your guide but Marrakech can always surprise you and many people genuinely do just like to welcome visitors! It is an impressive building. Thousands of beautiful tiles, arches, narrow staircases and what seemed like hundreds of tiny 'cells' (the students' study-bedrooms) arranged geometrically around each corridor. There are toilets in the original bathroom area which are interesting whether you need the facilities or not."

I got in early as where I staying was on the same side of town and it was an interesting walk to it outside the Medina. The Madrasa like most attractions in Marrakech has little background available freely on the walls as the guides need work I guess but plaques would have detracted from the beautiful decorative and intricate features here. It was a marvellous delight and the carvings, tiles and stone work are wonderful and kept me captivated in contemplation while I was there - they are awesome. You can wander round some of the cells which have received little restorative work and adds to their appeal as it helps you imagine what it must have been like for the students. It got busy after a couple of hours as more people arrived but it was ok (unlike the impact of crowds at the Jardin Majorelle). I would highly recommend this jewel of a building for a visit if you want to get up close to some fascinating Islamic decorative art."

While it concentrated on Koranic studies it was also at the leading edge of many other other specialisations.The mosaics are spectacular (all hand cut) but perhaps not to the same standard as it's fellow seat of learning in Fez.The cedar wooden ceilings and other carved doors have stood the test of time and display an insight into the skills of the craftsman who built this so long ago.Take the time to climb up to the upper floors for views into the courtyard and see the very small student rooms.The lectures were principally held at the nearby mosque."

The children loved walking on the first floor and looking outside down below. The visit here doesn't take too long.Next door to the Morroco Museum and round the corner from the Ben Youssef mosque. It is difficult to find as it is deep in the medina. We used our GPS to guide us. Takes 15minutes walking from the main Jema El Fena square."

Originally Built as a boys school this stunning building is breathtaking, with bright intricate mosaics and complex plasterwork, marble carved oillars and wooden finials and framework, it's s real feast for the eyes. You can go upstairs to see the many smaller honeycombed rooms where the boys slept, all built in a pattern around a central open space that varied in size and decoration depending on the status of the boys. The most brilliant students having large rooms overlooking the central square and pool.There were only a coule of exhibits so unfortunately yet again we were left wondering just how these people lived, what their furniture, clothes, food, life was like was left unexplained. Despite this lack of detail the building itself is well worth a visit. Perhaps having a guide would benefit by filling in the gaps of information."

Our guide explained the background of the building and how male students would come from all parts of Morocco and other countries to study.Built around 1565 by the Saadian Sultan Moulay Abdellah, there are 130 small rooms which would house up to 900 boarding students.It was used until the 1960's. Students then moved to a new building.The workmanship around the main courtyard is fantastic. there is carved vertical panels, marble columns and tiles which were added at a later.There is an ablutions basin in the courtyard as well as a prayer hall.Really work seeing."

The design of this 14th century learning center is well refleted in the way that allows sun light and air flow in rooms and classes.

On our exit from the Madrasa the youth was waiting for us and this time I told him to take us straight to the taxi and no maze! Which he did! When we offered him the MAD 30 he wanted more of course which we declined and there was a kerfuffle between another man and the taxi driver but eventually we left!

That is how people lived, and still do for the most part. I taught at the successor of this school - Thanawiyat Medrasa Ben Youssef. Peace Corps. English. The school was housed in a former barracks for Senegalese troops to keep order for the French. Called \"Dar al Barood\", or house of guns. The French, and the Senegalese, were sent off in 1956, during independence. Thanawiyat Ben Youissef was taken over by the Istaqlal (Independence) Party of Morocco, to uplift Moroccan youth. Long story short, nice kids, no money for books or electricity (Peace Corps - who cares), great experience. The present school is a decent museum of the past. Some of my colleagues at Dar al Barood actually taught at the old school. I love being part of its history."

We arrived about 9.30am and were there for a good hour or so, by which time it was starting to get busy with tour groups so do go early for a quiet visit and the best photography opportunities.Something to also note is that the 3-in-1 that has been mentioned in some past reviews is no longer available. It was only 10dh to get in and a further 50dh for the museum next door though so still VERY cheap. It was also easy to find, simply by following the Souks at Jemaa el Fna all the way through from the bottom to the top, and it's sign-posted from there.The place is absolutely beautiful and the maze of rooms within the building provide some relief from the heat. There are also toilets which is a plus! We didn't have a guide as we explored the city ourselves from the basis of our riad, but the guidebook we had (a DK Top 10) had a lot of information so this gave us a good background to the building, its origin and history. I could've spent all day here."

Culturally this has to be one of the most fascinating places one can visit.Islamic world is going through a difficult time at the moment but this place takes one back to a time over hundreds of years when the faith of hundreds was captured in a school of learning.The Madrasa is a boarding school where 800 or more students of the Quran studied intensively to become scholars on the subject. Morocco is a secular state and respects all cultures and religions and adopts its own form of Islam. This beautiful and peaceful place is simply beautifully constructed in the heart of the Medina and has not just stunning architecture but beautiful frescoed pictures and tiled murals and floors.It truly feels that only yesterday this was a thriving school. The most impressive and deepest impression this place leaves is how such a peaceful haven can exist in Morocco.I would suggest this as one of the top places in Marrakech to visit, along with:Marjorelle Gardens (stunning)Saadian tombs (last on the list)Comptoir (for dinner)Sofitel terraces (for affordable elegance)"

It was a little difficult to find as the entrance is through the narrow streets of the souks but we asked shop vendors who happily directed us. It's only 10Dh each and our 4 year old was free."

This madrasa was one of the largest theological colleges in North Africa and may have housed as many as 900 students. It was closed down in 1960. The building was refurbished and reopened to the public as an historical site in 1982.

The space is just amazing. Because you get to roam the madrasa without any security guards or workers (the only 2 I saw were the guy that takes your money and the other one that offers to write your name in arabic for a few dirham), it really gives you a chance to take your time and just take in the experience of being there, immersed in the history. The place isn't really preserved, nothing is roped off and I could not recommend it more. Especially if you have somehow grown tired of the medina (which can be a feat in and of itself)"

The carvings and size of the place leaves you in awe. A very cool place in the hot sun but cold on a night I would think !Cheap to get in and I hope they are spending it on renovation as the walls were peeling away."

But we persisted, and found an old building that is beautiful but with limited ( and I say this as someone who is very interested in history). Things to do/ see. Basically there is the entrance, a courtyard and the plain rooms around and over looking the courtyard. Entrance in 50 dirham, or 60 if you want to go to the museum as well."

The ex college has dozens of hallways and 130 student dormitory cells clustered around a courtyard richly carved in cedar, marble and stucco. The details in the carvings are just beyond words, the effort put in is amazing, even the wooden ceiling has intricate patterns painted in the most out of sight places! I'm sure it wasn't nice to live in the college at the time but I wouldn't mind staying there if they were ever turned into a type of hostel!"

Zoom in close with your camera for some stunning photos.Toilets are available and 'western' and clean.The rooms are similar, but have fun trying to work out which ones the rich lived in and which ones the poor.lGet a combi ticket to cover the other sites as well.By the Koubba there is a small cafe to get some mint tea."

The main hall and courtyard is simply stunning no matter which direction you look. There is tile work, carved cedar, carved stucco, calligraphy, brass lights, and the list goes on...all stunning. There is a small pool in the center of the courtyard. There is access to the dorms on the second floor and some have windows where you can look across the courtyard. Dorms are very small and very plain as well. I would really recommend going through this facility with a guide. They will provide information about the age of the building, the purpose of the building, the various modes of architecture, as well as explanations about the calligraphy present on the walls and pillars. If you are stuck as to how to hire a guide, I would recommend talking to the owners of the riad or hotel where you are staying. Some stairs are involved if you wish to visit the dorms so if you have health or physical limitations, just visit the main floor."

Set in the midst of the souk and market area, this historically important madrassa, centuries old and now a major tourist attraction, is a very beautiful, peaceful place to visit. It gives only a tiny glimpse of life in these traditional koranic schools. The building is ornate and the architecture is very beautiful, offering a sense of the spiritual. It stands out even more juxtaposed against the busy, narrow lanes, markets and souks nearby. Do visit, but buy your coffee elsewhere, the little coffee shop at the entrance/exit charges over \u00a32 per cup!"

The central courtyard - similar to Patio of the Lions in the Alhambra - is one of best examples, if not THE best example, of Saadian art and architecture. Fantastically photogenic place - it's also great for taking photos of you and your friends appearing at the little windows of the students' cells giving onto the court."

Covered in ornamental wooden cladding, the bedrooms and studies are an excellent way to imagine times gone by in the Medina. However, the building was in regular use as often as 75 years ago. There is a large number of internal Riad-like courtyards which have bedrooms coming off -- so many, in fact, that they become irritatingly repetitive. They do look so very similar. My advice would be to visit two of the internal sets and then venture outside to the main yard, which is beautifully covered in Moroccan tiling. Near the entrance to the courtyard you have the opportunity to buy (expensive) bottled drinks from a refrigerator and have your name written in Arabic for c.DH30 MAD. Much of the fun in this place is actually getting to it. Because of the Medina's narrow streets, only a few cars venture down and certainly no taxis. Your driver will drop you off by the entrance to a souk street. Keep walking for about five minutes straight (ignore any guides who offer you tours -- they will end up taking you to their family stalls rather than the Medersa, or will demand high payments) and then turn left when you see the sign. Signposts (or 'plaques' in French) are few and rare, but they are there. If you need directions, ask someone in a restaurant rather than a Moroccan sitting outside their stand. You will also be followed a lot down here by Moroccan 'guides', so just keep your valuables covered and secure and say 'non, merci' when they offer you assistance. After a winding section of streets you'll come to the Medersa (entrance is c.DH10 MAD) and the Marrakech Museum is nearby. You can buy joint entry in the Medersa. The Maison de la Photographie is nearby, so you could do all three in a morning/early-afternoon and then return down the souks for lunch. I'd recommend avoiding any restaurants in the streets as they are rarely hygienic and many tourists contract food-poisoning from them. You are also likely to get better deals on Moroccan souvenirs here as the shops are less-frequented than by the Djemaa El-Fna."

It is a photographer's dream to capture the unique tile work, woodwork and architecture. Go upstairs and see where the older boys stayed and take pictures of the courtyard below. There is a person who will write your name in Arabic for 3 euros. The cost of the museum is 50 dirhams but pay 60 dirhams for the museum next door as a combined ticket."

As you approach this authentic Moroccan Madrasa /School through Marrakech's dusty streets , there's not much to suggest what you will find behind its plain wooden doors. Maybe the ornately tiled series of horseshoe arches across the street will give you a hint - they aren't that common in the city. It's a school that taught the Koran for over half a millennium. The courtyard, built around a shallow reflecting pool, is contained by four ornately decorated walls. From the zillij tiled floor, pilasters rise up to meet great cornices carved from ancient cedar wood. Two doors, pitched beneath overlapping arches, lead you to the two dormitories, which you can visit for framed views of the courtyard below. The dormitories are plain by comparison to the courtyard !!"

It became the biggest and most beautiful \u2018medersa\u2019 of Morocco and Northern Africa. Ben Youssef Medersa is named after Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. In 1950 the building was restored and reopened as a kind of museum in 1982.The Ben Youssef Medersa has two faces. After entering the building through a more or less dark passageway, we reached the large central courtyard with the ablution pool. This is the really rich decorated part of this former koranic school with beautiful stuccowork, carved cedar wood, marble and (of course) zellij mosaics of tiles. The reflections of the massive bronze door and the decorated wall in the water were just stunning.Opposite this entrance is a prayer room beautifully decorated with palm motifs and Islamic calligraphy. The tiny \u2018rooms\u2019 of the students are in sharp contrast with these richly decorated parts of the Medersa. Most of these 130 cells are on the first floor and housed the 900 students, which means in these tiny and basic cells six people had to live and sleep; almost incredible. Most of these sleeping quarters are formed around seven smaller courtyards; some of them had windows and a couple even to the roads outside the building (a rarity in this kind of buildings). A couple of these student rooms do have some furniture and other (student) belongings. Don\u2019t forget to take a look through one of the windows with a great view of the courtyard. Ben Youssef Medersa is not too big, but we got a nice impression of this well-preserved religious school and the beautiful Moroccan (Saadian) architecture; one of the highlights of our Marrakech visit."

The museum and Madrasa is a must see if you are visiting Marrakesh (they are right next to each other and it is best to buy tickets to both together). I wanted to write a quick review to also offer some advice to other tourists. You have to get here on foot, as it is very complicated if not impossible to get to by car. There are signs leading you through the market to get there, but they are often hard to see. DO NOT ask anyone just standing around for directions. We tried this and got told by a local 20 something year old that the Madrasa was just around the corner and that he could take us. He immediately got on the phone. After walking for about 5 minutes in what appeared to be the wrong direction I asked him if this was really the way to the Madrasa, he said yes but that the Madrasa was closed. He told us he was taking us somewhere better. I decided to ask a shop keeper instead who informed me we were in fact going in the wrong direction. I thanked our makeshift tour guide and explained to him that we wouldn't require any more of his services. Lesson: Ask only shop keepers or even other tourists (you will know if they are tourists or not) for directions. DO NOT allow anyone not from an agency to be your \"tour guide\" especially in the markets. And DO NOT follow anybody. Who know's what or where this guy was planning on taking us."

There are many chambers which students used as their quarters whilst there and it is amazing at just how many students it held (around 900). The buildings themselves are beautiful and certainly a great place for the budding (or professional photographer). Literally wall to wall mosaic and never-ending ornate wood carvings and architecture. Whilst we were there a young guy was making Arabic name plates for about 3 euros each. We bought 2 for our children and paid a little extra for a Wedding present (two names entwined) - back home and mounted in a frame it is simply stunning and was definitely a unique wedding gift. Overall, a lovely place to visit."

We were approached by someone claiming to be a guide after looking around for a while, but it was unclear whether it was legit. Strongly recommend reading the background about this and other sites before you visit them."

The intricate carvings and detailing on the tiles is simply extraordinary! Some of the best I've ever seen in all my travels.Overall, highly enjoyable and thoroughly recommended!"

According to the story that madrasa was a place for students lodgement, as for classrooms.The students bedrooms were so little that I realy doubt that they could not have anything in the room than a little bed.There was a structure like a patio, and the rooms oppen in the patio (4 rooms). At the visit I tried to be clarified where were the classrooms, but the local guide could not clarify that question.The architectonic structure was very interessant, and at the groundfloor there was a patio with a fountain, and the toilet room was interesting, for the open irrigation water for the students toilet.At the final, we asked ourselves : This was a student prision???"

Entrance: 50 Dhm per person with additional 10 Dhm if you wish to enter the museum (round the corner). Museum worth going even for its architecture. To give you history of the Madrasa (religious school/college) I have taken a description from wikipedia. The Ben Youssef Madrasa was an Islamic college in Marrakech, Morocco, named after the Almoravid sultan Ali ibn Yusuf (reigned 1106\u20131142), who expanded the city and its influence considerably. It is the largest Medrasa in all of Morocco.The college was founded during the period of the Marinid (14th century) by the Marinid sultan Abu al-Hassan and allied to the neighbouring Ben Youssef Mosque. The building of the madrasa was re-constructed by the Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib (1557\u20131574). In 1565 the works ordered by Abdallah al-Ghalib were finished, as confirmed by the inscription in the prayer room. Its 130 student dormitory cells cluster around a courtyard richly carved in cedar, marble and stucco. The carvings contain no representation of humans or animals as required by Islam, and consist entirely of inscriptions and geometric patterns. This madrasa was one of the largest theological colleges in North Africa and may have housed as many as 900 students. One of its best known teachers was Mohammed al-Ifrani (1670-1745).Closed down in 1960, the building was refurbished and reopened to the public as an historical site in 1982.Reference: Courtesy of Wikipedia."

You do need someone to explain and give you a tour around the building as all the signs are only in french and Arabic and you would not be able to guess the history! It was quite hard to find the school and in the sun you do get a bit frustrated as there are no signs or arrows so you just have to keep asking the locals, who were really friendly. It was worth the 60 dh entrance fee as it included a visit to the Marrakesh museum down the road from this 'madrassa'. You only need 2 hours to see both places as they're both not so big. This was a nice escape from the busy souk and the hot sun.. I would recommend this as a morning visit."

This place is everything you expect it to be and more. The architecture, like the rest of Marrakech has been perfected to an exceptional standard. The Madrasa is well maintained and we enjoyed exploring this labyrinth of a building. Tour guides are available at an additional, small expense. You could easily spend a good few hours around here as it offers so much culture. As much as we loved the chaos of the Medina, it was insightful to reflect and try to comprehend school life here.A must see whilst in Marrakech!"

The contrast of small, plain cells with the intricate decoration of the public, shared spaces is stunning. Like other Moroccan Andalusian buildings, the lush detail of plaster carving, zellij (mosaic tile), painted and carved wood of the public spaces combine to create a harmonious and meditative space. Cool, dark private rooms open unexpectedly to sun drenched, blue sky lit courts or shafts and the dramatic contrast makes this recently renovated building strikingly beautiful, definitely worth a visit."

There is a joint ticket for the Madrasa and the Museum of Marrakech, which is less interesting, but worth the few extra Dirham (I wouldn't pay full price for the single entry ticket to the museum only). If you get a bit lost on your way here, don't accept directions from \"Guides\" (there are no official guides) as this will result in demands for money, or a trip to a shop, which will overcharge your to pay your \"guides\" commision. If you want directions ask a shop keeper or a restaurant receptionist (and express interest in returning after you have seen the madrasa to shop or dine)."

We went to this old school one afternoon, and only just got there in time to look around quickly before it closed at 6pm as we struggled to find it. However when we eventually did it was very interesting to see the boarding rooms and the beautiful architecture. As other people have mentioned, it was a shame that there aren't signs in English - a tour guide would probably be worth investing in. For only 50 Dirhams entry it is definitely worth going to see, just make sure you allow yourself enough time to find it! Also, don't be fooled by locals telling you that it is closed and that you should go with them to see the tanneries instead."

Much of the stucco work has been restored and is fantastic - very similiar to the Alhambra in Granada Spain. Some of the artwork on the ceilings is also very impressive.Initially it is awe inspiring and interesting but there is a lot of it and it is easy to become a little blase about it after a while. The site has great potential to provide a great visitor experience but currently it is great to look at but unless you have a guide book(we did) it fails on a number of levels. It would be easy to kit out some of the rooms to show what the students had to experience. There were only 2 out oof 132 rooms with some furniture etc but no signs showing where they are so without a guide book you have to stumble upon them."

The Medersa used to be founded in the 14th century. It was rebuild by the Saadians. It used to be a Koran school until 1962 before it was closed down. Up to 900 people lived in the 130 student rooms of the Medersa. The architecture and the displayed craftsmanship were amazing. Especially the inner courtyard was beautiful. Whilst walking across the courtyard you could look up to some of the dorm rooms. There were a lot of astonishing wood carvings, stucco- and tileworks. In the middle of the courtyard was a little pool. The architecture was fantastic and I loved all the details, unfortunately all the rooms were empty. I felt the entry fee of 50 DRH was a fair price to pay for this attraction. Usually shrines and mosques are not open to be visited by non-muslims. Therefore it is incredible interesting to enter this old Koran school. Another highlight for me was that there was a local calligraphy artist in the courtyard who offered to paint your name in Arabic letters."

Although it costs only 10 dirhams more to combine this with a visit to the Marrakesh Museum, it is probably wiser to save the 10 dirhams as the museum is not worth spending your time on. There were six in our group, and the 60 dirhams saved would have paid for one pair of leather slippers or 18 fresh large beignets with honey or three large breads stuffed with meat or 15 orange juices at the place Jemaa-el-Fna."

You'll only need to spend 20 mins or so in here exploring, and there's no documentation of anything in English, but there is in French and Arabic. There are a few guides walking around who will answer questions and give you a little history; it's a must see. The word carvings and tile work are stunning!"

The architecture is exotic and ornate. The school is a dizzying grid of rooms, pillars and passageways. Everywhere you look, there is something to see. I enjoyed sticking my head through the tiny windows and climbing up the primitive ladders to the various rooms where young students once stayed. Pay special attention to the delicate wood carvings that grace the door and hallways. The tile and inlay work is beautiful. When you buy a ticket for the museum (another worthy outing), you can buy a package that contains entrance to the Ben Youssef school. The school is just steps away from the museum. I highly recommend a visit. ***Also, there is an amazing shopping square nearby that not only has incredible colors and textures for photos - they sell baby turtles and chameleons. Keep an eye out for it!"

The only problem is that this famous site gets so crowded, especially with coach parties.

If you don't want to go to a hard sell antique rug store - tell them up front. The Madrasa was a school at one point and gives a good look into the historical school environment. I couldn't imagine living and studying in such small little rooms (cold, cold rooms in December). Our guide took us to the Madrasa as well as the Marrakech Maison - one ticket gets you to both.

For 50 dirham you get access to a very old Islamic school.I went first thing in the morning and had the whole place to myself. Awe inspiring does not do the building justice. The quality and sheer beauty of the carvings and mosaic work are simply stupendous. How 800 plus students fitted into the building defies belief.The ground floor dormitories were obviously for junior students with no windows apart from high level ones, presumably to discourage young students from being distracted by the outside world.Upstairs the rooms are bigger and there is a more relaxed feeling.The main courtyard is light and airy and it is hard not to simply gaze in wonder at the beauty of the building.I felt it a real privilege to be able to access this madresa and hope that many more people will do so as well."

A good mock-up for two student rooms (one from the city and one from the country). Cedar wood carving and non-image mosaics. Excellent photo opportunities with the sun streaming through the minute quadrangles and on the main central fountain. Wished a tossed dirham into the water. Very tranquil and idyllic.

This one was much better because while the decorations, shape and size are much the same as the one in Fes, this one is no longer used for religious purposes so it is much more open. You can walk upstairs to see the student's chambers, which is very interesting. It is so easy to find this place and with the combined ticket price for the Marrakesh Museum, there is definitely no reason to not check out the Medersa."

The Museum of Marrakech (almost next door) and the Maison de la Photographie (around the corner) are also very worthwhile. You can get a double ticket with the Museum which offers a reduction on buying two separate ones. For lunch nearby, try Le Jardin."

Entrance fee 60 dirhams combined ticket for this and the Marrakech museum which is just 40 yards away . Not that easy to find if you go through the souks to get to it !

That was ok, but some other visitors were being shown around and given the detailed history of the place. Just insist on your moneys worth!

The tile and clay work is in an excellent condition and shows the best of Marrakech architecture. Marrakech otherwise does not have a lot to see in my opinion and in terms of culture and history this building was worth the visit. We found finding things in Marrakech quite difficult so a map is a must and constantly asking for directions is a good idea."

We found it quite hard to fine, its down a dark corridor which opens into a very pretty courtyard with a pool in the center. inside you can walk up two staircases which take you into the very small living spaces of the students that used to go to the school. One downside is that all the information is in french, it was also quite expensive for what it was, but overall im pleased we went."

This is reached by walking through the souks from Jamaa El Fna square, the walk was a very pleasant revelation as the souks open out and become more Moroccan than touristy, head for the market of vegetables, you will pass a couple of small butchers stalls but nothing to distress on view. There are a couple of well patronised cafes offering well priced lunches on the way. The Medersa is a beautifully and tastefully restored school for the teaching of the Muslim faith. The intricate detail on the walls and around the doors is delicious and quite unlike any other form of architectural detail I have seen before. Its fascinating to see the rooms that where occupied by the scholars. The pool in the centre of the courtyard is very inviting on a hot day. For 10 MADs more you can visit Koubba El Badiyan which is opposite Musee de Marrakech (also included) The ticket is valid for one day. The Musee has a small cafe, and although the exhibits are not all that amazing the building itself is a restored palace and has some spectacular rooms. These are certainly well worth a visit. We did continue to find the fountain which is listed as a Unesco world heritage site, which makes it sound a lot grander than it is, it is simply a water tap in a coloured wall with a carved wood ceiling, to my mind its not worth the trrek."

Fortunately in Marrakech there's a religious building that is open to the public which will give you a glimpse of classic Islamic architecture and that's the Ben Youssef Medersa.A Medersa is a form of Islamic college where students go to learn the Koran. The Ali Ben Youssef Medersa was founded in the 14th Century and takes its name from the nearby Ben Youssef Mosque which in turn was named for a 12th century sultan of the same name. Most of what visitors will see today was built in the 16th century and has been renovated since the college closed back in the 1960s. On our first visit to Morrocco about 8 or 9 years ago, we were taken to see the medersa and our tour guide used it as a great way to introduce us to some of the classic elements of Islamic architecture and design. With some of that teaching still embedded in my mind \u2013 and many more visits to mosques and other Islamic religious places since then \u2013 I was pretty sure we could show my sister and her girlfriend around without needing to join a guided tour during our recent holiday.The Sunni form of Islam places a lot of very strict constraints on architects and decorators which are noticeably absent in the Shia form. Struct Sunni Islam bans the depiction of people, animals and the like and with that in mind, artisan craftsmen developed highly decorative design styles that rely on the use of geometric patterns and calligraphy. As so often happens, constraints can force creativity rather then restrict it if you're determined enough to pursue beauty. Technique include the use of tiling, painting, wood and stone carving and stuccowork, all of which are in evidence at the Ben Youssef Medersa. The layout of the Medersa is a classic example of such buildings throughout the Muslim world. There's a large central courtyard with an ablutions pool where people perform their cleansing rituals before proceeding to the high ceilinged prayer hall beyond. Down either side of this courtyard on the upper floor are a series of small 'cells' where the students lived and slept and beyond them smaller inner courtyards of tiny and very simple rooms arranged around wooden balconies. The doorways are particularly eye-catching with highly decorated arches and finely carved wooden doors hung inside them. They won't keep out the drafts but they look fabulous.The Medersa gets very busy and you'll possibly have to bite your tongue with frustration when you're lining up a lovely photograph and one of the many other tourists walks right into the middle. It takes patience to get people-free shots. If you have control over your time, try to go early in the day or late in the afternoon when fewer people are there. Go only at mid-day if you want to avoid shadows in your photos.The Medersa is open every day so don't believe anyone who tries to tell you that it isn't and lures you off to a shop or stings you for a 'private tour' of somewhere you weren't planning to go. The entrance fee is 50 dirhams but for another 10 Dirhams on top you get access to the Marrakech Museum and a strange old bathhouse on the same ticket. The bathhouse is a bit of a non-event but the Marrakech Museum is well worth the supplement."

You pay a small fee to enter and once inside are free to roam with or without a guide.The architecture is beautiful, and the main courtyard with the carved and tiled walls features in a number of guidebooks as a must-see. There is a room still set up as an example of the living-quarters of the pupils, with a small lecturn ready for the Holy Book studies which last for hours. A beautiful peaceful place to visit, and quite humbling.It is near to the Museum, and the early fist places of worship,"

We visited the madersa/school on a day tour of the city with a guide (definitely recommended, but arrange for either a full or half days tour, and say what sights you want to see or visit).The entrance fee was 60dh (with 12dh to the \u00a3), so quite expensive for Morocco.There was loads to see, but you need either a good book or guide to explain the different rooms and everyday life of the students who attended the school. The mosaics, carvings and decoration were all lovely.We were told that 900 pupils attended at any one time and they all lived on site. Their rooms varied from quite large with a window and view of the courtyard to really small and dark with no window (but you needed a guide to tell you why). The Moroccans are still not very switched on to tourism so there are no leaflets, guide books or signs informing you of what exactly you are looking at. So on the whole a good guide book or guide are essential to get the most from any tourist attraction in Morocco."

The Ben Youssef Medersa is probably one of the more under rated attractions of Marrakech but it's definitely worth seeing both because the history behind it as a school and university is very interesting and also because it's architecture and the intricate detail used is amazing to see first hand. Also unlike other attractions, you can get away with seeing this without a guide but for a full appreciation it's probably better to go with one."

For 60 dirhams you can enjoy the Medersa ben Youssef, the Museum of Marrakech and the Almoravid koubba on one ticket, ideal for an overcast day.The Medersa (madrassa) is a Merinid construction of about 1300 AD, but rebuilt during the Saadian period some two hundred years later. (same as the tombs.) It was the centre of Koranic studies. The courtyard is magnificent and the ornamental cedar ceilings are equally inspiring. Perhaps the most interesting part 'though were the two \"cells\" in the student dormatories - one for the \"better off\" the other more basic.There is a cafe associated with these attractions which is popular with visitors. Avoid however invitations to visit the tanneries at nearby Bab Debbagh."

The tiling along the walls and the plaster decorations must have taken years to complete. If you are in Marrakech, then take a look at this Medrassa, you will not be dissappointed."

Amazing architecture, beautiful spaces and very intricate stucco, wood and marble engravings reminiscent of the glorious days when the arab art was flourishing on both sides of Mediterranean. However, leaving the main patio and stepping into the big background alcove one can only be shocked by the poor maintenance of the building. Dirty painting, plaster falling off the walls and broken lights seem completely out of place in a monument which charges 50 Dirhams ( 5 \u20ac) per person to get in. The amount of money made from entries in just 1 day would be plenty to remiedate all these faults.Just another example of local authorities lack of initiative and laxism and a big embarassement for such an outstanding monument in such a magic city."
