(I'm sure families with kids would find it fantastic).The only bad things about it were the hard sell pictures. It was really annoying, at one of the picture stands the girl accidentally printed out the pictures and you would of thought she'd just give us one anyway with it being an accident but nope!Another thing is that all the animals seemed happy in the environment they were in apart from the massive crocodiles. I know it's a big exhibition for the aquarium but i felt bad for them as they were in such a small enclosure for how big they were, it was a shame and I actually felt guilty about paying money to see it."

One of the best afternoons I've had in dubai. reasonably priced when compared to other family activities in dubai more than just an aquarium also includes some smaller winter climate animals such as penguins and nocturnal animal area was magical the world's biggest crocodile and the bird area with rare birds such as the golden finches were cherries on top spent several hours and didn't even realise the time passing my family included a 2 year old and 60+year olds and each of us had an excellent time the glass bottom boat was one of the best bits where we got up close to the fish didn't try the Explorer zone or swimming with the sharks but I'm sure the latter especially would be epic the kids loved having a feel at the star fish the variety of beautiful fish, the clean and beautiful created environment, the friendly staff and the educational information provided about each animal species just led to a wonderful and memorable experience"

Visited with family, this is a seemingly great attraction in the middle of the mall however the living conditions for some inhabitants were shocking at least. The otter, water rat and penguin enclosures were overcrowded and the animals were clearly suffering from stress, overheating and looked pretty depressed! On this alone I would discourage people to visit until the zoo takes action on this. I'm no vet so would welcome any counter-argument from the zoo."

The tunnel is spectacular, and though the exhibit is not as expansive as Singapore SeaWorld, it was teeming with sharks and the shark week exhibits were informative. The aquarist programs at AED 150 were a combo of the Researcher and Explorer packs (so u get both the flat bottomed boat ride and the behind the scenes). The behind the scenes was largely about feeding these enormous sea creatures and their babies. But the guides are efficient while being patient with the kids questions. The boat (punt) just rides over the tank, but is a must see. The feeding is nice if standing in deep sea water till your knees among fast gliding rays is your thing. The divers seemed to be making heavy weather (just remember its just a large tank).The mall has cute views, with vast expanses of glass. Particularly liked the divers near the H&M stores who take pics of you when you are standing at a designated spot. The posed photos are borderline scam, but are fun if you are a large group."

Nonetheless, the beginning part of the aquarium is good, you get to see all the sharks. At the entrance they take your pictures and price wise it's not worth it at all. Just another money making scheme, we were told that all the pictures would cost \u00a370! Or if we wanted to buy one then \u00a320. Not worth it at all, so we kindly declined. The underwater zoo is okay, smells quite fishy as it's more of an open tank area with a variety of fishes. They have penguins there as well. The underwater zoo is on the third floor so finding it and getting to it is a little tricky. All in all it was okay, but I personally preferred lost chambers at the Atlantis."

Other than sharks, fish, and 6 different types of rays, they have owls, parrots, otters, two MASSIVE crocodiles, and penguins."

There is a tunnel to walk though where you feel part of the sea with sharks and enormous rays swimming around you. Then you move upstairs with various large tanks of fish all excellently displayed. Further along there are giant spider crabs, penguins and an enormous crocodile (eek). Really kept my 3yr old entertained. There is a large part of the main tank visible from shopping centre but there is much more to see when you pay to get inside. Well worth it and a good indoor activity to escape a hot day!!"

After visiting it, I know now they meant aquarium tank, not the aquarium complex. Given the price (AED 100+), I was a bit disappointed. I do not understand why ppl would say this was better than Singapore aquarium, as the place was not big. It's good for small kids though, but I have seen better. The highlight would be indeed the king Croc..Indeed, what ppl say about the other fact is true as well; you can see the large aquarium tank inside the mall. No need to pay for the entrance."

With this ticket you see the underwater tunnel, underwater zoo, back of house tour and glass floor. It's over 2 floors and even the windows of the shop that you come out of has fish in the windows, just amazing.All definitely worth the money.

King Croc was bigger than I'd expected as were some of the sharks, the whole experience was positive, my only criticism would be the management need to put another member of staff on to see through those who already have tickets as waiting behind people who can't make up their mind/what they want to do/see is somewhat annoying. As you filter into the tunnel you have the obligatory photo shoot. Would recommend as a must see/do when visiting Dubai, our tickets allowed admittance at any time regardless of the Khalifa time slot."

I was a little bit concerned of wasting my time (and money) but I ended my visit (slow pace) after about 2 hours with a more than positive feeling.I recommend the explorer pass that gives you access to the underwater zoo and a tour on a boat with glass-bottom: navigating above sharks and races and dozen of fishes is quite impressive. The zoo deserves visit as it includes wonderful jellyfishes, dragon fish, nautilus and finally the BIG King croc. Despite having already visited several other aquariums this showed me some unknown creatures. Time well spent."

There's sooooo many different types of sea creatures in here and it's the most massive glass aquarium in the world it's hard to not be impressed. Depending on your pace it can take a good half a day to wander around, looking at each thing, reading up on the inhabitants and generally making to most of it. It seems quite expensive at first, but then actually, when you realise how much there is it's really worth it. I think they do family tickets too which would obviously be a bonus for those with kids. My friend and i opted to go on the boat trip at the end of our tour which although well planned and safe wasn't really for me, more for little ones who have maybe never been on a boat before and would be excited to see the fish from above. Get this place on your itinerary!"

This is one of the most well Decorated huge Aquarium with uncountable beautiful creatures to showcase. You have different Packages for visiting the same like Aquarium only, Explorer Package or Higher Package where you get to feed the sharks.The place is huge and takes a good 1.5 Hrs time to cover non-stop with photo shoots. So keep good time in hand. Interiors may be confusing and you may skip few areas so be careful to cover all areas."

This is not the case with this attraction. It is truly unreal and a must see if you are a true tourist with little regard for value for money. Unlike its name leads you to believe it is not an aquarium as such but rather an underwater 20m tunnel with fish all around you, because of the mass of people you will be pushed through it in about 5 minutes. Then you go through to the other side and it's over. So I'm glad we did it because we got to do the level 125 Burj khalifa and this as a combo deal for cheaper, but if we were to go back to Dubai I wouldn't do it again."

Then we got to go to the zoo which had mini aquariums and was pretty cool. Their king croc was hugeeeee bigger than anything I have seen. It was a good trip and would be amazing for kids. Only reservation is that they have many photo stops for you to take pictures and pay (and they are quite pricey)"

We got a master card deal on entry for the tunnel/underwater zoo (2 for 1 - 70 dirhams) and then paid an extra 100 dirhams for both of us to go on the simulator/glass bottom ride.The simulator was a let down that last around 4 mins, a little cartoon turtle takes you through the aquarium and into the ocean. I expected it to be a real life shark experience! The glass bottom boat ride was OK (but then again we had just been snorkelling in the Maldives so maybe weren't too impressed as a result) You don't get to see that much variety either , a few huge rays but they are quite deep below but mainly a few species of medium fishes that swim right under the glass)The big Wow was walking through the tunnel as it's pretty stunning and you see a lot of sharks , rays etc We personally would have given the simulator/boat thing a miss but I guess for kids it's another \"fun\" activity.Overall, the walk through tunnel was pretty impressive so I would say take your time and really take it all in.To be fair you see a lot from the outside so if you don't want to pay you do see all the big sharks/rays for free from outside.Seeing the display from the outside is pretty impressive as you don't get that view inside the tunnel. Plus side of being in the tunnel is getting close up to sharks, seeing all the teeth etc, and he obvious of being surrounded by a nicely filled tank of everything ! Overall : must go "

Once inside the tunnel, the first thing that greets you is the astounding sight of grey nurse sharks in the cave section. For us that was worth the entry price alone. We were in the tunnel for 20 minutes just taking it all in. If that was it and there was no more to the visit, we would have been happy. However there was so much more to see. The zoo section was awesome, endless amounts of creatures to look at. Being Aussies we have seen our fair share of crocs, however to get up close to the king croc was a highlight. We also partook of the glass bottomed boat and fish feeding experience which was great - even more exciting knowing all the rays and sharks were just swimming around beneath the boat. The \"Explorer\" simulator experience was a bit of fun - but probably more so for the kiddies. Allow yourself plenty of time - if coming by metro, the walk/travelator just to get to the mall and into the acquarium is around 30 minutes. Allow a couple of hours for the aquarium and another 30 minutes to get back to the metro - and that's a 4 hour outing without even looking in the shops in the mall."

I'm a bit of a marine freak so I'd been meaning to go to the aquarium for a while. There really is an incredible array of marine species which catches you off guard considering you're in a mall. The croc was huge. :-) We went for a little tour which included information on incubation and development of some of the eggs such as the Sharks. I must say that I was impressed with the tour guides. They were really nice and more knowledgeable than even I'd hoped for. My one gripe, which is why it didn't get 5 star is the lack of info on the various species. Although there are labels on the second part of the tour I didn't feel they were particularly well positioned. Specifically in the huge tank there was no explanation (as far as I'm aware) on the various types of sharks, Rays and other fish. This is a shame as they are such beautiful creatures and I feel for the sake of education, fun and conservation there should be a greater awareness of the types of species on show. All in all though a wonderful experience and I'd recommend it for friends or families."

The big croc is a sight to behold and we love the rays - so much in fact that we paid for a 'Ray Experience' where we got to feed them - do it if its in your budget.

My 2-year-old who is typically adventurous cried and didn't like being in the tunnel (he was ok in Singapore, maybe because the tunnel is bigger? not sure). The crocodile in the zoo (2 floors up) was huge but again, I felt it was not worth it.

The fish feeding is a must-do with kids because the fish are huge and many! It's not always the most stroller friendly because of the multi-storey layout and some stairs in a couple of areas. Note that some activities aren't available to smaller kids and pregnant ladies, which you'll find out when buying your tickets. Remember that it's Dubai Mall so be ready for scamming-tourist-prices.

Worth paying for the kids to feed the fish for an extra 10 dihrams. It was the only paid attraction we did in Dubai and it was well worth it. It's situated in the Mall of Dubai which is vast and has wifi and loads of interesting shops & restaurants - I'd schedule a whole day and you can see the dancing fountains and Burj Khalifa on the same complex as well."

Then if you choose, you can have a boat ride (with a glass bottom) above the aquarium itself, whilst being given the opportunity to feed the fishes, is a brilliant opportunity. You get a chance to see the seaworld firsthand looking down into the aquarium, then thereafter walking through the zoo and seeing so many different sea creatures including the biggest crocodile you'll ever see - is amazing, amazing, amazing!"

            "review": "Walking & Snorkeling with the Sharks. As a birthday treat my daughter walked with the sharks and went Snorkeling with the sharks. My daughter went walking with the sharks in order to do this you first have to watch a safety video and we both had to sign a number of times conditions to the fact they didn't accept responsibility if something went wrong. They supply the wet suit and towel. Walking with the sharks you have a helmet on which is continually supplied with air so you can breath normally the glass front allows you to see all the fish around you and the cage is lowered quite deeply so you are submerged. Fish can swim into the cage as there are openings. The diver in the cage with you will take photo's or a video with the camera you can hire and they then give you the SD card. My daughter enjoyed the experience. Snorkeling with the sharks I felt wasn't that great as you can only see the fish at the bottom of the cage (obviously turning your head to the side water enters the snorkel). I removed the snorkel as I can hold my breath for quite some time so I was able to view all round. As the cage isn't full submerged you can surface to take more air. Unfortunately due to the salt water the buoyancy is such that it is very difficult to swim under the water so I floated sometimes like a beach whale. You get about half an hour each but although it was an experience I was a little disappointed in the fact that not any fish can into the cage and the fact you saw more of the fish outside of the cage through the outside viewing area than inside the cage. It isn't cheap in fact quite expensive."

The creatures on display inside the zoo are very rare and from across different regions of the world. The tour starts with the tunnel on the ground floor where you get to see thousands of aquatic animals up close, including sharks, sting rays etc. As we move on the floors above, we see different unique kinds of creatures in separate enclosures, like octopuses, squids etc. Don't miss out on one of the world's largest crocodiles kept inside the zoo. Ticket prices start from 100 AED."

The displays were excellent and there were lots of additional options on the tickets if you wanted. There were a number of staff around the exhibit and they seemed happy to assist. I have to say the Archer fish demo was pretty cool.Well worth a visit especially if you are spending the day shopping.

Something for everyone : for Aussies like us, a giant Australian crocodile, serenaded by a small bunch of kookaburras brought up some rather eccentric memories of home.

We only did the basic tour, there are some super add ons though if you want to see back of house or croc experience. They could do with introducing a family ticket year-round. We were lucky and got the summer pass which was awesome value including cinema, sega world and kidzania, recommended."

The aquarium has many sharks, rays, and all sorts of tropical fish, you walk thru a tunnel in the beginning and it is about two or more stories high. Take your time to walk through so you can see all the different species. Then they have a section where there are tanks of several different fishes, anemones, etc. You also get to go and see how they prepare all of the food for the fish and how they are fed. Everything is made in house and it is quite the production producing all the different foods. Worth going in for a visit."

We chose the explorer package which really for the money was a rip off . A small tunnel and a 4 minute simulator . So we got on the boat which was the highlight off this to us however it ended up being a nightmare ! So we got on the ride and got to the first turn the rope that the driver was holding on to snapped and the boat began to rock , my daughter was terrified . The divers cleaning the tank had to help us get back on track . On the ride there was a British man who started kicking off shouting stressing everyone out . He asked the driver of the boat when was the last health and safety check to the response of a mumble . The British guy started cussing and threatening to kill the tour guide . Luckily we all got off ok . We complained to the manager who didn't even give a formal apologie but said we can have a refund . As we got to the kiosk we explained we needed a refund and the woman said a 150 aed dollar refund for the boat ride but the tunnel and the crocodile weren't included . We eventually got 360 aed cash back . Relectuent for your money but not so much when they have to give it back ."

We waited for 20 minutes in the queue and then went into the tunnel. I didn't realise that the tunnel is all there is for the aquarium then you head upstairs for the zoo part. The tunnel is massive and worth a look but the Zoo on level 2 is much better. The kids really wanted to see the giant crocodile and he didn't disappoint. The fish and the various attractions are great, and a welcome relief from the heat of the day."

The multistory aquarium is captivating and is incredibly inviting. After purchasing tickets, I went through the underwater zoo. Really cool views and tons of photo opportunities. Getting to the aquarium main entrance on the 2nd floor is a little tricky as the flow is not well-defined or easily labeled. Fortunately, friendly staff are able to guide you around. The aquarium as a whole is impressive and the exhibits are well put together. The crocodile and saltwater shark tank exhibits were my personal favorites. The nocturnal animals and the bat exhibit were a close second. Enjoy the photos!"

This aquatic extravaganza is available at 50% off for persons with emirates id card from 9 p.m to 12 p.m. The outside concave view of the aquarium itself is mind-blowing enough to attract person to take a tour of the tunnel which begins with an area dark enough to see the slow movement of the sharks giving you the chills and a \"sleeping with the fishes\" feel. This tunnel takes around 10-15 mins with a chance for some memorable pics.Then starts the zoo tour where you enter into an area showing the botanical features of the sea creatures( boring part) leading further towards a boat ride where the boat is pulled by ropes and one can see the aquarium from the top and the fishes circles the boat for food (feeding comes with extra payment) which shows the entire water network and UV lights which flourish the aquarium.This leads to the latter part where one can see an entire array of fishes starting from the piranha, archer, lionfish, gold fish and many more and a few otters and penguins in their artificial habitat.The next part deals with the under water creatures like seahorses,snakefish and a rope way leading to a dark area boasting about creatures like scorpions,bats and many others which are kind of rare in normal life.The whole experience is a colorful memory of Dubai and no other place exhibits such a vast fauna."

I have to mention that this aquarium is huge with very impressive variety of fish species as well as the beautiful Rays that comes in different sizes.The Underwater Zoo is amazing too with the different varieties but the one that stands out is the King Croc. I can't explain how impressed we were with it's size. The first time my eyes came across it, it took my breath away, a moment that'll stay in my memory for a long time. It left a lasting impression on me. A great survivor from ancient times. That alone was worth every penny we spent. Bottom line, a highly recommended attraction if you happen to be in Dubai."

Different species of Sharks, Ray's and many species of fish as well as penguins!It's a gigantic Aquarium and we paid 120 Dhs pp. This included a small boat ride with a glass bottom and it was a great experience. Easy to buy tickets right there at the mall as there were no ques. Maybe because we visited during the summer! Could be busier in the winter I guess!One thing to take note of is the massive ques for taxis (only available at designated areas). So at mall closing times be prepared folks!"

One of the places you will visit multiple times during your stay is Dubai Mall, whether you like malls or not. We debated whether we wanted to pay money to see \"fish at the mall\" but we got a special. Discounted savings at the Aquarium/Zoo after our tour at the Burj Khalifa. I can't remember the exact percentage off but it was more than 40% and included the highest level aquarium visit. It was like any other aquarium zoo combo and I would have skipped it if we didn't stumble upon the discount. The aquatic life was nothing you couldn't see elsewhere. Something fun to do on a hot day when you don't want to be outside. The staff members were pleasant. They would stop and answer any questions you had about the aquatic life. We did the \"boat ride\" at the Dubai Aquarium which is a circle around the tank and saw one of the largest crocodiles from Australia. Nice time but definitely not a \"do over.\" If you just have to go see if another nearby site is offering discounted tickets. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE. I didn't realize there was an aquarium at The Atlantis before we secured the tickets. I would have much rather toured The Atlantis Aquarium instead based on what we saw during our stop there. Oh well that's my two cents on the subject, you have to decide for yourself."

I was annoyed to see that the booklet had suggestions on how to conserve resources - I did suggest that perhaps not printing off pages of coloured photos would be a good start but I doubt it will do much good.

Then you have to go up to the top floor of the mall to see the rest.I found the aquarium really hard to navigate as you had to keep going back on yourself and there wasnt a clear flow as to where you need to be.We did however pay to go the \"Other Encounter\" my partner didn't pay to go in as he didn't want to but I booked the 6pm slot and no-one else did it so because it was just me they allowed my partner in there aswell which was nice of them.In the encounter you sit on these seats behind a plastic barrier so you can't actually touch the others but you see the trainer play with them and tell you loads of information about them. They have holes in the plastic barrier so you can touch the otters hands and can take photos. It was a nice change to an average aquarium and was fun - I think kids would love the otter encounter as they were so cute!!."

Overall, Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo is compact, not very big but it is a wonderful effort at this scale in the Arabian region of the world. Overall it can take about an hour to complete visit to Tunnel, Zoo and the feeding area. The initial big tunnel is visible even to mall visitors from outside; it is not too big but nicely done and one can see a number of species there. After exit one has to go up two levels in the mall to access the Zoo, feeding area and other attractions. I have visited a few aquariums at different places and in that context didn\u2019t expect too much from this one but must say that it is a creditable, well presented and compact indoor facility created by its developers at a premium mall in Dubai. There are a number of attractions, the biggest being the crocs. Fish feeding area has been done well. You can also touch and feel starfish and crabs in designated areas.  On the flip side I felt that the directions once you are inside should be visible and clearer as in the Zoo area in particular people get confused and miss direction. Also there should be an inner way to go from Tunnel to Zoo rather than the common mall escalators. Some of the enclosures and aquariums could have been bigger but then the credit cannot be denied for a wonderful effort. Both children and adults will enjoy the visit. It is slightly expensive but then they have maintained the same very well which needs to be lauded. Since there are a number of attractions inside Dubai Mall try and check online options or discounted passes at the venue which can help you cover multiple attractions at a lower combined cost."

I was amazed by the sheer size of it and so much was available to view just as a shopper in the mall but when we paid entrance fee and walked through the tunnel then climbed to the second floor and saw the most unusual exhibits we were totally surprised. We saw jelly fish from home that we had never seen before showcased in such a way that we got a really good close look at them. We also saw some really strange looking fish that permanently have their mouths open scooping stuff up. Fascinating! There is a pretty big croc and his partner in there - taken out of Cairns in Qld. The story of their trip is well documented too. Well worth the visit."

You could easily get away with not paying and seeing the aquarium from the outside but it is good value for money to actually go in. Tickets are reasonably priced (200 dirhams, Aug 15) to walk through aquarium then have a tour behind the scenes (probably a publicity ploy to show they're being sustainable). For not much more (can't remember exactly but it honestly wasn't much more) you can feed the fish, or.... get in the tank with the sharks!!! Really amazing experience. After which you can walk through the rest of the aquarium to see King Croc (massive!) and more sea life (I got to touch a starfish!) Then onto the rip-off gift shop - the only downside to the attraction. \u00a318 for a keyring with a picture of you standing inside the aquarium. Not. Worth. It. Take your own camera/phone!But overall, really good value for money to be inches (glass is 7 inches thick, I believe) from amazing sea life. A must see."

It's been built within a shopping mall! Over two storeys in height and about 10 shops long. It's huge and contains an array of beautiful fish including rays and sharks. There are lots of different species of fish in there and you have an opportunity to dive with a professional and hand feed the fish. This wasn't for me but I was very impressed with the way in which this aquarium is built and sited. The fish don't appear to be shy and are swimming about happily. It's as others have said deceptively big. The Perspex tunnel that you can walk through and under the fish is very daunting too. It's not a full half day for this attraction but will easily soak up a couple of hours."

They get pretty aggressive during feeding time so you can tell it's every fish for themselves, they need to reduce the number. Good tour guides."

However at the counter we were given two options you buy ticket with boat ride 120 Aed or 100 without boat. We were told you will enter tunnel then zoo and boat ride, the whole experience will last for an hour. The tunnel journey is for 5-10mins nothing spectacular. You then come out to area where you started queueing up for ticket wondering around for 10mins & so thinking where to go next. You then enter Zoo which has very small quantity of fishes again overall 10min experience nothing special. If you've purchased the boat ticket you will go into stimulator for 5 mins, not for adults at all, you then asked to wait for 15-20mins before you could take the boat ride. We were absolutely disappointed and decided to leave the aquarium and asked for refund.We spoke to manager Hafeez who was extremely rude,we were called a liar in so many words that staff at cashier desk explains the whole experienced therefore we knew before purchasing the tickets. When I challenged this he refused to listen and refund our money in full, refunded 100 dirham only. I'm disgusted the way we were treated was very embarrassing. We've never complained about anything but yesterday was a complete shocking, we were insulted , we've spent a lot of money to come to Dubai to explore sight seeing etc not to be treated like criminal. our expectation was bigger and the price you've to pay is shocking, place is not impressive at all. The giant tank from outside is the most there is to see."

The aquarium is pretty cool - there is a huge tank which is visible from inside the mall to the general public, this contains sting rays, small sharks and many fish. With the ticket you can walk through the tunnel with the tank all above you - this is good, especially for kids! There is then an upstairs section which has more variety such as penguins, King crocodiles, sea horses, jelly fish etc. There are good fact boards about each species so it is good for information too! I would say it is a little expensive for the money but if you're looking for a fun activity (especially for children) around the area it is good!"

Having just returned from a diving trip in the Philippines it was sad to see beautiful sea life that I has traveled around the world to see and did not see them in the wild. The tank in Dubai Mall is filled with beautiful Rays and Sharks. It was sad to realise that part of the reason that I did not see rays in the wild was because they were living in glass boxes in a shopping centres around the world. The tank is over packed and I watched for 10 minutes as the rays were chased constantly by smaller fish biting their tails. It was apparent that they were stressed by the constant chasing and biting. There was a SCUBA diver in the water with a guide and after 1 or 2 minutes the diver starting to panic and was flapping around. He was kicking the fish and was clearly distressed. The instructor had to hold the man still to stop him kicking up the plant life or ascending to the surface. Inexperienced people should not be placed in a tank that full of fish it was clearly overwhelming to have such large fish such as sharks swimming so close. I am not against all aquariums I think they hold great value in educating people about oceans but the tank was too full and the fish were overly aggressive. If you want to see beautiful fish buy a snorkel and mask."

There are a range of packages you can do depending on whether you want to just wander around, have a glass bottomed boat trip around the tank or scuba dive etc. We went for the basic package so this review is based on that alone.Once you pay, you are directed around the tank to the underwater tunnel. This allows you to see the fish from inside the tank. It really allows you to appreciate the sheer size of the tank (and of the fish in it). After you exit the tank you\u2019re directed up to the 3rd floor of the mall where the rest of the aquarium is located. Your journey continues with a tour of the tank from the surface of the water. The tour guide gives you a bit of information about the filtering process, shark preservation and about jellyfish lifecycles. The talk is scripted but informative; our guide did lose his flow at one point and had to start that section again repeating his previous few sentences word for word. You get to stand in a glass box slightly submerged in the tank so that you can feed the fish (costs extra to do so) or just watch everyone else do it. Although feeding the fish sounds exciting to some people, all you do its throw pellets over into the tank and watch the fish swarm so in my opinion it isn\u2019t worth paying for.The rest of the aquarium showcases a range of aquatic life from otters and octopus, to crocodiles. It\u2019s a great opportunity to see a range of bizarre aquatic animals that you may not have seen before.The main attraction of the area is the crocodile that they have named \u2018King Croc\u2019. This huge crocodile has a couple of viewing areas you can have a look from so that you can appreciate how big it actually is. While we visited there was an additional exhibition on nocturnal animals showcasing hedgehogs, bats and more."

It was the largest mall I had eve been to. They had the aquarium incorporated into the mall with a very large wall of water with lots of creatures. As we paid for our tickets and were standing in line we noticed three young men that were not in line for the aquarium staring at my daughter. I asked them to stop following us and staring, but they would not. They aquarium people said there were hippos and such so we were looking for those types of animals, but we never saw them. We did take a little boat ride with a glass bottom so we were able to see the sharks and other sea creatures. We had a very lovely visit, but when we came out the other end those boys/men were waiting. They followed us everywhere even when we went outside to see the water fountain . We had to walk pass them so ask I was walking pass I said I was going to call the Police. They must have gotten the message and left. My daughter is a beautiful 16 year old and did have her shoulders showing. I had been told after this that could have been the issue so be fair warned keep a close eye on your children."

The aquarium in the Dubai mall is something very different and worth a visit if you're there. As we didn't have a change to visit the lost chambers at Atlantis hotel we decided to get tickets for the aquarium. This included entrance to a tunnel which passed under the aquarium, a glass boat ride and underwater zoo. The tunnel was small but gave you an opportunity to get close the fish and sharks. The boat ride was very restricted to a small circle above a small part of the aquarium, I was wondering how they would have fit this in there in the first place. Also didn't see very many fish under the boat itself to take advantage of the glass bottom. The zoo was full of different species of fish, and underwater animals, this was nice to walk through. Highlight was a big alligator. I would say look into the options of the tickets before hand and see if they interest you otherwise it won't be money well spent."

Whilst an aquarium and underwater zoo located in a mall does sounds very niche, considering the vastness of the mall and also the quality of the mall the aquarium and underwater zoo were dissapointing on numerous fronts. Firstly, I loved the tunnel this was very good, however signage to the underwater zoo was appalling and no wonder there seems to be quite a few people who have commented that they thought that it was not value for money just being the tunnel! The quality of the interior of the underwater zoo was poor considering the quality and vastness of the mall and could have been better designed and to a higher standard. In addition I was shocked to see a few of the animals in what I would deem unacceptable space for their breeds and size, namely some 13 beavers in a very small enclosure and also some tanks with much larger species of fish were in my opinion far too small for them and as such they were stationary as no real space to move around.. You then had much larger tanks for much smaller fish.. The 2 crocodiles were also in a very small enclosure. It just did not make sense to me and I then ended up considering the welfare of the animals that I saw rather than enjoy what I had paid for. Granted there were some unusual species there which were interesting to see. So all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the tunnel part but would not pay to return again."

Aquarium of the Dubai mall \u2014 showcases one of the world\u2019s most diverse collections of marine animals with more than 300 species including sharks, rays, giant groupers and massive schools of pelagic fish. You can view quite a lot for free from outside or pay to access the walk-through 270-degree acrylic tunnel, which makes for an incredible close-encounter experience with underwater animals. Tickets also include access to the Underwater Zoo on the 2nd Floor. This is a menagerie of rare and unusual sea dwellers; whose undisputed star is a 5.1m-long Australian crocodile named King Croc. He is 40 years old and weighs 750kg. He's joined by his female companion Queen Croc. \u201cAl Boom Diving\u201d offers various add-on aquatic experiences, including a shark dive and cage snorkeling."

Everything in Dubai Mall is big and shiny but this attraction was a let down. You can literally stand in the shopping area and watch the best parts of the display for free. Why deal with a long queue to walk through an underwater walk way (too short) to then queue again. You are then directed up two floors on an escalator and meander through a crowded and poorly (over lit) series of tanks. The glass is dirty and very scratched. (What are the staff doing?)The large alligator is impressive but looks dead. We almost ran through there just to get out through the gift store. We had been on the red bus / big bus tour the day before and had tickets to the Atlantis (Palms) aquarium included. In my opinion Atlantis aquarium is far better, well maintained and has smaller crowds. The subdued lighting made it more of an under the sea experience."

You could spend a couple of hours going through it. The glass bottom boat ride however was a bust...you are really just floating about the top of the water really slow, in what seems like a circle.

It will most certainly be an unforgettable experience to new or non-divers. The fact that you will be in a tank (albeit a giant one) full of many different species of sharks, can be a bit unnerving, if not crazy, for new divers. The common knowledge however, that sharks are typically shy creatures and tend to avoid human contact, should be of some comfort for the inexperienced. Nonetheless, the Shark Dive program at Dubai Mall is an exhilarating underwater adventure that you can experience in half-a-day, with complete safety and airconditioned comfort."

Walking through these habitats was great and seeing the wide range of sea life was amazing, however, you can also get into the Aquarium! My husband and I were able to do a \"shark walk\" inside the huge aquarium and really become part of the exhibit which was a really neat experience! A guide went down with us and (for an additional fee) took a video with a GoPro during the entire \"dive\" which was a great souvenir! You can also take a ride in a glass bottom boat (if you don't want to get into the water) or you can scuba dive, if certified! Great for families but my husband and I enjoy this attraction without kids too.

We visited the Burj Khalifa and on the way out saw the aquarium and decided to visit the aquarium & underwater zoo we paid 100 AED around \u00a320 each but it was really worth it , you get to see the main aquarium free in the mall it is absolutely massive the diversity of fish and corrals is incredible you walk down the main aquarium and then turn and walk through a long tunnel through the middle of the tank and are inches away from tiger sharks , Ray's and numerous fish .You then go upstairs and look found numerous aquariums with a amazing variance of fish and also see two really large crocodiles about 5 meters long , there are penguins and other birds as well Once you have finished you get a behind the scenes tour which is really interesting , you can pay to do other adventures if you wish you can have a glass bottom boat ride around the top of the main tank , you can feed the Rays and also you can pay to dive in the main tank if you are qualified , there is a lot to do for all ages and budgets you can even see the main tank free in the mall if you don't want to see the rest of the zooAll in all a great half day out at a reasonable price."

The night animals seemed trapped in small cages. Huge crocodile, king croc was great for photos. But a large wall of the aqarium you can see in Dubai mall for free. I'd say if you haven't been to a large scale aquarium before it is worth a visit. Do not miss the second floor where the zoo is!"

So the lady gave us another package at no extra cost ( 50 AED) even though we were in the wrong. I would recommend the explorer package, as the simulator is only exciting if you are under ten years of age. However, the glass bottom boat and the tour to see a gentlemen feed the fish was a brilliant experience. The wast amount of space for the species in the tunnel was lovely. I felt sorry for the King crocodile and his lady as they were big and I would have liked their area to have been bigger.

The aquarium and underwater zoo are stocked with some interesting fish and underwater life, with the giant alligator being quite amazing, alongside the giant crabs. I felt very sorry for the octopus which was almost as big as the tank he was in - criminal to keep it in such a small tank. Dubai aqaurium and underwater zoo you really need to review your \"child\" policy and stop ripping off parents of small children - most decent proprietors charge adult prices from 12/13 years old not 3 (and even then 12/13 is not an adult)!"

A selection of different ticket types are available, offering customized visits to meet your preferences such as snorkeling, diving etc. Make sure that you do not go there when schools are taking the children for a tour.

Wooow...wooow....wooowI cant believe how much this aquarium has changed since my last visit in 2012.Basically back then it was just a simple visit in the tunnel where you admired several types of marine animals swimming in the huge tank.Now, and after 4 years of my last visit, I was really glad to go into that place again.We got the Researcher tickets which basically give you access to the tunnel, the under water zoo, and the behind the scenes experience.The tunnel is widely known to everyone. As for the underwater zoo its a really nice experience zoo like but related to water animals/mammels. As for the last thing its a really impressive matter which you should not miss as you get access to how things at this amazing facility work such as, food preparation, veterinary hospital, water treatment....but the coolest part of the visit was when we got the opportunity to go down to the water level at the aquarium and throwing food to the fish. The part of this visit is a guided tour. Guides are really amazing and answer all ur queries without any hesitation. They are on top of things.One important thing also is that you get to see the giant crocodile laying there in the water...Its majestic !!!Anyone visiting the mall should definitely visit this site and enjoy itPS: you can book ur tickets online just like I did nevertheless, you will have to wait inline at the counter to exchange the e tickets with regular tickets, so basically its a waste of time"

The aquarium itself isn't worth paying for. You walk through a 50m tunnel and the fish etc swim over and next to you. But you can just stand on the outside of the big glass wall and see the same thing. I was disappointed that there was very little live marine vegetation in the tank. The kids liked the underwater zoo because they could observe different small species of marine animals up closer. There could be more labeling of the tanks themselves because to work out what was in the tank you had to move to a digital display and find the fish on the screen for information. It was a nice way to spend an hour if you get tired of the shiny shiny mall."

The part where you learn about the feeding and types of sea animals was very good too. The crocodile section was impressive but the size of the pool area for such a big Croc seemed a bit small bit in fairness the Croc is massive! A small tip too - use the cash register upstairs as it seems to be a lot quieter than the one on the ground floor. Well worth a visit!"

There are 3 different packages you can purchase, we purchased the basis package which allowed you to go through the tunnel, entrance to the under water zoo and a behind the scene tour (cost around \u00a320 each)The tunnel is good fun watching fish, sharks, etc swimming above you (could spend ages in here, just watching the fish). The under water zoo, is an aquarium with lots of different fish, etc, including a creepy crawly section, and a massive crocodile!The behind the cpscene tour last around 20 minutes, and is very interesting talking about how the breed and look after all the fish, etc.Would recommend doing this whilst in Dubai"

I was running a little short on time with only an hour and a quarter left so I picked the 'researcher' tour, at 100AED. It was a great experience and I'm really glad I did it. You start your tour with the towering tank and underwater tunnel. The fish, stingrays and sharks are plentiful. You can see so much going on, especially from inside the tunnel. Then it is up to the second floor for the underwater zoo. WOW! The habitats look great. There are dangerous fish to see, otters, some hairy beavers which were all wet from a recent dip, crocodiles, sea horses, frogs, jellyfish.... The list goes on. My tour also included a behind the scenes look at how the aquarium operates. It was great to get a look out the back and see how baby sharks are born, crocodiles are hatched and the fish fed. The crocodiles were impressive. The whole aquarium is well presented and informative. If you're in the mall dive in to this experience."

You can enjoy this part for free, from a distance though. However, if you pay extra, they let you walk through an tunnel and then get a visit to the under water zoo. The star attraction in the zoo is the huge salt water croc. There are quite a few activities as well that you can do, if you pay up. This includes feeding the sting rays, diving etc. The cheapest paid package, which lets you walk thru the tunnel and visit the zoo, IMHO is a bit expensive at 100 dirhams. All other activities are over priced as well, in my opinion. I have been to bigger and better aquariums for the same cost or may be cheaper. That does not mean this is a mediocre facility. Considering what they have done and how well they have kept this place and being in Dubai, this is a must visit. Just that, IMHO, it may not be all that worth paying up, because you are getting an amazing view of the aquarium from the public viewing place.Would I go back and pay again, NO. Would I go watch from the public viewing area, DEFINITELY YES."

The largest tank is visible from within the Dubai Mal without buying a ticket, but if you buy a ticket you can walk through the tunnel on the inside. The biggest sharks could only be seen well through the tunnel, because they liked to hide out under the rocks. While walking beneath them, you can see rows of sharp teeth inches from your face. The fish like to swim directly toward you, probably because they think you're going to feed them. This allows for some great photos, just be sure to set your camera to shoot through glass and cut glare. Upon exiting the tunnel, you can go upstairs to see the smaller exhibits. This is where things get even more exciting. The very first exhibit is a tank full of piranhas from the Amazon River. If you look closely, you'll notice the bones of some larger animal in the bottom of the tank. The decoration around each exhibit adds to the whole experience. One of my favorite exhibits was the fish that squirt water into the air to knock flies off a food plate suspended over the tank. Be ready to get wet if you visit them during feeding time. There is a large and very active octopus, several species of jellyfish, and giant rats. I elected to do the otter encounter. You can add an encounter to your ticket for a little extra, and you can choose between 3 types. The otter encounter allowed me to go behind the otter exhibit with the zookeepers, where I met Cato and Diego. Those little guys put on quite a show. The zookeepers were extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and you can feed and pet the otters carefully.Before leaving the aquarium, you'll see the King Croc; the largest crocodile in the world. This croc is like the size of a small car! You can get a feeling of how terrifying it would be to run into one of them in the wild. It absolutely looked like Godzillla. The croc was the perfect way to end the visit."

When shopping in the mall it is very temping to pop into the aquarium in order to go through the under-water viewing passageway. The price was 100AED each. The first section of walking through the aquarium is great, amazing view of the sharks and fish in the water so close to you. You get a talk about the feeding of the sharks etc. which doesn't last long but quite informative. I think you can pay extra to actually feed the fish (but didn't seem worth it as you're just throwing it into the tank). Walking around the aquarium you can be as slow or fast as you wish. There are posters of information about each fish etc. and the range is very impressive. The large crocodile, penguins and octopus stood out to me. Great to do at any time of the day with friends and family. There are little coffee areas as you walk round if you need a rest! I would recommend but not more spectacular than other aquariums around the world (apart from it being inside a mall!)."

There are several fee level, I paid for the glass bottom boat ride & the underwater simulation. I thought the simulation will be similar to the Legoland Windsor attraction which had the small submersible go into the tank. No, it's just animation - it can only be enjoyed by small kids. The boat ride was worth it. For 10 aed you can feed the fish, which my kids did. The lady guiding the boat knows her stuff and was accommodating.We stayed for the crocodile feeding. I recommend you go to the Mezzanine Level where (IMHO) the view is better. I will not recommend the \"crocodile experience\". You don't get to feed the croc yourself, you will only feed the birds in the enclosure, unless that's what you want."

Then you have to take an escalator or lift upstairs to the 2nd floor to continue. There are water rats, otters and many other fish to see, plus and night animals section and an enormous crocodile (which we found pretty funny as he just lies there doing nothing whilst they play a rahhhh noise sound track to make him scary) he probably would be scary if he got mad though.

You go to the front desk and get tickets for what experience you want and the aquarium and underwater zoo are a package. Many people are standing outside to look and take pictures instead of going in as they can also see the fish from outside, but being inside and seeing them from either side and on top of you is a nice experience. They take your picture once you go in and they have it in a frame and ask you if you want it after you leave. I do not know how much it costs as I did not take mine. The most prominent fish to see are the sharks and the stingrays as they swim around the aquarium. It is a very short walk, so you can finish in about 10 minutes if you stop to take pictures and videos. If you are really into it, you can stay for as long as you wish, but I think I finished in 10 to 15 minutes. The underwater zoo was nice with a lot of different types of fish, frogs, and turtles. The sea turtles were my favorite to watch. This is a nice family activity. I went alone, but it seemed that families with younger children were enjoying it the most as the children were so excited and curious."

Without buying a ticket you can see most of the fish from within the mall, the ticket gets you access to the underwater tunnel which gives you a closer look at the fish. Very impressive, but was maybe expecting a little more from the Aquarium.After leaving the tunnel you have to go up two flights of escalators in the mall to the underwater zoo. This was a great way to spend an hour, so many different types of animals and fish and the habitats that they have created was stunning.Check out the King Croc - definitely one not to be missed.The only down side is that you are in the middle of the Dubai Mall and have to walk a long way to get to the taxi rank, otherwise very good."

This one, as compared to those, is average, and comparatively smaller. Does have a wide variety of fishes, and what made is worth while was the giant croc it has - we were in awe when we saw it. Try to go there around 330 in the afternoon so that you can see the feeding of penguins, and then at 4 the croc feeding. Recommended purely for the croc."

For the cost and the simple fact that it is in the middle of a mall, it is well worth the trip."

I felt that the attraction started off slow but once you had completed your visit there was a lot packed into the ticket. I wish that I had paid for the full ticket with the behind the scenes laboratory visit. One starts the experience by paying your money for the ticket then you walk around the outside of the Aquarium feeling a little cheated as all the non paying people were seeing the same as you. turning the corner at the end you walked back through the tunnel. OK is that it I asked. then you had to leave the attraction and go up stairs (Top Floor) to the submarine simulator - Not too impressive. then you are moved into the waiting area for the glass bottom boats (Perspex not Glass) Once you tour around the top of the aquarium that is it. I was left with wanting more and feeling slightly short changed. Perhaps I should have purchased the full behind the scenes ticket where you have the opportunity to go into the lab and speak with the scientists. The attraction lacks that \"Disney Razmataz\" if you know what I mean."

It depends what ticket you get but all ticket holders as I remember gets to go through the tunnel. After the tunnel I had the Explorer ticket which allowed me the tunnel, simulator, aqua zoo and the glass bottom boat, so we went to the zoo after which was strangely on the second floor so we had to leave the area go up an external escalator then find the zoo which I found odd but we found it quite easily after asking for directions. So when we arrived at the zoo there were three different tiny tanks and then we went on the simulator which I must say was aimed at aged 6 and below. So after that we got confused thinking the whole zoo was just the three tanks so we weren't impressed. After we went down stairs and put in a life jacket without assistance so everyone including little children were just yanking off the closest jacket to them but after that the glass bottom boat was by far the best part as the lady who gave us a tour was very informative and knowledgable of the aquarium, impressive. So when we got off we were directed into another gift shop (by then this was the third I think) then it carried on to the rest of the zoo which I was pleased about. The rest of the zoo was inexplainably outstanding any fish you could name it had and alligators, owls, frogs and so many creatures I've never even heard of! AMAZING"

Under 3s were free. This included a talk at the beginning showing how they looked after the fish etc... And then access to the underwater zoo.We loved the jellyfish, sharks, rays, crocs. There was only one place where you could touch anything, but we did (starfish). Best bit for the kids was the crocs, but I liked the frogs, and penguins too.We spent just over an hour in there.

Please move to the next section so the other group can have space to stand.\" Smh). It's a bit smelly down there but hey, what should I have expected here :D. Lastly, it's super expensive to buy a printed and branded picture from there. I know itwa tourist destination but gosh! The positives: it is absolutely stunning and beautiful. The glasses that house the sea creatures are like magnifying glass so you get some extremely detailed views. It's breathtaking. There's also a kinda creepy but awesome section with desert animals, bats owls, rats, lizards etc. I enjoyed squinting my eyes in the dark to find those critters. Finally, if you're not from sub Saharan Africa (which is where I am from) , and you've never seen a Nile Crocodile before(Um, I've seen a great number), then you'll be utterly petrified lol, maybe, but also awe-struck by the ones there. Particular mention to the King Croc (affectionately termed), it's humongous. You'll love it!"

The zoo houses a lot of marine creatures like jelly fish, crocodile, tortoise, sea horse, star fish, crabs, penguins, etc. The crocodile is a really big one imported from australia weighing around 750 kg and still growing at 40 years of age.

We were fully briefed about shark behaviour and rules of the dive with regard to controlling buoyancy and breathing by both written booklet and watching a short video. The kit was great and our instructor, Lito, was knowledgeable, skilled, patient and attentive. He used a Go-Pro camera to film our experience which was an amazing added extra and well worth it to relive the memory since coming home. Diving with the rays, sharks and array of species in the aquarium was a once in a lifetime experience. We moved through the tank guided by our instructor, stopping to rest on the bottom and on strategically placed rocks to enjoy our surroundings whilst being filmed and having pictures taken which was watched by hundreds of people watching us from the Mall. Truly unforgettable and well worth the money (With Go-Pro / filming the cost was approx. \u00a3330 for 2 including free entry to the Underwater Zoo afterwards) and a shark dive certificate at the end which was a lovely touch. A very unique and special experience made so easy by the professional team at Al Boom! Aside from recommending this experience, we dived with Al Boom also in Fujairah and they are exceptional in all aspects of kit, care, knowledge, skill and attentiveness. What made this experience so special and amazing for the shark dive was that we may or may not see these species in their natural environment on future dives, but we will never see them and be able to learn from and enjoy them altogether without having done this. The free entry to the Underwater Zoo afterwards finished the experience off perfectly! Truly amazing!!! Thank you to Lito and Al Boom..."

            "review": "Reasonably Priced Fish and some Bored Staff. I personally found the aquarium in the mall to be pretty good overall, and not too prohibitively expensive, which surprised me. The engineering alone behind this feature is breathtaking, with two stories of window stretching up from the floor, housing 300 sharks and rays as well as a myriad of other fish-type creatures.You dont need to pay to go into the aquarium to see the fish - you can just as easily stand in the mall and watch them swimming and undulating by for free. If you do want to see them a bit closer up, there are some different package options available.The \"researcher\" ticket goes for 100 AED (about 20 british pounds) entry and allows you to go through the underwater tunnel; see behind the scenes and go into the underwater zoo. The next package up is the \"explorer\" ticket (120 AED) and includes the above, plus a glass bottomed boat tour and submersible experience. There are a couple more options above this that include different configurations on the theme of fish and water, including cage diving, close-up animal experiences and scuba lessons at a mere 2,500 AED. The website has more detalls.We took the most basic researcher package because, actually, the submarine experience looked a bit naff and something of a side show. Also, the boat would have just been looking at the same stuff from a different angle, but we saw a boat leaving and the passengers seemed well kitted out with life jackets and excited kids. Other reviews didnt seem too enamoured by the boat, though.In total, the researcher package took us around 1.5 to 2 hours to do and i felt this was worth it.The tunnel was pretty good, but can clearly get quite packed. Its around 50m long running along on the bottom of the tank, so that you get to see close up the sharks and rays swimming by. Many of them rest on top of the perspex so you can see their mouths and gills flapping around, so its educational and there are alot of selfies being taken. The sharks were congregating at one end when we visited so we felt very close to them and their teeth and you can get some interesting pictures if you can figure out how to focus past the glass. There were quite a few people here using flash photography, but if this bothered any of the fish, they didnt show it and had opportunity to get away. Many of them, it seemed, quite liked the attention.The behind the scenes tour was a disappointment and the reason the attraction dropped a star in my review. We were whisked as a group into what appeared to be either a giant laboratory or an ice cream factory and advised that the tour would take about 15 minutes. In a rather rushed introduction by a rather humourless guide, we were told it wouldnt be advisible to slip and fall into the shark tank; we should stay together a group while being passed baton-style from station to station around the lab and were welcome to ask any questions at any time. She then gave a bored and hurried glance around the group and muttered \"any questions, no?\" before shooshing us onto the next guide and repeating the whole zestless speech again for following group. The next guides were somewhat the same, albeit with a different fish speciality and i just felt in the way as they burbled through their lines. I didnt really get the chance to ask any questions, since i couldnt hear a word anyone was saying, and was honestly glad when it was over.The underwater zoo, thankfully, was much better. Plenty of both fresh and salt water fish, well presented and laid out in a thoughtful and interesting way. Lots of conservation information, including reference to CITES (trading convention on endangered animals) and description of the natural habitats in both Arabic and English. There was a touch pool where you can reach down and pick up the starfish and some very weird-feeling horseshoe crabs. There were also some more traditional zoo-type animals, such as water rats, otters, penguins, a couple of enormous crocs, owls, beetles, chameleons, octopus, cuttlefish, moray eels, bats, spider crabs and some australian frogs. My only criticism of the zoo was that i thought the owls and the bat (surely more than one?) could have done with alot more room (which i fed back to them via the e-invitation to do so at the end) and that the otters could have had a few more playthings.Saying that, though, the animals looks healthy and interactive. Although there is a video paying of them catching the croc and i did wonder whether they were still actually allowed to ship in live animals like this from the wild. Being a member of WAZA, also, gave me some confidence in the place, so overall i would give this a good review. However, have to say the tropical \"soundtrack\" blasting out in the background (didgeridoos and kookaburras) gave me a huge headache and they could easily have turned this down since it sounded a bit like a bad rave track.I think the first package was enough and probably wouldnt bother with any of the others, but if you are bored of shopping and feel like a couple of hours in a different world, the aquarium is worth a visit.\""

Even more thrilled was I when i read about the different encounters you can have & we picked the king croc encounter which i regreted afterwards. we could go inside and watch from the top how they feed the crocs. i just feel the encounter they offer wasnt that special especially since it wasnt exactly cheap. We couldve seen the feeding from the outside, it wouldnt have made a big difference. In the encounter included was feeding the birds that were inside which wasnt that special either. I couldve done that in any other country. I just felt like its totally overpriced for what you get. The staff giving us the info was friendly though."

You only got to see the bottom of the aquarium from the Mall. Assumed that you paid 1 price and got everything but the pricing was confusing. Also you had to leave one section and go down 2 floors and find the next entrance for the other section. Sometimes felt a bit 'herded' rather than being able to wander. Amazing variety of animals though, penguins, otters, water rats, rays, squid, crocodiles, turtles, sharks, bats and obviously fish"

One tip that I would give would be to wash your hair afterwards. They do provide showers for you to clean up afterwards but I didn't wash my hair since it was only slightly wet and we still had some shopping to do afterwards.Pretty much for the rest of the day all that I could smell was fish leftovers and salt water.

Access is very easy since it is located inside the Dubai Mall and the metro service will take you directly to the mall. I took the Researcher Experience ticket for 100 AED. It was definitely a good choice and worth the price. We had an extremely nice and enthusiastic guide. She went an extra mile to show and tell us everything about the Aquarium and answered all our questions. The rest of the visit was on our own, without a guide so we could take all the time we needed to observe all the animals. Beautiful and great experience, especially for families."

The underwater zoo is actually very good, with a guide who explains their breeding programmes for creatures such as seahorses. A really pleasant visit!"

We decided to dive elsewhere in the ocean in the end. Get yourself a cupcake from upstairs from Lola's cupcakes where the seating is the near the aquarium glass and enjoy the view for less than \u00a310 and a full stomach to go with it.

We live in Dubai and have an annual visit to the Aquarium especially on those hot humid days as we tend to spend our few rainy days outside making the most of it. There is lots to see and they keep adding attractions to it every year.You can just walk around the outside of the aquarium and will get a good view of the divers cleaning the tank and this is free. You can just buy a ticket for the shark tunnel, skip all the business and crowds of people if you do this as they usually arent queuing just looking. Or you can buy an aquarium ticket with the shark tunnel. We have done the glass bottomed boat trip and the fish feeding both worth it as the children get to see so much. The glass bottomed boat is not in a vast amount of space but the children get up close and personal with the fish. I usually let my 3 rush their way round it knowing I will catch up with them at the cave style glass globe which they can crawl into and be part of the fishes scenery.We then usually backtrack through and take a good look at everything once their excitement of being in there has diminished. Upstairs is bugs and a mini forest again good for the legs to let off a bit of steam. It is probably one of the only place in Dubai where the gift shop is situated before you can actually exit but no fear there are bits and bobs of memorabilia you can pick up for the 30 dhs mark - around 5 UK pounds.My favourite is the otters and the enormous crabs. You can spend as long as you want in here and do not feel pressured to buy extra extra extra. Again the 2 for 1 entertainment book vouchers are great and it keeps the costs down.So much more to do after in the mall itself and if you time this well you can get the free fountain show in the early evening."

            "review": "One of the most interesting places to visit while in Dubai.. To me the Dubai aquarium and underwater zoo is one of the most interesting places to visit in Dubai.There are many advantages of the venue - family or solo, paid or free, while shopping or dedicated visit - the aquarium offers unique experience and enjoyable time to spend. Just stopping outside the enormous window glass, watching hundreds of not thousands of sea creatures wandering in the waters, makes you to forget everything around. Special attraction is the feeding time when divers feed the sea creatures. For those willing to spend some reasonable fee the joy proceeds with entering the underwater tunnel. The view of sharks and skates just a centimeters away is unforgettable. With the same ticket you can proceed to the upper level into the zoo where many of us for the first time meet the cute penguins, the dangerous piranhas and many more known and unknown water animals from different corners of the world. I saved for the next visit to try the raft with transparent bottom. And for the bravest and able to do it and to spend more an aqualung dive is on offer. To me the aquarium rivals as experience the Burj Khalifa observation desk visit. Luckily they are next to each other and compliment one another."

The Aquarium can be seen from outside without paying anything, so naturally the question arises why anyone should pay 100AED to just go through the tunnel. This was the question we had when we finally said \"lets see what the 100AED offers extra\" and we were impressed with what it did.First - Yes, you can see the aquarium from outside and appreciate it, but you cannot get near enough to click meaningful photos. Second, the tunnel experience is so different and unique to justify the ticket price. It is indeed spectacular to see the sharks swimming just about 3 feet from you. You can even see the sharks and rays from their under-side and the feeling is literally as though you are in a glass enclosed submarine. Third - The underwater zoo is brilliant with a huge octopus and not to be missed - King Croc - the monstrous crocodile. So, if you can spare 2 hours, I recommend to buy tickets and enjoy the aquarium, if you are in a hurry then don't waste the money!We took the explorer package priced at 100AED per person and entered the tunnel. The tunnel provides a close view on the swimming fishes, sharks and rays and provides ample photo opportunities. Be mindful that there is a blue tinge in the tunnel and make sure to apply the correct WB correction to photos. It is a wonderful experience to get so close to the fishes and fully appreciate the marine life. We could see divers feeding and cleaning the aquarium. The tunnel is short but it took us a lot of time to cover it as we were lost in the water-world. Exiting the tunnel, you have to get to the second floor where you are taken to the top of the aquarium and the staff explain some interesting facts about the aquarium along with a live demo of how the fishes are fed. You can see incubators, food processing bays, shark feeding cages, etc. and learn a bit more on how this huge aquarium is managed. This tour takes about 10-15 mins and then you are sent to the Underwater zoo area in second floor.The underwater zoo is a collection of various aquariums with different types of sea animals for display. There are very different kinds of fishes, turtles, otters, frogs, crabs, etc. It is a treat to watch so many colorful fishes and sea animals. Do not miss the KRACKEN - A huge Octopus - we were allowed to touch and feel the tentacles - that was amazing! The highlight of the underwater zoo is the monstrous King Croc. It is 5 meters in length and weighs 500 Kg. The Crocodile is enormous and there is a queen croc as well. This is the most crowded place and the last attraction in the zoo. It is almost unbelievable that such a giant creature even exists today. The croc is fed around 4pm so, it is worthy to be around at that time.Dubai Aquarium is very different from the Lost chambers aquarium at the Hotel Atlantis. Both are unique and offer different experiences. Many people (including us) are confused which is better, but honestly if you are going with kids, then I recommend to include both in your itinerary. Reserve at least 2 hours for the Dubai Aquarium and 3 if you also want to include the glass bottom boat."

Our afternoon at the Dubai Aquarium And Underwater Zoo went 'swimmingly' (excuse the pun on words haha) - the ground floor Aquarium Tunnel corridor where we began, made us feel as though we were swimming with the 15' -18' or so swaying Sharks, majestic Rays, and several superb specimen of healthy and sometimes 'curious' fish - Up two flights of escalators was the underwater Zoo where a glorious afternoon was spent watching the Otters playing, the bright yellow fish fry swimming spontaneously while being separated but next to their parents, the large alien looking crabs, the colourful jellyfish and a myriad of other sea life and water creatures. The climate of the day was the family of Crocodiles - Dad was said to be about 30' long and at a mature 40 years of age he turned out to be a bit of a 'Sugar daddy' as his life partner whom had just become the proud parent of 12 little baby crocs, was herself said to be 80 years old!! The Mother croc had one eye open as if 'keeping an eye on me' while I filmed three of her offspring cutely fighting each other for the heat lamp ! How delightful they all were! The animals where all well kept and in an appropriate environment for their natural habitat - The tanks were well maintained and we saw some frogmen in their diving suits swimmIng IN the Aquarium with the Sharks in order to suck up the debris at the base in order to keep the water at the correct levels : A real MUST DO in my opinion folks - especially if you appreciated The Animal Kingdom as I do - EnjoyEven if you don't enjoy the 'Animal' stuff, the Dubai Mall in which the Aquarium and zoo is situated, is also well worth a trip with all it's Designer shops and International Cafes. Hope you have a glorious time \u2728"

Well, if you're in the Mall with your family, taking a shopping ride or simply looking around at the nice fancy shops.. go there, but prepare your wallet. Too expensive? No, but.. And whenever we place a \"but\", some doubts stayed in your mind. If they stayed, for sure they had a reason. :)The place is very nice and you can see grand part of it, outside. Prices?Between Eur 25 (Usd 28) and Eur 49 (Usd 55).. per person.Guys, i like very much to see fishes (my father was a fisherman) but to pay Eur 75 for 3 persons?.. i prefer to go to a nice restaurante and eat the fish! If my son wan to see a fish alive? Well, i pick up one from the river and give it to him or simply go to the nearest Aquarium in my hometown! :)Cheers"

After passing through the aquarium you are directed to check out your photo and then take the escalator up two floors to the zoo. This wasn't signposted very well and it took us a while to find the entrance. The \"zoo\" part is very well done, and the fish and other creatures are very visible. I had to laugh at the info sign for the kookaburras, stating that they were native to \"Papua New Guinea, Australia, and Tasmania\". Well worth the visit, perhaps next time we will upgrade to the explorer section."

We chose to pay for tickets and we do not regret it.Walking inside the tunnel where only centimeters divide you from open mouth of a shark is unforgettable experience. My kids were both scared and excited -and not only them. That comment comes from experienced diving family :)It is also worth to take the trip by boat for little extra on the top and see the zoo.We did not dive with sharks due to limited time, high cost and my wife protests :) for me wanting to take the kids diving with us :) but seeing divers inside next to sharks was also experience. Let me just say after walking through tunnel I agreed with my wife that asking for diving with kids among the sharks was a bit too much to ask her for :)If you like under water animals you will love the place - and sharks are of course top interest. Do not miss 750 kg croc :)If you are not sure, you can check out aquarium by peeking from outside for free - and then decide but in my opinion if you can afford it- it is one of best things to see in Dubai. We did not wait in line at all. You can also combine it with Burj Khalifa and Fountains."

We purchased the Researcher ticket which entitled us to a walk through the underwater tunnel, a view of 'Behind the Scenes of the Aquarium, and a visit to the Underwater Zoo. It was quite scary to walk through the tunnel and come literally face to face with a shark and to see its rows of razor-sharp teeth. The Rays were beautiful and the size of the Groupers was amazing. The Behind the Scenes Tour was very interesting and a pleasure to see what care they are taking to look after and breed the fish. There is even a hospital and maternity ward - but visiting hours were over! The underwater zoo was well laid out with close ups of beautiful tropical fish, giant rays and other fish. The highlight was another close encounter, this time with 'King Croc\" a 5m Crocodile that had been brought over from Cairns Australia. The sheer size and power of this animal is awe inspiring. My only reservations were the Otter and the Beaver sections. I felt that the Otters were trying to find a way out of their concrete environment. They had water to swim in but I felt that there could have been some grass or plants to make it seem more like home. I also felt that there were too many beavers for the size of tank - bearing in mind that their native habitat is the woods and rivers of North America."

Seeing the rays and sharks so close by is an amazing experience and this is richly enhanced by the various exhibits on the upper levels. The backstage tour was a little disappointing as you were passed very rapidly from guide to guide at virtually every the stations that showed how fish were farmed and fed. The Aquarium was a welcome relief from all of the miles and miles of shops, you get much more from going inside than just gawping at the huge tank from the concourse of the Mall and is pretty reasonable value for money given many of the exhibits."

The only downturn is the crowd which makes the experience a bit daunting and noisy. We also entered the section reserved for marine life. The space is somehow tight so chlostophobics have to be careful before venturing in especially in high season. At the end of the section a huge croccodile is displayed in a pool which gave great joy to my 6 years old son. A unique experience in the region which should not be missed."

Both Johan and I never had been in Dubai before, so we choose for the eight hour linger in Dubai.We checked on the internet if you could leave the airport and how far the city centre was. Should we take the metro, a taxi or should we book a touristic bus ride on these double decker busses? We choose the last option. Already on Madrid airport we checked the rates Citysightseeing Dubai was asking. For a 24 hours \u201chop on \u2013 hop off\u201d ride they charged 240 AED per person, which is around 60 euros. With this ticket you did not have to pay an entrance fee at the Dhow cruise boat, the Abra water taxi, all kind of museums and included an audio commentary in 12 languages. When we bought our tickets we got also a free entrance for the Dubai Aquarium, which was normally only offered at the 48 hour ride.We stopped at two shopping malls: The Dubai Mall for a coffee and a visit at the aquarium and at the end at The Mall of the Emirates.We definitely wanted to have a little peek at the beach to see The Palm, an island built in the sea by Dutch engineers.On our way to the Atlantis Hotel, where you can swim with dolphins, we got stuck in traffic because of a car which was on fire.So driving back from The Palm we really had to hurry to the airport. We hopped off at the Emirates mall and got on the metro, which was going much faster than the tour bus. When we wanted to pick up our backpack which we had left at the luggage drop off, there was a big line. Finally when we went through customs we were exactly on time. All the gates of the flights leaving before our flight were already closed. At least, we thought! On a sign was written that going to our gate would take 19 minutes.\u201cWhat \u2026 19 minutes?? How is that possible? We should run!!\u201d I shouted to Johan.The reason was: we had to take a train bringing us to the gate. So running faster would not help. But we made it just in time!Would we do the longer stop over again?Dubai is a beautiful city in the middle of the desert with a great skyline. But we would not book an eight hour stop over again. We have seen all those beautiful buildings now and this holiday we could not do any shopping, because we are traveling light with a backpack. Or we should stay one night there to see the city by night.But the Citysightseeing of Dnata is worth it\u2019s money if you can visit all the attractions. So with a hotel night in Dubai we would book it again."

If you want the free experience, the aquarium is visible from the mall. However, we bought tickets to go through the tunnel, see the underwater zoo, the submarine experience, and the simulator.The simulator is a waste of money. If you have been to Disney World, you have experienced way better simulators. The tunnel itself is not bad. Its fairly small, but you get to see the Tiger Sharks, different fish, and sting rays. The underwater zoo was worth the experience as well with penguins and alligators. However, the staff managing the simulator and submarines do a bad job of managing lines. There were people who were behind us who boarded the boat before us. When we asked them, they said something about only 10 people allowed in a boat etc. Either way, the 20 minute wait is not worth the experience.Overall, I would just pay for the tunnel experience that comes with underwater zoo. I would avoid the simulator and submarine experience."

I have been to the Underwater Aquarium in Singapore, so was not sure if to visit this one or not, coz from the outside this looked puny and I thought not much would be different coz after-all both are aquariums, but my thoughts changed once I reached the counter to purchase the tickets.This place is very unique.First of all some advice:1.Advice to Save Money: But the Entertainer Book : This book would give you coupons from which you can save 50% on entry tickets : This book is available in almost all supermarkets or boo/gift stores also you can purchase it via App (even save more money then).2. If you have time + you are lucky - Do book the scuba slot. You would get to fish in a tank full of sharks, and mind you, I am not talking about the baby sharks, here the sharks are pretty huge unlike Singapore. I was not lucky enough to get a slot.3. Don't take the most basic package, take the one level above that at-least.So the underwater aquarium is very small when you compare it with Singapore, but the fun begins when that part of the tour ends. You would notice a lot of sharks but unlike Singapore, the ones here are huge. After that they take you to the Top of the Aquarium where you can sit on a glass boat and take a tour from the above. So basically when the different species of fish swim underneath you, thats a whole new experience. After this ends there is this whole mini fish zoo which they have. To add the icing on the cake, they got 2 full grown crocodiles inside plus their small foot long kids."

In 2nd level, you'll sit in a boat to take a short tour of aquarium (10-15 minutes) with guide and there you'll get food to feed to fishes.They offer diving also in aquarium to see sharks and other fishes. This dive is totally safe as they'll put you in a cage while doing diving. I'm not sure if they offer dive without cage also.Once you are done with above activity, you can move to other area of this aquarium where you'll see almost all species of aquatic mammals and the giant crocodile."

I'm a sucker for free stuff so we were straight off the bus at the Dubai mall to use these freebies. And I'm so glad we did as it was a really enjoyable couple of hours.It's not hard to find the aquarium as it is sign posted from every area within the mall and once you near it you definitely can't miss it. The huge aquarium tank sits inside the mall by the shops and crowds often gather at this spot just to marvel at the size of the tank. It is an impressive site and is worth a quick look even if you don't fancy going inside. The start of the aquarium is probably the best part of you do choose to pay the entrance fee as this is the huge shark enclosure that you can walk through via the immense tunnel. This is there for the area wherein everyone is trying to capture that perfect photo so it does get a little busy but once you're through this section the crowds thin and you can enjoy a relaxing stroll around the tank enclosures. The aquarium is pretty much like any other aquarium. All the usual water life is on display. Although there were a couple of exotic creatures that I'd never seen before. It's done quite well too with a tree house style walkway in one section and octopus creatures dotted around the walls. There is also the main attraction of King Croc which is basically the biggest crocodile in captivity and possibly in the world. If you like aquariums or wildlife in general then this place is for you but it's basically the same as other aquariums I've visited so wouldn't necessarily top my to do in Dubai list if I was pushed for time.Definitely one for the kids or if you've got plenty of spare time after doing the Burj and the bus tour."

It is nice, but you can see the tank in the mall without paying the ticket price. Up a level is the Underwater Zoo. Your \"behind the scenes tour\" that is included in your ticket price is first. I didn't enjoy it. Our guide read facts to us while trying to keep us together as a group and shuttle us quickly through. It would have been much more enjoyable to look and wander on our own. I was thankful I didn't pay for the glass bottom boat ride when I saw it. You are on a boat that is pulled through the water in a circle by a guide rope. The Underwater Zoo saved the day for me.

The circular boat ride at the top of the tank was gimmicky and pointless really, all you saw was grouper fish and it went round the circuit and that was it.....pure pointless waste of time and effort. The zoo part was alright I suppose and it was great to see King Croc, if not the biggest croc in the world- worth it but he did nothing apart from moving a yard or so. Not the better mall as the Lost Chambers is better in my opinion.The free bit is all you need to be honest."

You can have take photos on the outer side of the giant aquarium without even buying a ticket but then you'll deprive yourself of the amazing inside aqua world. Even more enchanting than aquarium is the Underwater Zoo which is just Wow! With so many species of underwater creatures one simply cannot help feeling awed. You can also enjoy a boat ride on top of the huge aquarium and see the fish from above from a glass-bottom boat, touching the water on your sides :)Tip: Don't pay for feeding the fish... It's not like feeding the fish by actually going inside the water. They only give you a small box of fish feed n you drop it from above. Plain boring! Also, don't get trapped by the photographer(s) while entering teh aquarium. It's not worth taking an expensive photo with a plain wall in the bg."

Firstly it was a great time to visit, no queues at all, we walked straight in and made our way through the 'tunnel' where you view the aquatics. Then made our way to the underwater zoo, which was a hit with our girls. Lots to see , they touched a starfish and put their heads in the mouth of the crocodile ( not real of course) made their way over the rope bridge and had a really good time. You finish with the gift shop, normal stuff on offer, not too badly priced. Overall I'm pleased we did it, was happy with the price we paid (with a voucher) not sure I would want to,pay any more.

Like everything I found in Dubai attractions like the aquarium were larger than life. I will always marvel at sea life and being able to walk under and around it. I won't say that this was the best aquarium I've been to but it's certainly worth a look. I think that kids would be overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the aquarium and the fact that it's part of the shopping mall. Worth the look if you take the time to experience without rushing."

I think anybody from any age could enjoy him- or herself.What adds to the experience is that there are a few options which could be included in your ticket. Diving, a \"cinematic\" experience, feeding the fish...it's all possible and really adds to the experience.I would say to definitely go see the aquarium when visiting Dubai, it's one of the interesting spots in Dubai."

The whole aquarium was loud and overcrowded, definitely not a serene place to relax and watch the fish swim. However if you are a family with kids looking for a change of scenery in the mall, it a great to see many different species of fish and turtles.

You should use an entertainer voucher if you're a group as the ticket price is quite pricey depends on what kind of trip you'll take. The first trip is the big aquarium where you can take some pictures outside then you'll enter the tunnel of the aquarium which is kinda scary as it is a bit small and there's a lot of people inside. But it s awesome to see the sharks in a closer view. At the end of the tunnel you can also buy the pictures/ souvenirs taken by their photographer. They also offer a jungle-like restaurant but it is close during that time. Then you'll head to the 3rd floor where they have different activities and depends on the ticket that you bought. We had a boat ride at the top of the aquarium where you can also feed the fish. There's a bit of hesitation here as the boat's flooring is made of glass. After the boat ride, they'll have separate tanks for different kinds of fish, turtles, and animals. Quite informative as they even put the scientific names of each animals. The main attraction is the king croc whic is really scary! The only wall that's protecting you is the thick glass with some scratches probably done by the king and queen itself. They also have penguins there and upstairs are the night animals. Quite interesting for kids and overall, it is good for a quick view but not worthy to come back again."

Then you go up two flights to stand in an interminable line for the glass bottom boat ride inside an indoor fish tank (my 4 year old loved it, everyone else was bored stiff). But the best is last, when you finally get into the various aquarium exhibits (that may be available separately for people who eat at the Rainforest Cafe, not sure. Anyway in these exhibits the star attraction is a 5 meeter long crocodile that is amazing but plenty of other exhibits to see, definitely the last is best, but not better than most other aquarium exhibits I've seen. There is none of the usual starfish, sand dollar, touchy feelies for the little ones nor any vignettes or anything like that, but lots of colorful fish, could probably get the same effect going to a good pet store (except for the Cairns croccie.)."

A lot of animals on display. Great service too, we could skip the queue because paying by credit card. So the attraction overall is definitely interesting, but the main issue we felt is that there are too many animals squeezed in way too little space. For the small fish it's ok, but it was a painful display to see larger animals who would normally roam large distances constrained in tiny spaces for their size (the crocodile, the owls, even the big octupus..). I understand the real estate space is costly for the mall, so i would recommend reducing the number/ type of animals in display by trnsferring them to more appropriate facilities and put all of them in more decent / spacious conditions. This way it can become a better and more educational venue than it is now!"

The aquarium had a fantastic variety of displays but many of the tanks had no names and no information sheets on them, so we were left wondering what many of the fish were and where they came from. The most amusing thing was the behind the scenes tour, one lady started the tour and told a group of twelve of us pretty much nothing and ignored us while we looked at a tank of baby sharks with no idea why, then handed over to another lady who yelled at us that they grow algae but not why and then just left us standing there with no instruction as to what to do next, we left having learnt nothing. It's still worth checking the aquarium though."

The ticket also included the boat ride and a subliminal submarine ride . As other reviewers have said the tunnel wasn't overly amazing and lasted for 30 minutes if that. You basically just walk through the tunnel and see majority of sharks and sting rays, which you can briefly see from the outside display . The best parts come after when going onto the next level upstairs. The first thing is the subliminal ride , where you step into a machine which takes you on a very short animation journey where you are standing inside . The animation here was good but the machine ride again was not the best , it could be more innovative. Maybe have people sitting down and do it in 3D would have been better .After this was the glass bottom boat ride, this was ok. You wear a life jacket and it goes around the pool like area for around 5/7minutes and you can see the fishes underneath . Once this was done we went around the underwater zoo and this was brilliant , getting to see all the different species of animals , from bats, to lizards , to giant crabs, penguins etc , the best part was definitely seeing King croc and his girlfriend just relaxing , although it did seem like a small area for them .Overall I would say this is a good few hours well spent , maybe more could be done to enhance the experience of a few areas but kids and adults will enjoy this and it's not too pricey either which is a bonus ."

(3.5 out of 5)The underwater zoo (4.5 out of 5) had everything from amazing fish, large strange rats, otters, crocodiles and desert critters and I thought it was brilliant! Didn't like seeing the salt crocs in small area but fundamentally it gave a close up view of lots of the aquatic animals and lots of interesting information as well.

The underwater zoo was a perfect illustration of substance over scale. Feature after feature of cool underwater critters doing cool underwater critter stuff. Really well laid out. All up close. Amazing for the casual smartphone photographer. Would be very easy to convince your FB friends that you'd been scuba diving somewhere very exotic with some expensive aquatic DSLR rig.

The zoo comprises of penguins and crocodiles apart from a host of fish and aquatic species.

It is differentiated into packages at the start of the tour and the complete tour will take about 5 hours for the last package all activities included, If I'm not wrong it will cost about 230 - 250 AED per person and the basic one starts at 100 AED per person.

The metro drops you at the Mall and you suddenly come across a huge fish tank full of fishes, sharks, rays and eels. We paid the 1000 baht each(20 quid) and thought it expensive at first, but once you get in the tunnel it becomes well worth the money. You are literally a couple of feet away from full sized sharks ....brilliant. There's no one pushing you so you stay as long as you like, but once you've had enough someone guides you upstairs where a guide takes you to the back rooms where you see baby sharks, sea horses and a host of other interesting stuff. You then go into the zoo bit which holds hundreds of animals, spiders, fish,penguins,, and many more.We spent 1 1/2 hours in there so it was well worth the entrance fee."

All good value but you want to pick and choose which highlights are 'must-sees' for you! This will also save you money by not being convinced to 'upgrade' beyond your selections. This options are endless, this activity can be seen from the outside for 10 minutes or you can spend up to the entire day in the aquarium and then underwater zoo with lunch inbetween in the rainforest cafe! You may be able to fit this in with the Burj Khalifa tour, or spread it over two days! Whatever you do.. GO EARLY!!! (Queue before 10am)"

Then there is also behind the scenes walk which was not that fun as the guide did not seem to be to much into it and just wanted to go through his words quickly. Finally you go to an underwater zoo which is fun as well. All in all, time well spent and this is very interesting and unique place."

Dubai likes to boast the biggest of everything, and boasting rights are probably the most distinctive aspect of this aquarium. Your first experience of the aquarium is the huge glass wall to it facing the main corridor of the Dubai Shopping Mall inside of which the aquarium is located. This glass wall is probably one of the biggest fish tanks in the world, and the view from the Mall is for free.About AUD40 gets you inside on a basic ticket. More expensive options involve a boat ride or diving experience but these are pretty basic & not worth the expense in our opinion, as the area involved is not that big and is highly artificial.The tunnel is the highlight. The croc might be a highlight if he is moving, but otherwise it is hard to tell the difference between the animal & its fibreglass image next to his pen.There are lot of exhibits jam-packed into a limited space, but most are interesting & will demand a visit of at least 90mins."

Not only do you get the opportunity to see the aquarium, you'll also have options to feed the fish, dive in the water and go on an underwater boat ride. For the price you pay, it's actually good value.First of all, the queue is long so you will have to wait a while. However, the wait is worth it once you're inside. The Aquarium itself was fascinating although short, as it is one walkway with fishes and sea creatures swimming by over and around you. You can get up close to the glass and take a closer look, which is pretty cool too.The Underwater Zoo was personally more exciting as you got more time and space to take a look around. There are a lot of intriguing creatures, some I've never seen before and plenty of different fishes to look at too. There was a big promotion of the King Croc, with facts plastered around the walls, all leading up to the big reptile. But unfortunately, the Croc was a little underwhelming as he was hyped up to be ruthless and deadly (which I assume he would be if you let him out on the other side of the glass) but he was rather relaxed and lackadaisical, which doesn't offer much entertainment value.All in all, it was a great experience and I felt it was worth buying something from the souvenir store as a remembrance token. I wouldn't go again if I was in Dubai but it's definitely something you should do once."

We were then \"treated\" to a 10 minute trip in a glass bottom boat.

The main Dubai Aquarium tank is visible from the mall without having to pay any entrance fee. However, for only AED120 per person you get full entrance to the underwater tunnel as well as a glass-bottomed boat ride and admission to the marine life exhibits afterwards.The main tank holds predominantly sharks, rays and larger fish types. The publicly viewable areas from the mall are great but the experience is infinitely better if you opt for admission and get the chance to go through the underwater tunnel.The glass-bottomed boat ride takes you on a slow circular ride around what is effectively the top of the main aquarium tank. The guide on the glass-bottomed boat threw some food out and one point and it was great to see the fish jumping out of the water so close to the boat. Other than this, the boat trip didn't have much point to it but as something thrown in as part of the admission it was still a fun experience.The best aspect of the whole place for me is the main area you go to after everything else, where there are many tanks filled with different types of fish. There were piranhas that were fed as we watched, there are giant crabs in tanks, there are jellyfish floating around - in short, a whole lot of variety in one place. Compared to other attractions in Dubai I thought this represented excellent value for money and had a lot more educational value than a lot of other places nearby."

Then you go inside where there are fishes all over (a dome shape where you walk from inside which gives a real good view of species). The collection is very nice unlike other aquariums. Then they take you to a storage place where they show you as well as give you informations about the eggs, growth of species, about their eating habbits etc. You get to see the tinest fishes. You get to feed the fishes too. Other packages also allow you to kind of scuba dive inside with the fishes.Next is on the second floor where you see the underwater zoo having n numbers of water species including fishes, plants, crocodile, penguins, sea snake, turtles etc.Really get to see and learn a lot.

This place is massive and the amount and types of creatures you get to see here are amazing. The place is well kept and clean and is usually populated with tourists, like myself :) I went with a middle-aged friend, but its definitely a place anyone could visit and for all ages. Their are various ticket options, but ours cost about $35. Definitely recommend ppl check this place out :)"

He told us timing of feeding that we didn't quite catch but when asked afterwards were told conflicting information and then weren't allowed out to re-enter the tunnel to see the shark feeding. No signs up about when various things are fed. Simple caf\u00e9 and ice cream available inside which is good as no re-entry allowed."

            "review": "enjoyable experience. Overall I thought the whole thing was good, and surprisingly educational. There are several different ticket types available however, which may affect your experience.I went for the 'researcher' ticket which includes a 'back of house' tour as well as the regular underwater tunnel and zoo. The other reasonably priced ticket was the 'explorer' which included a glass bottomed boat rather than the back of house. The regular underwater tunnel and zoo are included on all ticket types as far as I'm aware.The underwater tunnel was fascinating (don't understand how a bunch of large sharks swimming 1\" away from you could get 1 star in other review...) and was filled with a good selection of *enormous* fish and sea life. There were several divers in the tank at various points, and some of the manta rays were far larger than the divers. As a bonus, rays do always seem to be smiling, which helps lift the mood!After exiting the tunnel, one needed to go up to the second floor for the remainder - the zoo and the 'back of house' tour.The back of house tour showed some of the breeding programmes they ran for sharks, seahorses and so on (who knew that baby sharks were so cute!) and if one took the time to talk to the staff, they were proud of their work and knowledgable.The zoo I found to be pretty extensive ... considering it's in a mall! and had various zones including 'king croc' (the biggest crocodile you'll never want to meet), night animals, reptiles, penguins and of course loads of sea life. Frankly I've not been to many aquariums before, but I personally found the sea life easy to view through what seemed to be clean and decently sized tanks - and most tanks also had descriptive plaques next to them.Perhaps the only part that made me feel uneasy was a 'petting zoo' where it was possible to pet a starfish.Not sure how humane that is - although I'm no expert so I guess it's possible that the starfish didn't mind in the slightest!Anyway, for me overall the aquarium gets a thumbs up."

I enjoyed that this one is free to view (in part), and if you want to pay some $ you can get a behind the scenes tour. Got to see the food prep and shark artificial insemination area and the sick holding tanks and the little jellyfish and brine shrimp they grow and then you walk through an area that has some cool critters. I lucked out and caught the otter feeding (it was at like 11am I think). The otters are trained so they run up the ladder and wave to you and then leap down the slide. The giant crabs were freaky and the pineapple fish were the weirdest I have seen. The croc is huge and taking photos won't do it justice when you show your friends. The free tunnel is 100% worth going through. They have an option to scuba but the price was like $280 for a 30 minute dive with a 60 minute briefing (and that is with a PADI card-without is like $100 more for a lesson) so I passed. Tons of sharks and rays and a guitarfish. The place is worth a visit"

I booked an explorer ticket but I did this online before I visited so it saved me approx 30 dirhams. I went in the morning and mid week so wasn't busy at all allowing you to have a leisurely stroll through the aquarium and underwater zoo. The explorer ticket gives you a behind the doors access tour with a guide showing you the labs and the science behind the aquarium.

The space in the aquarium is tight, and the marine life is available in abundance, so everywhere you look, you are bound to see something beautiful. My dive buddy and dive master (both from Al Boom) were both extremely professional and made sure I had an excellent experience. We went to see the King Croc after, and we were amazed to see its size. I had seen these crocs at a distance on a recent trip to Africa, but I haven't managed to see them up close until I visited the Dubai aquarium. They also have a caribou caf\u00e9 in the aquarium to satisfy those caffeine / sugar cravings.Its one of the touristy things to do while in Dubai, but well worth it!"

Once inside the tunnel, lots of photo opportunities. You are surrounded by sharks and stingrays. At the end of the tunnel you can go upstairs and see the Zoo which I would rate very high just for the fact that we are talking about a zoo in a shopping Mall. At the top level one can enjoy boat ride in the aquarium. We found the boat ride really good. A bit expensive, but worth the money."

The purchase of tickets will let you entry to the tunnel, which ends too soon!! But the highest disappointment is yet to come. You'll realize later that all the pics you took inside the tunnel, has reflections of all those people standing outside and clicking snaps!! The underwater zoo has some nice collection of animals, but again the collection is not too awe inspiring. Full marks to the management effort for managing and maintaining this facility so well, in the middle of such a harsh land mass. Key advice, avoid purchasing tickets from the counter, plan your trip in advice and look for online deals."

It cost 100 Dirhams per adult for entrance but it was worth it. We were in the attraction for about 90 minutes in total so do allow enough time for your visit if you want to see all the areas that your entrance ticket is valid for. We walked through the tunnel then had to go upstairs to see other aspects of the zoo. The penguins were really nice but we were particularly enthralled to see an Ethiopian hedgehog that we have never seen before. We saw areas behind the scenes on escorted visits with staff explaining how they maintain the water conditions for the aquarium. We also saw their fish breeding centre, where they had tiny baby seahorses in a small tank. There were some huge crocodiles on display and lots of baby crocodiles that they were rearing in the breeding centre.

Don't worry, sharks are so cute because they are not wild as they raised on the fish tank. You can have a sit on a cadge and they put you in the water to have a deeper look.

However to get close and to walk through the tunnel through the middle you need to purchase one of their packages.They have different packages starting from 100 Durhams which provide for different experiences including diving with the sharks.I took the basic package which was the aquarium, a ten minute tour of behind the scenes - how they grow the food, etc (quite interesting) - and the underwater zoo.An option for 10 Durhams is to feed the fish. This involves throwing some pellets into the water for the Trevally to eat. As no-one in my group had paid for this the guide did it. Unless you have young kids recommend you save the 10 Durhams.The underwater zoo is great - lots of small aquariums and other displays of aquatic creatures.

I've done quite a bit of the tourist thing in Dubai since I've been here, and it begins to seem as if everything is overpriced, so when I got to the entrance of the Dubai Aquarium, I thought here we go again. BUT the underwater tunnel simply blows your mind away, the aquarium gives you a generous dollop for your money, and then the underwater zoo, which is part of the attraction is amazing. It seems to go on and on, and just when you think you've seen it all, there's another whole section of fun things to experience. Truly the hidden gem of the Dubai tourist circuit, in fact I'd pay the cash to do it again. Get there early, wear comfortable shoes, and try the virtual googles. It's twenty bucks extra, you look like a fool, but it's something different and that's what we're all looking for. (Negative: They could look after their otter a little better. It looked like it was taking strain.)"

We through we would do this before our visit to the Burj but when we initially saw the queues were going to leave, however paying by credit card to one of the staff outside meant we went in very swiftly. Didn't take the full experience but walked under the aquarium (around 14 sharks included) took the back lot tour (very short but interesting and a very enthusiastic staff member feeding the fish into a frenzy made it entertaining too!) and then the 'zoo' which is a bit of a mixed bag. The zoo includes a large crocodile - king croc, usual range of tropical fish, large and small as well as penguins. Found it quite entertaining. Cost was roughly 20 Uk pounds each and we spent nearly two hours there. Some queuing inside for the back lot."

You can see the huge tank filled with all sorts of fish, rays and sharks as you're walking past and you can't help but stop and look.We booked in to go cage diving in the tank and were provided with a wet suit, snorkeling gear and instructions from the dive team. We were shown to a reasonable sized cage which was submerged right in the centre of the tank and was part metal bars, part perspex glass. It was a great experience having the sharks swim right past, just inches away.Once we'd finished in there we walked around the rest of the aquarium which was quite big and contained some great sights including the biggest crocodile I've ever seen!As you exit the main aquarium you get to walk through a perspex tunnel which goes straight through the main tank and gives you a great view of the fish and sharks. Well worth a visit if you have the time - probably around an hour to see the lot although you could spend a lot longer."

A walk through the main aquarium offers the chance to get up close to so many creatures that most of us would never see out in the wild. Sharks of many types and sizes, rays .... my daughter (studying marine biology at uni) and i went up and down several times. We the progressed upstairs to the 'zoo' and after seeing a few fishy exhibits that were interesting we came upon the giant croc who it seems is destined to live in a concrete enclosure with no natural light for many years to come. Whilst he has his female mate with him I felt it to be devoid of any stimulation. A similar story for the penguins. Admittedly conventional zoos are not my thing and so I left feeling just a bit disheartened to feel that these creatures were all now living in the artificial confines of a shopping mall. Many others have been and loved it though so my opinion is just that."

Being so close to a shark makes you really feel nervous a bit... :) also the HUGE Crocodile has made an impression on us (zoo). Photos as always far too expensive (nearly 300!!! AED). We also used the opportunity to use Oculus Rift for 20 AED to get a 360 view under water. It was really good and my first experience with that technology. Also this a MUST SEE :)"

            "review": "Good Attraction in the Mall. It's very hard to miss the impressive display of the aquarium when you visit the mall. The tickets are around 100AED. The tunnel is fairly short and doesn't capture how massive the tank really is. Once you're done with the tunnel (which didn't take us more than 10 minutes), you are invited up to the third floor and then do a mini \"behind the scenes\" tour. It was fairly topical about what they do at the aquarium and they do show the lifecycle of a few different animals they have there. The feeding of the fish was neat. I did find the tour guide too soft-spoken for size of the group and the ambient noise from the machines--she was too hard to hear.The zoo was nice to wander around in. Had a hilarious experience with one of their archer fish literally shooting my eye when I was watching them. King Croc exhibit was out of this world. All in all, the aquarium was a nice experience but I thought it was a bit too pricey. But, hey, it's Dubai. I think next time I'm in town I'll try to arrange a dive in the aquarium."

            "review": "More school trip than family day out.... The aquarium is pretty pricey to visit and to be honest, the most impressive part is really the huge aquarium you can see for free simply by going to the mall. For the ticket, you get to wander through the tunnel which goes under the aquarium. However, it is really short and save for a few upclose Sharks you don't see anything more than you do outside. You don't get a feeling that you are really \"under the sea\" because you can see the mall and all the people outside still!The ticket also gains you access to the sea zoo upstairs.This contains loads of tanks of various interesting sea creature. From piranhas to otters, even a penguin tank (small and probably not that nice for the Penguins). The various fish tanks are pretty cool to look at.In the upper section you get to see some desert creatures in glass displays. There is also a humoungous crocodile in a tank who is pretty impressive.All the tanks are fairly small and empty of anything except the various animals so you can make your way around probably in an hour or so. It is interesting but not great value for money and the whole thing feels a little rundown and more for school trips than a family day out in my opinion. Maybe if you get your ticket as part of a deal that offers entry to other Dubai attractions, but on its own I thought it was overpriced a a bit disappointing."

The Dubai Aquarium provided us with an experience where we can honestly say that we were truly astonished and educated at the same time. The main tanks provide a superb viewpoint for observing the major exhibits - including rays and medium sized sharks, which of course are open to public view on two floors of the Mall itself. We found the Underwater Zoo area fascinating - and the tuition session gave valuable insight into the management issues of maintaining such a huge complex as well as feeding the fish. If you wondered why the predators do not decimate their tank-mates, this visit will enlighten you. The prize exhibit is, of course, the enormous 5-metre long salt water crocodile. It is impossible to imagine what one of these creatures looks like unless you see it in the flesh - it is truly impressive. We visited on the basic \"Researcher\" package and found the experience very worthwhile."

As you can see the aquarium from the mall itself I thought what more could it offer?For the price of around 100 AED I found it very good value for money.The tunnel was actually really good and we spent quite a while just looking at all the different fishes. And from within the tunnel you can get so close to the different fishes and particularly the sharks which you cant really see from outside in the mall. After that you move on upstairs where there was a small simulator ride (more for the kids) followed by the boat ride whicjh is glass bottomed so you can see the fish from above and from a different angle whilst the guide gives various information on the fishes and what they are, what they eat etc which was very informative.After the boat ride you can then go through to where all the other fishes and animals are housed in their tanks which I didnt know was available from penguins to otters to a massive king crocodile. The only downside was perhaps there could be some information plaques by each tank explaing what each fish/animal is and some cool facts about them (where are they from, how old, what they eat etc). And also I think to try and take photos of people and then charge them silly amount of money for is a little over the top so would suggest to stop this or charge only a small nominal fee.Overall, regardless of whether you are a resident here or a tourist I found this to be well worth the entrance fee!"

The Underwater Zoo with the marine animals is on the second floor. Was great fun watching the many sharks swimming over your head.

The aquarium is set out nicely and is very pretty. One of the benefits of the explorer package was that you can go behind the scenes of the aquarium and see what it is like at the top of the tank. We also got to see different sea creatures growing in different stages for example jelly fish and sea horse. There are other options available where you take a short trip on a glass bottomed boat across the top of the tank to see the fish. You get a good view without doing that though but it is something to consider. Overall, an enjoyable hour or so."

So many people just gather around the place taking photos and videos or just watch the flow of time, in that case fish time . The tickets was worth it 100 AED each, you will get unlimited time under the aquarium, we spent 20 min, then went up 2nd floor, to check out a 10 min educational tour about the fish and a close look above the Aquarium which was so amazing. You might need to be patient especially in rush hour. Finally, the zoo which was also unlimited access time, we spent there almost 45 min, Checking out the amazing animals and fish etc. My son and many kids there loved the place, from crocodile, penguins to sharks, which were many compared to Atlantis lost chambers Aquarium. There is a bathroom and a caribou coffee plus an ice cream shop in the Zoo, to refeshen up and take a break a bit. The place is a bit humid, so wear casual, shorts and light. Tip:Make sure to take antiseptic clean wipes or gel, since kids are playing all over the place and keep scrubing there eyes, mouths and nose. Highly recommended for every one. "

The Aquarium can be viewed when you are in the Dubai Mall (its 11m high and 30+m long) and you will be mesmorised by the selection of marine life inside the tank. For an enhanced experience, go behind the scenes of the Aquarium and see the Zoo. If you dare, you can also scuba dive in the tank. Good value for great experience."

As soon as you enter the Mall from the front entrance you cannot miss the immense crowd who is looking at the massive Aquarium window. If you buy a ticket you'll have a privilege to see it also from the inside of the 20m glass tunnel. After you finish viewing the Aquarium you are invited 2 floor up to walk trough the Underwater Zoo, and believe me, there's lots to see as well. I have never imagine to be standing so close to a 6 meters long crocodile..."

Averall the tunnel is nice, you can see the sharks really close, you can't see them from outside. Behind the scenes tour could be a bit better, they show you how they reproduce all the organisms (fish and plants). In my opinion the best thing was underwater zoo. You can see different fish species, the biggest crocodile in the world. Everything looks so natural, there is so many plants and the aquariums are open at the top so you feel more close to the animals."

            "review": "Worth Visiting the Fish. We visited the Dubai Aquarium on a Friday morning (July 31st). We debated as to whether to go inside because some of the Tripadvisor reviews indicated you already get a nice view of the fish from inside the mall. Since it was not crowded, we decided to buy tickets. There were three levels of tickets and we chose the least expensive at 100 dirham each ($27). It allowed you to walk through the tunnel which was similar to other aquariums we have visited. Then you go back out into the mall and up to levels using an escalator to see the rest of the exhibits. At first you have a guide who walks you through the behind the scenes and gives you brief explanations regarding the work of the aquarium. You get to see how big the tank is from the inside and preparation of food for the animals. After that you get to walk through the exhibits which I thought were very good. They had a variety of sea animals including penguins, octopus, spider crabs, jellyfish and piranha. There was also a nocturnal desert section which included scorpions and bats and a separate bird section. The final exhibit was for the king crocs one of which was extremely large. There was a video playing showing how they captured and brought the croc to Dubai. As you walk out, you pass through the gift shop which had interesting items for sale at reasonable prices. It was nice to enter at 10am on Friday when the mall and the aquarium were not crowded. We had the ability to spend as much time as we wanted looking at the exhibits without anyone around us. However, I can see how the place could get very crowded and uncomfortable as some of the spaces in front of the exhibits were small and would fill quickly. There were clean toilets near the nocturnal desert section and places to buy coffee and gelato as you viewed the exhibits. This attraction was definitely worth the price we paid and there is much more to see than just the large aquarium from inside the mall. Our 9 year old son was very excited to see each of the exhibits."

The zoo itself has been welcoming visitors since the mall first opened and this is not the first time I had visited this attraction. However, the draw of the aquarium's latest attraction, King Croc, was enough to encourage a return visit. The price of entry into the zoo and a walk through the aquarium's tunnel is approximately 70 dhs; however, there are a variety of packages available including a behind the scenes tour, a boat ride on the large aquarium tank itself and diving experiences with the resident sharks. On this occasion, I simply chose to opt for entry into the aquarium and tunnel.The zoo itself is of a fairly decent size and there are certainly an array of creatures to delight and intrigue all ages. The addition of the night-time creatures, including hedgehogs and bats, were worth seeing, but there is no doubt that the star attraction -King Croc- steals the show. King Croc is truly a natural marvel and visitors can find out more about how King Croc came to be at the zoo through the brief information video, which is worth stopping to see.If you have not yet visited the underwater zoo, or haven't been there in a while, it is worth a trip if you are in the vicinity. The fact that Dubai Mall, the fountains and the Burj Khalifa are all nearby means that you can incorporate a visit to the underwater zoo as part of a day out in the city."

Therefore when I got a chance to go there finally with my family we were not miss the opportunity to enter the Dubai Mall's aquarium. The ticket price was quite pricey though for us. The lowest price package was Researcher pack for 100 AED in that pack we got aquarium tunnel, underwater zoo, back of house tour and underwater observatory. As we started our tour we found out that yes it was huge but we've seen bigger aquarium than this one though. However the most interested part was actually not the aquarium to me but the back of the house tour and underwater obaervatory where we were grouped for about 10-15 people with 1 official tour guide from Dubai Mall Aquarium and during the tour she explained what this company has already done to preserve the nature of the ocean. It was a comprehensive explanation included how they managed the aquarium. We also got a chance to see how they fed the fishes and led us to one level down to see it ourself. Some people bought additional pack to fed the fish so we saw how those group of fishes were coming and grabbed the food. It was quite fun though and the best part after roaming inside the aquarium when you finished you could continue your journey for shopping for sure.. Coz why not you're already inside Dubai Mall anyway :D"

In my opinion, the staff of attractions like these are the make it or break it point of reference, and at Dubai Aquarium they passed with flying colors. The staff willingly open up dialogue about the animals and the aquarium. It did not seem like they were doing a job, but more a hobby. Also importantly, the aquarium itself was awe inspiring. The huge main aquarium really is something to behold, but behind the scenes is also a nice treat as you get to see the animals on the inside and more up close. The main attraction when we went was the King Croc, and while the animal is impressive, there was not much to see as he was simply lying there doing nothing (a feeding/activity would have made it so much better). I do recommend this, especially for families."

The exhibits are well maintained and the archer fish put on a splendid display of shooting jets of water at targets above them which they took to be flies as they hunt in their natural environment. My grandson was amazed, especially by the nurse sharks which he seemed to be well informed about. The crocodile exhibit is quite awe inspiring to see such large creatures up close and safely.The only down side is the constant pressure to have one's photo taken by staff at almost every turn."

The aquarium is smaller than many aquariums in the United States (New Orleans, Omaha Zoo, Florida Aquarium in Tampa); however, this still has many great exhibits. You can see the largest tank from outside of the exhibit for free - and that alone is super impressive.It is very expensive for the amount of time that you will spend here, and it falls short on the educational opportunities like other (larger) aquariums. There are still many experiences that looked cool like scuba diving inside the large tank - it's just super expensive.If you are visiting here from the US or have been to a large aquarium before, save your money. There are so many other things to do in Dubai that you simply cannot see anywhere else. My suggestion is to grab an ice cream cone, head up to the second or third level and enjoy the people watching / viewing of the large (free) exhibit."

We bought a aquarium package with the underwater zoo and were taken on some behind the scenes tour. fine but we couldn't hear or understand the guide, she was rude and if you spoke to your family or members in the group she would tell you off!! The second half of the tour was down a set of stairs to feed fish ( we didn't pay for it) and we were just left on the top separated as we had children in prams. She didn't ask us or assist us, we were just left there. So we walked out. very disappointing. She should not be working in face to face customer service.

The entrance is started with shark tunnel where you could see different spices of fish there . Passing the tunnel you could see different spices of animals, such as crocodile, penguin, etc. Then we tried glass boat , where you could see fishes down and next to you . Even the person in charge gave some food to the fishes. A 3D cinema is there to show the story of small turtle animation. Even you could touch star fishes.

You are able to see the underwater world and live its life feeling as part of it for as long as you want. It is a very sophisticated place and a great unforgettable experience us.You can enjoy it without paying a fee. You can buy the ticket and get first c lass experience there. The Dubai Mall is the biggest in the world as expected."

Divers were in the water hand feeding sting rays, fascinating to watch. When we completed the walk we entered the tunnel and straight above us were sharks, so still you'd be hard pushed not to believe they were plastic, then, a swish of the tail and it peel away further into the depths. I must admit as I suffer from Meniers I got extremely giddy at this point but the said tunnel is not that long, loads of fish to see up close, wonderful. Then we were off to see the tanks, specialist fish in each one. Giant crabs, otters, water rats, fish that spit to get prey ( I our case bait) we took bets on which fish would get the food and for small fish it was amazing how large the bait that they \"caught\". We saw a wonderful crocodile and thought it rather special until we saw its roommate - it was humongous !There were tree frogs, lizards, gerbils, owls and many more.They have also added a conservation talk and area, alas the boys are far too young to understand, they just couldn't wait to see the next item.Well worth the money. Well worth seeing the excitement on their faces. Would go again without a doubt. Throughly enjoyed it. There is also a boat ride with a glass bottom, but again, boys didn't want to know."

Also, the entry fee (like everything in the Dubai Mall) was expensive.

Once you exit the tunnel you have to leave the aquarium and take the escalator up to the next level where you can see a variety of fish, crocs, penguins, spiders, lizards, and crabs. After that you can stop in one of the gift shops to buy souvenirs. There are also opportunities to have professional photos taken (for purchase).

I was miffed and when I explained that I had checked earlier about accessibility the staff member became argumentative and said that the whole exhibit is wheelchair accessible as long as he can walk down stairs! I tried to explain that stipulation negated the term fully accessible. To avoid further conflict we paid for the walk thru the aquarium and the tunnel. Not what we had prepared our son for and that was disappointing. and frustrating."

            "review": "The world underwater................ To dive the Dubai Mall aquarium was an interesting experience to even seasoned divers. It will most certainly be an unforgettable experience to new or non-divers. The fact that you will be in a tank (albeit a giant one) full of many different species of sharks, can be a bit unnerving, if not crazy, for new divers. The common knowledge however, that sharks are typically shy creatures and tend to avoid human contact, should be of some comfort for the inexperienced. Nonetheless, the Shark Dive program at Dubai Mall is an exhilarating underwater adventure that you can experience in half-a-day, with complete safety and airconditioned comfort. The aquarium's visitor dive programs are managed by 'Al Boom Dive Center', which is well established and one of the oldest dive shops in Dubai. The aquarium offers dive experiences to both certified and non-divers. Al Boom Dive Center can be contacted by phone on +9714 342 2993 or email dives@thedubaiaquarium.com Certified divers must present their c-cards and make payment in advance to turn up for briefing at the Underwater Zoo (located directly above the Aquarium), whilst non-divers must visit the Al Boom Dive training center, located on Jumeriah Road (33rd St., Villa 254, corner Al Wasl Road, next door to the Iranian consulate and 500 meters away from the Iranian hospital) for the \"Discover Scuba Diving Course\" in the morning. This is an easy and very safe training session on Scuba basics in a swimming pool with full Scuba gear, followed by the Aquarium Dive (at the Mall) later in the day. Even children 10 years and older can participate. As I hadn't planned for this visit to Dubai to include diving, I didn't have my gear nor my c-card. Therefore I had to undergo the discover scuba program and train a bit in the pool at the dive shop training center in Jumeirah and drove to the mall (about 30 minutes away) afterwards for the briefing and dive. The Shark Dive briefing included key topics such as keeping your arms to yourself and not reaching out to the sharks etc; which took about 20 mintes. The use of personal underwater cameras are not allowed, but the souvenir pictures staff photographers stand outside of the aquarium to take your pictures, which you may choose to purchase when leaving. The dive itself was a fantastic experience with close encounters of some of the deadliest underwater predators, but the sharks always maintained distance and appeared accustomed to having divers in their space. The rays and groupers in the tank together with the numerous other fishes make for a dive experience that will be hard to forget. This is a must-do activity if you are in Dubai and like to indulge in exhilarating activities and especially if you are into water sports or diving. The cost may make a significant dent in your holiday budget, especially if you are a couple, but more than make-up with such a unique experience. I was told that it's also a favorite marriage proposal option for couples :)."

I'm PADI AOWD and even EAX certified, last dive in May this year in Egypt, so just 6 weeks back. I use since 15 hours of dive a GoPro Hero HD, also for pool lessons, that I wanted to bring with me into the Aquarium. That was only possible, if I have the PADI photography speciality course, what nonsense. I tried my best to persuade, even had 10 hours of footage on my laptop to proof that I'm not a goofy, but had no chance to get in as wanted, unless they make a video of me. Naturally I prefer myself to film what I find nice. So I had to leave the place. This is by far the biggest single disappointing (PADI) dive moment in my life."

I never go to Dubai Mall without stopping at the aquarium to see the rays, sharks and various species of fishes. It is free to view the aquarium from outside but if you want to go through the tunnel under the aquarium, you need to pay an entry fee which also includes entry to the zoo. I had always thought this would be a waste of money but was pleasantly surprised when we finally paid to see everything. While going through the tunnel, the views of the rays especially is great and we discovere a few more hidden away species and an eel. The zoo is quite big and houses all kinds of water creatures including king crabs (amazing), cute penguins and of course the croc family now including baby croc. We spent a good two hours at the zoo.There are also other activities available at an addition charge like scuba diving in the aquarium or a boat ride."

We visited it because we the screaming hot sun would't allow for outdoor activity so we had time to kill indoor. It is not cheap and the value of tickets is based on what kind of experiences you are looking for. You can go for a short boat experience or go in the submarine simulator and so on. For people with children it is a nice one because it is well designed and kinder friendly :) Otherwise, you can go and visit for the sake of King Croc that has 2,4 m in lenght.

As with most popular tourist attractions there are photographer trying to get you to buy serially overpriced, tacky framed photos. Not necessary and they look so fake because they are! Taken in front of a green scree and superimposed onto a new back ground. Enough about that. Enjoy the tunnel and the insane amount of sharks and fish right up close. The rest of the aquarium is well kept and shows a big variety of species. Being an Aussie I didn't like the Crocodile enclosure, I prefer large animal in their natural habitat and they looked sad. The floor is just roughened concrete, plastic flowers and vines, not a single natural thing about it. Awful. I was surprised to watch the video about how these prehistoric creatures travelled to Dubai and again I felt for them. Anyway, if you can put your heart on hold for 5 minutes I guess it is the only way many people will ever see one...I am not a zoo person. Fish in tanks, thats ok, Crocs on concrete, not ok. Lots of people enjoying seeing them obviously. Overall, a great experience and worth a visit, especially in Summer as it is lovely and cool inside. An hour for a quick whip around or a few hours to study each tank. We did it in just under 2 hours. There is a cafe (closed during Ramadan) and bathrooms inside."

While I found the glass bottom boat to be very boring, he loved it and would have stayed on it for hours. I thought the tour was a bit basic, but he was very into it and had good questions. He was fascinated by shark eggs on display, etc. The glass tunnel is great for viewing, though it made my husband motion sick. Our 16 year old liked the tunnel best. We spent 2 hours at the aquarium. Way more than enough time for 3 of us, but the 12 year old could have lasted the day. Take note: if you want to do the scuba experience, do not book Burj Khalifa the same day. You can't go up for 18 hours after. Big mistake on our part as the 12 year old is scuba certified and very much wanted to do this."

We purchased the standard ticket (called Explorer I think), which worked out to be \u00a320 each and I was surprised by what great value this ended up being - especially for Dubai. The tunnel in the aquarium is fascinating - the rays and sharks are not shy and swim next to (if you're afraid of sharks then perhaps this isn't for you) and once you are through and you make your way to the 2nd floor they take you behind the scenes for a guided tour and tell you about their breeding programmes and how they care for the animals. After this your ticket then gives you access to the underwater zoo complete with penguins, reptiles and suspended walkways. We spent much longer there than I thought we would and it was so immersive that I forgot that we were still in the middle of a mall!"

The simulator I think was more for kids than adults so I prob wouldn't to that package again, also the glass bottom boat although it was good it just went round a short circuit which wasn't quite what I expected either so I prob would choose a different experience next time. The aquarium is set over a few different floors and has hundreds of thousands of fish and reptiles, insects etcYou could spend hours here and as far as I'm aware your not asked to leave so you literally could spend hours here. There is so much to see and the place is so well laid out and extremely well kept. I have been to aquariums before that seemed a bit passed their best and had a very fishy off smell but not here the standards were very high!!The only downside I would say if I had to was the price of the photos and photo gifts were a small fortune! It was approximately \u00a328 for a photo, and \u00a348 for your photo in a flask! Which is a shame, I would have bought some of the photos (as they are actually printed out for you to see) but there was no way I was going to pay that for a photo. "

I really loved that it was very kid friendly with all the tanks low down to the ground for my daughter to see into! They even had an area that was specifcally about the local animals to the UAE. HINT: If you don't care about a behind the scenes tour/fish feeding and just want the aquarium experience(cool for older kids but not much for younger ones) you can get cheaper tickets online. They dont offer the basic ticket at the counter"

If time permits (restricted timings), definitely try the Shark Feeding. Ticketing is fast and convenient, no reservations needed.

So instead of paying AED 120, we only paid AED 50. I was grateful and impressed by the treatment. Well, that did not last long. Some guy calling himself the manager insisted that Yousif would not be allowed to go on the boat ride because we did not pay for him in full. I tried to explain and he would not listen until one of his colleagues explained to him. There was no way we would leave Yousif alone which meant I or my wife to have to forego the boat ride which we had paid for. Then he asked for a UAE-issued special needs card. That is when his colleague interfered. Even then, the so called manager told us that we should be thankful as he had decided to let us go. The irony of the matter is that the boat ride was no more than a waist of time along with the preceding simulator or Explorer ride. We saw nothing more than the boat attendant throwing some food and some fishes racing to get it. The place was dark, humid and smelly to say the least.The better part was walking through the \"Underwater Zoo\" where we saw beautiful variety of fishes, underwater creatures and other animals (birds, snakes and lizards). The mismanagement manifests itself here too. We did not know where we were going; left or right, up or down! It is really confusing.Finally to go through the very short aquarium tunnel, we had to go out, take the escalator two levels down and find our way through the crowds to the entry area."

Basic entry for kids is about 55 AED pp \u00a310/\u20ac14/$15, (70 for adults), but doesn't cover the 'zoo' part such as feeding the crocodiles or bird feeding. The whole package is 200, although I'd suggest the explorers package at 120 AED is the best value.

Under the entertainer voucher book the buy one get one free entry applies to the ticket to aquarium and zoo only. None of other extras are included. I'm sure some of the extras are worth looking into if you are so inclined. I would not personally recommend the glass bottom boat tour, majority of fish are at bottom of aquarium so you don't really see very much. The 'glass' is also quite badly scratched from all previous occupants. The aquarium itself is an engineering masterpiece. Unbelievably huge with a tunnel so you can pass through the bottom central part of the tank. My one and only complaint about the aquarium is that it can be very hard to take great photos. The aquarium is very well illuminated, the mall corridor area around the tank is not, then the shop signage etc is well illuminated, this causes massive reflections on the outside of the aquarium which are difficult to avoid. Same applies in the tunnel, but instead of it being a reflection it's the actual store/signage you can see. After completing the aquarium you proceed up to the 2nd level of the mall where underwater zoo is located. This is great fun and has everything from fish, otters, beavers, creepy crawlies and as of recently a huge crocodile and even more recently some baby crocs! The new crocodile enclosure is great, depending where they are you can get a superb view of them from lower and upper levels. Aquarium and Underwater Zoo are both fully accessible by pram and wheelchair (excluding the adventure rope bridges) so is open to visits by all."

I am a huge animal person as its my profession. I looked at trip advisor and the reviews were up and down, most said dont spend the money and just look at the giant tank from the mall side and I definitely have to agree!!! I went online and purchased the \"gold\" package which included what was claimed as a behind the scenes tour and fish feeding for 80AED. If you're in Dubai with very small children and need something to appease them ehhhh I still might rethink going. For the ridicculous price Its quite craptacular. The initial tunnel through the main tank doesnt even really allow you to see the large tank, not to mention the glare is horrendous. There are very few signs describing the fish or their environments. You can blow through this money trap in 30min which was too long for me and again zoo animals are my profession. The tanks for the fish suffice for the most part but when you get to the larger animals everything looks like they got lazy and built an enclosure to throw animals in. Nothing about the entire building was educational so dont think your child will take much away besides saying they saw some fish and animals. The king croc is supposed to be a highlight and while he is huge seeing him up close the video of this salt water crocodile being caught in Australia with its dramatic , music and narration had me disturbed at the fact they took him from the wild to be displayed on the third floor of a building in a thrown together enclosure. The part that had me FURIOUS I paid for the \"gold package\" and it turns into a hassle. I ask the employees at different checkpoints they have, where do we go for the behind the scenes and feeding and im told oh thats not on your ticket YET it clearly shows the price on my receipt was for that cost. I move forward to another checkpoint where everyone is handed food for feeding except me and when I say we didnt recieve a cup im told I dont have that package. YET AGAIN I pull out my receipt and she tells me it doesnt say gold package on there yet the cost is the exact price of two people for that package so I then had to pull up my email. All this for the crappiest tour ever. I completely wasted my money for literally 8 minutes of being taken to the back to see the filtration system and quarantine tank. What about the fish feeding u ask, we dumped out the food cups into the large tank and that was it, so let me take that back the tour was 6 minutes. It was such a rip off we thought they were joking when they said it was over. Please dont waste your money watch the large tank from the outside and move on with your trip."

I guess it is a good escape from the heat if you have children with you but I rate it as average, I have seen better. To get the most out of it you probably need to take advantage of booking a dive with the sharks. Someone told me Atlantis would have been a better choice."

Fish are spectacular however the more I looked the more I became slightly distressed about the size of the aquarium they were in and how many there were in the tanks.The animals in the zoo looked also to be too small for either the size of the animal or the amount in there.The children seemed to love it lAlot of school trips there when we went.The simulator submersable was a bit of a let down and the glass bottom boat was also over too quick.This is great for educating children on fish and related water Animals however I still think it appeared cramped."

            "review": "Disappointing. My husband and I stopped into the Aquarium and Underwater Zoo on a recent trip to the Dubai Mall. We used our combo entertainer voucher and also purchased a ticket for a ride on the glass bottom boat. The Aquarium was so busy it was uncomfortable to walk through and there were lots of rude and aggressive people pushing and shoving their way through the tunnel. This continued up to the underwater zoo especially at King Croc... people were just pushing in front of us, standing on our feet etc. We were told to be at the boat for 12.10 for the glass bottom boat ride. We arrived at this time only to wait for 10 minutes without any information from any of the staff as to what was happening. The staff seemed to be in bad moods and some were openly shouting at each other. There were lots of bored customers waiting around who were complaining that they had been there for ages. It would have been nice to be told that they show was running 20 minutes late before-hand so that we could have done something else with our time. The boat trip itself was not what we expected. As we waited to be taken on the boat, we were handed threadbare life jackets that smelled a bit funny to wear while we sat and waited for another 10 minutes in a different section. The continual bleeping of the underwater music was starting to wear a bit thin by this point. Also the AC was either not working or not good as it was very warm. We were led down to the boat and met our tour guide. She was friendly and gave us some information on the aquarium. I was surprised to see that we were pulled along by a bit of string, it looked very cheap. There were many boats on the water at the same time. The boat was full and there were children running over the glass so we didn't actually get to see very much anyway. We won't be back."

            "review": "Thoroughly enjoyable. Having just a 1-day stop-over in Dubai, we were determined to get to see the Aussie crocodile which they have in the Aquarium/Zoo.Just getting out of the blistering heat into the Dubai Mall was a pleasure in itself and we spent a bit of time window shopping before making our way to the ticket office.Fortunately, there was no queue and we soon had our tickets. (if you do not want to pay for the complete experience, it is possible to watch many of the fish from the Mall itself).Ticket options are a bit confusing but we went for the Researcher option which cost 100 AED.This ticket took us into the aquarium proper on the ground floor where we enjoyed the vast array of fish to be seen, including the very large rays and sharks. These swim next to you on either side as well as over your head as you walk through the tunnel.We were there at feeding time and got a really good view of the whole process.When leaving this section you return to the Mall going to a higher level where you enter into the 'behind the scenes' area.Here, there is a guide who explains all the work going into the research and protection of the various species. Without going into a lot of detail, I found it very interesting as, I am sure, will most visitors.Up another level takes to you to the 'Zoo' with its variety of mammal, bird and aquatic life, with some magnificent specimens on display.It was here that we found King Croc and his much smaller 'wife'. It is worth the entrance fee just to see this magnificent creature and to know that he was spared from being turned into handbags by the Australians.All in all, we must have spent close to 4 hours in this attraction without getting the slightest bit bored.If you are in Dubai and have not visited the aqurium yet, go , spend the money and have a thoroughly enjoyable couple of hours.I would have rated the attraction 5 out of 5 but I do not believe that the enclosure for the crocodiles, and to a lesser extent, the fish, are large enough for them. Having said that, they have a very successful breeding programme (we even saw shark eggs in various stages of development) which seems to imply that the captive creatures are happy in their current environment as, otherwise, they would not breed."

It does concern me that the fabulous creatures in the aquarium aren't swimming around in the oceans in freedom, but what you are told when you visit, is that many of the marine mammals in the Aquarium and Underwater Zoo would otherwise risk being poached, and many risk extinction. The Sheik of Dubai is known for his love and respect for animals and one of his intentions was to ensure the attractions at Dubai did not jeopardise any animal or mammals like at the US parks. He (and the Jumeriah Group) have invested in years of research with experts in marine welfare to ensure what is being offered here actually offers a sanctuary to some of these creatures. What you see therefore in the Aquarium are some of the World's most remarkable and endangered species.Now, when the adverts say come to our Aquarium and Underwater Zoo, and experience the wonders they are not over-estimating..... this set up is incredible. The Zoo and Aquarium is huge and awesome thus comes the expression again \"Only In Dubai\"! NO expense has been spared here, and the sheer size of this structure is frightening! Not cheap but again, what is in Dubai. What I would say is read all about it online before you visit, because there is so much to see, and experience, and there are special experiences you won't necessarily know about until you get there and you may need to make allowances for in clothing etc, that you'd do best to look first and not be disappointed. So, it does get very busy in season (May through August and December through January) so you will need to pre-book and get there early."

If you want to go on the boat ride, add another AED 20 etc. Dubai Aquarium has a wide selection of tropical fishes & fresh water fishes. Our 2 year old totally enjoyed himself seeing all the fishes. It may be a little pricey if there are many of you but Dubai Aquarium is 1 of a kind & not to be missed! Two thumbs up."

But I do have to say once in a while it is something enjoyable.You pay the ticket and you get to see the huge tank that you can see just by walking inside the mall, but most importantly there are other interesting animals living behind the whole venue, it is a whole other world.Only visit when you are sick of the malls all the time."

We could walk into a tunnel under the aquarium where we had sharks swimming overhead which was incredible! Then we continued the adventure upstairs at the zoo. the rest of the tour takes place 2 floors up from the aquarium. The zoo was decorated like a jungle with trees, vines and rope bridges too! We saw more aqualife, lizards, otters, owls, snakes and spiders. The big surprise was the giant crocodile aptly named 'King Croc '. There are plenty of viewing areas around him so you can take lots of photographs. It's a really fun experience and it's right in the middle of one of the biggest shopping malls in the world. I would highly recommend it. There are different packages that offer more to do but we chose the basic package which cost 80dhs per person which is great value for money."

The ability to collect these large fish and reptiles and house them in the mega mall is truly impressive and an experience not to be missed. The only negative is that the place is very busy with trail of people and you feel the need to hurry on rather than take your time. If you do take the time and observe for longer than fleeting seconds the power and the grace of the oceans becomes apparent. As a Scuba diver who has been to the Barrier reef and other exotic locations you do not see this number of large fish in one location. So I loved the visit not my first and not my last and highly recommend as a break from retail therapy and perhaps an inspiration to go see these beasts in real life"

We chose the package for AED110 ($US30, 28 Euros) each which gave us a walk through the tunnel, a ride on the glass bottom boat, and entry to the underwater zoo. The tunnel walk through was average (you could see just as well from the outside which is free), the boat was very good, but the underwater zoo was excellent. There was a great collection of animals here, mostly aquatic, and also a section of nocturnal desert animals. It also houses one of the world\u2019s largest captive crocodiles, known as the King Croc, who was moved here from Queensland after menacing the locals. We ended up spending the vast majority of the time at the zoo part and I would rate that alone at 5 stars. Still, a pretty nice (if not cheap) way to spend a couple of hours."

After cancelling another trip we had time to do this attraction. If you are unsure just go! It's not badly priced and you can spend a couple of hours in there. Once you see the huge tank with King Croc words in an aquarium this is the start. Once paid you get to walk through a large tunnel where you can see many types of fish and sharks. You can get brilliant photos if you have a little patience. Before you enter they want you to pose for a photo with a blue screen behind you where they superimpose the tunnel behind you. Don't worry you do not have to buy. After you have done the tunnel they show you the photos and slightly worry that you paid ticket price for just that! But don't worry you need to go up the escalators that are directly opposite and then either enter another part. Here you seen many variety of tanks with many types of fish, Turtles, penguins, crabs and etc.That is when you come across King Croc and his girlfriend. You can not get over how large he is!!! No matter how many times you take a photo it doesn't do his any justice. Go up the stairs and watch the video on why he is in the zoo. He explains why he had to be moved. Then on the second floor there is bats and creepy crawlys which are very interesting. Me and my husband throughly enjoyed it and would recommend anyone to go."

If you are at all interested in marine animals, the Dubai Aquarium is probably worth your time. The aquarium consists of two main areas - an aquarium tunnel and an underwater zoo. These occupy different floors of the mall, with the tunnel downstairs and the underwater zoo upstairs. The tunnel tank can be seen from the mall, so you can get a good feel for whether or not the fish interest you. There is a large viewing area at the main entrance to the aquarium. It will likely be populated with lots of people, but it is roped off so that you cannot get too close without buying a ticket. If you would like a closer view without purchasing a ticket, head up to level one (up the escalator) and you will find a row of windows across from some restaurants at the rear of the tank. These will likely be empty and you can get up close for a good view of the upper reaches of the tank.If the views of the tank from the outside are not enough, you can buy a ticket to enter the tunnel and the underwater zoo upstairs. The tunnel is nice on the inside and offers great views of the fish. There are several large sharks that hang out in the entrance and exit to the tunnel. You won't be able to see these from the outside, so this may be reason enough to purchase an entry. The underwater zoo is nicely arranged and includes a variety of aquatic species. There were a few highlights to the collection. These included the otters, who were busy guarding a baby. This was also my first encounter with archer fish. The aquarium staff have set up hanging targets above the tank. A staff member places food on the target and you can watch as the fish spray water at the target to cause the food to drop. The fish are surprisingly accurate and it is great fun to watch them in action. There is a catwalk above these tanks as well, so you can also get a nice view from above. The final attraction that surprised us was the saltwater crocodile known as \"King Croc.\" This crocodile is every bit as large as advertised. We even got to watch a feeding of the crocodile, and it was truly impressive to see it leap from the water to grab the food and fall with a massive splash.If you have lots of expendable cash, there is no shortage of ways to spend it on additional options. There are several different photo opportunities provided by the staff and you can purchase these at the end of your stay. There are also several combo tickets offering different services. The cheapest entry is the tunnel/ underwater zoo combo ticket for 70 AED per adult (55 AED per child). From here, the ticket options scale up, some including a glass boat ride, behind the scenes tours, or even scuba diving in the main tank. My wife and I only opted for the most basic entry ticket and we were satisfied by what the aquarium had to offer."

This place was amazing especially its inside the mall, so its very handy, the fees can be a bit pricey, as you can see almost everything from outside, free of charge, we chose the platinum? Where you can get the boat ride too? The boat ride was a nice experience where you can get up close and personal with the sharks and stingray. If you love sea creatures then you will enjoy this. If you are a bit skint, just enjoy the outside view."

You can gaze in awe for free at the outside of the main tank which is fab, or pay to walk through the tunnel that goes through it and then visit the underwater zoo. I definitely recommend the latter. They have a large number of sharks, stingrays and other fish of many shapes and sizes which swim over your head. The \"zoo\" is so interesting, with a plethora of fish, amphibians, otters and the star \"King Croc\" - an 800kg male crocodile imported from Australia. It's a great afternoon out, well laid out, informative and fascinating."

The queue was short when we entered it so we managed to pay and get into the tunnel fairly quickly.The tunnel was fairly quiet, lots to see. My boys (7 and 9) enjoyed it a lot, as did my daughter (3). We finished the tunnel pretty quick and went up to the underwater zoo. We lucked out and were stood in front of the sea otters when a trainer came out to feed them. We all loved watching that, having seen the actual sea otter show last time.We slowly meandered through all the tanks, we stood above the tunnel on the glass floor, went up to the creepy crawly section, saw the king croc, watched the penguins. It doesn't take hours, we were there for maybe 90min total, but it's fun. We also had discount vouchers from the Entertainer, I believe giving us 1 adult and 1 child free, so worth the cost. Having been twice now I don't know that it would be on the top of my list of things to do in Dubai but it's well worth a visit for first-timers."

There are also a further two floors with many more fish species to see which is part of the standard ticket price. To get a reduction in the entry cost I believe there is a voucher available in the 2015 Dubai Entertainer book - which is very good value as it will save groups of more than two people a small fortune! 5 stars well worth a visit."

The aquarium tunnel was nice but rather short, then you have to go back into the shopping mall and go up a couple of floors to enter the zoo section (bad planning). The zoo was very busy and too crowded to enjoy. We took the boat ride but the process involved to get to the ride takes 15-20mins and is a real pain, walk here wait, sit there wait, go over there and wait, put a life jacket on and go and sit over there and wait. The ride itself was a boring waste of life. Suggest you take the cheapest package and stick to the tunnel and zoo only."

Then you go up to the second floor where they have the zoo and the rest of the aquarium. Here you'll see different animals that need to live in a water environment and the smaller fishes which are also more exotic. There are also animals that live in the desert. You can buy different tickets, and you can also make a boat tour and dive there. We didn't do that, we only made the regular tour which was more than enough for us."

Animals all seemed healthy and well cared for and there was enough information to be interesting and the guides and staff are very knowledgeable. I wouldn't bother with the fish feeding as it's just in the main aquarium tank and you may as well be throwing pebbles on the scene for what you can see, it was also very rushed and all seemed a bit as if we were in the way.The king croc exhibit was really good fun and something that I've never seen before, in the jungle type or twice across the top of everything else would be great if you had kids with you."

The zoo contains many different species of underwater life including a very impressive crocodile called \"King Croc\"You can spend a couple of hours visiting this attraction so for 110AED including the boat ride it is not too expensive.

The zoo is nice and lots of species but not really much different and of course less complete than a proper zoo. The boat and feeding experience was not really that interesting, plus it takes some time queueing and getting ready just to be on the boat for a couple of minutes, without much explanation or guidance from staff.If you have limited time and money in Dubai I would consider this careful before buying, in my opinion I enjoyed but I think the best is seen from outside, without having to pay anything."

To ask my trusted companions what they thought of the experience in one short sentence. Then, having been jump-started, I'm away, as I weave my own impressions into the fabric of the review. I love to write. It's pleasing to see that other reviewers capture the educational beauty and excitement of this astonishing facility. Anything I have to say merely reflects their views. My advice. Visit Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo. I can find absolutely no fault with it. Money very well spent."

Yes the aquarium is conveniently located in Dubai Mall and buying a ticket and queueing was hassle free. It had a massive billboard saying King Croc on the front alluding that they had this amazing massive salt water crocodile in here. On going in I found the aqua tunnel very short, dark and disappointing. Yes they had a few scary looking sharks and sting rays swimming around amongst the smaller fish but it I expected so much more. After walking through you had to go upstairs to the 2nd floor of the mall to enter the Underwater Zoo. A motley selection of marine fish and animals and then King Croc. What a let down! He was hiding away at the far end of his tank looking totally bored. There was a section on nocturnal land animals, what's that got to do with an aquarium? I booked the glass bottom boat tour aswell, you were ushered onto a cramped boat with 10 other people and I could see next to nothing on the glass bottom as the water was so murky. To be honest it was a waste of time. Not recommended."

The ticket will also give you access to the Underground water zoo - the name may be misleading as this is actually on the second floor of the Dubai Mall. But just the same, it is worth a visit. There are multiple species of each kind making it really nice to look at, plus each tank has good information. One of the crew said that it is still under construction which is why there is no floor map yet and it lacks directional labels inside."

Then when you go upstairs you get to see all sorts of fish and animals, from sharks to otters to penguins. There was every underwater animal you can think of. We paid to go on the boat over the massive fish tank and it was definitely worth it. The boat had a glass bottom so you could see all the sharks, fish and rays swimming underneath you. It was a great day out however it could be modernised a bit and some of the tanks needed the glass cleaning but these were only minor things. I'd definitely recommend if you're in Dubai."

First of all it is laid out in two levels and you have to get out of one and go to the next level to get your tickets checked. Nextly these guys are racists. It is funny because most of the receptionists are Philipinos and the security personnel are Indians and Arabs. In spite of that they will check your tickets multiple times if they see that you are from the sub-continent. They think that you are either a labourer or some other low paid employee just because of your skin colour. When they a see an Westerner they bend over backwards.Guys If you see my other reviews, you will see that I have been around a bit but most of the racist behaviour I have come across is in this part of the world and this is not from Westerners but from my own compatriots.Anyway the aquarium in itself is modest in its collections and fair in its presentation.You can easily give it a pass if you have seen others."

I would not suggest this for children who are rambunctious as there is lots of open water. You will not get wet but you will need eyes on the kids. One area allows you stand over the world's largest alligator in captivity.

This was my first encounter with such an amazing aquarium though the tunnel was bit small as I was expecting bigger. They recently added one more attraction to the family which was a big crocodile. If you haven't seen such aquarium before, then it would be good experience. I would recommend it for all the visitors to have a look."

This aquarium is one of the best we ever saw, the tunnel is not very long and not so interesting than the one in Sydney (Australia), but inside : the zoo ,it is very well organised, with a lot of different animals. It is like if you were in a forest or a river with crocodiles.Nice decoration.Amazing place for children and adults."

My wife and I visited the aquarium and underwater zoo whilst at the mall and now seriously wished we hadn't wasted our cash. You see more from the mall side and only have 10 yards of tunnel to walk through, before you have to go from the ground to 2nd floor to see anything else!! We paid extra for the behind the scenes tour and fish feed. We couldn't hear the guide and I see more action feeding my tropical fish at home than I did here. The King Croc was cool to see, but it looked depressed, which was probably down to the small enclosure and people banging the glass for a reaction. We felt absolutely cheated by the aquarium, there are awful displays, stressed and sad looking animals and bored/rude staff. Dubai has been wonderful apart from this little blip. I repeat DO NOT pay for this. Keep your money and treat yourself to something in the mall, it'll last longer!!"

We did the standard platinum package which included a walk through the aquarium at your own pace followed by a walk through various other sea and wildlife on the second floor of the mall. I am normally afraid of sharks etc but decided to give this aquarium a shot and it was stunning I am glad I did it in Dubai! There were a lot of sharks in the aquarium and we got some really good pictures. The second floor was great and we spent most of our time here looking at the king croc which is humongous along with penguins, various fish and reptiles. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend!"

The aquarium's standard package (platinum) includes a walk through the enormous fish tank, and a display of sea life and nocturnal animals in the mall's 2nd floor.You really can't beat otters but they have some other animals too. Including small penguins, a large crocodile, turtles and some... fish.An aquarium is one of the places where you go \"oh, this is cool, I must take a photo of this!\" but the reality is that there is very little light to get good marine photos. So maybe just enjoy the otters and chameleons and buy the photos from the gift shop :)"

            "review": "Shark Walker Experience. We arrived at our destination. The Dubai Aquarium, situated in the Dubai Mall. Today, even though Annette can't swim, we would be doing the shark walker experience. This involved being lowered into the aquarium in a glass cage while sharks, manta rays and all manner of fish swam past your eyes. We had booked through the extremely Al Boom Diving company who always put safety first.We entered the backstage area of the Attraction and were given our safety briefing by a knowledgable Philippino who took us through the various do's and dont's. After we had satisfied him that we had correctly mastered the hand signals we proceeded to change into our wet suits. I don't know if you've ever put on a wetsuit before but it's like a workout. You have to contort your body into Karma Sutra like positions just to pull it up your body.After all the hard work the result is tremendous. My jelly like body pushed at every seam threatening to tear at the fabric. Flattering they are not. Annette emerged from the dressing room looking far better than I and we set about putting our weighted belts on, this would help us sink to the bottom of the cage.Annette was started to panic now as we took our first tentative steps into the icy water. I went 1st and was quickly in the cage next to the instructor, whilst Annette stood shaking her head at the top of the ladder.The instructor told me to hold the inside bar, not the top ones as I didn't want to lose my fingers to a shark, whilst he went to help Annette. I'm sure bubbles poured from the back of my wetsuit. Once we were both in the water, Annette panicked as her feet couldn't touch the bottom. Also, giant fish were already inside the cage. Let me just explain the basic set up of this cage so you have a clear picture. It's a cage. It has a glass floor and the bottom quarter of all sides is glass too. The top half is all cage, no glass. Fish can swim in and out at will and if you put your hand outside of the cage, it's considered food. Got that? Good, I'll continue.Once we were both in position our helmets were lowered onto our heads and we were submerged.As we descended, all the wonders of the aquarium came into view, Manta Rays as big as blankets glided past the cage effortlessly, fish of all shapes and sizes came up to us for a closer look. Sharks circled as Jaws music played in my head making the occasion that more scary. Annette looked scared as fish entered the cage and the helmets we had on magnified everything.Underneath us people gazed up from a tunnel in the aquarium and to our left thousands of shoppers gawped through an enormous window as our instructor filmed our time under the water.We were dropped lower and a pain developed in my right ear. I had to put my hand underneath my helmet to equalise the pressure in my ears, by holding my nose and blowing until my ears popped.As I held Annette's hand, I mouthed \"Are you okay?\" But she wasn't. She was starting to get pains in her chest. Thankfully the attraction was coming to an end and as the cage rose from the water, our helmets were removed and we pulled ourselves onto dry land.After about 40 minutes, I managed to removed my wet suit with the help of a giant Hawaiian who just happened to be hanging around the locker room in the Dubai Mall. Lucky me.We collected our memory card of our time under the water, thanked our instructor and headed off in search of sustenance. A truly amazing experience that takes you safely into the underwater world, which is safe for swimmers and non swimmers alike."

            "review": "Great Big Mall Pond. The first thing that one sees approaching the Dubai Aquarium from the Dubai Malls main entrance is a short side with the tunnel just to the right and this belies the gigantic side which must have been at least 30 feet high and perhaps 60 or 70 feet wide. Apparently some 20,000 fish reside here and comprising tiger sharks, eagle rays, guitar fish and schools of giant travally, a woebegone or two and certainly made for a fascinating view of the underwater world.Entrance to the aquarium at AED110 per person included traversing the tunnel directly underneath this huge fish tank, access to the underwater zoo and a glass bottom boat ride and fish feeding, although this comprised the boat 'guide' tossing four pieces of fish into the water for the schooling GTs.The underwater zoo proved a little more interesting and covered a range of fresh and salt water species and the highlight of which is a five metre long crocodile.Interesting subjects included king crabs, a lung fish, otters, and a small cooly of penguins although I couldn't find the literature on what species they were.If you happen to be at the Dubai Mall, do drop by for an interesting 1-1.5 hours of some pretty fascinating creatures. And oh, if you're so inclined and have around AED300, they'll even let you scuba dive in the giant pool!"

It covers three floors and everybody gets to see the fish in action without paying.The bit you pay for takes you into the Zoo and close ups of tropical creatures including crocodiles , pengiuns and undersea animals and fishes.There is also a boat trip above the aquarium where you are up close and personal with sharks and Giant Trevalley. The boat trip needs more activity in my view, such as a commentary. You also have access to the undersea tunnel where huge fish swim over you.On reflection I probably would not do the ZOO bit if I was to do it again."

Nestled inside the Dubai Mall, a mall that not only covets the title for \"world's largest\", but also is home to the aquarium, a massive dinosaur skeleton, the cliff diving fountain, an ice skating rink, and so much more, can easily take you 2 days to see it all. But you didn't click on this to read about the mall. I only touch on it because it is so wild to experience this attraction in the midst of people eating cheesecake and buying shoes mere meters away from you!Anywho, this attraction, firstly, is a very high value. At just 70AED, you can easily be entertained for 2 hours. You start off from the outside observing the massive glass window of underwater specimens before you dive deep into the tunnel where you get a closer look at the creatures from the depths. Once you are done with that experience, you head upstairs to see fish and other creatures from around the world in a beautiful display of nature mixed with artificial plant-life.Finishing off the experience, you will pass by King Croc, a massively recognizable crocodile as one of the biggest in the world. Head into the less impressive animals of the deserts surrounding the UAE, and your tour will come to an end.Throughout the experience there are toilets and opportunities to buy some snacks and such.The biggest flaw that I saw is how confusing and over-crowded the inside area can get. They definitely need to improve their signage as well as there crowd-control. I would love to see them make it more informative and interactive as well.Thus, I suggest allowing 2 hours for this experience and being satisfied with the 70AED option.

We also went for a boat ride, where you can look down into the aquarium. The boat ride was good but was for a very small time.The only thing that I disliked was that they took our family photo at the entrance, without informing that we'll have to buy it at the exit for 150 AED.

It is quite big in there and on several levels. I opted to feed the fish as well, and whilst not a long experience, it was fun.The biggest surprise was the other bits. Not so much \"underwater\" zoo, but reptiles, bird, insects and the star of the show - King Croc.Was really deceiving from the outside how much was available to see on the inside. They probably should rethink how they \"sell\" this attraction as I thought it was just underwater creatures. Very little was said about the above ground critters (and bigger)Worth the money and took a good couple of hours to see it all quickly.

The first dive was an orientation and we stopped and knelt at the bottom of the aquarium at 4 different locations to watch the fish/sharks swim past. They get so close! It's amazing to be inside and see people watching from outside and in the tunnel.The second dive was all about identifying the different breeds and photography-getting the perfect photos of us and the sharks. We got some really amazing photographs. The third dive was in the shark cage, which was a bit daunting! Two staff fed the sharks with fish on poles through the bars, it was fascinating watching the sharks come in for the kill!Overall I would recommend this activity for any divers, it's a must see- a shark swimming straight for you! If you're not PADI qualified you can still snorkel or use a bubble helmet. Well worth every penny!x"

We paid quickly, we got in quickly and the tunnel is quite small so it's like a traffic jam to be fair, but you get used to it, and my children's eyes were popping out at all the animals they could see above them, next to them, all around them! Lots of great photos of smiling children and cheeky sharks and sting rays. The aquarium itself only takes about 20 minutes to cover, but then you go up to Level 2 for the underwater zoo. We chose the fish feeding package for an extra AED 10 per person so our kids could interact with fish. Note: while Dubai Malls free prams are a godsend for the Mall itself, the aquarium and underwater zoo are not child friendly; the underwater zoo was great with the otters, fish, crocs, penguins et al; again for the children there was wow.We fed the fish, that was a little bit of fun, but you drop the food from 5 meters above the fish and we couldn't really understand what the guide was saying, so you could probably go either way with the optional extras.All up, a great 90 minutes or so for us and our children; on top of what you can see externally as a non-paying visitor, well worth the memories. If we didn't have children we probably wouldn't of done it, a lot of people have commented on other aquariums around the world, but say what you say, it is unique."

The aquarium is pretty cool and the up close view you get going through the tunnel is definitely a different experience than the \"free view\" you get in the mall. The underwater zoo is what makes it more worth the cost though. There are quite a few things to see in the underwater zoo. From the giant croc to the river otters it is a pretty fun stop for a family with small children. They have quite a variety of things to see for the family. On the downside they do take photos and then try to charge pretty crazy prices if you would like to order them. I would have actually liked a print but the prices were just too high and then they are going to turn around a throw away the print they made? This sort of thing always bugs me a bit. Overall I don't think it was a great value compared to other aquariums but it was a nice way to pass some time given the high price tag on many things in this area it seemed like a reasonable price overall especially with the gift store credit you get with your ticket purchase."

Once you pay the entry fee, you are allowed to walk by the aquarium from the outside and take pictures, then make a turn where they take pictures with you (which you can buy later for a hefty fee). You can then walk kind of inside the aquarium through a tunnel where you see water everywhere. It's roughly 25 meters long and that's it from the aquarium. You then proceed to the 2nd floor for the underwater zoo where you see different fish, crabs and crocodiles. On the upper floor, there were additional animals like owls and others that are active at night. It can be very crowded at times as it's not a huge area but a lot of things packed into a small room.

If you enjoy watching sharks and rays face to face you and your little ones will truely enjoy amazing aquarium. This underwater zoo is the best I seen in my life full of 1000's of underwater sea creatures. Your visit should include the walk upstairs to see the main tank or even a dive in the aquarium once you completed the training a great experience for anyone."

There are are several large sharks which swim next to the glass tunnel and the giant Manta Ray is something to behold. On the second level there are smaller tanks with more exotic fish, turtles, king crabs (about a metre in size), and penguins. The star of the show is the crocodile; there is a life size replica at the entrance but you only appreciate its size and power when looking at the real thing in its tank.Great place to go even if you're on a tight schedule as it will take about an hour to view everything (depending on how quickly you want to walk)."

The underwater tunnel gives great views, lots of sharks, rays & interesting fish to see, & the aqua zoo kept us entertained with all there was to see. Our daughter particularly enjoyed seeing the penguins, otters & turtles. We fed the fish & went on the short tour to see behind the scenes. Would have liked to go on to the water in the glass bottomed boat but our little one too young for that, so another time (think minimum age was 3 - am told well worth doing if you can). King Croc very impressive (over 5m long), but did feel the staff didn't know too much about the animal - I'd asked if he & his partner had had babies / if they'd lived together in the wild or been caught together etc, & didn't get the impression that they knew the answers... But other than that, a really good way to spend a couple of hours, we felt good value for money, & our daughter really enjoyed it."

It was very short, and the alot of the aquarium can be seen from the outside for free. There was nothing very special or unique about it. If you ONLY wanted to see the aquarium, I highly recommend you DO NOT buy a ticket. Just look from the outside in the mall.The salesperson outside the aquarium, sold us the most expensive package without discussing the contents of the package we were purchasing or even mention the other cheaper packages and what they offer. It went like this: \"How much does it cost to enter the aquarium tunnel?\" \"110 dirhams each\". We only knew of the cheaper packages later on. It felt quite dishonest really. The Underwater Zoo was certainly better, but nothing special compared to other aquariums I've been to in other parts of the world. Fortunately our 'Ultimate Package' got us into a number of sub-attractions including a glass-bottom boat ride, fish feeding tour, and 20AED vouchers per person redeemable at their gift shop.The glass-bottom boat tour guide didn't look very passionate in what she was doing. It was like she didn't even want to be there. Our fish tour guide was good, but very short.So to sum up:- Dubai Aquarium: Bad value, not recommended- Underwater Zoo: Some ups and downs, overall was worth it."

Although visitors to the Dubai Mall can see lots of fish swimming around without paying to go inside the Aquarium, the inside displays and creatures found in this part of the world are quite interesting, lots of colourful exhibits from those living in the sand environment to water and airborne animals and mammals. Well worth the 80AED entrance fee, although when you are given 20AED as a voucher to spend in the Aquarium shop at the end of your visit, the t-shirts and usual tourist items are quite expensive, and the only thing you might get for the 20 AED might be a pencil or eraser, so a cheaper ticket would be more useful. Good entertainment for children fed up with shopping for maybe 90 minutes. Also a little awkward logistically as you have to keep your entry ticket after leaving the viewing tunnel to then go out, up the escalator, and then back in the upper floor to see the other exhibits.

There is so much to see and the sheer size of the aquarium and being so close to the sharks and fish is amazing. Children will love it and you are able to take some fantastic pictures as you are so close to everything. My personal favourite was the penguins but plenty to keep everyone occupied."

But the experience does not let you down. You first go through the conveyor belt tunnel with underwater life coming alive in full splendour. You enjoy taking pics with Sting Rays and huge sharks really Up close and personal. Then you take the escalator to the second floor and you find the zoo ...yes a full fledged zoo in a mall!!!the king croc is a major attraction here...hats off to the Mall Management ...moving such a huge croc inside the mall requires some kind of an effort. Enjoy the Great display of a wide range of marine life."

Conveniently located in Dubai Mall, it's the perfect way to kill a few hours from the relentless summer heat ! Yes, it was 43 C outside. To say the least it wasn't cheap If it was very reasonably priced and our 2 for 1 entertainer vouchers made it even better. Just from the outside alone you can see how big the 'biggest aquarium in the world' actually is and together with it's underwater tunnel you can get a really feeling of being in the ocean. Everything is well looked after and themed very well on several floors. With it's multitude of animals from fish to penguins to crocodiles it's just incredible. The aquarium is incredibly big, clean and there are presentations several times a day. And it makes it a perfect spot for photography with perfectly blended colors and carefully controlled lighting. On the upper floors they even have a reptile house and various other attractions to keep you entertained.We visited the Lost Chambers aquarium at the Atlantis hotel in December 2010, so I think it's a close one !"

However 80D is not a lot to spend to go through the tunnel. It was amazing to see the fish lying on the tunnel floor.On a negative side - being in the Dubai Mall, you would expect that everything is ligit, but having some 'kid' (who is not a photographer) to take photo's of you when you are in the tunnel and then have them charge you 275 D for the photo afterwards is not acceptable.

The aquarium is huge (two floors) and can see various fishes including sharks. The tunnel is also nice, kids will really enjoy. There are three different tickets AED 80, 90 & 110 and you get AED 10 per ticket to buy anything from the souvenir shop. Once you are out of tunnel then move to second floor using escalators and enter into the underwater zoo which has many aquariums with various see creatures. Do not miss different colored jelly fishes, king crock & penguins. If you are with kids then this is a must see place in Dubai, overall a very nice place to spend couple of hours."

You get a great (free) view of the aquarium from inside the Dubai shopping mall where you will see plenty different species of shark and ray and various other fish. However, I would recommend paying the entrance fee (AED 70/90) and seeing the inner aquarium tunnel and zoo. The inner tunnel gives you an up close and personal view where you will get some amazing pictures. The zoo contains a large selection of tropical fish, otters, penguins, crocodiles and even desert creatures; scorpions, camel spiders, chameleons to name a few. You could easily fly through the entire zoo in under an hour but it should take 2 hours max at a leisurely pace to complete the entire attraction, taking in every single fish tank and animal enclosure.The only point to be wary of is the lowest entrance fee. The official website (http://www.thedubaiaquarium.com/en/Visitus/TicketInformation.aspx) shows that ticket prices start at AED 70 for adults, yet this price is nowhere to be seen at the actual ticket counter! The minimum package listed costs AED 90 which includes an AED 20 voucher for the gift shop; I don't like the way you are pretty much forced to pay for the AED 20 voucher! Another reviewer did say that if you are stern enough at the counter you can demand the lower entrance fee, without the gift shop voucher, so just something to be aware of. Overall great experience and would highly recommend"

The Dubai aquarium is the worlds largest water tank with thousands of fishes located near the entrance of the Dubia mall.The aquarium is free to watch for all the mall visitors at a distance and looks massive with blue water and big fishes. If you want to go near then entrance fee is applicable. The entry has various options ... aquarium, underwater zoo and the boat ride.The aquarium is massive and has various shark and swordfish species along with other fishes. If you take the ticket, then you can go through the tunnel. The tunnel is not very long but provides a unique experience. Next stop is the underwater zoo on the higher level and provides all other animals. Not to miss out the giant crabs, jellyfish, crocodiles and alligators, penguins and many others.The best part of the aquarium is to enjoy a very short boat ride which is basically a transparent base boat ride on the top of the aquarium tank and last for about 10 minutes. The boat executive are very courteous and open to answering all questions. during the boat ride, one could see all the sharks and fishes beneath.Surely a must visit for all visitors coming to Dubai. Entire visit might take 2 hours.Can get crowded and hence plan in the first half of the day."

The underwater tunnel is not too exciting - photos can also be hard to take against the curved surface. As you enter, a photo of you is taken (optional) which is very overpriced for what it is. How can these attractions get away with it! Glass bottom boat is very poor. Your in the roof space dragged around by an attendant who (in our case) didn't really speak to us. Glass bottom was wet and dirty so couldn't see clearly down. Zoo area was much bigger than we anticipated at first - some exhibitions are great, but as others have said the penguins and crocodile areas don't look too appealing - have seen much better conditions in the UK. Overall, if you have nothing better to do or want a break from shopping it's worth a visit but don't expect to go away mind blown - it was all just ok. Note that when we visited the pricing structures were quite complicated and the staff were not helpful (very rushed) in helping us choose which package to go for. "

It has a huge collection of marine animals, 2 crocodiles and night desert animals.Now why did I give it a poor rating, two reasons:1. I have visited other oceanariums, same old stuff and nothing extra ordinary. 2. The cashier lacks proper training in handling customer queries, before I bought the ticket, I have mentioned that I have been to other oceanariums. She still sells me the VIP package, she reaffirmed me that I'll be impress. Although the personal guide and the tour was OK, it did not met my expectations. I already know half of the marine animals on display so having a guide telling me each and everything was no longer enjoyable. And lastly, tours were not fluid, meaning we have to go to the same place over and over again just to get to the next display. In conclusion, do not get the VIP Package if your not new to this kind of place. just get the basic package because their is nothing to miss."

This is a quality tourism attraction fully enclosed in amongst the shops. It is a pleasant distraction after hours of shopping to break your day up and do a tour of the aquarium and Zoo. The aquarium has a great tunnel through the middle so you feel like you are walking amongst the fish & sharks. The size a variety of sea creatures is impressive and interesting and if you have time you can pay extra to feed the fish or dive in amongst them. The underwater Zoo is also impressive with its setup and variety of animals from crocodiles (imported from Australia) to penguins, fish and much more. Definitely worth the visit if you are in the area a you will need at least an hour or more to see it properly."

I address this post to the responsible managers of this aquarium to at least re-place the penguins, owls and other birds and make Dubai a more sustainable place. How about using the space of this dreadful aquarium to teach children about bio-diversity and the distinction of our precious species? Our 2 children actually started crying when they saw those beautiful white owls sitting in that dark hole with nowhere to spread their wings to. I urge you to show mercy and re-place these poor creatures. It may not make a huge difference to the world but it would make the world to that crocodile, that lizard we saw endlessly climbing up the glass wall in a desperate attempt to escape and those magnificent snow owls staring into the empty.

The King Croc was feeding when we were there, great to see such a huge creature so close up; and the section on 'UAE's Night Creatures' was also good. Not what you expect to see in an underwater zoo, but nice to see local wildlife featured. The tunnel through the aquarium gives a great chance to get up close to the sharks - they seem to hang out here rather than at the front of the aquarium you can see from the mall.

We chose the ultimate package which included a glass bottom boat trip on top of the aquarium which we got to see great white sharks sleeping beneath our feet with a whole load of other sharks and tropical fish! brilliant adventure. With this package you also get 20 Dirhams complementary to spend in the gift shop which is nice! The walk through aquarium is brilliant walking through the tunnel and getting loads of pictures was brilliant! definitely worth the trip a great experience! definitely recommend! :)"

            "review": "Great Aquarium. Being a UAE resident I have passed the aquarium within Dubai Mall on many occasions, but never once been inside. I had heard that you can see as much from the outside as you can within...Recently I had visitors from the UK and they wanted to go to the aquarium and underwater zoo as part of their trip to Dubai. I must say that despite being dubious about what you would be able to see and value for money, it was definitely a worthwhile experience.The aquarium tunnel is a fully immersive experience and if you time your visit right you can see the sharks being fed which is amazing. Getting up close to the marine creatures especially the rays was awesome.Once you have completed your walk through the tunnel you take the escalator up to the underwater zoo where you can see tanks of fish and other animals such as otters and water rats, the whole exhibit is themed to look like a jungle and is really well done with rope bridges and suspended walkways which your children will love. The newest edition to the zoo section is the king crocodile which is absolutely huge and housed in a large display which can be viewed from underwater or above. There is also a section with penguins and a nocturnal walk through of UAE night animals.The whole experience is a nice way to kill an hour or two and is larger than the lost chambers aquarium out at Atlantis. Overall for the 80 AED entrance fee I would recommend a visit."

            "review": "Not bad, but certainly not the greatest either. There seems to be some confusion as to what admission to the aquarium actually entails...to clear this up now: YOU DO GET MORE THAN THE WALK-THROUGH TUNNEL WITH YOUR TICKET!! This seems to be very confusing to some, and to be fair, the signage is not clear, but after you pay for your ticket and walk through the tunnel, you continue on up the escalators and go to the rest of the aquarium and especially the \"underwater zoo\". Remember, after passing through the tunnel, don't just walk back into the mall! Keep on going (follow the rest of the ticketed crowd,especially if they are going up the escalator!) and you won't miss out on what your ticket includes, OK? GOT IT?Now that this problem is cleared up...The real treat of the Dubai Aquarium is the amazingly gigantic main tank that can be viewed for free, as long as you stay behind the ropes. Virtually all of the best fish on display can be seen if you are patient and just stand and observe for awhile. If you feel that you simply MUST see more fish and whatever else they have hidden away in this aquarium, then you have a few choices: the cheapest ticket gets you into the rest of the aquarium and \"zoo\", for an additional fee, you can take a glass bottom boat ride on top of the huge tank to get a different perspective of the same fish. Finally, for an even higher fee (and if you are a certified diver) you can get real up-close and personal with the same fish by diving down into the same above mentioned tank.Like many other reviewers, our family went with the cheapest option. (NOTE: this is not actually listed at the ticket counter, you have to ask for the basic entrance choice) This got us closer to the main tank (on the \"paying side\" of the ropes) granted us entrance into the tunnel that takes you through the tank (cool views, especially of the sharks) and then UPSTAIRS to see the rest of the smaller tanks of assorted fish and enclosures of small creatures. The website, and especially other reviews and photos, pretty much show you literally everything there is to see. The rest of the fish \"collection\" is interesting, but nothing out of the ordinary. The \"zoo\" is a very limited selection of some night creatures, penguins in a too small enclosure (same for the otters) and some birds. Not exactly a \"zoo\", but it is just as well as I can't imagine subjecting anything but fish to a life inside a shopping mall. The biggest non-fish attraction is the KING CROC...who is joined by some smaller crocodile \"friends\" in his little pond. He is big. He is scary. You can watch him eat.I have been to world class aquariums in various countries (my daughter is quite the aficionado,seeing to it that I don't miss out!) and so I speak from experience when I say that this is in no way the best aquarium in the world, not even 2nd or 3rd...it is just average, but happens to have a super large main tank that is super cool AND it is located in the biggest mall in the world. If that appeals to you, then by all means go, if not, then enjoy the free view from the \"other\" side of the ropes and keep on shopping"

There is a rope to prevent anyone from getting near the glass, unless you pay for the tunnel experience.If you decide to go inside the tunnel, you will see it's very short and may not be worth the money, if you don't get the glass bottom boat ride, top floor. You can get a good view on the backside of the aquarium, just go up one floor and it's in front of Macaroni grill. It looks as if you are going into the restaurant but there is a small walkway there for you to take more pictures and you are right next to the glass. They do have Visa credit card specials so make sure to ask or they will just charge regular price. There is also a pretty good sea exhibition at the top floor, same place as the glass bottom boat. Finally if you are SCUBA certified, you can go dive there with a guide and it's something super special. They will provide all the gear and safety briefing. I did it when they first opened and it was very special for me as my family was there watching me inside the aquarium, with the fish and sharks passing by. It was a great experience and the crew keeps an eye of everything. Hope you enjoy the world record holding Dubai Aquarium. Enjoy!"

The aquarium is located right in the middle of the Dubai Mall, making it a good point of reference for people trying to figure out where they are in the massive shopping complex. The main part of the aquarium is a multi-story tank with a walkway running through the middle of it. Upstairs one can get in small boats with see-through bottoms that run a short track around the top of the main tank. There is a separate area with numerous smaller tanks containing fish, jellyfish, and an area with penguins and what supposedly is the world's largest captive crocodile. An interesting experience, perhaps more suited for kids than adults, as there was relatively less info on the various species there than I've seen elsewhere. And the guide during the brief boat tour spoke so quietly and with a strong accent that at first we weren't sure what language she was speaking."

If you're coming in to view this attraction, just do it outside please. The ticket is overpriced and not worth the inside visit. However, they do have varieties of fish and the most scariest was the shark. Not one, not two but several. Besides walking thru the inside tube, there's also other ways to view the aquarium (which I did not do) such as riding a boat with glass bottom or diving with gear to feed the fishes."

There were some barn owls stuck in this small enclosure looking sorry for themselves, with no space to fly and hunt, fruit bats in the same predicament. The penguins had been moved to a smaller enclosure to make way for King Croc and they all looked bored. Was disappointed this visit because I felt it was cruel keeping some of the animals in the enclosures they were in. I only hope that the birds in there get a chance to fly around sometime. I won't be visiting again."

It's built so that the aquarium wall from the mall side is impressive, taking up several floors, so if you are on family budget holiday you could spend a while just looking here. As a diver, I found out the tank dive with videos was equivalent \u00a3170. Having paid more than that for awful European weekend dives to look at rocks, hanging out with two dozen sharks for half an hour was well worth it! And yes, after all my moaning I was waving to the crowds in the mall from INSIDE the aquarium! I think they must have some sort if shark breeding programme as my friends went recently too and got to see shark eggs in the tank which were very cool to see. Worth asking about. Oh for the record it's all artificial, reefs and decent diving actually in Dubai is nonexistent, I think there is so much waste from construction coming off shore it ruins anything you may have seen."

If you visit Dubai there are many other attractions to see. If you have been to other big aquariums, there is no reason to visit this one. Nothing special about it. The underwater zoo is a short exhibition of marine life and some reptiles. The big croc, like crocs usually do, is lying there completely motionless, easily to be confused with a statue. If you haven't been in such a place before, then do visit the aquarium, taking the cheapest ticket at Dirhams 80, which gives you a walk through the tunnel and a visit to the underwater zoo."

From otters and sea rats to tiny tropical fish and the most enormous king crocodile I've ever seen. The staff were friendly and informative, especially the star fish and crocodile area and seemed to take so much care of the marine life.

There is a separate fee for the Dubai Aquarium and the Underwater Zoo, The fee for the underwater zoo is on the higher side. But, I wouldn't recommend spending money to visit the aquarium inside if you are in the pursuit of unique breeds of fishes. There is not much of difference than the varieties of fishes outside the aquariums than inside the aquarium for what you are supposed to pay for. But, I strongly exhort visiting the Underwater Zoo it is worth a visit although the price is on the higher side but I wouldn't consider the visit exorbitant. Excellent place in overall."

The rest of the marine life was definitely interesting and fascinating to watch. I could literally spend hours and hours here and then coming out with a sore neck. The glass bottom boat was a bit of a let down though, although after several minutes in a small \"almost flimsy\" boat it did dawn on me that, hang on, those sharks that I saw earlier were actually somewhere down below! Slightly daunting. Walking around the rest of the zoo was also very good and interesting. The diversity of all the marine life and the effort the people make to preserve the lives of these marine animals must be applauded. Very unique and special day out."

There are circa 70 sharks in the tank too and it's amazing to walk through the tunnel and see them swimming over the top of you. The boat trip is worth doing too. It's only 5 mins or so but interesting to look down and see all the fish below. Why spoilt? Well sorry but the zoo is awful from the welfare point of view. Sure all the animals are well kept but I fail to see the point of taking two crocodiles from their natural habitat and sticking them in a small tank/enclosure. The video commentary basically tells how the aquarium manager had an idea to bring crocs and thought it would draw the crowds. Yes that's right it is all about getting people in at any cost to the wild animals. Now the poor crocs will spend the rest of their lives in captivity. There was nothing wrong with them, they were not in danger, so why move them to Dubai? Money! I find this quite sad. I am all for saving and rescuing when there is a need but in this case it was driven by commercial gain. So the fact is I went and part of me enjoyed it but I can't help feeling a crocodile is a wild animal that should have stayed in the wild. Why not take one born in captivity?On this basis I would refuse to go again. I did not realise the crocs were there or their story."

We declined as we felt it was too expensive. The staff became rather dismissive at this point and barely registered us when we asked for directions to the underwater zoo, a point in the general direction was what we got! Not very friendly. The underwater zoo was busy with people enjoying themselves. The signs were informative and there were a few interaction stations. We didn't partake in this but we could see others enjoying it.

Bought a ticket which gives you entrance into the tunnel where they give you a talk on the aquarium and it's marine life. We also had a glass bottom boat ride on the top of the aquarium which gives a different perspective as you are looking down on the people in the mall. The aquarium also has otters, beavers and an enormous crocodile. Definitely worth a visit."

We took the tour @ 110 AED with the glass bottom boat ride (indoor).Of course it is wonderful to be able to walk below water, but for 80 AED (activity only), you expect a bit more than going through a fish tank of 30m, at least I did.Underwater zoo as many varieties of fishes, playful otters, sad king croc, and an overcrowded penguins box.Boat ride was not impressive and not worth the extra 30 AED.Advice to people who are thinking to dive in the tank: we thought about it, I would prefer to dive pay extra 300 AED and go open water than dive in such a small fish tank: only good if you want to brag about it with your friends: go open water, you will find rewarded any fished :)"

We purchase the ticket which include the tour by the boat that got a glassy ground on it at the bottom, and we came back for the second time and took the ticket that include fish feeding. There is this new citizen of this underwater zoo which is the 5 metre length crocodile, we could see the croc from the mezzanine level upstairs of its cage which is glass transparent at its ground, so it is quite chilly especially when the crocs are there beneath us. I guess the ticket price are reasonable enough as we could see so many underwater species of fishes and many more.The tank itself can compete with the Osaka aquarium at Japan which is also beautiful. I recommend it a must visit place at Dubai Mall if you happened to be around this mall and have quite a time to kill."

You can add on all sorts of interesting activities from the basic glass bottomed boat to Scuba diving. We did not have a lot of time, so spent only about an hour here. The aquarium itself is the world's largest fish tank and gives you the nice opportunity to walk through the tunnel surrounded by sharks, sting rays and several other equally interesting fish. You can get a similar view from outside the aquarium for free but it does not quite give you the photo op of being inside the tunnel. And of course you don't get to see the underwater zoo.Once you pass through the tunnel, you go up a couple of levels to get to the underwater zoo, which we were pleasantly surprised by. Plenty of aquatic and amphibian species from all over the world, displays were very nice. The piece de resistance had to be the shark eggs with the embryo throbbing inside. The descriptions of the displays could do with some updating and better detailing, but all in all it was an interesting experience.Worth a visit especially if you have children with you."

It looked great from the outside and I personally thought that was the best part and the fact that it was in a shopping mall.You can tell that the kids really enjoyed the experience, especially the tunnel part. The aquarium itself is not big and it's not an attraction that would take hours to go through, i think we only spent about 40 minutes to go through the entire place. It's worth a visit if you have young children, otherwise I would say this can be skipped (especially given the price)."

And the sharks seemed to prefer the unlit recesses, rather than the brighter more photogenic areas.But then we were sent upstairs to the Underwater Zoo, included in the price and 2 storeys up at the top of the Dubai Mall, and all our worries melted away as we got close to really interesting creatures such as Otters and Platypus."

The best part of the this was walking through the tunnel and seeing all the sharks and rays - and going early in the morning 10 am (during the work week) when it just opens is even better as it's pretty empty and you can get some good pics!! After your walk through here you have to go up the escalator to the second floor and there you enter the rest of the aquarium. For as big as everything is in Dubai and how much everything is generally overdone, it seems they skipped that in the Aquarium. It was okay and yes you could see some cool sea life, but it's quite small and I felt that there really wasn't much to it. You could walk through it quite quickly and I left feeling very unimpressed. I would say this attraction is better for families with kids and not for couples or individual travelers."

The tunnel is the coolest part of the attraction but a bit short lived. There are more fish on the second floor to see but after 10 minutes, my 5 yr old was bored. Beware of the up selling of behind the scenes and feeding the fish as we didn't find these activities worth it. Save a few bucks and look at the fish from the mall - the experience is just as impressive. If your really into marine life, spend the money on the dolphin adventure at Atlantis."

To start with I can\u2019t understand why they call it \u201caquarium and underwater zoo\u201d? It\u2019s an aquarium and what they sell separately as the underwater zoo should also be a part of the aquarium. Anyway we bought the Ultimate Aquarium Package at AED 110 which included 1) Aquarium Tunnel 2) Underwater Zoo 3) Glass-bottom Boat ride and 4) Aquarium gift voucher worth AED 20. They very conveniently didn\u2019t show me the option which is just for the tunnel and the zoo. Considering the glass-bottom boat ride is waste of time and the gift voucher is just a push sell (you can always buy from the gift shop on your own) I would recommend that you insist upon the simple combo ticket which is just for the tunnel and the zoo and costs AED 70 only. As I said the glass-bottom boat ride is waste of time\u2026 What they call the Zoo is what you would see in any regular Aquarium. It\u2019s a small place\u2026 you just need 15 to 20 mins to see the whole place. But they have good collection of species. They must do something about the stench around the place though. The highlight of the place is the acrylic panelled aquarium tank. The 32.88M x 8.3M side viewing panels are not world\u2019s largest, as they would make you believe, but it\u2019s certainly worth seeing. You can see the whole tank from outside standing on the corridors of Level-2 and Level-1 of the mall. But, you must enter the tunnel at the bottom of the tank to get the best of it\u2026 particularly if haven\u2019t been to any other tunnel aquarium. Also you can see a lot more aquatic activity inside the tunnel than you can see from outside. The tunnel itself is not huge\u2026 I have seen three times longer tunnel in Shanghai Aquarium. But as I said if it\u2019s your first visit to a tunnel aquarium I am sure you will love it. Overall I would say it was an enjoyable experience. The gift shops are rip-offs\u2026 just ignore them. Since I had three AED20 vouchers I was forced to buy some exorbitantly overpriced stuff\u2026There are different underwater diving activities but I would recommend to avoid them\u2026 If you want to experience the real thrill of underwater diving then go to the sea\u2026 you won\u2019t get that in a fish tank!"

There are some who say that the sharks are too big for the aquarium, but they looked happy to me! My husband (a civil engineer specialising in water) was amazed at how that huge amount of water could be contained in the aquarium. And the \"zoo\" - well fantastic too - all the fish look happy and well looked after. We were delighted that it rained in Dubai that day, so that we decided to go to the Dubai mall. The aquarium was well worth the \u00a315 each that we paid. Oh what fun"

They promote it as the largest aquarium in the world, but it really is small compared to EPCOT or the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. Arrived and we were greeted by friendly and knowledgeable staff. Their equipment is in great shape and they do a pretty good job. The educational program is lacking compared to stateside aquariums. It is a thirty minute dive and costs about $180.00 (US). All the coral in the aquarium is fake, painted cement, the rocks are real. If you are not comfortable in the water, the dive guides will drag you around the aquarium by your tank and set you in places they want you to sit and look at the fish. Fortunately as an experienced diver this was not an issue for me. I would recommend visiting the aquarium and looking at all the great fish and rays through the glass. Getting in the water is cool, but just not a top pick for me when visiting Dubai. Use your money to go the top of the tallest building in the world!"

While it was quite amazing to see the fish and sharks etc in the aquarium so close up I had a real sense that they were swimming mindlessly up and down, it was smaller than I thought it would be. The zoo however was the saddest and most upsetting thing I have seen for such a long time. It is all very well to be able to see these fish and creatures up close but to what cost. I even fely sorry for the fish who were packed into small tanks. Children were banging on the glass and the noise and lights were pretty bad, but then we came to the otters, beavers and in particular the penguins. I defy anyone to say that this was a fair enviroment for them. Agaian the relentless noise and lights etc, but mostly the size of the enclosures/homes was terrible. The penguins were the saddest, standing around in a tiny enclosure. How nice for us to see them up close but how horrible for them. It reminded me of the scene in Happy Feet when Happy Feet finds himself in the zoo where all the other penguins have become like robots as they are so bored and confined. A mall for a zoo if horrible and while some may argue that they could be worse it doesn't justify it for me. My husband and I bothe felt moved to tears to see such beautiful creatures in this enviroment....all so children and adults can get a thrill of seeing something so cute close up. It was horrible."

You can see it for free from behind the rope or if you go to the first floor you can see it up close (but most of the fish don't go that high) Cheapest option is about \u20ac16. Your ticket gives you \u20ac2 off at the gift shop. And there are a few things for about the price so no extra spend is required. (It's not \u20ac2 off per transaction or item so if more than one you can get all \u20ac2's off 1 item. Hope that makes sense)It's great to see the fish up close from the outside. You feel like there's nothing separating you. When you move past the outside you come back through the tunnel. It takes a bit of getting used to as the curve plays tricks with your vision. Saw many more of the sharks from inside the tunnel than I did from the outside. Well worth the time and the money."

The ticket lets you visit both the aquarium and \"zoo\".The Aquarium: It is huge and has interesting fish. Going through the tunnel is interesting but you see most of the fish OUTSIDE (for free) than you do on the inside. It is a maximum 3 minute stroll in the tunnel. When you first walk in, your picture is taken and you're asked to collect when you leave. The picture is filthy expensive! Its a rip-off! They first wanted to charge me 220AED/60$ for one copy with a fancy shmancy (plastic) frame. Then the salesperson said if I take a key chain for 95AED/26$ I'll get the pic for free but its the size of half my mobile phone. Again, rip off rip off..The Zoo: you go to the second floor for this and as soon as you step off of the escalator you can smell the rancid seawater smell. It is horrendous. I had to spray perfume on my hand and swab under my nose to not smell it but it was useless. Once inside, the aquariums are nice and plenty of fish to see. My favorite were the angel fish, the jelly fish and of course, the Penguins!!

Though my mum was a bit bored, my sister and i totally went insane when we saw the live sharks, turtles, \"Finding Nemo\" themed aquarium, Shark eggs, Sea horses, Range of star fish, otters, penguins - you name it! It's definitely a unique experience but i am sure it could have been less expensive."

This was our first visit to Dubai and our family was eager to visit the much recommended Aquarium in the Dubai Mall. The experience was one large tourist trap within a mall and there are better aquariums around the wall and even in the Lost Chamber at Atlantis Dubai. But we were most SHAMED AND INCENSED when the Aquarium store, at the exit of the Aquarium, forced us to purchase an unwanted toy that our child had supposedly broken.The toy was obviously already broken and put back on the shelf. Our innocent daughter of 10 years old had the misfortune to touch it and it immediately fell off the shelf onto the ground. As the staff was adamant that we pay for it (a 40 AED whale grabber) and we refused, the dimunitive local store manager called security. They threatened to haul my husband away for disrespecting him. All this happened in front of our two children who were so scared that they were almost in tears. Even though we proved that our daughter could not have broken the toy (it turns out that it was missing parts, was already broken before she happened upon it and another perfectly fine item when dropped on the floor did not break), the store manager insisted that we pay for it or else... We have never encountered such an UNREASONABLE store manager who just used the THREAT OF SECURITY AND WORST PRISON to get us to pay for something. Having travelled the entire world, we have never come across such an unacceptable situation and paid as we did not want to end up in an Arab jail for no reason. For this and many other reasons, I would not patronize this Aquarium, the Dubai Mall or for that reason the region."

In fact, I enjoyed it, I absolutely loved it. I could spend the whole day just watching the enormous tank filled with the spectacular range of underwater species. It was breathtaking. Everyone in my family (my husband, my two girls, my parents) was in awe at this attraction located inside the Dubai Mall. There were lots of bystanders watching the marine life, and taking photos of it. However, it is best that you go inside the tunnel to see them up close. The underwater zoo may not be as grand as the Dubai Aquarium but offers unique species in their own aquariums, very entertaining especially for small children who can only reach a certain height. Such a delightful experience for the whole family!"

I love all zoos, I've read some reviews here that compare this place to ones in the US (such a sea world), and no it isn't like that, it is unique and just as much fun in its own way! After all it is placed in the middle of a mall in the desert!! I don't understand why people are comparing it to these other places. It is worth every cent you pay, My advice is lgo! Make the most of it, we paid a little extra on entry fee and were granted a ride on a glass bottom boat on the top of the main tank, it was great, got a great look from a different angle."

For Dubai, it is a decent attraction with a separate aquarium tank filled with sharks, other fish and rays and an aquatic zoo. It does not compare to a Sea World or Monterey Aquarium in any way but is a decent way to kill an hour in a mall if you need a break from shopping. However, it is expensive for what it offers and, worst of all, imposes a horrible souvenir shop at the end of the tour. The salespeople are overbearing and push very hard to generate revenueby any means necessary. I would recommend walking straight through it at the end of your tour if you want to avoid being hassled."

The glass bottom boat ride is a bit of a dissapointment, as the glass bottoms are not very clear and you will have difficulty watching the fishes through the glass. Kudos to the engineeting though.

An entrance fee of 110 dirhams allows you entry into the aquarium tunnel walk, the underwater zoo and a ten minute ride on a glass bottom boat. A walk through the aquarium is an experience that leaves you bewildered with the range of colours of fish in glass aquariums, the deep, yellow, orange swimming furiously in the transparent tank enclosures. The underwater zoo has all animal life from the different climatic zones kept under temperature controlled enclosures simulating their living conditions. Watching the penguins in Dubai was completely paradoxical just seeing these North Pole birds surviving in a desert climate. An entire area for reptiles housed in spooky surroundings with large tropical trees and hanging bridges gives the impression of walking through the rain forests. The glass bottom boat ride gives you a glimpse of the marine life floating under your feet coming as close as it can get. Life jackets are provided for safety and the boat operated on a overhead pulley is a break away from the open sea glass bottom adventure. The tunnel walk is just incredible with the fish swimming all around you at a hands distance, sometimes you get to touch the fish underbelly through the glass protective covers, a surreal feeling of wonderment. At the conclusion of the tour you get to pick a free gift valued at 25 dirhams per ticket from the souvenir shop at the exit gate. The huge aquarium is the central point of attraction in the Dubai Mall, also visible to the shoppers viewing from outside the aquarium enclosure."

While the cost of entrance is surely not cheap (I guess this depends on the package you select at the entrance), I can say that the entire experience was worth it. The walk through the glass tunnel which is under the aquarium that houses (they say) 20,000 species of fish is short, but the live corals and variety of fish make the walk through fun. Once through the tunnel, you have to take the elevators up two flights of stairs where you present your receipt again to enter another part of the zoo. This section houses more fish and animals like penguins.My son went crazy as he watched the keepers feed the penguins. It was honesty a good show. We also took a short 15 minute right in a glass bottom boat which gives you some prospective on the size of the tank and number of fish. For though adventure seekers, you can opt to scuba dive with a guide in the tank which is filled with fish and SHARKS! Worth the money and the time. I took my son there TWICE!"

Freaky looking! The three story wall part of the aquarium is open to the mall and almost constantly lined by onlookers from all three levels...that's a nice touch and does invite you to go in and see more. You can even pay to dive in the aquarium though we thought the price for that was a bit too much. It costs about the same as diving in open waters of the gulf and my wife and I rather do that instead of the enclosed tank...but nonetheless it is nice that they offer that option. We almost missed the 'underwater zoo' part as the directions to get to it are not very clear. You have to walk to other levels above and around the aquarium to get to it and the signs are not very clear. If you just pay to see the aquarium, as we first mistakenly thought we had, then the entrance fee is not worth it...but once you find your way to the rest of the attraction, than it all makes sense why they charge what they charge. All in all, it's a great attraction most especially if you have kids along. Don't forget to use the ten Durham credit that you get per ticket in the gift shop...you can buy small items that cost not much more than the ten Durhams if you don't want to spend additional money."

We bought the one that included entry to the Aquarium, underwater zoo and glass-bottomed boat ride. Daughter enjoyed it immensely. Beware of the photographs - absolute rip offs!! Only sore point of the visit. You end up buying the photos and other memorabilia and then regret it immediately thereafter. Good fun though!!"

We got a discount on the entrance fee because we had the entertain vouchers. Oh boy what can I say the aquarium was awesome with hundreds of go she right from sharks to exotic fish. Once inside we was given a time slot for the boat ride to get a birds eye view of the aquarium. While we waited we wondered around the zoo. My son found the animals very fascinating and enjoy this part a lot more. The animals ranged from reptiles snakes, lizards to penguins, etcOnce we arrived for our boat we was told the 9month old can't go due to age which we could understand why. So we took turns me and the wife along with the two year old who got to go twice with each of us. And now this is an experience to be able to see the wildlife swimming under your feet. The tour includes a guide which takes about the aquarium and how they care for the animals. Overall"

The aquarium is in Dubai mall and you can view the large tank from the foyer without paying a penny, The cost of entry which was about \u00a36.50 gets you into the underwater zoo - which does have a few interesting things to see - otters, penguins, some colourful fish etc. The second part is the ticket to walk through the tunnel - this is behind the main tanks you see for free so mainly the same things but the dark side of the tunnel is where all the big sharks hover about - so you can walk along the tunnel and feel like the sharks are right on your head. I love underwater life and photography so did enjoy this experience but for some they may not appreciate it anymore than they would the large free tank in the main mall. I didn't mind as I didn;t think it was that expensive but if you are a family I suppose the cost would soon add up."

It is a must see experience even though you can see the same tunnel from outside for free (you can not get completely close because of the barrier, but good enough view for photos), you need a ticket to only walk through the tunnel. The tunnel is nice and fun having a shark swim overhead but a lot shorter than I had expected. After the tunnel there is a walk beside the Rainforest restaurant. The underwater zoo is on the upper floor (completely out of the tunnel area; you should take the elevator; no signs there). There are many small tanks of display of different varieties of fish and other little sea creatures. Within the underwater zoo area there is an elevated display area for few creepy creatures. There are few little and medium sized snakes ...We took a combo ticket ((Adult 70 AED, Child 3-12 years 55 AED)) which allows entry to the tunnel, underwater zoo only.We didn't try the glass bottom boat ride ( I heard that The ride itself will be over in 5 minutes or so) neither the fish feeding, and behind scene tour.The souvenir photos are pricey though.. so best to bring your own camera! All in all it was a pleasant way to spend an hour or two.."

Dubai Mall is home a large aquarium where thousands of fishes and other aquatic creatures dart about amid the artificial coral housed within a large viewing panel, according to the Guinness book of World Records, the largest acrylic panel in the world.You can see a lot of it from the outside for free but if you want to walk though the tunnel there is a hefty entrance fee. We had discount vouchers collected from our hotel tourist board and we could also buy tickets for Sega World at a discount at the same time which made admission more palatable. Going through the tunnel and seeing the various fishes upfront was fun for the kids but once yopu have walked through you are done, so make sure you take a lot of pictures along the way.After the tunnel it was upstairs for a glass bottom boat ride which was part of our package. Its just a boat ride on top of the big tank. Again if you are lucky you can see the big fises swim by and again the kids liked it.Once that was done we went to the worthwhile Underwater Zoo. These houses aquatic and natural wildlife displays across eco-zones of the Rainforest, Ocean and Rocky shore. Its not limited to fishes, it has penguins, creepy crawlies and reptiles. A popular aspect again kids would dart for is the ability to have green screen pictures taken by the in house photographers.If it was not the fact that we had discount vouchers and got cut price tickets for Sega World I would say its very expensive for what you get for something that will take up about two hours. However the kids did find it fun and its rare to find something in such as grand scale in a shopping mall."

I didn't think it would be a few pesky little water animals like crabs and crocs and penguins. We heard the Atlantis hotel had the biggest underwater zoo so we headed straight there. We couldn't see anything but images of aquariums so we headed to Dubai mall. In all we spent approximately 4 hours looking for this so called underwater zoo. When we finally fund it, we were thoroughly unimpressed. Ok the tanks are big. The sharks aren't amazingly big but there are lots of them. Sting rays are huge. But seriously?! This is an aquarium. Not a zoo. I felt cheated. U have the option to feed the sharks basically you r given a pot of 5 pieces of food and u chuck it into the tank from the top. Not that great. I think out of everything there I liked the fish embryo they display - a real fish egg with a live embryo growing. At different stages that was amazing. Apart from that - been there done that. So not interested. "

Its on par with the Singapore aquarium and under water zoo and tunnel which i have been earlier. A must go on the Dubai attractions while on a holiday. Both kids and there parents would equally enjoy the experience. I took a combo ticket where i could go through the under water tunnel, behind the scenes, shark feeding etc. there are other combo tickets where one could take the glass bottom boat ride and see the sharks swimming under the boat. The species of fishes found are huge including various kinds of sharks, rays, eels, various aquatic fishes,and the list goes on. The best part of the exhibit is undoubtedly the under water tunnel where one walks through the tunnel and you see the sharks swim above your head, Its a wonderful experience of a life time.In the behind the scenes tour they take you through the whole aquarium to show how things work and all detailed aspect of the aquarium like shark feeding etc. You also get to see various fishes in close proximity and some of them which you can touch like the star fish. It was a one of a kind experience."

There was supposed to be some sort of boat ride included but we weren't sure where that was and the attendant couldn't tell us so perhaps that's on the \"coming soon\" list. The aquarium itself was very well set up, with clear paths that allow you to see all the features without getting rushed along by the people coming up behind you. It starts with a walk through a Perspex-lined tunnel, with a close up view of various fish, sharks, rays, corals and so on, leads on to a series of fish tanks and then upstairs to the \"creepy crawly\" exhibits. Would definitely recommend for kids, perhaps a bit of the same old for older visitors but a nice way to pass a couple of hours overall."

I would say the underwater zoo is less than spectacular for the cost. The wall of the aquarium, viewable for free (and up close) from The Dubai Mall atrium is spectacular, so paying the extra to walk through the tunnel to see the same fish (albeit from underneath) makes me question the value for money. Its a shame you can't pay a modest prIce to walk through the tunnel alone rather than have to pay for both the tunnel AND the underwater zoo, as the latter was mediocre. I didn't like seeing the penguins in indoor captivity either. There's no denying the wall of fish is spectacular though but why pay when you can see it at no cost? I fact, the more I think about it, all those fish species closely packed in one, albeit massive, tank are in an environment not replicated in nature and this alone, in retrospect, is perhaps not a venture worth supporting? Depends how you feel about fish in captivity."

There are different tours - the one we chose included a 'boat' trip which was just a short ride in a glass bottom boat around a large tank. You then go through the zoo section which is very small and some of the information plaques were at adult height so not well thought out for children. Tickets work out quite expensive considering the 'tunnel' is only about 100 yards long and clearly visible from the second floor landing of the Mall. The most annoying thing is that at every few yards there's someone trying to take your photo - and they're very expensive."

The only other place I can think of that you could find an inside aquarium as big would be to go to an actual zoo or dedicated aquarium. There are sharks, rays, and smaller fish and (for a price) you can don a wetsuit and dive into the tank! Walking through will take roughly 20 minutes (just walking through) but it is neat to have fish swimming OVER you as well as around you. Then you can immediately shop or eat afterwards at the world's largest mall. Absolutely worth a visit if in UAE."

This place is located in the Dubai Mall has a very large tank with many fish, sharks, rays, etc, which can be seen from the mall passage in front of the aquarium. Buying a ticket is from AED 90 per person (about US$ 26) and up and allows one access to a single glass tunnel that traverses the bottom of the aquarium and to other exhibits. After walking through the tunnel one takes the escalator to the third floor to see the remainder of the collection--fish, penguins, and other water creatures. The penguin exhibit was our favorite, there are many other smaller fish tanks that contain species anyone who has ever visited a similar place has likely seen before, but it is well done. Compared to similar aquaria I have seen in the US (Camden, Baltimore, Oregon Coast) the overall size of the underwater zoo is quite small, and in addition to the penguins could do with another key attraction. We opted for the AED 110 package which includes a ten-minute glass bottom boat ride (pretty forgettable) and some vouchers for the gift shop. Overall worth a visit, but quite expensive. Budget two hours."

This is a great experience for children who enjoyed the experience a lot more.The cheaper options are better as the glass bottom boat experience was very quick and the tour guide spoke very quietly and did not share much information. Rather just answered the few questions that my husband and I asked. This is probably because of how many tours they fit into a day. A different glass bottom boat experience in another country was much more enjoyable with a lot more information shared about the sea life within the aquarium."

Also you don't get vouchers with the 70dhs option, so are not harrassed to buy anything in the shop. The Tunnel was probably the most impressive part for us.

I've done this in 2009 too but this time it was out of this world. Our two diver instructors, Irwin & Sam, did a great job briefing us and taking us down and around the tank. There are only 4 divers and 2 instructors. This time the sharks were really UP CLOSE & PERSONAL. They come close to you and then automatically move away- and the instructors gently guide them away if they still want to be inquisitive. It's one of the most memorable dives and attractions I've ever accomplished. Kudos to the Dubai Mall administration and to Al Boom diving for this experience. However, it is expensive- it me down by Dhs. 1600 (approx. US$450) for the two of us! Al Boom initially (the same morning) gave us a refresher course at their site at Al Wasl Road- there too, the instructor was an excellent guy who very patiently took us through all the theoretical steps and then into the swimming pool for the practical refresher. My son & I felt in very safe hands all the way."

Then you have to walk through the mall and go up two levels with the lift or escalator to the underwater zoo where you see fish, penguins, crocodiles, snakes, lizards and so forth. Our little ones loved it but it was very crowded (it was a weekday but during school holidays) and everything was so narrow to manoeuver a pram. They also had two of these photo stops, which I hate (where they force you to pose for a picture in order to sell it to you for an exorbitant price a bit later on). this is not a must visit. you see the essence from the outside."

The tunnel inside the aquarium is beautiful, but, as pretty as this is, I did not feel it was the main attraction. The underwater zoo is really big and there is a lot of wildlife on show, even a couple of breeds of penguin! There are many opportunities to get your photo taken and buy it for an extortionate amount but just the same opportunity to take the photos yourself. Worth a visit!"

It is truly cool to see this aquarium and the sharks that cohabitate with the other fish life. However, don't waste your money to go into the museum and walk under the thing. You're going to pay upwards of $40US to walk under a foot tunnel and out the other side. Waste of money, you can see the exact same thing by standing outside the tank, which is what MOST people do. The one thing that is kind of cool is you can book a dive with the sharks. I have no information on how to do that, just what I've heard that it's like $200 US. Want to see wildlife like this with a better experience? Stay at the Atlantis Palm Jumeirah."

Aquariums aren't really my thing, as animals aren't really either, but my friends were quite keen on going to the aquarium while we were in the Dubai Mall (I would have rather spent the time shopping or having lunch), and I personally wasn't incredibly impressed, but I wasn't too discouraged, either. The aquarium part of the attraction on the mall's ground floor, next to the Rainforest Cafe, should take about a maximum of five minutes to get through; it's just a huge, four-sided tank containing an abundance of sharks, fish, seaweed, coral, and sting rays, with a tunnel through the middle of it, offering a more intimate view of the different sea creatures, which was quite nice. The aquarium staff take a picture of you at one stage, in front of a green screen, which you can purchase in leather binding for a ridiculous AED 200! We would have bought our picture, as it had come out quite favourably, but at that price we could have rather purchased dresses for the five of us instead! Afterwards, an inconvenient two levels up, you can go to the 'underwater zoo' portion of the attraction, which was a bit disappointing. It consists of hundreds of small tanks with different fish species, cooped up in the small, kitsch tanks, as well as an upstairs 'creepy crawlies' part, which was basically a bunch of snakes and spiders in tiny glass cages. At the end of the underwater zoo, there is a gift shop that leads out into the mall's food court, in which you can't really buy anything for less than AED 50. So, in other words, all of the merchandise was incredibly overpriced. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone without kids, as the children may still find some fun in spending an hour at most here.*By the way, there are three initial entrance packages for the Aquarium and Underwater Zoo that you can choose from. The first package, at a cost of AED 80 per person, offers nothing more than admission into both attractions. The second package, for AED 90 each, offers both admission to both the attractions, as well as the ability to feed some of the aquarium's fish at certain times every day.The third and final package, at a whopping AED 120 per person, offers only admission to both attraction, and a boat ride amid the fish and the opportunity to stand on top of some of the fish's suspended tanks."

There are many many species of colourful fish and also various other sea animals to see and it's simply amazing. It can be combined with Burj Khalifa - At the top view, as they are all located in the same place. After you are through with the aquarium and the underwater zoo, you can enjoy the musical fountain of 5 mins duration in the evening, starting from 6pm, every half-an hour."

The staff were cleaning the areas with diving suits on and our 3 year old was fascinated watching them. It's her second visit with Mrs D so we opted to feed the fish as well this time and went on the behind the scenes tour of the sick animal area etc. Upstairs in the underwater zoo the jungle walk ways were great fun and of course the penguins and giant crabs were firm favourites."

I find it confusing that they're not internally connected and we have to use the mall's escalator to go up to the zoo and then used the same escalator to come down to the aquarium again. You definitely should walk through the aquarium's tunnel. It gave me a feeling like diving into the sea and able to see fishes all over without carrying the tank and breathing through tubes. If this is your first time visiting a huge aquarium, I think it's definitely interesting to see many fish species and amazing to see huge stingray and sharks. Although, I've been to a huge aquarium in Lisbon, Portugal already and I find this Underwater Zoo small."

We took the platinum package which included glass bottom boat ride, which turned out to be a damp squib, they just move the boat at the top of the aquarium and explain some mechanics involved in maintaining the aquarium, while you see fishes swimming below your feet in a semi transparent bottom of the boat. I would strongly suggest that you can just buy the basic package. One thing i noticed, that the glass walls act as a magnifier, so you see this massive fish, but actually it isnt that massive...it s the glass that magnifies the fish...i dont know if thats intentional or the fibre glass has a magnifying property. The sheer audacity to think of housing an aquarium of this scale needs to be lauded. The variety of fishes is good. The zoo part is just about ok. Now, they catch you at different points, take a snap and then pounce on you later with your printed photo in a frame, at a different spot and ask ridiculously high price for it...they have a class act in the aquarium, they should keep the standards in every aspect of the experience."

The ticket comes with a 10% discount to spend in the gift shop.Tip 2: Since you are paying so much to get into the aquarium, i would suggest you to take as many photos as possible with stingray. There is one thing that you can do in the underwater aqarium is to be upclose and personal with the stingrays and sharks. They are not that visible when you view the tank from outside.Tip 3: You ticket also allow you to go into the creepy crawley sections where you can see crocodile, aligator, lizards, beetles and etc. I didn't find them amusing but if you are travelling with your family, it is worth bringing your kids there. Definitely very educational!Tip 4: Yes, camera are allowed in this premise.Tip 5: I personally will not visit here again because once is mroe than enough to see everything.

I got the full package for around 110 AED which included the zoo and the glass bottomed boat ride, as well as a 20 AED credit at the gift shop. The aquarium was nice--it's a tunnel that you walk through. I wish the tunnel had been longer--it seemed that I had walked through it in no time. There are HUGE rays and about 70 sharks. The aquarium boats the record for the world's largest single pane of acrylic glass. To ride the glass bottomed boat, you need to go up to the next level, and then to the next level again for the underwater zoo. The animals there are not ultra-exotic, but then again, we have pet tarantulas, snakes and lizards at our house, so I'm not awed by seeing more of them--they are common place for me/my family. Still, though, it's a great opportunity for people to see all sorts of animals, mainly aquatic, and it's a great activity for kids."

On the ground floor ther eis a big tank with sharks, rays and other bigger fish. On the third floor are more aquariums with different kind of fish nd some other animals like otters and penguins. Don't try to compare this aquarium with others. The location makes it unique and after a day shopping it is nice to visit something else."

We wanted to spend some minimum time here and wanted to spend more time for shopping but in the end we spent almost 3 hrs here. To top it , Visa was running a scheme wherein we got 1 free ticket with every ticked purchased but some discounts on the ticket price which was great, possibly due to DSF.The aquarium was fabulous and so was the underwater zoo. The sharks and the sting rays were worth all the money spent. They were great. I had a nice time shooting all photos while passing through the shark tunnel. Avoid purchasing the photos from them as they are a costly affair."

It was our day out after marriage it was a perfect day for us. For children or adults - regardless of the age - its a perfect place to enjoy and forget yourselves. You love each and every species there. Starting from the smallest fishes to the giant sharks and wavy eels, sea horse, everything you can enjoy here. Even you wish for underwater diving - here is your chance. You should pay some amount for that. Anyway its gonna be one of the precious moment in your life. You can go through different categories of aqua species and it will dd your knowledge. What I liked the most is the Penguins over there. When I moved around by touching my hands on the glass Penguins started coming in my directions following me. I played with them for sometime and even taken video and kept with me. I feel like very childish and my wife could stop laughing by seeing the child in me. Even the dancing crabs and silent sea horse you will be more curious like a kid. Roam around and enjoy! You will never feel to come back out of it. Its a perfect place to day out! Its located in Dubai Mall and you can spend a full day in the Mall - as there are lot more to enjoy there!"

The Underwater Tunnel is not that impressive considering you can practically see the same thing for free by standing at the huge aquarium wall in the mall. The best part of the experience was the ''zoo'' part on Level 2, as there were tons of interesting tanks and exhibits with a wide variety of land and sea creatures. The worst part is we paid extra money for the glass bottom boat ride. This was a total disaster. Five minutes - that's right - five minutes in a small glass bottom boat seeing the same thing you could see in any if the tanks. What a waste of money!Overall, if you have two hours to kill and are with young children, the Dubai Aquarium might be somewhat enjoyable. Just don't get the expensive packages. They are a waste of money. Get the cheapest one and hope your little ones enjoy the experience."

Was surprised to get one ticket free as a special promotion for visa platinum card holders. So ended up paying (55 AED) for 1 ticket only.The tunnel left us in awe as we felt as if we were inside the water and surrounded by sharks, eels and mantas. My daughter did not feel like leaving the tunnel !She learnt a lot about different species and types of underwater world/animals in the underwater zoo section and also in the creepy-crawlies section.Another highlight was the penguin shelters which were amazing for the kids. It took us about 2 hours to complete the tour and we had a very satisfactory experience.This attraction is much better and has more variety than the lost world aquarium at atlantis palm.

Well I am short of words to describe the experience . The owner claims and I quote \u201cThe Dubai Aquarium is home to more than 33,000 living animals, including 400 sharks and rays and a close encounter via its acrylic walk through tunnel. The Underwater Zoo brings you face-to-face with piranha, giant catfish, otters and a penguin colony while walking through the Rainforest, Rocky Shore and Living environments\u201d The claim seems to be justified .The collection ,display and keeping different types of fishes and other animals in a huge \u2013huge aquarium which live in water are so large in \u201cnumber\u201d and \u201ctype of species\u201d that visitor feel lost and only keep on staring with admiration . It is housed in three storied lay out with other attractions .Some of fishes with living man sitting amongst these big big fishes etc are visible even without going inside .Some feel it is better to see it from out side but I feel one should visit inside to feel the real environment .It is in side the tunnel experience brings you \u201cface-to-face with piranha, giant catfish, otters and a penguin colony while walking through the Rainforest, Rocky Shore and Living environments from all side\u201d .In side the tunnels it appears that you are in the deep sea surrounded by these water animals which are attacking you from all side. Penguin is added attraction Only when one visit it one can believe that such a collection exists . In Dubai this should be first attraction to be visited"

Visited with family on 25 Dec.The aquarium is located in three levels. 1st level - is massive fish tank, which is best viewed from out-side it self, though it has a short tunnel for closer look. It has sharks and other big fish. Options for scuba diving with sharks and glass-bottom boat ride is available in this tank. 2nd level- has smaller aquariums with variety of marine life, otters, crocodiles etc. One must not miss the feeding of Penguins. Check the feeding time displayed at the entrance or on the web-site. The show is of 30 min, free, its very amusing and interesting to see how penguins follow the gestures of their handler in queuing up for fish feed. My two children were delighted with show.3rd Level has insects, spiders, chameleons etc. With a small rope way bridge midst a small man-made artificial tropical foliage.The whole place does not have either travelators, escalators or any other resting place inside. Especially so, as its located in Dubai Mall, its a tiring experience as we had visited this place soon after visiting Burj Khalifa. Some chairs inside the aquarium would have been great."

However having said this there was one thing Ii missed out on here which was a boat ride. Now I am not too sure of the details of this to comment but might make it a worthwhile visit so do check on that."

I first saw it at night - when the lights make it a little more magical. There is quite a lot to see just from the outside - for free, and although you can not get completely upclose because of the barrier, its certainly a good enough view for photos, its also a good way to see the aquarium in its entirity. Having walked past it a few times I spontaneously decided to go in one Saturday afternoon. There are variouos packages - I went for the 90AED one which lets you into the aquarium tunnel and zoo as well as gives you a gift voucher for the shop (which I did not use) .There are however others which let you dive with the sharks, or take a boat ride over the top of the aquarium.The entrance to the aquarium takes you past the big window - which can be seen for free, although most people do not stop to take advantage of their close view as 1) you believe there is going to be something more inside, and 2) there are so many people looking at the window from behind the barrier that you almost feel part of the exhibit.However, my recommendation is to make the most of this time as for me, this panaromic view was the most spectacular part of the whole place.The tunnel part is fun- having a shark swim overhead or one of the flat fish pulll a smiley face while suckered to the transparent tunnel roof is enjoyable. The tunnel is however fairly short - alot shorter than I had anitcipated. After the tunnel there is a walk via the rainforest restaurant and then you get to view some more high walled parts of the aqaurium.After this, the aquarium visit is over - I had imagined it to be alot bigger but its not. I nearly missed the second part of the visit as there are no real signs or instuctions to tell you that the underwater zoo part is up 2 floors - I only found out as I wandered into the restaurant next door flashing my voucher thinking it was the gift shop and one of the waitresses ushered me in the rigt direction.So, two floors up (and out of the aquarium) you then go into the underwater zoo - you can first go and feed the fish. I think there was also supposed to be a behind the scenes type of tour but there was a lack of proactive personnel so either it did not take place or I missed it.The zoo part is great - there are various tanks with everthing from goldfish to squid, penguins and otters as well as crocodiles and turtles. All tanks are well kept and it looks as though all the creatures have enough room to live in. The otters are fun to watch for a while, as are the penguins. There are plenty of information signs around the tanks so you read up on the characteristics of each animal.The aqaurium is really designed around families and there were many very happy and excited children really enjoying their time there,All in all it was a pleasant way to spend an hour , however having seen the aquarium from the outside many times , I had anticipated that the inside of it would be just as spectacular - but it did not meet my expectations."

The staff were friendly and you get to jump in the tank along with hundreds of fish (some of them in the tank with you!) don't worry though as the sharks cannot get in.If you have a PADI you can scuba with the sharks but please note you will not be allowed up the Burj Khalifa for 48 hours if you do this!!!The website said no cameras but when we got there they said if we had underwater cameras then we were free to use them so take them and chance it.Overall a good 40 minutes experience.The underwater Zoo is very small and will not take you long to walk around."

The tunnel goes under the aquarium and you can see reef sharks, large schools of fish and even a whale shark. The tank is themed to a shipwreck with several man-made barnacle ridden structures seen around the tank, giving it a rather weathered look.At the exit of the tunnel there is a rainforest caf\u00e9. It looked cool but we didn\u2019t go inside. From there we went to second part of the zoo which is in the third floor.As soon as we enter the underwater zoo, it follows a rather linear route winding through the exhibits and passing through many tanks of fishes before moving onto the next. There are many kinds of fishes like piranhas and even playful otters. There were also some fishes native to the Amazon as well as south East Asia. There was a shark tank comprising of small reef sharks, jellyfishes which glow under synthetic florescent lighting as well as a few relatively exotic crustaceans such as Alaskan crabs. The deep sea areas of the zoo are nicely themed with waterfalls and fiberglass cave walls, giving it a subterranean atmosphere.Following the route, we eventually came to the bug section called creepy crawly where we could see scorpions and tarantulas and in the reptile section of the zoo where there were display of some lizards and snakes. There was also a mini suspension bridge made of rope up there which forms the rainforest \u201ccanopy walk\u201d part of the park, allowing you to have an overview of the rainforest portions of the park. One of the best parts of the zoo was watching the penguins exhibit."

Like most visitors we were drawn into walking the aquarium tunnels from the mall-side view of the large tank. The tunnels didn't disappoint, the fish were stunning and you felt extremely close to them in the tunnels, where watching the under-belly of a shark feels quite eerie. Included in our ticket was a trip to the underground zoo, so we went to take a look.First impressions were good. It was July, low season for Dubai, so the place wasn't busy and we got a good look at everything. The spiders and snakes were interesting, as were the turtles and lizards. Though all these niceties are sort of irrelevant as I still can't get over the sadness I felt at seeing the two different penguin enclosures. They were no bigger than a small room, with air conditioning blasting, white painted rocks and perspex looking out onto the zoo floor. The smell was awful, but perhaps this is normal for any indoor enclosure. Each enclosure had a small pool for swimming, but no sooner had a penguin dived in, there was little room for swimming as they'd have to slow to a stop or jump out again. It was awful to think these penguins would not see any natural light. Some signs mentioned that one breed had been bred in captivity, but I don't think this is ever an excuse to keep these intelligent animals, who swim hundreds of miles in the wild, enclosed in the cramped area. They were showing signs of utter bordom, two were pacing the floor, turning, and heading back to where they'd started; over and over. There were some rattles and other 'stimulating' objects hung on a wall but they weren't being used.Dubai bragged about having the first penguins in the UAE and the worlds first underground zoo - but there's a good reason these things have never been done - they are cruel, unecessary money-spinners."

Prices are a little bit expensive for families (between AED 110 - 80, depending on the package)Overall, I prefer to watch from outside rather going inside the tunnel and undrwater zoo."

The variety of fishes simply amazes. The tunnel passing under the aquarium is a wonderful experience. A very well maintained place and quite a learning experience for the kids is the underwater zoo. The little one was so excited that he could not stop screaming each time he saw a new creature. A must see. The only dampener is the high cost of entry, which is reduced can increase the number of people who can partake the experience from much closer quarters. "

It was fun watching them swim around you.. above you! Great experience here.The zoo was not that exciting, though educational. Kids would probably enjoy it more. The place felt stuffy and smelled rather musty. Felt a bit suffocating, or maybe it's because of the snakes and spiders and creepy crawlies that I'm just not into.Be careful of your belongings when roaming inside the zoo. Dropped my wallet, without knowing, when I crawled under one of the aquariums for a photo opp (my bad really!). So, a special shout out to that kid who returned my wallet. God bless that kid."

Walking through the tunnel is a splendid experience. The glass-bottomed boat ride gives much perspective to those who ride it. And one could spend hours in the underwater zoo, which is a real treat.It's also good value for money. TIP: I'd highly recommend getting the all-inclusive tickets for the tunnel, boat ride, and zoo, which give you the total aquarium experience at the pace of your choosing.My only complaint is minor enough to not take away from the stars I'd rate this place with -- the gift shop of the aquarium is pretty sorry. It has tons of items, but it feels like it has nothing at all. All very banal and unfortunately, like the several times they stand you to take pictures, where the commercialization bit stands out so glaringly. Still, the sea creatures and the displays speak for themselves. This is a no-brainer. Consider it a must-see if you're in Dubai, and especially if you have kids. Also, I'd devote an entire day to this. Our only regret was we couldn't spend more than two hours combined here. Next time, I'm diving in the tank!"

We felt that this was overpriced, primarily because we thought we would get to see more of the massive aquarium once inside, but as it turns out most of the fishes can be seen from OUTSIDE, and you pay to walk underneath the tunnel which doesn't actually give you a very good view. The underwater zoo is informative and it was really funny because we saw the same guy feed about three different animals, but the glass bottom boat ride is short and definitely not worth the extra money. However, the aquarium IS beautiful, and the behind-the-scenes tour is quite informative though very very short. Try and go for the cage diving option as it looked really fun!"

The snorkel was excellent we were in the cage for 30mins with sharks and rays swimming past and fish in the cage, big salmon. Very exciting watching all the fish and stuff they get up to. Great value for money 220 each I think. Staff were very nice. If you want to know about the aquarium, fishes etc you still need to do the regular aquarium tour as we weren't told anything and would have liked to have known more. A real wow factor and experience we won't forget soon. It can get pretty cold after 30mins so it would have been nice if showers were hotter and hair dryer before you go back into the glam mall.

Our initial impression was very good, and we enjoyed all the visual interests such as the Atrium and Underwater Zoo and Aquarium. Although the aquarium could have been more entailed (only really a long glass tunnel which goes through the middle of the aquarium), the abundance of wildlife made up for it for sure! We saw so many sharks and species of beautiful species of fish! Additionally, there is an Ice Skating Rink for people of all ages to skate which looked like a lot of fun! The Mall has every type of store for those interested in shopping although prices are steep all over the middle east. If you are looking for a bargain this is not the place for you! Overall, this is a great place to visit for people of all ages and interests. There is definitely something for everyone!"

The aquarium is clearly visible from 2 floors of the Dubai mall so you can see the sharks and rays without paying. The underwater walk is the same as in any Sea Life Centre, though apparently the aquarium tank is the largest in the world.The price list does not show the cheapest option, Dhs 50, that lacks only the behind-the-scenes tour compared to the Dhs 75 one.

You can actually dive in this aquarium with Al Boom diving. It costs about \u00a3120 which is a lot for one 40mins dive. I justified it by thinking of it as an experience like no other. You get all your equipment and a long briefing that scares you you a bit about what happens if the shark fancies your regulator. Don't exhale when a shark is overhead as it freaks them out! This is hard stuff to think about when floating with 16 Sharks in a glass bowl.Overall the experience was great, well organised. You do need to be a decent diver as there is not a lot of space and there are a lot of large fish, sharks, rays etc... You have to be able to control buoyancy as this is critical. It is crazy having loads of people looking at you as you float down into the aquarium which is around 12m deep.Well worth the money!"

The \"glass\" bottom boat ride was a joke. The glass bottom was so scratched you couldn't see anything.

Given the rather hefty admissions fee, it is ironic that most of what there is to see at the Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo doesn\u2019t cost anything. The massive viewing panel (according to their website, the \u201cworld\u2019s largest acrylic panel\u201d) is in the public area of the Dubai Mall, offering shoppers and unimpeded view of the main tank.By paying the admissions fee, you also get to walk through the 48-metre long aquarium tunnel eleven metres under the surface \u2013 which even in slow-motion takes less than five minutes. Then it is upstairs to the so-called \u201cunderwater zoo\u201d, which, frankly, is a poor excuse for an interpretive centre and is plainly designed as a conduit to the aquarium shop.So rather save your money for some of the mall\u2019s famous sales (GAP, which is next door to the aquarium, had a 60% off sale when we visited Dubai)."

Huge fish, circling with small ones, large sting rays, floating about, looking at you with huge eyes. The best is when the divers feed them... there will be a frenzy and rush of various colonies trying to get their fill. It spans two large stories, so one can see from the second floor as well and there is a tunnel (for pay) one can go through to be circled by the aquarium. Great fun for all... don't miss it.

However, that's only one side of aquarium wall and you cant really take good close up shots due to reflections of the glass and the queue which forms right in front of it.We had reserved half a day for Dubai Mall and believe me it ran out very fast. The tunnel, though a bit small was a unrushed experience. Saw some feeding and divers who stop around for pictures. Lots of lazy sharks just lying around stationary. If you are a shark fan, there is good variety to be spotted.The underwater zoo is also worth a walk, saw some foot-long crabs, baby crocs and penguins providing value to the tour."

The sharks normally hide in the dark quiet places, so a walk through the tunnel is a must if you want to see the sharks. If you time your visit well, you can get to see the divers feeding the fish which is quite a treat to watch."

You pay extra to go through the tunnel of the aquarium, but you don't really get to see any more than you do from standing out in the mall and seeing the main walls of the aquarium for no cost! The tunnel actually distorts everything, as well, making it not as good as watching from the outside!The Zoo is upstairs from the aquarium and there are a variety of reptiles, fish, penguins and otters. One of the beavers looked like it was almost dead, just floating on the surface of the water, which was a bit sad. The fish tanks were cool, lots to see. Both ice peguins and the water ones. As always a bit sad seeing the animals in captivity but everything seemed really clean and the aminals seemed healthy for the most part which was good."

I have been in many of them around the world ( Vancouver aquatium, Sea world in Florida and California ) an this is just a huge fish tank. I really don't know how they can call it an aquarium. I can't deny that for a mall it is big, but it isn't a aquarium. Price is high and the walk through the tank is not a big deal. There is no good information for what they display, but I can say that the Alaska crab display is good, penguins stink and for the reptile display, pet shops have a better selection. Save your money and just look outside. If you have childrens it is ok, they don't look for extended information but only fun."

With my second holiday in Dubai for 7 days & travelling solo I decided to visit the Aquarium on the 7th Feb/12, considering I didn't have the time during my 1st visit in 2010 I was more determined to make the time. The admission fee [one adult] is only AED 100.00 [approx $27.00 Australian Dollars] & extremely good value. Like may tourist attractions it all depends on your budget & time-frame, for instance if you take your time & read all the information provided in the aquarium you could spend between 2-3 hrs at your leisure. After viewing inside the aquarium your admission ticket will allow you a small free, or discounted gift, the staff at the aquarium will direct you to the gift shop with only a couple of min's to walk. Take advantage of the Dubai Metro system & again very cheap way of traveling around the city for only AED 16.00 for the entire day...... happy snaps! & enjoy the experience!"

            "review": "Very average aquarium, a lot of hype. We went to Dubai aquarium with my two kids 9 and 7. We were blown away with the largest ever acrylic panel that the public can see from the mall side. In fact, it was such a let down after we bought the tickets. We bought the diamond package, check their website for features. Here's how it went:- after purchase of tickets (85 AED each) follow the cordon around the huge tank. You are approx 2 metres closer than the rest of the public watching. No advantage there.- Then you go into a very SHORT tunnel. Make the most of this tunnel, it is by far the best feature of the entire journey. These tunnels do exist in other far east countries, so if you've seen one before, it's pretty much the same. Still, it is amazing watching the sharks, rays and other fish float over you. - Once out of the tunnel, you have to travel 2 floors up using the escalator to enter the aquarium.- The aquarium is well stocked but the tanks look far too small to house the number of fish and animals. Most of the tanks contain small fish with the exception of the catfish. This bit takes around 30 minutes if you read as you go along.- Upstairs is a creepy crawly place, fairly sparse but interesting for lizard lovers, they have a few interesting species.That's it!- We then fed the fish, a bit of a rip off as you simply throw in a few bits of fish food into the tank far below. Some fish can be bothered to eat. This is followed by a 10 minute tour of the behind the scenes. This was quite interesting as we have never seen how an aquarium works, the guide was informative and friendly. Kids enjoyed this, though little kids wouldn't understand.After this short trip (we had planned 2/3 hours for this!) we decided we may as well go for the glass bottom boat ride. We paid 25 AED EXTRA each for this. There is perfect review of this by another senior contributor 'fipty801'. This review is spot on!- Get into boat with broken life jacket- Float along the top of the tank, try and see through the very scratched glass- Guide provides NO INFORMATION at all- The lights above make it hard to see through the glass and yes you have to avoid looking at each others feet. A HUGE disappointment, don't do it!!! (Unless you have money to burn and time to spend)This attraction is for young kids (except the tour) and for people who have not been to many aquariums. It's expensive and overhyped."

There's even a \"creepy crawly\" exhibit with spiders and other \"nasties\" as well.The \"glass bottom boat ride\" went something like this:- Get harassed by hawkers wanting to take your photo (seems to be the latest craze in Dubai) for viewing and purchase later.- Get given a (broken) life jacket to wear.- Sit in glass bottom boat and tour guide begins to explain about the aquarium: \"Its 11 000 000 litres of sea water.....\", and that's ALL the info you get.- stare down through everybody elses' feet for 10 minutes.- disembark the glass bottom boat and get channeled into the gift shop on your way out.Really, your kids, aged 13 and under will love the tunnel, and underwater zoo.

I've had to ask for it and the girl told me that the cheapest package was the platinium one. I ask for the manager and then, they gave me the cheapest one wich is the visti of the aquarium and the zoo.

This section now has overhead walkways. It is quite small and needs to be taken slowly. You exit into the souvenir shop. No surprises there. On the way in a photo can be taken and purchased later. This is not cheap. Al Boom Diving will arrange dives in the aquarium. Qualified divers pay less and they will offer some training for those who need it. Diving in the aquarium is very expensive(more than $250) so it is only for those with deep pockets and those who wish to be seen by the world passing by. I suspect the latter might out some people off. There is also cage diving so you can descend to those sharks."

What makes the Dubai Aquarium such a wonder is not that its a giant fish tank with a glass panel 51 meters long, containing 10 million litres of water... its the fact that its contained within a mall and visible over 3 levels of the mall! Visitors to the Dubai Mall are free to watch the amazing display of underwater creatures from the front of the aquarium, but there's a whole host of other aquarium experiences that you can purchase tickets for including fish feeding, a glass bottomed boat ride and even diving with the sharks. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the Dubai Aquarium is running a promotion with Visa, and holders of Platinum Visa cards are entitled to a 50% discount on entrance tickets. This meant that we only ended up paying a total of 50 dhirams (about USD15) for 2 people, and this gave us entry to the short but spectacular underwater tunnel through the aquarium and then on to the mini zoo on the upper floors. The underwater tunnel is highly recommended as this is where their fabulous sharks and rays are best viewed from. A completely magical and colourful adventure in the heart of the world's largest mall"

The pure size of the mylar holding back the water is impressive even before you consider the fish, rays, and sharks swimming just behind it. Although you can see most of the aquarium from outside, the walk through the tunnel was equally impressive and allowed for some up close time with some very large sea creatures! The glass-bottom boat ride was not nearly as impressive as the rest of the aquarium and I would recommend skipping it. All in all, the Aquarium was well worth the time spent there!"

The aquarium is amazing though; it is a tunnel inside the fish tank so you can see sharks and all types of fish swimming next to you which was really fun. I have been to aquariums before; that's why i was not fascinated with the zoo. So i would totally recommend you go to the aquarium especially that its ticket is half the price of the ticket for the zoo; the zoo ticket is inclusive of the zoo and the aquarium, but you can buy only the aquarium./"

The zoo could easily take an hour to view and finally you have a short glass bottom boat ride on top of the aquarium which lasts about 10 minutes.

A must for anyone interested in marine life - snorkelling vouchers are available from the Dubai entertainer but timeslots must be booked in advance. Our snorkelling guide, Randy, was absolutely brilliant. Although slightly cheaper, the snorkelling experience in Aquaventure at the Atlantis is shorter, generally features smaller fish but you can swim more freely around the tank.The Underwater Zoo's collection of animals is outstanding, with some really rare and fascinating creatures. Better signs would be appreciated, but it's a wonderful collection."

There was a member of staff in the tunnel talking to visitors. We thought she was going to tell us about the sealife but instead she focused on the divers who were in the tank and their equipment which was not really of interest. The glass bottom boat was not worth the effort - we had to queue and put on life jackets but it was a real waste of time as all we did was look at the same sealife from the top of the tank. It is starting to look uncared for in this area with the fake rocks coming apart & rusting in places and looking quite tacky. I just hope they spend enough time looking after the fish."

You don\u2019t need a ticket to see this. Though you can also see the tunnel from outside without a ticket, you need one to walk through it. The tunnel is nice but not something that makes you \u2018wow\u2019. Underwater zooThe underwater zoo is on the upper floor. There are few small tanks of display of different varieties of fish and other little sea creatures. Again this is nothing compared to some of the popular aquariums around the world. Within the underwater zoo area there is an elevated display area for few creepy creatures. There are few little and medium sized snakes on display here. Nothing spectacular to talk about. Glass bottom boat rideThis is also on the same floor as the underwater zoo. If you have ticket for this then go to the desk for the boat ride and get a time for your ride. Once you made the booking for the ride timeslot you can then walk around the underwater zoo area and get back to the boat ride nearer to the allocated time. The boat sails on top of this mega tank of water and through the thick glass panel at the bottom of the boat one can get a clear view of the fish and the settings below. If you have bought the tickets for the fish feeding then you must have been give the feed that you now throw onto the water to attract few medium sized fish. There were few good sized sharks and fish around but nothing big to make you really excited. The ride itself will be over in 5 minutes or so. I think the diving and the shark cage experience also done on this floor. Though didn\u2019t experiment but I saw the diving gears and other accessories while taken to the boat ride area.TicketsYou can either buy an all inclusive kind of ticket which allows entry to the tunnel, underwater zoo, fish feeding, glass bottom boat ride, behind scene tour or something like that. Or you can choose to buy (or upgrade) tickets separately for the underwater zoo and glass bottom boat ride. The ticket price is bit high for what is on display here.The Entertainer Dubai voucher allows to get 1 free entry for the tunnel and underwater zoo for a paid ticket for the same. You need to buy the glass bottom boat ride and other options separately. As of December 2011 it was AED 25 per person for the glass bottom boat ride. If you are a first timer to an aquarium then you may find this place interesting. Also, if you would like to take this as part of the Dubai holiday experience then you can spend some time here and have fun. For others, except the gigantic tank, I guess there is nothing much as an aquarium as such."

The aquarium employees have so much enthusiasm and are delighted to impart their knowledge and information to all visitors ... very educational and brilliantly displayed.To date, I have never seen a better (or larger) or more impressive aquarium anywhere in the world. For visitors to Dubai with limited time, without actually having to enter the aquarium, one can see the grandeur of the exterior of the main part of the aquarium from the interior of the Dubai Mall from various levels ... the viewing windows are no less than two storeys high, and provide a wonderful insight into various forms of marine life and, if luck is on your side, you may even witness the aquarium keepers descend in cages to feed the sharks."

It is the holder of the Guinness World Record for the 'World's Largest Acrylic Panel', which means it is larger than Japan's Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium. The 10 million litre aquarium tank is the largest suspended aquarium in the world and has various species like the giant spider crabs, sea jelly, sea horse, clown fish(nemo), the giant puffer fish, the humboldt penguin (they were the cutest) and a lot more creep crawly creatures. I went for the platinum package(AED 75) which included:1. aquarium tunnel & underwater zoo2. behind the scenes tour3. gift shop voucher worth AED 10The Ultimate Aquarium package includes the glass-bottom boat ride and fish feeding in addition to the ones mentioned above.Once you get to the Rainforest level, do get some photos clicked with a live python."

As diving is one of my favourite sports, I have found diving inside an Aquarium with live black tip sharks and having the opportunity to feed them an even better affair. The wall itself is known as one of the largest Acrylic walls in the world, but the main attraction for myself was (again) the diving. While inside the tank, one can see various rays and mantas, while also seeing a few groupers, tame nursing sharks, one or two flathead hammerheads, and a few larger black-tips.The Zoo itself is mostly aquatic lifeforms, and some of the more rare options could also be found. The tanks however, I felt were on the little of the small side, as they also have penguins, I felt that the space for these little animals to play in was not very adequate. Nonetheless, the option to have had three dives, and complete a PADI Speciality Dive for the experience was well worth it. The dive operator was actually Al Boom Diving, and the dive instructor Ryan was extremely helpful, even with my poor scheduling with him. Overall Experience: A"

It was a small boat which floated around the top of the tank, and we did not think it worth the experience. Upstairs were a variety of fish in the 'zoo' section.

You would need to allow at least an hour to do both attractions justice. We felt that this represented excellent value, regardless of how the rest of my review is perceived!The Aquarium is pretty much plain to see. For the most part, you wouldn't necessarily have to pay the entrance to see most of the fish as it's slap bang in the middle of the main atrium in the Dubai Mall! But, the entrance ticket enables you to walk through the underwater tunnel running the length of the giant tank. It's very cool walking through the sharks and it's lovely seeing the rays gliding around - we saw a particularly cute one playing a game sliding down the curve of the tunnel :o)You do have to poke up with the omnipresent naffness of posing for a staged photo which you can buy out through the other end of the tunnel, but the staff don't hound you into buying.For the Underwater Zoo, you then go up the escalator to level 2 (be warned all you broody potential parents, it's up in the incredibly cute baby section of the Dubai Mall)In here were all the usual suspects you might find in a fishy exhibit - clown fish, pyrrhanas, angel fish, angler fish etc etc There were also other creepies like tarantulas, snakees, lizards as well as the fluffier otters and water rats.My favourites were the very cute penguins which I could have watched frolicking for hours.An ideal way to spend family time in the air-conditioned coolness, but also great for anyone else in touch with their inner child!"

They have a few options of how you would like to see the Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, either on your own; with a guided tour or there is also an option of going on a tour, glass bottom boat and fish feeding! They also give you vouchers and extra things with these options. We chose just to walk through on our own, but all options were very reasonable rates.The underwater zoo had great ocean and rainforest backdrops for each display of marine life or 'creepy crawlies'. There were lots of different fish, turtles, otters and crustaceans and the rainforest section included a suspension bridge which overlooked the marine life below it. I thought the best part in the zoo were the penguins, there were two different breeds and they were so adorable.The aquarium is known for having the largest viewing panel, and you can walk along the outside of it and then go INSIDE it through a see through tunnel where you are surrounded by fish, sharks, stingrays and divers!!Definitely a must see in Dubai and suitable for all ages!"

After visiting many aquariums in the past I wasn't expecting too much different from the Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo at the Dubai Mall, but I was very wrong! For less than half the price of an entry to a Sea life centre in the UK you get to walk through one of the largest underwater glass tunnels in the world through the world largest aquarium tank! The spectacle of the giant glass window looking into the aquarium from the Mall is where most people stand but I highly recommend paying the small entry fee, it's well worth it! It's a great experience and there is plenty of sharks and fish to see. This was fantastic as it was but it's only half the story!The underwater zoo was up one level and was an amazing walk through experience that took about one hour to visit. It included many more fish and animals including Perinea's, Penguins, Stingrays, Otters, Lizards, Snakes, Starfish, Jellyfish and much much more. It was great fun too with rope bridges to adventure across and a glass floor you can walk over above the giant tank. It's a fantastic venue and offer something for all ages. It's also many times better than any Sea life centre I have ever visited with my Merlin Annual Pass in the UK! Don't miss out on this well looked after and organised attraction in Dubai!"

Can't complain because this was at the mall..The tickets were pretty pricey for the amount of fish and the wildlife being offered. The tour from top was pretty lame. Just take the underground tunnel and mark this thing off your things to do list..."

You can see into the tank for free from the Mall and it really is HUGE! But when you pay and go in you get to experience the fish up close! The fish and animals all seem to be well looked after and in good health so I hope they are all well looked after! The tunnel is short but we were asking staff all about the fish/sharks what they were called and there was a member of staff who was happy to chat and share his knowledge with us."

            "review": "Aquarium's tunnel was short. more impressive from the outside (free). underwater zoo was better. I was a bit disappointed since the aquarium's tunnel was quite short. If you've never seen/been to an underwater tunnel before, I suppose maybe it's worth the 25 dirhams, but to be honest, I thought it was more impressive looking at the tank from the outside (mall) which was free. It was packed with loud tourists when I was there so it was not a tranquilizing experience. The underwater zoo upstairs was better, but also packed with loud tourists tapping on the glass and taking flash photography (not allowed but there was no stopping such annoying behavior). Being in that environment was giving me a headache (opposite of what an aquarium should do), but the underwater zoo itself is not too bad (another 25 aed to get in). I personally enjoyed the Lost Chambers at Atlantis the Palm better even though it was twice as expensive to get in (100 aed) and seem to have less fish."

We then went to the zoo which was great and not too much information but lots for the kids to see. Finally, the glass bottomed boat was great and the kids got to feed the fish. Really good value for money."

            "review": "Shark Tunnel is a must!. The Underwater Zoo was awesome! I think you have to pay seperately for the shark tunnel and the Aquarium. I can't recall. The Shark Tunnel has such great photo ops and it is so neat to see the sharks that close up and not to mention all the other fish in the water. The Aquarium on the 2nd floor of the mall was fun too though. Most of the fish tanks are open ones so you can bend over and see the fish from the top so that was neat. They have a tank which has all the fish portrayed in Finding Nemo. Only complaint I have about it all is the other patrons. Other people were tapping on the glass and scaring the fish. It was ridiculous. Obviously they've never seen Free Willy. The best exhibit was the Penguins though! They have a few different kinds such as Emporer Penguins etc. and they are very friendly. The tanks are really designed to give you the closest experience possible to the animals. I had fun but it's not that big so remember that if you are wary of paying a high admission fee."

Amazed at the underwater zoo and what great value it was for AED 50 each. A price of two coffees is normally AED 50 in Dubai so very competitively priced. You think because you see the big mall aquarium you have seen everything but its totally different in the underwater zoo. We saw penguims otters, eels, pirahnas, sea horses, massive crabs and a variety of wierd and wonderful fish that were fantastic. Well worth a visit."

Located inside the Dubai mall, the aquarium is dubbed the largest in the world\u2026 having won the Guiness Book of World Records as the largest acrylic viewing panel of the world. It takes its role of educating the public very seriously and its tours are designed with this in mind, in an enjoyable hands-on way.Highlights include feeding time for the enormous Sand Tiger Sharks and the majestic Stingrays. The aquarium & underwater zoo is a mecca for marine-loving individuals a large collection of over 30,000 types of sea life.Everyone there is sure to enjoy the view and immerse your senses in a stimulating environment of vivid underwater colours and stunning marine life. They have an experience called shark dive \u2013 an opportunity to have a diving experience in an aquarium environment. I didn\u2019t do it this time, but next time, I certainly will ditch my street threads for a wetsuit to dive with sharks.(www.perfyi.wordpress.com)"
