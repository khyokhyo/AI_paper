Make sure you pick a day with nice weather and you can catch public transport getting off at Circular Quay. You could walk around the harbour bridge, operahouse, botanical gardens. Thia would take about 45minutes Make aure you are in comfy walking shoes and hat!The Opera bar is great for brunch, or a drink over looking the harbour at night."

A lazy morning walk through the Botanical Gardens with the vast variety of plants along the harbor and back to the Opera House, one of the more interesting walks in Sydney.You get amazing vista of the Bridge and Opera House from the path and across the harbor to north Sydney, all the way the back drop of birds singing and Cockatoo's squawking from the tree tops. Just a wonderful way to spend a morning. Not may walks end at the iconic shape of the Sydney Opera House."

Started on the steps of the magnificent Opera House, then strolled through the lovely gardens with amazing plant specimens (like the century old Woolemi pine). Saw at least one bride being photographed. Coincidentally or not, a plane overhead spelled out \"Forever\" with a tiny heart. Final touch: a wild white yellow crested Cockatoo greeting us loudly from his perch right above us."

Across the Quay you have great views of the Rocks and the Harbour Bridge not to to mention the buzz of the ferries and and other recreational watercraft coming and going. Once you proceed around Bennelong Point ( the site of the Opera House) you move seamlessly into the Royal Botanic Gardens. I think these gardens go back to 1816 and are free, in the heart of the City and have magnificent harbour views. Not to be missed!"

The walk from the Sydney Opear House to the Botanic Garden and Mrs Macquarie's Chair is one of the modt spectacular walk in any city in the world. With the Opera House and The Sydney Bridge in the background walking along the waterfront is very relaxing with beautiful lawn, you are actually encourage to lie and walk on the lawn unlike some other countries' gardens. See the jurassic fern at Botanic Garden which is rich in a huge variety of plants. Do the walk and you will go home delighted."

Started off at the Opera House and walked to the left path to catch the little train for a relaxed tour of the gardens...breath taking where the Lotus and flowering water lilies were... I had not seen how big the Lotus flowers are until then. Took our grandchildren into the little cafe located near the Palm Grove for a treat. Lovely service and great coffee and food.The only drawback we found was limited parking, you had to be there early to get a decent parking spot. The trees in the park are just so beautiful and shady...I love trees.Fantastic views also."

Sample from restaurants or have a coffee or wine. Continued on and walk around the Opera House. Do a tour inside the Opera House see the view of the Harbour from inside. There are frequent shows, concerts, ballets, or Operas to buy tickets for. Carry on with your walk just beyond the O.H. along the waterline into the Gardens. There are paths and in the middle a cafe and restaurant along a short creek, with lily ponds. A few green houses are higher up the hill and if you continue across and up you can go to the art gallery or back into the city."

The large greenhouse is spectacular and the view cannot be beaten. Sydney harbour always spectacular no-matter what with the iconic Sydney Bridge and the iconic Opera House.

The harbour always buzzing and a great place to start."

If you keep walking along the path keeping the ocean to your immediate left you will end up at Mrs. Macquarie's chair. This is a great place to get some photos of BOTH the opera house and the bridge in one shot. You may also be lucky and get an ocean liner departing as you take your photos."

You can detour to the Australian Museum on the corner of Park and College streets. Continuing along College street you can visit St Mary's Cathedral.Crossing Prince Albert road will bring you to MacQuarie street and the Hyde Park Barracks Museum, the Mint, Sydney Hospital, the NSW Parliament and the State Library. Behind these buildings is the Domain - now used as a multipurpose open space, it was originally used in 1788 by the first governor Arthur Phillip.Just beyond the Domain are the Botanic Gardens, which are vast and contain so much to see.Head towards the east and Mrs MacQuaries road will take you to Mrs MacQuaries chair - a sandstone bench cut into the rock in 1810 by convicts.At Mrs MacQuaries Point you can see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge side by side.Continuing around Farm Cove brings you back to te Botanic Gardens and finally the Opera House."

The Opera House is located at the northwest part of the gardens, which gives you enough time to grab something to eat or a quick drink before you head to the gardens to enjoy the relaxation time, chat with friends or have a quick run.I tend to take friends and family along to this walk as they get the feel of how most Sydneysiders are around this area. Most of the time we take a blanket with us to have a little picnic around and enjoy the sunset. Is a beautiful sight although you get less than optimal photos of the Opera House and the Bridge.If you are visiting (tourist) my city, I will suggest to you buying a bag of walnuts (or dried fruit like apricots) as the Cockatoo's love them and you will be attracting them to you. Cockatoos eat around 4:50pm to 6pm (Spring or Fall) or a little bit later in Summer and they are located east of the gardens. Be gentle with the birds and avoid over feeding them.If you come here early in the morning is beautiful too, but the number of other activities to do is reduced. In this scenario, I would walk first the botanic gardens towards the opera house to finish it with a brunch at the cafes and restaurants of Circular Quay... or walk a bit further (especially on weekends) towards the rocks and enjoy the Rocks Market."

Imagine strolling through acres of greenery and exotic plants of the Royal Botanic Gardens and still being able to see the city skyline with the skyscrapers and the busy Sydney Harbour in front of you. Look for trees that are nearly 200 years old and vegetables planted by the early settlers to the Colony. Visit Macquarie Chair and get a clear view of the iconic Opera House with its famous roof gleaming in the sun against a clear blue sky. You may be fortunate enough to witness a wedding on the grounds.Watch the busy ferry and tourist boats as they sail in the Harbour and see the many kayaks that cut through the water.

            "review": "A Relaxing Walk. On a recent trip to Sydney I had a few hours to spare and, rather than hit the shops, I decided to stroll in an area that not too many people realised has great historical significance.Starting from the Opera House (Bennalong Point) and armed with a little bit of local knowledge I walked around the foreshores of Farm Cove, skirting the northern edge of the Royal Botanical Gardens. Bennalong Point was named after an Aboriginal gentleman called Bennalong, a favourite of Governor Phillip, who used to spend long periods of time in the area contemplating who knows what. Prior to the Opera House being built the site was used as a tram depot. Man-of-War steps was used by naval ship captains as they visited Government House to pay their respects to the NSW Governor. Farm Cove was named because of the vegetables that were originally grown in the area to augment food supplies in the early days of the colony. The botanical gardens came about following the plantings of Mrs Macquarie and later residents of Government House.The walk was extremely relaxing, away from the noise of city traffic, with the harbour foreshores on one side and the greenery of the gardens on the other. There were lots of options on the route I took. On this occasion I strolled around to Mrs Macquarie's Chair then back through the gardens and the domain, Hyde Park and back to the hotel. Very pleasant."

Beautiful to see at night.Our coach briefly managed to drop us off almost at the door! However a little more difficult with our after performance pickup as coaches not now allowed near Opera House for security reasons, and a little walk required.Steps, lifts, escalators got us efficiently to the JS Thestre and great A reserve seating . Very comfortable , excellent viewing, and amazing acoustics. Prices in our area seem to be around $ 110 .00 pp for our group. Interval for about 20 mins after a couple of hours - bar and usual facilities for patrons.Sydney Opera House is an architectural panorama - with a very interesting history . Must be the most photographed building in Australia, Tourists everywhere!"

Then it's an easy walk down through the Botanic Gardens. There are so many different walkways that it can feel like a different trip each time. But no need to worry about getting lost, it is really well signposted. There is a lovely cafe in the middle of the Botanic gardens if you felt like a light lunch or coffee. Continue on toward the Opera House with a walk around the harbour foreshore when you round the bend you will see the majestic and iconic Opera House looming larger than life.

I am so glad we did because it was beautiful and so tranquil! It was a nice & sunny day outside. The scenery is spectacular and the Botanical Gardens is so beautiful. In between walking, we sat down on benches, in the gardens, just to take in nature at it's best! The design, of the Sydney Opera House, is amazing to view in person and up close.

There are many detours to take through the beautiful gardens, especially in spring and summer. There are also several places to eat, each with a lovely outlook.

The gardeners work hard to have the beds and vegetation in perfect order. There are historical plaques through the gardens to remind the visitor of the 200 year history. Stop at the bookshop and the cafe. We packed our own lunch to eat outside. My friends visited some of the special attractions but I like to just sit and take in the views to Farm Cove. Walk around to Mrs Macquarie's Chair or go straight to the Sydney Opera House. I love the curve of the giant sails as the SOH comes into view. Government House is adjacent. I always feel restored after a visit to the gardens."

This time it was with friends from out of town.Whether you're from in or out of town, if you have the time then take the time: a walk from the rocks, through the quay up to the opera house and then through the gardens is terrific on a nice day.You have the harbour lapping to your left, the grass, gardens and trees on your right and above them, in the background, the city skyline. There are a number of paths through the gardens, you can take 10 minutes or an hour, whatever suits. To me this is Sydney !"

You can see the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge,mthe harbour itself, and get some lovely photos along the waters edge and in the botanic gardens itself. I really don't understand some of the negative reviews of the gardens - people writing things like 'it's just gardens' - well, yes, it is just gardens - what exactly were you expecting? I'd say do your homework & if you don't want to see botanic gardens, don't go there!The walk there from the opera house, however, allows you to see the iconic Sydney landmarks for free, in a lovely garden setting. If gardens aren't for you, just stay along the path that runs around the waters edge, or even catch a ferry from circular quay and see it all from the water. Personally, I enjoy the walk between the iconic sights, with a breeze off the water and plenty of people to watch along the way - the fact that it has the Botanic Gardens as a backdrop is simply an added bonus."

A short flat, stroll from Sydney's iconic Opera House to the Royal Botanic Gardens, along a path adjacent to a stone wall, edging Sydney Harbour. You can see most of the highlights of Sydney in a few short steps. Really nice on a sunny day, not so nice on a wet one as there is no cover available. On weekend mornings and weekday lunchtimes, there are crowds of joggers intermingling with tourists on pathways, all around the park. That isn't so nice, but typical of a modern society in a cosmopolitan city. The pathway around the water takes you to Mrs Macquarie's Chair and onwards to the Andrew Boy Charlton Public Swimming Pool, facing the naval base at Garden Island. The path continues through the Domain, past the Art Gallery of NSW and on to St Mary's Cathedral. The Botanic Gardens offer a feeling of being close to nature, with examples of fauna and flora throughout the park. I like to read the signs on the tags on the plants, which fun for adults and children, alike. The rose garden up on top of the adjacent hill is really beautiful in season. There is a restaurant and a caf\u00e9 in the park and plenty of public toilet facilities. A worthy sojourn, if you are staying in the City or just visiting for a few hours."

I do this walk along Circular Quay, up past the Opera House and on to and through the Botanic Gardens, often en route to the equally wonderful Art Gallery of NSW, just across the road on the opposite side of the gardens every time I visit Sydney.Each place is worth time for detailed exploration. As a walk, it captures the essence of Sydney, including great views across the Harbour of The Harbour Bridge and equally across, approaching and behind the Opera House.This is also a walk where you can \"see and be seen\" in equal measure.Wear comfortable shoes and protect yourself from the sun. Even on cool days there is little protection from the sun and refection from the water adds to its intensity.Simply enjoy this glorious walk and allow at least an hour or two to take it easy, drink in the sights and to also enjoy the Botanic Gardens.A \"must do\" whenever you visit Sydney!"

As usual the view as you walk towards the Opera House takes your breath away, with the stunning Harbour Bridge and sparkling harbour to the left and then you cast your eyes on the sails of the Opera House. My grandchildren loved to run up and down the steps of the opera house, counting the number of steps and checking out all the little nooks and crannies and exciting places to crawl and climb. We then explored the inside of the opera house which is very interesting.Then on to the Botanic Gardens where the fig trees were the favourite for them.

There were problems with the audio system being used, however, it was noted that it is being upgraded. That was a distraction.if you take a tour, there may be discounts for current shows and events.During the tour we learned about The Opera On the Harbour and took advantage of rush seats. This out door opera was a highlight of our trip. The back drop was the setting sun behind the Sydney Bridge and Opera House. Beautiful!"

Along the harbor I saw and photographed some very unusual fish (stop, look over the wall into the water...remember the old Athabaskan Grandmother's advice in Michener's Alaska: \"when hunting the giant woolly mammoth, remember the mice\"). Likewise near the Garden Shop Pond there were dozens of Magpie, Ibis and Sulphur Crested Cockatoos!! Great pics!!! Enjoy."

When you get to Lady Macquarie's chair, most days you get to see someone having their wedding photos taken against this wonderful backdrop. some of the trees are so old and the branches so large they have them propped up so not to break off. The trees and plants have a name plate if you are interested and the grass is so soft to walk on. When I worked I (and lots of others) jogged this route everyday. In the middle of the walk are stairs we ran up and down to strengthen our legs. You will find bubblers and benches for when you are tired or thirsty. Just the best place to relax or get fit."

I met them at the Dawes Point Wharf beside Sydney Harbour Bridge. We walked around Circular Quay to the Opera House and then wandered through the beautiful Botanic Gardens. After a bite to eat in the shade, we headed for the Art Gallery and wandered through the galleries. Next, we made a short walk to St Mary's Cathedral, which has excellent proportions and a beautiful stained glass rose window, and then crossed the road to Hyde Park to admire the Archibald Fountain. Its strong Art Deco sculptures are a delight. Moving along to the other section of Hyde Park is the minimalist Art Deco War Memorial with a poignant sculpture of a fallen soldier inside and brilliant high relief sculptures outside.We then headed to the central shopping and business district for lunch. Later, we popped into St Andrews Cathedral, Sydney Town Hall and then took time to explore the architectural delights of the well maintained Queen Victoria Building with its beautiful staircases, patterned marble floors and leadlight glass. After a downhill walk, we arrived at Darling Harbour. We observed the activities of visitors along the waterfront and on the water, where ferries and boats of all description criss-cross at regular intervals. It was happy hour, so we managed to find shady seats to enjoy a few drinks while watching the action.We continued on to Barangaroo, Sydney's newest waterfront park and then returned to Dawes Point Wharf.The only cost was for food and drink. It was an extremely hot day, so a hat, sun block and comfortable clothing were essential. Much of our touring avoided the worst of the sun. This exploration of Sydney took 7 hours and proves that you can 'do' Sydney cheaply. I thoroughly enjoyed being a guide and a visitor in my home town."

After a ferry ride on the Sydney Harbour it was time to take a stroll and what better way to do it than to take a walk along the foreshores starting from Circular quay towards the Opera house leading to the Royal Botanical gardens and beyond. The Opera House a beautiful architectural masterpiece and the Sydney Harbour Bridge in the background in close proximity was breathtaking indeed. The Princess Cruise Liner berthed alongside the Rocks provided an added attraction to the many visitors who had flocked on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. There were many foreign tourists as well as locals mingling with each other lapping up the beautiful sights. There are several entry points to the Opera House but everyone's favourite seems to be the long flights up to the top where many gather around to take photos from different angles with the city skyline on one side and the Sydney Harbour on the other. It is also a favourite spot for many wedding photos. The well paved walkway is normally very busy and you have to make way for other road users as well. In summer it can get very hot but there's always a cool breeze blowing across the harbour to make you feel quite comfortable and refreshed. Also there are trees planted right along providing plenty of shade and there are benches to sit and relax. You can also take a walk along the Royal botanical gardens if you turn right or you can continue your walk alongside the harbour. If you are a keen gardner a visit to the Royal Botanical gardens is a must where you will not only see Australian natives but also other rare species of plants. Stay tuned to the sounds of the Kookaburra a rare bird found only in this part of the world. It will stay proudly perched on the branch calling it's mates to join while you take photos before it will suddenly fly away reminding you it is no ordinary bird. The walk will take you past Lady Macquarie's Chair where you get a panoramic view of the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge overlooking the Harbour to remind you how much Sydney has changed from it's humble beginnings in such a short period of time into one of the most beautiful cities in the world."

Huge area with lots of sculptures and plants (obviously). Not a lot of flowers, it is autumn but lovely all the same. Also went past an area full of wild cuckatoos which was an awesome sight. Lots of other birds around as well."

The place is not only great for its flora but is a bit historical, as Royal Botanic Gardens were opened in 1816 (probably one of the oldest 'museum piece' in Australia). You can also see \"Sydney City\" as the background and the tops of Harbour Bridge and Opera House also jut out over the green horizon made of trees and flowers. If the place is visited on the hot day when the sky is blue (just as it happened to us) it is just perfect quintessence of Sydney."

Signage is good, and there are signs for the restaurant and welcome center, different areas of the garden, and routes to the exits near the Art Museum. This is, in fact, a lovely way to walk from the Opera House to the Art Museum. Currently, there is some major construction occurring in the midst of the garden, necessitating some detours, but nothing major.

Perhaps you want to go via the cafe and grab a bite to eat. For tired tourists this is a lovely place to go and chill out, On a sunny day you will see people lying on the grass having a nap! It is a great space for children to run off a bit of energy too. There is an interesting sandstone installation that children love to climb. My grandchildren like to sit in it to eat their lunch!

The Opera House Gate to the Gardens is adjacent to the Opera House, and the most popular walk simply follows the sea wall around Farm Cove, ending up at Mrs Macquarie's Chair, where there are wonderful views - indeed the \"iconic\" views - of the House with the Harbour Bridge behind. You can continue beyond this point along the shore of Wooloomooloo Bay, emerging close to the Art Gallery of NSW, then walk back to Circular Quay through the main body of the Gardens. This loop walk, as long as you don't stop too long to take in the wonderful panorama of the Harbour, or pop into the Gallery (free), can be completed in less than 2 hours, so it is ideal for visitors on a tight schedule. But equally, you could fruitfully spend half a day in the Gardens, which are possibly Australia's finest, and certainly its oldest."

We took the Sky-train from the airport directly to Circular Quay. From there you can walk along the water to the opera house and then on to the botanical gardens, the museum, do some shopping at the mall, have a bite to eat and return back to the airport having gotten to do some sight seeing, gotten some much needed exercise after a 15 hour flight from LAX and enjoyed a sample of what is SYDNEY. This introduction to Sydney was enough to plan a separate trip to Australia some time in the future."

Plants and trees are (sometimes) labeled but it is mostly a great place for strolling and admiring the beautiful landscape and harbor views. Distances are shorter than they look on a map, the slope is gentle, and there are frequent well-marked signs noting the distance and walking time to the next point. The garden shop at the center is very nice, and there is a cafe too. Lots of local birds, unusual tropical plants, and huge interesting trees make this a must-do walk. It is well-used by local residents with babies in prams, lying on the lawn in the sun, or taking wedding photos in the Herb Garden. Do this one."

Helpful especially if you're pushing prams or wheelchairs. It's great for all ages. Allow 2-3hrs for an easy stroll and photographs, or more for picnics. Gates close later in summer.Make your way along Macquarie St, and head towards the State Library. Enter the large gates to the Botanical Gardens via the western side opposite the State Library or alternatively via the eastern side not far from the Domain and NSW Art Gallery.Pick up a map of the gardens and choose your path for your walk. Enjoy the rose gardens, cacti gardens, native trees, little bridges, ponds and several sculptures/statues throughout the gardens. Find the story behind the Wishing Tree and relax at various places as you meander down the paths. It's a good idea to pack lots of water and perhaps a picnic lunch or you can visit the cafe/tea house.Continue to make your way down towards the harbour taking advantage of all the photo opportunities of the gardens, trees, sculptures, cityscapes and harbour.Don't forget to visit Government House and it's gardens too while you're there.You can head down towards Mrs Macquarie's Chair and walk back along the harbour waterside or take the shorter western path (steps involved) behind Government House to wind your way down to the Opera House. Look out for the sculpture on the slope opposite the Opera House called Earth Mother. You could combine your visit to the Botanical Gardens with a trip to the NSW Art Gallery or the State Library. All are free entry. Visit all three in one day."

I prefer to walk down from the NSW Art Gallery through the many paths of the Botanic Gardens to the lower pathway that is beside the water and takes you to the Opera House. You have lots of things to see whether on the water or in the gardens. There is a lovely caf\u00e9 in the middle gardens as well as some great options on the lower boardwalk looking towards the Overseas passenger terminal. Definitely a walk to be enjoyed at least once, and preferably more often"

The Opera House is spectacular as a place maker and icon for Sydney.

The Gardens create a serene, soft and quiet experience so close to all the vibrant metropolis nearby. Its a can't miss relationship."

First time ever going to the 200 year old Botanical Gardens, just around the corner from the Opera House on Sydney Harbour. Free. Cafe, gardens and gorgeous photo opps along the waterfront path to Mrs. Macquarie's chair. Large shady trees and grassy areas to sit and enjoy the serenity. A must see while in Sydney. Take a picnic lunch, or if lucky, go to the St George outdoor cinema on the harbourfront."

The Botanic Gardens sprawl down to the Harbour with an abundance of native and imported plants and trees, open grassed areas, a large pond with ducks and the occasional statue to get you away from it all. The statue of Captain Arthur Phillip near Macquarie Street reminds of Nelson in Trafalgar Square. Phillip was the first British Governor who brought the mostly convict settlers to Australia in 1788 and the rest is history. What the displaced inhabitants thought of this invasion at the the time as not known. Farm cove on the Harbour is so called as the first farms were established here to support the colony."

The paved path takes you literally around the waterfront, all the way to Mrs Macquarie\u2019s\u2019 chair (sometimes erroneously called Lady Macquarie\u2019s Chair) then along opposite Garden Island, past the Boy Charlton Olympic sized pool and up to the NSW Art Gallery. Ou may either return the way you came, or through the city last many historic buildings if they are of interest.You can walk the Harbourside path for half an hour and back again, or go to the Art Gallery taking about an hour each way. With delightful views across Sydney Harbour on one side, and a world-class collection of trees and plants on the other side, this is a piece of Australia which everybody should see and enjoy."

So after you have had you fill of the glorious sights(hopefully on a sunny day) walk into the Botanic Gardens, if your a gardener you'll enjoy the Rose and Herb Gardens as well as plants from all over the world. Has a fruit bat colony which is interesting but smelly, the Aborigines used to eat them so they probably taste better when cooked but heard they carry disease. Also a Restaurant in the gardens but don't think they serve fruit bat but nice location for a meal.I can spend all day there just looking at the various plants and trees, usually bring my own lunch find a nice piece of lawn and relax in the sun. Some homeless people sleep in the park at night and I guess if I was homeless I couldn't find a better place to wake in the morning. Well I can but I haven't met her yet.

You will probably start your walk from Circular Quay, which is one of the main transport hubs of Sydney, connecting harbor ferries, trains and buses to all other parts of this modern metropolis.You can see the Opera House from Circular Quay so just follow your nose and walk around the Harbour to the end of the Opera House site, which is known as Bennelong Point. Pause to admire the harbor, the foreshores and the yachts that constantly sail this magnificent waterway. Continue down the other side of the Opera House and you will come to Man o'War Jetty.Keep on the harbourside waterline to your left and you will come to Farm Cove, which was the site of the colony's earliest efforts to feed itself back in the 18th Century.From there it is only a short walk to the Botanic Gardens, where you can wander to your heart's content for as many hours as you wish.If you want to extend your walk keep following the harbor shore line and you will come to an area known as The Domain, and beyond that to the famous Mrs Macquarie's Chair. Mrs Macquarie was the wife of an early governor of New South Wales and it is said that this spot was one of her favourite spots to sit and contemplate the beauty of Sydney Harbour. You can do the same today, but your view will take in the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Sydney Opera House, and the modern city of Sydney that Mrs Macquarie and her husband could only have dreamed of.The Opera House to Botanic Gardens walk is about 3 km. The extended walk I have mentioned here is about 5 km."

Walking through the forecourt or around the most Iconic edifice in the southern hemisphere is a thrill in itself, but then going into the magnificently well kept and varied plant life of the botanic gardens is an experience that I never tire of, nor will you. There are many routes to take through the gardens, and even after dozens of treks, there is always something to be seen for the first time. Trees from every continent, flowers of every variety and colour, built along a foreshore of a beautiful harbour, will capture your senses and soothe your soul. Keep your eyes moving and you will see several varieties of birds, living in harmony with nature!"

You can wind your way through the Botanic Gardens where the trees and flowers and shrubs are labelled. It's fascinating! If you continue along the harbour you end up at a stone outcrop called Lady Macquarie's Chair (referencing the wife of an early colonial governor.) The view from here across the Opera House to The Harbour Bridge is spectacular, especially if you see it at sunset. It is suitable for everybody from solo to families to teens (in the list below you can only tick one!)"

On advice of the check in clerk at the Intercontinental I spent the early morning on this walk - glad I did!I walked down from Macquarie street to avoid staring directly into the sun - starting near the Music Conservatory. First stop Opera House for pictures of the Harbor, then a quick trip pat the wharf and on over to Pitt and George to find a takeaway breakfast place that was open so early (ended up at The Wood Roaster ). Then back to this walk, and on into the now open (7am) Botanical Gardens for the view and my meal, then back to the hotel.Be aware that the Botanical Gardens are behind a gate and the Opera House and wharf is not; so if you are an early bird start at that end. Also the crowds began to reach the Opera House around 7 so start early for quiet and crowded photos."

If you want to walk the perimeter od the opera house, taking photos, and then stroll through the entire Botanical Gardens, it could easily consume two to three hours. Another option is to take the small tram/cart that start from the opera house entrance to the gardens, and ride lady the various points of entrance in the gardens ( about 20, if you stay on the cart), or hop off and spend time at just the specific point which interest you the most. The tram runs every 39 minutes so, you might have a wait, depending on how long you stay at the rose garden or other stop."

Strolled around the Royal Botanical Garden to Mrs. Macquarie point was very pleasing and soothing too to enjoy the cool breeze and beautiful garden landscape along the way. Once I arrived at the Mrs. Macquarie point, it was BIG WOW! to be able to see the panoramic view of Sydney CBD, the Harbour Bridge and the fame Opera House. A must visit spot in Sydney and there are many benches available to simply sit back and enjoy the great view while watching the sunset behind the skyscrapers. A very memorable walk indeed!"

Everytime I come to Sydney, I never miss going to see the grandeur of the Opera house, have a selfie and show friends that the Opera House is a must place where ones photo should be taken. It's a must and I never get tired looking at it. The architecture is truly a work of art and it's a must see place when you're here in Sydney. From the Opera House it is a beautiful walk always to the Botanical Garden, historic and a truly relaxing place, where one can see the endemic trees of Australia, beautiful rose garden and more."

One can readily walk from the Sydney Opera House through the gardens, now 200 years old, and down through Hyde park to the ANZAC memorial.

The garden has a nice collection and there are numerous birds resident as well. If you are a jogger you will find heaven starting at Circular Quay running out around the Opera House and then back through any of a variety of paths to the St. James or Museum rail stops.

That's much more recommended than the walk TO the Botanic Gardens!Very scenic, great views, although it is in the open most of the way, so not such a great idea in the rain. But in good weather, it's a nice wide path and with great scenery so a big crowd pleaser.Please note, the Botanic Gardens closes at Sunset. So you can certainly take the walk from the Opera House to the gardens after dark - but not the walk through the gardens being talked about."

Take a show in one of its concert halls, music or ballet there is something always on. As for the Botanical Gardens, they are amazing, the have extensive gardens as you would expect along with galleries and the location of Sydney's original farm trial areas for crop types.

Then it's a picturesque stroll up though the Botanical Gardens (good restaurant there as well as a cafe) to the Art Gallery of New South Wales. A bus from the Gallery takes me back to the QVB Building."

Depending on where you stay, you can walk to the Opera House, take photos of all the spectacular architecture, turn towards the RBC (Royal Botanic Gardens), and wander to your heart's content through the lush greenery and amazing huge trees. There's a tour to see the insides of the Opera House (one hour), but it was our last day and no cash to spare, so can't comment. The Botanic Gardens are huge, though, so you can take an hour or a day to tour through them, and there's no charge."

After finding the Opera House tours weren't running over the weekend, we took advantage of the sunny day and headed down the stairs to the Botanic Gardens. Wow, despite is still being winter here in Sydney, flowers were in bloom everywhere. We also lucked out and got some great photos of rainbow lorikeets, cockatoos, and the Australian ibis up close. And there were so many vantage points to get a great view photo of the city, Opera House, Harbour Bridge, the harbour itself, and the ships. There are many different paths to take and all were an easy walk - mostly flat and paved. Facilities are available if you need a restroom, something to eat, or would like a gift shop memento (they have very nice items for sale). We didn't find the paths overly crowded and the park was very clean. Would take this walk regularly if I lived here!"

Visit Mrs Macquarie's chair and enjoy the views. Fort Dennison can be easily seen along the way along with all the activities on the harbour. Stay until the sun goes down with good sunset photos behind the opera house & harbour bridge. You can do this as a return walk from the opera house or come in from the gardens and loop back to the opera house. Enjoy an expensive glass of wine at the opera house bar overlooking the harbour or join an opera house tour. We did both."

Inside the main gates, walking tracks take you right around the edge of Fern Cove or into the centre of the gardens alongside Government House, the residence of the New South Wales Governor.Taking a leisurely walk and choosing the walking pathways as you go, you will come across beautiful sculptured plants and hedges, statues, and beautiful views of the opera house from different angles, and the city skyline.Open daily from 6.30am until sunset, if walking these huge grounds is to much, jump on the hop on hop off train, for a fee this will take you throughout the gardens with convenient stops. Free entry into the gardens.The 30 hectares of gardens and grounds right alongside the CBD is a peaceful way to escape the busy city life and enjoy the atmosphere.Guided walks are on daily from 10.30am at the Garden Shop.Botanic Gardens Restaurant is open from 8.30am - 4pm with Australian cuisine, breakfasts and lunches, served on picturesque verandahs with garden views.The walk took me right around to Macquarie Street, where there is another entrance to the gardens, and the walk back towards Circular Quay is downhill. Passing the Conservatorium Of Music and seeing the expressway and tunnel.The Sydney Tower Eye can also be seen from the gardens, with wildlife and plants and sitting areas positioned throughout the grounds to stop and rest.You can walk as much or as little,but you can be surprised how far you walk with all the sights and views to take in.Government House is also open from Friday to Sunday from 10.30am to 3pm, a look at the Governors residence is allowed, free entry and a highlight of a walk around the gardens.The views across Sydney Harbour to the Harbour Bridge and Opera House are breathtaking, and walking alongside the Government House path, you get the most spectacular views of the harbour, opera house, harbour bridge, and when a passenger cruise ship is in port, adds to the amazing views from this viewing point.The views are elevated so that you can look down towards the steps of the opera house and take in all the ferry and boating activity on the harbour.My visit was recent during a cool winters day, but while it was sunny, it was perfect weather for walking, and totally recommended.Access from the gardens onto Macquarie Street then Bridge Street back to the centre of the city.A must for all visitors to Sydney's Circular Quay.If you are keen to go further, follow the roadway that will take you into Sydney Domain, and Hyde Park. Quite an adventurous walk, take a bottle of water and do the walk at a leisurely pace.I've visited Sydney many times, and always missed out the gardens, it was well worth it and enjoyed it more than I'd imagined! Great photo opportunities of Sydney's main icons and the gardens."

A performing arts centre and a UNESCO World heritage site, the Sydney Opera House designed by Danish architect J\u00f8rn Utzon, and formally opened on 20 October 1973, is indeed a breath taking site. A tour of the Opera House is a must. Wonder why its not Wonder of the World!"

We took the route from Botanical Garden (starting from Macquarie's chair) to Opera House (thinking of leaving the best for the last) but turned out that there are both equally great. We went there in the morning, hence enjoyed the fresh air on top of the amazing view. Do take time to enjoy the garden, the pond, and the great collection of plants & trees, while strolling to the Opera House along with the garden landscape. One of the minor thing happened was to locate the rest-room."

It's just an odd looking building up close! I did the tour, which I wish I could get my money back for as it wasn't great. The best thing about it was when it was the vivid light festival and the whole thing was lit up with a light projection. The gardens were actually nice, got some great pictures had a walk around with some friends and chilled out so all in all was ok! Overall don't go on the Opera House tour unless you like stuff like that as it is a waste of money in my opinion, but get a few pictures or the outside to say you've seen it! Gardens are worth a look!"

It's easy to get to Circular Quay and the Sydney Opera House.Once at the Opera House, make your way across the square in front, keeping the water to your left and you will find a footpath that goes in to the Botanical Gardens.I suggest an early start if it's a fine day, it can get pretty crowded along the path.Once in the Gardens, there are a variety of plants of course, and some special areas.I particularly like Palm Grove, the Succulents Garden, the Glass Pyramid and the Medicinal Herbs.When you need lunch or a snack, head for the Restaurant/Kiosk in the middle of the Gardens for a pie, hot dog or fries or else to the restaurant above for a more luxurious meal.If you love nature but can't go bush, take a blanket and your own food then do a picnic in the shade of the huge spreading Oak trees.You will enjoy your day!"

Lovely to walk along the harbour and see the ducks who enjoy paddling around Farm Cove, enjoy the Botancial Gardens.Get your heart pumping and do the stairs at Mrs Maquaries Chair a couple of times.From here I often walk down to Woolloomooloo along the wharfs, check out all the amazing boats and yachts moored there and do the other set of stairs (Stairs of Death-112 stairs) into Potts Point."

Then make your way back to the Opera House along the foreshore. Once at the Opera House continue on through the Botanic Gardens onto Macquarie Street. Or, follow the foreshore through the Botanic Gardens and past lady Macquarie's chair and on to the Sydney Art Gallery."

We didn't do our research on this dream architecture so didn't know what to expect. Once we got our tickets we were put into small groups for a guided tour & were given audio/headphones to communicate with the guide who was very informative. On the off set we were told there were plenty of stairs to climb, not wrong there. So if your motorbility is restricted please ask about access. (We did notice there were lifts). There are many theatres within, we were taken into four & were lucky even if only for ten minutes to see a ballet in rehearsal. The foyer of the O.H. has lush purple carpets, our guide told us a story about Pavarotti who was due in concert but alas 'couldn't' perform & the concert was relocated later that evening within another theatre in the building, this was because of his superstition - purple bringing bad luck! The views of the harbour are beautiful and the whole trip unforgettable. Moving on now taking in gentle stroll along the waters edge you come to The Botanic Gardens ( (free of charge) home of a 'flora showcase'. The many pathways, twists & turns make the walks so interesting, a place of sheer delight & beauty. We spent most of our day here totally unhurried meandering through the vegetation admiring nature at its best. The sculptures also add interest. There is a cafe, we had sandwiches but also needed a knife & fork to tackle them, mmmm delicious! Both attractions well worth a visit, Highly recommend."

It is such an iconic building, I couldn\u2019t believe I traveled all the way from NY and was looking at this building in person.Make sure you make your way to Mrs. Macquarie\u2019s chair for some beautiful photos of both the opera house and bridge together. The botanical gardens are spectacular and I took one of my best photos with the opera house and bridge in the background of the gardens.  A nice way to spend a few leisurely hours walking at your own pace and admiring the many gorgeous, colorful flowers along the way."

One of my favourite walks is to start at the Opera House and end up in the Botanic Gardens. By continuing along the foreshore all the way around to Mrs Macquarie's Chair you have the most relaxing walk with magnificent city and water views the whole way. There is something about being near water that soothes the soul. I enjoy this walk alone, with my partner and/or with my kids. There is something for everyone. You don't have to spend much money if you choose to take a picnic lunch with you. Alternatively, there are many restaurants/cafes on the walk to the Opera House or you can eat at a lovely cafe in the middle of the Gardens, sitting amongst the fabulous plantlife. There is also a more upmarket restaurant upstairs where most tables have extraordinary views looking down into the gardens with glimpses of the harbour. Walking all around these gardens,not just near the water, is a must, as I always seem to find something new everytime I visit. All in all a day well spent."

There is a venue for exhibitions which change regularly and are a well worth a look. The view on the waterfront is second to none and one can while away the time nicely in one of the several cafes and restaurants. It is possible to do an opera house tour but one needs to book in advance. Water taxis at $10 per person one way are available at the Man 'O War steps by the opera house. These go to various points around the waterfront. It is an easy walk into the city from both the Botanical Gardens and the opera house."

Attractions noted along the way include St. Mary's Cathedral, Hyde Park, Sydney Hospital, Military Barracks Museum, Mint, Parliament, National Library of New South Wales, the Royal Botanic Garden, and then, the Opera House.Second Walk - On Day 2, I entered the Royal Botanic Garden at the Macquarie Street. I visited its various areas that have beautiful flowers, huge trees, shrubs, ferns, fountains, statutes, etc. After visiting these areas, I simply followed the posted signs showing the arrows/directions towards the Opera House.The views are spectacular! I saw both the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House at this particular section of the Garden. Landmarks of the Garden include another statute, lawn areas, circular flower beds and a small pond. Staying on the left side of the path, I continued my walk until I reached the Opera House again. Which option is better for you? Start at the Opera House or at the Royal Botanic Garden?

I have done this walk many times usually starting at Hyde Park or Circular Quay but this time we walked via the domain & were delighted to find the stage set for Aida across form the Opera House in the gardens. This made our walk very exciting as we were able to check out the props and witness some of the preparations. Other than that the view is always great and so is all the flora . The Sydney Botanic gardens have a great collection of exotics as well as native trees and I highly recommend visitors to Sydney, who need to chill out a bit, to take this walk.."

My suggestion is to take off your shoes and walk along the grass rather than the path to really feel connected to the gardens. Skip the train ride, it's expensive and you will appreciate the gardens so much more by walking through them."

Not too crowded after main lunch hour, the quiet green space was soothing to the senses. Great views especially from Mrs Macquarie's point with plenty of photo opps for the tourist.Refreshed, we impulsively decided to walk further and ascended the Sydney Tower Eye for an aerial view of the city - amazing to see how far we had walked that afternoon!"

If I wanted to choose one spot on this walk to pause and reflect it would be this point, before I backtracked and wandered up through the spacious greenery of Sydney's Botanic Gardens. It is a marvellous walk, especially if you approach it, first time, at sea level. This is one of the beautiful harbours of the world. Going as far as Mrs Macquarie's Chair, takes you round the bottom of the garden to a point where you can look back to the Opera House and Bridge and then up the harbour. It's one of those very special places. Then, you can walk up the ridge or back to the bay around which you have walked and begin your exploration of the gardens. I never go with a plan, just wander to see what takes my fancy on any particular day. there's still a lot to see and enjoy. The bonus is you literally step out of the city and into a peaceful park."

This one of my walking (and running path), I usually start from circular quay (you can get train to Circular quay station or ferry to her) towards the Opera house, and then stand a while watching the bridge (it's really amazing and beautiful bridge). Continue the walk to the botanical garden, which the Elizabeth gate will be the closest one (the gate open and closed at various time during the year, please notice the opening hour), follow the water and you'll arrive at Ms Macquarie chair (1st governor's wife, where she used to sat there awaiting her husband). Here, you can see the Opera house with harbour bridge at the background (FYI - opera (april) and movie (Feb) held annually every year, YES every year :)) DO not stop here, continue further to ABC (Andrew Boy Charlton) pool, one of the salty water pool, and domain (another park in the middle of the city), further away you'll end up at hyde park, St Mary's Cathedral and Sydney tower. The whole trip usually took around 1 - 1.5 hour (slow walk + stop), if you run, just took you around 30-40 minutes :) Enjoy Sydney mate!!"

I guess the beauty is not good enough to just leave here and enjoy for all, but those new mini-cameras located at each entrance should help stop the plants from walking out. If you start from the Hospital end and work your way towards the Opera house makes for a nice view when you come around the walk and see the Opera house waiting for you.

You'll also take in Government House, the Conservatorium of Music, and if you venture far enough, the Museum of NSW. There are a lot of interesting historical stop offs and statues along the way. No point in going into them here, just grab a free park map. Allow a couple of hours to stroll, and you can actually come out in the heart of the city's shopping district if you desire.

There are excellent paths through the gardens to see cockatoos and other birds and the walk along the water watching the ferries and seeing the Opera House was lovely. One of my best photos of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge came from the Botanical Gardens with beautiful red flowers in the foreground."

You will pass through the original beginnings of Sydney's history and learn so much about how the area came to be. The walk is an easy, fairly level trek, so other than having a good pair of walking shoes, nothing else is needed. You'll find lot's pubs, restaurants, shops and sights to see. Check it out. I highly recommend it."

Botanic Gardens on the other hand are free and spread out over large area hence allow plenty of time to explore. Mrs Macquarie's Chair is worth a visit and there are good views of the Harbour from the headland nearby. If you want to take loads of photos the lighting is likely to be better in the afternoon."

Witness the fantastic and advanced samples of Australian fauna and garden vignettes. All kinds of birds can be found feeding and roosting in the trees and ponds. Walking around the headlands is a great way to take in the scope of this complex harbour scene, the opera house, harbour bridge and many bays filled with an assortment of ferrys, tour boats and yachts create never ending stream of movement upon the water. Well worth it if you are wanting some time out from the busy-ness of the city."

One cannot go wrong w parkland open skies and The Sydney Opera House ."

There is no view like the Opera House, Harbour bridge and the foreshore of Kirribilli and Cremorne across the water. Sail boats, sunshine and ferries make a busy backdrop to the short but enjoyable walk to the Botanic gardens. Until recently, the gardens were home to thousands of bats, amazing to see, but sometimes the huge numbers could be unnerving. In their wisdom, the park authorities have chased them away leaving the gardens more peaceful and possibly more hygienic but less entertaining. Pity they can't do something about the caf\u00e9. Apparently, if you can afford the classy restaurant that shares the same area, you are free from the predations of the local fauna but, if you sit outside to eat the rather mundane offerings of the caf\u00e9 then beware birds of every size that will eat your food, defecate on your table and generally make what could be an enjoyable experience something of a nightmare. Food left on table by customers is slow to be cleared allowing the birds a messy field day - it's a big turn off and the area feels decidedly unloved."

It covers quite a large area but is well signposted and there are lots of places where you can stop, grab a seat and just take in the views whether scenic or the flora on display. During our walk we encountered a wedding party, lots of families having picnics, some beautiful trees & shrubs and we also stumbled over an outdoor cinema which the locals tell us is famous for being rained on!We elected to follow the coastal path round to Mrs Macquarie's chair which was apparently carved in 1810 for the then governor's wife to sit on to view the harbour, and then headed inland to the Art Gallery of NSW which is well worth a visit. The walk took us about an hour but that includes stops to take photos and rest in the shade from the fierce sun. it was a lovely peaceful interlude in what is a busy, bustling city."

            "review": "Beautiful gardens - befriend the cockatoos!. My partner and I stayed in Sydney for 8 nights in February 2014, just outside the Botanic Gardens. We did a lot of walking around the harbour and up into the Botanic Gardens, and it's a lovely way to relax in the city. The walk from the world-famous Opera House up into the gardens winds around the coast past Mrs Macquarie's Chair (a carved rock on the point of the peninsula offering great views over the harbour). The point itself can get a bit busy with tourists, but the gardens are so expansive that you will find plenty of breathing space. It's also a very popular spot for joggers.You'll spot loads of wildlife on your walk - everything from rainbow lorikeets, cockatoos and kookaburras down to creepier species like life-curler and orbweaver spiders. The route is well sign-posted, and the signs have approximate walking times to other places of interest particularly within the gardens (we found that the times were generous, and at a comfortable walking pace we normally arrived a bit earlier than the estimate). You can also befriend the cockatoos if you have any bits of sandwich or bread on you - although caution is advised as the birds are gregarious with no fear of humans, so you may be swarmed if you start feeding them (and cockatoos have huge beaks, claws and mites!). You are openly encouraged to \"enjoy\" the grass of the gardens, which is very refreshing when so many parks these days order you to keep off the grass.Great way to enjoy some of the beautiful scenery around the busy harbour."

It's a beautiful place to stroll around.There's a large pond in one area with small islands in the middle with various birds in the trees and quite large fish swimming around in the pond.Apart from the gardens, the whole area around the opera house is relaxing and the view of Sydney Harbour Bridge and the harbour itself is quite beautiful.

Very enjoyable.There are birds of an Aussie nature everywhere, park benches to rest, the botanical items were all labeled, a perfect set up. Walking from the gardens to the Opera House, we walked along the water for a bit and the house came into view. Perfect spot to take a selfie or have someone take your photo with the Opera House in the background.We walked completely around the Opera House and then, hit the crowds so the last 1/4 mile... sorry 400 meters, was hot and crowded.

The tickets aren't cheap, but how often would we be in Sydney over this festive season?We were able to walk through the Gardens after the show, a splendid garden filled with many unusual flowering plants, and a wedding in progress completed the picture.We were blessed with good weather, during our visit, but the Opera House would be fine in the rain, and the gardens just as pretty."

Being able to enjoy it from a variety of locations adds to the enjoyment, from the water, from close proximity and on the walk along the foreshore in the Botanic Gardens. The path is paved all along its length so it's easy for wheelchairs, buggies and those with limited mobility. Watch out for the joggers though! There are plenty of seats so you can rest whenever you feel like it - check for ants enjoying the seat too! The foreshore walk is flat closest to the Opera House and slopes slightly towards the opposite end. A brilliant place to watch the sunset, watch the reflections and ever changing light on the water of the Harbour and just to reflect. There are many specimen trees and flower beds in close proximity to the walk all helpfully labelled. The views across to Sydney Harbour Bridge are terrific too. If you want to explore more of the Botanic Gardens there is a land train that sets off from the gate near the opera House every 30 minutes. A great experience."

The walk from the Opera House to the Botanic Gardens is a level walk by the side of the harbour, it only takes about 10 minutes to walk there, and once at the gardens there are so many lovely flowers, trees and shrubs to see. Inside the gardens there is a gift shop and also a restaurant. The gardens are free to enter and there is a land train available for less mobile visitors and children, for which there is a small charge."

The views are even better if you walk up into the botanic gardens, but the coastal path is excellent.If you need a break there is plenty of shade in the garden.

If you're staying in the city it's an easy walk to the Quay or there is the Circle train line. The view of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House as you arrive at the Quay still excites me after living near Sydney for over 40 years. It's just an amazing sight! You may be lucky enough to see a cruise ship at the Overseas Terminal - Sydney is a huge cruise destination with many ships leaving and departing each week. The ferries to various Harbourside locations including the zoo, go from Circular Quay. If you plan on taking a tour of the Opera House you should book in advance online as occasionally you may not be able to get a tour on arrival. The promenade from Circular Quay is wide and passes numerous cafes and restaurants. It can be very hot so take a hat and make sure you have sunscreen. The promenade continues around the base of the Opera House and at the far end there's an area where seals like to come ashore on the steps. Continue around the base of the Opera House and you will end up at the Royal Boranic Garden gates. The walk continues around the harbour to Mrs Mcquarries Chair a headland in the east of the park. You can also head off into the central area of the gardens if you'd like a shorter walk. Maps are usually available in boxes throughout the gardens but it's easy enough to find your way around. There are great views of Sydney's skyline and harbour so make sure you have your camera. You can wander through many different types of gardens, take a break at the cafe or buy souvenirs or books at the Garden House. A colony of fruit bats resides in the central garden area so look out for them. There are several exits - one leads to the art gallery and others directly into the city so there are several options where your walk will end. Make sure you allow at least 2 hours - more if you have the time available, and enjoy the walk from Circular Quay to the Opera House and into the Botanic Gardens."

She used to sit there after creating it to enjoy the Harbour views - so they say and yes the view is very nice from here as well.From there continue along the waters edge to see Garden Island Navy area. If you are lucky you will see at least several Navy Ships. We saw the new LHD Helicopter landing ship The HMAS Canberra as it was named today. A magnificent ship built in Melbourne with work carried out by other states as well, like SA - for software/firmware delivery and installation. Something Australia can be proud of.Then when you get to the finger Wharf area, decide to go there for lunch or walk back into the Botanic Garden and enjoy walking through that once again. A couple of exhibits were under re-construction but we still enjoyed the walk through this lovely area. Well worth doing :-)"

After leaving our hotel I wandered through Hyde Park (with all its gorgeous fountains and flower beds) through the Botanical Gardens and then along the Harbour to The Opera House. Not only was this a highly relaxing walk - it was simply stunning as well. The view of the Harbour is obviously breathtaking, yet beauty for me is also in the small details. I loved seeing all the different flowering specimens in the Park and just loved laying on the grass looking up into the branches of a high Fig Tree. It is also a great place to sit and people watch - with tourists and locals enjoying gorgeous harbour. When it finally came into view, it literally took my break away - it is such an iconic building - the scale and detail of the building is something to awe at. There is lots of construction at the Opera House at the moment, but there are still some great photo opportunities, including panoramic views of the Harbour Bridge. Sydney, I love you.

We walked slowly through the Botanical gardens, stopping and admiring trees and vistas, browsing in the shop and finally emerging on to the harbour-side. We followed the path round to the left until the Opera House loomed into view, like a great ship floating at its mooring in the brilliant blue scene, surrounded by swirling sea birds in the air and swarming people on the ground. The gardens are beautiful and peaceful. The Opera House is equally beautiful and, of course, iconic and has always been thronged by sightseers whenever I have seen it. I recommend spending time in the gardens first, then rejoining the world for a cold drink beside the water, soaking in the spectacular scene of Bridge and the Opera and enjoying the contrast. You could always do it the other way round, though."

This walk is one of the joys of Sydney because you experience some of our beautiful harbourside parks and gardens as well as seeing the layout of the land much as it was when the colony began.Start at Circular Quay and walk around the Sydney Opera House. It was designed by Danish architect Joern Utzon, and later finished by Australian architect Peter Hall and others. It was completed in 1973. Then follow along the water's edge for about 1 kilometre until you come to Mrs Macquarie's Chair which was hand carved in the sandstone by convicts in 1810 for Governor Lachlan Macquarie's wife Elizabeth. Read the inscription and look towards the Sydney Harbour Heads, where Mrs Macquarie would sit each day and gaze out to sea waiting for her husband's ship to sail home around the point. Then you can walk another kilometre or so to the Art Gallery of NSW. You are following a foreshore which is the much the same shoreline as it was when Captain Arthur Phillip first landed here in 1788. In the distance of about one kilometre you will have seen what happened over about 160 years.On a sunny day you will see one of the great harbours of the world in all it s finery, with the sun glinting on the water. The old fort you can see to the North is Fort Dennison, built by convicts about around 1796 as a place to house any hapless convicts who broke the laws of the fledgling colony.By the time you round the point, the path takes you up from the water's edge to a spot much prized by tourists newlyweds to take photos with the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge both beautifully framed in the one shot. The Sydney Harbour Bridge (affectionately known by many Sydneysiders as \"the coat hanger\") was completed in 1932.You can either take a picnic lunch to enjoy anywhere sitting on the grass and watching ferries and ships bustling about on the harbour. Or you can stroll to an excellent restaurant opposite the Art Gallery of NSW, or another in the Botanic Gardens themselves."

This will allow you plenty of time for selfies with the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge as well as a bit of time to visit the Art gallery, library and government house building (all subject to opening times). This walk really is a combination of many attractions in one but is a good way to see all the tourist attractions people rave about in Sydney. The walk itself is pleasant and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and fitness levels."

Passing the Opera house, we got our needed \"selfies\" you need to have with your travel photos. The main aim was to see the Botanical Gardens. We started at the oldest trees in Sydney and went down the slope past huge fig trees, populated by a variety of birds. They did not worry about us and we were able to get some great photos. The various gardens were wonderful and mature. Great big examples of the plants made it great. Also, listening to the flocks of Cockatoo flying about made me positive that I will never own one. They are raucous. There are also sculptures scattered about that have some age to them. We had a cool, drizzly day, but it only served to intensify the colors. Great place for a walk."

I love this walk cause if you keep walking along the harbour on the edge of the garden you'll eventually after half an hour or so reach the art gallery. Then you can cut back through the gardens back to the opera house. Near one of the entrances to the botanical gardens that is in art gallery side you may get to see a hoard of cookatoo eating off the ground. Some off them will eat out of your hand. They are gorgeous cute and very vocal. It's an enjoyable experience. The gardens are lovely and you can always find a spot to have a nana nap"

You are provided with headsets that link to your tour guide and it is all extreme value for money by the end of your visit.Once you have been up through the House and seen where you are it is quite easy to work up the courage for a self guided tour back out throuhg the Botanical Gardens that spill right into Farm Cove.Really enjoy walking? This is for you.Be sure you walk far enough around to 'Mrs Macquarie's Chair' and maybe even have a swim at Boy Charlton Pool.............a 'saltie right on the harbour on the Wollomoloo side of the Gardens. (minmal surcharge to swim and sun)We dont have Disneyland's, or Six Flags, but we have natural beauty by the FREE tonne full...................if that sounds like you then what are you waiting for?"

The train could also be used to roam around, but it stops operating by around 5 pm in winters. For those who want to take classic pictures of Opera House in the background of Harbour Bridge and the sunset, make it to Mrs Macquarie's Chair, but you will need to walk about 15-20 minutes as the train stops operating well before the sunset"

The weather was very fine despite of a winter and we enjoyed the exquisite building of the Opera House, walking though the quiet Botanic Gardens with trees and birds which are unfamiliar to us and the fantastic view of the Opera House and Harbour bridge at Mrs. Macquarie's Point. I was impressed with the interesting rock which looks like a natural stage near Mrs. Macquarie's Point."

We arrived in Sydney quite early in the morning, and our hotel room was not to be ready until the early afternoon. We dropped off our luggage for safekeeping and found our way around Circular Quay, up to and around the Opera House and on to the Botanical Gardens. It was a gorgeous sunny day and we had a very pleasant walk with beautiful scenery. My 89 year old father accompanied hubby and I on this trip, and we had a wheelchair to use as he has difficulty walking long distances. We were glad to see the pathway in the Botanical garden was wheelchair friendly, although the slope of the path in places made for a strenuous push! The price was right (FREE!) and we spent a few hours just looking around! There was a train you could take (for a fee) but we chose to walk."

We had a full commentary about the plants and sculptures and would never have seen so much if we'd tried to walk it. It's a very worthwhile place to visit and is beautifully maintained and planned. You could spend a whole day there if the weather was good and would never be bored. The food is reasonably priced and beautifully prepared and the gift shop is not overpriced either, with lots of souvenirs and unusual items of interest. We were very please we went there.

The Fauna exhibit was closed for renovation which was disappointing. I then went back to the main road that led to the Opera House. This had nothing in particular to note apart from it felt like being in a freezing wind tunnel, the wind comes up from the Harbour and is funneled through the high rise buildings on the left and the rockc/cliff on the right. I'm sure that on a lovely warm day its a pleasant enough walk but nothing of any real note."

Water views abound while the gardens, although not as extensive or good as the Royal Botanic Gardens 900 kilometres south in South Yarra (Melbourne, Victoria) are nonetheless quite interesting.There was a poor amount of public (non cafe) seating but we found one. It had recently rained so a few sheets of newspaper came in handy.The native ibis (birds) got a bad writeup in a local paper that day as being aggressive and pests but I found them amusing. Even better was an acrobatic noisy miner (a smaller native bird) who continually swooped past my hand and was suitably rewarded with me throwing a bit of my roll (although bread is not good for native birds or animals as far as I know.)Seagulls and some pigeons were pests (non native) and ought not be fed anything.Unfortunately the Australian native garden near the entrance is closed as the soil is infected with a cinnamon fungus that causes dieback, but one could still view a bit of it.There were toilets near the Gardens cafe. The site is an easy walk from Circular Quay railway station."

This is a lovely walk starting from the city and making your way through the gardens and eventually down to the Opera House. They are doing a bit of work around the Opera House at the moment (May 2014) but you can skirt all around the back of the Opera House to avoid all that. Then walk on around to Circular Quay and then back through the city or up to Darling Harbour. Plenty of places to sit and rest such as benches. Some lovely elevated views of the Opera House and Bridge."

We started from the Art Gallery of NSW and walked through the Japanese Tea Gardens, which are stunningly manicured and a great contrast to looking over the water at the naval ships. Take the upper walk and see Mrs Macquarie's chair andround the corner to simply incredible views of Sydney Harbour. There are plent of places to take photos and none will disappoint. From here we walked through the botanic gardens and they are beautiful, but nothing beats that first sight of the harbour.There were lots of people jogging and it was quite busy but the walkway is wide and there are plenty of places to stop and have a picnic whilst enjoying watching the world go by.There is also a little 'train' (wheels not tracks) allowing those with children and the less mobile to enjoy the surroundings.We took a half day to do our walk, but this was from CBD, and included stopping for lunch overlooking the harbour, plus loads of photo stops. I'm sure you could allow a couple of hours and still havetime to properly appreciate all the sights. I'd highly recommend the full walk as the views as you round the corner of the harbour are breathtaking."

Look past the renovations around the Opera House and take in the harbour view, give yourself plenty of time to explore inside the Sydney Opera House, maybe take in a free tour, there is also a paid tour which is more indepth. Once you are finished there follow the path into the gardens.Once inside the gardens there are various paths to take, some following along side the harbour wall and the others taking you up past Government House but it doesnt matter which path you take as all are interesting. Follow the signs to the cafe and restaurant, food is good at both places and well priced. Behind the cafe is a gift shop which is well worth the visit. Find time to take in lunch before leaving the gardens and heading off to NSW Art Gallery.The Botanical Gardens are well sign posted and majority of the plants have name plates to assist you. The Gardens are divided into different \"themes\" and also contain the oldest bridge in Sydney as well."

This walk is wheel chair friendly except for getting up the steps to the entrance but if you're really keen to do this then there's a lift somewhere.Then we walk around the harbour wall in the Botanic Gardens all the way to Mrs. Macquarie's Chair as this gives you a great photo of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge together. We then walk back to the pond whilst getting great views of the harbour and the ferries. We usually stroll around the paths admiring the gardens then have lunch or refreshment at the cafe in the centre of the gardens. There's also a restaurant for those who need something more substantial.From there you can go back to Circular Quay or head south west to Macquarie Street and see all the old historic sandstone buildings."

The Opera House has many nooks and crannies to explore. The kids will love it and the memory will last a lifetime. After this you can indulge in a gastronomic delight at one of the many, many restaurant/cafes lining the foreshore. Then, it's time to walk off those calories so get on your walking shoes to visit the Botanic Gardens. This is a lovely way to spend an afternoon. Experience the tranquillity and serenity of nature at its best while drinking in the beautiful flora and fauna that the gardens have to offer. Maybe you can find a nice spot just to sit and possibly read a book or simply enjoy the calm as you gaze out across the harbour. A memorable day and a must to put on your 'to do' list."

There are many seagulls on this walk, so watch out above you! But in all seriousness, most of your staring will be done at the foliage of the gardens and of the shimmering harbour waters beside you. There are quite a few great walks in Sydney, but if you are short for time, then this one will probably suffice. An Opera House tour, this pleasant walk, topped off by tea in the Botanic Gardens restaurant, is a fantastic way to spend half a day!"

Because the gardens are free to enter, they are as much a park as formal gardens. There is a lovely Japanese garden as well as a rose garden; there are 19th century sculptures of AU founding fathers but also very wonderful modern and aborigine-based sculpture. The trees are simply magnificent and many are very unusual.If you are looking for lots of flowers, this may not be to your liking.

It is only a stones throw from the opera house to the botanical gardens - so I would not really call it a walk! the actual walk through the gardens is lovely and well worth the effort. This is where I first noticed the ibis, which are quite tame and behave a bit like pigeons and sparrows etc. in that they will come to your table at a cafe much like the other types."

On a fine day or even a not so fine day, the sights, sounds and smells of the harbour, the bridge, the SOH, through the Botanic Gardens to the Seat, is gentle, you can do it at your own pace, and then meander through the Gardens. My favourites are the Herb Garden, and the beautiful Rose Gardens, where my brother was married. Then grab a coffee at the Cafe in the Gardens, then turn right and tackle the hill to find the Art Gallery and Museum up on the ridge. A great way to spend a day in the City."

The walk from behind the Opera House out to Mrs. Macquarie's Seat looked an awfully long way in the heat and on tired legs after five days exploring Sydney, mostly on foot, but it was well worth it. I didn't do justice to the Botanic Gardens but they look a great place to picnic, have fun with the kids, or find a shady spot to read or admire the view or make friends with the inquisitive ibis who patrol the area. The coastal path is wide and someone must do a great clean-up job as it was remarkably litter-free considering the swarms of tourists who had the same idea as I. Vistas out to sea or back to the city are magnificent and there's plenty of artwork to admire, from the traditional to the ultra modern; enough to satisfy the most eclectic of tastes. Along with the water traffic, the open-air cinema, specimen trees and fellow travellers, there are plenty of distractions along the way. I even got to see a wedding ceremony taking place. Seats are placed at convenient intervals although most of them were already occupied. The area was originally laid out and landscaped along the lines of popular taste in Victorian England and it retains much of this old world charm. Personally I would have appreciated some identification labelling on the trees. Progress wasn't that fast due to the amount of visitors wanting their photo taken with the iconic landmarks of Sydney in the background as a memento of the day. At my destination there was a mobile food and drink van, strategically placed out of site over a rise, which served ice cold drinks and a more than passable toasted sandwich. If you want a photo of Mrs. Macquarie's seat without someone sitting on it, be prepared to wait until it's free. I have to wonder what Elizabeth Macquarie would make of her view today; I suspect she would be well satisfied."

For a precinct that is marketed as a world class attraction, the co-location of a hi-tech tented 'side show' adjacent to the Sydney Opera House is simply hard to believe. And walking through into the RBG which is now a construction site along the foreshore, overseas visitors must be wondering what is so special about this location. As a local, I was embarrassed, and left wondering what impressions were left for overseas visitors to Australia."

We once did it from Woolloomooloo to the Opera House when we were due at the opera and we arrived out of breath after the gate was locked. Fortunately work was going on at the side and a quick dash up into the Domain and out a side gate got us to the opera just on time. That was some years ago and I see some changes at the gates that may allow late walkers egress! We walked in the opposite direction this time and through the Botanics to Woolloomooloo and it was wonderful The harbour sights are always fascinating and some (though not all....) of the joggers add to the beauty of the scenery so it is worth a dawdle to take all this in."

We took a tour and learned first hand about the various sections of the Opera House and what transpires in each area. Then we watched a magnificent play afterward. A wide selecton of performances are offered throughout the year. It is a must see if one is in Sydney. The circular quay walk is a pleasant walk and well worth doing."

We went there in between time before our show starts in the evening, quite a nice view and a few attractions to notice in the Botanics Garden. One thing to note is the gate for the garden closes quite early though, they shuts off at around 5.30pm, so do go there a little earlier, I think once you are in, you are able to stay in there a little after the gate closing time, the exit gate should be open all the time, just that the gate to enter has a time limit (we didn't try though, so.. no guarantee =P, well we didn't see any staff of management the whole time there)"

While waiting for that tour, we went over to the Botanic Gardens, and were fortunate to catch the last tram at 4.30pm. It was a wonderful value for money ride, as given the short time we have before the opera house tour started, we managed to have a very comfortable ride through the beautiful grounds of Botanic Gardens, without working up a sweat. Having three children with us means we would not be able to walk long or far, so the tram was just nice for us, to savour the cool wind, as well as to enjoy the scenic landscape of both the gardens as well as the harbour area. My children absoulutely loved it. I would strongly recommend the tram ride for families with young children. If time allows, you can always get off at various stops to enjoy the garden. Last tram leaves at 4.30 though. For us, it was a great two in one fun, given that we only reached the area at 4.10pm. After the tram, we were just in time to go for our tour at the Opera House, which itself is a architectural beauty."

You continue on and see where Queen Elizabeth first set foot on Australian soil, following this beautiful walk takes you by the sea wall to the foot of The Royal Botanic Gardens. These are always a pleasure to explore with various displays and exhibitions. Refreshments are also available.Finally resting at Lady Macquarie's chair, a bench like carving that was provided so Mrs Macquarie could reflect by the harbour when her husband governed a young colony. The view of the Opera House and Harbour bridge from her is unsurpassable. There is an observation deck where you can get that fantastic photo of these two icons. There is also refreshments available and some tables and chairs to rest at while enjoying this fabulous view.Of course there is more to see from this point too. You can look down the harbour towards Taronga Park Zoo and directly across at Admiralty House and Kirribilli House.It's only a 3 kilometre stroll, you can do it at your own pace and take in some of the most beautiful scenery Sydney has to offer.

We were a little disappointed that the trail next to the Harbor was under construction, but that was only a minor disappointment. The trees are unbelievable and I loved that the park felt so informal."

This wasn't my first visit to Sydney, but it was my first trip purely for leisure and staying at the Shangri La meant the walk started long before we left the hotel.The weather decided to contribute and we were gifted with a clear sunny crisp Saturday morning, with the ferry's doing brisk service and a fleet of sails behind the Opera House to make a picture perfect horizon. The walk itself is easy and level most of the way, but for anyone with less puff a stop at one of the many bistros or restaurants provides a refreshing breather. One criticism however, the Opera Kitchen on the lower level of the Opera House is one to miss. The food is uninspiring at best and there is no shade on the upper area, the table without a view did nothing to offset the dismal atmosphere. However onwards to the gardens and Ohh was it worth it! The tree embalmed elevated lookout to the bridge and bustle left us breathless. A veritable oasis for one to watch the world go by. It is easy to see why people flock to Sydney on days like this..."

The path from here is not completely obvious but there are steps that lead up to a harbourside Olympic Pool. The path follows the cliff around passed Mrs Mac's chair and around the headland to reveal one of the most spectacular views in the World. The stunning harbour in all its glory, with the Opera House and Harbour Bridge all \"in frame\". The path is bordered by the beautiful Botannical Gardens on one side and the Harbour on the other.

After boarding, I had a whole afternoon ahead of me before the ship was to leave. So on the advice of my daughter the RCCL shore excursions mgr I decided to visit the Sydney Opera House. What a work of art. Every curve, every concept put into this magnificent building was awe inspiring. This is truly a jewel that can be enjoyed by all ages and that still has more possibilities to be realized before they are finished with the original dream started many years ago. At the doorsteps of this monumental building is the Sydney botanical gardens, where I sauntered for the next couple of hours on my way back to the ship. It is always so educational to explore different cultures and Australia has some trees and fauna not to be found elsewhere. After the cruise in the South Pacific islands before embarking on one of the coast of Australia I was lucky enough to spend another in Sydney this time exploring the city with a friend in a walking tour discovering it's history. What a memorable experience!!!"

Harbour on one side and garden on the other side. It can be quite packed with the locals doing their commuting on this path and aswell people use it for jogging track.. But don't worry it is still a wide walking path designed for everyone. I myself really enjoyed the walk with my two toddlers on their strollers."

There are many restaurants and cafes where the food and coffee are excellent and on a Saturday night and some Sundays there is live music. The walk from the ferry quay or from the city itself is an easy walk. There are plaques in the footpath to tell you a little bit about the history of Sydney. On the opposite side of the bay there is also the overseas terminal and the park next to this is 'First Fleet Park' which is an area commemorating the landing of our First Fleet settlers in 1788. Here also is Cadman's Cottage one of the few original buildings. The walk to the Botanical Gardens is again very easy and the gardens are beautiful.

The weather was perfect, which certainly helped make the walk so enjoyable. But the view of the Bridge and Opera House from Mrs Macquaries Chair, which was at the halfway mark, was a real highlight. It wasn't a difficult walk, and could certainly be undertaken by someone with a pram, young children or older people. My only regret was that we did the walk a bit too early in the day, as we didn't feel like eating one of the famous pies at 'Harry's', despite the fact that they looked amazing. My only advice is make sure you have a plan once you reach Woolloomooloo, as we were at a bit of a loss as to what we should do after we arrived."

I was highly impressed with the views, the walk itself and the connection that was provided to the Sydney Harbour, the Opera House, The Rocks, and many other places and attractions. The weather was perfect for the walk and it was incredibly relaxing considering the hectic week that had preceded. This would be a great walk with family and I would highly encourage taking the time while you are in the area."

The auditoriums are large, spacious and worth looking. After visiting Opera House, we visited Royal Botanic Garden which is nearby. It is most relaxing walk. Greenary, Sydney skyline, Opera House and Harbour Bridge are seen very photogenic from this garden. We spend whole evening at Opera House and Royal Botanic Garden. Must visit."

On our second visit to Sydney we walked to the gardens twice to escape the busy, noisy city centre. We took a takeout and lunched on one of the benches looking out to the harbour view. Lots of joggers about at lunchtime so be careful not to get run down! Just step away onto the grass and find your spot under one of the many amazing trees. Loved this walk and believe its a must do on every trip to Sydney."

The walk from the Sydney Opera House through the Botanical Gardens and onwards to Mrs Macquarie's Chair and Wolloomooloo Bay is one of the classis Sydney walks on a sunny day. The Botanical Gardens sits on Farm Cove which was landing place for the First Fleet into Sydney Town. The name Farm Cove was given because it was the location of the farms needed to grow food for the new settlers from England circa 1778. The gardens are beautiful and the walk around the cove to Mrs Macquarie's chair is memorable. On the eastern side of the walk you will see a brass plaque on the walkway. The plaque denotes the location where Queen Elizabeth II first set foot on Australian soil.

After the bridge and the Rocks we made our way back to Circular Quay and walked along the promenade alongside the Opera House. Having looked across at the Opera House from Sydney Harbour Bridge we then enjoyed the view of the bridge from the Opera House - quite fantastic. A leisurely stroll brings you around the building giving you some close-up views of the structure. On the other side there are nice panoramas across the harbour and round into the inlet forming the boundary of the Botanical Gardens. We just walked through the gardens but it was obvious that you could spend quite a long time there as evidenced by the many people who had obviously spent most of their day there. Our stamina was beginning to run down by then but it was still an enjoyable and interesting stroll through these beautifully maintained gardens."

The pristine Royal Botanical Gardens are generally unknown to overseas tourists before they arrive, but most will discover the gardens thru their quest to see the adjacent Sydney Opera House. Free admission and lots of shade on a hot day.Supposedly a specimen of every plant species in the world is here. Don't miss the herb garden and the cactus garden, which are hidden away. Many city office workers come here lunch. It's a favourite place of the whole city. Search for Lady Macquarie's chair - it's on the eastern edge of the Gardens at the point underneath the cul de sac (near the Conservatory of Music) where the tourist buses stop to take pictures. Lady Macquarie's Point was where Lady Elizabeth Macquarie, the wife of Governor Lachlan Macquarie, would sit and watch boats coming into the harbor, and the sweeping views. The historic \"chair\" was carved out of a rock ledge for her, no doubt by convict labor. People liked Governor Macquarie much better than Governor Bligh - yes the same Captain Bligh from Mutiny on the Bounty. After Bligh was unceremoniously booted off his ship by a crew sick of his extreme and heavy-handed ways, he eventually made it back to England where he was appointed an early Governor of the State of New South Wales. What the hell were they thinking? Previously, Bligh had caused trouble on the discovery ship of Captain James Cook (the Endeavor, I believe) who charted the east coast of Australia and the west coast of North America. The book entitled: The Return of Lono: A Novel of Captain Cook's Last Voyage (by O.A. Bushnell) is an excellent account of Cook's last visit to Hawaii where he was clubbed to death in the surf at Kona over a stolen rowboat. The novel is a weaving of fact and fiction. Yes, sports fans, the roots from England and the beginnings of modern Australia and the United States all fits together. My apologies to the natives who were there first, but you know what I mean.I remember back in my high school days a friend and I once snuck into the Gardens at night after closing. Though Australia is still an innocent country in many ways, removed from a lot of the world's troubles, I probably wouldn't recommend such a nocturnal adventure nowadays. The kids of today are missing out on so much fun and innocent mischief due to the security concerns of recent times, even though many of them think they know it all. Remember the time when you could walk up to the gate at the airport to see off your friends boarding their plane?"

Started this walk as a bit of a look see when on the steps of the opera house as they are building the new access road to the opera house and have constructed a set of steps as a walk over to the entrance of the gardens.Once inside we kept strolling and taking it all in, seems a very popular place to jog through by workers on their lunch break and some playing musical instruments in quiet spots among the trees or a nap in the shade or eat some lunch on a bench under a magnolia tree in flower like we did.The plants and trees are mostly labled as to their species and where they originated which is great as it builds ones knowledge. Any way we kept on walking and came accross a cafe which had a number of shaded tables outside so couldn't resist having a coffee with the Ibis birds waiting for tit bits. So a lovely afternoon spent among the plants trees and birds in a magnificent location overlooking the Opera House and Harbour and came away with loads of pictures.ps if you've got kids there is a smashing train ride they can take which takes the path along the edgeof the harbour!!"

We are blessed living just down the road from these great icons!Most mornings we get up early enough to catch either the moon disappearing behind a cruise ship at CQ (this is a MUST SEE in late March early April) or see the sun rising at the end of the harbour.Even though the Opera House fore court has been in building mode for a while, there is nothing more impressive then to see the big cruise ships coming into the harbour between 530-6am during the cruising season.As they turn around right in front of the Opera House and back into the CQ mooring, it is like free open air theatre. We are always surprised why we are the only ones there to see it......Very much worth the early morning rise during the cruising season!The walk back through the Botanic gardens at that time is not possible because the gardens do not open until 7am however the walk through the Domain or past the Cathedral and water gardens above the Cook & Phillip pool are also worth while.As I said, we are blessed living at Coppertop Cottage and being able to do this every morning. We try and encourage our guests to come with us in the morning on a nice day (YES, it is an early rise........."

(they sleep all day anyway)."

For people who love photography, this place will give you loads of objects to capture! The last time I went there, i tried something different.. I did an early morning run from Mrs Macquarie's Point to Sydney Harbour's port. Love the feeling of breathing in fresh morning breeze and smell of the ocean..One of my favorite spot in Sydney!"

The Opera House interior was spectacular; what a pleasure to see the play, 'South Pacific'. Have a pre-theater dinner on the outside patio with a view of the Harbour Bridge and all of Sydney Harbour. The Royal Botanic Gardens walk on a beautiful September day provided us with views of the seldom-seen back side of the Opera House. Walk all the way over to Mrs. Macquarie's Chair, then head back toward the Opera House and you'll see great photo opportunities (see my photos). The interior of the Gardens was lovely and well worth a visit. If you take a ferry to Manly Beach or a whale-watching cruise, you will pass by all the beauty of the Opera House on the water, and the Gardens walk, so go back another day and walk it. Highly recommended."

There is a large lake nearby in the botanic gardens where you might be able to view birds seagulls, ibises, waterhen, occasionally swans or sulpher crested cockatoos etc. Bats (flying foxes) roost in some of the nearby trees during the day, and take flight at dusk making a wonderful sight. Best to view them at a safe distance though as they may carry a virus that can be transferred to humans if they scratch or bite you. There's a kiosk and restaurant in the Botanic Gardens. Kiosk is shabby, restaurant is overpriced in my opinion. The Botanic gardens Giftshop is well worth a look though, as they usually stock an interesting range of giftware, and were stocking \"bush tucker\" native Australian jams such as lilli pilli jam and native lime marmalade. Deliscious! A bronze statue of a mare guarding her foal along the foreshore walk is one of my favourite pieces of art in this city."

Around the opera house is obviously a very busy area, but you are quickly through the crowds and up over the scaffolding bridge. Once you get to the botanics there is a higher path, or lower path close to the water, and you can do a loop around the whole gardens. There is a map just as you enter the gardens, with printed maps for you to take around so take a look and see what takes your fancy. We were told by friends who had been before that during the day you can see all the fruit bats sleeping in the trees, but after looking up every tree we could find we couldn't see any, when we asked a gardener we were told that every day during the early hours people go down and make lots of noise to scare the bats away as they were damaging the trees! It's a shame really as I would have liked to see them! However we did see them all at night flying over centennial park when we were at the moonlight cinema which was amazing!"

HOwever, the gates to the gardens don't open before 7am so early morning walkers can't enjoy this walk, only can be done during the day. For any traveller to Sydney it is a must and if you live in Sydney, its a great way to unwind and enjoy the beautiful sights of Sydney and the botanical gardens - away from downtown. It only a relatively short walk from downtown and you can walk through the gardens entering at Macquarie Street to join this walk. Would highly recommend any person living in or visiting Sydney to enjoy this walk. The Opera House area is undergoing some renovations at present, but due to be finalised by mid year 2013. Still able to access the walk around the Opera House, just a bit of an eye saw at construction site. Don't let that put you off!"

The Opera House has a marvellous home made 'ice pop' stall (flavours such as banana, lime and roast coconut, or lemon, cucumber and mint) which is almost worth the walk in itself. The Opera House could do with more info. plaques: it has an interesting history, including the original competition for the design."

The gate at the top of the gardens leads almost straight to NSW Art Gallery with its interesting collection in a lovely building. I joined a guided tour at 2.00 pm which took us through the best of the Australian paintings. A witty informative commentary gave me a much better understanding of Australian art."

We started walking north through Hyde Park and visited the Anzac War Memorial and after walking around the gaudy Archibald Fountain we crossed over the road to the Art Gallery Rd and visited the Art Gallery of NSW. Then we followed the road to Mrs Macquaries Rd and we walked around counter clockwise (went down to the outer path nearest the water for most of it but headed up to see \"the chair\" and also a great lookout back to the Opera House). Then we walked back to the Botanical Gardens. These were generally lovely park areas surrounding a middle garden. We stopped for lunch here at the cafe. After walking around the park areas and realising that the Palace Gardens were a general area (not specifically a garden) we headed back to the waterfront and continued west towards the Opera House so that we had great views as we approached. After climbing the many stairs at the Opera House and looking around we finished off our walk with a chilled (alcoholic) beverage at the Opera House Cafe.

A beautiful walk from the Opera House along the waters edge through to Mrs Macquarie's Chair and on to Wooloomooloo (just keep the water on your left all the time). To return, look for the pedestrian bridge back towards the 'giant matchsticks' sculpture and the Art Gallery Of NSW which is worth a quick or slow look...it's free.Alternatively, from Wooloomooloo, after stopping at Harry's Cafe De Wheels, walk up to the boho area of Potts Point and get a train back from Kings Cross."

It stops in 4 places so you can get on and off when you want. The Herb Garden was very pretty and there are some wonderful sculptures around as well as all the flowers and trees. The train driver gives a commentary and points out plants and trees of interest and gave us a lot of historical information.

The fruit bats are far fewer these days and visitors can still get a thrill and occasionally a shock to see these furry creatures hanging around in the day before taking flight at dusk.When you reach the water turn left and follow the path along to the Opera House for views missing from most post cards and along to Circular Key, the Museum of Art and the rocks for great pubs and eating."

Both nestled in Sydney Harbor near the water taxi/ferr bay and along the bus route, you can find lots of great restaurants to enjoy; wonderful little shops. And when you enter the Gardens, you may be tempted to climb the nearest Jackson Fig, but refrain from doing so. Although ifd you do slip up, the grounds-people are very nice about it."

I would recommend that you start from Circular Quay, heading towards the Sydney Opera House, where you can spend an hour or so touring it. Just five minutes' walk along the shore, you will reach the Royal Botanic Gardens, a lush and vast park where they invite you to walk on the grass. It is filled with many species of plants and herbs. Stop by the central lake where you can see birdlife as well as eels swimming along. Better yet, bring some food and wine and have a picnic. A lovely way to spend a spring morning"

Walk around...take your time... close to the river, more in the garden.When i was there there were so many parrots of all sorts and birds.Crumble up some bread you got from the market and see how they all come to you... at one point i had more that 4 Kakatoo on me sitting... and birds all over.Take your time to just relax.

For me, the real highlight of this pathway is the sunset. From here you can watch the sky come alight behind the CBD skyline, the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge. An excellent vantage point for photographs. Expect to see wedding parties taking photos on the pathway in the afternoon.  An excellent part of Sydney and highly recommended."

There is also good access to many parts of the city via the garden gates on the city side as well as Woolloomooloo on the opposite side.If you are looking to do some exercise then head down on a week day lunch as there are hundreds of people training which can provide some extra motivation if you don't mind sharing a path."

However, I visited Australia with a taste for adventure. If you are short on time, skip this walk and head to the mountains or outback for abseiling, four wheel driving and other adventures. The gardens are lovely, but not necessarily unique. There are countless scenic walks in Sydney. This is not the best."

The gardens are also a great escape to detach yourself from the suffocating tourist blob that just sticks mainly to the Opera House. The best experience of the Opera House is of course if you actually go and enjoy one of the plays. Best bucks for your money! Avoid all other costly tourist traps."

After coming into the harbour by ferry, we followed the Writers Walk, a 50 person bronze plaque trail along the harbourfront, including plaques for Robert Louis Stevenson and Jack London, took pictures of the iconic Sydney Opera House, and then entered into the Royal Botanic Gardens, an amazing park stretching out along the water. The Botanic Gardens, established in 1816 and home to over 17,000 plant species, has, for us, really fascinating flora and fauna; almost every creature and plant we saw was one we don\u2019t have at home in Canada. Funny Ibis birds with long curved beaks, noisy mynah birds (cheeky beggars), red-beaked ducks with tiny babies (it was Spring there when we visited), and other interesting varieties of birds captured our attention, as did the trees full of Flying Foxes, an indigenous variety of large fruit bat. These creatures have colonised several trees in the park, from which the wardens are trying to remove them, with little luck, as far as I can tell. The Mynah birds have incredibly sentient faces. There are a couple of venues for art exhibitions in the Gardens and we were lucky enough to be able to check out the Artisans in the Garden art exhibition at the Lions Gate Pavilion in the Gardens, an interesting show of sculpture, pottery, jewellery, and ceramic art in a garden setting. We then wandered through the fern pavilion, in which beautiful varieties of tree fern were displayed \u2013 these are really amazing \u2013 and the Palace Gardens, whose sculpture reminded me very much of the Boboli Gardens in Florence. This walk is highly recommended. See more info and lots of pictures here: http://lmaclean.ca/2011/10/a-ferryboat-ride-and-a-stroll-through-the-gardens-sydney/"

The best views on the walk are available from this vantage."

Beautiful day, I walked from the Four Seasons, at the SW corner of Circular Quay, to the Opera House, and back south to enter the Botanical Garden close to the Circular Memory sculpture garden. Toured the grounds of Government House, and then went down to the water. Walked around to MacQuarie Point and Mrs. MacQuarie's Chair. I loved every minute. Something like NY Central Park on a beautiful October Sunday, by the water."

Whenever I was stress or boring, I would take a train/bus to circular quay and walk from opera house to the botanic gardens. I really enjoyed the walk. The harbour view was fantastic. Although it might be a little bit too long for some people, you will appreciate the great view along the way and very excited to reach Mrs. Macquarie point, where you can discover the best spot to take a photo with the opera house and harbour bridge. Sometimes, I had the walks with my friends. We love to stop a while, sit on the grass, eat some snacks and chit chat while enjoying the great view, it's so relaxing. If I had a chance to go back to Sydney again, I will definitely take this walk again."

            "review": "May 2012. My husband and I found this walk by accident. We walked around the Sydney Opera House (taking pictures of the front) and saw the pathway. I told him we'd probably get really good pictures of us, with the Sydney Opera House and Bridge from the path, and I was absolutely correct. We didn't even know we were entering the Botanic Gardens (ok, we are one of those couples who travels and does some research, but we like to find out most things once we get there so we didn't even know about this walkway) and it was a nice surprise to see such nice, landscaped areas to walk while we enjoyed the Sydney Harbour views.Once we reached the end of the pathway (which is outside the Botanic Garden's property), we realized we had reached a point where lots of tourist groups bring their guests because there were at least 100 people posing for pics with the Sydney Opera House and Bridge behind them, but honestly, I thought we took better pictures along the walkway. While we were there, at least five buses came and dropped off visitors, so we didn't stay long.Oh! Another neat sight along the way is a sandstone wall with steps carved into them that you can take pictures in. Very unique.Suggestion: Once you reach the end of the walkway; go back! We tried to walk towards what we assumed would be the road and public transportation and we walked for an hour before we came into \"civilization\". Yes it was all paved, but there wasn't much to see. In hindsight, we would have just walked back along the path towards the Sydney Opera House and Harbour because it was just as far as we walked trying to find a bus.Bring water. There isn't any place to buy anything along the walk. There are bathrooms along the way (although they aren't right on the path; you'll have to do some walking) and it is quite a distance, so wear comfortable shoes and clothing."

Maybe strolling is bst to fully drink in the loveliness of the the Opera House the harbour the bridge behind and the Botaniccal ardens in front of you. TIP - Expect crowds at all the usual times so if a peaceful walk is what you are after then time it accordingly. Also consider going right around to Lady Maquaries Chair and if you are feeling in the mood maybe a dip at the Boy Charlton pool or enjoy time in the Art Gallery of NSWonly a short walk further around."

Maybe 150-200? I saved about 10 of them as great memories. The building is just begging to be photographed. The adjacent Botanic Gardens are missed by most visitors and definitely worth a visit. We were there in February and visiting the Botanic Gardens at dusk will give you access to something you don't see every day--bats. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of bats. They like a particular type of tree (not sure of the species) of which there are several in the Botanic Gardens."

Lots of viewing points and benches. There is also a little \"train\" if you are not a good walker. Within the botanic gardens themselves there are various specialist areas and also a cafe for light lunches and refreshments. If you continue walking all along the foreshore you will pass a pretty swiming pool (Andrew Boy Charlton) right on the foreshore so you can have a cooling dip or stop at the very pretty cafe here. If you continue walking to the end there is another cafe/restaurant here but it does get very busy. Just across the road from here is the Art Gallery of NSW - there is a very nice reasonably priced cafe here with an outside area, on the Lower Ground Floor - a good place for a break after your walk.

This walk is not only to see Sydney's amazing sites like the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, it leads you around the harbour with the clear water on your left side and the beautiful botannical gardens to your right. It is a very convenient park, just adjacent to the city and has plenty of space and grass to play around on and an element of australian bush near the end. Great place to spend some time."

And when you approach it, you actually feel like you're walking towards a port, maybe a hundred years ago, in the golden age of seafaring. You get to Circular Quay and then walk to your right, passing by the Ferry piers and thru different shops and restaurants until you get to the promenade where the Opera House stands. Take pictures as you approach it. Walk around it. And get a drink in the bar, watching the harbour and the Bridge. After a while there, you can get inside for a quick visit. If you're lucky and there's a performance of your interest you may stay as well. Once you leave the Opera House, there's a lovely park adjacent to it: the Botanic Gardens. A very tranquil and relaxing spot that offers more beautiful views of Sydney Harbour."

Workers come out here daily in their lunchtime to catch up on their regular jog, even in the summer months! Move further up among the trees and you will see birds of all colours sitting in the branches, especial white Parakeets, something one doesn't see here in UK. Even further on up you will find a self service open air cafeteria where you will probably be surrounded by even more birds, especially the odd tall legged and long curved beaked Ibis I think it is called. I had one \"steal\" my ice cream, so beware! There are many gardens within the Gardens where you can just sit and rest and enjoy the surroundings. Another must see. (visits prior to 2011)"

The Opera house to the Botanic Gardens Walk is a must do on any Sydney visit, especially if you are only in town for a couple of days, You will get a fanastic view of the harbour bridge, the opera house, and the harbour. The gardens are stunning,with a tranquil lake down towards the harbour. If you have time you could easily roam around for a couple of hours discovering the different themed gardens, restaurant and shop."

The guide was excellent, and the tour was what we expected. They took our photo when we first arrived, and at the end we purchased it in a portfolio that superimposed us in front of and inside the opera house, as well as a CD on the Opera House, which we haven't watched yet (No photos are allowed inside the Opera House). There were also some postcards with our picture, which we promptly mailed away to family in hopes they would arrive home before we did! The one thing I wish we would have known was that you can purchase performance tickets for the next day's show(s) at $50pp by showing your tour ticket. Unfortunately, we bought our tickets online before we left and paid $155pp. It would be worth it to take the tour every time you go to Sydney, if you want to attend a performance."

On Friday and weekend, the rock market is there on it's alley, tons of different suvinior and artisan. Walk along the Sydney Cove With the view of Opera House. Pass the Circular Quay to Operahouse. So many good ambient restaurants along the way.Opera House - Botanic Garden: a gorgeous greeny walk with a view of ferries, yatches, boats in a beautiful habour. You can stop by the government house. If you love roses, don't miss the Palace garden.Botanic Garden - Mrs Mcquarie's Point: Walk along the Farm Cove to Mrs Mcquarie's point. If you were there at dusk, watch the sunset behind the Opera House and Habour Bridge from the end of the peninsula. This point is popular spot for tourist to take a photo with opera house.Mrs Mcquarie's Point - Art Gallery of NSW: Walk east, pass Mrs Mcquarie's Chair, keep left into small walking track. The track will lead you to another side of the peninsula along the Wooloomooloo Bay. The track is peacefully laid along the water but still very greeny from the cliff with a view of Wooloomooloo Wharf and a navy base. It might be wet when high tide. You will pass swimming pool then get back to Mrs Mcquarie Rd. Walk straight to the Art Gallery of NSW.Art Gallery of NSW - St. Mary's Cathedral - Hyde Park - CBD: walking back to the city. You can stop by the gallery, cathedral and participate a seasonal event at Hyde Park. Across the Hyde Park is the shopping area or you can visit the Sydney tower for city sky view.All these might take a whole HAPPY DAY to finish but you will touch the real Sydney."

If you are a super walker and happy to walk even longer, the ideal walk would be from Museum or St James train station through Hyde Park and continue in a straight line past Sydney Hospital (beautiful sandstone buildings), the State Library, past the Conservatorium of Music, to the Botanical Gardens to the Opera House and around Circular Quay. I would probably allow most of a day to do this walk and include lunch along the way and enjoy the scenery, though, depending on the pace, some people do this run in their lunch break. There is lots to see, in the first section of Hyde Park you will see parts of Kings Cross (East) and the shopping district (West). Once you have passed Hyde Park, Pitt Street Mall is West and has many shops and places to eat. Sydney Hospital and the State Library is near Martin Place and is more luxury shopping (think Tiffany's, Burberry etc.) and a business area. The Con is East if you continue in a straight line along Elizabeth Street and is quite unusual looking, as it resembles a castle which leads into the Botanical Gardens. Once at the Opera house, there is uninterrupted views of the harbour which is lovely and many of the ferries and boats can be seen from here. If you walk back along Circular Quay towards the train station, you can see the Harbour Bridge, Luna Park there are high quality, expensive eateries along this area also. Highly recommended for tourists who want to see a little bit of everything."

Bear in mind that there are some steep bits to the walk up to the Gardens and also in the Gardens themselves. However, there are plenty of benches and viewing spots to stop and rest along the way, so this walk is suited to most levels of fitness. DO take a bottle of water if it's hot, because there's not much shade til you get to the Gardens. Also, plan to spend at least an hour in the Gardens themselves, because there's a lot to see!"

I loved wandering around the Botanic Gardens. Kids and hubby tolerated for mum's pleasure although they did kinda enjoy having a photo at Mrs Macquarie's chair."
