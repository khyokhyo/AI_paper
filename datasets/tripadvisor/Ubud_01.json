Ketut was really a nice guy, he showed us all typical things to see about Bali (Restaurant, Coffee break, Sate,...) and explained us all we wanted to know and more than that with a good English. Ketut has a good knowledge of the island, he used a lot of shortcut to avoid traffic. He had some really nice ideas for planning our tours day after day and see more than we wanted.Ask Putu to get Ketut as driver and you will enjoy Bali like us :D."

I came across Putu's service on Trip Advisor when searching for someone to take myself and my partner on a day trip to temples and waterfalls around Ubud. Putu had great reviews so I contacted him. His communication was fantastic, he was quick to respond and answered all my questions. Putu was unavailable on the day we wanted, but he advised me that Nyoman was free instead. I am so glad we had Nyoman for the day, he was fantastic!!! He picked us up from our resort near Ubud and took us to all the best temples and gave us advise on how not to get scammed, which was a huge help. He then took us to a fantastic place to have a buffet lunch overlooking the rice fields (we shouted him lunch for his excellent service) it was absolutely beautiful. Then on to Tegenungan Waterfall where we spent a couple of hours swimming, whilst Nyoman waited patiently in the car. Nyoman was great to chat to in the car and gave us lots of great history on Bali that was extremely informative. We can't fault his service at all, and we are so glad we booked with him. As we also needed to get from Ubud to airport two days latter, we hired him to take us. He was promptly waiting for us at the front of our resort and helped us with all our luggage and again at the airport. Such a lovely person, and we will definitely be booking his service again the next time we are in Bali. Thank you so much Nyoman!"

Price was on par with other companies but what you really pay for here is the except driving service and their knowledge of the area and history. Ketut's English was very good and easy to understand. He was very prompt mtg at the hotel in the morning. The itinerary I had in mind was a guideline of what we wanted to do, but Ketut was very flexible in adding/removing things to the itinerary. His driving was very good and not scary despite the craziness of the Bali roads. Ketut joined us touring the different sites and was able to provide some info about the history and help us take pictures. Definitely recommend their services!"

The time flew by as he took the time to discuss the ins and outs of Bali ceremonies and customs, family life and also gave us detailed information about the places we were going. We went up to the Sekumpul waterfalls - he personally walked us to the trailhead to make sure we didn't get lost getting there - a good 30 minute hike in the heat and humidity! He is so easy to talk to and genuinely wants you to have a good time. We went up to Pura Ulun Danu Bratan - Putu had the foresight to suggest we stop there first, to avoid the hoards of tourist buses - when we first got there, we were pretty much alone (us and maybe only 10 other tourists) - when we passed by there later the parking lot was full of buses. So glad we happened to find Putu on Trip Advisor. I highly recommend booking him and booking ahead. I hope to return to Bali soon, and when we do, we'll be calling Putu!"

Very comfortable air conditioned people mover that seats 6 or 4 with a lot of suitcases for airport transfers. We advise to book well ahead of your visit as he is very popular. Well done Putu!

We discussed prior to arriving in Bali and on the day itself where to visit. Putu was great in providing different options and we settled on Tanah Lot, the Monkey Forest, Rice Fields and the Terraces. The tour took over just about 10 hours (including Bali traffic). THE HIGHLIGHT of the day was the walk through rice fields, all on our own. He dropped us off at one end, and as we followed a well-set path along the fields, he picked us up on the other side. This was by far the best as it was off the beaten track and definitely not on the regular 'tour list'. Putu was also not only punctual but he was the most patient person (even when we took longer than we should). He was always concerned for our safety as well. We had a blast and would highly recommend Putu to lone & group travelers alike!"

Ketut is a wonderful person, passionate about his culture and religion, always in time and felt us feel safe throughout the 7 days. We had an itinerary but Ketut made it better, including other interesting things too, making our days full. He took us to the best restaurants, got us the best offers (e.g. Gili Air trip), he even recovered my slippers that were stolen and took in the jungle by the monkeys at Uluwatu! After we had arrived in Gili Air he texted me on whatsapp to make sure we are fine. We really created a bond with him, Ketut being more than a driver; we laughed a lot and he answered with a smile on his face to all our questions about Bali and hinduism. Ketut is now our friend. Don't hesitate to contact Putu Driver in Bali and ask for Ketut if you plan a vacation in Bali. Thank you for everything!"

If you told him to be at 8:00am at your hotel,he will be there at 7:45:) Ketut was for us an amazing driver,a good guide and a hell of a traditional story teller.The best choice for travelling in Bali is with a driver and with the hand on my heart i tell you that Putu or Ketut are the best! Take care guys and continue with what you're doing because their not so many drivers in Bali who do this with passion and commitment! PS: don't think to rent a car by yourself in Bali because the traffic is a chaos and you need a driver with experience!"

He drove us from sanur to ubud (including waterfall, monkey sanctuary, rice terrace etc). We were so happy and excited with him that we booked him for the day after to visit Mt. Batur vulcano (where he also organized us a sherpa). He also helped us to get speed boat Tickets to the gilis. Because we were late and all shops were closed, he met up with us in kuta (in his spare time!!!) to get us tickets and information. After we had arrived on gilis he texted me on whatsapp if we're fine and if everything worked well.

It was our first time in Bali and we're glad we had a local to drive us around. Kutu, was an awesome guy he's very nice, speaks good english, and has a lot of knowledge of Bali. We had a pretty good list of things to do and see and Kutu helped us organized the days we should tackle our list. He also made some amazing recommendations and I'm glad he did. For an example, in Ubud we were able to do a free coffee/tea tasting, took us to some nice beaches like Padang Padang, and you must ask him about the seafood restaurant in Jimbaran. He worked with your schedule and he was always on time. The price was very reasonable and the company is very trustworthy. I highly recommend booking with Putu Driver when your in Bali"

Putu is an extremely friendly, happy and welcoming person who takes great care of his customers. You simply have to like him immediately. Putu was born in Ubud, so he knows the area very well and we learned a lot about life on Bali. We just trusted him with the itinerary he suggested for the day and it turned out to be great. We would not have thought of most of the spots on our own and it was a good mix of nature and culture. Also Putu went above and beyond to make sure that we did not fall for any tourist traps, spend too much on entrance fees etc. For example he took a detour to a free lookout to show us the view of Mt. Batur instead of just going the easy way and letting us pay the entrance fee of the main viewing point. After being on the road for almonst 10 hours he still asked if we wanted to go for a little hike. He didn't seem to care about finishing work after a long day. His priority was that we have a good experience.We highly recommend a day tour with Putu and cannot think of anything bad to write about him. We felt really spoilt that day, because we could just lean back and enjoy beautiful Bali, while Putu had thought of everything. Thank you, Putu :)"

When he dropped us off in Amed at the end of the day it felt like saying goodbye to a friend. I would wholeheartedly recommend him for tours or transfers around Bali."

We wanted to go from ubud to candidasa and asked for some nature/scenery, a waterfall and maybe a temple, the rest we were easy. Putu suggested a few different routes, we settled on one, which brought us through stunning landscapes which surpassed our expectations, with Putu constantly checking in to see if we were happy or wanted a change of plan. He was happy to stop at any stage for photos and answer any questions about life in Bali. We would definitely recommend a day out with Putu, real value for money and you get to meet a really nice guy too!"

Putu was very quick and helpful to respond and, as he was already with guests on that day, he recommended Ketut as our driver. Ketut was so friendly and welcoming ( and, is a very safe driver, which was welcome on the windy roads through the mountains). He was extremely helpful in answering all our many, many questions about Bali and Indonesia. On the way to Amed, Ketut made several sightseeing stops (we even, by chance had he opportunity to see a temple ceremony) and he bus very knowledgeable about all the stories, details and history of each site. Would definitely call Putu and Ketut if we are back in Bali! Thanks again for the wonderful day, Ketut! :)"

Even with such a vague request, he ended up organizing the most amazing day in my life so far! I experienced the luxury of Ubud and also the ways of local living in Ubud by having an exquisite hot bath overlooking the Agung Mt., and having a mujair fish at a warung- he really knows every little things about Ubud since he's a local who's very experienced in his field. He even helped me to wash my shoes when I fell to the muds!

I have to say that when my husband advised he was hiring a private driver to take us around Bali, I was a little hesitant. I was worried that if we did not like the driver, we'd be stuck with the driver the entire trip because we already paid. Let me tell you, by the end of the trip I was actually sad to have to say goodbye to Putu and even tried to convince him to move back to the states with us! Ha! With his help we were able to see so many gorgeous sites in Bali. We have children and with the crazy drivers in Indonesia, I always felt very safe while he was driving my family around. We have so many memories from the places we visited. Even more than the sites we visited, we enjoyed Putu's company. He's genuinely a nice person and EVERYONE in my family was happy to have him as our tour guide. He truly looks out for your best interest and tells you what potential dangers to look out for with each location. Thank you, Putu, for everything!!

Then we were taken to the Monkey Forest which was brilliant and we had a marvellous time there before being taken to a lovely local restaurant over looking a rice paddy where we had a delicious and inexpensive lunch. We then went to the Temen Coffee Plantation where we had a lovely time tasting local teas and coffees including the famous monkey poo coffee Luwak which was delicious.It was then time to negotiate the traffic and get back to our ship.What a great day and this has a lot to do with the tour guide Putu Supartana and his driver who kept us fully informed about local history and customs and also kept us safe with expert driving.Because we did not get to do some shopping in the very interesting road side shops which were teaming with interesting things we will have to return to Bali and when we do Putu will be the first person we will contact to show us around."

Putu picked me up from my resort north of Ubud this morning for the Kintamani tour and was happy to allow me to customise the tour to suit my needs when asking if there was anything that I was particularly wanting to see. I really wanted to see Uluwatu which was well out of the tour area we were scheduled for, and I had a definite need to return to the resort for new year's celebrations, and somehow Putu managed to get me back in time. I had a great time chatting with Putu as we drove around the island talking about a whole range of things and can thoroughly recommend him as your Bali driver."

I wanted to put as a title 'putu nearly killed Andy' but was sure some people would take that literally - when in fact it refers to the fact that he took us to a local cafe and ordered something so hot it almost blew Andy's head off!We had some problems and so were late meeting Putu from our cruise ship. In fact, due to medical problems we had to end our cruise in Bali. Putu was more than happy to wait and didn't bat an eyelid when he saw we had turned up with all our suitcases.He took us to all the places we had on our list to see - and more. Nothing was too much trouble for him.He told us lots of useful information about Bali and how the Balinese people live. We wanted to learn about the country and learned so much from Putu.He was happy to wait patiently as we visited the many temples and attractions we visited. He is a very pleasant man with a very good sense of humour. Being with him lifts your mood!His car is large, Air conditioned and has wi fi in it. We felt very comfortable. It was even able to negotiate the sometimes steep and rocky roads he took us along.Due to our 'problems' with our cruise he even managed to find us a nice place to stay at short notice on our first day there. Overall I would say that Putu made our trip so enjoyable that I just could not imagine booking anyone else should you wish to discover the beautiful country of Bali and have someone drive you around who is not only helpful and knowledgeable but who instills in you a sense of happiness.Book Putu when you are in Bali - you won't regret it!"

He even provided saris for us to wear on visiting the temples.

I'd say we couldn't have chosen better. Highly recommended."

We booked this tour from the UK and it was decided that Putu would meet us in the lobby of our hotel at 8.30 on the morning of our tour. He was there early and we set off in his beautiful air conditioned car for our day out. We visited a local dance, volcano, temple, coffee plantation and stopped at lots of other places on our way. The whole day was excellent and Putu was the most careful driver and looked after us so well. We were out for over 11 hours. This was one of the best tours we have ever booked and would recommend Putu to anyone. He is very flexible and just wants you to enjoy your day.

As I had been to Bali several times before my interests were in the cultural and scenic aspects of Bali. This Putu achieved. We went to the scenic waterfalls which were spectacular and managed to get on the back of a motorbike to get back up the hill. As I am a senior this was no mean feat but it was very exciting t o say the least. We also went to the rice fields saw a few temples and I was able to take some amazing photos. At all times Putu explained about the customs of each place visited. I also booked him to take me back to the airport and visited other places on the return journey.

Putu is instantly likeable, with his obliging and extremely friendly nature, and he brightened my day with his constant laughter and good-naturedness. He is honest, sincere, and very open and willing to share all that he knows (which is a lot)! I had very enjoyable and informative conversations with him, about so many different things from Balinese culture, to Balinese religious beliefs and practices (most fascinating to me!), to the lifestyles of the locals, and about other beautiful places in Bali, hidden gems I hope I will be able to visit one day! I also learned interesting and eye-opening things at the rice terraces, about the farming community that owns the rice terraces and how they make collective decisions, and even how to tell up close whether a plant has rice inside or not!Thank you Putu for making my trip to Ubud memorable with all that I have learned from you. I would definitely recommend him for anyone looking for a guide and driver :) And I definitely hope to be back to learn and discover even more with him!"

But he has also given us useful tips about how to deal with the people who want to sell you things all the time and how to act politely and appropriately, for example in the temples or in the Balinese home.

He was always friendly and helpful and willing to be flexible as far as my itinerary went. Often spending 10 hours a day with him, I feel I got to know Putu very well. I was able to see so many great sights and attractions and Putu was always willing to suggest other places I might enjoy. He brought a sarong and sash each day so I would be able to enter the temples and we often were supervised by the local women while I stood beside the van and Putu made sure the sash and sarong were being worn properly. :) I don't think my wonderful experience in Bali would have been as great as it was, if I didn't have Putu as my driver. He has an excellent knowledge of Bali, the various local attractions, the Hindu culture and way of life. I was very impressed with his English and the depth of his views and opinions. We had many great conversations. He guided me as to what to expect in various places, and also advice on hotels, fastboat bookings, and shopping. He went beyond the call of duty to make sure I was settled in to my hotels and gave me an \"extra\" tour of Kuta so I could walk around there myself. I also found him to be less expensive than most of the other drivers. He was very conscientious and always was prompt in answering my emails. I hope others will book with this very reliable and friendly family man."

We had very little time to visit Bali, only 3 days arriving from Kuala Lumpur and leaving afterwards to Gili Islands, so we needed to make the most out of our time there. We chose Putu after contacting several options searched online mainly through Tripadvisor top ranking; we found his offer more personalized and flexible than other local alternative agencies or freelances, but at the same time very trustful, as per the quality of his itinerary proposal, his suggestions regarding the best sightseeing taking also into consideration the areas or activities too touristic or not suitable for our profile, his flexibility to deliver a comfortable minivan for our group of 10 persons when other companies couldn't match this requirement for such a large group, including two baby car seats for our 18-months infant and 3 years old girl. Once arrived at destination, Putu\u2019s delivery matched our great expectations, from his punctuality to his great recommendations as far as restaurants and dance shows were concerned. His driving was absolutely safe and his positive attitude under any circumstances contagious, making our stay there a nice time despite our challenging group including 4 adults, 2 grand-parents and 4 kids (among them two children under 3 years old). Putu took very good care of all our family, enabling us to enjoy Bali\u2019s experience with the pace of a holiday, being accurate about what not to miss but also including some extra cherished moments such as bathing with the kids in a temple water source, or enjoying a nice sunset at a recently opened lovely beach. Putu, a nice person and a great professional!"

As agreed Putu promptly picked us from the airport on-time and during the drive to Ubud answered every question we had. His knowledge is amazing and his english good (he is a quick leaner of english to his vocabulary). He took us around for 2 full days near Ubud and arranged anything which we needed at a very affordable price. He always gave us tips what to do and what not to do plus took us to some new surprisingly places which was not a part of the plan. he became a friend to us rather than a driver/guide. We missed him towards the end of our trip as he couldnt drive around legian/kuta. Hands-down very trustworthy, knowledge, friendly, safe driver and you cant miss it if you are in Bali. I am still looking for a 6th-star to rate him. Thank You Putu for taking us around Bali and our friendly conversations."

We learnt few bahasa phrases from Mr. Putu.Finally when we left Bali, we felt that we were saying bye to a family member.As Putu himself says that he looks out for client satisfaction, he means every word in that.We can't recommend Putu enough!

My Partner and I booked Putu while we were in Bali over Christmas based on his Trip Advisor reviews to check out the Bali outside of Seminyak. He replied quickly to my emails and helped us to organise a wonderful day trip on New Years Eve based on the places we wanted to see: Monkey Forest in Ubud, Tegalalang Rice Terrace, Kintamani Volcano, Tirta Empul temple and Gunung Kawi.Putu arrived on time, was very knowledgeable and spoke great English. We learnt so much and he knew the answers to all our questions and then some! He provided sarongs for our visits to temples, gave us advice for the area's and places we travelled to and had umbrellas for the afternoon rains so we didn't get wet. Putu was forever patient with our wanderings, never rushed us and let us take our time. A safe driver and he knows his way around the island too, dodging congested traffic areas and sparing us from sitting in the crazy Christmas / New Years traffic when we were heading home to our villa in the midst of Seminyak. We had a fantastic day with Putu who is not only an excellent guide but a wonderful, happy, humble and positive person. He could not help us enough and went out of his way to ensure we were enjoying ourselves throughout the day. Even at 5pm on New Years Eve with a drive still ahead of us he was offering to take us to a silversmith! I cannot recommend Putu enough and I will definitely be contacting him on my next trip to Bali. An independent driver, friendly, punctual, safe, flexible and every other positive quality a person could have is Putu, a day with him is a must for your Bali holiday! Thank you Putu for making our last day of 2014 a memorable one :-)"

As i am 7months pregnant, he was caring about me a lot in driving. Though he was a driver not a guid, he taught us how we entered, the route we went and about background of the places we visited and so on before he dropped us, which was enough explanations for us to go sightseeing by ourselves.We were so comfortable with him, so we also asked him to drive to the next hotel to kuta the other day.we highly recommend you to book a driving tour to Putu driver in Ubud, if you want to make a plan of sightseeing by yourself. he will help you to go wherever you wanna go."

Challenging trek (very steep near the top) but extremely rewarding. Putu was great - picked us up on time (we were located at two different hotels), offered a competitive rate and had three guides (for three people) which made the experience run smoothly. I was the slowest of my group and Putu stayed with me the entire time, offering me a hand when needed. The hot springs were not what I expected - I thought they were going to be in a natural pool but the water was in man made pools (natural hot spring water though). Although it wasn't as expected, it was definitely worth going to after a long hike - helped to relieve our muscles!We had a lunch (included in the price) at a restaurant with the most magnificent view. We were also offered to stop at sights on the way back (included in price), but we were exhausted so decided to go straight back to the hotel. Pickup and drop off offered from our hotels in Kuta. Overall the guides were friendly and funny and very knowledgeable about the area. We learned a lot about the volcanoes, wildlife, trees and cultural traditions. I felt very safe, despite having to hike in the darkness. I would definitely recommend!"

I did not want the tour to include any shopping, museums or other temples. We just wanted to see the beautiful scenery. They put together a very nice, easy paced itinerary which was just what we wanted. We also enjoyed the restaurant they suggested .what I really liked about our guide Ketut Widana was that he had excellent driving skills and very good command of English language. He was a relaxing , peaceful person to be around and took good care of my mother who had mobility issues. Would definately recommend this company and guide and time- permitting will use them agsin before I leave Bali."

I do recall the trip was suppose to cover the local school and traditional market but we did not do that during the tour. Our guide Ketut speaks good english. He picked us up on time. Perhaps it is because i told him this is not my first time in Bali, he did not explain the history of the monument much.Day 2 we booked trekking and spa tour. Our tour guide, Gusti, was an excellent guide. He is very passionate about his work. Because we missed the traditional market, he brought us to one of the small market and explained the tradition of offering flowers to the god, the purpose of each temple at each locality. He then brought us to a \"only known to the local\" trekking spot where he kindly prepared sun hat, walking stick, cold drinking water, and even cold towels. He was very attentive and care for our safety. I especially liked the experience of asking for god permission before we start our trek on a steeper and more slippery trek. it demonstrate humbleness and gave me a whole new understanding towards balinese spirituality and culture. along the trek, he explained to us how the farmers plant, and harvest the rice. we met few very pleasant farmers along the way. the spa at the end of the trekking was a great ending to the whole experience. all in all, i would recommend this tour company as it is supporting local business and i like the fact that the guides really do enjoy their work."

He was very timely picking us up from our hotel and was dressed in traditional clothing. He has a nice large vehicle and we were very comfortable. The 1st day he took us up to Ubud to go on a river rafting tour. The drive was almost 2 hours and he was wonderful explaining all about Bali to us on our drive up. He answered all of our questions and we really felt we got to know the culture of the area just by talking with him. Our rafting tour was 2 hours and he was waiting for us and had held us a table for lunch when we returned. After lunch the plan was to just take us back to the hotel, but he asked if we would like to see more of the area. Of course, we said yes! He brought us to traditional rice terraces and hiked around with us and took some great photos of our family. He took us to a beautiful temple. We told him we loved wood furniture and he took us around to lots of furniture shops and even to a wood carving studio where they explained to us about all the different woods they use and how they carve, etc. It was an amazing day!!The 2nd day we used him our plan was to do a downhill bicycle ride. He drove us the 1.5 hours to the start of our ride, once again with fabulous narration along the way. He waited until our trip was over and we had finished our lunch. Then once again he took us on a tour of the area on the way home. We stopped at the most gorgeous waterfall and he was able to get us permission to climb halfway up. He climbed with us and took some amazing photographs of our family.All in all. Bali Traditional Tours, and driver Wyan, helped make our stay in Bali Fantastic!!"

But more importantly through our guide we got a personal insight in traditional Hindu family lifestyle and its beliefs and values.

We booked 3 tours with Bali Traditional Tour (Volcano, Terrace Rice and Ubud) that are definitively very nice with Widana.

Do the best, help other and be happy on what you have without thinking about what you would like to have, because is your way.

His first question to use was, have you had breakfast. Not only were the shops, and sites he took us to amazing and beautiful, but his intimate knowledge added a unique color and flavor to the places we were visiting. He was not shy to answer any questions, we had about the social interactions, language, religion, and more. He was also very keen on our interest and would offer more insight inline with out interests. He was also our advocate when it came to bargaining at the local markets, and didn't take us only to the more posh and pricy markets. He even picked us fresh ripe guavas from tree at home when he learned that we liked Guava. Ketut is a very intelligent, thoughtful and funny person, and great company.This tour company and Tour guide is strongly recommended. The tour itself was amazing, and thoughtfully put together. We got to see the beautiful rice terraces, visit and fed bananas to the monkeys in the Monkey Forest, taste delicious Lewack coffee (at a fraction of what you would pay for in the states) and teas, learned about a historical Elephant Cave (Gao Gajah) temple, and archeological site, and took in the beauty of a once secluded waterfall, and more.

Thankfully we had the confirmation in our inbox the next morning shortly before 8am. They did call our homestay however and asked whether the tour could be started half an hour later due to the short notice, of course that was no problem for us. Our guide Oka was right on time so we could start the Bedugul tour. I won't go into details about the touristic sights as you can find information about these anywhere on the net. Instead I will focus on Oka and the great service he provided.My girlfriend was generally sceptical about guided tours, fearing they'd just rip you off, pressuring you to buy stuff at places where they get a commission and that a guide would hardly be more than a driver. She was proven wrong all the way as Oka was very professional and kind. We've met only a few Indonesians during our time on Bali and Lombok whose English was on par with Oka's (although he does have an accent, it's easy to understand). It was also very important to him that we understood that we did not have to buy anything at the stops we made (e.g. coffe plantation). In general he explained a lot about the Balinese culture and answered any questions that we had asked us since we landed on Bali a week before. Definitely worth the money as it was overall a great experience. Thank you Oka!"

This was my 10th trip to Bali and although I know how cheap you can get a driver for a day, its worth spending that bit more money and hiring a specialized tour guide. Having a guide that deals with all the small things from entry fees through to sarongs for temple was a bonus but the real value comes with the history and tradition that our guide Yande was so happy to share. A bonus with this tour is a guided walk through a local market, expect something different here, a visit to a local primary school, a real highlight for us and sharing some local market treats with Yande and his family at his home. One of our must visits on our list was Tirta Empul temple. This is one of the most important temples in Bali because of its holy water that is used for purification by the locals. My wife and I felt comfortable participating in the purification experience with Yand\u2019s guidance to ensure we maintained the required respect that is so important here. This was an absolute highlight of my many visits to Bali. The temple grounds surrounding the natural spring are magnificent and we were lucky enough to see locals preparing for an up and coming ceremony. Regardless of what you decide to tour, the car was very clean and comfortable, drinking water was provided, stop anywhere and as long as you like, Yandes English was very good and would definitely recommend this company.

They said they did and an hour and a half later Yande was able to meet us at our hotel. He showed us the rice fields, coffee / spice plantation, holy spring temple, mount batur, and showed us his house at the very end. He was incredibly knowledgeable, kind to us, and made great conversation. He was also willing to shift any sights we wanted to see around and fit extra stops in on the way. So if you have a flexible schedule, this is a huge plus! Yande explained the reasoning behind everything we saw in great detail. I really appreciated this insight and background, and it made the sights much more special in my opinion. We also got to wear traditional Balinese wear when entering the holy spring temple, lent to us by him. I would highly recommend booking with a guide + driver if you can, and Bali Traditional Tours seems like a great family owned company. We really enjoyed our time with Yande and would contact him again!"

We were driven by Made from our hotel to a number of beautiful sites. Starting at the local market and then driven to the spectacular sight of hundreds of Hindu devotees washing and blessing themselves at a nearby temple. Then taken to visit a coffee ( best tasting coffee ever) plantation and dropped of for a very tasty and reasonably priced lunch overlooking a rice paddock . Rounded off by Made taking us to his family home to see how local bali families live. Throughout Made was a joy,so friendly and smiling, a great host and expertly explained the fantastic Bali culture to us simply and with a great sense of humour. A better day out I could barely imagine. I would pay double for this ( As a tight scot I don't say this very often) . You really can't afford to miss this experience and if you are lucky enough to have Made as your driver then the day won't get better."

A couple of days before the scheduled trip we had to postpone as our son was not well. They had no issues with this and rescheduled as requested. We also indicated that we did not want to go to the Monkey Forest and the price was adjusted down accordingly.On the day our driver arrived on time with a clean and well-maintained car. Our tour guide and driver for the day was Komang. He was friendly, knowledgeable and full of information.At the onset, he confirmed with us what we would like to do for the day and structured the rest of the day accordingly.We went to a local handicraft store which had a great range of souvenirs and Balinese art. We found the prices better than Legian and other touristy areas.Komang took us to a traditional market and was generous enough to buy as local delicacies which were a great touch. His generosity and warmth were on show throughout the day. He even tracked down some Jackfruit that I was keen to try and paid for it himself!We visited the Ubud area and visited a waterfall and coffee plantation.I should have probably requested that we wanted to try lunch at a local restaurant. Instead, we were taken to a very touristy restaurant which was expensive and okay food.A visit to the temple and the rice terrace was fantastic, and we had plenty of time to do some more shopping. We needed some baby supplies on the way back and even though it was getting very late Komang took us to a supermarket.Overall we enjoyed the trip with Bali Traditional Tours. There are cheaper tours out there but the level of personalised service, attention to detail and generosity was worth the extra money.Thank you Komang, you are an asset to your company.Suksama."

From the start to finish this tour was incredible due to our incredible guide Ketut Widana or as he's known by us simply 'Wi'Wi took us to a traditional morning market, silver shop where we could see the process and an art studio. He never rushed us and throughout the drive he was informative and great fun. From there we went to a padi rice field took incredible photos we then started our drive to mount Batu. On the way we stopped at Boni Bali restaurant which was stunning views and delicious food. From there we drove up to the mountain which was breath taking we sore the volcano mountain and sights that I couldn't believe. After we went to a coffee plantation. The staff at the plantation were so helpful and informative and the drinks were amazing! After this we went to a holy spring temple. This was so calming and again simply beautiful. Wi explained everything to us and made the tour so much more interesting. He's also an amazing photographer! We then went to a final temple in the river a walk of 340 steps to get to this temple but Wi was right it was well worth it! On the way home we stopped at a traditional house which was great to see how the people live and again Wi gave us an indepth insight as to family life in bali. I can't thank Wi enough for making our tour so special I would recommend this tour to anyone."

We especially enjoyed the visit to the traditional market and the temples we visited. Another mention goes to Ketut here for running through the rain to bring us umbrellas! Overall, we would fully recommend this tour and the company. The value for money is outstanding and if we had more time we would have booked more tours with them. Michael and Olivia Harrison"

We visited Ubud on our honeymoon and only had a few days, so we were eager to see and learn as much as possible in two full day tours while avoiding tourist traps. Our guide Yande was the perfect combination of local friend, safe driver, and cultural historian. On top of all this, it was easy to see how he dedicated he is to his professions - being a traditional rice farmer as well as tour guide - while maintaining his family and religious responsibilities. Really puts work life balance into perspective. Yande had endless patience to answer all of our questions and an ever present smile. He was flexible to our schedule and interests, and made extra efforts to ensure we were well fed, watered, and informed about the meanings behind symbols, language, art, culture, food and farming. He was even kind enough to bring us to his home, farm, and his kids' school. Aside from two famous temples and Jatiluwih (rice fields) we visited smaller, local attractions and artists that barely had any tourists. We were stunned by Yande's generous nature and had many funny moments and laughs together. We couldn't have asked for a better local guide and would highly recommend his family-run tour company to anyone visiting Bali."

            "review": "Kintamani Tour. This tour was amazing!! First off, my wife had planned this tour where the only thing we wanted to do was bathe in the Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple, so everything else would have been a plus. The only problem was we had already visited a coffee plantation and went around the traditional market the day before. Well, let me introduce you to Made, who accommodated our wants and needs perfectly! We told him about having seen part of the attractions, as well as some other things we wanted to do instead, and Made had no hesitation to fit in the new plans with ease! THIS IN ITSELF DESERVES THE HIGH RATING I COULD GIVE IT! There's so many tour guides that merely \"stick-to-the-plan\" without any consideration to the buyer. (granted, I should have known before booking, but my wife booked it, what can I say??) So, with Made's suggestions, our tour went like this: Stopped by a convenient store to buy snacks and candies for our second stop... visiting a local primary school. This was more fun than I initially thought; the kids were fun to play with, very cute, and seemed to warm up to visitors easily (maybe because they saw we had candies!). After that, we went to the Holy Water Temple and were able to bathe! Made did an excellent job explaining the traditions and courtesies of the temple as well as taking pictures. He even brought the sarongs and bought towels for us to dry off afterwards. After a tour around the rest of the temple and the springs, we drove to a lookout spot to see Batur Lake and the adjacent volcano. Because we had already been to a coffee and fruit plantation, we went straight to lunch at Boni Bali that overlooks some rice terraces. The timing was perfect because it started to rain as we sat down which gave a wonderful view and air to our lunch. Made explained that he suggested this restaurant as opposed to another spot due to a bad review. As confused as I was to think this kind of service could garnish a bad review, I must say thank you to that reviewer, because this new lunch spot was beautiful! After lunch we skipped the second temple and went from the rice terraces to a traditional Balinese home. We even met with the owner of the company as the family's home we visited was his own's! Very refreshing to see faces instead of names when going through tours with such high praise. Because we had enough time left (because we had skipped a few attractions at our own request) we were able to stop by a silver and gold mining and trading company. There, Made made sure we didn't feel pressured to buy, but when we were ready to, he also made sure we haggled with the prices. All in all, this was one of the most friendly, professional, and enjoyable tours I have been on. So much so, that it made me sign up for a TripAdvisor log-in just so I could write a review on them! I have no problems recommending these professional tour guides to my friends and family!"

There are many great reasons why Bali Traditional Tours is #1 on Trip Advisor, but the main one is that the guides are passionate about giving you the best personal experience that matches your interests and desires. We had an outstanding day with Gusti. He picked us up as planned in a clean, late model, air-conditioned vehicle. We spent the early part of the day seeing the Balinese cultural dance, followed by trips to the waterfall and Ubud Monkey Forest. The time we spent at each stop and the things we did were totally within our control. We took a little extra time to hike to the top of the waterfall, and we really got into the monkeys - no problem. Gusti spent a lot of time telling us about the ways of life on Bali - how girls leave their homes to join the extended families of their husbands and how multiple generations live under a single roof - about how Balinese homes are constructed as part of a compound and the function of each building in the compound.Finally, at the end of the day, Gusti told us that he wanted to take us to a Balinese house to show us many of the things he had shared. When we arrived, we learned that Gusti had actually brought us to his own home where we were able to meet his mother, his children and his grandfather. It was a great personal touch that really made the day special. We started the day with a tour guide but ended it with a friend."

After lunch we visited \"coffee plantation\", Cavatik Agriculture. It is just a coffee shop with some testers which tasted good. Do not buy anything with sugar inside because you will get less of the coffee and the prices are pretty high allready. So basically we visited two temples according to the program and the rest on the program is commission based for the company, as we have been traveling for a while and have been on the tours like this. It is also first time we had a tour which had no lunch included. After visit to the restaurant Oka called his boss and he mentioned something about discount for poor choice of the restaurant, but in the end we paid the amount which is mentioned on the website and no discount.

This is very common in all trips you can find in Ubud but we also went to traditional Balinese primary school and the most interesting part was visit into our guides homestay. As it was a ceremony in his village we were given local cakes, jams and other food. Also we could meet his wife and rest of the family.

While in Bali we changed the date of the trip and they were very obliging and happy to help. Our tour guide Wi ( Ketut Widana) arrived on time at our hotel in traditional Balinese clothing and a clean air conditioned car. We had a fab day exploring Bali..we visited a local market, primary school and two different Balinese homes... One was the owner of the company. We had a lovely welcome from him and were kindly shown around his family compound and met his family. We visited Pura Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple which is a must do trip for everyone. What an amazing place. We visited a fruit and coffee plantation, saw Kintamini Volcano and Lake Batur... And the whole day was filled with so many facts and so much interesting information from Wi whose passion for Bali and insight into the Hindu religion will remain with us always. We recommend this company as an amazing company to share the inside secrets of Bali. Our day finished with a fabulous and relaxing massage in the family Spa where we were greeted with a cup of ginger tea and asked to select our treatment. The service and treatment we received was wonderful and so relaxing. More tea and light refreshments completed our visit to the Spa. Wi then drove us back to the hotel. A truly memorable day!"

We both loved the tour!Here are a few highlights of the day tour: he took us to his own traditional Balinese house providing with detailed explanations on Bali household culture at first. We would have not ever had the opportunity looking into local houses without him. We loved it. Then we had a chance to enjoy a great view of Mt. Batur, the well-known volcano in Ubud, on a loft top of the local restaurant that he had a friend with. The view was breath-taking, and we stayed there without any interruptions as it was on the top of a private property. Luckily a Hindu ceremony was taking place at Holy Temple so we had a full glimpse of the ceremony. The last highlight of the trip was the last dinner in Bali on the way to the airport (it was our last day in Bali). We had dinner at a super legit local outdoor restaurant on the street. It was the best ever real local food that we took.I was debating whether we should take a private tour and it turns out to be totally worth it!"

We saw SO much in two days including the Tanah Lot temple, rice terraces, a morning market, the Monkey Forest, Elephant Safari, the Holy Spring Temple, the Royal temple, coffee plantation plus his own home. It was a very busy two days and it would be hard to say which parts I liked the best as they all were amazing. I sure think it would be such an incredible shame to come all the way to Bali and not see all the things that make it like no other place on earth.

Our guide-driver, Komang, was on time to pick us up and the vehicle we used was quite good. We enjoyed the said day trip and so decided to do another tour the next day, the Uluwatu tour. Again, with the same guide-driver, Komang.We truly appreciate the flexibility of the tour agency as we had decided to take the Uluwatu tour at last minute. . Both tours are all well-worth it, interesting and fun. Komang was patient, accommodating and a very good driver. For the Bedugul tour, make sure to walk the rice paddies of Jatiluwin (a UNESCO heritage site) and not just take pictures of it. Taman Ayun temple is impressive. For Uluwatu Tour, the beaches are really nice. So, it's a must to take a dip. Bring some swim wear and a lot of sunblock. The trip to the Uluwatu temple was maybe long but Komang drives fast and efficiently so the trip was quite comfortable"

Itinerary was as follows:Local market - mildly interesting but they were closing up for the daySilver jewellery - be very careful. The sterling silver jewellery is beautiful but unless you negotiate hard it will be more expensive than at home. Aim for 70-80% discountTegenungan waterfall - changed the itinerary to include this.

Communication worked perfect and the guide picked as up right at out hotel. We saw some many amazing places and our guide provided us with a lot of interesting information about bali culture and live. We could even visit his family's house compound. I can recommend this tour agency to everybody to get as much as possible from your trip to bali! Ask for Gusti which was a very friendly and funny guide with a lot of material knowledge. He was our guide, driver, photographer and friend! Thanks a lot for the nice time."

I will say upfront that our love affair with Nyoman began about 8 years ago when the Bali Gods smiled on us and he turned up as our tour guide on our first visit. We fell in love immediately with his broad friendly smile as he ascertained our Balinese names. Since then he has been an integral part of our many visits and we were delighted and honoured to be some of his first guests when he opened the Day Spa last year - and I posted a glowing review accordingly.We have done every tour on the website and have created our own itineraries as well - however we hadn\u2019t done the Rice Trek tour - Rice field trek, lunch and spa, as my husband\u2019s legs are a bit wobbly ( I\u2019m not an Olympian myself) . We chose to give it a go when Nyoman assured us he had a more gentler alternative. The day turned out to be splendid - we set off on a beautiful sunny Ubud day - Initially the walk was a bit scrambly and muddy however Nyoman was always at our elbow to help guide (and pull) us until we reached a large wide flat concrete path that wound through picturesque green rice fields for rest of the walk. We enjoyed an excellent lunch at a nice restaurant with a lovely view before hitting the spa - and my how that has grown... See my review for spa.Another special & memorable day."

We actually did many tours before, on Java, Bali and Lombok, but this one was the best! Our guide Ketut Ajus showed us so many nice places, told us so much about the culture and history and cared really nicely for us. The tour was well organised and more then comfortable for us. It started with a traditional market, where Ketut showed and bought us local fruits we didn't know before. Next we went to see some amazing temples and had lunch at a very good and authentic place. Afterwards we saw the volcano and did a coffee tasting at a coffee farm. Ketut told us about all the herbs and spices that grow there (so many new things for us Germans ;) ). And the best part about the trip was that after a amazing day, Ketut showed us his home, where he lives with his parents, his wife and two sweet girls. It was a pleasure spending the day with him! Ask for Ketut when booking a tour, you will love it!Thanks for the amazing day! Alex & Ela"

First stop was a look at his living area, in which we gain more insight into traditional living style of a bali household. Next was the volcano attraction which was the highlight of the trip. We get to see a clear view of the volcano without the obstruction of other tourists. For lunch, we get to have lunch among the fields with chickens all around us. A visit to the water temple and the cliff temple was great too.

They accept USD and local currency in cash. No cards. The guide Gusti is a very enthusiastic and chirpy man who brought us to his home and showed us the traditional Balinese lifestyle. He spoke all along the way enriching us with details of Bali culture. He was also dressed traditionally with a cap and sarong. Our trip was customisable and we had flexibility to revise timings at our discretion. We went to a temple with rock carvings called Gunung Kawi with 300 steps. That was a major workout! Then we drove to the town of Kintamani and saw the volcanic mountain. We saw a traditional market. We then had lunch in the heart of the rice terraces of Ubud and stopped for coffee at a coffee plantation. Gusti even helped us secure the next day's agenda and worked our bookings for adventure sports and spa keeping our preferences in mind. We used Bali traditional tours the next day too for this customised trip. The costs are very reasonable and the guides make it worth every penny. Book this tour now. You will love it."

He organized our tour very well and asked out input throughout to make sure we did everything we wanted. He knew the best areas to avoid at certain times so we would be relaxed and avoid the bulk of other tourists, yet we still got to see everything! He chose a great restaurant for lunch that looked out with great views of the volcanos. We had specific souvenirs we wanted to buy and he took us to places he knew that wouldn't rip us off and give us great quality. We were incredibly impressed. We used this service for two days which Wayan accommodated us by taking us from our hotel in Ubud to Nusa Dua while seeing the sites in between. We say he spoiled us, this was our first time using a personal tour guide and we don't think we can use a group again. I strongly encourage reaching out to this tour group when you visit Bali. We will use him again on out next visit!"

We had the most lovely tour guide called Made Midiarsana who spoke such good English and was so informative during the whole day. It was such a jam packed fun day. He took us to the best viewing spot of Kintamani which was at a lovely restaurant where we stopped for lunch. Other parts of the day included visiting a traditional Balinese market which was a real insight to their daily lives, seeing two temples that left us in awe, rice fields and a coffee plantation which again showed us the true Balinese culture and finally to his uncles family home which was a surreal experience as we really got to see exactly how the life is for the Balinese people. All in all we absolutely without a doubt recommend going on a Bali Traditional Tour and request Made as your host or should we say, your friend for the day. Thank you so much for such a cool experience and for showing us around your beautiful country. An experience we will never forget!"

The guide was helpful, knowledgable, and super friendly. They even let us change our tour date because of rain for no extra charge! the sites are beautiful and the staff professional. The guide even taught us about his religion and family/home life there in Bali. (We LOVE learning about other cultures and his information was extremely welcome.) I learned so much on that tour.

We were picked up at our hotel by courteous and friendly Wayan (meaning first born) Suarjana +62812 37236790We then discussed briefly various options that coincided with our interest and our capabilities (not too good with hundreds of steps at age 71). It was obvious that he was really flexible and just wanted a day to make us as happy as possible. Our first stop was the local fruit and vegetable markets where I was able to video the making and filling of the intricate offering baskets and tasting a locally made cake. We dropped into a very interesting and beautiful coffee plantation where you get to taste 8 different hot beverages including, ginger, cocoa, vanilla and Bali coffee. But the high light is seeing the wild civet responsible for the Kopi Luwak. We then made our way up to Tegallallang and had lunch overlooking a spectacular view of the Batur mountain and Batur lake (largest in Bali).  The temple complex of Tira Empul (means holy water spring) is probably most famous and sacred because of its holy water that is used for purification. We witness the unique purification ceremonies which anyone can participate. One unexpected surprise was a luxurious swimming pool previously enjoyed by the colonial elite now home to a huge number of happy giant carp in many colours. However, the hilite of the trip has to be a visit to Wayan's traditional Balinese home where we were treated to its unique design and layout, refreshments, meeting his beautiful daughters and his extensive garden which included many trees and bonsais. He has also recently planted huge plots of vegetables as well as fruit trees including papaya and orange. We exchanged so many stories comparing each other's cultures and lives that it's difficult to believe that we only met a few hours ago."

I was picked up promptly by Made who started sharing fantastic information about Bali straight away. We visited the local market where I was able to see the traditional experience - very different to the centre of Ubud. I also had the chance to try some local foods including delicious cakes - yum!The rest of the day continued in such a fantastic way and Made kept sharing interesting information and was very patient with me taking lots of photos as we visited two temples (Tirta Empul and Gunung Kawai), Kintamani, a localcoffee plantation and the rice terraces. He even stopped at the roadside a few times to give me more insight into the rice growing/harvesting process which I said I was interested in. A highlight was visiting a Balinese home at the end of the day. I was very grateful for this insight. I would definitely recommend this trip - whether you're a group of travelling alone like me. Thank you Made for such a wonderful experience!"

This tour allows you to experience authentic Bali, which can sometimes be lost in the more tourist areas of the country. Activities include visiting the Spring Water Temple, Ballenise coffee plantation, rice plantation and visiting a traditional Balenise house and family (a personal highlight). The tour guide, in our case Made, ensured that the experience was thoroughly enjoyable and unique and was full of knowledge and passion for his country. A lovely man who couldn't do enough for us throughout the tour.

On our second last day in Bali we booked this day trip with Bali Traditional tours and the trip surpassed our expectations so much.We stayed in the Seminyak Beach resort and from emails back and fourth we settled on a tailored trip through Ubud. Wayan meet us at the hotel and we set off on our trip which was to see the monkey temple, Tagalalang rice terrace, Pura Tirta Empul, Coffee Plantation, Lunch stop, Coffee Plantation, Tegenungan waterfall and a traditional Balinese house. Every stop was brilliant.Wayan was a great tour guide and driver. I would also add he takes good pictures and he held onto our possessions when going into the waterfall and the holy springs at the temple. We felt safe at all times with Wayan's driving, he beeps at every blind turn and is composed on the crazy roads around Bali. He speaks great English and he knows so much about his culture and the Balinese history, he even asked us questions and no doubt learned abit about Scottish culture too. He took loads of pictures for us and even took us to the best places to take pictures at each location. He is also very flexible on where you visit and what you do, the trip isn't booked as under one ticket so if there is something you want to miss just say and he can take you anywhere you want or suggest alternatives for you. For tea or coffee lovers the plantation is a must do, they give you the best selection of locally made tea and coffee and they have a shop to buy your own which we made full use of.We had a truly brilliant day out and it's one that we will never forget. Thank you Wayan"

The scenery was absolutely beautiful and even though it took two hours it didn't feel that long because we were enjoying it so much. We were a bit nervous at first about getting out to swim in the river but the water was very refreshing and cool, it was a highlight you should definitely try. The best part of the tour though was our driver Jaya who picked us up and dropped us off, he was very friendly, spoke great English and was very happy to answer all our questions about Balinese and Hindu culture. It made the two hour each way drive very enjoyable and we learned a lot about the local culture. The only thing I would say that might make the rafting tour unsuitable for some is that you have to go down and up a lot of stairs to get to and from the river. It wasn't a problem for us but it might make the tour unsuitable for anyone with certain health issues so might be best to ask before booking.Thanks Bali Traditional Tours and Wayan and Jaya for a great day out :)"

He really went the extra mile in every place we visited, to ensure we experienced everything, including buying us some delicious local fruits from the market we visited, as we'd never tried them before, such a lovely gesture. He also took us to his own house to see the way a typical Balinese family lives which was so great! We met his family and it was so interesting to get that insight, he was so warm, open and friendly. Oka's driving was also great, very safe (unlike some taxi drivers!) and we felt completely at ease. The tour has the perfect mix of elements and a great pace. We really came away feeling we'd seen a lot of what Bali has to offer. The price is really worth it, as it made an incredible difference to have such a professional guide with us as we saw and experienced many things that we wouldn't have known about or been able to do on our own with a driver.

My boyfriend and I had a limited amount of time in Ubud, so we decided to book a tour in order to get a good overview of all of the nearby attractions. We booked the Kintimani Tour (day tour) through Bali Traditional Tours, and I'm glad that we did because Wayan was an awesome tour guide. Our hotel offered a similar tour, but they do not speak English as well as Wayan does. He was able to understand and answer all of our questions regarding all sorts of obscure topics. In addition, we were not interested in doing the luwak coffee plantation, so he was able to customize our tour for us. Wayan was also a very good driver that made us feel very safe in his car even going around winding narrow roads with two-way traffic.By far the most special and unique part of the experience was being taken to the traditional Balinese family compound, which was Wayan's house. His gracious and kind wife treated us to young coconut water, peanut fritters, and cakes that she had made for their Saraswati offering that morning. We also met his curious daughters, who also knew some English and asked us some questions. Overall, it was a wonderful experience to meet Wayan's family and see how a normal Balinese family lives.We lucked out on our tour, since we booked during Saraswati which was a holiday for most Balinese and many of them were dressed traditionally and praying and making offerings at the temples that we visited. We truly appreciate Wayan taking the time out of this sacred day to spend with us. Tickets for the temples were included in the price, with the exception of an additional temple (Goa Gajah) that we visited with him since that was an unplanned stop. Lunch at Kintimani is a buffet and includes coffee and tea, but other drinks are not included in the buffet price. Wayan was aware that the Tegallalang rice paddies had recently been harvested, so he took us to other rice fields as well to see the view and also watch the rice being planted by the locals.Wayan did everything possible to make sure we had the best experience we could have had, and went out of his way to invite us into his home and allow us to meet his family. We had a wonderful day and it has been a highlight of our vacation so far. I definitely recommend booking this tour with Wayan, and additional ones if you have the time."

Our tour guide was a young man named Made who was knowledgable and passionate about his country, full of little pieces of trivia and quite funny! He is a lovely person and we can't recommend him enough.

Gus gave us the perfect amount of privacy and alone time and also gave us so much information on the country and culture but always made it fun and funny! I can't put into words how wonderful Gus was, he was the kindest man I have ever met and knew exactly what to say and do. I was quite scared to go to monkey forest but he was so kind and caring and I always felt so safe. He is really funny and speaks amazing English but is always trying to learn more which is so sweet. He apologises all of the time for small things like if he doesn't understand something or if he overtakes a car which is so sweet. He is just so lovely and this tour wouldn't of been the same without him showing us everywhere. He kept calling my boyfriend 'Jake' 'jack sparrow' the whole trip which made us always laugh. We bought him a bintang vest when we went shopping because he said how much he loved it and he was so grateful!P.S if you get Gus as your tour guide ask him to say 'salesman', we taught him how to say it and it was so funny because he couldn't pronounce it properly, so if you want to smile and be made laugh ask him to say 'salesman'.I would highly recommend this tour and Gus too!

He was so patient, informative, gunny, and all around knowledge and happy to answer any questions we had about their culture.Their service and how they treat their customers met beyond my expectations. If it's your first time I'm Bali I would not hesitate to recommend a guided tour. There's so many places spread throughout the island, and it's nice to have a local guide tell you and teach you about their customs and culture. Not to mention that driving in Bali is not for the faint of heart!! The roads are small (some not kept very well) and lots of motorbikes swerving around.One other unscheduled stop that really made it more special; we were invited and we're able to witness a village ceremony that normally happens only every 5 years!! Amazing! I'm glad Nyoman asked if we wanted to stop, and also grateful to those who invited us in so generously!!Special thank you to Nyoman for making it one of the best days during our vacation to Ubud!!Pros:-Range of tours to choose from-Service and friendliness of staff is exceptional-Air conditioned vehicle -Price for what you get is a great deal-Their spa is a must visit. Relaxing and the massage was top notch.-Family owned business-Cons:None that I can think of!! Tips:-Book a spa. The massages are amazing, prices are great, and service is wonderful. Can't eave enough and it's definitely worth it after a long tour!!-Don't buy any coffee or tea at the plantation stop. It does not taste the same when you get home!! Prices are also way too high.-If there's an unexpected stop, and you guide asks you, definitely stop!! You never know what you'll get to experience."

Car was very new, spacious and had good air con! Day started at 9am and finished at approx 4:30pmIt was a brilliant day and really our highlight across 2 weeks in Bali. ketut had some really good recommendations and we then chose our itinerary. It was a very full and varied day.Tour included...1) stop off at rice fields2) tour off a traditional Bali Compound3) Visit to monkey sanctuary4) Lunch at a beautiful restaurant were you could overlook pond and rice fields5) tour of the elephant temple.6) stop off at local supermarket to get groceries!I know I'm probably not doing the tour justice, but it was brilliant. Ketut was very good, he had a great manner and was very happy to answer any questions we had. He also had a good ability to know when to talk and also when to give our family time.Excellent tour and would highly recommend.Thank you."

We had 3 great days with this tour company - the first day we did the Kintamani tour, the second day we went rafting and then shopping, and the third day we combined the Bedugul with the Tanah Lot tours. All were great experiences, and the prices were low. If you have three days available, I would recommend following this itinerary."

I frequently right reviews listing the pros and cons of whatever operation I\u2019m reviewing, however, for this review I don\u2019t have any negatives to list. Both days were excellent and we had a wonderful time. Our guide was Gusti (Gus for short) and he was excellent in every way. We visited a traditional Balinese market, went to the Taman Ayun Temple, ate lunch after walking through the Jatiluwih rice terraces, visited Tanah Lot Temple and viewed a beautiful waterfall after shopping at a batik factory. Throughout our travels Gus explained Balinese culture, traditions and the Hindu faith. In every regard Gus exemplified kind, gentle and reverent values that shaped his personality. In a very real sense, getting to know Gus was as much of the tour as were the places we visited. On the second day we visited his \u201cfamily compound\u201d and met his parents and two daughters. We loved learning about how his extended family lives together. Gus shared more information with us than we\u2019ll ever remember, but we loved learning as much as we could.As far as the tour mechanics worked, Gus met us at our hotel at 9:00 AM both days. We traveled in a nearly new small Toyota SUV (similar to a RAV4 in the US) and the day concluded between 4:00 and 6:00 PM. Gus customized the schedule to accommodate reservations we\u2019d made for an afternoon massage\u2026 We enjoyed the places he suggested for lunch. We enthusiastically recommend Bali Traditional Tours -"

I'm not usually keen on writing reviews, but my boyfriend and I both thought that our experience is worth a review. This was our first time in Bali and the tour we did with Bali Traditional Tours was the first tour we did in Bali. Let's just say that this set the bar real high for all the other private tours we did. We believe that Gus was definitely the major highlight of our experience. He is extremely enthusiastic, friendly, he is very fluent in English, and above all he is a really genuine person. We learned a lot about the Balinese culture from Gus! He was always giving us mini lessons and pop quizzes which made the car rides really enjoyable. Throughout the rest of our trip we would always come across things that reminded us of Gus's lessons, which would always put a smile on our faces :). Also, they're great at making sure that we are able to get our photo taken at all the prime spots. We also had lunch at a small restaurant by the rice fields and the food was on point! Overall we had a very amazing and memorable experience, and we would 100% recommend Bali Traditional Tours to everyone! This is definitely the company you would want to book your tours with in Bali :)"

We did 2 day tours (Ubud / Monkey Forest day 1, hike through rice fields followed by lunch and spa day 2). The hiking was a bit more adventurous than we had anticipated (very muddy and high grass navigated thru), but made for excellent pictures and well deserved spa treatment afterwards. The spa was extremely clean and luxurious. The Ubud tour was also a very good overview of Ubud - we went to a Balinese silver shop (and purchased many gifts), waterfall, temple, Monkey Forest, had a luxurious lunch overlooking rice fields / in our own hut, and ended the day with a visit to Gusti's personal Balinese home. Great way to experience the cultural side of Bali, would definitely recommend and do again if have the opportunity to go back to Bali!"

I witnessed how hard the rice farmers had to work and since then I have tried not to waste even a grain of rice. It's definitely a great experience to have. A few things to know:1. Wear hiking shoes (I only had a pair of old converse on thinking it would be a easy hike). 2. Put bug spray on.3. This is a moderate difficulty hike."

I didn't realize until the day before and made the guide come all the way out to our hotel for no reason. I felt terrible about it but they were extremely nice and professional. They even let me reschedule for the next day and never made me feel worse about it. So thumbs up for the kindness and professionalism!For the actual tour, we did a custom tour (they are also very flexible) where we visited a Balinese market, tellalagang rice terrace, monkey forest, spa, and tanah lot for sunset. It was very very well done. Our guide, Made, made us feel comfortable right from the beginning because he is a very genuine and nice person. He truly just wants his clients to have a good time. Honestly, I wasn't very interested in going to a lot of the places during our tour (my wife wanted to go to most of these places) but Made made it a great and fun experience. He was also able to fulfill my desire to try Babi guling and had no problem with switching up the lunch destination. Also, he is very knowledgeable and I feel like I learned so much about Balinese culture from him.If you come to Bali, you should definitely experience the \"true\" Bali and not just the beaches and the resort. Bali Traditional Tours lets you experience so much in just one day, I highly recommend booking a tour with them."

We have spent a cheerful day with our guide Gusti, a very smart and knowledgable young man always with a lovely smile and considerate for all you need as a guest. He speak wonderful English as it is very easy for us as a non-native English speaker to understand. We had the Kintamani tour as our choice and found that the overall experience was worthy for our cost to this trip (which is not cheap though). Our trip started from visiting a local market in which you could feel the real sense of the daily life of Balinese people for their food and religion offering. Then during the visit of a local public primary school, you would be surrounded by those excited and crazy pupils and able to had a general idea of the education curriculum in Indonesia. The coming two temples, Pura Gunung Kawi (Cliff on the Mountain Temple) and Pura Tirta Empul (Spring Holly Water Temple) would brought you into the atmosphere of great history and sacred religion ceremony. The panorama view of Lake Batur and Mount Batur (active volcano) is more than astonishing. The Tegalalang Rice Terrace is worthy for spending longer time to explore. Not only for the view recognized by UNESCO in Heritage List, but also for the subak system and local organization in community who plays better role than government. In the end, you would be welcomed to visit the local residential Balinese house of their staff and learn more about residential architecture. BTW, it is worthy to consider their Ubud Traditional SPA, which is the No. 2 spa in Ubud in Tripadvisor, and we feel as the best spa experience in Bali so far. However, there is still some tips and reminders for you to pay attention in the trip: 1. For lunch, choose by yourself, NEVER FOREVER be led to the Indonesian buffet restaurant, called Tepi Danau, Rumah Makan, which is one of the worst food we ever have in Bali. Do not let the view of Lake Batur outside the eating table fools you - it is everywhere in that area in any restaurant, you can find much better one with less cost. 2. If you are an animal lover, DO NOT choose Luwak coffee. Your purchase is supporting animal cruelty on civets, who have been forced to swallow much more coffee than their need in the wild, and being kept in cages forever and teased for entertaining visitors even they are nocturnal animals. Save the time from this coffee shop for Tegalalang Rice Field. Overall, Bali Traditional Tour is very professional and worth to choose as day tour guide in Bali."

Thank you Gusti!The tour covered a lot of ground and we were going pretty much non stop from our 8am hotel pick up. This was not a bad thing by any means, as it meant we were able to view quite a bit of Ubud including the very interesting and beautiful Elephant Temple and visit some quality stores and artisans. Our lunch stop at Bebek Tebasari was also very picturesque. Our earlier start also enabled us to go to the Barong Dance in the morning, which is a must in order to learn a little more about Balinese spirituality and culture. Our final stop, visiting a Balinese house, provided further insight into the day to day way of life of the Balinese people and capped off a truly memorable and fascinating day.   "

He didn't simply drop us off at the temple to let us fend for ourselves. He took us through the whole process and helped us to complete all of the rituals before entering the holy water fountain area. Made was even so kind as to stop on the way to the temple and purchase offerings for us to leave at the temple because he knew that we would be charged the \"tourist price\" if we purchased them ourselves. Made was a safe driver and extremely friendly and helpful to my mom, who has great trouble walking and my elderly grandmother who was also with us on our visit. We loved Made so much we hired him to take us from Ubud to the Lovina area some days later.

He struck up a rapport with the kids instantly and laid out for us what the day had in store. \"Made\" spoke perfect english too!Our first stop was a local primary school where we met the children, had a laugh together and felt that connection with real life in Bali. The children gave us a few high fives and waved us off after about 30 minutes.We then stopped off at a village local wet market and 'Made' explained the way Bali life worked, took us to interesting stalls where we tried some local delights and learnt about the daily offerings made by every Balinese person. We then took in a coffee plantation, had an amazing organic lunch, walked through rice terraces and lastly we were invited into a local Balinese house. Here we met Grandam, some of the families children, said hello to some oinky friends out the back and learnt how life, love and ceremony all go hand in hand in Bali.This tour was perfect for us and I would highly recommend everyone try it out.

It's been 20 years since we'd been in Bali, so tailored a Day Tour with Bali Traditional Tours to reacquaint ourselves with this paradise.Our guide was Made who was so friendly and accommodating. We would tell him what we wanted and he would be able fit it in, with no fuss.Highlights for us were eating super-fresh durian at the coffee plantation overlooking the gorgeous greenery; visiting Made's family home and just spending time to chat. Besides revisiting our old haunts we thoroughly enjoyed our time with Made.It was a long day and long drive but totally worth it and totally enjoyable."

It was a great way to get acquainted with Bali and learn about the culture. Our guide was Ketut and he was so great! He spoke English very well and explained everything as we went. He took us to a family compound, traditional market, Taman Ayun temple, Coffee Plantation, Jatiluwih Rice Terraces, and Tanah Lot Temple for sunset. We really enjoyed our time on the tour and getting to know Ketut. He was so friendly and fun to talk to."

I found the Bali Traditional Tours in Trip advisor and I booked the \"Begudul Tour\" for the 13/04/2016. Oka Gusti came to my accomodation at time (I booked for 8 a.m.) by a big and beautiful car with air conditionner and water bottle. This guide is THE BEST GUIDE EVER !!! Very nice and funny, you can feel how much he likes his country and his culture. His english is also very good and easy to understand ! I learnt a lot about the balinese culture, religion, life, economy, food, ... And I also saw most of the interesting and beautiful places in Bali ! It was exactly what I expected for my short holidays in Bali. So thank you to Bali Traditional Tours and espacially \"Matur Suksama\" to Oka Gusti, the guide with the biggest heart !Good luck :)Lea"

Our tour started with the on time pick up from our hotel. Then we stopped at a weave shop and got to see the natives make bags, clothing, and other items. Next was a temple where we watched a traditional balinese performance. Before going to the rice terrace we stopped at a local market and took a quick tour into the shops the locals shopped at. Once we got to the rice terrace we had time to take pictures and also walked around it if we wanted to. Unfortunately for us was my girlfriend was not feeling well that day so we didn't walk in the rice fields and after the lunch we headed back to the hotel. the whole time Wi was amazing and caring. he was very attentive as he kept checking on her the the whole way back to our hotel. he even offered to take us to a pharmacy to pick up some medication if needed. although we didn't get to finish the tour and experience the amazing spa that I read about in other reviews I felt Bali Traditional Tours was great and well worth it. highly recommend."

Our tour guide was Wi and he was the best, we were picked up at our hotel on time and started our tour with Wi trying to teach us a few key phrases of the Balinese language and a regular day in Bali life, the types of food they like to eat and about his family he loves his life and job and it shows in his enthusiasm showing us all the sites of the area.Our tour consisted of visiting 2temples, coffee plantation, weaving shops , silver shop, woodcarving and lunch in the rice terraces, a traditional Balinese home and ended with a massage at the spa. Let me start with the temples what an amazing experience to get a glimpse in their belief of the temples it was so pretty and Wi was great explaining the history of the temples. Next was the shops we visited and to see how the products are made, the coffee plantation was beautiful all the plants are beautiful and it was interesting to learn and see how coffee is made and the tasting at the end of the tour was great to be able to sample all the different types of coffees. Lunch was at a amazing place food was good and the view was amazing we were very high up in the jungle looking over the rice terraces. Next we were on to the spa , what a great experience the area was beautiful and the massage was great after was our ride back to the hotel we were sad that the day had come to an end but we have great memories.Hopefully we will visit Bali again and have Wi show us the surf spots.Disappointing to read negative comments about this company after spending the day with them what a great tour company very professional, accommodating to what we wanted to see on the tour, never rushed us at any of the stops, no problems with communicating speaks English fluently. We would recommended this company to anybody who is traveling to Bali a must do.Congratulations Wi on the new addition to your family, you are a great person maybe on our next tour we can visit your family.Terima Kasich, til kunjungan berikutnya "

            "review": "Great Balinese hospitality from this family business . We booked two day tours early in our 2-week trip to Bali and discovered so much about Balinese culture and history from our knowledgeable and kind host/tour guide/driver Ketut (which we found out means 4th-born). We did the trekking and spa tour on Day 1 and the shopping and spa tour on Day 2. Both days were really fun and Ketut's English is so good that we couldn't help but keep talking to him all day in the car! The trekking day involves trekking through the rice fields and some jungle areas - we were lucky as it had been dry but make sure you wear suitable shoes. If it has been raining, you have young children or are not sure-footed, request the easy trek which is less adventurous but perhaps safer as it is paved rather than jumping over streams and climbing up river banks! The shopping tour involved visiting various craft villages in the Ubud area and there is no obligation to buy but you genuinely want to support local trade so bring your credit card, especially for the silver and wood handicrafts. On both days, we went to the Ubua Traditional Spa run by Ketut's cousin and the staff were so friendly and the massages just what we needed. We enjoyed it so much that we returned later in our trip to have the Royal Ubud massage (2 therapists each). The tours were also flexible and we paid extra to go to the temple Tan Ah Lot for the sunset on one day, with Ketut also helping us to buy some local goodies from a night market. Overall, we really appreciated the heart that goes into this family business and by learning about the Balinese customs, temples and traditions, we felt that we really understood the island much better, as well as meeting some genuinely kind local people. Suksma - thank you, Ketut!"

I was on my first ever solo trip in Bali and after spending 4 days in Seminyak, i decided to take up a day tour and end my trip in Ubud as my next destination. We began at 9 am and Made, the most wonderful tour guide you could get, welcomed me at my hotel lobby with an extremely warm smile. I was slightly worried about being on my own but Made makes you feel extremely comfortable! I took up the Kintamani tour and our drive to the first destination was quite far off but not for a minute was i bored or quiet in the car! Made is a great conversationalist and taught me so much about their culture and ways of life that apart from the touristy places we visited, I learned the most about Bali during my Kintamani tour with him!We first went to a holy water temple followed by lunch at the Kintamani volcano and then great coffee at the coffee plantations! We were at our own pace and even though we covered so much, it wasn't rushed at all. We end the tour with a visit to a Balinese house where I met with Made's maternal grandparents and cousins. The house was beautiful and spending a day with Made and Bali traditional tours was one of my best decisions of the trip! A must do! :)"

It was the first time my partner and I had visited Bali and I made sure that this was the first review I would write about during our stay in this amazing part of Indonesia. I had read reviews about 'Bali Traditional Tours' and saw how many people had raved about them, which made me decide to book a Bedugul Tour with this company. This was a full day tour which involved visiting the Bali markets, the Royal Temple, Coffee Plantation, Jatiluwah rice terraces and finally the Ulun Danu Bratan temple in Tabanan. We were promptly picked up by Madeh (apologies if I had spelled that wrong!) from our resort and escorted to our car for the day. As soon as we met him, there was just an aura of joy and excitement with him that made us immediately feel very comfortable. Throughout the tour, Madeh was very informative, descriptive and helpful. He answered all the questions we had about the Balinese culture and filled in a lot of the gaps in our knowledge of it. He allowed us to try some of the fruits of Bali, e.g. Mangosteen and snake skin fruit, which were both in season and very sweet. We tried different Balinese desserts as well during our trip to the market, which gave us some much needed sugar for the day. He adhered to my request of trying some 'warung' food, which had 'Babi Guling' (suckling pig) and it was delicious! Our visit to the temples as well as the rice terraces were very memorable and he even took photos for us along the way. (Madeh takes very good photos by the way, making each one look almost like a postcard. Ha!). We got back to the hotel at around 6pm and before we paid, we even requested if he could drop us off at a specific beach so we could watch the sunset, which he gladly agreed to do so. It was hands-down, THE BEST tour I have been on, and Madeh made it such an enjoyable trip, that I just had to write a rave review like all the others. You cannot go wrong with picking this company for any of their tours. They really want you to experience the best of Bali as best as they can. I will definitely book with them again when we return."

As we wanted to go to a good restaurant, besides the typical tourist restaurants on the second day, he recommended a organic restaurant next to the Kintamani Volcano. He's a very good listener, bcs we mentioned \"local and organic\" just once and that was actually the day before. Also you want to go shopping in the places were the true local people do that? Just ask him, he can get you there! Result: Next time Bali and especially Ubud is nothing without him! Thank you Made for the wonderful 2 days!"

It wasn't just the places we went but the personal touch that he added to the day.The day started at the local market with all of the Balinese getting their provisions for the day. There we were able to taste a mangosteen and a sweet treat made from rice flour and coconut. Both were delicious. We were also able to meet some of the local sellers. Very kind people.From there we visited woodcarving, silversmith, and batik shops. I always love purchasing beautiful pieces from the Balinese artisians and today did not disappoint! In between shops Nyoman answered our many, many questions and joked around with us. He was also very interested in our lives. Lunch was at a restaurant over looking the beautiful rice terraces. Absolutley breathtaking. Not only was the view spectacular but the food was delcious as well. Everyone enjoyed their meal but the real highlight was the black rice pudding for dessert.During our conversations we talked about Lewak coffee because some of our group hadn't tried it before. Nyoman made sure that he added a stop to the coffee plantation to our day so we could try it. This was a huge bonus because not only were the coffee and tea samples delicious but the view there was more spectacular than at the restaurant!Off we went to his family spa called Ubud Traditional Spa. We each had the Royal Ubud Massage. There are no words to describe how amazing this was. It was a 4 hand massage for 90 minutes. It went way too fast! It was hands down one of the best massages I've ever had.At this point we were 2 hours over but Nyoman was kind enough to take us to his family home so we could see it. We were so blessed to be able to meet his parents, uncles, brothers, wife, and kids and see how they live. They could not have been more gracious considering it was 8:00pm.I can not say enough about Nyoman and his family business. If you are considering any type of tour please consider using Bali Traditional Tours. Not only are they excellent tour guides, but they are good people too."

Mom was not feeling great that day and it was raining. But our new friend, our tour guide Gusti turned all those into a eye-openning, relaxing tour. Words cannot describe how happy I were with our tour of Ubud with Bali Traditional Tours. I have found them through Tripadvisor and feel they live up to the #1 rank. The package was very affordable and no sales trick. Gusti (Gus for short) was very caring and flexible, informative, friendly and humorous. As a Chinese family, we had no problems communicating with him and we liked his stories of Bali. We learned much about the culture and people of Bali. Gus had definitely made a difference in our tour and it was definitely the highlight of our short trip. Thanks Bali Traditional Tours! Will definitely choose them again next time in Bali."

            "review": "A truly wonderful day - you must book!. I am so very glad we booked this tour. We did a lot of wonderful things in Bali but this was my favourite. Our driver was the wonderful Ketut who was so kind and polite and knowledgeable. He taught us so much about the beautiful people of Indonesia their culture and traditions. Ketut holds the traditions of Ubud and his village very close to his heart and he shared much of this with us. We asked him many, many questions as he answered so well. I feel so much richer for the experience. We booked on the full day Ubud & Environs tour but Ketut allowed us to change bits and pieces of it to cater to exactly what we wanted to do as we had seen a few places on the tour already. They are very flexible with your requirements. The day was brilliant and topped off by going to see where and how he lives. We also met some of his family including his adorable niece and Nephew of whom he is very proud. On top of all this his car is immaculate and he is a wonderful and very safe driver. In addition they also do transfers and it was MUCH cheaper than our hotel so we also booked him to take us from Ubud to Seminyak. This way we could also ask him more questions! I was really sad to say goodbye to him and hope to see him again someday soon! In addition his family also own the Ubud Traditional Spa which you can incorporate into your tour. I highly reccommend this also. It is stunning and the staff are so lovely and courteous. It is one of the best I have been to. The whole family are the most wonderful people and you too will be glad you met them. You really must book."

He was very professional, a good driver as well as guide, and didn't mind that I stopped to take a million pictures.

            "review": "An Incredible and Authentic Balinese Tour Company. My husband and I were looking for a tour that was going to show us the \"real\" Bali, not \"tourist\" Bali.I found Bali Traditional Tours online and was immediately drawn to the \"Volcano, Lunch and Spa\" full day tour.Our Tour Guide, Gusti, picked us up from the Resort at 9am and our journey began. Before I continue with my review, I have to talk about Gusti. This lovely young man was incredible. His English is very good and he spent the whole day educating my husband and I on life in Bali. We learnt about the caste system, religion, the Balinese way of living and the education system. The passion Gusti displays for his job and the love he has for the culture and people of Bali was so infectious that I was almost ready to pack up my life in Australia and move to Bali by the end of the tour!!Thank you Gusti, for being the most professional, passionate and gracious tour guide I think I have ever met on my travels over the years.Our first stop was to a traditional market place where the Balinese buy their food. This was an incredible experience. We learnt so much about the shopping habits of the Balinese from Gusti. We were the only tourists in this particular, traditional, Balinese village and it felt good to experience the 'real' Bali.Our next stop was to Pura Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple where we witnessed both Balinese and tourists bathing in the holy waters to cleanse and purify themselves. Witnessing this bathing ritual was incredible, as was Gusti's stories about how the spring waters came into existence.We then went to have a beautiful lunch in Tegallalang Village overlooking rice fields. The restaurant served very nice food and it was a very peaceful spot for lunch. When we arrived it started raining and this just made our lunch experience even better as we sat on a lovely verandah looking down over rice fields amongst the mist of the rain.Our next stop was a visit to a coffee plantation. We really enjoyed this. We got to taste test lots of different teas and coffees and were educated on the process of making coffee. The plantation was beautiful, feeling like you were a milion miles away in a heavily, vegetated, tropical forest!! We did try the Luwack Coffee and in terms of taste, I found it very comparable to greek or turkish coffee.We then headed to Kintamani Village to view the volcanoes and Lake Batur. Another breathtaking experience, with Gusti discussing the history of the volcanoes and the village.Our next stop was to a Balinese compound to observe how Balinese people live. I was fascinated by this and to be honest, it was this part of the tour that was my sole reason for booking. To be able to walk into a compound and see how the Balinese construct their homes and temples for their extended family members was truly fascinating.Our final stop was to Ubud Traditional Day Spa. What a perfect way to end the day. I have already written a separate review for this Day Spa and I must say, I was seriously impressed with both the quality of massage and quality of facilities.Feeling relaxed and fabulous, it was time for Gusti to drive us back to Legian. I am so pleased to have taken this tour and even more pleased to have been in the company of Gusti who has enriched our lives through the teachings of the Balinese culture and way of life."

My Mum and I took a one day Tamah Lot tour with Bali Traditional Tours in January 2016.We very much enjoyed our day with Asana our guide. We asked to be collected in Sanur (from the Nusa Lembongan boat dock) and dropped at a hotel in Ubud. The company accommodated this and our guide Asana was waiting for us when we got off the boat. We felt it was efficient way to avoid losing a day in transit.Asana was friendly, courteous, and taught us lots about Balinese culture and family life. The car was clean and comfortable.We enjoyed the visit to the Tamah Lot temple and the Royal Palace. The highlight was visiting Asana's home, where we met his sister in law. The Balinese live in large family groups and dedicate a large area of their homes to shrines, very different from the Western way of life.The only part of the tour I did not enjoy was the visit to the coffee plantation. After our \"free tasting\" we got a very hard-sell and the products were extremely expensive. I told the tour operator and they said they would visit different coffee plantations in the the future.We were very tired at the end of the tour. They are by their very nature road trips, and the Bali has fairly heavy traffic so there was a lot of time on the road. It was definitely a very worthwhile day."

They were flexible on making a slight change to the Kintamani Tour itinerary so that my friend whose first trip to Bali, included a trip into the plantation to try the Luwak coffee. Our guide Gus (Gusti) was punctual for our 9am pickup, and we spent our day in safe hands through the long drives to/fro our hotel which was important seeing that some folks had their own rules on the road :) Gus spoke great English, articulated the history of the attractions really well, and immersed us into local culture at the markets and a traditional Balinese family home. The hike back up from the UNESCO-site Gunung Kawi Temple wasn't as pleasant under the midday heat but he was incredibly encouraging and constantly checked to ensure I was feeling okay thereafter. The only bad bits were the bumpy roads and the scorching heat but it wasn't so bad with Gus' jokes :) I would highly recommend this tour and guide."

Made finished off the day with a visit to his family compound to show us a traditional Balinese home - all done with such ease and grace and happily answering our endless questions - all in all a lovely experience.

We learned so much about the predominant Bali Hindu culture, food and saw some marvellous sites. Often there were tourists who would also stop and listen while Ketut spoke. You are well looked after, these are easy going tours, although the waterfall in Ubud had a bunch of steps which was hard going for our legs that were worn out by white water rafting on a different tour (different company). Ketut takes some excellent photographs with your camera, and patiently waits while my shutterbug wife and I exhaustively snap images of the photogenic sites.We were based near Tanah Lot so there was a small additional charge for the pick up. Ketut was happy to negotiate a reasonable starting time.If you do Ubud then I would highly recommend doing the associated Ubud Traditional Massage in the evening."

He was also very accommodating if we decided we wanted to see something else instead of what was on our set schedule, which was great.

Our second day started well and we saw the Royal Temple and Palace. Then en route to Bedugul we stopped at the rice terraces for lunch. Unfortunately , my wife slipped in the rice fields, fractured her ankle and this effectively ended our planned holiday just 6 days in. She needed a wheelchair and we had to cut short our holiday so missed Vietnam and the jungle in Borneo. It was very difficult to get around and impossible to visit much of what we had hoped to see. A cautionary note-Take care if it is wet and slippery."

Booking was easy, and we chose the Tanah Lot and Rice Terrace Tour. Payment was to be in $US, to our driver, at the end of the day. Our tour guide was Gusti (Gus) whose English was better than ours. Gus was young, personable and obviously loved his country. He was waiting at the cruise port and took us straight to his car. We visited peaceful temples, a busy market and green countryside, on our way to the incredible UNESCO heritage rice terrace. This bowl-shaped area is huge and beautiful, producing most of Bali's rice crop.Gus took us to a local restaurant for a traditional lunch and we then walked thru the terrace, where we saw farmers working the fields - as he expects to do when he is older and works on his family's small farm. We drove on to the climax of the tour - the amazing Tanah Lot Temple. This temple is built in the sea, just off a beach with stunning views of the sunset. We parked up and walked thru a shopping area full of tourist stuff to reach the temple and its small counterpart,built on the rocks above the cove. An incredible feat of architecture, it dominates the entire area and would be worth the trip on its own.We finally got back to the ship almost 12 hours after we left - tired but happy. I would recommend this company to anyone wanting a top day and great value for money. If you get Gus to drive you, you really are on a winner."

He is an exceptional guide who we can now call a friend. We signed up for the Shopping and Spa Tour with hopes of having help finding meaningful gifts for ourselves, friends and family. Well...We got so much more than just a guided tour.Gusti started the day by taking us to a local market in a nearby village. We got to see how and what the Balinese purchase on a daily basis. Gusti even bought us some Snake Fruit to try. We visited a wood carving center, an Art Gallery with hundreds of paintings and,a Jewelry Store and a Batik store. We happily purchases items from each store as we felt comfortable with the prices and quality of our purchases.We had lunch at a hidden little restaurant overlooking the Tegalalang Rice Terraces. It was pleasant and relaxing stop with a lovely view of the terraces. We enjoyed a great couples Message at Ubud Traditional Spa (see my review of Spa itself) before heading back to our hotel.The most amazing part of our day came early in our day for when Gusti took us to visits his family home. My husband and I both studied Cultural Anthropology and were eager to see how Indonesians live. Gusti's family compound is nothing like our home In the USA. During our visit we met several family members including his wife, two little girls, a cousin and his Grandparents. We left feeling very guilty about how spoiled and lucky we are to live the way we do.Our tour was supposed to end about 4:30 but we did not arrive back at our hotel until almost 6:30. No extra costs was incurred even though we were late due the time we spent shopping. The tour service has comfortable air conditioned vans but the most important aspect of the tour was Gusti.Ubud Traditional Tours also picked us up at Benoa Cruise Terminal and dropped us off at the International Airport in Denpasar. It was easy and convenient booking with them on-line and were fully satisfied with the tour and price. You can send them email for information for your tour. We hope you book with them and please say Hello to Gusti for us."

Then a tour through a traditional Bali family compound. Followed by an incredible massage experience at their spa.

It was my first trip to Bali with my friend, and we booked the tanah lot tour for our first day in Ubud after seeing all the fantastic reviews on TripAdviser. It was definitely a great start to our trip in Bali! Made was our tour guide for the day - he arrived promptly, provided us mineral water & umbrella, making sure we were well taken care of throughout the tour - excellent service! He brought us to the local ubud market on the first stop & explained to us the Balinese culture, their religion, daily life and practices which was tremendously enriching and fascinating to learn. I was particularly intrigued by their Balinese names (they have only 4 names based on their birth order) & their daily offerings.. They count their blessings & give thanks every single day! Next we visited the coffee plantation, where we tried some teas & the famous Cat-poop-cino as said by Made (kopi Luwak) which was interesting..! We went on to visit a temple, rice paddies and tanah lot. The grilled corn at tanah lot is really good! It's been raining the entire day so we didn't get to see the rice paddies due to the fog as well as the sunset at Tanah Lot.. Made felt really apologetic about it but well, he can't control the weather! Despite all, he did make the entire tour an extremely memorable and fun one doing the best he can.. Made is knowledgeable, professional, humorous and passionate - the best tour guide you can ever ask for! By the end of the tour, Made turned into our new found friend :) the best part of the trip is visiting Made's house to really see how the local Balinese live - you don't get this kind of unique experience from any other tour! If you ever visit Bali, this is the tour you won't want to miss! I would highly recommend this tour to everyone, the experience is totally worth it! Just make sure to visit Bali on a dry season to catch the sunset and rice paddies in perfect view. AMAZING & OUTSTANDING TOUR, thank you Made!!"

Further, we were disappointed when our guide dropped us at a \"local\" restaurant filled only with Westerners and an outrageously expensive menu (by Bali standards). This was not the authentic experience we had hoped.However, the trip was redeemed by a trip to the massive Goa Gajah temple, Tegenungan waterfall, a stop at the Monkey forest and tour of a local family compound. In summary, the guide was fantastic and our only complaint is the tour felt like a forced shopping event instead of a cultural experience."

He was a great driver, came prepared with sarongs, umbrellas and water for us. He not only kept us entertained and laughing, his explanations of Balinese culture and the significance of the sights we stopped at to the Balinese people were so interesting. We learned and saw so much in just one day - it's a must-do if you want to see and understand the true Bali! Ending with a one hour included massage at the spa was the icing on the cake!"

Lots of local produce, spices and grains. Next stop was Gunung Kawi Temple. Gusti was prepared with Sarongs for both of us. We had a traditional lunch overlooking a volcano, visited a coffee plantation, another temple, rice terraces and a traditional Balinese home. I can't say enough about how great Gusti was.

He made sure we understood every concept he was explaining and was always answering all of our questions or requests before we could even formulate them.Bali traditional tours was able to accommodate us by substituting one standard activity we had already done by another one of our choice.Gusti speaks a very good English, which allows him to go into great depth when explaining the Balinese culture and its intricacies.During the day, we visited a food market and a primary school. We also visited Gusti's home (which, by the way for those like me who didn't know a lot about the Balinese culture, was a great experience and is nothing like a westerner would expect a home to be), the Tegallalang rice terrasses, the Monkey forest, the mount and Lake Batur and two temples protected by UNESCO. All of this in a nice and clean SUV with air conditioning.Definitely the tour to do if you want to know more about the Balinese culture and spend a great day visiting beautiful places!- Charles & Valerie"

Our first trip was with Gusti who took us on the Bedugul tour, which included a visit to his very own house compound which was really interesting. Having a guide was perfect for us as we got some much interesting information from Gusti, at the same time as being taken round to the key parts of each temple we visited. Our second tour a few days later was the South Bali and Ulu Watu tour which was modified for us, as there is over lap with the Bedugul tour, and we were also able to be combine the tour with a transfer to our next hotel at no extra cost. Ketut was our guide for a second tour, who suggested getting us to Ulu Watu in time for the Balinese dance performance, which was a great recommendation as the show was a highlight of our Bali trip! These tours really enhanced our visit to Bali, it wouldn't have been the same without them. As an additional bonus, both guides were very enthusiastic about taking photos of us as all the key sites on the tour, which meant we have lots of photos of both of us - which is a rarity for holiday photos!

After this we visited a coffee and spice plantation, where we tried a variety of amazing tasting coffee including Luwak coffee (from Wild Luwak) and Nyoman explained all of the spices to us and their different properties. Lastly we drove through the rice fields (amazing scenery) to Nyoman's village. Here we were invited into his house, we met his beautiful family and felt very welcomed into his lovely home. This was an experience unparalleled to any other. We learned so much about the rich culture of the Balinese and are forever thankful. I cannot recommend this company enough. The day was informative, beautiful, enriching, and Nyoman was great company. The experience with Bali Traditional tours is truly invaluable."

We went on the 1-day trip that included visiting the local market, a Balinese house, a school, a coffee plantation, the Royal Temple, Jatiluwih and Tanah Lot. It was an amazing day thanks to our great guide, Mad\u00e9. He picked us up at our hotel in the morning after which we visited a local market (not that special), he showed us his beautiful house in which he lives with 3 generations of his family and we also popped by a local school where we could check out the classrooms and take photos with the students. Afterwards we stopped by the Royal Temple, a religious center for the locals. Mad\u00e9 gave us great explanations throughout the whole trip regarding the history and religion of the Balinese people, including the description of all the gods, ceremonies, customs. We also visited a coffee plantation where they showed us civets, introduced how the famous coffee, Luwak is prepared and we could also try several kinds of local teas, cocoas and coffees, including the Luwak. Then, we visited the ricefields of Jatiluwih where we also had lunch. Suggest your guide to take the longer path when trekking on the fields, and tell him to drive you through the ricefields themselves, it definitely worth the experience and the view! We also recommend to start your trip later so that you could enjoy the spectacular sunset at Tanah Lot. Go to one of the bars on the hill, order a coconut / beer and just enjoy! Mad\u00e9 was an amazing guide: he was really friendly, funny and had a very good command of English."

We chose to do the Bedugal tour, and our tour guide was the wonderful Made.My wife had not been well for the couple of days previously and Made was very understanding and accommodating, tailoring the trip for us to avoid any major exertion. He was very informative about all of the sights and was more than happy to answer any questions about the attractions and Balinese life in general. At the end of the trip, Made took us to his home which was the best part of the day, seeing how a typical Baliense family lived was fascinating. In addition, his entire compound was built by his father and uncle, including the amazing and intricate hand carved stone temple. Made was a fantastic tour guide, so happy, positive and helpful. I'm not surprised Bali Traditional Tours are #1!"

We booked direct via the website. Very professional throughout including clear and regular confirmation/correspondence, prompt pick-up and the actual trip far exceeded our expectations. Katut was our guide (not full name but I lost his business card!) who was fantastic. He really tailored the trip to what we wanted to see (we did the Temple Tour) and presented the tour with the perfect blend of education and humour. You get bottled water provided and we had entrance fees and some sweets etc from a local market thrown into the price (approx. \u00a340 each)\u2026which is extremely good value for what you get. We would recommend buying some snake skin fruit (Salk) if you go to a market \u2013 very sweet/tasty and very cheap! Also, if you go to a coffee farm it may not be the cheapest but the quality is so much better than elsewhere we found/purchased in Ubud market/shops and still much cheaper than if purchased in UK/Europe etc. We would recommend having a generous tip ready! These guys work hard! Our day was full 12 hours (8am to 8pm) plus approx. 2hrs to/from hotel (Nuca Dua) for our tour guide (Katut)."

Gusti was absolutely the best guide I could ask for. He is super kind and super open to rely to any questions, and gave me amazing insights about the real life of the real people on the Island. The day were perfectly organized and the trip was super comfortable in a new car with AC and a lot of water for the hot days. I cannot recommend enough this tour company! Bali offers many drivers in case you want only to be dropped on and off in places, but having the opportunity to learn so much about the culture is a real treat. Good job Bali traditional Tours!"

It puts things in perspective of how lucky we are in developed nations. I hope his idea of having a guest house on his property comes to reality because staying with his family would be a treat! The sights we saw were very touristy (which we wanted) but we also saw some less touristy ones. Where we stopped for lunch in Abud was very good and a everyplace was very inexpensive. He knows his history and could answer any question we threw at him. I would highly recommend these guys for a tour and our guide.

Bali traditional tours was exactly what i was looking for and much more!! Nyoman is a great tour guide and provided so much information about bali and the hindu culture. We felt very comfortable asking questions and Nyoman was very happy to answer and educate us. Our tour of Ubud begun with a visit to the market where Nyoman took us into areas where no other tourists were. We spoke to shop keepers and tried some coconut rice cake they eat as a treat. Following this we went to the hidden waterfall which was beautiful and beat my expectations and then on to the Goah Gajah temple where we learnt a lot about Hindu religion and were blessed by a keeper of the temple.Then we had a lovely lunch overlooking the rice fields before continuing on to see a traditional bali home. We were very surprised and humbled when we arrived at Nyoman's house and it was lovely to meet his family and see their way of life. Finally we went of to the monkey forest where we spent a bit of time wondering around all the different areas and feeding the monkey's. We could of continued the tour to a village and a coffee farm but unfortunately we had to head home.It was a fantastic day and well worth the money!Thank you Nyoman!!!"

We learned so much about the local Balinese culture and the spots we visited. The tour felt very tailored and we were able to stop anywhere we wanted along the way between destinations. Mede was also an awesome photographer! We highly recommend Bali Traditional Tours."

We did the southern Bali (Ulu Watu, Tanah Lot and tanah Ayun) tour and a modified version of the Ubud and Environs tour. We found the company to be very responsive and happy to modify the tour to meet our needs. In fact when the opportunity to see a rare ceremony that follows the Hindu calendar arose, the company called us and asked if we were interested in going. They then rearranged our schedule to ensure we saw everything on our agenda and the ceremony. Maday our tour guide was informative, good natured and a pleasure to spend time with. We thoroughly enjoyed our time with this company."

Of course he has a deep knowledge of the islands history and can explain fully what you are seeing and the cultural significance of the places you are visiting. My second visit to Bali and this time I did 3 tours with some customisation including getting to know Seminyak area, buying a sim card and finding a nearby ATM and laundry. Would recommend Bali Traditional Tours to all."

He was also happy to change our schedule so we could visit different places if we wanted to. He also has lots of great stories and anecdotes to share about Balinese village life and all the special customs and traditions which are followed. It was a great experience. We were really pleased to be able to visit his cousin's family compound and to meet members of the family. The company runs a very high quality and personalised spa service too. It would have been great to book a spa session there as we qualified for a discount, but unfortunately we didn't have time. Overall an amazing experience. We loved it and agreed that it was the best thing we did on our holiday. The highlight of our trip. Thanks Ketut and Bali Traditional Tours. "

            "review": "A wonderful cultural experience. I am only just now posting this review having taken a tour back in April 2014 (I wasn't able to select this with the automatic postings for Trip Advisor) I have to say that the day we spent with Nyoman was the highlight of our trip to Bali. We visited a school, coffee plantation, traditional market, two temples and then went back to Nyoman's home where we met his wife, twin children and other family members. The whole day was just wonderful from start to finish. We learnt so much about Balinese culture and Nyoman was so knowledgeable and had a wonderful sense of humour. He was also so patient with me being slow to walk up and down the steps to one of the temples. We enjoyed a fantastic lunch of the best fish I have ever eaten overlooking the Volcano. Whilst this was not included in the price of the tour (we also paid for Nyoman's lunch which was well deserved), everything else was including entrance fees, cold water etc. We actually had a tour a few days earlier organised by the hotel we were staying at and it just didn't compare to our tour with Nyoman. This tour was worth every penny, in fact I would say they are probably undercharging for what you pay. Do yourself a favour and book a tour with BTT - you won't regret it. We are visiting Bali again in September and plan to book another couple of days with BTT."

The museum was very interesting and Made explained everything to us clearly and was very informative. We then headed to the rice terraces at Jatiluwih. We had a little mishap with a flat tyre on the way but it fixed quickly and easily by the garage nearby. The view at Jatiluwih was spectacular. We had a quick lunch and a walk around before heading to Beratan Temple. This was very misty and cool at the time so worth taking a cardi. Beautiful setting although full of local tourist a lovely temple to visit. Then Made was kind enough to take us to his home and show us how a Balianese family lives. Overall one of best trips of our honeymoon and would definitely book again with this tour company if we came back to Bali."

Nyoman was gentlemanly and warm and felt like a close friend by the middle of the day. He shared personal stories that illustrated various aspects of Balinese culture, his own general knowledge of same and the sites we visited, and seemed to be just as excited to get to know us as we were to know him and our surroundings. There was never an ounce of pressure to do anything we did not wish to do, he simply presented options and they were all amazing. We honestly miss him months later despite having known him a matter of hours. We did many great things in Bali, but nothing offered the sweeping immersion into that place like Nyoman's friendly guidance. Could not recommend more highly."

Before I go into details, let me give you a quick summary. Don\u2019t waste your time trying to plan a tour on your own. Bali Traditional Tours are different, fun and unique. They will immerse you into their culture and answer all your questions. In our case, we had Kitut who was a great guide, a safe driver (hard to come by in Bali lol) and also a great photographer!We spent around 8 hours with Kitut. Our day started with a stop at a local market to learn about some Balinese traditions. We then drove to Taman Ayun temple followed by a stop at a local coffee plantation where we got to try more than 12 different teas and coffees and see the fields and learn about the famous Lewak coffee. We then headed to the Jatiluwih rice terrace where we also had lunch. Kitut then took us on a short hike through the rice fields to talk some more about Balinese traditions and farming. We then went to Pura Ulun Danu Bratan temple. Finally we finished the tour at his own house where he showed us how a traditional family build their housing compound and how they live.During the whole trip, we never felt rushed. Kitut was always polite, smiling, and provided answers to all our questions about Bali. When we asked him about pricing and how much we should pay for souvenirs he gave us good estimates that helped us negotiate and bargain with the shop owners. With time, we learnt that his estimates were good and honest and that he was in our favor. The price included all entry fees and water. All my communication with them were through emails and I was satisfied with the experience. They respond fast and well to all inquiries.If you want a unique and different tour, give them a try: You are guaranteed a fun time!P.S. Make sure to book ahead of time. They get very busy. I tried to book another trip at the end of the day and they were fully booked the following 3 days."

A huge factor in which made the trip so memorable were the tours that we booked through Bali Traditional Tours. First off, I was truly impressed by the excellent communication, flexibility, and professionalism of this company through our booking process. We spoke to several other companies and Bali Traditional Tours impressed us so much that we ended up booking 3 full days of tours with them! Let me just tell you that every penny that we spent was well worth it. Incredible value for the price!!! Our first tour was with Ketut for the Kintamani tour. This tour was breathtaking. We were speechless during the tour due to the amazing views that no words can describe. Ketut was incredible. Immediately after meeting him we felt so comfortable and knew we were going to have a great time. He was so engaged, interesting, funny, and his love for Bali is so apparent through his knowledge. This was our favorite tour in terms of sightseeing. Our second tour was with our new friend Ketut again. We started the day with River Rafting. So much fun!!! Will never forget the experience. I would do it again in a heartbeat. After River Rafting we had a nice lunch (included in the Rafting fee) then went on a tour of the Sacred Monkey Forest and the Tegunungan waterfall in Ubud. We truly appreciated how flexible Ketut was in taking us to destinations of our choice and the ability to personalize our tour. What a great day of exercise and my wife and I loved the Sacred Monkey Forest. It was definitely one of our favorite destinations. A monkey actually grabbed the water bottle in my hand and twisted open the cap and drank it. We were laughing all day. Our final tour was the South Bali tour with Made. Such a fun day! Made kept us laughing all day and we truly enjoyed our your with him. This happened to be our final day in Bali and due to this tour - we felt content that we saw much of what the beautiful Bali has to offer. Wonderful tour to visit the sacred temples. Our favorite part of this tour was definitely the Tanah Lot Temple and finishing the day with a magnificent sunset seafood dinner at Jimbaran Bay. Thank you so much Bali Traditional Tours. You made our Honeymoon incredible. We will definitely go on some more tours with your company when we return to Bali. I would HIGHLY recommend this company to anyone that wants to have a wonderful time in Bali."

The traditional Balinese house we visited turned out to be his family house where he introduced me to some family members and he showed me the especial way that houses should be built according to the culture.The tour certainly is not as cheap as others, because I took a tour with another company 2 days before this one, but you can tell the difference between a driver and a real tour guide.

The highlights were visits to a school, the rice fields and his home/compound. We did so much in one day! The day started at 8.30am from Nusa Dua and he returned us to our hotel around 7.30pm. It was a wonderful experience and we highly recommended this company. They deserve every success!"

Ketut is a proud local who genuinely wants to share the uniqueness of Bali to all. Eventhough we are from Malaysia where some customs can be similar, we still learnt a lot and did not get bored despite getting caught in intermittent traffic.Although the fee is a bit on the highside it does include tickets (random fee (?) that needs to be paid on certain roads) so it was worth it. Ketut was also very polite and accomodating to our preferences. Thanks again Ketut!! :)"

This is not our first trip to Bali and we have lived in SE Asia on and off for years, so we are quite capable of exploring on our own. However, after reading the TripAdvisor reviews we could not resist giving these tours a try. What a great experience! Our guide, Nyoman was not only fluent in English - often a loosely used term - he was willing to adjust to our schedule on the fly. We ended up hiring him for three separate days, and visited a wide variety of stunning and fascinating sites - temples, waterfalls, plantations, gardens, schools, markets, private homes - while he shared insights about his country's history, culture, civil systems, and deeply observed religion. Every tour was unique and completely customized. Nyoman is extremely knowledgeable, polite and has an absolutely delightful personality. There is simply no better way to experience the beautiful and captivating island of Bali."

We did two days around Ubud with a templeand artistic focus - the Barong dance (which costs 100k extra) was worth every penny. Between the school visit, temples and painting tours to the numerous extras tacked on as situations arose, this was a true highlight of our trip, if you are in Bali these guys (Ketut in particular) are worth every penny - enjoy :-)"

Myself and a friend booked into this tour quite last minute only 2 days previously and were getting email responses instantly with information, times and the itinerary. We had the pleasure of being driven by and spending the day with Nyoman, probably the nicest person we met on our entire trip to Bali. He was very flexible with time and where we wanted to go. The car was very comfortable with air con and in a country of mad drivers Nyoman was safe and sensible yet got us everywhere on time. While he had an array of knowledge of all the places we visited he also advised us of other features on our journey and gave us an understanding of historic Indonesia. At the end of our tour, Nyoman was kind enough to invite us into his family home where we got to see how a typical Indonesian household was run and also met some members of his equally kind and humble family.I honestly couldn't recommend this tour enough, we both felt very comfortable with Nyoman and would definitely want to try another tour with Bali Traditional Tours on our next trip again!"

When he arrived he made sure we knew what we were doing, where we were going and how well we were all day. When we got into the car he gave us all water and said if there is anything we need to let him know. He came along and carried things for us, made sure of the itinerary etc. We took with us walking shoes, hats and a backpack. The rest was a dream day. The second tour was even more closer to my heart. I like to experience what the people of Bali are doing and all about them. We went to temples and rice fields. We had an amazing lunch and ate with our tour guide which made us very happy. We had a fun very informative and amazing tour and tour guide. We will be using again before we go :)"

Wish we found out about them earlier as they were truly fantastic. We used other guides in the days before (some more expensive, some cheaper), and they were absolutely fine (don't think bad service really exists in Bali), but Bali Traditional Tours definitely provided that added value service and made the day extra special.Nyoman was our guide, and we really clicked with him; such a happy, accommodating and thoughtful person. And super attentive. He took us on a full day tour to see the south Bali temples, which included a stop-off tour of his village and his home on the way. We got to meet his family and see what it's like to live like a Balinese, truly insightful. We learnt so much from him on the day - the tour price includes entrance fees for us but also for him so he can accompany us inside the temples and attractions and introduce us to key features and answer all the questions we had! His attentiveness comes so naturally; always checking to see if we're okay, even running out to get us drinks when he thought we needed some. We highly recommend Nyoman as your guide. We were a little overwhelmed by the choice of other tours and tour companies available - when you walk through town (we stayed in Ubud) there are many shops and stalls offering drivers/guides, so it was difficult for us to make a decision on who to go with. We tried tours advertised in town and via our hotel too. Then finally a quick search on trip advisor led us to these guys - if we were to visit Bali again they will absolutely be our first choice. You can't go wrong with 350+ top reviews right? Right!"

We loved all the restaurants and shopping excursion. We especially enjoyed the suckling pig. Yummy.We have traveled all over the world and this was the best tour company and tour we have ever had.

It really amazes me that 350 reviews later, balitraditional tours is now number 1 in ubud and several hundred people felt the same way as i did.Our meeting this time was really like old friends and as i was travelling with a friend from japan to bali, it was probably the best introduction anyone can get of the real bali. We went up Mt Kitamani and had a mouth dropping view of the mountain and the expansive valley below and all at a humble cafe which served the most incredible indonesian local food. If you are a fan of coffee then you cannot leave bali without trying the local 'cat-poo-cino' otherwise known as kopi luwak or coffee made from the civet cat's poo poo. Nyoman took us to the local farm which cultivates the coffee from wild civet cats, he explained that unlike commercial farms which raise civet cats and feed them coffee beans and collect their poo for coffee, these local farms dont raise civet cats but rather let the animals roam around the coffee plants and they in turn will select the best coffee beans they like to snack on, which means their poo also contains the best coffee. I didnt quite understand the concept of why people will pay over $50 for a cup of kopi luwak until you taste it. So i learnt and got a better appreciation for this most exotic of coffees that morgan freeman told jack nicholson he should try as part of his bucket list.we explored ubud and made impromptu stops to watch a rare inter-village balinese dancing competition, it was noisy, colourful and lively and we really stood out as the only two tourist standing amidst the brightly dressed costumed dancers swaying their fingers and heads in rhythm to the balinese music.as some other reviewers had written, nyoman really loves his job and he may not have the opportunity to travel widely, the next best thing he can do is to bring the world literally into his home, he did that for us and brought us home to visit his entire family including a stop at his mother-in-law's bridal shop. It is worth a visit as you get treated to see how he looked like a royal balinese prince on his wedding day his picture is literally on the shop door.we went to a temple and we participated in a prayer ritual with him and he explained the meaning of purification and the placement of rice on the forehead for blessings.looking back on some of the things other reviewers said about nyoman, i can guarantee that you will be moved by his warm and friendly personality and as the saying goes, you meet as strangers but leave as firm friends. i do periodically read what others say about nyoman and ketut and can vouch that it is all true that they are an asset to bali's tourism sector. I know that everyone who has written on this forum do so without solicitation and their motivation is like mine, we feel a sense of gratitude to their hospitality and the best way to pay it forward is to spread their good work. I do believe that we have to put things in perspective criticism of their tour prices is most unfair, when you consider that you pay only one price for your entire entourage, so whether you are by yourself or with your family, you pay the same flat rate. Just be assured that all other commentors have shared that they eventually felt he deserved to be paid more than he charged, i havent found any other tour guide in bali or elsewhere that was so eager to show you his humble home and meet his extended family and even bring you to the nearby river where the local folks wash themselves.We will meet again and like him i share in his happiness reading every great review he gets."

Gusti was gracious enough to take us to visit his own family compound so we could see the lifestyle of a real Balinese family. We were very honored. The rice fields were picturesque they didn't even look real!! At the coffee plantation we were able to help make coffee and tasted a variety of teas & coffee. The Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple was magnificent to witness in person. We LOVED vising the local school, the kids are so cool!!The tour was all day but we had so much fun along the way it seemed like time flew by.

The day with him could not have been better...his knowledge as a native of the area (his family has lived on the same property for almost two hundred years!), his interest in learning about our lives and culture...his personal touch including taking us to his family compound was truly amazing! He took us to several places that we would never have known about and to any place that we asked him to take us. He was right on time picking us up (in his VERY nice new, clean, comfortable Toyota van) at our rental at 9am...returned us after 7pm that evening...all at the unbelievably low cost of $115 for the five of us. The end of the day at his family compound was truly the highlight. He lives there with 28 family members including his wife, twin four year olds, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. His in-laws were visiting...and they were all the most welcoming people we met our entire month of touring Southeast Asia. They even made special Bali treats for us to enjoy with tea under their community pavilion in the compound where several of them joined us to talk about the tradition of living together with extended family. To get to see and experience life in his home compound was amazing and get to see what beautiful people they are...was priceless. We felt so bad about what little he charged at the end of the day that we added an extra hundred dollars and some more for him to buy something for the beautiful twins...a boy and a girl....and Nyoman teared up. What a great guy! And what a memorable day. We took similar guided tours in every country we visited while in Southeast Asia...and all were great...but none held a candle to our day with Nyoman.

We have travelled extensively and had been to Bali before; but, the others hadn't, so we had an idea of what would provide a good overview in the day that we had available. The ship tours were in large bus groups and expensive, so we searched the iNet, were impressed by the reports on Bali Traditional Tours, especially the TripAdvisor reports which we use extensively as a benchmark, and made contact.The response was rapid, and with the teams assistance, we agreed a broad program and that we would be met at the port on arrival. This all worked perfectly. Nyoman was waiting for us at the port gates with a clear placard and we set off in his van, which was comfortable for the four of us. Nyoman proved to be an excellent guide and we had a most enjoyable day in which we saw many new items of interest, visited significant sites and, most importantly, were immersed in the culture and lifestyle of typical Balinese people. This included a visit to a typical local market and, more significantly, being taken to Nyoman's extended family home complex and having the lifestyle (domestic arrangements, religious involvement, garden and produce etc etc) explained to us.Nyoman did all of this most professionally, quietly and without drama. His English is excellent and his 'feel' for what we wished to achieve could not have been better. Finally, he is a patient and excellent driver and we had no 'dramas' which, anyone who has driven in SE Asia will recognise as a major bonus.Overall we had a great day, achieved all of our aims and could not recommend Nyoman and Bali Traditional Tours more highly. The record on TripAdvisor attests to this."

            "review": "outstanding but some advice. This is not a big tour company. It is two cousins who both run the company and act as the guides. So in busy times it may be wise to book in advance. In fact their email was playing up and it was our hotel who helped us get into contact. Although the pricing is in dollars, they take local currency which would have been quite helpful if UK Barclays Bank had not stopped both our debit cards. We had a superb day. In round terms the price was about \u00a350 for 2 (but the same price for 4), but did not include lunch, but that was just over \u00a35 each. For the best part of 9 hours that was great value. As it was a holiday, we started at a local's market not a school. It was fascinating, it was not very clean with mud everywhere, but was open 24 hours per day.Then the normal temples and sites etc. Our guide was superb. His english was excellent and very easy to understand and his knowledge far reaching. We finished at his 'home compound' which gaves us a real insight into how life would have for most people, before the move to cities. Both the cousins were taking tours that day - so try to be flexible on days, we think you will 'feel the difference\" Highly recommended."

We are a family of 4 (children aged 9 and 12) visiting Bali for the first time. We really wanted a tour with a guide who could teach us about traditions, customs and local landmarks. Ketut was always ready with facts and pop quizzes! and was accommodating of our interests (many thanks to the other reviewers on Trip Advisor who pointed us in the right direction). It is difficult to pick a highlight as it was all fantastic! Goa Gahja and the Monkey Forest were the best bits according to our children. Finishing off the day with a visit to Ketut's family compound was great, it was a privilege to be invited in.The tour is a full day with plenty of walking, so wear your walking shoes and bring your camera. Our day started at about 8.30 am and we were back at our villa by 6.30 pm.The cost is a little higher than other tour operators BUT it is worth it (and does include drinks and entry tickets). During the day I noticed people listening in to Ketut's commentary, he really knows his stuff! We would not hesitate to recommend Bali Traditional Tours."

Our guide spoke good English, had a great sense of humour and was constantly volunteering information that gave us a much better understanding of all the things we've seen in Bali. The cost was on the high side, but we thought it was worth it for the quality, having previously been disappointed by cheaper guides. In terms of the tour itself, we most enjoyed the trip to the school and the Gunung Kawi temple. We were underwhelmed by Kintamani village - it's very touristy and full of aggressive sellers. The view it offers of Batur lake and volcano is nice, but perhaps another vantage point can be found away from the chaos? We finished up at the Tegallalang rice terraces, where we had lunch - we ate at a restaurant recommended by our guide. The food was good and genuinely Indonesian, but the restaurant was clearly for tourists only and had several large groups, which didn't make for a great atmosphere. As a suggestion for future tours, perhaps the guide could have a couple of good restaurants up his sleeve to offer different options depending on what the customer feels like. On the whole, we had a great day out and would definitely do another tour with this company if we return to Bali."

It began with a trip to a traditional village and family compound where I was honored to meet my guide's beautiful family and learn about the structure of the family home. Next stop was the traditional village and a trip to Taman Ayun Temple where I learned soooooo much about the Hindu Buddha customs and traditions in Bali and happy to say I have met a new friend. Jatiluwih was incredibly beautiful and definitely a must see. And the final spot was Tanah Lot at sunset. I learned so much about Bali during my short time with my guide and every step of the way Gusti was wonderful at explaining customs, had interesting facts, and small trivia to keep me entertained all day. He spoke beautiful English, was very knowledgable, courteous and very, very funny. I am happy to say I went on this tour. Would book again in a heartbeat."

Ketut really knows his Bali and is so incredibly proud of it. He took us to amazing temples and beautiful locations. He went to a great deal of trouble to explain Balinese Hindu customs and how the temples worked and what all the different places and offerings meant. He really brought the religion to life for us. It was so wonderful to learn about a culture so incredibly different to our own. Everywhere we went, Ketut seemed to know the right place to stop, to take photos, to eat as well as telling us the history of Bali (both recent and ancient) and modern customs and mores. Both days we went to the most amazing places for lunch. I heartily recommend that you take Ketut's recommendation on what to eat. On the first day we were in a beautiful restaurant location overlooking the volcano and lake. Ketut suggested the fish. It was the most beautifully cooked fresh fish I've ever eaten. Melt in your mouth. On the second day we were in another amazing location (overlooking rice paddies) and Ketut recommended the Balinese buffet. Again, we weren't disappointed. It was a chance to try a little of everything. Again, the food was delicious and fresh. The temples we went to were amazing, scenic and beautiful, but you can read about them on other websites. This is all about Ketut and his amazing service. We didn't expect the traffic in Bali to be so horrific. It was great to have Ketut drive us around. He was so funny and full of conversation we didn't notice the traffic jams. His English is impeccable. We had such a good time, we engaged Ketut for a further day. We had booked to have dinner at Mozaic restaurant in Ubud. He collected us from our hotel in Legian, drove us up to Ubud slowly. We stopped on the way at a Batik factory, some silversmith shops and a wood carving factory (all prearranged) we then had some time to walk around Ubud and get a flavour of that town. Ketut kindly took us back to his home so we could get changed into our fancy clothes for dinner and then drove us to the restaurant. After dinner he drove us all the way back home again. It was great. He did all this for us in and around his family commitments and telling us about his commitments in his village for the Balinese festival that was happening, as well as his friend's wedding. It was great to hear all about local Balinese life. Ketut himself is getting married in 2015 and was telling us all about the wedding preparations for his own wedding. We wish him and his bride so much happiness. It is often said that the Balinese people are the friendliest people on earth. This is true and Ketut must be the friendliest Balinese on the island. Everything was perfect, he was punctual, reliable, reassuring, the car was clean and cool, there was bottled water aplenty and for the service, the price was ridiculously reasonable. Would not hesitate to recommend him. When we are next in Bali we will definitely ask Ketut to take us out again. Thatnks Ketut, you are a legend."

It is so much more interesting to visit temples and markets when someone can tell you the history and meaning of everything. A big bonus to meet his family in their traditional balinese household.

A long day, excellent value and an experience we will never forget."

We didn't want to do one of their set tours (some things we had seen before and didn't want to revisit, and we were finishing at the airport in the afternoon), so we worked out a plan which included sightseeing and shopping and lunch. Ketut showed us a glimpse of life in Bali, supported by lots of information about religious and cultural factors. He was an excellent guide with a great sense of humour, great knowledge, and great patience (helping to find something I was shopping for in many places). He chose a perfect place for us to have lunch, and he got us to the airport at just the right time to catch our flight. We saw and learned such a lot in one day that we could not have done without Ketut's expertise. Totally recommend this company for Bali tours."

On the second day afternoon, we visited volcano, another coffee plantation for a cup of coffee, rice terrace and Holy Spring temple. Sounds like too many places to visit in 1.5 days but we did it without problems. Everything was smooth and comfortable. We truly enjoyed spending time with Nyoman. He was a great guide the entire time. Very personable, honest and fun. My 9-year-old daughter loved his Balinese children's songs he sang for her. Thanks to Nyoman we had a great time in Ubud. We strongly recommend Nyoman as your guide for your future trip to Ubud. Nobuko"

My time in Bali was short, at the end of a business trip, so I was staying in Kuta in proximity to the airport. VERY glad that I made these arrangements to experience a bit of the real Bali. My tour guide, Gusti, arrived at my hotel a bit later than agreed upon due to a miscommunication in their office. No real problem and appreciated their desire to make this minor oversight right. I had arranged the \"Ubud and Environs\" tour. If I had it to do over again, I would have done a bit more research about exactly what I wanted to see, as the guide was very accommodating of my desires. While we made a brief stop at a batik factory and shop and a wood carving faculty and shop, I would probably have skipped both. There was absolutely no pressure to buy from my guide. We then toured several temples, the rice terraces, and some of the sites of Ubud. Gusti shared a lot of input about the Balinese context and culture in a way that was fascinating and personal. If I had it to do over again, I probably would have lingered just a bit longer in Ubud, as there were a lot of good shops and boutiques here. Really enjoyed the visit to the local vegetable market and the desire of the tour to give a real sense and some understanding of the local way of life. This was, overall, excellent and I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. Extremely fairly priced as well."

What I actually experienced during those 2 days of tours was truly awesome. The owner of the company Nyoman Grago conducts one on one tours in this company.

We talked most of the time we traveled together in his very comfortable vehicle about so many topics (many of which I asked about and he was most willing to talk about with great expertise) that I feel I have had a full college course on Bali. Nyoman is a most pleasant person who speaks excellent English and is very easy to talk with. He was flexible to changes in the actual tour that I requested and maximized the value of the tours. I would give him and his company the highest recommendation possible especially if you are tired of tours with groups and being taken to places to \"look at\" articles to buy that you were not aware was part of the tour you signed up for.

The students were eager to demonstrate their English skills and interact with us. We brought a world map and inflatable globe for the classroom and they were greatly appreciated. The students made us feel like rock stars! The rest of the day we toured temples, lakes, rice fields and more. Nyoman provided valuable background information on everything we were seeing, really bringing history to life for us. He also explained how the rice fields are planted, cared for and harvested. An unforgettable day from beginning to end."

There are not enough stars for this amazing tour!Our guide was Ketut, and the day with him was the highlight of our time in Bali (although every single day was absolutely magical).We spent around 7 hours together total, with our tour ending at his house!We did the Kintamami Tour, and there wasn't one thing I would change about it.I think they WAY undercharge for the service they give you, so we tipped an additional $20 USD.Simply amazing and highly recommend. Can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Ketut."

I won\u2019t even call it a \u201ctour\u201d because he made us feel like family. Before we even arrived, he was so flexible in customizing the tours via to suit our preferences. My husband and I spent two full days touring Bali with Nyoman and it was by far the highlight of our two week trip to Hong Kong and Bali. We have traveled a lot and taken many tours over the years and this was by far the best experience we have ever had on a trip.He was so patient with us and we learned so much about his amazing culture. He was such a gracious host and we even went to his home for coffee the second day and met his beautiful family. Some of our favorite parts of the experience were seeing the Jatiluwih, Sacred Ubud Monkey Forest, Tanah Lot Temple and Tirta Umpul Temple. We also loved the visit to the local school (we brought them some school supplies from home) and they were just adorable and so polite, even practicing their English with us. Nyoman is a truly incredible person and guide and I can\u2019t say enough about him and the wonderful experience these two days were. On top of being a friendly and amazing person, he speaks great English and is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about both the culture and history of everything we saw. We were truly immersed in the Balinese culture and couldn\u2019t have been happier with our experience. I feel like we have a friend on the other side of the world and hope to travel back to Bali one day!"

He is truly a wonderful guide with so much knowledge about the Balinese culture and the Hindu Celebrations. I would recommend his tours without hesitation, he is such a kind person and is more than happy to explain small details about what you are seeing (even when you ask twice!). The best thing about Nyoman is how passionate he is about his culture and how much he wants to share this with people from other places. I have been to Bali many, many times so tours are not something I am usually interested in but I will certainly take a full day one with him next time."

We haven't even finished our trip yet and as I am writing from our hotel in Sayan, I felt compelled to write a review to praise such an amazing and humble guide as Nyoman. We have just completed our second tour with Bali Traditional Tours and I must say these two days have been the best so far in our trip, and my feeling is is that it will stay that way.A true guide not only has impeccable knowledge of the culture and the locations visited, but he cares about his clients, who they are and how he can make their experience better. Nyoman does all these things and more. He never rushes you when you want to spend extra time ANYWHERE, and is always willing to customize his tour to suit your interests. If you want to stare at a boring temple for hours on end and that's what makes you happy, so be it. Nyoman will wait with you and try to think of as many stories or jokes to try to make your time more enjoyable. He is the true spirit of a GUIDE. Someone who reminds you of the itinerary, but never forces you to go somewhere just to keep a schedule. Its YOUR time, you can spend it how you want, and Nyoman is always aware of that. Just don't expect him to be able to make all the stops if you spend too much time at one place.After two days of spending time with Nyoman I can honestly say he is not only one of the best guides, but probably one of the best men I have ever met. For full day tours its customary for you to pay for the guides lunch, but Nyoman never expects it or pressures you. He is the epitome of a man with high character and great patience and care. He only expects the agreed upon price and never forces you to buy anything from the locations he stops at. His sole purpose is that you enjoy your time at Bali under his watch, and he is happy to show you his culture and religion that he so deeply respects and cherishes. You can't go wrong with this tour company, and if reading this review has taught you anything, its that Nyoman will show you much more than just landmarks and viewpoints."

We feel that in this one day, we got to see a little of everything, and we ended the day with a much better understanding of the culture and history of Bali.We visited a traditional market, the Taman Ayun temple, and a spice and fruit farm where we tried luwak coffee! We also trekked around the Tabanan rice terraces (tip: wear shoes with some tread if it looks like it might rain, as the terraces can be a bit slippery!) and ended the tour with a visit to the gorgeous Ulun Danu temple. Throughout all the sites, Ketut did a great job explaining details we would not have learned otherwise. Also, since our hotel was farther away in Nusa Dua, we spent a lot of time in the car. Ketut used the opportunity to teach us about various aspects of Balinese life and culture, and also enthusiastically answered all our random questions that came out of the conversation.All in all, our trip was very well planned. We learned a lot and had a lot of fun!"

We visited Tanah Lot, Coffee Luwak Plantation and Uluwatu.

Women in his family were busy preparing the offerings for a celebration of their family temple. I got to learn a little bit of making offerings too. He took us to a local restaurant to taste Babi Guling as we requested which was right next to the rice fields. Food was tasty and at a low price and the view amazing. My husband is also a tour guide in China so they also exchanged their opinions and experiences.Although it was only one day but we sure understood a lot more of Balinese culture during this tour. If I have another vacation to Bali, I would definitely book another tour from him to see more Bali!"

If you're inquisitive all your questions will be answered and we now feel we have a greater understanding of Balinese culture, family and religion. There are 3 guides in the business and you will get a different driver based on your language. These guys are a small company of friends so it feels good to support a local startup business. Ketuts English was great and we were able to joke around and have a laugh together.As it was Sunday we didn't visit the school so if that's a priority for you check your days! The traditional market was great to see and Ketut bought us a selection of Balinese fruits to try. All the stops were great and much better for getting explanations then if you just visited alone. My mum became a little unwell from the heat but Ketut was lovely and got her water etc and we slowed the pace to suit her.I will definitely be recommending this tour to friends and family, and trying out some of the other tours next visit to Bali!"

As a result, we concur with all previous reviews about the highest quality skills of Nyoman as a guide, and his company as a business. I recommend the early morning climb to the top of Gungung Batur to see the sunrise and spectacular views.The climb is a challenging walk up a steep path of lava stone and sand, done in the early hours of the morning using flashlights and a secondary mountain guide. This trip was additionally special because Nyoman had never made the summit before and I was very happy to have his company as we drank tea and watched the sun present itself. He was thoughtful enough to have packed a nice boxed breakfast to eat with our tea. Bali Traditional Tours deserves the highest ranking it has achieved on Trip Advisor!"

The coffee plantation was great, and the rice fields are not to be missed. We hiked throughout the fields and had an excellent lunch afterwards, one of the best I had in Bali. We go on a lot of tours when we travel and this one ranks very highly on our list. We hope to return one day!"

Ngurah was kind, humble and informative and he made both tours so enjoyable. I would highly recommend Bali Traditional Tours if you want to learn all about Bali, the culture, the language and the sites you are visiting. Ngurah shared with us knowledge about Bali, and was just as interested to hear about our own culture - it was such a good experience. I cannot explain just how incredible our two days were, I will definitely take another tour if I am lucky enough to go back to Bali. I would tell anyone going to Bali to get the best of your trip, take a day trip (or two) with Bali Traditional Tours!!!!!"

Nyoman is one of the nicest and most humble people I've met and he made the tour enjoyable as well as really informative. Nyoman was right on time at 9 am and he was extremely accommodative since we had a baby with us and didn't want the day to get too exhausting. We had booked the Kintamani tour so we visited The Holy spring temple, Balinese traditional market, coffee and tea plantation, Mount Batur, Telangana rice fields. Nyoman was so sweet that he took us to a halal restaurant on our request. At the end of the tour, he took us to his house compound to show us what a traditional balinese home is like. We also go to meet the family! It was really heartwarming how he treated us so well the entire day. Really glad to we got to experience the balinese culture so closely thanks to this amazing tour. We had such a great and comfortable experience that we requested Nyoman to take us to the Bali safari and Marine park as well.. SInce he was booked for the next day, he got his friend Ngura to take us instead and booked our package for the safari! Talk about being efficient and quick!! :D Nyoman and Ngura, thank you so much! Really looking forward to seeing you again!! :)"

The guides loved sharing their knowledge and our highlight was being welcomed on a visit to a traditional home. We will remember this forever. The tours (we took 2) were informative, fun and filled with special touches and knowledge that only a local could provide. Both our guides were polite, fun and above all trustworthy. The places they recommended to eat at during our tours were great. Thank you Nyoman for encouraging us to safely interact with the monkeys at the monkey forest, we were initially a bit apprehensive but all his tips made for a safe, fun time holding and feeding the monkeys. These guys are genuine and passionate about their business and well deserve to hold the number one spot for tours in Ubud."

You get what you give and the friendlessness and laughs were returned in volumes!Be confident that basics like on time, great information, well looked after, good constant attention to detail are simply a given. Even the most annoying and demanding tourists (u know who u are), I bet, would be looked after graciously. If you have a complaint with these guys, look deep, it's most likely your own fault :)We had a few tweaks to the package deal, emailed ahead to advise, but were conscious that deviating unreasonably was just stupid. These are well planned package deals that work for good reason! Yet we were accommodated beautifully. Our driver nicely talked us through how our requests would fit and then we were off!With great humor, good smiles and genuine fun a bigger Balinese world with interesting people was introduced to us :) A fun trick, say \"Hello\" to the touts b4 they get a chance to say \"$1\". You can have some fun and meet the real person behind the seller, for 2 minutes at least lol.After temples and food, lastly we visited a great area for painters and had more good times picking a nice piece we will always remember our day trip by.But that wasn't the end, even though we were at end time, our driver graciously took us to his village, introduced us locally, and we were able to watch (not do) a local village dance practice. Both being from dancing backgrounds chance to watch real choreographers was brilliant and perfect. We are now firm supporter's of panji kumara mas, Duta Gianyar. Good luck for 27th June competition! With reluctance, is was getting late and these guys have long enough days, we were taken 'home'. Even then a night market for some dinner was on our way so we ate with the locals and shared even more laughs.Big hugs and cash signaled the end of a more than fantastic day.Reputation is so very very well deserved I can almost not put it into words."

This is the first time that I booked a tour outside the hotel for no reason at all (it was more like destiny). I was reading reviews from TripAdvisor and found this tour company and another one which I was also considering to book with also with high ratings here. I emailed both companies on the same day and both replied at almost the same time. I picked this company by chance and I thank all the Gods in heaven that it led me to Ketut Mawa, my guide for 3 days in Bali. Ketut was really kind hearted, warm and sincere. He met me at the airport as I arrive from an early flight and went straight on the tours. He remembered the tours I wanted from the email exchange we had and was able to reconstruct the itinerary since some of the places would be repeating. He even went out of his way to find a shop that I was looking for and even called the number I found of the shop from the internet to figure out the way to get there. He also helped me look for something that I wanted to buy and even stopped at the shops to ask for it without me reminding him. And even if I told him that it was ok if we couldn't find one. Ketut happily shared his culture with me and we shared stories all throughout the car rides and tours. We compared our cultures and traditions, shared anecdotes of our own travels and I really felt that I made a lifelong friend here. I have never had a private guide as enthusiastic and as dedicated as Ketut and believe me, I had been on a lot of solo travels. Ketut made me feel that I was more with a friend than with a tour guide. He would even crack jokes along the way.Going through the temples, Ketut would share how their culture and beliefs are, and pointed out things that i wouldn't have really noticed as a tourist. He also told me that we could stop at any shop I wanted to and he even went with me to their local market (not the one where all tourist go). He showed me how and where the locals go to the market and go about their daily lives. Although I was not able to visit a school or their house, we were able to go thru a traditional Balinese compound in a restaurant where we stopped for lunch he explained every detail of the Balinese household and how they live. In one of our tours we went to the Tirta Empul Temple where he said I was very lucky to have seen a traditional ceremony in the temple which even he personally wasn't able to witness with all the years he's been going to the temple. He even went down the water with me and prepared the offerings for the Gods. I really appreciate him going out of his way to prepare everything and even help me find a decent place to get changed. And him coming from Ubud going to my hotel in Seminyak, he really has to wake up early to get there on time and never did I hear any complaints from him. Every reviews said here is true. This company is probably the best you'd ever book with in Bali. When we parted ways after 3 days of amazing tours, i felt like i was leaving a friend. And i promised Ketut that i would surely be back. And right now, I am already planning my next trip to Bali to see what I have missed the last time and I would most definitely book Ketut again as my guide."

We did the Kintamani and Bedugul tours with the addition of the Monkey Forest and highly recommend both of them.Ketut was so welcoming, knowledgeable about the history of all the sights and patient with my parents' limited mobility. He took particular care to assist them when climbing steps became a bit of a struggle. He was extremely caring and thoughtful in tailoring the tours to what my parents would be able to cope with.

It was a great choice afterall and if you are still searching, just go with this, you won't regret it.Our tour guide is Ketut who showed up on time in our hotel reception. Since we stayed in Nusa Dua area, it was quite some distance to the rice terrace and the temples. During our long rides, Ketut fed us with the Balinese culture, their customs and he spoke really good english! We visited 2 temples and the rice terrace. And on our request, he also stopped by the coffee plantation area for us to try the Luwak coffee, durian and cakes (3 different stops). He walked with us in the rice terrace and even encouraged us to walk deeper into the fields for better view and photos despite the fact that we were lagging behind our schedule. He just asked: \" Do you gals have any appointment tonight? Otherwise, just kept going and don't matter the time, I will be alright!\" He also took great pictures with us. On our way back, we wanted to finish our trip with a nice dinner in Seminyak and he brought us to the dining place! We ended up finishing our tour at around 8pm (2 hours later than our original plan) for which we were really grateful as we did all the amazing things on our trip. I really appreciated Ketut's hospitality and enthusiasm!The price is definitely reasonable and it includes all the entrance fees. And for lunch, we really enjoyed the place with a great view of the rice terrace! It was a really fun day!Thank you Ketut! I wish I would have another time to visit Bali again!I have recommended Ketut to my friend who was also visiting Bali. However, he has been fully booked in advance. so please book early!"

We travelled to Bali with another couple recently, and knowing how easy it is for time to slip away in this idyllic paradise, we decided to book a couple of day trips via the internet before our departure. Of course I turned to TripAdvisor - and the outstanding recommendation that grabbed my attention immediately was the one for Bali Traditional Tours - the best choice we could have made!! This is a small family tour business operated by cousins Ketut and Nyoman, both of whom are truly delightful - enthusiastic, warm and engaging, witty, educated and professional. Honestly, what a find! These boys are the real deal - working hard to do their families proud and genuinely committed to showcasing the region and ensuring visitors have an intimate cultural experience.Ketut was our guide on both of the day tours we arranged. He was completely flexible about itineraries, but we were perfectly happy to follow his suggestions which he adapted as needed. Our visit to a local primary school was a particular highlight \u2013 there was nothing rehearsed about it \u2013 no showy presentation for the benefit of tourists, simply a spontaneous visit to a school en route. Ketut had not been to this particular school before and seemed to have some explaining to do to the Principal before we were shown to a classroom to take part in an English lesson \u2013 a very entertaining and heart-warming experience.Similarly, we were grateful for the hospitality and warm welcome we received from his extended family when we visited his family compound at the end of the day. I\u2019ve been to Bali many times, but this was a special and memorable experience (and the best coffee I had in Bali!). Developing a comfortable rapport with Ketut was effortless - his English is excellent and his sense of humour is wicked! Our day tours with him felt genuinely personal and I\u2019m grateful to him for enriching our understanding of Balinese culture and for sharing with us the intricacies of family life. Highly recommended!"

The tour could not have been with anyone else kinder and he was quite pleasant to be around, incredibly knowledgeable and had a wonderful personality! Nyoman made it clear when we started this was OUR tour; so even though we signed up for the Bedugul tour, we could add on whatever else we wanted. Which we did! After visiting a local market, temples and rice terraces, we asked if he could take us to a place for coffee tasting. Sure enough he came through with a wonderful selection, Yoga Coffee, where we tried the famous kopi luwak...! Nyoman made this trip feel like we were hanging out with a great friend all day. He took us to his favorite place for Babi Guling, which was a non-touristy place on a side street sitting indian style on the ground... Best meal we had in Bali! When it rained, he came prepared with umbrellas and had extra sarongs in case we were cold from the rain or needed to dry off. Best of all, at the end of the tour we visited his home and met his lovely family. Nyoman made this trip unforgettable and we cannot thank him enough!

Ketut was very accommodating in our constant needs to stop to take photographs. Indeed, this led to our tours taking much longer each day than was planned (and at no extra charge).Unlike so many tour guides who want to take you to shops where they get commission, Ketut never once suggested such stops.Included in the very fair price of the day tours are all entrance fees to the temples and associated parking fees.We will certainly use this small but very reliable company again on our next visit."

We gained a true understanding of not only the Balinese people and their customs but also the history of this beautiful country. Watching the sunset on the Indian ocean was the perfect ending of a very long day, and Ketut our tour guide allowed us to enjoy every minute. Do not hesitate to book with this company. It is worth every dollar paid."

I chose the Kitamani and Ubud tours...both full days for $100 AUD each. Well worth it. I booked online and the response was extremely prompt and personalised. Travelling solo, I was made to feel very comfortable. Nyoman (who has the most infectious smile), was my guide, and the service, knowledge and pride he showed were outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble and the tours covered so much of the history and culture of Bali, which is what I was interested in. If you want to see the Real Bali, please consider booking with these 2 cousins,as I am sure you will not regret it. Thanks Nyoman (and the photos of the Elephant ride were great!)"

Not only did we get to see some of the scenic sites of central Bali, but we just felt like we learned so much about the history of Bali, the Indonesian culture, etc. Like anything in life, it's about the people. And Nyoman (and his family) reinforced this belief for me. His innate ability to be so welcoming and warm was what made this experience so great in our eyes. Nyoman allowing us to enter his home and meet his family made me feel very humbled and thankful in ways that I can't fully describe. For anyone visiting Bali, I highly recommend putting aside one day and learning about Nyoman's wonderful country and culture from a true individual who loves his country and culture."

I must say it was one of the best, most personalised tours we have ever done.Ketut took us to a local Balinese market, Hindu temple, coffee tasting, a visit to Ulun Danu temple (on lake Bratan) a stroll in a rice paddy, lunch at a little Balinese restaurant/warung and lots of little stops along the way.The service Ketut provided to us was friendly, fun, informative. On our tour Ketut told us history of what we were seeing, shared a few laughs and allowed us to relax in the car when we were tired. He was also kind enough to take photos for us and bring some lovely local sweet crispy treats for our coffee tasting.At the end of our 10 hour tour, Ketut dropped us at our hotel, as we were due to fly out that night to head home. We rushed out of the car, thanked Ketut for showing us an amazing day around Bali. We only had a few minutes to quickly change and head to the airport. As we made our way to the airport transfer car, with our luggage, I realised I had left my wallet on the back seat of Ketut's car. I couldn't believe it. As we were running late we had to make our way to the airport regardless and try and contact Bali Traditional tours to see if we could get it back.To my amazement, Ketut found it and contacted us and was so kind to come all the way back to the airport and give it to me. I was blown away buy Ketut's attitude. He was kind, gracious and smiling the whole time.Over all I would highly, highly recommend anyone to do this tour with Bali traditional tours. A wonderful experience. The next time we are back in Bali we will be taking another tour with Ketut.Thank you again Ketut. Brilliant job.Sampai jumpa."

We were surprised when the guide, Nyoman appeared at the doorstep of our villa instead of waiting for us by the main road as it was quite a walk through the village.Nyoman speaks good English which makes communication much easier and effortless. Throughout the tour, he shared a lot about the Balinese culture and made sure he answered all our questions. He was very professional and engaging in all aspects.The last stop of the tour includes a visit to his house which he shared with 27 other people!!! It was certainly interesting to have a feel of a typical Balinese household. It was definitely a day well spent with Nyoman and we thanked him for the experience."

This was my first time to Bali and I was initially hoping to book a group bus tour, until discovering that this is not really an option in Ubud. I reluctantly booked with Bali Traditional Tours due to the high reviews on TripAdvisor. I arranged everything through email, and received prompt and detailed responses within usually about 12 hours.Our tour guide for the day was Ketut, and he was so professional, friendly and knowledgeable that any nerves I had of the day were quickly gone. Ketut was so easy to talk to, even for a shy person such as myself. His english was very good, and he taught us about EVERY single aspect of the Balinese lifestyle, history and culture. He answered all of our questions and was impossible to stump, and so interesting to listen to. I think this tour company is a little more expensive than others, but it is worth it in every sense. There are also no hidden fees, and we were not charged any overtime fees, even when I requested we stop for dinner. We used one other tour company, that I booked before we left for our vacation. It was advertised as cheaper, but didn't include entrance fees, plus we were charged overtime, so the other tour company ended up being more expensive, and was a far lesser tour. I had wished I booked with Bali traditional tours both days.Ketut made the day very relaxing and simple for us, by paying for all the admission fees and being very clear to us as to where to meet him and what to do. He took us to a lot of places, such as the Balinese household, that I would never think to visit, but now looking back would be disappointed if I had not gone.Bali Traditional Tours is also a family run business, which I really liked too. I would recommend this company again and again!"

All of the attractions were wonderful and the support, commentary and information given by our guide excellent. At the school we had the opportunity to help students with their English lessons, this was an absolute highlight of the day. The temples we visited were wonderful, the views and walks through the rice terraces breathtaking. The day allowed us to learn so much about Balinese culture and religion and was a definite highlight of our holiday. We were dropped off home at around 6pm, making the day exceptional value for money. I highly recommend this family company."

I'd only add one personal anecdote: our toddler got car sick, and Ketut showed nothing but the most genuine concern and compassion after we stank up his meticulously clean SUV. It was consistent with his sincerity throughout the tour. Of course, he was also very knowledgeable and answered all of our random questions our the sights, Bali, Indonesia history, etc. He also tailored the tour to our request, even adding an additional stop at the Harmony Religious site where Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim places of worship stand next to one another on one compound. This is also an independently-run tour by three hard-working, young entrepreneurs, so the very reasonable tour costs go directly to them. Couldn't recommend this more highly!"

That was what we asked ourselves at the beginning of the tour - and now we know: Yes, it is! In one day Ketut gave us Bali in a nutshell, driving us to beautiful rice terraces and temples. What made the tour special was his willingness to explain all the aspects of Balinese life we never would have found out about ourselves. At his own family's home compound he explained about family traditions and offering customs, showing us their own temples as well as the chicken in the backyard. All the way round Ubud he never got tired answering our questions about the Balinese way of life. And at the fruit and spice plantation he made us taste \"Cat-Pooh-ccino\", as they called the beans that have passed the digestive system of a mongoose before being roasted. We had such an interesting and funny day with Ketut that we only can recommend his friendly and perfectly organized service. Thank you, Ketut!"

Immediately upon meeting him, we knew that we were in for two very special days. Nyoman's smile is infectious, his knowledge of Bali's history and culture is very impressive and his love of his country and sharing are to be admired. Most itineraries are fixed in terms of content and timelines but not so with B.T.T. Our days started at 9 a.m. and ended after 7:30 p.m. and during this time our heads were filled with all kinds of wonderful information not restricted to the sites that we visited . Our questions were encouraged. What a fantastic way to have become grounded on our first visit to Bali Please note that the fee he asked for the day is the same regardless of the number of people. What a bargain!. At the end of our first day of touring, Nyoman took us back to his family compound where we met his mother and father, his wife and children as well as some extended family members. We chatted while drinking the coffee and tea we were served and snacked on rice biscuits. My husband is a photographer and Nyoman always sensed when it was time to slow down or stop for a photo. We did not experience this with another driver who took us to the east coast of Bali - NO comparison whatsoever!!!! After our two days with Nyoman we were sad to say good-bye to this lovely, intelligent man with the beautiful smile, big heart. We will miss his wonderful sense of humour but we will cherish the time spent with him, the memories created and the photos taken during our unforgettable trip to Bali."

However, it was a special one which falls every three years on the Full Moon and so there were three traditional orchestras, brightly dressed pilgrims each with a different costume of their village and many different animals for sacrifice. What an experience- even Nyomen was excited as he had not seen many parts of this ceremony himself!He is only 25yrs , but has shown great entrepreneurial spirit starting this company with his cousin and does a fantastic job. He deserves all the custom he can get and is very appreciative of Tripadvisor for his clients. I would highly reccommend Bali Traditional tours."

We hired Bali Traditional Tours to take care of our airport transportation as well as show us around the island for a couple of days. Nyoman Grago was absolutely wonderful. He customized the tours to what we wanted.He gave us insight into traditional Bali. He took us to several eating places where the food was excellent and recommended several others near our hotel. Our hotel was also excellent, a recommendation from Nyoman.He took us to famous temples, a volcano, rice fields and terraces, coffee growing, a monkey forest, etc. He explained everything and answered all of our questions. He also pointed out numerous sights along the way. It's obvious he loves what he does, and we loved having him as our guide.We would highly recommend him to anyone visiting Bali.D & G KraemerOntario, Canada"

Nyoman was our very informative, amusing and fun guide. Nyoman's understanding of English was excellent. We were collected from our Sanaur hotel in a clean, air conditioned car, we were given bottled water and set off for Ubud. We visited monkey park where a monkey jumped on my head then down onto my shoulder - banana breath! We then went on to a temple, the volcano where we had lunch with an amazing view, the rice paddy terraces and finally we went to a traditional Balinese home where a family of 28 live together! I would not hesitate to recommend this tour company for any group and would book again if you are fortunate enough to visit Bali again."

It has, but I still had the most fabulous trip and enjoyed it immensely. I\u2019ve never been so sure about \u201cguides\u201d because I like to find things on my own, but if you want to see and experience a great deal of Bali in a short time \u2013 there is no better way.I decided to spend my first day in the Ubud area getting re-acquainted with the area and booked a custom tour with Nyoman. I first asked him to pick me up from the Bukit where I had been surfing for 11 days. He was busy that day so he sent a friend who was incredibly sweet and who took me to all of my requested stops on the way to Ubud \u2013 the elephant temple, some grocery shopping, the RipCurl surf shop to buy gifts, etc \u2026 he was knowledgeable about so many things. Then Nyoman and his brother were my guide and driver for my first day staying in Ubud. We had planned to spend a half day visiting a few areas around Ubud, but ultimately decided to venture a bit further and spent the entire day doing absolutely everything I had hoped to do\u2026 saw a traditional Barong dance in Batabulan village, visited the Tirta Empul Temple (holy water temple), the Satria family coffee/spice plantation in Sri Batu village, went north to Kintamani for lunch and a view of Mt. Batur (which I hiked during my last visit to Bali), visited the silver workshops and shops in Celuk and wood carving workshops in Kemenuh\u2026 I was shocked at how much ground we covered in 1 day and much I enjoyed our conversations about Bali, customs, religions, growth and change\u2026. We ended the day with a visit to Nyoman\u2019s family compound where I met his adorable 2 year-old twins, his wife, and many members of his family. It was such a fabulous day and I\u2019d highly recommend his services to anyone! He had his uncle take me to the airport on my last day and he was incredibly enjoyable as well."

That being said I suggest to book them early as to avoid being sold out. We are sure that Nyoman is an excellent guide, but this is for Ketut.First off, even if you do not know which tour you want to book but you know you want to book this specific company book them regardless. We were able to change our itinerary as we were on the road. Now on to Ketut. If you are lucky enough to book with Ketut please let him bring you to a school. Ketut is originally an english school teacher and his love for the kids and teaching shows when he's front of the classroom. We were able to help in his short lecture by interacting with the children by asking them questions.Throughout the day Ketut kept us entertained with the facts about his country and also learning about how he got to where he is today. He is a fascinating and smart person. The only down side is the Bali traffic. Roads are narrow and it may take some time to get to some of the sites. This in no way is their fault just be prepared to sit in the car and enjoy the scenery."

Nyoman speaks perfect English and is more knowledgable about his culture then the vast majority of my countrymen are about ours. He was willing and eager to discuss, in depth, any questions we had and answered them all to our complete satisfaction. His driving skills are superb and he built our tour so that we were constantly seeing new things save for the drive to and from Legian where we were staying.The highlight for us was meeting his wonderful family.....his mother, wife and children as well as his cousins. We toured his family compound and were thoroughly impressed with their lifestyle, generosity and friendliness.This was our first time to Bali and we fell in love with it mostly due to Nyoman and his exceptional tour. Prior to booking him I had read the reviews here and was impressed with how highly he was recommended. Now I know that no matter how highly I recommend him it will not be enough."

So you will get either gentlemen as your guide. Nyoman was our guide. He arrived at our resort 15 minutes before the scheduled pickup to wait for us (while we were having breakfast in the restaurant). We visited all the attractions as planned in the itinerary. All in good time, no rush at all. Perhaps this was also due to us not hanging around too long at each place, with the exception of Uluwatu where we waited for the sunset.Nyoman was very polite, patient and shared a lot about the Bali culture with us throughout the entire day. He was also interested in the way of life in Singapore, where we came from. The trip was pretty much a two-way conversation for the whole day. He was engaging in his explanations, and he also engaged us by asking questions to learn more about culture from Singapore.We requested local cuisine for lunch and he brought us to a small Balinese eatery along the streets known for its beef rendang. It was a place where the locals themselves patronize and not touristy at all, which was what we wanted. Needless to say, it was cheap - about 35,000 IDR for a meal (approx. US$3)!When he knew we wanted to drop by the supermarket at the end of the tour, he offered to wait for us while we did our grocery shopping before bringing us back to our resort, saying that the streets are dark and pavements are narrow so it is dangerous for us to find our way back. It's all goodwill at no extra charge.If we return to Bali, we will definitely contact him again for other tours. I travelled with my wife, and I have to add that we do not look for a luxurious way of travelling. Our expectations will differ from everyone else's, but if you are looking to experience the Balinese culture + countryside + way of life minus the touristy elements, this is the way to go.Nyoman, if you see this, thank you for your time that day. Will never forget the ferocious gnarling monkeys at Uluwatu. =)- Sim & Charlene"

Even though we stayed in Seminyak, Nyoman, dressed in charming traditional Baliness costume, was able to meet us at the hotel lobby at 10am. His Toyota SUV was really clean and more than comfortable for our family of 3. Nyoman managed to plan a fun-filled day around our interests (Baliness furniture hunting, water temple visit, meals at the famed BBQ pork Ibu Oka and not-to-be-missed Dirty Duck aka Bebek Bengil). Nyoman was very fluent in English. We had no trouble communicating at all. Having a pair of twins at toddler age himself, he was wonderful with our toddler. He brought our toddler to feed the sacred fishes in the water temple, to view the different types of trees in the coffee plantation, to dress him in the traditional wrap dress. Our toddler simply adored Nyoman! With the distance between Seminyak and Ubud and the busy traffic, we ended up returning to our hotel quite a lot later (almost 7pm) and no complaints/extra charge from Nyoman at all! I couldn't recommend Nyoman enough! I would be sure to call Nyoman again in my next visit to Bali."

We worked with Nyoman of Bali Traditional Tours who structured a 4 - 5 days of fun filled tours for us. The highlights for me personally include Tanah Lot, Kecak dance, school visits, white water rafting. I also find the salt farm and the coffee and fruit plantation visits very interesting. Nyoman was very knowledgeable and took great care of us: Took us to currency exchange, planning places for us to eat, provide us with wraps for the temple, etc. He also has a great sense of humour. Thank you Nyoman. We had a memorable time."

We did a couple of tours and I can say that our day with Ketut was, by far, the best out of all of them and probably the best experience we had in Bali. You will not regret taking a tour with this company. Ketut was friendly, polite and knowledgable (and a very good photographer too!!). His car was very comfortable. He was able to give us a lot of information about the attractions that other guides were not. His English is excellent. He was very accommodating and flexible too. There really isnt that much I can say that other reviews haven't covered already! I can only confirm that all the good stuff you read is true!This is the best way to see the real Bali. But make sure you book in advance! I tried to book another tour with Ketut but he was booked out for the rest of our stay!"

            "review": "5 Reasons You Will Love Bali Traditiona Tours. Bali Traditional Tours5 Reasons you will love Bali Traditional Tours:1) Informative: We\u2019ve taken other private tours in different parts of the world and we often left with a sense of the culture and some generic information about the country. However, this tour was totally different. Nyoman, our guide, began to tailor the tour to our interests right away and was by far the most knowledgeable tour guide we have ever had. He asked us some questions to get to know us the first day and realized that we were very into the flora and fauna of Bali. From there during the following tour days we did with him (yes, we liked him so much we spent 5 days with him, adding 2 more days onto our original 3!), he went out of his way to point out every natural element he could find and was nearly an expert on it; from different plants found alongside the road and rice fields, to information about the monkeys and other wildlife of the island. He often noted what also not to touch or to look out for- like poisonous plants, etc\u2026 I had a lot of questions about the culture and history of the island and Nyoman fulfilled my inquisitive mind with bounds of information. It was awesome! 2) Impeccable and punctual. Nyoman was always arrived on or before we expected him and dressed very nicely in the traditional Balinese clothing--- and you\u2019ll know him right away because he has the biggest, brightest smile. 3) Personable: Nyoman has a fantastic personality. He smiles all the time, tells great jokes, and is warm and welcoming. Being a tour guide never appears like a \u201cjob\u201d to him. He seems to love what he does and loves working with people.\u2014it really shows!4) A great reference: Every time and I really do mean EVERY SINGLE TIME Nyoman referred us to something, it was awesome. He referred us to some restaurants both during the tour and for other days when we weren\u2019t with him and wouldn\u2019t you know, it was the best food we ate--- possibly ever! When we explored by ourselves some restaurants based on internet reviews, they may have been good, but they weren\u2019t as good as Nyoman\u2019s referrals. If he says that he thinks you might like something, you better try it, because it will be phenomenal! Note: These are not places that he refers for kickbacks either, because often we went to these places without Nyoman, so this is a genuine referral. He also referred us to activities and sights and was just as spot on with meeting our interests and needs. He knows what\u2019s good and what you will like and he does a great job of referring you to it. 5) Not just a tour guide, a friend: At the end of our 5 tour days with Nyoman we really felt a connection to the island and to him. He made us feel a part of Bali in no way we had ever experienced on a tour before. He brought us to meet his family, which are the most wonderful people you will ever meet, and he also went with us into the water temple and navigated us through a traditional Hindu/Balinese prayer and even took me to see a traditional Balinese medicine man--- something most tourist don\u2019t do. We were the only tourists often in some areas and we felt totally comfortable in our place because we had a wonderful guide constantly leading us through the unfamiliar territory and making us feel welcomed. I hope to travel back to Bali one day soon. And if I do, Nyoman will be the first person I call."

Although he is so highly rated in trip advisor, our experience was even better than we expected. Nyoman is very knowledgeable about the history and culture of Bali. Furthermore he provided excellent restaurant recommendations that delivered the experiences that we requested. Nyoman is reliable, flexible, friendly, personable and genuinely cares about providing great services. I had contacted Nyoman to book my trip in Feb and I liked their service instantly as they responded very quickly. From that point on, everything was handled perfectly and there were no hassles. Also the tour price was very resonable.I have travelled to many countries and taken many tours. I would give Nyoman and Bali Traditional Tours my highest recommendations."

            "review": "A wonderful cultural tour of the heart of Bali - Ubud and beyond. Our tour with Ketut took place on our first full day in Bali, and it provided the perfect introduction to Balinese culture. From the moment we met him, Ketut was gracious, knowledgeable, amusing, and flexible. We had requested a couple of changes to the Kintamani tour, and he helped us create a perfect day that accommodated specific interests of everyone in our family of four (parents and daughters aged 21 and 23.) and minimized long stretches of time in the car. We learned so much about Balinese history, culture, religious traditions and family life, and each place we visited was special in its own way including the coffee and spice plantation, the Tirta Empul Holy Water temple, and the rice terraces of Tegallanang. When we headed up to Mount Batur, it had started to rain and we were concerned that our only views would be of clouds. But, by the time we had finished lunch at the top of the mountain, the clouds cleared to reveal magical views of the mountain, evidence of past volcanic eruptions, and the lake in the distance. Bali's roads can be crowded and chaotic, with motorbikes everywhere and a very loose definition of what consistututes a \"lane\". Ketut's driving was so assured and smooth that none of us were carsick or nervous, and he graciously answered all my many questions as we drove from one destination to another, and spent considerable time at each of the sights explaining everything we were seeing. I agree with the other comments on Trip Advisor that Ketut's obvious pride in his country and its very special culture make him an ideal guide. We never felt rushed, and yet we saw so much in a single day. We were so pleased with Ketut's services that we hired him for a second partial day, and he drove us from Ubud down to our villa in Sanur, and stopped along the way so that we could see batik being made at Batubalan. Ketut will handle the entrance fees to the various sites and they are built into the daily charges. Before you go, be sure to read up on how to bargain. You will visit a few places where there are things for sale, (e.g., Mas for wood carvings) but don't feel pressured to buy, and don't expect Ketut to help you negotiate, as he wisely stays out of the bargaining process. All in all, it was a wonderful experience, a great value, and we would not hesitate to recommend Ketut and Bali Traditional Tours."

I have travelled to Bali a number of times and been on a significant number of tours over the past 20 years. Without doubt, this tour (Tanah Lot and Rice Terrace) was the best I have been on. Ketut was a lovely guide, taking great pride in his business and his country. He spent the entire day with us, explaining the culture and significance of each site. His recommendation for lunch was fantastic - a lovely local restaurant high in the hills surrounded by the rice terraces of Jatiluwih.

Our decision to explore Bali with Bali Traditional Tours was based on the excellent wrap given in the tripadviser by those who had previously toured with them and we fully endorse their comments. We initially booked 3 tours, but ended up doing our 4th tour with them, as well as got them to drops us at the airport on the 5th day.  Pre-tour communication and booking arrangements with Bali Traditional Tours was simple, straightforward with no hidden costs and their response time was very quick.  Ketut, our tour guide was a very pleasant, punctual, and a knowledgeable young man full of enthusiasm, had a good understanding on customer service. He well understood my expectations being an armature photographer who liked to experience the REAL Bali, Balinese culture, people and customs and he customized our tour to meet my needs. We were impressed with his knowledge on history, and traditions in Bali and also on Hindu epics i.e. \u2018Ramayanaya\u2019 , Mahabharata and explained them to us in in simple English. Apart from the usual tourist attractions, he took us to markets, shops, restaurants where locals go and introduced us local food, fruits, sweets and drinks. Wow it was a fantastic experience! Also Ketut helped us bargaining and acted as our interpreter with the locals but at no occasion tried to promote us buying into anything. He was a very careful driver and never took chances on the road. We also admired his patience specially when we were taking too long at certain picturesque places taking photographs, and he soon became my assistant in carrying my camera gear, and helping me change lenses, and guiding me to the best vintage points for photography. He was very concerned about our belongings and made sure we do not leave anything behind. We were invited to visit his residence compound which was a great experience to witness a typical Balinese life style. We also witnessed the behind the scene activities where preparations were done in the temple ceremonies, met lots of people, took lots of colorful photographs, even tasted some food being prepared for offerings which was an opportunity no ordinary tourist would enjoy. We missed out visiting a school due to the school examination time, but will experience that in our next visit to Bali.I would confidently recommend Bali Traditional Tours and Ketut to anyone who wants to see REAL Bali!"

He arrived early on the day of the tour to pick us up. We chose to do the South Bali and Ulu Watu tour and we thoroughly enjoyed it.Our first stop was to visit a traditional Balinese family compound to see how the Balinese live. This was so interesting to see, and it was touching to meet Nyoman's family - including his parents and twin sons. We truly felt welcomed into their home. After this we visited the Royal Temple of Taman Ayun. It was stunningly beautiful - the gardens, the lake, the temples. After this we visited a spice and coffee plantation where we sampled a variety of teas and coffees, and Nyoman explained the process of making Luwak coffee. From there we enjoyed a stunning drive through some of the most stunning scenery to see Tanah Lot. It was a real highlight to see this temple perched on the rock with the gorgeous Indian Ocean surrounding it. After a quick and delicious lunch stop, we headed to our last stop, the Ulu Watu Temple.After our day with Nyoman we really felt that we had seen and learned so much. Nyoman was accommodating to our every need and a wealth of knowledge. But what truly made this tour exceptional was Nyoman himself - he is friendly, funny, genuine - just a truly wonderful soul. You must do a tour with Bali Traditional Tours if you are fortunate enough to visit this country. I cannot wait to return to Bali and spend another day with our new friend seeing more of this beautiful island."

Nyoman's a great tour guide- he has good food recommendations, he is so familiar with driving around Bali and knows most of the popular places to go to, and he tells you so much about the interesting cultures of Bali. Even though the distance between the places that we wanted to visit were far, he would try his best to plan your day for you such that you can visit all the places. I have to say that I was truly impressed with his service as he remembered that I had nose allergies when he heard me sniffing in the car. My previous tour with him was almost a year ago!! Thank you Nyoman!! :)During our long journeys, Nyoman was also a great person to chat with and my bf and I could talk about anything and everything with him.

We all have visited Bali many times, but this was the best day out we have ever had. The tour was interesting and fun and all day we were entertained and looked after by Nyomen. Everything is explained really well and he is a very careful driver. I can recommend this tour to anyone visiting bali, it is just great."

            "review": "Best tour we've ever taken!. Bali Traditional Tours offers amazing experiences that take you to the heart and soul of Bali. We took two tours with the delightful Nyoman -- Ubud and Environs and South Bali. The first tour included visits to a batik workshop, a silversmith, and two incredible wood carvers, as well as an impromptu stop to see a children's gamelan practice. We also saw the famed rice terraces of Tegallalang and the beautiful temple at Tampaksiring, where a festival was being honoured. More gamelan, too! The day concluded with a stop at his family compound, where he explained the cultural and religious significance of the architecture and layout. On the South Bali tour, we visited the rice terraces of Jatiluwih and the famous temple at Tanah Lot. But the absolute highlight was our stop at a local school, where Nyoman introduced us to a class of lovely, enthusiastic children who were full of questions about our culture. Do not miss this charming segment of the tour; it really made our day! Our guide, Nyoman, is a wonderful ambasssador for his culture, customs and country and we greatly enjoyed sharing our time with him."

Although we had chosen a specific tour he was willing to take us to any location we desired. We toured the artisan villages where specific areas determine what you will see. There was textiles, silver, wood carving and temple designs. It was definitely a highlight to see the talents of the people. We stopped in Ubud for lunch at the Melting Wok and had delicious curry with coconut milk. We visited amazing temples and our driver gave us a history on the hindu beliefs and cultures. Driving through the rice paddies and villages was a beautiful contrast to the beach view we also had. I definitely suggest adding a tour to your visit especially if you're only there for a short time like we were. Overall, I loved Bali and will definitely go back for an extended stay...and probably set up a crate to send back beautiful hand-made furniture!"

Nothing is too much bother, everything is explained so well. Really flexible with your day and always asking if you wish to stop, have something to eat, is the air con ok etc etc. Such a caring and devoted guide I have never come across in 12 countries. So progressional. Don't be talked into going with a cheaper or different company by your hotel or the locals, this is one tour company you don't want to miss out on. Will be using again when in Bali next. They also offer airport transfers or just to be your driver for anytime you wish. Couldn't be happier, they deserve their high rating:)"

When in Bali for the 1st time, one is torn between relaxing by the breathtaking scenery & jus soaking in the sun, sea and many spa facilities available. However, please start your visit with at least a day spent with Ketut. Being very familiar with trip advisor, as a tour guide myself (for 26yrs!) I have a great desire to know a country on a deeper level. Ketut is a wonderful ambassador of his country. Sincere (I needed to request to be taken shopping) & knowledgeable with a great sense of pride for his culture & religion. He makes every effort to help you understand the spirit of the Balinese, explaining every detail with passion & a touch of lighthearted humour. I couldn't have asked for a better guide to show me the real beauty of Bali. Thank you Ketut, we will be back for sure. Carol and Sher Min"

Nyoman picked us up in our hotel in Seminyak and we had a wonderful day with him! Not only did we learn a lot about the culture of the Balinese, the Hindu gods, the way of living etc. but we also visited many iconic and many traditional sites! It was a real pleasure to visit touristic highlights like the Ubud Monkey Forest and the Holy Spring Temple with Nyoman, who could tell us everything about the locations, meanings and history - this really makes the difference! But what is really the highlight of the tour is the not-so-touristic elements: the visit of the traditional village, a Balinese restaurant and a fruit and coffee plantation where we were the only guests. Apart from this Nyoman is a really nice guy, who drives very safely (which is unique in Bali!), is always willing to stop during the trip to explain things and who really enjoys telling you about himself and the Balinese culture. Very highly recommended, if we return to Bali we'd definitely book a tour with Bali Traditional Tours again!"

I booked the tour a couple of months in advance since we were leaving on a 44 day trip, most of it on a Regent Seven Seas cruise, ending with 3 days in Bali. It may have been my favorite day of the entire trip! We spent the day with Nyoman who took us to a locall market (where we got to try some unusual fruits), the volcano, a traditional restaurant, a spice/coffee plantation, a temple, AND his family compound. We learned so much about the traditional Bali life! Nyoman is well informed, enthusiastic, and open. He speaks excellent English and is a great driver;-) He listens to clients and responds to their interests - and he's interested in hearing about your culture as well. You won't go wrong in spending a day or two with Bali Traditional Tours. It's a great little company that deserves to succeed!"

He wanted to show them that they should work hard and learn to speak English to communicate with the rest of the world. I cannot recommend Bali Traditional Tours enough.

I have taken tours with Thai Tour Guide in Bangkok and Blue Elephant Thailand tours in Chiang Mai, both which are highly rated on tripadvisor . None of the impressed me enough to leave a review. Nyoman Grago is a cut above the rest - he is honest , sincere and focuses on doing his job well and is well deserving of all the accolades accorded to him by the previous reviewers. We had a day with him to see the East of Bali. He got on effortlessly with all the members of ours group ranging from 3years to 70years.He graciously invited us into his village home and the kids were thrilled at being able to see chickens,pigs and rabbits in the compound in stark contrast to our small high rise living abode back home.His beautiful wife and family welcomed us whilst he explained the structure of the compound to us. We noticed that the best room in the house was reserved for guests-my husband later commented that they were very \"hao ke\" .which translates to them being very hospitable as the best is kept for the guests.The ladies in his extended family were great at making balinese leaf offerings-they make about 50 per day to use around the house.We proceeded to see the Bat Cave Temple In East Bali and enjoyed seeing the traditional way where sea salt is harvested from the ocean.Unfortunately, this appears to be a dying trade as it is not very viable and there are only 2 families left in the East Coast still invested in the trade.We subsequently visited a Orang Bali Asli traditional village whereby it is the traditional for the village folks to marry within the village. He told me that a distant aunt from his own village broke that traditional by marrying in, and so his uncle in law had to pay a \"fine\" to the village.Bali traditional tours would not be the same without NYOMAN GRAGO. It is his personality that infuses a WOW factor into the tour.We wish both him and his family the best in health and business and hopes that he stays as charming as we remember him.RegardsAudrey and family"

We were never hurried, and he gave freely of his time if there were additional things of interest to explore. Everything was explained well, and we came away feeling that we now know so much about the history, culture, traditions and life of the Balinese people. Yes, we could possibly have got some other local to take us around for the day a bit cheaper, but we felt we had had excellent value-for-money, and we had been given experiences we most likely would have missed out on with any other tour operator. We were especially interested in visiting a local primary school, where we had an almost overwhelming welcome from the enthusiastic children.

I found him from Tripadvisor and as I see that his 'Bali Traditional Tours' website is more well presented than the others, I felt inclined to use his service . I traveled with my energetic 14 years old son and we booked river rafting on August 4, Bali Safari and Marine Park on August 5 and two custom tours on August 6 and 7. I emailed Nyoman one week ahead and got a prompt answer which confirmed all the tours with details the next night. On our way to river rafting, Nyoman briefed us on Bali's culture and religion and pointed out interesting places to us. He brought us to Mega Rafting and there we met a very nice coach, Wayan. It was an exciting but not dangerous experience and there were hot shower and a big plate of food awaiting for us at the end.  We love the Bali Safari as we had the chance of hugging an orangutan, touching a baby lion and riding an elephant (Nyoman helped us to book the elephant riding). The Bali Agung Theater Show in the Safari was highly recommended by Nyoman and we found that it was a really entertaining show with professional dancers and musicians and many lovely animals. This show is a lot better than the Devdan show in Bali Nusa Dua Theatre which we found overpriced (at US$65 to US$120 per adult) and mediocre. Please remember that the show is only included in packages (starting from jungle hopper package which is only US$49 per adult). The custom tours are (1)Ubud Artisan Villages -- Sacred Monkey Forest -- Uluwatu Temple and (2)Pura Ulun Duna Temple -- rice terraces of Tegallalang -- Tanah Lot Temple.  Nyoman paid all the entrance fees and he even bought us banana to feed the monkeys. As my son and I were not interested in the coarse batik sold in the tourist market but found his sarong better looking, he brought us to this very little local shop where I got a real bargain for some beautiful woven sarongs. He also helped us to book the Bebel Bengil Dirty Duck Restaurant in which you can sit on a raised platform overlooking the rice paddle the Balinese way. Remember to ask Nyoman to reserve the smoked duck (one day advance booking) if you want to try something in addition to the crispy duck. In the Pura Ulun Duna Temple, he was so excited about the good weather as he had never encountered such a sunny day there. We finally came to the conclusion that we benefited from a good date in the Balinese calendar. In the rice terraces, he explained to my city kid the unique irrigation system used and showed him the plow carried by the ox. He found lemongrass on the road and crashed the grass to let my son to smell the aroma. Nyoman made us understand how Balinese love their religion, culture and living.  Thanks Nyoman!"

My wife has a thing for food stalls(spicy corn griilled and mangosteen) Grago was kind enough to drive around looking for these things and when he saw them along the way he stopped, helped us get a good local price, and made it possible for us enjoy our local delicacy which was off the tourist trail. The stop to try coffee luwat was also a pleaser, I however regret not getting an entire bag of coffee ginseng from the place we visited. I ended up getting the one at the airport which as lame. All in all I highly recommend this tour, a down to earth guide, very friendly and personable, easy to talk life with as well as Bali culture, but it's the little things that count. These are things that make this tour different. I wish there was a Grago guide in every country I visited."

He is very fluent in English and is happy to share his wealth of knowledge about Bali and also the customs/traditions and religion/ceremonies. He never becomes frustrated, he drives safely and he has a good sense of humour which is important. Also, as I was travelling with another female, it is worth noting that Ketut is in no way inappropriate or sleazy and doesnt make anyone uncomfortable (as can sometimes be the case with some drivers in Bali.Highly recommend this company - it may seem a little costly at first but it is worth it for the service (also includes water, entry fees and travel in a nice clean cool van)."

We were visiting Bali for first time, we contacted Nyoman by email and everything went better than expected, he was really caring and dedicated. The webpage has all info you may need. Additionally, we tailor made our 2 days tours combinen different tours and we have a great time. We were 2 families traveling together (6 kids and 4 adults). Bali Traditional tours organised for us 2 cars traveling together in Bali's different locations, well sinchronysed. Reviews are very accurate, You won't be disappointed! We did the temples (with kecak dance), the rice fields (with visit to caffee and fruit plantations) and volcano. The visit to the tradicional balinese house was the cherry on top. All worth it! Price is more than convenient."

My husband and I took a modified version of the Kintamani and could not have been more delighted with the service we received from Ketut and the sights along the way. He even had spare sarongs for both men and women which you can borrow before you enter the temples. We made an early morning stop at the Besakih (mother temple). You need to take a local guide in there. Worth seeing if you can get past the constant parting with your money while you're in there. Ketut was almost ashamed of this when we told him just because it reflected badly on Bali. We were not sorry we saw it though. It is a small family business that is run professionally and deserves every good word it gets. Enjoy the beautiful Bali..."

If you're visiting Bali and are interested in more than just a beach holiday, book a session with Bali Traditional Tours. You won't be disappointed!We had an amazing experience travelling with our guide Nyoman to various spots around Bali. He's such a wonderful host, warm person and able to provide you with loads of interesting facts of the sites you'll be visiting.Let me set the scene for you. We were able to build our own itinerary (or you can choose one of the packages), we were picked up from our hotel and it was just the two of us with our guide Nyoman. How's that for the personal-touch?!Our itinerary:- We started the day going to the traditional market where we bought some nice snacks with the bargaining help provided by Nyoman- Next we visited the Gunung Kawi Temple. Nyoman told us so many interesting details about the many religious traditions and the history behind the site. It gave us a much better understanding and appreciation of the uniqueness of this site- We proceeded on to Kintamani volcano, where Nyoman drove us to a perfect spot to take pictures and hardly any tourists go- The coffee and fruit plantation offered a nice little break in the itinerary and a great chance to taste some amazing coffee flavours- Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple is one of the most important Balinese Hindu sites and an opportunity to see and experience some unique religious rituals. Having a guide there, makes the experience so much more fruitful- Next Nyoman took us to his rice field (yes, he's also a rice farmer!) and to his family compound. This was probably the highlight of the day, where we were graciously offered a glimpse of traditional Balinese life and got the opportunity to meet his beautiful wife and twin children.There is no doubt in my mind that the guided tour is worth ever penny. You get so much more out of visiting the various sites by having someone like Nyoman explaining to you the not-so-well-known facts and explaining the many traditions and rituals.Thank you Nyoman for your warm hospitality and showing us so much! You have a rare gift. Best wishes to you, your wife, Galih and Galuh."

It was just myself and my 9 year old traveling and she was very keen on going to Ubud to see the monkey sanctuary. Firstly we booked the tour from home and could not believe how quickly and efficiently everything was organized. Nyoman picked us up from our hotel in a nice, clean, airconditioned car. His English is very good, he is genuinely friendly, flexible and professional. He didn't mind me asking all sorts of questions and he was very knowledgeable. He made us feel very welcome and comfortable straight away. I wished we had more time so that we could have explored more of Bali under his guidance. Will definitely book again with Nyoman if I ever go back to Bali!Nyoman, you are lovely and we wish you and your family all the best from Helga and Laura."

This was our first trip to Bali, and Nyoman's tour (of East Bali) was among one of several tours we took while visiting. By far, this one was the best (when you accidentally book one with an inferior company, you will know the difference)! Nyoman spoke excellent English, and was extremely knowledgeable about the history and each destination. Driving around for several hours, we had a wonderful time getting to know each other, asking questions, and sharing laughs. Nyoman truly has a gift for speaking to people: he made us feel welcome, like old friends. We saw many sights and stopped to take pictures of the beautiful countryside. The nice thing about Nyoman--another contrast with other less enthusiastic guides--is that he is willing to improvise and slow down to sort of \"zoom in\" and behold a special village gathering, view, or sunset. Although we did not get a chance to visit the traditional school that was listed on the itinerary, his meticulous guidance through all of the other sites, he attentiveness, and his warm persona made up for it. If we could plan our vacation again, we would have cancelled our other tours and stuck with Bali traditional tours for a few days. My husband and I recommend this trip to ALL visitors--new and returning--as the tours are packed with so much information and all around a wonderful experience. Thank you, Nyoman, for making our vacation such a wonderful adventure!"

All of the previous reviews couldn't be more spot on in terms of the wonderful service provided by Nyoman and his cousin.We were lucky to have Nyoman, who speaks excellent English show us around Bali. He was courteous, polite, funny, and a very safe driver (especially in the crowded streets of Bali). We had a fantastic time on the Bengul Tour where we visited several temples, rice fields, and drove through the beautiful Bali countryside. Nyoman recommended this little restaurant overlooking the rice fields of Jatiluwih, and it was one of the best lunches we've had! It was a treat to have him join us for lunch, as he was so grateful to us for that, further proving how the Balinese are the nicest people we have encountered on our travels. Nyoman was very knowledgable about Balinese history and culture, and answered all of our questions. This tour was the highlight of our short stay in Bali! Honestly, we still talk about the tour even after returning, and Nyoman is such a good ambassador for Bali that we can't wait to return again so we could take his other tours. Do not hesistate to book with them, as the booking process was very easy and you pay after the tour - so no need to go through Paypal or having to give your credit card information online."

I received a reply back very quickly confirming that Ketut would pick us up from our 2nd hotel at 9am. Ketut was on time arriving in a very neat clean little SUV. The service was excellent, Ketut's english, knowledge and love of his country was so obvious. Not only did we see the regular tourist spots but we also had an insight into the Balinese way of life, the culture and religion it was a totally wonderful experience and one that I would recommend to anyone visiting Bali who wants to learn more about the Balinese culture. Please also refer to Ruben & Adriana's comments because I could not of put the experience any better than the way they describe, there are many points that I remember from this tour that I still refer to when speaking to people back in Australia about. my experience Thank you Ketut, we hope you like the photo and hope to be back again soon."

Ketut is extremily polite, intelligent, knows every aspect of balinese history , culture an society aspects with a special interest.This is the kind of person who makes you feell emotion for the love he has for his country. He is one of them. You will never feel you are been shown a place by a touristic point of view. Of course you will visit all touristic sites, but the difference from a regular tour is made by himself. The cultural background of this university student is an open book. I can't remember I have learned so much from any 3 days tours during my entire life. And I travel a lot.When my plane left Bali, I had the impression that all my beliefs and knowledge, even the most solid ones have been changed forever for what I could see, for what I could learn. And Ketut was responsible for that mind change I and my wife had forever.I don't know if I will have the opportinty of visiting Bali again, since I live thousands of kms away, but I would like to thank you ketut for the \" bali book\" he has read with us.Thank you and all the gods bless you.Rubens and Adriana"

Nyoman drives safely, is very polite, personable and consults with us as to what we want to do and see. He did not bring us to tourist traps which is quite refreshing. We had a grand time with him trying out babi guling on roadside warung a few minutes from the Tanah Lot temple and at dinner, we treated him to Bebek Bengil (Dirty Duck Diner) where we ordered the ever famous crispy duck, baby back ribs, and sambal fish in banana leaf. He was quite happy to finally try out the ever popular restaurant for the first time. He shared some more stories of Balinese culture including the medicine man and his incredible experience with one of them. We told him that the next time we visit, we'd like him to accompany us to the medicine man. For all his hard work and effortless guiding, he definitely deserves a fat tip."

This was our first trip to Bali, Nusa Dua with our 7 yr old twins and I am so glad we booked a tour with Nyoman at Bali Traditional Tours. Our pick was the full day \"Tanah Lot & Rice Terrace Tour\" and we opted for the late departure time at 10am as we wanted to catch and photograph the beautiful sunset at Tanah Lot. After a 90 mins drive our first stop was Taman Ayun Temple, followed by an amazing scenic drive through the rice fields of Jati Luwih. Nyoman picked a perfect little restaurant, called \"Wr DHEA where we had a wonderful lunch of Mie Goreng, Orange Chicken, Sate Ayam, Ayam Betatu, Bubur Injin and several drinks. The whole affair cost IDR 370000, about 40USD. Their rice pudding with coconut milk is a must! It was truly delicious. After lunch we headed down the hill passing the rice fields one more time towards the main attraction of the day, Sunset at Tanah Lot on the west coast. We decided to make a quick stop at a coffee and cocoa plantation along the way that we have passed by earlier that morning. Unfortunately we got there just a few minutes before 5pm and thus we missed the demonstration of how to roast coffee beans in the most traditional way. Even though the guides were not there anymore, Nyoman was still able to lead us around pointing out the most interesting things to see and arranged for a quick coffee and tea tasting. Our favorite flavors were the Lemon Tea, Ginger Tea and the Mocha. \"Luckily\" the gift shop was still open and we picked up a few pre-mixed packets of these delicious teas and coffees. (should you miss this stop, don't worry you'll be able to find these and other flavors at the airport shops in the transit area - and even a bit cheaper, too)From the coffee plantation to Tanah Lot, with very heavy traffic, it took us a full hour to get there, but we finally made it around 6.30pm just as the sun was setting over the horizon. If you'd like to walk on the beach and see the Temple up close, you might want to get there at least an hour earlier. It's also a bit of a walk from the parking lot.It was a great day with a great tour guide and lots of interesting, new information on the Balinese culture and amazing sites. We'd definitely recommend Nyoman and his cousin Ketut to our fellow travelers and we'll surely be back to Bali in a hope to discover more amazing parts of the Island with Bali Treaditional Tours.All the best to you, Nyoman and warm greetings from Singapore. See you soon!"

This being our second time back in lovely Ubud (the first being in late 2010), it was a no-brainer that we should engage Nyoman again to guide us through the various places in Bali. Our first trip had been too short to do much (though he had obligingly brought us to various places such as Uluwatu in a short half-day trip that lasted till late in the evening), so we decided to stay longer for this trip and then take up a full two-day tour of the various temples and local attractions in and around Bali.Nyoman was his usual cheerful self during our excursions to Gunung Kawi temple, Kintamani with its beautiful view of Mt Agung, Taman Ayun temple, a coffee and tea plantation and other places like Puru Ulun Danu temple. He even obligingly brought us to the Monkey Forest in Ubud to round off the second day even though it was late, and he had family waiting for him at home.I'll fondly remember the fields of Jatiluwih, the wonderful Ayam Betutu at Warung Rhea (he's spot-on when it comes to food recommendations!) and the quaint little village of Petulu where the white herons congregate only on certain trees (you have to see it to believe it!). I'll also remember our candid conversations about each other's hopes and plans for the future, including me trying to explain the history of my country as the three of us (him, my fiancee and I) laboriously climbed back up the steps at Gunung Kawi.The lad may be young but he's very steeped in culture, wisdom and passion in keeping the spirit of traditional Balinese dance and music alive. I've grown to love the Balinese way of life (not the surfing culture though), and have every intention of coming back again soon - this time with friends. Thank you very much, Nyoman. It's been a memorable trip for the both of us, and we will definitely be in touch with you during our next trip!- With very best regards from friends in Singapore"

I made all my transportation- pick-up at airport, two full days touring, drop off at airport - arrangements thru Bali Traditional tours over the Internet. I was a little worried as we were a party of 4 women and it was our first time in Bali. Bur everything went very smoothly! Wayan was waiting at the the airport and the two full days of touring with Nyoman were a delight! He tailored the tour to suit our needs and was ever patient and was willing to do anything for us! Plus, he has a great sense of humor and is a wonderful person! Thanks to them we had a great trip! Nyoman's English is very good and their prices were competitive."

My partner and I pre-booked the Bedugul tour with Ketut prior to arriving in Bali - based on the trip advisor reviews we had read - so glad we did - it was faultless!  Ketut arrived on time and the car was as described and very comfortable, Ketut has good english and the tour was a delight - we managed to have ample time at all stops and took in local cultural stops (including a wedding), everywhere we went, Ketut offered interesting commentary and explanation and handled everything including entry tickets, even stopping off for us to take lunch at a restaurant and a mini mart to take snacks back to our hotel - the service from Ketut was first class and exceeded the service we had received in other private hires we have used across the globe.We were so delighted with our day that we went on to book another trip whilst we were in Bali - taking in the monkey forest and Tanah Lot temple, Ketut was busy this day and supplied a driver - as equally a fantastic day!We cannot recommend Bali Traditional Tours highly enough - this is our first review on Trip Advisor and we felt the need to start reviewing after benefiting from others review of this company - If you are looking for a driver in Bali please use Ketut and Bali Traditional Tours!"

We arranged 3 full day tours with Bali Traditional Tours and had the privilege of being shown around the beautiful island with Nyoman as our knowledgeable, enthusiastic and friendly guide. As mentioned before Nyoman is a fantastic ambassador for his country and our time with him gave us a unique insight into the culture, religion and traditions of Balinese people. We take back home so many fond memories of our time in Bali, from eating noodle soup from the back of a bike in the pouring rain to feeding monkeys bananas by the side of the rice paddies and many many more! We feel extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to meet Nyonman and count him as a friend!Thank you, your English friends Lauren and Kirstin."

He has studied both English and religion and is proficient with both.Ketut arrived at our hotel as scheduled in a large, air conditioned van in good condition. We began the day by discussing what we wanted to see. When we mentioned that we weren't interested in some of the sites on the set itinerary, he readily offered alternative itineraries for our day. My wife mentioned a temple that she was very interested in seeing and, even though it was fairly far out of the way, Ketut did not hesitate to add it to our plan. We truly felt like it was OUR day.Everywhere we went, Ketut offered interesting commentary and explanation. He always handled all of the logistics, finding parking, paying for tickets, showing us where to walk. We felt very comfortable and secure. Just one anecdote that really shows how special this tour was. After the regularly scheduled itinerary plus the added temple for my wife, we expected to be brought back to our hotel. Ketut asked if there was anything else that we were interested in seeing while we were in Bali. When we mentioned that we were interested in going to Celuk, a town known for jewelry south of Ubud, he drove out of his way to the town. When we did not find any jewelry we liked at the first shop, he brought us to an jeweler across town. Considering our tour had already lasted more than eight hours, he really went above and beyond all of our expectations.If you are looking for a driver to give you a tour around Bali... just call Bali Traditional Tours. Trust me, you won't regret it."

Ketut Mawa, our guide was very professional and personable who really gave us a taste of the wonderful Balinese culture. His English was excellent. He was able to describe with just the right amount of detail the various aspects of the social, cultural and religuous life of his people. As it was a sunday we asked if he could drive us from Ubud to the Denpasar Catholic church for our service at 7am. this was just fine and he then took us to a typical roadside restaurant for a very yummy breaksfast. The Itinerary we went on was to the Kintamani mountain whereby we stopped at a small local market then visited the ruins of the Gunung Kawi Temple Complex. He took us up to Mt Batur lookout where we had a pleasant lunch with a stunning view of the volacano and crater lake. After lunch it was off to an agro tourism mixed crop plantation where we had coffee and tea tasting. Wonderful tastes. It was also a lesson in sustainable agriculture. It was a good place to buy edible presents. It is slightly more expensive than in Kuta but you know the money goes straight to the producers. We then went to Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple where there were many rituals happening. To finish off the trip we visted the Tegallantang Rice terraces. These were all stunning places which also were much more alive because Ketut Mawa made them come to life to describe some of the subtleties of Balinese life.We finished our day at 5.30pm quite enriched by this taste of Balinese life thanks to Ketut. Long life and success to Ketut in his efforts."

Everything we had read here about Nyoman is true -- he speaks excellent English, has a well-functioning vehicle which is driven safely, will customize your day to whatever you want to do, is interesting, knowledgeable, and fun. Our day was packed with activity and sight-seeing, but I think what we enjoyed most was chatting with Nyoman and comparing our cultures. I can't recommend this tour highly enough. Nyoman was always looking out for our best interests. It made getting around, seeing the sights, and learning about Bali easy and stress-free. A few highlights for us: meeting the family including Nyoman's wife and beautiful babies, having the best meal of our stay in Bali at a roadside restaurant that we would never be able to find again, and driving home in a torrential thunderstorm and almost no visibility (made it back safely!)."

A friend I met in Bali recommended his friend Ketut as a tour guide, because I was looking for a low key, low stress, easy day of touring and had specific places in mind. Ketut was very friendly, down to earth, and has a wonderful command of the English language, and we shared language tips and phrases. He was able to teach me many aspects of Balinese culture beyond what I had expected or would have thought to ask, as well as followed up on anything he taught me to make sure I remembered. I had asked Ketut if I could bring my Balinese friend - who turned out to be a childhood friend of Ketut's, and so that brought another element of delight to the day as the friend had not seen much of what we did, either. The friend took my camera and took many delightful pictures for and of me. Ketut completely tailored the day to match whatever I felt like doing and had suggestions as well. He drove me through countryside, we stopped at small stands, we went to temples, rice fields, a traditional (not tourist) market, and even stopped by the side of a road to try Durian fruit. He did the bargaining for me when I did not feel up to it.Next time I come to Bali I will hire Ketut for several days and get around the island more. I did hire him to take me to the airport the day I left as well.Prices were right for what is the 'going rate' in Bali. He had bottled water for me and was very willing to stop when I was hungry, thirsty, or to find a local warung for coffee. He communicated with me constantly and made sure every thing was as I desired. I felt very happy with the entire experience."

The night before our tour, he phoned us at the hotel and started apologizing profusely, saying that because his six-month-old twins were having their hair-cutting ceremony the next day, he had to send his uncle, Wayan, to take us on the tour instead. To compensate, he invited us to his house to watch some of the ceremony, and it turned out to be the high point of our stay! Nyoman and his family live in a traditional Balinese family compound (and have done so since 1860!) and his father is one of the three priests in their village, so it was a real honour and privilege to be present at the ceremony, which was, like other things in Bali, very focused and precise but yet entirely relaxed and unpompous. The tour with Uncle Wayan was wonderful too (my 76-year-old mum was inspired to climb all 350 steps down and UP to see Gunung Kawi temple, and was still smiling at the end). I learned a lot about Balinese culture from both Wayan and Nyoman, and would book another tour with them in a heartbeat."

He brought my wife, daughter and myself on a really interesting and insightful tour that started in Ubud and brought us to some of the best sights in Bali.The day began with a trip to the Monkey Forest. We enjoyed a walk around the forest where we were able to get really close to the monkeys. They are really very tame although I did see them going to a few people and trying to take food out of their bags. If you have food they will come and take it off you. From there we traveled to Lake Bratan to see the Ulun Danu Temple which is located on the shores of Lake Bratan surrounded by beautiful gardens. On the way we took a brief break at a coffee and coco plantation to stretch our legs and taste some freshly ground balinese coffee. They have a number of types of coffee and tea available for tasting and a cup of the world famous Luwak coffee can be purchased for $4.Thoroughly recommended. Following this we headed to the Jatiluwih Rice Terraces and lunch in the Wr Dhea restaurant. The food here was absolutely beautiful and offered great value for money. This restaurant cooks meals to order unlike a lot of the premises along the way which have a buffet so you know what you get will be good. After this we made our way to Tanah Lot Temple located on the coast. This was the last stop of the day and from there we returned to out hotel in Ubud.Throughout the day Nyoman was a fountain of information. He explained the history of each of the sites we visited as well as telling us about many of the Balinese traditions we came across during the day. He was an excellent tour guide and a true gentleman. He is a man with immense knowledge of the island and its ways of life. He takes great joy in telling people of the Balinese way of life and he strives to ensure that your tour is a truly wonderful experience. Thank you Nyoman for a great day."

We had a large group of 12 people so we had both Nyoman and Ketut as our tour guides for both days. We had opted for customised tours and had sent a wishlist to Nyoman beforehand so he can plan the best route. Our first day we told him we wanted to visit Ubud and have lunch at the famous Ibu Oka. On the way to Ubud, Nyoman was full of information about Bali and the local life and going ons. He was very patient with answering our questions and would answer any questions we had. Due to very heavy rain after lunch, we were unable to continue further north as the roads were getting dangerous to navigate.Our second day we went to a coffee plantation, Bratan temple, Jatilwah rice terrace and Tanah Lot. We even made impromptu stops on the side of the road at fruit stalls to load up on durians and mangosteens. One of the best Balinese food we had was at the rice terrace at a local restaurant recommended by Nyoman instead of the touristy buffet restaurant further up the road. This little restaurant was situated literally next to the rice field where you go up to the rice plants and touch them.Nyoman and Ketut were both very friendly and eager to show off their country. They are very informative and know alot about Bali traditions and everyday life. They even told us about their family and village where they live. There are still so many places in Bali that we wish to visit. Next time we will definitley be booking with Nyoman and Ketut."

Our tour guide was confirmed as Ketut and i am sure he is just as good! he and Nyoman are cousins who run the business together and he was absolutely fantastic. he has such a wonderful personality that we instantly felt comfortable with him, his english is also excellent. we booked the Bedugul tour but we really wanted to see Tanah Lot for sunset and were happy to miss out on one of the other temples instead but Ketut took us to all 3 temples for no extra charge! he thought that we would have a better understanding of Bali if we saw all 3 and i am so glad we did. Ketut was great at explaining everything to us but not overloading us with information so that we did not remember it. his sense of humour is great and we spent so much time having fun, after we visited a location he would ask us some questions about what he had told us like a pop quiz to see if we remembered and i am so grateful of this, he made sure we had understood and remembered all the important things. he answered every question we had about everything and is so much detail. Ketut has a university diploma in english and hindu traditional culture/religion which makes him so knowledgeable and because he is so enthusiastic and absolutely loves everything that he is giving us infirmation about it is so easy to learn and take it in, he is a natural teacher and people person. He shared a lot about his life with us which was something we didnt get anywhere else, we could ask him any question and he would answer, he is a very wise a perceptive man for such a young age and you can tell he has a lot of respect for people and nature. he is also the best driver we had in Bali!the places we visited on out tour are as followsTaman Ayun temple, Coffee plantation, local market, buffet lunch in the mountains, Ulan Danu temple, rice terraces, Tanah Lot templeyou could fit more into one day if you wanted but we preferred to spend more time at a location and see less places rather than more, also we stayed in seminyak which is quite a drive and we started at 10am. we would have liked to see a school but since our tour was on sunday we could not as school is not on, on sunday. we did not get to see a ceremony at all as there were not many on, Ketut explained that today was a special day on the balinese calendar where most people spend the day at a body of water, beach, river, lake to celebrate. instead he told us in depth about the different temple ceremonies they have and what they do to prepare and celebrate. as we were on our honeymoon he also told us all about their weddings which was very interesting and next time we are in Bali he wants to organise for us to see a Balinese wedding, we will take him up on this offer if we go back.the coffee plantation was not just coffee either, they also grow cocoa, jackfruit, snakeskin fruit, tumerick, ginger, lemongrass and much more! he explained their uses and how they are processed and showed us all the plants and the produce. we got to taste a variety of coffees and teas and cocoa for free with no pressure to buy. they also have some Luwak animals there which are so cute!when we went to the market Ketut showed us different things that Balinese people use in everyday life and what the stalls were selling. he bought some snakeskin fruit for himself as it was his favourite and was offering it to us to eat all day, he wanted to share literally everything he had with us!when we went to the rice terraces, we were taking photos from the lookout where most people were, i heard another lady ask her tour guide if she could driver through to the other side to take photos and he told her that it would cost 10 000rp per person to go over there, we asked Ketut if we could go to the other side and he said yes no mention of the charge, when we went to the entrance he just paid the 20 000 for the two of us and gave us the tickets, he did not even try to get us to pay where as other tour guides were saying entry was not included in their tour and you have to pay, not that it is a lot of money but Ketut paid for all entry costs wherever we went and was happy to take us to places which were not strictly on the tour we booked. after Tanah Lot where we watched the sunset it was dark and we were thinking that thats the end of the tour but Ketut asked us if there was anything else we wanted to see, he was still happy to take us to see other things! we said that we were happy to go back to our villa and if he wanted we would pay for him to come out to dinner with us. he politely declined because he had to go to the hospital to see his Aunt who had given birth to her first child that day! It was amazing that he was still offering to take us places after Tanah Lot even thought he didn't have to and he had other important places to be!i would definitely recommend booking a tour with Bali Traditional Tours, if we had gone to these places ourselves we would not know anything about the significance of them and we were able to appreciate them so much more with everything that Ketut told to us. we had an incredible day and this was definitely the best tour we did. If we go back to Bali we will book another tour with Ketut to see other places for sure."

This man has studied in history and religion and knows his stuff. He also easily understands the most complicated of questions and is able to answer your questions without hesitation. No language barriers. He is polite, his car is immaculate and to top it all off he is a lovely, friendly, honest and reliable person. A pleasure and an honour to meet you Nyoman. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Best wishes to you and your family from Leah and Paul Australia."

He answered all of our questions and really helped us feel connected to the amazing people of Bali. We were able to customize our tour to what we wanted to see for a very reasonable price. We spent a day touring on our own, and our time with Ketut was what was really memorable and educational. I give this tour my highest recommendation!"

Basedon the positive reviews, I booked with Nyoman.He was helpful over the the internet even before we arrived in Bali with suggestions for what we could do on our day tour. When the actual day came, Nyoman was on time and dressed in Traditional Balinese gear. He spoke English very well and immediately we felt comfortable with him. His Car was spacious, clean and air conditioned. He is also a reliable driver.Nyoman is a lovely young bloke that works hard and knows Bali intimately. He has a great sense of humour and it proud of his island. he will teach you things you never knew and will answer any questions you could dream up. He even learnt some choice Aussie slang that we taught him. So watch out if he lays it on when he find out you are from Australia!!We had a great day and we bought him lunch as he was just so nice. It was very cheap and delicious.We saw the Unesco rice paddies, temples, village festivals lot lots more. I highly reccomend this personal and entertaining day trip. Nyoman works for his family and not some big tour organisation. He deserves the great reviews and if I go back to Bali I will probably look him up again."

It was our first trip to Bali and we wanted to see as much as we could. All three of our tours were fantastic. The first tour was with Nyoman ( Nyoman Grago's uncle). the tour was very good and Nyoman was very informative. I would recommend tours with him.However, our second two tours were with Nyoman Grago and they were even more wonderful. We felt like Nyoman was a friend that we had known for a long time. He is so friendly and helpful and he makes it very easy to spend the day with him talking and exploring Bali. I don't know if I have ever met a kinder person with more energy and excitement for life. The highlight of our 2 weeks in Bali were our two days with Nyoman. Particularly when we visited his home. His whole family was very kind and his new twin babies are beautiful. I even got to hold his beautiful daughter. The fact the he welcomed us into his home like old friends was so gracious. It was also a great way to experience true Balinese living.Overall the tours were great. Nyoman was wonderful. He is very knowledgeable and speaks wonderful English. Probably the best English we encountered on our whole trip. We felt like we didn't just have a good tour, that we made a friend. THANK YOU Nyoman for a great experience. - with love, Jen and Eric"

Travelling with two young children from the US, we wanted everything booked in advance. As Kutut as our guide, we discovered Bali in a very intimate, personal way. Ketut provided a wealth of information about the Balinese religion, socioeconomic structure, culture, ceremonies and daily life. He accommodated all of our special needs with kids with patience, kindness, and gentleness toward our children and ourselves. The more interested we became to explore Bali, the more eager he became to teach us and show us around, often changing the itinerary and going off the beaten path to give us a more authentic experience. In fact, we felt so connected to him, we added on an additional day and he drove us to the airport with gracious farewells. There is no doubt that we will return to Bali as it is one of the most special places we have been. We cannot wait to visit with Ketut and experience more of Bali with his tours."

We went to Royal temple at Pura Taman Ayun, the rice terraces at Jatiluwih (where we had an excellent lunch) ending up on the coast at Tanah Lot temple. On the way Nyoman noticed a ceremony in a small town, and produced 2 sarongs from the car so we could enter the courtyard. We were welcomed by the local people ( we were the only tourists ) and had a fantastic hour listening to the female musicians Gamelan band. For $70 dollars this was a bargain!. Our tour was not a set tour, I think you can suggest your own itinerary..to suit yourself, providing no-one else is on board. Nyoman was good company, knowledgeable, helpful and his English was excellentWe cannot recommend this highly enough."

Lake Bratan and the herons returning to roost) but he stopped off along the way so we could watch the kids at their sunday Gamelan class . He also took us to the rice terraces - a world heritage site. All entrance fee's were included and all for the fee of $75 for the 6 of us!!! Tip generously, we hired him again for half a day and he had to shell out for a 'fine' for the police and then we found out that over half of what he was charging us was going on the car hire!!! From that you can gather it was lovely air-con people carrier!! Two fab days out - don't hesitate to book and have a real inside take on to Bali life !!"

They displayed flexibility from the offset and provided a cattered program that allowed my family of grownups to fully enjoy every moment of the day they spent out and about. Our guide, Ketut, was extremely patient and didn't mind repeating the information he provided us with on the Balinese culture, mainly around theirs religion. He allowed us to seize opportunities that arise during the tour, to get closer with the population involved in cultural activities. He adapted the program, based on our expectations, avoiding redundancy where we didn't want it, and allowing it for activities we liked doing. He provided very good advice on the \"clean\" restaurant, and brought us to those that provided extra, such as a stunning view on rice terrasses and Mount & Lake Batur; on the beach, directly on the side of rice fields, etc. For souvenirs, he brought us to family owned businesses, which were not as expensive as those targetting the mass tourism. In the local markets, he made suggestions about what we could try. He brought us to a temple where a colony of monkeys resided, which were a lot less aggressive than the ones in reknown places. This provided a very close encounter with them, along with the giant fruit-eating bats. He was very proactive in proposing to take family photos and knew exactly where to take them to have the best effect. In a sum, he allowed to fully optimise the little time we had to see as much as possible of Bali. On top of it, he does support good causes with the children. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company. They are excellent, and extremely cheap considering what they provide."

He was late to pick us up and was not organised as it seemed he had little notice that he was doing our tour. It was school holidays when we were there and we didnt get to go to a school which was just unfortunate but we also didnt get to see a local market and our tour guide also did not take us to Ulun Danu Batur Temple and its neighbor Pura Pucak Tuluk Biyu which I didnt realise until after I looked at the itinarary.The tour also included a visit to a local cultural event and a Balinese household which also didnt happen.What we did see we enjoyed but as I stated at the start I was hoping to really love this tour but I really could have got any driver to take us to the places we did get to see for a lot less money and it would have been the same. This tour was average and I could not recommend this tour as we missed seeing so much of the \"Traditional Bali\" that I was looking forward to."

We enjoyed his detailed explanations of the sights, the traditions and customs of Balinese daily life. We visited a school and local markets as well as the main attractions. It was fun to spend our days travelling with Ketut because at the end of each tour, he asked us to remember what we had seen at each sight. We jotted down some notes on each temple/ sight so that we could answer correctly. He is a great asset to Traditional Tours. The tours offered are personalized and suited to traveler who want an understanding of the history, traditions and village life in Bali.

Any of the planned trips on their site are great or if you want you can customize the things you want to do. We hired them for two days (~$80 USD/dy), but wish we would have for more days. We went to several of the sites off his listed tours and other things we wanted to see. When he says he is your personal guide he means it. One of the really interesting things we did was the kecak dance and while other guides just herded in their clients in, Nyomen walked us to our seats and then brought us bottled waters during the show as it was extremely hot as we were packed in the large crowd. To add to the real experience we were invited to his home to see his family's humble compound with several family units and their own temple (as Bali is the land of 3 million temples). There are so many temples with unique features to see so one will have to explore these for themselves. Other notable things were the Monkey forest in Ubud and Ubud itself.

All three of us enjoyed our first day-long tour so much that we decided to spend four more days with Ketut and with Nyoman! Their English is excellent, their vehicles are very comfortable, and there is really no question they cannot answer--abour Balinese dance, religion, food, family, geography, and history (both are well-read and university-educated),They took exceptionally good care of us, determining right from the start what we knew and what we wanted to know--even what foods our kids liked (and didn't like) and what they wanted to do. They then made a careful plan and discussed it with us, and planned everything with impressive effeciency. We met teachers and kids in a local village school (this was so much fun and very memorable for our kids), got to listen to gamelan music at local cafes (where the food was great and not on the tourist trail), and enjoyed ice-cream with local children. Our kids learned more detail about volcanoes than they bargained for, and we are now speaking just enough Balinese to access places and people we just couldn't meet before. Their vehicles are very comfortable and safe. They know where to find the souvenirs we wanted, and which sights we should see--at what times and in what order, given traffic and road conditions.So much of our trip was spent with these two.

On our second day in Bali we spent the day with Nyoman doing the South Bali Uluwatu tour. Nyoman is fabulous! He answered all of our questions and showed us a side of Bali that I think many Australians miss completely. Nyoman looked after us and made every site we visited a pleasure. We were so impressed that we booked him to take us on the Kintamani Tour a few days later. Another wonderful day. Do yourself a favour - if you want to understand Balinese culture and see some of the most beautiful places in Bali, then go with Nyoman. Unforgettable!!"

We had only left with a little amount of money so we had no money for lunch( due to there being no atms around that area) and he gave us $500,000 rup no worries i was astounded by his kindness and we gave him a tip and asked him to have lunch with us ( We are not the type of people who let our tour operators sit in the car while we eat). He has so much knowledge of the culture and has a fantastic personality. We enjoyed every single moment on this tour and the next time we come to Bali we will be booking further tours with him. We went to the coffee plantation , Gunung Kawi Temple, Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple and Kintamani . At the Holy water temple Nyoman showed us how to be apart of the culture by showing us what to do when the priest blesses you. It was not only great value for money but we will remember this for a lifetime :)"

A trip to Bali would not be complete without spending time on a personalized tour with Nyoman.

This trip to Bali was predominantly a SCUBA diving holiday but we did want to experience some of the Balinese culture so stayed 3 nights in Ubud before heading to the dive regions of Tulamben & Menjangan Island.On our first day in Ubud we did the Bedugul Tour with Nyoman Grago of Bali Traditional Tours. He had also arranged our airport transfers to Ubud by private car on the previous afternoon. Nyoman is both guide and driver; a very friendly, professional & knowledgeable young man whose English is excellent. We visited a primary school, a traditional fruit & vegetable market at Bedugul, Pura Ulun Danu Temple which is located on Lake Bratan, and the beautiful Taman Ayun Mangwi Temple, as well as a tea & coffee plantation. Nyoman even took us to his home to meet his family. Nothing was too much trouble and the tour was great value as rate is per car not per person. Would use again and happy to recommend to anyone."

Before I left on my trip I did alot of research on Tours and through Trip Advisory I learnt about a gentleman named Nyoman form Bali Traditional Tours, all the reviews written about him were lovely so I was interested and eager in experiencing a Tour with him during my time in BaliWhen I went to Bali I never in a million years expected to find a friend, and that is exactly what Nyoman has become to me and my family. Nyoman was the best part of our trip and not just because he was our paid tour guide but because Nyoman is both honest and thoughtful and so beautiful on this inside, we were able to experience The Real Bali and had your site not existed we would have never met the man who definately changed my life.We could never say enough positive things about Nyoman or what he now means to us but I will say this - If you are travelling to Bali and you want to experience it with an honest, respectful, happy, humble, kind and beautiful soul look no further Nyoman is who you need!!Thank you Nyoman for taking care of us, for teaching us about what life in Bali is really like. Thank you for sharing your stories and listening to ours, thank you for your smile and making us smile but more than all of the above thank you for teaching me what's important in life. I live in a very beautiful house, I drive a nice car and I have a great job but I have not been so happy, you don't have any of the things I have and yet you smile and laugh and love every day - because of you Nyoman I now know what's important, meeting you has changed my life.We love you, and we love Bali - Wyarn (Donna) Wyarn (Miki) and Ketut (Carmen) xx"

In addition, he took us to the famous rice terraces of Bali, as well as a number of temple grounds and to meet with a real medicine man.

At Pura Tirtha Empul (Holy Spring Temple), we were fortunate to see 2 mating snakes which, according to Nyoman, was extremely lucky if he could touch them with any personal clothing. Although he didn\u2019t managed to, we were glad to have shared the exciting moment with him! Nyoman was very patient with our 4 children and answered all their questions clearly. As the kids were not too interested in temples, he suggested other places to visit and was even generous to invite us to visit his own home! He introduced us to his extended family as well as explained the residential layout to us. It was the highlight of our trip for the kids to handle day-old chicks and see the family\u2019s very clean pigs! If you need transport just to bring you shopping or to beaches, any private drivers will do. But if you are visiting temples, rice terraces, mountains, etc, I highly recommend Nyoman. His knowledge, cheerfulness and warmth made the experience so much more interesting and enjoyable. We left Bali with a better understanding of the culture of its people. Thank you, Nyoman."

Before our family (myself , wife and two sons aged 16 and 11) trip to Bali I found reviews of Bali Traditional Tours here on Tripadvisor and emailed Nyoman to book 3 separate day tours. The replies were prompt and friendly and all was booked up ready for us to arrive. Like others here I was a bit doubtful that it could be that good given the very modest price.So on the day of the first tour, our guide Ketut arrived to pick us up at our villa. At first I was a little disappointed that the legendary Nyoman had not arrived but this feeling was soon dispelled as Ketut turned out to be an extremely charming, friendly, knowledgeable and overall excellent guide.So we went out on three full day trips with Ketut. These were the Bedugul tour, the Kintamani tour and the South Bali tour. All of these I would highly recommend.The tours involve visiting many temples where the entrance is included in the tour price. Ketut seemed to know everything about all of the temples we visited and also filled us in with a lot of detail about Balinese life which was most welcome. Also provided were the sarongs needed to enter some temples. Many of the temple sites are stunning and unmissable but I will not go into the detail here.Other highlights included a coffee plantation (where you can taste the famous luak coffee made from beans that pass through the digestive system of a civet cat).Another interesting spot was a temple with monkey and giant fruit bats which you can handle.The final trip finished up at Uluwatu temple where at sunset we saw the famous Kecak dance performed (there is an additinal charge for the entrance to this). This is a stunning performance which must not be missed.At all times Ketut was kind and helpful. He did not takes us to places to buy stuff which some guides do. Indeed wherever we were he advised us on what we should do when approached by sellers and what would be fair prices. Invalluable information.Overall I could not recommend this company more. The transport is a high quality air conditioned Toyota. The price if fantastic. The guide is superb and the locations you are taken to are unbeatable.Thankyou Ketut (and Nyoman) and hope to see you again some day."

Ketut is simply amazing - his English is excellent, he is kind, funny, and professional. Ketut listened carefully to what we wanted to see and then made it all happen. He met us at our hotel, treated us with great respect, brought along sarongs for our temple visits, and was well versed in Hindu/Balinese culture and traditions. Our conversations were both educational and enjoyable. We had used other drivers in Ubud - but often felt we lost so much of the richness of the culture because of our language differences.

When we eventually met and got to know him we found him to be young (mid 20's I would guess), very polite, with a university education that included religious studies, good looking and seemingly known to everyone in the areas we visited. Each day was long, around 10-12 hours. He took us to so many temple events that we would not have otherwise seen and explained all of our questions about Hindu rituals and beliefs. Most of the time we were off the tourist beaten track and that is how we like it.We bought him lunch to eat with us each day and he was genuinely grateful as I think that the sons of rice farmers do not eat out much if at all. He brings an innocence, a freshness and a graceful charm to the sometimes jaded and routine business of tour guiding.We would not hesitate to recommend him to you. His tours are very reasonable in price. Do not miss meeting and getting to know Nyoman."

His knowledge of the culture, not to mention he's education in reading and understanding Sanskrit allows for him to review the Hindu calendar for special events and festivals in the region. This, as it would turn out is a rare ability, and would be particularly important as we were able to attend a festival in one village that happens every thirty five years!   We moved our tour days around his schedule which upon his suggestions would turn into the most memorable events each day we met. Festivals, Cremation ceremonies, specialty tours around East Bali including the Bali Aga ( 11th Century Hindu settlement ) at Tengenan Village. His tours we're fascinating and his explanations rich with detail and a delight. Don't miss this one if you have the opportunity.

We saw a side of Bali that we did not know existed, Nyoman took us to temples and explained to us what everything meant and the traditions behind the ceremonies we where lucky to see a ceremony at a small local temple which is only performed every 35 years, we would never have seen the things we did without Nyoman. He is so friendly and truly passionate about his country and showing it to visitors. His knowledge of history and religion is amazing but at the same time he is funny and very entertaining to be with.Nyoman customised the two tours for us after we explained what we wanted to see and do. We travelled in air-conditioned comfort in a very nice 4 wheel drive. I would highly recommend the elephant safari park in Ubud, where we fed baby elephants. We saw Mount Kintamani which is normally covered in clouds but on the day we went the sky was clear, it was an incredable sight, Lake Bratan is another sight not to be missed, it has a temple built on the water. the only disapointment was Tahah Lot Temple, while this is a very holy temple to the people of Bali the crowds of tourists at sunset spoil the atmosphere,there are everywhere. I feel I have made a new friend in Bali and will book Nyoman again on our next trip to Bali."

Though we were only with him for 1 day, he seems like a long time friend of ours. He takes good care of us (group consisting of 11 person aged 8-76). We enjoyed our time with him throughout our Kintamani Tour. We have no regrets engaging Nyoman."

We're not very experienced travellers (this was our first visit to Asai) and were not really confident about travelling around on our own. I found the reviews of Bali Traditional Tours on trip advisor and (having read some not-so-good reviews of other tour companies in Bali) decided to contact Nyoman to see whether he was available. We booked the Kintamani Tour but Nyoman amended it to include the Monkey Forest that we were keen to visit. The minute I met Nyoman in the foyer of our hotel, I knew we were going to have a fantastic time. Such a friendly lad with excellent English. He immediately put us both at ease. The tour was brilliant. Nyoman's knowledge of his culture and religion is fascinating. We were so thrilled that we ended up booking another two tours with Bali Traditional Tours during our time in Bali. The tours really were the highlight of our trip.We've read other reviews of tours in Bali where people are constantly taken to different shops (woodcarving, jewellery etc,) and encouraged to buy things by the guide (so he can get commission). This will NOT happen with Bali Traditional Tours. Nyoman did take us to one woodcarving shop because we specifically asked him to. However, he gave us advice about bargaining to get a good price and told us that we should not feel pressured to buy anything unless we want to. Nyoman is a genuinely lovely young man who is keen to show tourists the best that the island has to offer. I have already recommended Bali Traditional Tours to two of my friends.Thanks for making our trip so special Nyoman!"

We covered many temples, villages, physical sites, rice paddies, etc. Always prompt and always accomodating (he provided umbrellas and clothing needed to enter temples), Nyoman was very flexible and picked some special ceremonies, that occur very infrequently. At one temple we met the Regent and that was fun! We even worshipped with him in the mother termple, Besakih. He provided the history and culture of his wonderful island and people. He even sang to us and put on the head of a pig to show us he he could dance. It was a great four days- thanks so much, Nyoman!"

Before the trip, their responses to my emails were fast and very informative helping us to make the best decisions about what to see on our first trip to Bali. Whilst we were in Bali the team were punctual and very personable.On the first day we did the Bedugul Tour with Nyomen. The trip was varied with lots of different elements of Balinese life but best of all it was a private tour. This gave us loads of opportunity to talk to Nyomen our guide about life in Bali. In addition to the 'set' tour Nyomen also took us to a temple that was having a celebration that takes place only once in every 35 years. We really feel that we learnt lots about balinese culture and life in general Nyomen gave us a real insight into Bali - something that we wouldn't have got on a big group tour.On the second day we had a Custom Tour where we decided the things that we wanted to see. In fact we didn't chose enough to fill the day but Ketut our guide added sights to the tour as we went along making this a second great day.Bali Traditional Tours offer great value for money and a really personal service. They made us feel very special and we would definitely choose them again."

Before departing, i researched tour companies online. i chose Bali Traditional Tours because it seemed to feature more of the real life of the Balinese. i was not disappointed. Our guide, Nyoman is a gentle soul, full of pride in his country and culture. Along with an inside look at the myriad, fantastic temples, we were treated to a family run coffee plantation (where we tasted some very \"special\" coffee), a primary school (where my daughter had a real chance to exchange with children her own age), we helped make Balinese sea salt, held and fed a giant bat... the experiences went on and on. What started as a single day tour, turned into 5 days together with custom tours, special stops and a real insiders look at the island and its beautiful people. Nyoman took special care to always include my daughter, teaching her about each place, the Gods and Goddesses, and the village customs and celebrations. We spent much time laughing at the vast differences between New York and Bali. I cannot recommend Bali Traditional Tours enough. Their kindness and care is a window to the spirit of this magical place."

He was particularly good at keeping our teenagers happy and engaged. (Never an easy task!) He also went above and beyond the call of duty. Our airline tickets had to be couriered to Bali, but since we did not know what day they would arrive, we didn't know where to have them delivered. Nyoman had them sent to his home and personally delivered them to us. That kind of dedication and service is sums up why we were so happy to spend our time with Nyoman and his company."

Try this tour guide there is heaps to see on the Island and the roads are difficult to try on your own.  The guide at Bali Traditional Tours - Nyomam was excellent. He had an assistant driver in a very comfortable sedan vehicle fully air conditioned. We started early 8:30am and got back at about 6:30pm. The tour was full of 4 major temple visits. A visit to a farm in the jungle with coffee & tea & cocoa tasting. Yes also the Luwak coffee, I didn't like it but loved the ginger tea. Saw fruits never seen before. Also spices not seen growing and a great \"lost\" sort of wonderland. Ate lunch (not included in the tour) at a well recommended restaurant by the guide, that felt like it was on top of the world. Had a view of the volcano & lake while having an incredible fresh meal with a difference. Bali food is great! Highly recommend you try it.  Nyoman took care of all the special needs of a tourist - the sarong when required, water, he took care of all entrance fees and parking fees quickly and smoothly you hardly knew it was taking place. Bali rice farmers at work and their great terraced rice Paddie fields.  Nyoman is a great ambassador of his religion and was very helpful in explaining everything. He treasurers his home and it certainly rubs off on you.  So get away from the beach and city and really see Bali with Nyoman - I am so glad I found him.  Enjoy your Tour, I know you will."

            "review": "bali traditional tours. This is my second trip to bali and i agree that with some other reviewers here that one option to see the real bali is to hire a driver and go visit the various tourist sites in this isle of the Gods. I am a season traveller and am not a fan of cookier cutter type of tours which take on literally busloads of tourist and shuttle from one site to another without seeing the real people and the real countryside. So it was a pleasant surprise (and i dare say so too with some luck) that i stumbled on this outfit through google search - 'balitraditionaltours' and the itinerary was unique and very localised with a stop at a local primary school and various temples and rice fields on the outfields of ubud. It started with a friendly welcome from nyoman, pronounced as 'norman' who picked me up from the hotel and communication was easy as he spoke fluent english and displayed a great deal of knowledge about balinese culture. Apart from nyoman he has other friends who can provide tour services in french and spanish. Nyoman is a local graduate from bali who studied balinese history and culture and it was his understanding of customs and culture that made the outing very memorable. Our first stop is a local primary school and balinese kids and their teachers are welcoming to visitors in true balinese hospitality. For those of you who really want to get to know the locals this is a heart warming way to make friends (albeit young friends) and kids being kids are not camera shy to have their pictures taken. I suppose many of them dont get visitors often and to them we tourists are the real 'tourist attraction'We moved on to the Bedugul temple and it was a special holy day and there was much to see with the beautiful processions and 'gamelan' music accompanying the villagers into the temple. An awesome sight to behold rich in colour, reverance and significance. All through this while, nyoman provided indepth explanations of the customs, how he too worships at this temple with his village. Before long, you do feel you are in the company of a local friend and not just a guide as he shares his own personal experiences going through the rituals and the significance of the events bears to him, this does give you a better and unique insight to the real balinese people.The journey north into the breathtaking rice fields of Jatiluwih pronounced as 'jut-tee-loo-wee' is really picture perfect and for those of you who romanticise on visiting asia to see the rice terraces, this is one place worth seeing. It gives one a sense of serenity and tranquil strolling in the rice fields. I will be glad to recommend this outfit to anyone who is looking to see the real soul of bali and meet its local people in the process. That is really the spirit of travels and not visits to shopping outlets with hordes of other tourists. This is an independent company and nyoman who is both manager and guide offers one the flexibility to adjust the tour according to your preferred interest. I enjoy photography so having made my interest known, there was no shortage of picturesque stops to suit me. Transportation was in a comfortable and new 4x4 vehicle which given the balinese terrain is comfortable yet robust enough to navigate the winding roads where no big tour buses can pass. So in short, for those of you who want an off the beaten path experience in bali with a professional, knowledgeable, extrememly friendly and warm guide as your friend, i will highly recommend balitraditionaltours."

My wife put a post up on \"Bali Bogans\" an Australian Facebook group seeking a Tour Guide and Driver for her 'Nerd Husband'. Mr.Bedu was highly recommended. I'm actually a Social Science & Drama Teacher and as such was seeking an honest look at Bali, Indonesia from a locals perspective. Through out the day I pestered Mr. Bedu with questions on culture, social issues, politics, religion and gender roles throughout our day was fantastic. His command of English, understanding of why I was asking these things and patience with my need to stop and photograph things was much appreciated. My review is written with some bias. Although it was only a one day tour and it was a professional arrangement it is hard not to become friends with Mr. Bedu. His love for his country, its people and his casual and polite manner is hard not to befriend. He know a lot of locals of course, enjoys a joke and ok me to some truly sensational places. Waterfalls, plantations, rice terraces, monkey forests, little villages, busy roads and temples and all in a few short hours. Regardless of if you are travelling alone or in a small group of 5 or 6 I have no doubt you will be satisfied with this young mans knowledge, organisation, professionalism and cleanliness. The car is well cared for, reliable and clearly a symbol of pride for him. I am certain he will not disappoint and works hard to remain flexible and yet ensure the best experience given the changeable conditions of the region. Lastly I would like share his recommendation which I will follow on my next visit. Often tourists first visit is centred around Kuta which is essentially the beach strip and 'tourist party central'. Mr. Bedu suggested that next time we look at say 3 or 4 days of the week being located in or near Ubud which is central to the island and the artisan and cultural hub of Bali. Of course there are still a lot of tourists but it's also central to Tourist ventures such as the Monkeys, Elephants, sunrise over the Volcano, ATV adventures, rafting and other such persuits where as if you are at Kuta these are an hour drive or more away. Follow up the trip with 3 or 4 days in Kuta, a much busier and touristy experience which is also close to the airport for a stress free departure. Well, as stress free as Bali traffic can be. Being close means less chance of being held up for a flight trying to get through the city. All in all a most amazing experience and a single day with Mr. Bedu was enough of a taste of Bali to secure my return in the future. I have no hesitation recommending him for day or even an extended trip. If I could make one more suggestion and that would be book him early as I have no doubt this young man will be certainly an asset who will be in high demand during the peak seasons. Well done Mr. Bedu on providing such a professional and affordable service for those which to experience the best Bali has to offer."

Having never visited Bali before, I looked to the internet and hired Mr. Bedu as our tour guide for an airport pickup and drive to Ubud, Mount Batur trek and day tour. I'm sure that I asked so many questions that I started to become annoying but he remained patient and answered all of my questions before my arrival in Bali and during our stay in Bali. During our stay in Ubud, we ended up deciding to do an additional last minute day tour with another driver to West Bali because Bedu was not available. The driver got us to the places we asked but did not take the time to explain what we were seeing or make recommendations on nearby attractions. We later learned that we had missed an important landmark on that side of the island! We may never get to see it again!In contrast, our experience with Bedu was so different. Even though our airport pickup was at 1am and our plane was delayed, he happily chatted with us all the way to Ubud and made itinerary, restaurant recommendations - all of which were spot on. On our other trips, not only did he get us to the places we were interested in, he came into temples with us and explained what we were looking at and explained the culture, which really helped us understand and appreciate what we were visiting. He also recommended a few optional stops that we took advantage of as well! By the way, I have yet to meet another Balinese person with better English skills - he is always clear when he speaks and understands you very easily. His rates were reasonable and the best value for the service you are receiving in Bali. He went above and beyond - he booked our Gili transfers for us and even called the company for us when the shuttle bus pickup was late. Thanks for everything Bedu. You made the start to our Bali honeymoon memorable. If you're ever in Vancouver, I'll take you to our whiskey bar ;). Cheers."

Literally anything we needed was not a problem for Mr Bedu - before getting to our hotel we headed for a quick supermarket shop, and we chatted most of the way home (although Mr Bedu was also sensitive to our long journey and also let us nap in his comfortable car for a little while when the jet lag hit).Along with our airport transfers, we also hired Mr Bedu for a number of day tours in Bali - one to Seminyak, Bali Safari Park, and an Ubud day tour. Mr Bedu always wants you to get the best out of your time in Bali, and suggested an alternative tour to what we had selected, because he wants to share the culture of Bali with you - and we're so glad we took his advice!

Great driver and tour guide, very professional and reliable, and has a quality, clean car/van. But, the main reason I recommend him to my friends when they visit Bali is because he has awesome English and is very relatable and fun. So you don't feel like a real tourist, more like your mate is taking you around :)"

He helped me create a perfect day for my children and me to finalize our last full day in Bali. He helped to make sure I didn't miss anything on my list of things to do. He also suggested the Batubulan village to see Barong and Keris dance. This was one of the BEST things we did on our entire trip. It was so entertaining, the costumes were beautiful, the kids loved it! He took us places to learn how the local crafts were created, but in no way were we obligated to purchase anything. However, if you do want to shop, these are reputable people to buy from. He chose a beautiful lunch spot for us (even with buy one get one free mixed drinks for mom ). He drove safely and even helped with my children. He never made me feel rushed or a trouble in any way. He is so kind and friendly, and his car is easy to spot! lol! If he is the only driver you have during your entire time in and around Ubud- you won't regret it! Wish we had had him the whole time! Thanks for a great day Bedu!!"

While we were going round temples we saw other tourists who had just been dumped there by their guide and given no information on the rituals, and other aspects of Balinese life. What a waste of a journey. By contrast Mr Bedu was there to explain things that needed explains but didn't butt in when we didn't need him. We also did not get any sense we were being driven from one \" shopping opportunity\" to another - he took time to find out what we were interested in and took us there.

He's lived in Bali his whole life, but his English is awesome with an Australian accent on the side! Even though it was my first time meeting Bedu, he treated me like I was a long lost friend and he was a pleasant people person! Mr. Bedu was easy to a get a hold of, his response time was very quick, and he was very punctual (or maybe its better to say he's early). Spending a whole day with him goes by very quickly. He knows a lot about Bali , so you just give him your itinerary and he'll make it happen. If you don't know what you want to do, just give him a gist and he'll take you to the best spots in Bali. I was traveling to multiple countries so the original dates I reserved with Mr.Bedu did not work out. He was very flexible with the changes I made; and even though some of the dates didn't work out anymore, he set me up with a reliable friend who was also a driver. During the time his friend drove us, he would call his friend to make sure we were getting the best experience. While communicating with him back in the states, we planned our itinerary together, because it was my first time in Bali. He helped me to group all my activities to see which activities would make the most sense and to maximize my time in Indonesia. He arranged for transport when necessary, he drove us to all the spots we wanted to see (even between transport, he would point out spots to see for a quick look). We did the whole Ubud main spots, and then we did another day of visiting beautiful beaches, he set us up with a beachfront seafood restaurant for sunset where you can ride horses. Lastly, I wanted to cross over to Gili Islands, and he made it possible in the last minute with the shuttle bus back to my hotel and everything! There were many people being turned away despite having purchased tickets from third parties, which makes me believe that he is a reliable source. Side note: Even with third party companies out of his control it seemed like he took the extra step to talk to the right people and make sure I knew what to check/look out for to ensure that we had a good experience with that company or even street vendors! When I return to Bali, I am definitely booking through Bedu Tours again!"

Firstly, he provided four of us with the smoothest airport transfer we've ever experienced in his comfortable and spacious ride. Secondly, he took us on a day trip from Seminyak to Ubud to explore the jungle. This was definitely one of, if not THE highlight of our entire trip. We let him know the vibe we were after and he meticulously planned an amazing day of adventure and fun. I cannot recommend him highly enough!"

Mr Bedu spoke excellent English and was more than happy to talk us through the cultural meanings of the sights and Balinese life. Mr Bedu was a fun guide who loved to chat and have a laugh with us. He took great shots of us and also gave us some time at each place to explore by ourselves. We had a delicious lunch with a stunning view which mr Bedu recommended us. Thanks for a very fun day, Mr Bedu!"

He picked us up from our hotel, and took us to see a volcano, to the rice fields, on a coffee tour and then to a beautiful temple which he then walked us around explaining the religion. He was extremely nice, and very helpful. I'd recommend his private tours completely as you get the luxury of being driven around in a nice car with a genuine guy who can enlighten you with all the information you need. Im actually coming back to Bali in September and will be using Mr Bedu's services again."

He is a wonderful man, and he will become a friend for life, as he has for us.Whenever I return to Bali again, I will always hire Komamg Bedu, as it will be great to see my old friend again and I know he will take good care of me. He has my highest recommendations. You will be very happy if you hire him, as spending time with him will make your vacation even more enjoyable, relaxing and special."

Bedu being a local also ensures you don't get ripped off.. we did a rafting tour and he managed to save us over 50% off the price at the counter.

Our tour took the whole day. And we wished it wasn't over, because there's just so much to see and do. There were five girls in my group. We went to Bali for my friend's 40th birthday celebration. Imagine this...you got five girls, who think they're models....in other words, we're crazy about having pictures taken of ourselves. No one wants to be the photographer. And we love dance music. Last but not least, we love to shop. Our tour guide was a young man named Gus Dudik. He came to pick us up in Legian. He arrived on time, but us being girls always running late. I believe it was an hour drive to all the sites we wanted to see. And Gus was perfect for our group. He had all the music we liked to listen to, while other drivers had no music. It makes our day and drive more fun. Gus was our wonderful photographer. He was so patient with us American girls. Each of us were grabbing him, and pulling him aside to take pictures, because he just knew how to get a good picture. Some tour guide or driver would just stay in the van after they get you to the destination, but Gus would come along with us. He was like a friend to us already. We felt so comfortable with Gus that we wanted him to eat with us when he took us to the restaurant at one of our stop for food. We even treated him and gave him tips. He deserved it, because it takes a lot of patience to deal with us girls. I highly recommend Gus as your tour guide. We had so much fun at the temple, the waterfall, and the rice fields. He gives you great advice on where to eat and when to shop for souvenirs. I hope you will enjoy your trip just as we did. Thank you Bali Sun Tours for the fun and adventures!"

Note: M, 20 and duo travelling with friend.I booked this with my friend a day before, 8:30am start and the driver and tour guide (Gusti) was an amazing host with great English and was extremely helpful and fun the whole trip. We started the drive to Ubud, the art district of Bali where we saw (and bought) souvenirs but also how cloth is made for so many products and how amazing it may look (Cheers to Gusti for letting us wonder and browse for over an hour!). After that we went to the jewellery and painting. Even by the side of the road were so many amazing sculptures. The second part was the Temple was just a sight to see and Gusti had amazing local knowledge about it. Then the waterfall which was awesome. 165 steps down and 165 steps back up made for good exercise. The way down was fun and the waterfalls water was cooling. Finally the rice field was the depiction of the tour: Green. It was amazing to see and the food that came with it was strangely delicious.Overall: When visiting again with friends and/or family, I'll be sure to book these guys (and hopefully Gusti cause he's an awesome mate) to tour with!"

Already on the drive there Juli proved to be a great guide and answered all our questions, also telling us about his family and how they live balinese culture. We learned a lot about the culture and daily life in Bali. THANK YOU JULI!The monkey forrest was great and we enjoyed feeding bananas to the monkeys. Definately a place to enjoy for young and old \"kids\".As we asked to be driven to the Ubud arts villages Juni took us to see paintings, silver wood and batic crafts centers. Ok, if you like to buy stuff you might be right here,...The quad bike ride got the adrenaline pumping! If you want a scenic ride: Forget It! In this ride you go off road where the water filled track is often only as wide as the ATV itself. Going up and down the surprisingly hilly path is fun but sometimes even a little scary. Lots of fun and you definitely get wet and dirty (or was there only this much water because it rained the same day?)Then some more talking in the car and we were back at the hotel about 9 hours later."

Both were very friendly and helpful. The stops were good value for money and the companies doing the adventure tours were professional. I recommend you have some quad biking experience before taking on Bali tracks though. Food provided was good and tasty (we did not expect 5 star cuisine). We saw plenty of temples and the company was also very flexible on changing some of the stops on the day. Tanah Lot and the Holy water temples were some of the best temples to view.All and all a very good experience. This was our first experience of Bali. Bali Sun Tours also accommodated us the night before making bookings at 10pm the previous day for quad biking and river rafting.Quotes matched the prices."

He spoke excellent English and done everything to make sure we enjoyed our day allowing us to stay as long as we wanted in each place and where we went, as well as providing us with loads of information about the areas and culture. The rice terrace and waterfall were beautiful. We ended up using Made throughout our whole stay in Bali for various transfers and booking our boats to gili islands. He really done everything to make sure we were happy and comfortable (stop at shops for drinks, answer any questions etc). Great tour company with excellent tour guides.

He didn't just drive us around, he actually went to the sites with us and genuinely wanted to get to know us. By the end of the tour, it felt like friends visiting all the sites. Great value for everything you get to see, the highlights were Ulun Danu, Jatiluwih Rice Terrace (way better than Tegallalang) and GitGit Waterfall. It was a long drive to reach the destinations (as everywhere in Bali) but the journey was just as beautiful as the sights. Highly recommend booking a tour with Made Aldo!!!"

He spoke excellent English and went out of his way to ensure we saw what we were interested in seeing (as we did not have a lot of time available to us). His driving was excellent :-) He took photos for us which we really appreciated and it was terrific to have photos of both of us in the same photo for a change. We would highly recommend Made as a fantastic tour guide and Bali Sun Tours as a reputable tour company. Made showed us a wide variety of experiences in Bali and we have decided that we will return to Bali for a holiday and explore more that the island has to offer."

We booked the one day tour to Tanah Lot through Viator and were very much looking forward to our trip as it was highly recommended through trip advisor. After doing the tour I really can't understand all the positive feedback! We got picked up by Yoga around 8 in the morning (he even was a little early).As we read in the reviews before the people said it was possible to slightly change the programme. But when we asked him to skip the art villages and instead go to Tirta Empul he looked shocked at us and said that it's not possible because it's not in the Ubud area (we later checked this and it's not true). This was OK for us so we made the tour as it was. First we got to the Tegalalong rice terrasses but unless the other guides we saw around, Yoga didn't want to come with us so we had to find the way through the terrasses by ourselves which didn't work out that good. He also nearly gave us no explanation. Next stop was a coffee plantation. Yoga just handed us over to a lady who \"explained\" us as short and fast as possible the coffee making process and sat next to us the whole time during the tasting trying to sell us there products. You nearly felt forced to buy something. We didn't buy anything and when we came back to the car Yoga directly asked us if we didn't like it because we didn't buy...The stops in the \"art villages\" which are only shops were all similar:Yoga hands you over to someone and the give you one sentence of explanation(like you can pay with credit card or cash) and then chase you through the whole shop trying to sell something. Originally we should stop at 4 art villages. Yoga shortened the programme to 3 villages without asking us. Well we didn't say anything because the chance was high that we get no explanation and only get forced to buy something. Final stop around noon was the Tanah Lot temple. According to the time schedule described we should have reached it got sunset but Yoga already told us in the beginning that the tour is never that long. The temple itself was not very spectacular but OK and again we got no explanation at all. All in all I don't recommend this tour as they just try to make money and you barely get any information. Instead of doing this tour better get to the temple yourself (it might be cheaper) or do the Batur volcano tour organised by Dek Bud which was a highlight of our stay in Bali."

We booked all of our tours (with the exception of one & boy did we regret not also booking that one with Bali Sun Tours) with this company prior to leaving Australia to come to Bali and frankly, I was a little nervous. Once we arrived and our first tour kicked off on day 2 of our trip, all of my concerns evaporated. Our driver (named Made Les) took excellent care of us and explained so much to us about local customs, traffic conditions, pricing for goods and so much more. We did one other tour with another company and it was incredible re lack of quality compared to the expert service and consistent, quality service via email, phone and through our driver with Bali Sun Tours. I recommend this company to all Australians visiting Bali who want the gold standard of tours. Worth every cent (and still very cheap) as these drivers work hard to make sure your tour is above average in every aspect (and you are not ripped off). My tip is to ask for our driver named Made and always make sure that you tip your driver a decent amount (we have 100,000 Rp per tour) as the quality and good karma you receive back is bountiful. We will only use Bali Sun Tours for our trips to Bali. Highly recommended to all."

My husband, three kids (aged 13,9 & 7) loved every moment of our adventure. It was the highlight of our Bali trip!Communication with this company prior to our water rafting was fantastic.The rafting itself was fun and perfect for beginners. We felt safe at all times.There were many times that we felt like we were in a scene from Jarassic World or Indiana Jones movie. Truly amazing!Our guide was very professional and great with the kids.Lunch following the rafting was also delicious.FYI - It is a steep walk down and up from the river. Approx 400 steps each way. Hard to complain though, when we watched women carrying our 50kg raft on their heads up the 400 steps.Tip: I would highly recommend bringing money to give to the women and men carrying our rafts back for us"

The Luminous Green Tour was spent with our lovely driver Tude exploring the Ubud region including fine arts of Batik, silver smithing, painting and wood carving. We visited Teganungan Waterfall, Batuan Temple, the Ubud Rice Terraces and last but not least the Coffee and Tea plantation where we tried a large variety of tea and coffee blends including the famous Luwak coffee. Today we went on the Romantic tour accompanied by our awesome driver Made Astama. Made is a young fun guy and we liked him playing music in the car - made the long drives in between places less awkward! First stop was Nusa Dua for tandem Parasailing - very exciting, then on to the amazing Padang Padang beach for an ice cold Bintang, a swim and sunbake...beautiful spot. Then on to Uluwatu Temple, absolutely stunning views and we even saw some monkeys. We finished off the day at Jimbaran Bay to have a seafood dinner and watch the sunset over the ocean. A perfect day."

            "review": "Not sure what all the fuss is about?. I chose to book a sunrise trek on Mt Batur with Bali Sun Tours because the Groupon seemed like good value, and (unusually) we were organising a fair bit of our holiday in advance from Australia. Normally we just book things on the fly, but I was curious to see the difference it would make using a very highly rated company like Bali Sun Tours. The reviews of the company are outstanding, so from curiosity more than anything, we thought we would test it out. How much better could they be than all the other companies we knew you could use to book a sunrise trek? (This was not our first time in Bali, and when you arrive in Ubud almost every third shopfront is selling tickets on sunrise volcano treks and river rafting trips so its very easy to organise something when you get there).First of all, forget all romantic notions you have about climbing a volcano for sunrise! This is a HUGELY popular thing to do, and despite it being quite a difficult climb (vertical tracks up loose, rocky & sandy paths under torchlight in the dark) there might literally be 2000 other people doing it with you.Now this is not the fault of Bali Sun Tours, but when the full price of your tour is AUD$150 each you might expect a comprehensively guided trip - information about the geology, the environment, the volcano's history...You get absolutely nothing along these lines! As far as I can tell, Bali Sun Tours employ very nice drivers, with uniforms and modern cars with good air conditioning and heating - but we were told to be ready at our homestay for pickup between 2am - 2:15am...and at 2:45am there was still no sign of our driver. The car turned up at 2:50am (so we had been standing on the street in the dark waiting for 50 minutes) with a humble apology that we were made to wait, because he had to pick up other trekkers. Ok fine, but clearly there is a communication breakdown somewhere!Once we arrived at the starting point of the trek, we were introduced to our \"guide\" and I feel bad putting that in inverted commas, but honestly he was just an escort. Speaking very little English, he was a young, shy local guy who was more interested in hanging out with his guide mates (and I don't blame him, as a young shy kid being put in charge of random foreigners where communication is strained). The promised \"volcanic egg breakfast\" is a bit of a joke - I wasn't even sure were were going to get anything to eat because our guide didn't communicate with us what was going on once we reached the top. Eventually boiled eggs, hot bananas and white bread were delivered to us but they came out of a hut (and I'm pretty sure out of a saucepan on a gas cooker) - not out of the earth. Our guide forgot to offer us tea and coffee until sunrise was over and we were ready to leave - he was just doing his best, but I feel he could use some more guidance himself on how to be a good guide.I spotted other trekkers with much fancier breakfasts, and very engaged guides answering lots of questions - so all this made me wonder - what is all the fuss about Bali Sun Tours, when I'm pretty sure you could get exactly the same experience booking a trek through a company off the street and probably for less than we paid even with the Groupon discount?Overall I was disappointed, and would recommend lowering your expectations for the whole experience, as it is a very crowded, popular, touristy tour to do.But to finish on a positive, at the end of the day we had climbed a volcano and seen the sun rise, and eaten a hot banana sandwich at the summit, which you don't do every day..."

He is of great character and feels more like family than our tour guide.

Putu was happy to spend more or less time at places as we wished. At one point we stopped as we passed something of interest, Putu was keen to allow us this freedom. We were recommended this company by a friend and we would certainly recommend them to others."

We decided to skip the tour packages offered at the airport and instead make a more informed decision by doing research on trip advisor and utilizing brochures we picked up. Bali Sun Tours received great reviews and because there were specific places we wanted to see, we booked a driver for 10 hours in hopes of going to places we had our hearts set on. The booking process was extremely simple. I sent them an email stating what I wanted and an agent answered quickly to set up the payment and instructions on where and when the driver would meet us. The next day Putu came to pick us up in the lobby of our hotel at The Mulia. He was excited and enthusiastic about the day ahead. We told him all the places we wanted to see and he also included suggestions of other destinations we might enjoy. Putu was full of knowledge because we had a million questions we wanted to know about Bali, the people, the culture, and the language. We got to see the monkeys in Ubud, rice terraces, and Gunung Kawi temple. At all of these places Putu knew the perfect spots to get the best pictures from. The next stop was a suggestion from Putu to Manik Abian Bali Agriculture. We weren't too enthusiastic about coffee and tea tasting but thought we would give it a try. We are so glad we did! We got to try cinnamon right off the trees, coffee bean plants, cacao, everything was just sensory overload. Then when we arrived at the area where we would have our tea and coffee tasting, we are amazed by the spectacular view. It was set high above what looked like a jungle, so peaceful and serene. We would have missed this experience if it weren't for Putu. Honestly, anything we were interested in, whether it was a specific type of cuisine or massage place, Putu had a suggestion. He took us to this delicious Thai place where the locals eat and a beautiful spa where we had a Balinese massage. We even told him we wanted to go and get fried bananas from a street vendor. He took us to a place and got out and ensured it was freshly made and ordered for us. The best part is that during our drive to each destination Putu taught us so many phrases that we could use during our stay. We learned \"how are you\", \"good morning\", \"thank you\" and so much more!!! I cannot express how thankful and blessed we are to have had such an amazing experience in Bali, and it was all because of Putu. We are already planning a trip back because there is still so much to see and the hospitality is probably the best we have ever experienced in the world. Thank you Bali Sun Tours and especially Putu, for making our adventures around Bali unforgettably wonderful. See you next year!"

Took us out to the beach and then onto the boat. During this time I started to panic a bit! The guys on the pontoon were amazing. One of the divers took to the side and calmed me down, and reassured me. So glad he did because it was amazing down there. I thoroughly recommend it. We paid for a camera (cost around $30) and so glad we did, the photos were awesome. Such an amazing experience. And I wouldn't have gone down if the divers weren't so reassuring and professional."

We were given his information from our friends who visit Bali often and do day trips with Nyoman. We have just finished our Third trip with him today and it was amazing just like the other days. The first trip we did was the Ubud tour where we visited a few sights such as a cool waterfall, rice fields, monkey forrest and a coffee plantation. Since we enjoyed this so much we then proceeded to book the volcano trek with Nyoman, once again this was a great experience and our volcano guide (Made)was great... He seemed to be the most fun guide we came across during the trek! Today we visited the temple on the lake, the twin lakes, another monkey forrest and tanah lot... Again it was a fun day. These trips have allowed us to visit the 'real bali' away from all the commercial beach resorts... Id highly recommend giving these trips a go. We've also had great help from Nyoman in sorting some logistics out for us such as our ferry and transfers to Gilli T and also our airport transfers! Keep up the good work Dr Bali!!"

After seeing excellent reviews about Bali Sun Tours we chose them to assist us in seeing all that Bali has to offer.In those 7 days we did about 7 planned tours Bali Sun Tours has to offer (below) plus we were also able to customise our own itinerary using the private driver services and we had the same driver- Made for the whole trip including Airport Transfers.Our Private driver Made, he was an excellent host, always made us fee comfortable and was very patient with us even when we wanted to stop for food/ bathroom etc His English was excellent, and was always able to answer questions we had about Balinese culture and traditions. He also helped us communicating with locals and making sure we weren't paying too much when bartering. The car we traveled was very comfortable and clean with air conditioning and a cooler/esky in the back where we could put our drinks to have ice cold. Using Bali Sun Tours took the stress away from us for airport and hotel transfers. It made our holiday more enjoyable not having to worry about how to get around. We made great friends with Made and we recommend Bali Sun Tours to our friends wanting to visit Bali. These are the services we used from Bali Sun Tours. Safe to say our review is credible with the amount of tours we did with them;-Eat Pray Tour-Bright Bali Tour-Elephant Ride Tour-Bali 3 Island Cruise-Sunset Dinner Cruise-Sunset Dinner -Fast Boat to Gili Islands. Thank you to Agung & Made once again for making our Bali experience wonderful."

If we wanted to leave, we left, wanted to sit under a tree, he sat with us and waited. Fantastic. He also took us to the most amazing little 'local knowledge' hole in the wall Warung, where we were served delicious pork, rice and vegetables, which cost around $4.00AUD per plate - You can't beat that. Highly recommend booking Oka for your next day tour! I sure as hell will be when I return to bali."

The day was great, made drove us to the destinations and gave a great insight into each one before letting us head off and explore by ourselves. Following this we used Bali Sun Tours to arrange our rafting, we combined this with private driver service as we wanted to go to Seminyak after. Rafting was great, safe well organised and absolutely beautiful to travel down the ayung river experiencing the rapids.On our way to Seminyak, Made was explaining the other parts of the Island that we hadn't seen. We were really interested in seeing Nusa Dua and Uluwatu, we arranged to meet Made again for a tour of this area which was great, we did watersports, went to padang padang beach which was beautiful then to Uluwatu temple where Made shown us around and taught us about the hindu religion, we saw the beautiful cliff top views before we watched the Kecack fire dance.

As well as this, I found Bali Sun Tours very easy to communicate with via email whilst I was still in Australia. I booked a couple of months in advance on a Groupon, and Padmi was so quick and helpful that I decided to book a few more tours with them.

I was somewhat sceptical of what we would get given the price we paid, however we were pleasantly surprised. We were picked up from our hotel at 08:30 by Jule our guide/driver for the day. The day was fantastic with Jule's company being the highlight of our tour. He was on time for our pick up, professional, knowledgeable, skilful at navigating the terrible Bali traffic, funny and accommodating to all our needs.We were firstly taken the the Tegallalang Rice Terrace, followed by a tasting of Luwak coffee, then on to The Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Ubud, with some art shops (painting/wood carving/jewellery & batik) to end the day. Whilst the shopping at the end was not my favourite element, it was still interesting and all parties were kind and respectful with us just looking and not buying.Our day finished at about 1700 dropped back at our hotel. We both really enjoyed the tour and the company of Jule throughout the day. I would definitely book another tour with Bali Sun Tours on our next trip to Bali."

More specifically by our extremely friendly and helpful driver, Aldo Made. He took us to places such as jimbaran bay, ayung river for water rafting and ubud for ATV riding. He's always punctual, and never fails to give me great suggestions and recommendations. I'm lucky to have met him the very first time I travelled to Bali."

This was an extremely disappointing, not to mention the lack of safety, firstly no life jackets on boat to get you to main station, then no one to help you get on boat and one man slipped getting in boat and injured himself and could not do the ocean walk. Then once on main station, our boat driver crashed into the boat, no one could speak English and the instructions were not explained. However once in water the guys were very good. On the way back the boat had engine troubles and when back to shore, we were advised the reason for problems on boat was because it was his first day. The only saving grace for us was one of the girls on the tour could speak the local language and thus translated everything on our behalf. Very, very, disappointing trip and unsafe!!!!!!!"

We had a great day and our driver Lila was a really fun guy, who told us lots about the area, and his own life and experiences living in Bali. He also changed our tour around slightly to fit our requests and skip places we were less interested in seeing.The rice fields at Tegalalang were amazing, lush and green at the time we visited, and well worth stopping and the photo opp. We also really enjoyed seeing the artwork in the art villages and while closely accompanied through each shop, we didn't feel pressured to buy something and could spend time appreciating the different styles of art and skills that went into each piece. To be honest, we would be unlikely do this as part of a tour again though, and would research our own shops etc if we were interested in purchasing something and visit them separately. The paintings and wood carvings were really impressive and we were able to ask lots of questions; however, the silver/gold and batik may mostly be of interest to you if you are looking to make a purchase as they are really just large stores (less emphasis on how the pieces are made) but they do have some beautiful fabrics/ jewellery.  The Tegenungan waterfall was also very nice to visit. Quite busy compared to those in the Northern waterfalls we saw but we like waterfalls so enjoyed it. Didn't swim as was really rocky, and to be honest the water looked an unappealing colour but that didn't bother most people there. Also, it seemed pretty well maintained and kept free largely of rubbish which is always good to see in Bali :)Overall, a fun day, glad we booked through Bali Sun Tours, might have been a little more expensive than some day driver rates we had elsewhere but for us it was really worth it to get a driver who was very friendly, local, with great english and knowledge of the areas, and a nice comfortable/clean car for the day!"

On this occasion we did the Sunset Bali Tour which went to Uluwatu Temple which is huge and definitely need some time to walk around & take in the magnificent views of the cliffs & sunset. At the temple we also watched the Kecak Fire Dance this started at 6pm and finished around 7pm, get there early to get a good front seat as it gets very busy.After the fire dance we were driven back to Jimbaran Bay where we went to a seafood restaurant for a nice seafood dinner, you select the seafood you want fresh from the tanks and get it cooked how you like & enjoy eating while watching the waves roll in.A great tour & highly recommend it, our guide Yoga was great, spoke very good English & provided great information about everything."

Had 2 young drivers on the 17/5/16 (can't remember names) but they were extremely friendly, well spoken and cheerful lads. Offered local advice for places to eat and drink and an insight into the Balinese lifestyle and culture. We did a tour to Ubud monkey forest, art markets, coffee tour (Kopi lewak) and rice fields. They also accommodated an extra stop for us to go and get a massage and lunch from a spa in the area. Unfortunately we didn't get to see the rice fields as it was 330pm by the time we finished our massage. The drivers were still happy to take us for no extra fee even though we'd gone well-over our \"half day\" tour. The monkey tour is a must and great fun for the whole family. You can buy bananas in the forest and have monkeys sit on your head for photos. Just ask one of the monkey forest staff. Art tour isn't my cup of tea and can probably be skipped for something else. Kopi lewak coffee making tour is great!! You walk through a local farm and the coffee making process from plant to cup is explained. You get a free sample of about 15 different kinds of teas made locally, some delicious, some not. Coffee is Rp$50000 per cup but well worth every penny."

Basically we planned our itinerary based on what was recommended in TripAdvisor, and we just handed over to Wayun to drive us to the places we want to visit for 3 of the days. Wayun is a really friendly and professional driver. Not only was he always on time to pick us up everyday, he was also very familiar with his directions. Wayun even took the initiative to change into a bigger car on our third day knowing that some of us have quite a bit of things to carry and thus might possibly compromise our leg space. We were really appreciative of the many small gestures he had done for us, and it was undoubtedly that the service he provided was excellent.Over the 3 days, we visited Tanah Lot Temple, Pasar Seni Ubud, Tegallalang Rice Terraces, Mount Batur, Tegenungan Waterfall, Rock Bar, Potato Head Beach Club, Jimbaran Beach and did river rafting on the Ayung River. We also had meals over at Bebek Joni, Naughty Nuri's and Habitual Quench & Feed. It was a pity that we could not visit the Uluwatu Temple on our last day due to the poor traffic conditions and we had a flight to catch, but Wayun was quick to suggest other places whenever we needed alternatives. Traffic in Bali can be pretty bad at times, but Wayun was always patient and positive, which made us feel very comfortable being around him.Definitely would recommend the places that we visited, but even more so for our driver Wayun. Visiting the places aforementioned would only be possible if there is a driver to take you around for the day, and of course having an excellent service provided by Wayun certainly enhanced the overall travelling experience in Bali.Do look for Wayun if you plan on visiting Bali and need a driver! PM me if you need his contact."

Be sure to bargain for a cheaper price especially if buying two tours. White water rafting facilities were Pretty basic and run down faculties by the river. But the boat instructor was brilliant! It was a nice small group just the 4 of us, unlike other tours which seemed to have about 30 people in many boats. It was a 2hour drive from legian, and the drive was uncomfortable and tiring. The lunch at the end of the river was traditional Indonesian food. The Mt Batur Volcano tour was VERY EARLY 2am pickup, arrived at the bottom at about 4am. There were only the two of us in our group and the instructor. He was very helpful and held my hand in the difficult areas of the climb and decent so I didn't fall. If you're fit, this climb will be fine. There were a few hundred people climbing at the same time, sometimes other groups were slow and the path was too narrow to overtake. The brochure says wear long pants, we wore shorts and got pretty hot & sweaty. But At 5:15 when we got to our spot for the sunrise, we got quite cold. I recommend shorts but pack a small blanket or jumper! Also bring a spare shirt! Our bus driver Dedik was awesome. After the volcano we went to Lewak Coffee which was awesome! Loved it! Then Dedik took us to the rice fields and To the Bebek restaurant in Ubud. Since there was only two of us (my husband and I) in the bus, it was like having a personal tour. Thank you Bali sun tours!"

He even rang the owner of our villa to make sure of the directions so he knew exactly where to go.

We learnt so much from him and he helped us to fall in love with Bali! (Which wasn't hard!) our day trip around Ubud was really good fun and he even brought us to a restaurant that was off the tourist trail so we had an amazing Indonesian meal looking our over the rice terraces with no other tourists around- this was really special. The tour was very reasonably priced. When we come back to Bali we will definitely be ringing Nyoman again and arranging all of our transport and tours with him and Bali Sun Tours.

On the day, the first pick-up was over one hour late, one of the parties stayed at Vlad Bali Villa which was located in a complex that was out of sight (no signage, directions etc) so this was partly our fault. Communication during pick-up however, lacked efficiency and the fact we speak indo didn't help, quite frustrating. When we did get picked-up, the driver was extremely apologetic and was kind & courteous. The ATV was a little disappointing, the vehicles were old and poorly maintained, the facilities were quite poor (broken lockers and mediocre lunch) the guide's ATV broke down so he had to ride with me, and one of ours kept stalling, but it was quite fun. The whitewater rafting was AWESOME, the company used by Bali Sun Tours had a great facility, the staff was very friendly and the rafting was heaps of fun, absolutely loved it. Bali Sun Tour, please change the ATV company."

We bought a Groupon voucher for a tubing adventure and it was the best thing we ever did!We went in separate doughnut boats and had to got through a few tough rafts in the river (be aware if you go single it is a little bit tough and you need a lot of upper body strength! Not for the faint hearted) the rainforest was AMAZING and we ended the tour with coffee tasting (vanilla and chocolate were my favourites!!)We loved the rafting so much we did an ATV ride (also in Ubud) the terrain was muddy and gritty but it's exactly what we wanted! We had Dodik for our driver and he was so friendly and young and up for a chat! We laughed the whole ride there and back and he would tell us what we were passing and answer all of our questions. So informative and fun!The next day we wanted to go to Uluwatu Temple, and we requested Dodik again but he was not available so we got his Uncle, Komang Suant. He was Brilliant! Had cold water and towels every time we came back to the car after being in the sun. He explained everything and had amazing stories to tell us! Great English and could understand us as well (most of the time) it was our best day yet! We thanked him by taking him to a restaurant of his choice and he didn't disappoint!Sun tours is definitely a great company to go with for all your Bali activities!!"

Then we were off around Ubud chatting the whole time. Did the Atv ride and then back for a yummy lunch. After lunch Made Aldo took us back to our hotel again chatting the whole way back. Felt so comfortable with him and he was a great driver (considering the mayhem of bali streets/traffic). Today we were suppose to go water rafting but my husband woke up sick as a dog called bali sun tours to reschedule and there was no problem at all! That is great service! So glad we chose bali sun tours - highly recommend them!!! Can't wait to go water rafting with them in a few days. \u263a"

Lunch was simple but good, nasi gorang, mie gorang or chicken burger & soft drink.The driver we has for the day - \"Nyomen\" was very friendly and spoke great English and explained a lot of sights on the way.

He picked us up exactly at the designated pick up time and not a moment later, which was great as we are used to other tour companies picking us up late. The tour included seeing woodcalving, silver jewellery making, going to a coffee plantation, walking through rice terraces in Ubud, experiencing 2 temples and the lunch spot Oka chose for us was great.

We asked to change the date of one of our bookings and it was so easy to do with them. Unbeknown to us we had booked a day trip to Ubud on the day of a big ceremony that was a few days prior to Nyepi Day & roads were to be closed. This would cause chaos for us and our driver so they again re-arranged my bookings to fit in with this. When we finally got our day trip our driver Putu was just awesome! Polite, funny and always happy to fit in with us and our requests. Putu lives in a small village near Ubud so he knew all the back roads to avoid tourist traffic. He even took us down through his village. I would highly recommend Bali Sun to anybody. We've already booked one tour with them for our October visit and will most certainly be booking another (when the voucher dates are extended on Groupon) Putu was an absolute pleasure to have as our guide and we will specifically ask for him again. Thanks Bali Sun & thanks PutuAndrea & Steve"

After purchasing a Groupon deal $90 (which was a bit cheaper then the online price) for two for white water rafting i emailed BST for a booking and padmi responded immediately! So efficient in answering all my queries and confirming all the details. We were located in nusa dua so our pickup time was at 8.30 am and we arrived at anout 9.45- So just over an hour. Our driver was de wa who was quite friendly. English is obviously not the first language but we were able to communicate w him just fine. And we were the only couple so it was a great! If only the aircon worked better.. Better then nothing i guess? A step up- prob offer wAter, mint and free wifi?Got to the rafting venue and we were handed over to marty our guide. A funny and happy guide who was able to speak english quite well. Just a few years older then my husband so they got on really well - shared a few smokes and a beer too.. Met 4 other travellers and promptly got all our gear, ready to start! The walk down to the start of the rafting is about 400 steps.. Approx 10min walk.. Steps are quite steep! The rafting was amazing! We were at the front so we faced all the adventure front on! Its ok to wear thongs thats what we did and it was perfectly fine. Remember to hold onto the rope when theres rocks!! A few of the other travellers fell off the seat a few times.. Hehe.. Whole trip was over 2 hrs and it was good that they gave us a break at about halfway. Prior warming the 300 steps back up is hard! Different route - stairs are not as steep but phew.. After 2hrs of rafting, hungry, high humidity and whilst very hot - the 300steps was a challenge! Take your time.. And work those sweat!!Back to the rental venue and a lunch buffet was provided. Only let down was the meal - bland rice and noodle and curry chicken w veggies and fruits as dessert.. You have to buy your drinks as well.. No water provided.Changing room was fairly clean. Towels and shower/change room provided.So overall a great experience! Im feeling sore now.. :("

Both my partner and I found it fun and exciting! All the activities met our expectations. ATVing was thrilling! Lots of energy and getting dirty in the mud too! And the volcano hike was spectacular. The hike was physical but worth it when you get to the top. Our driver Made was amazing. After taking us on our first tour we ended up using him to book more tours and just used him as our driver in Bali! He was very informative, friendly, and easy going - best driver you can get! I would highly recommend using him as your driver for he provides the best rates and can take you to the best places. He even helped out when my boyfriend got sick and had to go to the hospital!Bali sun tour was super easy to work with. Easy to book, great communication, and they always rock up on time. If you do book through them, see if you can get Made to be your driver"

We had the same tour guide to drive us to and from every activity everyday. Aldo Made was so welcoming and friendly. He went above and beyond what I ever expected from a driver. He lent my cousin his very own shoes to protect him from the water and even gave us his shirt to dry ourselves with. We all got along so well that I am very happy to call him a friend."

We were taken to Tirta Empul Temple to visit the iconic holy spring water temple but not before stopping first to take some quick happy snaps of the rice terraces near Tegalalang along the way. Oka has taken us to visit one of the coffee and spice plantations where they offered us free samples of coffee and teas. For all coffee lovers, this is the one place you will need to visit during your stay in Bali. Awesome aromatic flavours that would sure to give your taste buds a treat. Try the premium Luwak coffee or easily known as \"Cat-poo-chino\" made by the post part-digestive processing from the Asian palm civet.Towards the end of the day, Oka has drove us back to Ubud to visit Ubud Palace and the markets until finishing the day at a restaurant of his recommendations for a delicious suckling pig special. A tasty dish!We highly recommend Oka and Bali Sun Tours. We only wished that our stay in Bali was longer."

However our guide name Made made out our trip a memorable and at the end we hired him as a our private tour guide again on our last trip day. We had an awesome time on a day tour with Made to Ubud area (beautiful rice fields, ubud monkey forest, a coffee luwak plantation, Ubud art villages and a Ubud market)Actually, Ubud market tour wasn't in the program however, Made (the tour guide) generously negotiate the program and letting us to tour Ubud area. Made took us to Uluwatu temple, Kuta are shopping centre (Discovery mall) and Spa on our last day. We found that the massage price is a bit expensive than other places, we could have done a deal with the massage shop people but we didn't want to ruin our last day we paid what they offered.Car was clean and super cool. If anyone concern what to do with your luggage don't worry they will keep an eyes on your luggage. We carried all our luggage for our last day trip before going to airport, we didn't have any trouble with that.Made speaks English very well and friendly. Very polite, patient and knowledgeable. I will definitely recommend to all our friends.We are very satisfy of what they provided to us."

White water raftingThe ATV tour was very good, thrilling and exciting especially for first timers. You get to ride through several villages, on the open road, and also through rice terraces. Make sure to apply insect repellent though!The Let's Get Wet tour included parasailing, rolling donut, banana boat and jet ski - great fun for people who want a taste of what each of these are, you only get one round of each activity so it doesn't actually last very long but great fun. If you do this, remember to add on the Seawalker (albeit expensive) which takes you about 5-6m underwater under a helmet without the hassle of dive equipment. You can feed the fish and touch coral and it was truly amazing.White water rafting is at Ayung river, and it is quite an easy, breezy cruise down the river. There are rapids, but not the kinds you see in movies of course. So for all those afraid of falling into the water and stuff, don't worry, this tour is amazing. For all those who want more adventure, I'd suggest looking to do an alternative rafting tour at a different river.Last but not least, the ubud chocolate making and arts tour. This was highly disappointing and a huge letdown. It took us over an hour to get to the chocolate factory, the staff did not entertain us or acknowledge our presence and even after asking twice nicely to take us around to go through the process of chocolate making, they refused to bring us around and \"pretended\" they didn't speak English, or maybe the general staff's English is really poor. The only thing we got to do upon arrival is make some chocolate which was basically piping melted chocolate into moulds and topping it with whatever ingredient you chose. They somehow managed to give my partner's bag of chocolate to someone else and didn't bother notifying us until we asked them where our chocolates were as we realised we had been sitting around for 1.5-2 hours doing nothing. They didn't apologise for their mistake, and said we could make another batch of chocolates but would have to wait an extra 30-45min. We politely declined. The rest of the tour was just driving around to the different villages to see silver jewellery, stone carvings, wood carvings and paintings. I appreciate culture but going to those places was not worth it as they don't really show you how they've come to achieve the final product but just follow you around hassling you to buy products instead. The only up-side to this tour was we got to watch the elephants play and bathe and the sun bears enjoying the sunshine and eating whilst we were at the chocolate factory. padmi (tour booking manager) is really helpful, polite and responds promptly which made booking the tours and reconfirmations a breeze.all the drivers were awesome and friendly, good drivers as well (for those of you who know traffic in bali) and always early/on time.there are heaps of other tours offered, so make sure to check out their website. i'd highly recommend this company, just maybe skip out on the arts tours."

The driver (aldo) was on time and so friendly with in minutes we felt like old mates and he started his tour with us a few things listed didn't really interest us so we skipped a few and did different things he was happy to accommodate us we started with the agung. Dance which was amazing to see .We then headed to a coffee farm which was absolutely fantastic aldo came through the tour with us and he was very funny and informative of the area. Following that we were off to monkey forest , the whole time aldo explaining places as we passed through and spoke often about traditions and culture . Monkey forest was amazing to see , all monkeys running free be careful of the monkeys as not all are friendly don't let monkeys see water bottle or bananas keep those thing well hidden :) and you will enjoy your day as we did . We then Went to a beautiful place for lunch I can't recall the name but it was very nice and the food was lovely .. Aldo was happy to stop along the way back to our hotel as I wanted to purchase some items for my Bali hut at home he helped me negotiate price and assisted due to the language barrier in the village I was so happy with my purchase it made my day .. I am looking forward to heading back to Bali in the coming months and will definitely booking another tour through Bali sun tours I thank them very much for a wonderful experience I would highly recommend this tour group to anyone :)"

He's one of the best driver you can find in Bali, from personal point, friendly, helpful, interactive, patient, a great smile and even take picture for us. I would strongly recommend him. Although theirs a lot of rip off from tourist places in Bali, it's negotiable. Walk away or even dare to say No if you don't want to purchase or join anything. He is helpful in arranging itinerary and based on how everything can fit in with the time you have in Bali. All is well except the northCoast water sports which was a major rip off from the offered/given prices. I find it unfair based on skin colour or different nationalities. We paid 800,000rp just for 3 activities (seawalker excluded) which I feel was too much compare to the price that can be found in other websites. Overall service for it was good, but price was a big spending.Nyoman is the one who's doing Yoga with me in the shared picture."

Out of these 3 luckily 2 was with Bali Sun tours, we did the parasailing with a different company and it was a complete rip off, instead of 8 minutes each we had 2 minutes each. Everything we did with Bali Sun tours on the other hand was worth the money, pick up in the morning was always on time by the very friendly Oka or Mardi, they knew a lot about the places we went to and had so much fun on the day tour and ATV riding that on Oka's recommendation we booked white water rafting as well. In fact he booked it for us for the next day which made it very simple, we didn't need to do anything. The activities we did were among the highlights of our holiday without them it wouldn't have been the same, thank you! And if we ever go again we're definitely booking directly through Bali Sun Tours"

Although Bali Sun tour mentions on their website that they have shower and toilet facilities but these facilities are not in proper working condition. Toilets were stinky and were not suitable for use. Even the shower rooms were nowhere close to being called a shower room. All their trainers need to be polite. I wont book it next time.Next day, I was again picked up from my hotel with my wife by Bali Sun tour Driver \"Made Les\" for White Water Rafting. This time experience was completely different as the driver was very friendly and informative. For Water Rafting, we had \"Bo Bo\" as our trainer and he was amazing person and really funny. I would highly recommend rafting and ask for \"Bo Bo\" as your trainer and trust me you wont be disappointed. Toilets and shower rooms were in really good condition in comparison to water sport facilities and also they will provide you clean towels. Will definitely do it again with \"Bo Bo\".Next day, we were again picked up by our driver \"Made Les\" for \"Bright Bali Tour\" and that too turned out to be amazing experience because of our driver."

Gusti picked us up right on time from our hotel. His vehicle was spotless and we were happy to have him to navigate those hectic Bali roads! Gusti was very knowledgable about the sights we saw (including: Tanah Lot, rice fields, the Luwak Coffee Plantation, and the Batik factory). He was eager to answer all of our questions about the Balinese culture and the Hindu religion. He was also interested to learn about our lives and what our culture was like. We all quickly became friends. We really enjoyed our time with Gusti and decided to book more tours with him. On our second tour we went to Mount Batur for a sunrise climb. Unfortunately, I became very ill after 1km of hiking. I could no longer continue the hike and turned around. I found Gusti in his car with his girlfriend. I felt bad for interrupting their time together but they treated me like family! They allowed me to sit in the car with them and even gave me some local medicine to make me feel better. They were excellent company. Even though I was sick, spending time with them and getting to know them will always be one of my favorite memories of Bali. On our third tour with Gusti, he took us to WaterBom Bali. Gusti was nice enough to score us discounted tickets and even stood in line with us before we went in. As always, he was there right on time to pick us up and even went out of his way to make sure we had enough water for the rest of the night. On our final day with Gusti, he drove us around Kuta to a few more places we wanted to see and he also drove us all to the airport. We were so lucky to have met Gusti. He made our time in Bali much more special and I am happy to now call him my friend. Book this company for a tour! You will not regret it."

He picked us up in Ubud, where we were staying at the time, and we spent the day visiting the rice terraces, the Luwak coffee plantation, the handmade silver, paintings and Batik factory stores and then Tanah Lot Temple. Gusti walked with me while we were on the coast at Tanah Lot and answered my many questions about the Hindu religion, culture and customs. He was so nice and was curious about our culture too :) Later when we asked for a good food recommendation, he took us to a beautiful restaurant on rice terraces with floating huts and a wonderful atmosphere. He patiently waited outside as we ate our late lunch, even though we invited him to join us! We loved Gusti's company so much, we asked him via Facebook to also take us to take us to Mount Batur volcano, for a sunrise climb towards the end of our stay in Ubud. When the day came, he was promptly ready to pick us up at our early 2am start time. Despite the long drive through the winding, dark roads up to Mount Batur, Gusti was very skilled in his driving and I didn't feel nervous at all, which helped me get a little sleep on the way there ;)When we arrived, he set us up with a local climbing guide, Nyoman (who was so incredible!) and planned to sleep in the car while we climbed. Unfortunately one of our friends got very sick early on in the climbing and had to turn back, but Gusti and his girlfriend were gracious enough to make room for her to rest as well and even gave her a little medicine to help her. We were so so grateful for that! When we left Ubud, we were sad to say goodbye, but later on in our trip, while we were in Canggu, we decided to ask Gusti for transportation again :) On a different day, he picked us up at our hotel in Canggu and took us to Waterbom Bali and even got us discounted tickets! Afterwards, he was ready waiting for us early as usual (he's always a few minutes early which is comforting in a foreign country), but when we had issues with the ATM, he patiently waited for us and then drove us to pick up a quick lunch. On our last day, we had Gusti pick us up again in Canggu, with our 4 big suitcases and 4 smaller bags in his vehicle and he drove us to Kuta to spend our last afternoon. He dropped us off at the Hard Rock Cafe, and we were able to explore the beach and area and release van sea turtles while he kept our luggage in his car for the day! He picked us up in the later in the evening and finally drove us to the airport. We were all sad to say goodbye to our favorite personal guide and driver!! He is so sweet and helpful and you would definitely be happy to book Gusti and this company while enjoying your trip in Bali!! Thank you Gusti!!! <3"

Very respectful of our privacy and was informative and educational when the time called for it. He picked us up from our hotel very promptly and was very happy, smiley and friendly throughout the whole day. I can\u2019t fault the service, both over email and once we were with our guide. There was no pressure of time and the amount of time spent at each attraction was very much up to us - which was great.The downsides:Before we set off we were given an itinerary which consisted of what you'll see on the website: Art Villages, Luwak Plantation, Rice Fields, Monkey Forest - Great! We were also told that, if there was time, we could go to see a traditional Balinese dance later in the day, which would be great if we were still interested in that after everything else.We set off and were immediately taken to see the dance/play/performance without being asked if we did actually went to see it. It was quite frustrating, but we rolled with it considering we were already there. However this came with an additional 100,000 Rupiah cost of entry, which we didn't sign up for or agree to! It was too late by that point and we sat through the hour-long performance which was ok. We came out with a decent-enough decorative plate/bowl with our picture on it.We then set off to go to the Art Village. The name is quite deceptive, as you imagine traditional markets/villages selling hand-crafted wares. What we weren't told is that they were two separate shops more than anything - far from a village - although they were hand-crafted.The first was a material/art shop, selling clothes, wicker decorations and some really beautiful paintings. The second was the silver shop which had some lovely pieces of jewellery and more paintings. The two were about a 20-30 min drive apart, so it took up a good couple of hours from the day.We were then asked if we wanted to go to a wood-carving shop, but we decided against that because we thought it would be more of the same. Very basic and brief \u201cdemonstrations\u201d of how items were made and straight into sales-heavy walk-arounds where shop assistants were pressing you to buy their stuff - despite much of it not being allowed into Australia. It seemed as though the drivers/companies were on some sort of commission for taking people there or people buying from there.It was around 5 hours after we left the hotel that we could get into the real good stuff and see the real sights of Ubud without feeling pressured into buying add-ons.The positives:Next up was the Luwak plantation. This was similar to the Art shops in which we were given a demonstration before taken into a shop and expected to buy, however it was a much more friendly and hands-on experience with lots of free add-ons. I\u2019ll write a separate review on that particular plantation on TripAdvisor if you wish to go to my profile and view it. There were no purchasing obligations with the Teba Sari plantation.The rice terrace was an amazing spectacle. Again, we had to pay - this time for parking rather than entry, which seemed strange as we could have just parked on the roadside for free. We were also blocked from going any further on the trail by a woman who demanded a \u201cdonation\u201d and a man who simply repeated \u201cmoney\u201d whilst I was taking photos. The views were breathtaking however, and it was a very nice walk that wasn\u2019t too taxing or exerting. Again, I\u2019ll do a separate review on the Tebalalang Rice Terrace.The pinnacle of the day was going to the Monkey Forest (again, separate review) and it was what we had been looking forward most to throughout the day. There was, again, an entry fee and you could pay for bananas to entice the monkeys to come and jump on you. We didn\u2019t pay, we just found a member of staff and asked him to help us, and he had nuts/berries of some sort to encourage the monkeys. We got some fantastic photos and had a great time.Dinner that evening was at a restaurant in Ubud. The name escapes me and I can\u2019t find any evidence of it online. It had an amazing view out the back, with lush paddies and a giant colourful statue of what I presume to be a God. The food was good - I had a Chinese-style beef dish. The smoke being blown over to our table by the two women from London on the table next to us wasn\u2019t particularly nice while we were eating (we later found out they were also staying at our hotel, so they got the best of our scathing stares). The staff were great and friendly and priced very reasonably.Overall:if you can, try and plan out your day before heading off, and make sure you only go to where you want, otherwise you\u2019ll find yourself paying more on entry fees, tips and other costs than the cost of the actual tour itself.The guide was great, unfortunately didn\u2019t catch his name, but he deserved the pretty large tip we gave him. From my perspective, try to miss out on the morning\u2019s dance/shopping if you don\u2019t want to pay on top of what you have to and get to do the better experiences sooner!"

We were very lucky to have Putu as our driver, he was absolutely amazing and did a wonderful job. He catered to our needs and even took us to see a Barong dance even though this was not part of the original itinerary. He met us at our hotel sharp at 8:30am to ensure we beat the traffic and were able to get the most of out of our day. We were meant to return around 4pm, however he was kind enough to allow us to stay longer at places we wanted to spend more time which was greatly appreciated.We really appreciated Putu's local knowledge and the information he provided us about the places we visited and local customs - the complimentary iced bottled water he provided was definitely much appreciated in the heat.Although entrance fees weren't included in the tour, they were not expensive and we really enjoyed being able to be at each place as long as we liked, without having a time limit.Putu is definitely the best tour guide and driver we had during our stay.Thank you Bali Sun Tours for making our trip even more memorable."

We had a trek down to the river through the forest, which was so beautiful. The rafting was fun, in the dry season the water levels are much lower - so you don't go as fast and you can get stuck on rocks, we still had an awesome time, amazing views - we even saw a monkey on the other side of the River. The waterfalls are lovely, you can take your own pics standing under one, and wade around the river. Lunch was nice, buffet style - which was needed after the day of rafting! I would recommend this to people who like adventure and action, who don't mind exercise! - you do a lot of walking up and down stairs getting to and from the river (which we loved but other people did have trouble). Our tour guide was fantastic too - funny and informative - Thanks Sonic! All in all, a great day!"

Super friendly from the second he met us at the airport. Each day he would always greet us with a smile and was always happy to chat with us and answer all of my partners questions about Bali, its culture and random things we drove past. He was even great about us wanting to add extra things to our itinerary or change things slightly. We did the Mt Batur Climb - this was a great morning despite the grueling climb in the dark. We watched the sun rise from the top of the mountain and then saw the volcano crater and where the monkeys live. Our guide was great, full of information!We also did the Monkey forest, at first i was excited and happy to see all of the monkeys. We had taken very little into the forest with us as it indicated they can try to take your things, all we had was cameras and a water bottle. They love the bottle and were jumping on us to try and take it. I had a baby monkey jump on me and chew on the bottle, which was cute, until the mother came up and started biting me coz she thought i was trying to steal her baby. Id recommend taking bare minimum into the forest, and staying away from the babies. Our final tour was the ATV adventure - this was a great day, although i had never ridden and ATV before and found it quite daunting at first. They give you a very quick run down of the controls and then send you on your way. The course is quite challenging if you don't know what you're doing. We had a lady ride off the edge of the path into a ditch within the first few minutes. I would recommend this if you have done ATVing before as a lot of the course if over a mud track and there are some quite challenging parts. I ended up sideways a few times.All in all Bali sun tours is a great company and i will definitely use them again if i return to bali :)"

Food was average, when we arrived back to the starting point for our buffet lunch, the buffet was almost empty and the remaining food was cold, it took a while to get a top up. But that was a minor negative.We also did an ATV tour, this was average. We did an atv tour on our last bali trip with a different company and were looking forward to this ne as it was a bit more extreme. We were disappointed in the group size (16 people) was far too many especially when alot of people had never ridden an ATV let alone seen one before... withon 5 minutes of the group leaving a girl drove off a bank and rooled her atv.... for the rest of the tour we continuusly had to stop and wait for her and her friend to catch up... this effeced ur time and experience. the bikes also kepot stalling and let out lots of fumes, not nice to be stuck behind that breathing it in.This tour indicates it is fine for beginners, i disgree. Alot of the track was mud and we slid around alot without any control. You drive along a small path with a metre drop to the side, one slip and you would be down the bank. I wouldnt reccommed this tour to anyone who has never ridden an atv, without the understanding how heavy they are and dangerous it can be if you crash or do not know how to steer, break, accerate or change gears, id reccommend the tour we did last year along the beach....."

We had choices that included seeing rice paddies, temples, monkey forest, silver making, batik, spice gardens and the Kopi Luwak coffee process (which I don't recommend because it mistreats Civet cats). We elected to check out the monkey forest (very cool), and asked our driver to take us for the best shopping for silver, batik and furniture...we scored!

Traffic in Bali is haphazard -- at best -- with a set of 'road rules' all their own, but we negotiated all moving obstacles with ease and complete safety, thanks to YOGA'S skill behind the wheel. Not only was YOGA very courteous, and fun to be with, but he cracked as many jokes as we did -- his English language skills were near perfect. Apart from knowing \"all the good places to go to\", he never once forced us into any particular establishment, instead, allowing us to choose where and when to stop. Another 'plus' was the fact that he never once even alluded to expecting more money -- as some do -- and this allowed us to enjoy our days with him, without feeling any pressure for 'the poor, underpaid, driver. (In fact, we have no idea what his wage may have been, as it never came up in conversation.) We can thoroughly recommend YOGA from Bali Sun Tours when you are in need of a driver in Bali, and contact him on yoga7335@gmail.com or info@balisuntours.comfrom 'Mr. John' and 'Mr. Des'."

He was a source of knowledge about anything we wanted to know about. Never hurried us and helped us through all the different arts in Ubud (though my bartering skills need some work!). Loved the whole day and would definitely recommend Wayan and Bali Sun Tours to anyone wanting an insiders guide to Bali. Made our honeymoon trip easy, enjoyable and stress free. Will book again when in Bali."

I booked a full day tour with Bali Sun tours while I was still in NZ. the admin staff were very good at organising the details via email and were very quick with their responses. On the day we were lucky enough to have Nyoman turn up at our resort. He was an absolute pleasure for our whole trip taking us to all sorts of places we wouldn't have otherwise known about. He made our day that much more enjoyable and I will absolutely be recommending him to everyone I know heading to Bali"

Our driver Made was amazing, spoke perfect English, was insightful, polite and knew his stuff inside out. Nothing was an issue. We stayed at three different hotels whilst we were in Bali and it was never a problem to pick us up wherever we were. A couple of minor issues with traffic meant we missed out on something however Made was so accommodating and went out of his way to make sure we saw something else. Both tours were majestic. We loved the Traditional dances, the Temples were so breathtaking and because there were four of us he didn't disappoint in making each one of us comfortable. Made was able to make sure we each did what we wanted to do. Made was an excellent driver and we felt very safe at all times. I couldn't recommend the company or Made enough."

Just like the first time, Surya was an absolute pleasure to book with via email. We asked for the same driver we had last time (Nyoman) because he was so awesome the first time! Unfortunately, he was not available for all of our bookings so we only saw him for our airport transfer on the first night. He was there, at the airport gate with a big smile and a sign with our names. The other drivers we had during this stay were also very lovely. On the second day, Nyoman even called our driver to ensure that he had picked us up on time and was treating us well! (Aw!) Their english is very good, their vehicles are clean, comfortable, and well air conditioned. They are lovely and informative and very flexible on their itineraries. Words can't express how much I recommend you book with these professionals!"

We got picked up promptly from our hotel, and as soon as we got into the car he tried to sell us a fire show. We politely declined but thanked him for the offer.Our first stop was the King's Palace in Ubud. The drive was around 1hr 45mins. It was a lot smaller than I imagined, so we checked out the markets there, much more arty than the markets in Kuta!The tour boasted a suckling pig & buffet for lunch, which I was looking forward to, but for that, we would have to stay in Ubud, and since it was 10.20am, we were not ready for lunch. Our driver then said there was another option for a buffet lunch, without the suckling pig, we opted for that so it would be a better time for lunch.I wish we hadn't, the other option was overlooking Kintamani Volcano & Lake Butar. The view is absolutely stunning but the food - terrible. It was inandated by flies and did not look hygienic at all. My friend & I had to hunt for a clean looking plate and served ourselves a small helping of fried noodles & some funny looking chicken. We felt a bit ill afterwards.After lunch we got some more photos of the lake and had a browse of the street markets there. Then we headed to our coffee tasting! It was the best part of the tour, we got a tour of the plantation, and saw the process of the coffee making. The lady who worked there did a terrific job of this. We then got to have a complimentary tea & coffee taste, there were about 7 different flavours, and they were all so good! We had to pay 50,000rp (5AUD) for the coffe that's been passed through the Civet, but it's well worth it. Very lovely!A short drive later and we were at the Holy Springs. Our driver came in with us and I'm glad he did, he helped explain a lot of things, and let us know when we could take photos and when to put on sarongs ect. They provide sarongs before you enter the Springs for respect, which was handy. It was a great experience! Be aware, there is a fee to use the bathroom 2000rp (.20cents) and you will need your own toilet paper. After you exit the Holy Springs, there is a maze of markets! And to be honest, it's MUCH cheaper than Kuta markets! The ride home was long, and left the both of us feeling travel sick. I think the food we are also had something to do with it. It was good to have a cultural day, and that's what this tour does!"

A great amphitheatre the only thing letting it down was the rudeness of other audience members, many getting up and down throughout the performance and leaving before the end. I believe these were mostly Chinese tourists. After the show we went for dinner at Jimbaran Bay and really enjoyed eating on the beach and being serenaded by the band."

On both occasions we were collected from our resort punctually at the nominated time by courteous drivers in clean, late-model air-conditioned vehicles.The highlight of the Ubud trip was the tea/coffee tasting at the Ubud Luwak coffee plantation that only a local would be able to find. Our driver had earlier taken us to a Barong Dance which happens every morning at 9.30, costs A$10pp and was interesting, but a tad long (1 hour). Yoga, our driver, saw that I'd spotted a Ralph Lauren Polo outlet & happily took us there as well as to a silver factory. The Bali Sun Tour drivers will take you wherever you want to go but if there are parking costs or admission charges, they're your own responsibility.The Sunset Tour was beautiful & climbing the clifftop path to Uluwatu Temple was spectacular. There was a traditional Kecak Fire Dance on offer for A$10pp but we preferred to enjoy the view rather than taking in another hour-long dance performance. Be prepared to pay incidentals like temple admission/sarong hire at Uluwatu plus parking costs when you go to Jimbaran Bay. Dinner at Jimbaran Bay is delightful, dining under the stars enjoying fresh seafood before returning to your accommodation. Check out what restaurants along the strip have on offer (dinner is your own expense).Well done Bali Sun Tours for having so many itineraries on offer & such knowledgable local drivers."

Having heard mixed reviews of Bali - we were impressed with what we experienced with our host Oka.We used Oka for ~6 days during our 9 day stay. Oka stayed with us during the tour and explained all aspects of Balinese culture in great detail with great knowledge of Ubud and neighbouring villages.We started our tour on Friday morning with visit to Sea walk, Flying fish, Jimbaran Bay, Coffee Luwak and Dreamland beach. With plenty of time to enjoy each activity.Saturday and Sunday we had half days due to weather and hotel transfer. Oka was very accomodating and even agreed to enjoy a crazy rain bath at Tanah Lot Temple with us! The two halfdays we covered Tana Lot Temple and another beautiful temple close-by. Sarong factory and silver factory was done during our transfer to Ubud Villa with Oka.Across the next few days we enjoyed - Warung Dance, Sarong Factory, Ubud Locals Market, Monkey Forest, Rice Terrace, Volcano Walk, Temple and Water Blessings, Goa Gajah Cave saving best for last - the White Water Rafting with Oka's cousin Ary. What a fantastic bloke. Down to earth and also very understanding as my wife couldnt swim and it was our first rafting experience. Action packed and not to mention the wonderful foods we tried. Hands down to our host and the wonderful Bslinese locals for making this trip memorable. Thank you Oka, Ary and Bali Sun Tours!"

Oka it would not of been the same without you you not only took us on the Eat Pray Love tour you educated us about Bali and were open to answering our questions. You showed us so much more and were more than available to us. When you were not available due to being booked by someone else you arranged for your brother Gus who was so lovely. You made our trip so much better and through that great experience we have made a friend who we will contact for life and we have and will continue to share our experience with friends and family. Thank you and for anyone travelling to Bali the Eat Pray Love tour was great my hubby and I enjoyed it but we also took the Bali safari park riding the elephant experience on recommendation from Oka and that was our highlight but to also know that this park was the only one 100% owned by the balinese meant allot to us.

We found Sunset tours online and purchased the pack to see Uluwatu , kecak dance and Jimbaran. Not only was it great value for money, but our host \"Gusti\" was so lovely. We felt so welcomed, and he suggested interesting activities and things we could do during our trip. We enjoyed his company so much that we booked him again the next day to go to Ubud, of which he was so helpful and took us to see the Luwak Kopi, Barong dance and explore the rice fields. I have been around other parts of Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia etc) , But I have never met such a welcoming, honest and fun host. Bli Gusti was great company, and made our short time in Bali a great experience, we gained a true friendship out of the experience, and it was so nice to get away from the business of the Kuta area, and explore Bali with a local!. I have reccomended this Tour company to my friends , and would especially reccomend Bli Gusti as the host. His customer service and genuine care for our experience was fantastic!. Thankyou for showing us an amazing time in Bali - we will be back ! Yana , Laura, Emily and Mira - Melbourne, Australia -"

We felt taken care of, always on the lookout in making sure we're okay. He's very eager to interact and learn about our culture, and share with us his culture as well. He didn't make us feel rushed, always patient in waiting in between tours. We felt that we could trust him, so sometimes we'd leave our personla stuff with him, like phones and wallets (especially during the Water Sports Tour). Since he's still young, I believe experience will make him a very very good tourguide in the future, as he has all the basic qualities of one."

We were picked up at 11am at our hotel in Seminyak and drove around 1.5 hours to the location. We got changed into our swimmers and put our life jackets/helmets on, picked up an oar and off we went down to the river. NOTE: the trip down is very steep and slippery, care needs to be taken.Our guide, Made, was great - so funny and controlled the raft really well and had good English and instructed us well. We travelled for 5km through the rapids where we stopped to go swimming, grab a drink, and jump off rocks into the river (if you were game!) then travelled another 5km to the finish point. As we reached the finish point, we jumped out of the raft and swam the final 50m. We walked up to the restaurant where we had showers and got changed and had lunch.We were then driven back to our hotel.It was a well organised and fun day! We took a camera in a plastic bag and they provided us with a water proof bag to place it in. We suggest having a change of clothes for the end.Our guide, Made, went out of his way to make our trip enjoyable and fun!!!Highly recommended!!"

Apart from the buzz of the rapids & the amazing scenery, our guide made the experience so much fun, laughing & joking with us the whole time (my teenage daughter thought he was very \"upbeat\"). Lunch was lovely with equally pleasing views from the restaurant over rice fields (although the walk from the river partly along the road was a bit hairy). Fresh towels were handed out and a shower was offered too. The trip back to the Hotel was equally as comfortable and we were able to leave when we were ready. I would highly recommend this tour for anyone visiting Bali - an experience to remember. Don't forget a plastic bag to put your valuables in while your in the raft. Thank you Bali Sun Tours.

We enjoyed our day so much we booked Oka to pick us up a few day later to look at a few temples and do some shopping, and we finished the day watching the sun set at a sea food restaurant in Jambarung, which was just spectacular and a fantastic way to finish off our time in Bali."

The water sports was pretty full on with lots of people but we enjoyed the sea walker and got it for the group on price of $49 each.

Thanks Nyoman, Wayan and Bali Sun Tours for making our honeymoon trip worth it!"

It worked out to be around $25aud for an Ubud private tour including Luwak coffee, ubid rice paddies, the monkey forest and the art village. The driver was due to pick us up from out hotel at 830am, he was there and ready to go at 820am. He spoke excellent english and was actually from Ubud so he had alot of local knowledge of the area.His driving was safe and reliable and he didnt appear to be speeding at any stage. We left bags in the van at each place and he stayed with them for us. He also had a very friendly demanour.Our tour was meant to go from 830-230 but he told us that there was no other bookings for the day and we ended up getting back to our hotel at 430pm and he didnt charge us any extra. I'd recommend using Bali Sun Tours for anyone wishing for a great day out with reliable and safe service."

Picked us up at mid night from the airport no worries (even had the sign with our name on it). Was friendly and polite straight away, shoed away the pesky taxi drivers trying to take advantage of you when you first come out the doors of the airport..Over the course of ten days we used him prob 5 of those days on and off, he was sooo easy to deal with, very knowledgeable of places to go or places not to go. nothing was ever to much trouble everything is always 'ok' with Oka!he is happy to wait around for you to finish dinner or whatever it is you are doing.. or if you invite him in for a beer or dinner will normally happily pull up a seat and have a chat!MAKE SURE you get Oka to take you to where the \"locals eat\" its called a Warung. omg some of the best food you will ever eat... each one specialises in different things depending on what part of Bali you are in and he knows the best ones and you won't get sick!! Suckling pig mmmmmmm.i could go on for ever here but i will cut it short all in all Oka really made our holiday AMAZING with out him i feel we would have had the amazing cultural experience we did.

I continuously asked my Guide Nyoman heaps of questions and he was only to happy to share with me his knowledge of Bali and its culture. I felt safe at all times and I don't think i would have got the same experience if I had of hired a random driver to drive me around. Its the little thinks like letting me know how to behave around monkeys and which hand to use for purification. Its always hard for someone who wants to respect another culture to feel comfortable because you worry so much about making mistakes...but i felt fine. I went on the Luminous tour and the Ubud Tour. The Barong dance was cool, the temples were amazing and I loved the restaurant at the volcano. The food was lovely and so inexpensive. The next trip we went to the monkey forest and to Ubud and we also looked at the process of making Batik...Its my first time to Bali so Nyoman helped me to understand local custom and that's what i'm there for to learn.....so Wow and that's all i can say. Totes recommend. Do take a camera, sunblock, water and a hat and be prepared to be amazed"

The length of this tour (about 5 hours) suited both the older and younger people in our group. Surya kindly arranged this tour for us on short notice and Wayan was our guide. He was very friendly and provided us with some basic background information. This tour included a visit to Uluwatu temple (which included a kecak dance performance) and dinner on the beach at Ganesh Cafe (Seafood restaurant), Jimbaran. The location of the temple (on a cliff) was amazing! The temple itself was closed off to tourists so we walked around the temple grounds (not very large) took pictures of the astounding views and monkeys. Be sure to keep your belongings in your vehicle if possible (sunglasses etc.) as these monkeys take whatever they can, edible or not. We saw one with a coin purse it had pinched from a fellow tourist!The view from the outdoor theatre overlooking the ocean was breathtaking. We were told that on a less cloudy day, we would have had a better view of the sun setting. We paid a little less than USD 10 for each adult (half price for kids) to watch the kecak dance (this is in addition to the $2 we paid to enter the temple grounds). The kecak dance started off on a serious note and quickly became farcical after the second act. The kecak chorus was quite unusual and kept the show moving along. After the show ended, we made our way to Jimbaran for dinner. If you feel cold with wind blowing, do bring along a light jacket/sweater so you can comfortably enjoy dinner on the beach. The ordering process was a bit chaotic. The red snapper we ordered (sweet sour style) was tasty. The rest of it was average. The seafood fried rice was cold when it arrived and the prawns were over-cooked. I wouldn't opt go back to this restaurant even though the fish was quite good. Wayan was great! I hope to take another tour with Bali Sun Tours when I return to Bali."

Words can explain how considerate and knowledgable our driver (Norman) was, there was no doubt he went above and beyond on this first outing. I was travelling with my sister and mother and agreed we needed our Norman back for a other day of touring and again he exceeded. I would recommend Bali sun tours and Norman to any one I know traveling to Bali. By far the best!!!!"

Did not regret choosing Bali Sun to organise and coordinate all the tours during my entire stay. Everything ran smoothly and I totally enjoyed all the tours even though I was a solo traveler. Knowledgeable guides and personalised service. Will definitely ring them up again if I do ever drop by Bali again, be it for a business or leisure. It was one of the best business trips combining both work and r&r!"

Agree that Bali Safari and Marine Park is a great destination for rare animals because not only had I great recreation place, we also get many new knowledge from educational shows. Having a \u201ctiger package\u201d with Bali Sun Tours, I had totally satisfying a full day trip at Bali Safari and Marine Park. My friends and I get crazy to take photos even at entrance because there is a lobby called Lobby Barong that\u2019s just so Balinese :DOur steps stopped to take photos again in front of Hanoman Stage, statues gallery of Ramayana. Sure there are statues of Hanoman itself, Rahwana and others. We didn\u2019t go inside because I insisted to take a safari tour by bus, of course. Luckily I had sat near the window so I could clearly what is outside. A young guide started to tell us about animals living there. I felt amazed seeing three zebras coming near to our bus. Then, we see rhinoceros, a sunbathing hippopotamus lol, tigers, and other wildlife creatures that have their uniqueness. \u201cWe are no longer in Bali, here is Africa\u201d my friend joked. But yeah, it showed us the riches of wildlife rare animals either in Indonesia or in Africa. After that, we were gladly welcomed by professional elephant trainers. Both of the elephant and trainer were ready to show! I heard so many \u201cwow\u201d when the elephants fulfilled its trainer\u2019s command. Then, we were having lunch at Uma restaurant, luckily we came on Sunday then we could watch traditional dance performance. In short, I enjoyed my tour in Bali Safari Marine Park that ended with sightseeing fresh water aquarium where we could see thousand fish. Thanks Bali Sun Tours\ufeff for giving the great and worth scheduled package!"

He gave us good deals on everything we did and every single activity we did ran smoothly. The one time we booked NOT through Bali Sun Tours was the one thing we didnt like, so continued to book through their company. MY friends who were in bali at the same time as us were booking through the street stalls everyone back home tells you to book at and they were being ripped off on comparison to us, and said their tours were no where near as good as ours. Surya is an excellent host for Bali, so cheerful and genuinely wanting to provide the best for all his customers.

The forest was so thick and green with vines hanging down the tall trees, falling leaves, bird chirping, total opposite of all the crowd and the buzz in US. The price was reasonable and I had a river guide who was the very definition of friendliness with an air of professionalism in his every rafting advices and guidelines. He provided us with waterproof bag and towel too. The safety equipment was international standardized, added with insurance cover hence I could put my worries aside.

We did parasailing, banana boat, and jet ski. I wanted to do snorkeling at first, but the staff advised me not to because they were worried of my health, so I agreed with activities that did not include submerging myself under water. I was really thankful for the advice, if not I wouldn't be able to enjoy the last 3 days. Thank you for caring, Bali Sun Tour, I really appreciated it.The parasailing was so much fun, when I was on the sky I saw the beauty of Bali, the vast blue ocean surrounding the brown sandy shore, that was a breath-taking view to take. The blazing sun was a nice compliment for the chilling ocean breeze so I was comfortable up there. It seemed that Bali Sun Tours chose the right time to be that high. That was awesome and really thoughtful!The banana boat and jet ski were enjoyable. The instructor explained how to drive the jet ski very clearly and even tested us whether we understood his explanation or not, a detail man with detail explanation. 3 hours on the beach was not enough because Bali Sun Tours made our holiday so enjoyable. The staffs were so helpful too right from the very beginning when we were scheduling up to when the driver took us back to my hotel.Bali Sun Tours gave me a marvelous holiday in Bali. Fantastic holiday agent! Please help with my next trip too!"

It was pouring rain, the driver was early and greeted us with an umbrella so we didn't get wet. He introduced himself as Made.We got in the very comfy A/C van and explained we didn't really know where to go for shopping, so we'll leave it to him. Made suggested quite a few places including Geneva, matahari, kuta art market, discovery, and took us to quite a few others along the way and also took us for lunch @ Bubba Gumps. Nothing was at all to much trouble, being pregnant, I wanted to look at baby stuff, Made even walked me to the baby sections of the department stores to show me !Made was obliging, courteous and his English was 10/10. He also took us to a bank to exchange money along the way.....bringing us back to our villa at 4.30 via Seminyak square to pick up some dresses that I had made a few days earlier to accommodate my expanding belly.I would recommend this driver to anyone visiting Bali, he certainly looked after us!

Our day tour was completely flexible and determined by what we had done already and his great recommendations. We couldn't recommend Wayan enough. The highlight for us was visiting the village at Lake Batur to see the local farmers growing cabbages, chilli peppers, tomatoes etc. without another tourist in sight, topped off with an amazing view of Mount Batur.

            "review": "Great driver with flexible schedule . First I will say I hired wayan because he was the driver who was willing to pick me up at an early time to get the day started. Earlier time was an advantage in a few ways. We were always the first ones at the sites, so no lines, and no other tourists in my pictures. Also no parking fees because it wasn't technically open yet, that was a bonus. We did the water temple (first ones there) and were able to experience it in peace and quiet. After we did the rice fields which were also lovely and empty. He took us to a healer who was great and then we headed to the waterfall of my choice. Skipped the touristy one and went to nungnung instead which was incredible (also tourist free outside of a few people) Wayan was very kind and easy to talk to and was open to little side trips and stops. Like he knew my friend was looking for spices so took us to a few markets in between sights to look for them. Even though the waterfall I chose was farther away than the touristy one he never discouraged it and actually said we made a better choice. Price was very good and since we left so early- 6am- our day was complete around 3 so I was still able to do other things. the car was clean and new and he was a safe and courteous driver that answered any questions I had about culture and local customs. Thank you Wayan!"

We had not booked anything to the airport to the next morning and were just going to do it with the hotel, but Wayan was so wonderful we used him for our trip to the airport the next day. He is so nice and always gives you facts about the area which we loved! If you need a driver for anything while in Bali, this is the company to use. They do tours and we wish we would have hired him while we were in Ubud. Thanks Wayan!"

            "review": "Faultless service from Made, at a very reasonable price. We got in touch with several drivers in Ubud over Whatsapp and found Wayan prompt and helpful with our questions so decided to book one of his drivers for the day. After spending the first day with one of his drivers, Made, we then extended to a further two days plus a transfer to our next hotel in Nusa Dua.We found Wayan and Made completely open to the itinerary we had already researched and planned for our first day, so we literally had the freedom to do whatever we wished when we wished. The elephant park, rice terraces, and the herons were first up, with Made suggesting particular destinations when, for example, we decided we wanted to visit at temple at the last minute.Made experience proved invaluable in taking us to the more secluded and lesser known spots too - when visiting the rice terraces he took us to a quieter and very picturesque spot well away from the crowds, allowing us to experience a far more serene visit (picture a quaint coffee shop overlooking the terraces), before driving us to the main strip in Tegalalang which was an entirely different affair at the opposite end of the spectrum (think tens of tourist coaches, street hustlers, and hundreds of tourists). Had we experienced the latter alone, we probably would have departed with a different view on the area.As the extra cost per hour after the initial booking was quite reasonable, we also requested Made take us to a nearby top-rated bar/restaurant to save some money on taxis later in the evening, After a quick visit, he once again delivered a perfect personal recommendation for a restaurant on our way back at a venue we'd have never come across on TripAdvisor as it was hidden away in the rankings (Bridges, Ubud). The food and service were impeccable, so top marks to Made for the suggestion.We used Made a second day for a shopping trip to Sukawati, to the nearby waterfall, another personal recommendation from him to visit Cening Bagus for some fixed-price shopping, and for the night safari - tickets for which were arranged for us at the last minute by Wayan, and seemingly unavailable online anywhere else.Our third trip with Made was to climb Mount Batur. He again turned up promptly for our 3am start and dropped us off with one of his colleagues, Komang, who was Wayan's recommended guide up the volcano. The journey up the mountain was difficult but the end-result was spectacular, and Wayan's chosen guide was great throughout (helpfully assisting my partner in the more difficult parts of the climb). We finished the day off at the hot springs.Thoroughly recommended!"

Orba collected us from our hotel in Kuta and brought us to all the sites we wanted to go. He even suggested a couple of places we had not thought of and we were delighted he did. Orba was extremely knowledgeable about Bali as a whole, it's culture and history and specifically about all the places we stopped at during the day. Orba was more than just a driver, he was our own personal tour guide. We were so happy with Orba that we booked him for another day tour while in Ubud. We would certainly be recommending Orba to anyone going to Bali who wants to take a day trip to the major sites (and some of the lesser known places). You will not be disappointed."

We had an early morning pick up to climb Mount Batur and Wayan came super early, with a smile on his face to pick us up for the long journey.Wherever he took us, he would speak to the sites on the way, knowing the rich history behind each statue or building. It was impressive. When we needed to stop for food, the bathroom or anything he would stop and stand closely by to make sure we were okay.I strongly stand by him as anyones tour guide. I was made to feel comfortable and learned a ton under his watch. In fact, I just recommended him to my cousin for his upcoming trip. Thanks for an amazing service1"

He then took us to the Hot springs and temple Pura Batur. From the lake the views of mount Agung and Kintamani were amazing.

Attracted by excellent comments to the Bali Ari Tours, I texted to the company to enquiry for making a 1-day tour to the Kintamani, Jatiluwih rice paddy, Ulan Danu temple, etc. before my trip to Bali. Wayan replied me and gave me very good suggestions on the trip planning as well as reasonable quotation. Without hesitation, I extended the 1-day tour to 2 days and visited more spots which were all remarkable! My trip was made in late August with another Wayan, Mr Wayan Suardane. He spoke very good English. He gave us very detailed explanation on the tourist sites, Bali traditional culture and history. With friendly manner, my kids, aged 5 and 7, liked him too. My little son even preferred to stay him when he felt tired and not go with us into a temple. Also, he drove safely and smoothly. The car was pretty clean.Thanks to Wayans for making a good memory to us. We really enjoyed the 2 full-days tours very much. Surely, we need your help next time when we visit Bali again and will recommend your service to any of our friends."

After browsing through Trip Advisor I decided to contact Wayan and ask him for help. His response was extremely quick and very friendly.

When one of Wayan's drivers, Wayan Suwardana, arrived at my resort at exactly 8am that we agreed, it didn't take me too long to put all my worries to the side. He appeared to be a lovely and kind gentleman. He made feel very welcomed and safe too. He took me to all the places I wanted to visit and even suggested to stop at a few other ones that were not on my list.Thanks to him I saw even more than I planned! His car was very clean and well air conditioned.Wayan gave me enough time to explore the areas and even told me some stories about the places we visited. He had a great knowledge and what's more, his English was amazing! We chatted nearly all the time which was nice and exchanged lots of stories too. On top of that, Wayan turned up to be a really good photographer! He took lots of lovely pictures for me and what surprised me the most was that I didn't really have to ask him to take pictures - he offered to do it by himself which i feel grateful for. :-)I can highly recommend Bali Ari Tours to anyone visiting Bali and staying in Ubud.They provide a great service and experience that comes with it.I would like to say a special 'thanks in a million' to Wayan Suwardana who made my trip very special and enjoyable and also - a big thank you for making sure that i got to the airport on time. :-)Thank you Bali Ali Tours.All the best to you all and good luck in the future!:-)Agnieszka"

Bali Ari cars and Wayan Suardana were one of the best and memorable experience.The car was a new and well maintained one. There were rear A/C vents and the cooling was good. The driver was professional and on time. He didnt over speed, he used proper signals and obeyed traffic rules. We hired Wayan Suardana as our driver but he also served as our tour guide + photographer + translator. He was good in English and we were able to understand each other easily. He also helped by translating some of the calls that I received(were the caller was speaking broken English or Balinese). He knew Bali very well and told us about the history it and various Balinese traditions. Being an Indian, the Balinese way of life seem very familiar to ours. Each place that we visited, he parked the car and escorted us. Whenever we wanted him to click a snap, he did with a smile(thank you Wayan the pics came out really well, and it is one of our treasured memories). I would definitely avail the Bali Ari Tours and Wayan S. again. I will recommend my friends and family too. I vouch for a wonderful experience from them."

We enquired about a day tour with Wayan the evening before we wanted to travel, to our delight he replied within 5 minutes and offered a competitive price for a full day tour (8-10 hours). We gave him a rough itinerary of things we wanted to do and he planned a route to make sure we could see everything we had hoped to.Whilst the sights that we saw on the day were great, Wayan went the extra mile to make our day even better. Not only is he friendly and easy to speak to, he also is extremely knowledgeable and acted as our tour guide for the day. This helped us make the most of our day as we really understood the places we were visiting, rather than just looking at them. Without his company, I don't think we would have enjoyed the trip half as much. In addition to being a safe driver and knowledgeable tour guide, Wayan also took photos for us throughout the day - we were impressed with how good they were, he knows how to take a well-balanced shot.I highly recommend Wayan to anyone who wants a safe drive around the sights of Bali, whilst also learning lots of interesting things along the way. If I could give 6 stars I would!!"

On the last day I had a few hours before having to get to the airport so I did some checking around to hire and car and driver to see a couple of places I was interested in. I wrote to a few and settled on Bali Ari, mainly because of the great email responses and willingness to cater to exactly what I wanted as I am a photographer and I had very specific things in mind. I didn't realize the distances and traffic conditions so we weren't sure if we'd make all three stops in the time we had. My driver, Made, was determined to deliver me to my destinations and he did it with time to spare. More importantly, he was a delight as we exchanged laughs as well as him providing all sorts of information. Whatever I asked, he was able to answer. He spoke very good english and made the day the best it could be. When I went to reception to check out, he was already there, 20 minutes early so off we went. I HIGHLY recommend using a private car and driver in Bali as the cost is extremely reasonable and you get a wonderfully tailored tour to what you want. I'm sure they are able to suggest things as well if you don't know what you want to see. There are many companies in Bali doing private tours but I would not hesitate to recommend going directly to Wayan and Bali Ari Tours. I've done many private tours and this rated right up there as one of the best. Absolutely FIRST RATE!"

He quickly responded to our numerous emails, and his excellent English skills made for easy communication throughout.Thank you, Wayan! Hope to see you again the next time we are in Bali."

This was last minute decision to hire private guide for our stay in Ubud, so I looked though TA list and contacted Bali Ari Tours while sitting at Makassar airport waiting for the connection flight to Denpasar - reply was almost immediate and we were lucky to quickly book Wayan Suardana for the next full day trip to main Ubud attractions (namely, Water temple, Monkey forest, Volcano, rice terraces and coffee plantation). Wayan also suggested to add Tegenungan waterfall and Gunung Kawi temple to our itinerary, which were really worth visiting. For the second day Wayan suggested very good deal for rafting, so do not hesitate to ask Bali Ari guides on possible deals. Total price was very reasonable and there was no need to bargain (this fact I personally also liked).Due to our flight significant delay we started next day at 10 am and still managed to visit almost all attractions, except for agreed skip of too overcrowded Water temple and soon closing Monkey Forest, which was transferred for the next morning before rafting. During our tour he gave us relevant explanations on the Ubud history, attractions specifics and other details. The cars he used both days were very clean, fresh water provided, we felt absolutely safe and comfortable, as Wayan was always ready to help in every possible way. As local food lovers we joined Wayan for lunch at some local warung and totally enjoyed it. Finally, we also agreed on airport transfer on our last day and again he was at the hotel on time, quick, helpful and very welcoming.So we both strongly recommend hiring Wayan for your Bali visit sightseeing or airport transfers! I wish Bali Ari Tours further development and plenty of customers. Thanks a lot!"

I also booked return airport transfer. Wayan was waiting for me coming off of my flight with a big bottle of water and helped me with my luggage to his car & took me to my hotel an hour away (did I mention this was at 1am?). Wayan had said he would be my driver the duration of my trip but due to unforeseen circumstances, he had to change my driver to Made. I didnt mind this at all! These things happen & as long as I still had a driver, it was all good! Made is wonderful!! He is informative, chatty, great English & funny! He came into temples with me and spoke to me about the history (fascinating!) & took pictures of me but wasn't intrusive when i wanted to wander along taking it all in.

Before the trip, I had sent many inquiries about our route and location information as this was our first time for visiting Bali. And Wayan had replied me in very detail by every email and inquiry, the responses are quick and helpful which can solve all of our problem. During our trip of the two days service, our guide Wayan (he is another Wayan, may be they are cousins) is a very good man who had taken care us very well. His driving is very safety and on time, and he would try the best to take us to the location within a best time. (let say, the time to catch the sunset). Moreover, the detailed explanation and description are provided for us for some sightseeing and historical place, and he also told us some stories and culture about Bali. We feel happy and safe for visiting Bali with Ari Tour and Wayan. Thank you for giving us an unforgettable trip in Bali. If we visit Bali in next time, we must choose this again. See you next time!!"

We used there airport pick up and drop off service and did a half day tour.Wayan is quick with emailing back and answered everything I asked. I emailed this company 6 months in advance and then 2 months before our trip and Wayan still remember who I was! Felt like we were pin pals. Our driver was Wayan Balik, and he took care of my boyfriend and I. Safe driver all around, never rushed us when visiting a site, fill with information about Bali. Wayan English is great and understandable. I have nothing but good things to say about this tour company. Definitely recommend booking with this company and if you get lucky to have Wayan Balik as your driver he'll take great care of you."

Arrived in Ubud on March 3rd and spent the day getting massages, mani pedi, shopping and simply exploring the surrounding places near our accommodation, Alaya Hotel. That night we decided to book a guide for the following day as we wanted to see more places in Ubud. After reading multiple positive reviews on Tripadvisor, I called Bali Ari Tours and spoke to Pak Wayan. He arranged for Pak Made to be our guide. Let's just say from then on, everything went super amazing! Made picked us up from our hotel and we were comfortable with him from the start! He was friendly, kind, patient, accommodating, and we felt safe with him the whole time. We were so grateful to have him as our guide and so we booked him again the next day, and the day after and again the day after for our trip to other parts of Bali and for transfer to airport. If you are visiting Bali and looking for a guide, I highly recommend Pak Made - you'll be well taken care of! If you don't speak Indonesian, he does his tour in English as well. Pak Made if you are reading this, thank you for your excellent service. We hope to see you again in the near future. = )"

Even though you didn't recommend going up to the volcano in the afternoon tours due to visibility and inclement weather, we sure lucked out. Every aspect of the tour was great - good communication before and after the tour, nice clean car, good knowledge of the Balinese culture, and we didn't feel rushed at all. Thanks also for helping us find a delicious beach front dinner spot on the way back to the hotel. Wayan was also the driver the next day to take us to the airport at 6:30am ... what a nice guy :-) A suggestion maybe to build in the road and toll charges so the guests wouldn't have to keep pulling out cash. All in all, a wonderful tour with Wayan. See you next time in Bali."

Upon planning our stay in Ubud we came across Bali Ari Tours and thanks to other great reviews we booked a private day tour. Bali Ari Tours was very prompt via email and the price was terrific. When we arrived in Ubud, Wayan emailed that we would have an English speaking guide. Well, we were lucky to get Wayan himself. He arrived at our hotel promptly and advised the hotel he was waiting. Wayan had a very comfortable car with water. He took us all over Ubud and Karangesm based on my plans to see certain sites. Wayan spoke English very-well and answered a million of my questions with such enthusiasm. He also made it very easy to experience Bali and of course offered great advice to do/see things that weren't on my original itinerary but well-worth it. Like see Mt Batur and I wanted to try mangosteen so he stopped on the side of the road to get me some. After 8 hours of driving and touring us around, we asked Wayan to be our transport the next day from Ubud to Seminyak. Again, he was prompt and very affordable compared to hotel transport costs. I highly recommend Wayan for any tour or transport needs. I can't wait to go back and have him assist us again. Thanks Wayan!"

We scouted around in Trip Advisor and came upon Bali Ari Tour. We wrote to them and had immediate reply from Mr Wayan Balik. It was a concise reply from them about rate, driver's name and other info that I required to make my immediate plan and decision. We sent in our planned itenary, and they added a few more place of interest along the same route.We choose Mr Wayan Suardana as our driver. He was punctual in getting to our hotel, His English is good and well verse with the history of Bali. Apart from visiting the temples, he gave us quite a detail history of Bali, Hinduism and their practices in Bali, which is slightly different from its original place, India. We were uncertain about our plan for the next day, whether to travel by road transport or boat transport. By the time we decided and wrote to Mr Wayan Balik, it was late night. Next morning, Mr Wayan turn up to the hotel in time to provide the good service to us. My additional appreciation is that the first day of my tour is actually the first day of their Hari Galungan, which is their \"New Year\" day, while the second day of my tour is their Hari Kuningan which is second day of their New Year."

I first booked a tour package from my hotel which just included a driver who would drive me to the destination stated in the package. The next morning I thought to myself that the tour package provided by the hotel was not worth it so I decided to cancel it. The reason why I cancelled the hotel tour package was because it was quite pricey and it only included a driver and not a private tour guide who could show me around and give me information of the tourist attractions in Bali, which was what I was looking for. After cancelling, I looked through a couple of tour agencies and came across Ari tour guides. I sent them an email in the morning and they gave me a swift reply stating the prices of the tour packages and what was included in them. I decided to book an 8 hour tour with Wayan at 11am on the day itself but I was thinking to myself that my booking might be rejected due to the short notice. To my surprise, my booking was accepted and Wayan came to pick me up from my hotel lobby. He arrived about 15 minutes before the requested time and was waiting in the lobby for me. He is a very nice tour guide and it was easy to communicate with him. While we were on our way to the destinations, he was providing me with information of the history and cultural background of the people and locations which we were going to visit. Once we reached the destinations he would show me around and also explain to me the cultural/historical significance of the locations. The 8 hours was well spent. I would recommend Wayan to anyone who is looking for a private tour guide because he is very flexible with his timing and knowledgeable of the culture/history of Bali."

But first, we needed to drive from Ubud to drop off my girlfriend at the airport, as she took an earlier flight. After that was done, we headed up the coast to Tanah Lot and along the way, Wayan gave amazing details about Balinese culture and daily life and his family's history, and I finally got to taste an authentic \"spinning pig\" at a locals-only joint - no other tourists around, which was a first!While at Tanah Lot, he informed me about the temples on the island and warned of the oncoming masses to watch the evening's sunset. We then quickly headed for Pedang Pedang beach, a hidden cliff-side beach which requires descending 100+ steps down the face. We were rewarded with a calm beach and a warm cup of Balinese coffee before the heavy clouds arrived. Noting the darkening sky, we sprinted to Uluwatu temple at the south tip of the island to witness a beatuful cloud-lit sunset while a pair of aggressive monkey troops battled over nearby territory. Wayan was very patient with my need to capture the moment with a few panoramic photos.Lastly, we bravely ventured into Kuta, as I avoided it during the entire trip, but was curious why the Aussies enjoyed it so much. It started to rain immediately upon our arrival, but Wayan kept in good spirits as we laughed at the contrast to Kuta. After a 35 traffic-laden minutes, we passed the location of Bali bombing and shortly escaped the city.In summary, Wayan was an amazing and knowledgeable tour guide and a safe driver. He has been doing this for years and his English is fantastic and you would never know he was self-taught. I would definitely book his services again!"

Disappointment withstanding, in Nov 2015, my husband and I took a 2 months 6-country around the world tour which we included Bali as on one of the 6 stops. We had 6 days and I modified our 2014 itinerary to fit the longer duration we would have in Bali. We took in many temples, and more temples as we had already travelled extensively over the years around the world, but the Balienes temples are different from other Asian countries'. We took in palaces, the volcano, gardens, and the botanico gardens. I am sure there were other attractions too as each day was activities filled, but can't recall without referring to our notes as we were traveling for two months.Wayan was our driver. He was knowledgeable and patient in explaning the different sights and the Balinese culture to us and answered the many questions we had. He was a very safe driver which is important as I am a very nervous passenger (only trust my own driving, does not sound familiar anyone?). He was very considerate at all times to our needs and comfort and never pushy. He made our touring a very enjoyable experience.We would highly recommend this company. They respond to your enquiry promptly and deliver what they promise. I have no basis to compare the fee they charge as we never bothered to check other co since we were satisfied with their response from the get go (aborted 2014 trip, then our subsequent 2015 trip). But for the attentiveness and safe driving, we are more than happy with what they charge. Thank you Wayan for doing such a good job. Just a pointer, if you don't know what to see, ask them to suggest an itinerary suited to your preference. We knew what we wanted so that was not an issue. But I bet you even if you didn't spend time to research (as I did), you'd still come out ahead of you ask Wayan. They are very helpful."

He was very polite, provided great customer service and had good knowledge of the attractions we visited. He also recommended some nice restaurants for lunch and gave us a few different options to suit our budget. He was also very understanding when my 6 old was travel sick!We visited a very high quality artist community and wood carving community where we able to pick up some great pieces of art. We also used him to drop us off in Seminyak at the end of day 2 as we were moving hotels and this included helping to find our villa which was off the main road and hard to find. I would definitely use his services again in the future when we return to Bali!"

We didn't really know anything about Bali or what to do there. Wayan made great recommendations and took us to all his favorite local and touristy spots. His English was great too so it was easy to talk with him throughout the sites and the car rides. He took us to local markets for shopping and food and knew which sites were the best for coffee, souvenirs, rice fields, etc. He always had bottled water for and was easy to contact using Whatsapp on our phone. We spent half a day when we arrived without him and it was a tad boring but once we met up with Wayan, Bali became an amazing exploration for us."

Having done my research on TA I contacted Wayan Balik prior to commencing our trip and, true to all the comments, received a very rapid positive response to our tour proposals. My husband\u2019s and my requirements were not simple. Due to health issues (arthritis of knees and back problems) I needed to make our tour of Bali very bespoke to avoid steps and steep paths \u2013 from research I established that so many of Bali\u2019s sights involve 100\u2019s of steps! We also prefer to steer clear of tourist destinations where possible (not always achievable if you want to see beautiful sights) so as to experience the real life, people and culture of the country. We are also very keen shutter bugs. All our needs were met. Our guide was extremely patient throughout, both with our walking speed and photo stops and was a mine of information, answering all our questions.Tour 1 North/southwest \u2013 Ubud \u2013 the lakes \u2013 Tanah Lot \u2013 Ubud (10 hrs) $50Big Trees farm Bamboo Chocolate factory \u2013 only open for tours in the afternoon, no photos, but if you  go up to the top floor to the caf\u00e9/sales area you can see through the windows to the production areas on route.  Entirely made of bamboo the structure is interesting.Taman Ayung, the Mengwi Royal Palace \u2013 a pleasant strollA Luwak coffee and spice garden \u2013 this was not on our plan and a definite tourist venue, but we learnt about the  various spices and sampled the coffees.Bedugul, Ulun Danu temple \u2013 we stopped on the side of the road and saw the temple from a distance, but what was  interesting was the fishing activities on lake Beratan.Hillside lunch stop \u2013 Not planned and a luke warm buffet solely for tourists but it did afford a good view of the 3  mountains and rice terraces.Jembong waterfall \u2013 not very well known and therefore very few visitors. It is a few miles passed GitGit up a local  pot-holed road, even our guide had not been before. A local villager (English speaking) joined us on our walk (incl  about 40 steps) up to the simple but beautifully laid out waterfall \u2013 it turned out he was the local elected mayor.The twin lakes \u2013 Buyan and Tamblingan \u2013 a photo opportunityRice fields \u2013 seeing the workers was again a photo opportunityTanah Lot to see the temple at sunset \u2013 despite our guide\u2019s best efforts we made it just as the last slither of sun  set\u2026.HOWEVER after another 10 mins (most tourists had gone) the sky was glorious and totally worth the drive.  After which our guide introduced us to some very tasty freshly made sweets, before setting off for home.We enjoyed our tour so much that we arranged another and Wayan Suardane was our patient, very knowledgeable, very worldly guide, who totally understood our wishes. He answered all our questions on absolutely any topic and was proud to introduce us to Bali life, on our planned bespoke route as far from the main tourist trail as possible.Tour 2 North/southeast \u2013 Ubud \u2013 Lake Batur \u2013 salt mining \u2013 Ubud (8 hrs) $50Tegallalang \u2013 the archetypal rice terracesTirta Embul \u2013 Holy Water templeDrive north on JI Raya Pujung/JI Raya Sakaan \u2013 local villages, rice fields and views.Penelokan \u2013 view of Mt Batur and it\u2019s lakeLunch \u2013 Wayan stopped by a local market, at our request. The food prepared and served was very local so eventually  we decided to play safe with our delicate western stomachs and opted for food from a supermarket and delicious  cakes from a local bakery. The 3 of us had a great laughter filled picnic.Tenganan village \u2013 original layout of ancient village community. This was a significant tourist sight but we were the only  tourists at the time of our visit.Kusamba \u2013 beach salt mining farm, just before the Goa Lawah temple. Wayan came with us to explain the process.  Very interesting.Celuk \u2013 the silver and gold district. Driving through early eve (shops/galleries closed) this area is a world away from  normal village commerce.  We had two wonderful days touring with excellent guides. Baliaritours were happy to undertake our tours tailored to our needs. If we make it back then you will only be a phone call away! Many thanks to the team."

My husband had lost his bank card on the morning of the tour, so before we started the tour Wayan took us to a shop where we could make a call to England so we could sort that out before we started. He was really accommodating and adapted the schedule so we could still fit everything in. We went to various temples, to a little planation to try local teas and coffees, to the rice terraces, and we finished the day watching the sunset at Tanah Lot. We really enjoyed the day and Wayan was a really good guide, explaining everything and advising about the best things to see. I particularly enjoyed visiting the temples with Wayan, because he really made them come alive. He and his family are part of the Hindu community and the temples and ceremonies are part of their daily lives, so we were able to get a really special insight into the community around the temple, not just the buildings themselves. We enjoyed our day with Wayan so much that we arranged a second day with him, when we went to the Elephant park at Taro, the holy water temple and a waterfall - again, another really enjoyable day.The tour prices were really reasonable, and Wayan was inspiring, helpful and trustworthy - and also a very good driver, which isn't always the case in Bali. We would thoroughly recommend him and would definitely use him again."

He was always very friendly, and positive throughout the entirety of the tours. He always arrived early, and it was never a hassle even when we were running late to get out of our villa and get the tours under way. His english was great, his vehicle was clean and well maintained, and he provided us with bottled water each day. He was thoughtful, helpful, and went above and beyond our expectations time and time again. We were glad to make a friend in Wayan, in Bali. He clearly takes great pride in the business that he runs, and it shows.Although we quit early on the 3rd day due to being over tired from our Mt. Batur trek the previous one, this is the itinerary we originally decided on with Wayan:Day 1- Tegalang rice paddy fields- kintamani to see Mt batur and lake batur- Tirta empul temple- tegenungan waterfall- monkey forestDay 2. July 20th pick up 3AM? Royal Kamuela Ubud, Jl Monkey forest Itinerary: -sunrise trek of mount Batur, -hot springs -bebek bengil, UbudDay 3.

Our final day we asked Wayan to take us to a local warung to get some Babi Guling (Indonesian Suckling Pig - which is basically their national dish) and he took us to a wonderful place, away from the tourist traps and it was a remarkable experience. Book a few days with Wayan, and I guarentee you will NOT be Disappointed!"

We emailed Bali Ari tours to set up a driver to take us from Seminyak to our hotel in Ubud. We were nervous because we waited till the day before we were set to leave to schedule the pick up. However, Waylan and his team took care of us.Our Driver Made (pronounced \"Mah-Day) picked us up in what we call in the States a Mini-Van. The van was clean and the A/C was cranking.Made was very nice, assertive & personable. Spoke good english and never got annoyed with all my questions about Bali and local life.We liked Made so much that we arranged for a private Day tour the next day. $50 US, Made picked us up around 9AM and we were off. We went to the Rice Paddy fields, the coffee plantations. (Try the \"Cat-Pooh-chino\") We then went to three great temples. had lunch that looked out to the volcano. ( You buy your driver lunch, $7 and its an all you can eat Balinese buffet. Not the greatest food in Bali but certainly not terrible especially for $7.) We needed our tour at the Monkey Temple. Now for my wife and i this was not our favorite. The monkey's are monkey's after all and this place is full of people running around taunting the monkey's and so forth. It's funny to watch as people buy bananas and feed the monkey's. The monkey's will crawl on your shoulder and sit there eating away. The monkey's don't like it when you smile at them so watch out. Overall the monkey temple was the most touristy thing we did in Bali. The sites were great, but what really made this tour for us, was our guide. I'm telling you if you can, request Made. He is very soft spoken, but once you get him talking he is so funny and knowledgeable, We requested Made again to take us to Jimbaran. Along the way we had him take us to the Bali Zoo because my wife wanted to feed an Elephant. Then he took us to the Tanah Lot temple. We arranged for Made to pick us up one last time to take us to the airport. It made for a great ending to a great trip.The point is, Bali Ari tours & our driver made our trip so much more amazing. It made things very easy to get around and learn the lay of the land. I honestly don't think we would have seen/experienced half of what we did if it were not for Bali Ari tours.Thank you Waylan for providing such a great service at a fair price.Made, thank you so much for putting up with all my questions and for having a great sense of humor. Also thank you for the Indonesian Flag! BTW, I mentioned to Made that my Father collects flags and that we could not find a Indonesian Flag to bring back for my dad. The next day Made picked us up, he had a flag for my dad. That's the kind of service Im talking about when I say Bali Ari tours is fantastic."

I was going to do a half day then changed my mind and Wayan was immediately accommodating. I had a great day out to Denpasar and Ubud, and Wayan's recommendation for the fish restaurant for lunch was excellent. I can't recommend this company highly enough for your Bali tour needs and will be using them again."

Mr. Wayan (the owner of the company) is very prompt in replying our emails and gave us suggestions on the itinerary as well. We would use Bali Ari tour again if we go back to Bali. Thank you very much for leaving us with nice memories."

Email correspondence was prompt. Prices were really cheap. He adjusts the tour depending on our preference and given time. Good idea to hire him for a half day tour instead of hiring a taxi from seminyak to ubud for 300,000 IDR. Best part of our tour was the goat sate and gule kambing otw to ubud. "

            "review": "Fantastic and Accommodating!. We were picked up by the owner of the company, Wayan. He had a comfortably sized (probably large for Bali) minivan that he took us everywhere on. Wayan was exactly on time and knew exactly where to pick us up. There are no street numbers on any of the stores, restaurants, or hotels that lined our street but Wayan knew where we were located. We had originally told Wayan that it would just be us, but we made a friend while checking out the other parts of Bali and invited him to come along on our tour. Wayan was very accommodating and took the change in plans in stride. Wayan took us all over Bali and showed us various temples, waterfalls, and rice terraces the first day. He even took us to a beautiful waterfall that we had all to ourselves. It was amazing. The second day, we invited another couple that we had met in Ubud and again, Wayan was very accommodating and gracious. On the second day, he picked us up at 3 am and we hiked Mt. Batur to catch the sunrise. Afterwards, we checked out another temple and then he took us to his favorite Babi Guling place! It was delicious. His English is very good despite being self taught. He was very knowledgable of all of the sites and some of the history behind most of them. He knew all the places to buy things at and will be able to tell you if something is a good deal or not. He even tried to find us a mortar and pestle a day after we had our tour with him on his own time. Wayan is a truly kind person that my wife and I are grateful that we met. Highly recommended and you won't be disappointed."

We agreed upon an itinerary through exchange of emails. Wayan replied fast and even suggested tourists' destinations that we could passed by on the way. He picked us up in the airport and drove us to Tanah Lot to Taman Ayun to Bedugul to Jatiluwih to Ubud. He even suggested cheap food stalls (very delicious gulai kambin=must try) where we can eat. He dropped us to our hotel doorstep at the end of the day. He is such a good and accomodating driver who goes out of his way to please his customers. He assists you in every possible way he can. The best part is, his rates are very reasonable and one of the best in the market. Such a passionate local. We found a new friend in Bali. Thanks Wayan for the tour Recommended and very trustworthy!"

Spent 2 days touring with these guys....The first days Wayan (owner) picked us up from Chedi Club and we basically saw most of what was to be seen North of Denpasar. Monkey kingdom, tiered rice paddies, volcanoes, waterfall. He was great. The car was clean.We were supposed to tour another day with Wayan but I messed up my scheduling. I called him the morning we were supposed to tour to either cancel or change the tour dates. He was understanding but said that he couldnt do the tour with us the next day we were looking to tour. He was upset about it. Still, he said he would send a co-worker to do the tour. So we met another Wayan (the owner's cousin) and did the tour with him. Again, great job touring and dropped us off at our second hotel destination in Bali.Id recommend."

            "review": "Honest, Outgoing, Knowledgeable Tour Guide In A Foreign Place. Now aren't these the words that you are looking for as a visitor looking for a tour guide and driver in a foreign country you've never been to? My husband and I went to Bali mid to end of May 2015 for our belated honeymoon from Southern California.Trip Advisor has drivers a plenty and good reviews galore but Bali Ari Tours is the best selection we could have made! The two days we scheduled tours with Wayan were nothing short of fantastic on all fronts-- service, value, quality, enjoyment. We liked him so much that we even asked him to drive us one last time to the airport at the end of our trip!We reached out to Wayan via Trip Advisor before our trip and sent him a short blurb about what activities and sites we were interested in and the 2 dates we wanted to do these activities. Being a type A personality, it was important that I do and see exactly what I wanted in the order I felt was logical for each day. Wayan was extremely accommodating, not to mention his prices were ridiculously good (8-10 hours of services is $50 USD and anything beyond that at $5/hr additional rate)!I've got only positive things to say about Wayan and his company but to break it down here are some of the reasons why I'd recommend any foreigner visiting Bali to pick his company:- Wayan is fluent in English. He is so fluent he will even crack jokes with you and even engage in some playful banter. When you're spending the entire day with a random stranger driving all over the island, this is a definite plus! What's surprising is that he is self taught fluent English speaker-- incredible!- Wayan is very thorough about following up to solidify daily schedules, including meeting time and location, and giving any miscellaneous information like projected entrance fee costs prior to the scheduled tour day. AND he is PROMPT--shows up either on time or a little earlier and that's super important when you don't have data service on your phone and your previously planned meeting place and time are all you've got to go on!-Wayan is charismatic and cheerful regardless of how tired he may be from the long day you've endured and will to the end accommodate your wants and needs. He is fun to be around and hanging out with him all day isn't awkward because he makes it a point to be your friend. - He is very easy-going, good-natured, and generously hospitable to all. We booked 2 different days with him and on each day we brought unexpected guests, fellow travelers we met along the way during our trip, and he was just as hospitable and accommodating to them as well!- He doesn't drive like a crazy maniac like the rest of Bali drivers. I get extremely carsick and his driving didn't make me sick. There are some bumpy, pot-hole ridden roads on the way to some of the places but he was very attentive about providing us with the smoothest ride possible. He also doesn't drive like many of the crazy drivers in Bali who swerve from their lane to the oncoming traffic lane!- He is physically fit and can lead you on any lengthy hike, regardless of difficulty. He is not one to just take you to a viewing point for a waterfall because it's too hard for him to lead the way directly to the bast of the fall! Wayan knows all the good hikes because he does a bunch of them with many of his clients and he'll even make sure you're fed along the way (we picked up some delicious copper bananas, mangosteens, and passion fruit to snack on! He'll make sure you get the local's price too!) - Lastly, he is HONEST. He will not try and pull a fast one over you or take you on some long winded tour just to get more money out of you. On our second day we ended up going 12+ hours and he still asked us for only $50. Of course we gave him more just because of his honesty and generosity!My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our tours with Wayan. He was an outstanding tour guide and driver and I would recommend him (and actually already have to 2 other groups I've learned are planning a trip to Bali) to any of my friends! Even the friends who joined us on our tours unplanned are recommending him to their friends and coworkers."

Hi, i have just returned home from my Bali holiday with 2 of my friends in which we decided to go through this company for our ubud day trip adventures and i just had to provide a review from the service we received from Wayan B.Firstly i was going through TripAdvisor to seek reviews and came across Wayan and decided to email him what our plans were and see if he was available. Firstly his promptness and professionalism was outstanding he responded to ask my emails within 5 minutes which fast response and high customer focus can be rare to find but Wayan ticked all boxes. He catered to our needs and met us to start our adventure we went to Bali zoo, waterfall, paddy fields & tanah lot though the tour didn't stop there. Throughout our 12 hour day Wayan was very informative and told us many stories about the villages, culture etc which was a great bonus also. Not only was he prompt, informative & polite he went out of his way to ensure customer satisfaction was met and even arranged or airport drop off for us aswell which he picked us up from ubud dropped us off in seminyak for dinner waited for us and took us to the airport. Honestly i highly rate Wayan to anyone bedding a personal driver in Bali! Thank you again Wayan. From; Rebecca, Rosetta & Danielle. =)"

His prices are cheaper than the guys shouting \"taxi, taxi\", his car is nicer than the guys who are haggling you on a couple thousand Rupiah, and he is the most helpful and friendly guy you will meet on your trip. We booked Wayan for a full day - pick up from the hotel in Ubud, a day sightseeing around as we made our way south, stopped whenever we asked so that we could change our 1 year-old's nappy, dropped us off for lunch at a restaurant we had chosen, took us to a spa so that my wife could have a massage, and dropped us off at the airport for our midnight flight back to Tokyo. Biggest regret: we didn't book Wayan up for our ride up to Ubud on our first day. Thank you Wayan, and we will see you next time we are in Bali."

Its been so for the past many years, and i've encountered numerous travel agencies and drivers claiming alot. It was in september 2014 when i had a chance to contact Ari on an extremely short notice as i had trouble with the driver my previous agency set me up with. I was really thankful that on a less than 24 hour notice Ari set us up with his buddy Wayan who was such a pleasure to meet and took us around to all the places we wanted to see, even gave us many recommendations and went out of his way to let us witness a Balinese Cremation Ceremony on our way to Lovina Beach from Ubud. It was my bad that i had a bad injury at Gitgit waterfall and Wayan was extremely helpful, he even came down all the way to help me up. On a whole, i find Ari and Wayan's travel really cost friendly, they have very good fixed prices and you can be sure you wont get cheated along the way. And they have been so helpful to me and i had an extremely good time in bali.I've recommended them both to numerous friends and family of mine.Just today my mum has returned from Bali and Ari had taken them around on a tour. They had such a fabulous time and really enjoyed it. I have a group of friends going down in sum weeks, who have also contacted Ari to bring them around,All in all, amazing, affordable, friendly, humble, hospitable!!

He did offer a free whole day tour as a way to make amends but I lost my trust and I no longer wanted to work with them further.

My family and i highly recommend booking with this tour company (especially Orba!). Thank you for the wonderful time!"

Emails were answered promptly and the arrangements were easy to make with Wayan.The driver Made Sudiarsa collected my at the hotel and drove me to the ARMA museum. It's an amazing place and I spent 2 hours in the museum and gardens. Coffee included. I was then taken to Ubud, as I had arranged. The driver spoke excellent English and I was able to find out many things about Bali from him. I spent several hours in Ubud, then was met exactly on time. I would thoroughly recommend this company."

After we finished each location, we saw loads of tour busses and groups showing up. Trip:- Tirta Empul Holy Water Temple, Pura Ulun Danu Temple (Lake Bratan), Jatiluwih Rice Fields, and Tanah Lot Temple for sunset. For lunch, I asked for a really local place instead of some tourist/western restaurant and he definitely gave us the hole-in-the-wall experience. Definitely what I was looking for.Service:- He was very prompt with emails prior to our arrival. Showed up on time the day of. Funny guy and kept things lively for us the entire day. We went back and forth a few times before finalizing our 10 hr schedule and he was helpful every part of the way.Vehicle:- Clean. Runs well and good air con. No issues whatsoever.We ended up seeing everything in less time that expected so Wayan asked if we wanted to do something else. Seems like he felt bad he didn't give us the full estimated time. What a good guy!I'd recommend Wayan without hesitation."

Unfortunately our experience was not good. We asked for a day trip and got quickly an answer, but unfortunately the official driver (I guess also the owner) was sick and mentioned that we would be served by another driver. We were travelling with a Baby and asked if they could provided a baby chair, what they confirmed.In the day of the trip, everything went fine, but the baby chair was not properly fixed, what made my us quite uncomfortable, to keep it in the right position with the hand. In the middle of the trip we saw some ants in the car and found strange, but still manageable. When we were returning, around 7pm from Ubud to Nusa Dua, my wife noticed that THE ANTS WERE COMING OUT FROM THE BABY CHAIR! And as this was night, the number increased a lot, with more than 20 around the car.We decided to stop the journey and stayed in UBUD for the night, to avoid that my baby got an ant bite. Obviously that was not in the plan, make us without backup clothes and also running to find a hotel at reasonable price. In the next day, we decided to take another company, as we were not happy with the service, and did not get any communication from Ari Tours."

As a single, female traveller, safety was a huge concern. Wayan was punctual, reliable and so insightful to the Balinese culture and all of their traditions. One of the days, Wayan was unavailable so he sent his cousin (also named Wayan) instead. His cousin was equally delightful. If you are looking for a reliable, worry free driver and guide, Wayan is by far the best money can buy."

The cab was a comfortable SUV and we were offered wet hand towels as complementary. We ran out of IDR and Wayan was very helpful in lending us his money and accepted return payment in dollars at the end of the trip. He also took us to an authentic Indonesian restaurant on my request. We forgot an important souvenir in his cab and he was kind enough to keep it safe for close to 10 months till a friend of mine visited Bali. I would strongly recommend planning at least a part of your trip to Bali on your own and book Wayan for it. The driver from an agency who accompanied us for the rest of the trip that was planned by an tour agent was a bit dull."

Wayan went out of his way to find one for me and dropped it off to me at my hotel the next morning after the tour!

Before that, I wrote a number of companies, which also offered cheaper price for day tour trips , but us I needed to make reservation fast I booked the first offer which responded on my request fastest. (50 $ / 1 day/ 8-10 hours). Included: Petrol, Driver fee, Parking fee. We have to cover the rest (entrance, eating, etc. which is understandable). The car was almost new, clean, with air conditioner. The first day of our trip was driver Wayan SUARDANE: He arrived on time; was polite, poor English (but it wasn't so important for us) - In my opinion driver thinks tourists are fools, because on vocation they do not follow up their expenses and therefore he is allowed to rob them. Robbery System - driver tells you one price of entrance (including parking fee, which he doesn't mention, let us to pay it and thinks we didn't see it). The parking fee usually is in light green color (aprox.5000 IDR, sometimes 15 000 IDR).OK ... for the first time when he did it, I thought for the sake of peace I do not want to spoil our trip and didn't tell anything to him. But he repeated the same \"moves\" 3 times. I could not stand it anymore - I reminded him that the parking fee is included in the price of the service. He played that he does not hear me (but didn't looked surprised). I showed a printout of approval - he began to stammer something. Since we had last temple to visit, I subtracted the difference from the tickets price the amount (which the driver wanted to steal from us) off, and let him to pay the difference. There is no longer question about the size of the amount (which he wanted to stole), but about the principle and the agreement which was not followed, and this situation left me a bitter taste of travel, as well forms my overall opinion about Balinese people too.The second day we had driver NYOMAN ORBA. He spoke very good English and taking into account the situation of the first day - he was cautious, diligent and helpful. We left a tip.So, please be careful! p.s.I apologize for spelling errors (English - my fourth foreign language)."

We paid us $55/$60 a day plus gave very generous tips and paid for snacks and food during the three days we used him. The going rate for a driver in Bali is about $50. Today he no showed claiming confusion. We hired a normal taxi driver for less money, more information and a very pleasant day.

It would have been better had the total expected cost been made clearer to us in advance, eg 15K per temple each, \"entry\" to Kintamani area plus 100K each (plus plus) for lunch - and we were apparently expected to pay for our guide's lunch as well. There were unexpected \"donations\" at many points of the rice paddy fields (which I would have no problem with if I believed they were going towards supporting all rice farmers in the area and shoring up the paddies rather than one or two lucky ones who have set up shop on the tourist path). Overall satisfactory but knowing a more exact figure in advance and having a driver who was a little bit more forthcoming with information would be useful improvements."

We visited 20 amazing sites, including several temples, Jatiluwih rice terraces, Bratan lake and twin lakes, Kebun Eka Raya Botanical Gardens, Munduk waterfall, and Tirta Gangga. His English is flawless, and he knows all of the best places to visit. Wayan is incredibly kind, knowledgeable, and patient! He is such a nice person and has a very positive, accepting view of the world. He also made our tour personalized to meet every one of our needs. We really enjoyed learning about Balinese culture and hearing about Wayan's family. Our time with Wayan was truly the highlight of our trip to Bali!"

Wayan, the owner of the business, was extremely prompt and helpful with my enquiries, so I had no hesitation in booking him to transport our family group of 7 people in one of his comfortable air-conditioned vehicles.Despite having agreed trip durations and destinations in advance, on each of the tours we asked for changes, which were very readily agreed to, so this flexibility was much appreciated. One of the changes tended to be to delete a temple visit, as it is very easy to be 'templed out', as one of my grandsons put it.Our first 2 trips were from Ubud, while the others were from Sanur, including a transfer back to the airport in 2 cars, to accommodate all of our luggage. The car arrived on time for each trip, apart from the second one, when Wayan himself was not well, so he had to organise another driver (Maddy) at the last minute, causing a delay of only 15 minutes - very good in the circumstances.I have no hesitation in recommending this company to you for interesting, informative, and reasonably priced tours."

Tours can be catered for individual needs and was even able take us to a temple when the traffic was bad at the one we originally arranged to visit. When we were at the temple he was able to give a breakdown of the meaning of the structures and its significance so we went just looking at the temple but understanding it. He had a good sense of space and lets you explore areas at your own pace but will help you explore an areaHis English is extremely good and has no problem understanding it either and will communicate with locals for purchasing items if needed. The car is very comfortable with plenty of leg space and air conditioning for people who do not like the warm. He also arranged for us to try some local food in Ubud that was delicious, there was a range of pork based choices but I specifically had a spicy soup that had diced pork and banana tree pulp in it and a range of pork including a spicy sausage and crackling, it was soooooo nice I could of eaten it all day \uf04aI can\u2019t thank Wayan enough for such a wonderful time and I would highly recommend him and this company to anyone who wants a tour to explore the area"

We ended up asking them to collect us from our villa in Seminyak and transport us to our hotel in Ubud the day before our tour as it was much cheaper than the hotel price for a transfer. It also meant we could take a more scenic route via Sanur and stop for lunch along the way. We were greeted outside our villa punctually by Nyoman Orba and instantly i knew we were in good hands. He explained about the Bali culture and the trades each area/village are known for along the way and even suggested a place to stop for lunch. For our day tour we visited 6 difference sites and each time Orba answered all our questions and explained about the history of the sites. He was always friendly, professional and it was our pleasure to be guided by him. We really like the way he made sure we didn't over pay at any of the sites and even lent us his wife's sarong!We had no hesitation in asking Orba to drive us for our transfer to Gili T after our final night in Ubud and it was sad to see him leave.

For example for dolphin tour, boat guy initially asked us IDR 700000 and driver didn't tell us what the right price should be. We finally took the boat at IDR 200000 based on our own research.

On our first full day, we took a trip to visit a local wood carver. Our villa had a driver on staff, but since there were 8 of us going, we needed a second driver. We had the good fortune of going with Wayan Balik, and this stroke of luck changed our entire trip for the better.  It was immediately apparent that Wayan B. was the better choice, when at first he was following the Villa's driver, and then took a different turn in Ubud. I remarked \"Isn't that our group?\" He answered, \"This is a shortcut!\" Well, He was certainly right, he not only got us to our destination 10 minutes before the other group arrived, but along the way he was happy to share insights into Indonesian Politics as well as Balinese Culture. Wayan was no ordinary Driver. We made plans to go on a tour of Ubud with Wayan B. for the next day, and it was an amazing experience. Wayan took the time to explain the sights we visited and take us wherever we wanted to go, all the while educating us and entertaining us. Soon, word got out about Wayan, and everyone staying at our villa began to request him as their driver throughout the week. At the end of the day, everyone was glad that they toured with Wayan, all of us regaling each other with their adventures. Wayan was also able to set us up with a snorkeling adventure to Nusa Lembongan, and this trip was the highlight of everyone's week. We ended up paying $60US which included transport from Ubud to Sanur Harbor, Fast Boat to Nusa Lembongan, being met in Nusa Lembongan by our guide and a four hour snorkeling adventure by boat to 4 awesome snorkeling sights. ASK WAYAN ABOUT SNORKELING, HE WILL SET IT UP Wayan drove us to Amed from Ubud some 3 hours away and stopped at a secluded beach to have a drink and enjoy the afternoon, a most pleasant detour. He is available to pick up from the airport and all over Bali, email or call him and he will take good care of you. Wayan Balik was the best driver and guide we had during our trip. He was always early and made sure we were having a good time. He was an all around great guy, and I can't say enough about his services and about him as a gentleman. He even called me on our last morning in Bali to say farewell and to thank me for hiring him. I can honestly say that our trip would not have been as good if Wayan hadn't been a part of it.On a side note: The coffee that was served at our villa was excellent and everyone loved it. During our first excursion, someone in our car remarked, \"I just can't wait for tomorrow morning, so I can have some more of that coffee!\" Wayan B. heard this and asked \"You liked the Coffee?\" All of us in the car gave a resounding YES! Wayan smiled, and told us that the coffee we were all so impressed with was his family's coffee. Wayan's family has been roasting coffee for generations, and he told us the secret was the wood roasting process. He offered to bring some by before we left, and everyone staying at our villa brought some home. We brought back 5 kilos of the wonderful beans, and have had some every morning since our return home. I'm not sure what we'll do when we run out!!! BUY COFFEE FROM WAYAN B. YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!!!!!!"

It was very easy to communicate via emails. Our drivers spoke good english and told us many interesting facts about Bali, local people and traditions. And all that for very reasonable prices! 100% recommended to use their service!"

So figured i would write my review.We hired bali air as our driver to go see sites one day and another day just to take us to potato head for day.Setting up the days itinerary we did over back and forth emails with wayan b. It was very easy, convenient and quick and wayan always responded quickly. Wayan was on time for our pickup and drove us around to the volcano, temples and other things we had discussed. His knowledge and english was great. it was nice being able to ask questions and converse during our drive. Both wayan B. and S. were very friendly, knowledgeable and safe drivers. We never felt unsafe on those tiny roads even with all the motorbikes scooting around every which way lol.Wayan s. Did our driving to potato head and he arrived early and picked us up right away when we were ready to leave. We enjoyed their driving and friendliness we arranged for them to transport us from one hotel to another with a stop at tannah lot on the way. Hopefully we can get back to bali to see so much more that we want to see and if so i would definately want the wayan's to be our driver again! Highly recommended and if anyone has any questions feel free to contact me on pm here. Thank you wayan and wayan!"

He took us to every sight on our list, and a few extras like the agro-tourism (where we tried, and liked, Kopi Luwak!) and to see the volcano. He was very patient when my boyfriend needed extra time for photography, which was most of the time. Wayan S spoke very good English and was willing to answer our questions about Bali life and customs. We liked him so much we booked a second day, during which traffic was unbelievable but Wayan S still managed to get us to all of our preferred sights. We booked him on the day we were moving from Sanur to Canggu, and he loaded all of our luggage in the car and waited for us to watch sunset at Tanah lot before he dropped us off at the new place. Cannot recommend highly enough! Wayan B followed up afterwards and we let him know how much we liked Wayan S."

After reading through reviews on TripAdvisor, I emailed a few tour companies who had good reviews here. Mr. Wayan Balik (Wayan B.) was quick to respond to my emails and confirmed that one among their three guides/drivers would take us to Bedugul. Mr. Wayan Suardane (Wayan S.) was our private tour guide for our day trip to Bedugul. He arrived at our hotel promptly at 9AM, as discussed over email. The Toyota Avanza that Wayan S. drove looked new and clean. As soon as our journey started, we knew we were in safe hands. Within five minutes of our journey, I requested Wayan if he could take us for a full-day tour to Kintamani, the next day, as we were already impressed by his good nature and driving skills. Wayan agreed and informed us that he was available to take us to Kintamani. Wayan asked us where we wanted to go and suggested an itinerary. He was flexible and changed the plan according to the weather conditions, to ensure we were at the right place at the right time.During our day-trip to Bedugul, Wayan took us to Taman Ayun temple at Mengwi, Ulun Danu temple at Lake Bratan, Bali botanical gardens, Jatiluwih Rice terraces and Tanah Lot Temple. At each of these attractions, we took a lot of photos and Wayan was patient until we were ready to go. We informed Wayan that we were vegetarians and he brought us to Jatiluwih 259 (restaurant) which had good vegetarian options and also a good view of the rice terraces while having lunch. On our second day trip to Kintamani, Wayan took us to Pulu Mujung Warung (restaurant) which served good organic vegetarian food, with a view of the Kintamani volcano and Lake Batur. Wayan S. provided us with lots of tips, such as do's and don'ts, for vacationing in Bali and also helped us avoid unnecessary expenses (such as renting sarongs from hawkers outside Gunung Kawi temple, when free sarongs are provided by the temple on purchasing the ticket). He also has an excellent understanding of the history of Bali as well as on Hinduism. Being a Hindu myself, I found all his statements to be factually accurate. He spoke English very well and had a good sense of humor. His driving skills were good and safe as he had been driving for nearly 20 years. Throughout our trip, we spoke to Wayan about different topics and we learnt a lot about Balinese culture.At the end of our two full-day tours to Bedugul and Kintamani, we were sad to bid farewell to our good friend Wayan S.. Our Bali trip was made memorable due to our time with Wayan S. and his rich knowledge of the different tourist attractions of Bali. The owner, Wayan B. also emailed me after our day tours to inquire how our two days were. I would give full marks to Bali Ari tours for their customer service as they really care about their customers and do not do business just for money. I would highly recommend Bali Ari tours to my friends and would have no qualms in utilizing their services whenever I visit Bali again. Thank you Bali Ari Tours!"

We booked Mr Wayan Suardana for the airport pick-up as well as two full days of touring in Bali, and were more than satisfied with the service and company he provided along the journey. Wayan S' command of English was good and so we delved into topics about Balinese culture, tradition and development in varying depths and lengths in the two full days he drove us around. He was always very punctual and was proactive in helping us, such as coordinating the shuttle pick-up from our villa in Ubud. He also was flexible in accommodating to our plans and requests, such as stopping by to get a local SIM card. At the different scenic spots, he would either guide us through the exhibits and explain the artifacts or leave you to explore the sights and take them in at your own pace - he never did rush us or signal that he was impatient.Wayan S was certainly a significant part of why our Bali trip went so well, and his willingness to share with us snippets of Balinese life and norms made this trip more than just a stop-and-see tour of the usual sights. We highly recommend Bali Ari :)"

A last minute decision to go to Ubud for a day, led us to search Trip Advisor for a good guide who could take 3 girls on a safe, comfortable and guided tour of Ubud. We were looking for someone who could pick us up and drop us back to our hotel in Seminyak. I called Wayan\u2019s number at 9:30pm the night before and he answered straight away. Wayan spoke great English and the booking was easily arranged for the next day over the phone. By chance this also fell on a Public Holiday in Bali and Wayan kindly agreed to take us on a tour instead of having a day off! The next day Wayan arrived to our hotel right on time and collected us in an air-conditioned van (with complimentary water) and we started our trip to Ubud. Wayan suggested some of the top spots to visit and was more than happy to accommodate our request to visit some silver jewellery shops on the way to Ubud.Wayan was such a great guide, he took us to all of the essential spots and guided us through the temples, explaining the history and customs. We also told Wayan that we would love to try the babi guling (slow roasted suckling pig) for lunch, which is famous in Ubud. Wayan took us to a great local place serving this delicacy and we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience eating locally rather than eating at a tourist place in town. It was a great day, and I can highly recommend Bali Ari Private Tours and Driver to anyone who wants a flexible, hassle free, safe and extremely reasonably priced tour or driver. Thanks again Wayan for a great day!"

It was our first time in Bali and we knew we wanted to see the cultural side of Bali but wasn't sure exactly where to go. I contacted a few drivers with good reviews on Tripadvisor and Wayan from Bali Ari Private Tours & Driver was the first to reply within hours of emailing him.I mentioned a few places we wanted visit and Wayan Balik (owner of the company) quickly suggested a schedule for 4 days plus a transfer from the airport to the hotel. His English was very good and he replied promptly after every email (probably faster than I did). Unfortunately, he wasn't available for the dates we wanted but he arranged for his friend Wayan Suardana to take us around. I was first a little concerned about having a different driver but Wayan B assured that he was just as good, and he couldn't have been more correct. Wayan S was great; he was punctual, didn't complain one bit when we were late or when we made his trek up loads of stairs (in fact he may have been fitter than both of us), his English was very good, his he drove very safely and knew all the right ways to get to places. He dropped us off at reliable money changers and in the centre of Ubud instead of the hotel as we requested. The car was relatively new and very clean. Their prices were very reasonable; Wayan only joined us for lunch when we asked and he was always careful of ordering food which wasn't expensive.We wouldn't have been able to fit in everything we wanted to do without their help. I know we will be contacting them the next time we're in Bali (of course already thinking of going back because we had such a lovely time with them!) I would definitely recommend their services to everyone."

He is a fabulous, knowledgeable driver with a warm, engaging personality. He has a great sense of humour and quickly struck up a rapport with all five of us, including our elderly parents. Wayan's knowledge of Bali is quite vast, from its culture and economy to his personal observations of village life. We had a fairly obscure destination to locate in quite a remote area and Wayan negotiated some of the more challenging rural roads in good humour all the way. We intend to return to Bali again in 2015 and know that we will be lining up Wayan well in advance. I'm so happy we met Wayan"

            "review": "8 reasons to choose this guy.. The very first visit to Bali was made an immense success full of highlights, primarily thanks to the unforgettable assistance offered by this ultra-reliable tour-driver. Responsiveness:Before heading for Bali, I searched TripAdvisor thoroughly and mailed 3 top-ranking tour drivers. Wayan was the first to respond and answered my questions in detail. A nice beginning. We very quickly agreed on the rough schedule and he suggested me making adjustments into it after arrival which turned out to be great piece of advice. Timeliness: In my 5-day escorted tour, Wayan appeared on time (and most often earlier) in front of my hotel and drove me to everywhere my whim called to my mind. On some days my tour exceeded 9 hours, and he didn\u2019t show the tiniest iota of impatience. Thanks a million, buddy!Cleanliness:He\u2019s got two well-maintained cars, each capable of seating 5-7 persons. The car is so clean and the air-con works without a hitch. I took the black car some days, and also the silver one on others. Local knowledge:Wayan was born in a local village (renowned for paintings, how very nice!) and thus knows almost everything about Bali. Under his guidance, I adjusted my schedule so as to make the most of my time for Muay Thai Boxing, Yoga, Bicycle Tour, Spa, and a lot more activities. Since Bali is a vast island (it truly is, much bigger than you may have thought), you definitely need a private tour to yourself during your stay, unless you want to spend much of your time in your hotel. Insider Tips:I learned a lot from him about Bali, as to her history, population, geography, culture, sights to see, where to see the best Rice Paddy Fields (the Bali Hai Bicycle Tour that he recommended to me was so UNFORGETTABLE!!! It was a 3-hour ride on bicycle through Bali\u2019s best-kept terrains. You will ride through many divine-looking terrains most of which is DOWN-HILL!!! And you will see temples, farmlands, palm trees, an eyeful of trees, flowers and rice paddy fields, lotus ponds, prettily curved mountain tracks, bamboo jungle as well!!!). Thank you \u2013 Wayan, without your help I would not be able to do so many activities within 5 days!!!Great price-performance ratio:Like many other users of TripAdvisor, I was thinking about whether I should have a private tour driver to myself for the trip. It turned out that it is HUGELY necessary. Keep in mind that in the vast land of Bali, Kuta is the only place where you can get an empty taxi on the street. Which means in every other part, you have to call the Blue Bird taxi company to have a car driver reach you. It may take 30-40 minutes. If you plan to visit more than 3 different places, then spending USD 50 per day to have such a great tour driver like Wayan is the best deal to clinch, as I quickly learned of. Very nice temperament: At the age of 39 years and also being a father of two sons, Wayan is not only reliable, amicable, but also knowledgeable and understanding (which is very important for a tour guide). He never shows a sign of impatience throughout my trip from beginning to finish. He always tries to offer a hand to help you schedule your time smartly and more efficiently. This Baliese man is an epitome of great hospitality, oozing warmth and natural friendless, to be fair. His reinforcements:Wayan has friends who also do the tour driving. In one of my days in Bali, he had to attend a wedding ceremony of his cousin. He politely informed me of this and told me another driver would take good care of me like he did. As it turned out, the other driver (being his relative) is a very kind man who also speaks good English as Wayan does. The communications, helpfulness and pleasantness are equally impressive. So do not worry, Wayan is able to cope with your varying needs to the utmost. If I visit Bali again, I will book him again for the whole stay."

As this is my 1st trip, I surf through the recommendation made by others in Tripadvisor. I read good reviews on Bali Ari Private Tours & Driver, so, I decided to hire Wayan as a driver for 1 way-airport transfer for both arrival & departure. On 11/9 & 12/9, we hire him for 2 full days. He is very polite and friendly. Throughout the journey, he explained to us the Balinese culture. My parents like him a lot too as he showed much respect for them. His driving skill is good and careful. In Bali, I do not recommend visitors to drive as there are many small roads, heavy trafffic and limited signboard. With him, we feel that we are in good hands. And, he is very punctual as well. He has 2 toyota cars. One is Kijang (7 seaters) and another one is Avanza. Both cars are rather new and clean. Just a small suggestion that perhaps some mineral waters could be provided on board. On 11/9, we managed to visit Tegalalang Rice Terraces, Coffee Plantations, Volcano Mt Batur, Berskih Temple and Water Temple (Pura Tirta Empul). And, on 12/9, we visited Elephant Cave, Kuta Beach, Padang Padang Beach, GWK, Uluwatu Temple and Jimbaran Beach (Dinner). It is quite intensive. But, we would like to see many things as much as possible. We would not be able to visit so many places without him. And, I have a request to go Nyang Nyang Beach. But, he never go before. But, he tried his best to go there and we are happy to give up as the road is too uneven and rocky. In fact, going Uluwatu will be good enough. The point is that he did his best to satisfy our wish list. I will certainly use him again for my next visit. And, I will recommend him to my friends as well."

I had found Wayan on TA and contacted him via email on the last minute request. He promptly responded within minutes confirming he was available. We exchanged a few more emails and each time he replied quickly. I also did not respond for a few hours on one reply from him and he followed up to make sure I had received it. He was on time for our appointment and spoke English well. Wayan was funny and kind and shared with me information on Balinese culture and local events. He was pleasant company to and from the Green School. I would look to hire him again as a driver should I find myself in Bali again."

From the get-go, Wayan was quick to respond to emails, and not only able to accommodate the different locations we had in mind, but also had suggested other locations in mind that he thought we might enjoy. More importantly, as another reviewer has mentioned, he does not take the piss with the price\u2014it was affordable and reasonable.As a guide, he is an extremely competent driver (try going down the massive bends on the way to Lovina; Wayan did it with ease and safety) and has an extensive knowledge of his country which he is very proud to share. From visiting the dolphins at 3 in the morning, visiting an active volcano, to recommending the best restaurants in Ubud, Wayan brought us around as one would bring a friend\u2014warmth, sincerity and a lot of laughter. He was also very reliable. I don't remember him ever being late (trust me, punctuality is a bit of a rare trait in Bali).We left Bali not only having experiencing a wonderful holiday\u2014much thanks to Wayan\u2014but also having made a new friend that we would highly recommend and call upon during our next visit!

Bali is pretty wild on the road, and we felt comfortable and safe with him at all times.-Sweet ride. He has a brand new Toyota Espanza which is very comfortable and clean. Can seat 7.-Wayan himself is just a great guy. He is always happy, genuine, and willing to help with anything. Great sense of humor as well.-Wayan's english is fantastic. No topic is off limit, and you talk about anything with him.-He is informative. He obviously does some research prior to your visits and is able to give you back ground info on places you want to go.-His rates are fantastic. We compared all of Bali's drivers and his rates were among the average/lowest.Bottom line is this: Wayan makes you feel like you are visiting an old friend, is a joy to be with, and is more than willing to show you his beautiful island. Amazing value for Bali's best driver."

Wayan is a calm, friendly presence to show you the main attractions of the island as well as to get you to places off the beaten track for hours of photo ops and blissful memories. The fact that his English is good is of course a plus point for many. And of course if you have specialised needs such as buying furniture or handicrafts, (among others) Wayan has insider knowledge about places/vendors not normally known to other guides/drivers or guidebooks. He is a great support for any whilrlwind trips of a couple of hours (or less) or even on adventures that may last a few days."

We left with a friend, someone who was always on time, friendly and proud of his island! I have referred people to Wayan since and hear nothing but great things upon return. The price is right, the company is good, oh....and ask him to take you to places he likes to eat and visit. He also hook us to Jimbaran for seafood and Uluwatu where we stayed the rest of our time!! Great guy, great driver, great service!!!!"

A friend in Sydney recommended Made Wirasa as a driver to me and I used his service 4 times in total during my week long stay in Bali. He was always prompt, reliable and a very friendly and engaging travel companion as he chauffeured me here and there. He has excellent English and as well as taking me where I wanted to go, he also made suggestions of places I might like to divert to and take in along the way - which was very helpful. He drove me from Seminyak to Ubud and then back again three days later - US $35 one way which is very reasonable as this is a 90 minute drive, possibly even more depending on traffic.I highly recommend Made Wirasa to anyone who is seeking a driver while in Bali - and as this is a family business I imagine the other drivers are equally personable and professional."

Everything very nice and stunning views.The attractions were great, but our driver was amazing. He gave us so much information about the culture, lifestyle and religion of balinese people. In addition, he was a very happy, talkable and positive person, who made every drive more comfortable and exiciting.Definitely worth it."

We do not normally do any excursions on any of our vacations but this year we have decided to do so much more. Well, our day was perfect from beginning to end.... Not one tiny bit could be faulted. We want to give the hugest thanks to Made Wirasa - an awesome man who made us feel welcome in his country, was extremely knowledgable (even when we asked some odd questions) and also taught us so much about the culture and history of Bali. Made was so incredibly flexible - even to the point of altering the trip to suit our needs (well the needs of a 19 year old young woman who had lost her belly bar and needed another). He was courteous, supportive when we were unsure about how things such as dress and etiquette in the temple, gave us space when we needed it but was always there when needed. He made us feel safe, welcome, and stimulated our interest even more and made everything we saw and experience come to life even more with his insight.Made, I want to thank you for an awesome day!!! Beverley, Heather, Louise and Joshua.Places visited included: Ubud town including Monkey Forest Road (very busy place); Ubud rice fields (need to be fairly fit to climb up and down!); Volcano - sadly raining so not the best view but still so very glad we went) with a lunch (typical Indonesian food); Coffee plantation (very informative and lovely to sit and drink coffee; and the temple where visitors are welcome to bathe in the temple waters - sarongs given for a donation at the entrance, and if you choose to bathe in the waters separate sarongs can be hired for a small charge.I would fully recommend this trip for a taste of Bali culture, and Made made it come to life."

He recommended and took us to fantastic places to eat, took us to the most famous temples, and while driving would tell us about the various sites we would drive past. He was always on time and very kind our our young children. He explained different aspects of Balinese customs and culture to us as well.

His English is very good. He is professional and patient. He provided us with a list of places to visit and let us decide which ones to visit.He picked us up from our hotel then took us to Ubud. We visited the wood carving centre, silver smith, the market, local temple, and had roasted pig for lunch. He then took us to the rice paddies, and a location of a wonderful view of the volcano. He also took us to a coffee plantation and had some nice teas and some \"poop-ccino\" coffee. Then we ended our activities with a visit to another bigger temple before he dropped us at our hotel.The trip is exactly as described as the web-page, maybe even better. We highly recommend \"Hire Bali Driver\" for their professional service."

We booked a private tour from \u2018Hire Bali Driver\u2019. We were greeted promptly at our reservation time by our driver, Wayan Suardika. He provided us with cold water and towels for our comfort. Before we even started our day trip, we asked him if we could \u2018personalize\u2019 our experience by adding and omitting activities to suit what we wanted to see. Without hesitation he listened to what we wanted to see and discover. With his extensive knowledge of the Island, we all agreed on an itinerary that would include high priority sights, without compromising our timeline. We spent the entire day seeing so many beautiful and interesting sights and landmarks. From jewelry and wood working shops to waterfalls, temples, and the Monkey forest, Wayan walked us through each stop with an insight unique to locals, which we appreciated. After the day concluded, we actually felt like we were traveling with an old friend discussing topics of music, religion, hobbies and culture. My wife and I decided to book a second tour with Wayan for a different day on another part of the Island. This too was another Hallmark experience.  Traveling to exotic places halfway around the world can be exciting and unsettling not knowing the language, currency or culture. Your trip will only be as good as the sum of your experiences there. Do not get stuck with a \u2018cab\u2019 driver who will not enhance your experience. You can hire just another \u2018driver\u2019 (there are plenty of them), but if you want to feel like you are welcome, included, and a part of what\u2019s happening, hire a friend. Hire Wayan Suardika from \u2018Hire Bali driver.\u2019 He is prompt, courteous, honest, knowledgeable, enjoys his work, speaks English very well and makes you feel comfortable during your visit.-Thanks Wayan!"

We went to Bali in October for 1 week, after visiting a few surrounding countries we thought it would be the perfect place to rest enjoy the beautiful beaches and culture it has to offer. I enquired with Wayan before we left about a day trip to Ubud as I thought it looked good. He arrived in good time, met us in the lobby of our hotel and we set off on the day. Our trip involved going through many different markets, at each location we were able to look at our own pace and when ready to leave Wayan was there with the car. After visiting the markets he took us to a beautiful waterfall, knew exactly which way we should go and which routes to take in order to keep the day running as smoothly as possible. After a trip to the waterfall a spot of lunch was in order! Wayan took us to the most beautiful rice field where we sat and had lunch in a little hut surrounded by water. It definitely made the difference having someone local show you around as we would never have found a place like that on our own! After the day was over I booked Wayan for a further 2 days, his knowledge of Bali and general manners were excellent. I have recommended Wayan to friends who are travelling to Bali and I will definitely be calling him again when I return! Thank you for making our trip so special"

We asked him about some things and since he did not know the answer he contacted friends and researched on the Internet so he would be knowledgeable and help us. Me loves his job and meeting new people. He will pick you up from the airport and transport you back as well. Wayan used to manage a resort many years ago and judging from our experience, we think it was likely well run. He is always early to pick up, ready and smiling. Nothing is a hassle or inconvenience for him. I know he will get lots of business from this review and we hope he only hires people of his same caliber."

I was travelling in Bali on my own and most viator tours had a minimum of two people per booking, however, this tour allowed single bookings too, so I went for it. The tour claimed to be flexible, so I was asked for a few changes which were done for me. Staff were very helpful and kind. I asked to be picked up from Ubud and dropped off in Nusa Dua to save on transfer fees, which they did for me for no charge. I also asked for the tour to start at 12pm instead of 9am. My driver, Wayan Suardika, was very kind and arrived promptly. I asked him many questions about Bali, which he kindly answered for me. He took me to a few great beaches, one from the movie Eat,Pray,Love before arriving at the beautiful Uluwatu temple. I didn't want to take part in the seafood dinner, since I am vegan, so we missed that out. He always gave me plenty of time to take pictures and never rushed me. The car was comfortable and air-conditioned. I highly recommend this tour, especially to those who like to mix and match and need flexibility."

We did 3 tours with him starting from ubud and go to the north, east and south. Wayan explained a lot of the culture and way of live in bali. He gave us helpful advices how to handle with the balinese people.Wayan himself is very gentle and speaks very good english. His car was always clean and well prepared. Wayan was everytime in time!! We booked him for 3 days each 10 hours. The price was in the middle range but for that offered service the best !! Thats why we take him 3 times...We wish all the best to Wayan and his family and partners.

After a google search and a few last minute emails we arranged a day tour with Hire Bali Driver. Wayan picked us up at 9am, we had already agreed a rough itinerary which can be tailored to your wishes, we started our day visiting traditional cloth makers and silversmiths, a beautiful temple and traditional Balinese painters. As requested Wayan took us for a delicious traditional suckling pig lunch. We then visited a holy spring temple which left us in awe, this was followed by a visit to a Kopi Luwak plantation which overlooked a rice terrace and ended the day being dropped off in an area near to our hotel full of fresh fish restaurants right on the beach. The entire day was full of culture, learning and stunning scenery. Wayan was very knowledgable and extremely accommodating - he went above and beyond to meet our needs. Absolutely the best day of our entire trip and incredible value for money. Thanks Wayan!"

We agreed to a cost of $50 for a 10 hour trip and agreed a pick up at the port. We disembarked at 8.15am and Wayan was waiting with a sign with our names, so it was really simple to meet him. We visited Ubud on the way to the Elephant safari which was nice. On arriving at the Elephant safari we realised everyone else there were from our ship and had paid $189 each just to this part of our day out, we paid $60 each at the park meaning if we had just done the safari alone we would have saved ourselves (4 of us) nearly $500. After a lovely time meeting and riding upon these wonderful creatures we decide we would relax on a beach, so Wayan took us to nesa dou beach which was very beautiful and more importantly very quiet. On the way there Wayan asked if we would like to see a beautiful sunset over the sea and a local traditional dance, we said we would love to, so after a few hours relaxing on this beautiful beach it was time to head off again. We arrived in plenty of time to take our seats in the amphitheater and enjoy the dancing and of course that beautiful sunset. On the way back Wayan was kind enough to offer us to visit his family for food but after a full 12 hour day we were very tired so had to decline unfortunately but what a very kind gesture and another time we would have loved to accepted. We had an amazing day and saw so much in one day that we decided that the following half day in Bali would be spent at the beach and of course we asked Wayan if he could drive us again which he agreed to. Needless to say there he was waiting the next morning to take us to our chosen destination. Wayan is such a lovely person and so polite and helpful that I would highly recommend his services, especially if like us you have a overnight stop, why pay the ships prices when you can book Hire Bali Driver......you be a fool not to"

They made various recommendations and planned according to the weather.4. The driver, Mr Nyoman, was on time and he shared his wealth of knowledge.Along the way, Mr Nyoman will alert me to the 'photo' opportunities. The rice terrace, the nice temples, the community halls. He explained the structure of a typical Balinese village.Our first stop was to the elephant safari. After lunch, we headed to a coffee plantation. Mr Nyoman accompanied us on a part of the tour of the plantation and he shared his knowledge on herbs and plants. Next, we went to the Monkey Forest. After a nice walk there, he sent us shopping in Ubud (which is a must -do, even if you do not want to shop). The sights, the art and crafts, the architecture in Ubud must be experienced on foot. For dinner, he brought us to the Bebek Bengil (Dirty Duck) which is on the list of any foodie pilgrim. As we 'exceeded' our time in Bebk Bengil, he drove us efficiently to the Kecak Fire Dance and we reached on time! Finally, when it is time to return to our accommodations, There was a huge traffic jam at Seminyak area (the main road apparently). Mr Nyoman, with his experience and knowledge of the small alleys, drove up back to our hotel in 10 min. Thank you, Mr Nyoman and Hire Bali Driver!"

On our way to Ubud, he had several options ready for me to choose.In the following two days, I asked him for advice on what to do as I wanted to go to local places rather than touristic ones. He gave me lots of options and we ended up going to a coffee plantation, temples, some viallages ceremonies (I wasbrhe only tourist There!). I loved it. He also made me feel very comfortable all the time.He is very easy to talk to. Ask him about religion in Indonesia, the culture... He will explain everything to you with a smile on his face.I know I will be back to Bali, and I know I will reach out to Dewa again :)Thanks a lot Dewa, I had an amazing time with you!!!"

Not to mention the view from our private gazebo was amazing (another tip from Dewa). During our drive Dewa answered all of our questions about Balinese culture and conversed with us about many topics. He entertained us with Balinese folklore after we purchased a wood carving with the Indonesian versions of Romeo and Juliet. He was kind and patient--we never felt rushed.

Dewa indicated that he was not available, but that Nyoman would be free to drive us to Ubud. At first I was a bit skeptical. I had read all of these great reviews about Dewa but I had not seen anything from Nyoman. Dewa insisted that Nyoman was a good driver and capable of handling our needs, so we moved forward.Nyoman picked us up from the Menjangan on time. The car was clean and in great shape. He was incredibly polite, and on the drive to Ubud we stopped at four or five different places to take in the local sites and cuisine. At the end of the first day Nyoman asked if we were comfortable using him for the following two days, or if we wanted Dewa to pick us up. We were comfortable with Nyoman so we asked him to drive us the next day.In the end we hired Nyoman for four straight days. He brought us all over the island. We saw over a dozen temples, went to shows, went shopping, and did a variety of other activities.I noticed many drivers waiting in the car while the people who hired them made their way through various attractions, not Nyoman. Nyoman personally walked us around everything and thoroughly explained what we were seeing, and where we should go. While we had a few ideas about what we wanted to see, Nyoman made many suggestions that really made our trip excellent. Nyoman was much more than a driver, he was a tour guide. His English was excellent, and his knowledge was superb. He is an all-around great guy who was quick to answer the hundreds of questions I asked him.Nyoman was even nice enough to accompany us through the pouring rain at times. He was always: on time, polite, eager to please, and quick to answer questions. If you are looking for a driver, hire anyone. If you are looking for a true, top of the line tour guide, hire Nyoman. I can\u2019t say enough about how knowledgeable he is, and how great of a guy he truly is."

He was very patient as I changed my itinerary a few times before the date of my tour and was able to find the most efficient route to fit it all in. One bonus was even getting to go shopping at a local store far from the tourism and buy some of the Balinese skirts I admired so much.I appreciated his flexibility and he was a very safe, courteous driver.I would use him again."

Before arriving in Bali I arranged for Dewa to take my wife and I and two other couples we were traveling with on an all day tour. Dewa arrived on time and prepared to take on the tour we had arranged via email. Our group decided we were not interested in the complete itinerary we had planned prior to our arrival. Dewa was very flexible, making changes as we requested and ensuring we saw and went to the best there was to offer for whatever our interests, including a very nice silver store, an elephant park, art galleries and wood carvers. Dewa was so great that although our hotel had transportation available to take us to Ubud and other local areas we instead called Dewa any time we knew that we wanted more than a simple drop off. Dewa even arranged for multiple vehicles to transport our group of 6 from Ubud to Seminyak for the second portion of our stay in Bali painlessly. After our arrival in Seminyak we quickly became dissatisfied with the transportation/service provided by our hotel, so I called Dewa. Dewa proceeded to drive over an hour from Ubud to take my wife and I on a final day of touring and to the airport for our departure. If you ever visit Ubud and are in need of transportation I strongly recommend that you utilize Dewa, he is much more affordable than hotel sponsored transportation and is just a joy to be around. "

We had a chat with Dewa and actually planned our next day tour during the ride from the airport to the resort!He picked us up on time and started the tour as planned. As the day progressed he realized one of us could not visit temples and he suggested other alternative places of interest on-the-go. The day tour was actually meant to be relaxing but when he realized we may be missing out on the places to visit in ubud because of our schedules he actually cramped more places for us to visit! During the tour he brought us to a nice silver and wood carving shop but that is after we have agreed to go. He did not hard sell or force us to go. We bought beautiful silver pieces and wood carving at reasonable prices and we're happy with our purchases.To be honest I think that day tour covers more than wat we would have seen on our 4 days in ubud haha. He was very knowledgeable and told us lots of stories and explained Balinese cultures, belief and their way of life. He also recommended and helped us to book a good and affordable massage place. All in all we spent a wonderful day with Dewa. Oh he was actually sick on the morning of our tour but he did not cancel our trip which we were very grateful of. Thank you Dewa"

I decided to do the East Bali tour including Tirta Gangga, White Sand Beach, Bat Cave Temple, Taman Kertha Gosa, and Goa Gajah. He even provided a sarong for the temples that required one so that I did not have to worry about purchasing one. The cost was a little higher than what you might find on the street but it was worth knowing this is someone you can trust. It was also nice having it prearranged and simply being picked up at my hotel."

What I have to say first, before I describe or explain anything else, is that this guy is absolutely recommendable.We decided quite spontaneously to make a guided tour around the\u00a0Ubud\u00a0area on the next day. We got in email contact via\u00a0Tripadvisor\u00a0with\u00a0Dewa\u00a0and asked if he could make us an offer for a guided tour. Within less\u00a0than\u00a0two hours, we had organized out of four optional tours he offers (whereas every tour sounded really interesting and worth to join), one with our specific wishes. We wanted to see temples, fruit and coffee plantains, rice fields and traditional\u00a0Balinese\u00a0lifestyle.\u00a0Dewa's tours are about from 9 am to 6 pm and cost about 50-60 US $, which is a really attractive price for that, what he offers and what you get on whole day tour (one price for all participants including shuttling, patrol etc...)\u00a0Dewa\u00a0speaks fluently English, he explains nearly everything, he has answered each of our questions, he is absolutely polite and really helpful. He picked us up at our hotel exactly in time, which could be important for Germans ;-)...(what I have to mention...I\u00a0am a German ;-)). We visited each point of our tour, got a lot of information and impressions of\u00a0Balinese\u00a0traditions and lifestyle. Furthermore,\u00a0Dewa\u00a0took a lot of great pictures with our camera and with our\u00a0smartphones...a lot of pictures of us in motion and in beautiful arrangements. So give him your camera and let him work ;-). Between the stops\u00a0Dewa\u00a0gave us a lot advises what to buy for what price and how to haggle best. Our wish to make a stop for lunch and get real\u00a0Balinese\u00a0traditional food was perfectly fulfilled. We got food we would never have found and never ate without\u00a0Dewa.I participated in a traditional water purification ceremony what I would never have done without\u00a0Dewa, too.So taken all together and recapitulating the whole day, it was a perfect day for us with a lot of fun.So plan your guided tour together with\u00a0Dewa, let him guide you around\u00a0Ubud\u00a0and enjoy your day in paradise!"

We were overly impressed with his suggestions and itinerary for what to see and do. He shared invaluable amounts of knowledge about the Balinese culture with us, came prepared with umbrellas and sarongs, but most of all, was friendly and kind. We will most definitely be recommending him to all friends/family who travel to Bali, and can't wait to come back to see him again.

He was also very knowledgeable about the different place and very flexible. He was constantly trying to help us to make the most of our Bali experience, going above and beyond what we expected. The best example of this was that our first day tour lasted 11 hours (instead of 9) and he was still open to do more if we wanted to. He took us to the Sekumpul waterfalls (which are out of the way, far north) and was with us the whole way, saving us the additional guide that you may need to get to the falls.Dewa's English is very good and made our visit in Bali so much better.

Fortunately, Dewa Alit was the only one available and my friends and I were very happy that we got him.

We learned a lot not only about the usual tour stuff but about the real Bali life from politics to doing business in Bali. He was also very intuitive of our needs, one stand out instance was when he came out of nowhere during the Kecak Dance in Uluwati to bring us water, without us asking, because we forgot to bring some and there was no way to get water where we were sitting. We did not even know how he located us in the crowd. He was always driving very safely and courteously the entire time.

However I wanted to give something back and hope my review will help you.I am a British female solo traveller and I found Dewa on trip advisor. There were a lot of other tour guides offering the same service but I chose Dewa as his reviews were brilliant and offered a more one on one service. I am so glad that!I arranged for Dewa to collect me from the airport and had also booked a half day tour for the next day. I can honestly say that I've never had so much fun. He put together an itinerary for me and also took me to a few other places that he thought I would like. I did, it was one of the best experiences of my life. I had such a great time that I booked him for the next day for a full day tour and I managed to see so much that other tourists wouldn't see. Even in the car journey you get to see so much of this beautiful country and learn so much about the Balinese culture.Before I met him I was a little apprehensive as I'm a solo female traveller and had never been to Bali before. However this changed as soon as I met him. He is a lovely guy with a great sense of humour and also a very safe driver. I felt so comfortable and at ease with him the whole time. He will go out of his way to make your experience memorable. Without him I wouldn't have seen as much as I did. It really was out of this world. I will be coming back to Bali and will definitely be using him again. I really can't recommend him enough. I have also booked him again for my last day in Bali to and we will be going to Kuta or Seminyak before he drops me off at the airport :(Thanks Dewa, you made my experience in Bali a great one :)"

We stayed in Ubud and we first organised to have a day trip to see the sights around the area. We were able to tell Dewa where we wanted to visit and even though it seemed like a lot, it all fell into place perfectly with his ordering of the activities. We visited many temples around Ubud and Dewa provided us with traditional sarongs to wear. We went to two amazing waterfalls, had lunch, and managed to do the ridge walk in Ubud. We felt very productive and glad to have Dewa there to explain the history behind the places we visited. Dewa also came in handy as an excellent photographer for us. He was always happy to help.The next day in the afternoon, Dewa was free to take us to Seminyak where we had planned to go to a few beach clubs and restaurants then took us back home. On the last day, he drove us to the airport. We had the best memories on the occasions Dewa was able to take us around Bali.We had some great conversations and laughs during our car rides. Dewa was great company and is very easy to get along with. He is a safe and courteous driver and his car was always comfortable and well air-conditioned during the long drives. I can't recommend his service highly enough. We will see you next time we're in Bali, Dewa. Thank you!"

He picked me up from the airport, even provided an already cold bottle of water (most welcomed in the heat of Denpasar) and asked me again about the places I wanted to visit. I've told him that I have some concerns about Pura Besakih, the mother temple, which I was planning to visit - all the reviews about how the tourists are treated there are rightfully terrible. He told me not to worry and he was right: being with him was as instructive as harrassment free. He is the best guide someone could desire! No \"donations\", no \"taxes of punishment\", not even asked for the entrance ticket!! Besides, he's a treasure of informations and always prepared to face the unexpected - he even had umbrellas and sarung for the visits of the temples (it was raining that day), always kind and driving like a pro!! Flexible and curteous, good English, always careful with the guest and decent prices!! Dewa, I cannot thank you enough!! Next time in Bali... Dewa again!! :)"

Dewa was the best choice I could possibly make for a driver and guide and I want to warmly recommend him to everyone who visits Bali.After I arrived in Ubud I realized I wanted to do a day tour and see more of the island than just the surroundings of the town. So on a rather short notice I contacted Dewa, he got back to me promptly and we agreed on a day tour that would take me to visit Bedugul with its lake-temple Danu Bratan, the hillside Batukaru temple and finally the rice paddy fields of Jatiluwih. The day on which we did the tour was the second day of the Galungan festival, so we were able to witness a lot of ceremonies going on in the temples and villages we passed. I had a lot of questions regarding the Balinese culture and Dewa was happy to answer them all and thus helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the island and its people. Due to some rain that forced us to change the order of our itinerary, the tour took longer than planned. But not once did Dewa try to rush me. When you hire Dewa, you don\u2019t just get a driver, but a kind and knowledgeable guide that is happy to show you his island and share with you its tradition and culture, if you\u2019re interested. He is attentive, very easy to talk to and altogether a pleasant company. He speaks English very well, has a good and comfortable car and drives safely. Whether you know specifically where you want to go and what you want to see, or you need someone to arrange a tour based on your general preferences, Dewa will make every effort to ensure you have an enjoyable and memorable tour. I certainly did. Thanks a lot for the great day, Dewa!"

We also visited the waterfall, had lunch and then went to the water temple. This was amazing! Our day was almost over but Wayan said we could still fit in the Monkey Forest, which was very cool....but watch out! Those monkeys are sneaky. Overall we were very happy with our day in Ubud and wish that we had more time and would have hired Dewa Alit tours for another day of site seeing. Wayan was happy to share personal stories with us as we were very interested in the different villages and traditions of Bali. Would highly recommend this tour company!

After contacting three different drivers from the Ubud area, my husband and I decided to book Dewa to be our guide and driver for two full days during our honeymoon. His prices were the most reasonable of the drivers we contacted, and he was super responsive to all of my emails. We stayed in several places during our honeymoon, and out of the six drivers we used, Dewa was by far the best driver we had during our entire stay in Bali. During the first day, my husband and I had a pretty clear idea of what we wanted to do and specific temples we wanted to visit. Dewa was super prompt when he picked us up, and took us to all of the destinations we had asked. Throughout the trip, he made sure to ask for our opinion in terms of timing (Ex: Do you want to spend another hour here and explore further, or do you want to head to our next destination and spend more time there?) Dewa's English is excellent, and what set him so far apart from the other drivers is that he is truly knowledgeable about all of the sites we visited. He accompanied us to every temple (some of which required serious hiking), and provided in depth knowledge about the history of the structures we were looking at, complete with specific dates/people/legends/etc. It was like having a personal museum guide the entire time. Both my husband and I enjoyed our visits to the temples so much more than if we hadn't booked Dewa because instead of just looking at interesting structures cluelessly, we actually learned the history and significance behind every single thing we were looking at. There were several times when I would just randomly point to things along our visit because it looked interesting and ask, \"What is that?\" And Dewa always had an answer and could explain everything with impeccable detail. On our second day, my husband and I relied more on Dewa's input for what we wanted to do because we didn't have specific locations we wanted to visit. We mentioned things like, \"We want to see woodcarvers.\" Dewa then suggested we first visit one shop where we could watch woodcarvers in action, but that we shouldn't buy anything because he would take us to a different shop with the same quality but much better prices. After visiting both shops, my husband and I were so glad that Dewa took the time to let us know about the second shop because it really was so much better of a deal without sacrificing quality. When suggesting other locations to visit, Dewa was very objective in describing the pros and cons of each location, but ultimately leaving the decision up to us. In between locations, Dewa was a pleasure to talk to, because he is such a gracious gentleman who cares deeply about his family. On both days, we offered to buy Dewa lunch, and he graciously refused. At the end of each day, we gave Dewa a huge tip, and both times he tried to protest, but we insisted that he deserved it. Overall, if you want a knowledgeable driver with fantastic English that can offer great insight into every location in Bali, book Dewa Alit and you will not be sorry!"

The travel was terrific. And he took very nice photos of me. Dewa speak very fluent English. There is no communicating problem. The price is also fair. I will recommend him to my friends if they go to Bali. And I will definitely invite him as my tour guide the next time because he is the most awesome tour guide I have ever met!"

Contacted Dewa short notice and arranged another day tour. Since we knew from my last visit back in April I completely trusted his ideas where to go this time. He managed to find a nice balance between sites I had visited, but interesting to my friends and something new that all of us surprised.Never seen such a kind and well educated person like Dewa.If you book a day trip you must see Dewa. I will always book him as he is an expert and entertainer at the same time.Once again, thanks Dewa. See you next time."

He took us to several different attractions including temples, a waterfall, a silver jewellery shop, coffee plantation, and a shopping centre. We learned so much about Bali and Balinese culture throughout the day. Our driver was very knowledgeable about the places we went and it was evident that he was proud of his culture and was excited to share it with us. I highly recommend Dewa Alit private tours to anyone. I would do it all again in a heart beat."

It's clear that Dewa is very organised and if a problem arises he's quick to accommodate you so you're not inconvenienced. When we then met up with Dewa we told him what we wanted to do the next day and he kindly steered us away from some less great attractions, recommended others and made sure we could fit everything into one day. He was so great the next day we kept him as guide for the whole time we were in Ubud. He took us to a great night market with amazing food, the mother temple was amazing and he's also a pretty good photographer. When we were leaving Ubud we arranged for transport through Dewa. Although he had another client coming in that morning he again organised our transport with a friend of his. His friend was also great and took us to a few places along the way to Legian that were just impromptu stops. If you want someone who's on time, courteous, understands what you want, is organised and will make it his mission to ensure you have a great time then book Dewa in a your guide. If he can't do it himself he'll know someone who's equally friendly who can and organise it for you."

We mostly started our days around 7 am and our drivers were always on time with clean, comfortable vehicles which they drove carefully through all the challenges that Bali traffic can offer.

AND he's was very good about taking a lot of pictures of us with our camera. Which is great because I'm usually too busy taking pictures of everything else that I forget about pictures of us.CUSTOMI had done A LOT of research before our trip to Bali and had mapped out the places and things we wanted to do and he obliged to all of them.

We first met with the Dewa Alit private driver (his name is Dewa Parba) at the airport, as we had arranged a transfer to Ubud. First impression: very friendly, warm, welcoming, eager to show us around. English: totally adequate. In brief: the services provided had a serious shortcoming: they were SO amazing and fulfilling that 4 days were just not enough to endeavour into real Bali and its numerous beauties! Of course it is the services provided by the company. But, to my opinion, our explicit experience was also due to Dewa Parba, our driver... The way he drove (fast, efficient and safe), knowing the perfect balance of making wishes come true but also taking the initiative to surprise you by making his own selections and suggestions, contributed to this perfection. Driving you with a spacious, clean car throughout Bali, being informative, polite, courteous, warm-hearted and smiling all the time really made us feel like his niece and nephew. No exaggeration! Although the trip was carefully planned by us from beforehand, he managed (together with the owner of the company) to have a surprise every day of our trip. We never thought that every day would make us say 'wooooow' for different reasons. That's the beauty of Bali! And we wish to deeply thank Dewa for helping see and live this through his eyes and heart. Practical things: he arranged the best, off the beaten track restaurants, walks within rice fields with the locals, a traditional relaxing massage, hiking to Mt. Batur with a local guide, visiting the white beach near Candidasa (known mainly amongst locals), wandering around the first traditional village of Bali, swimming in the Gitgit waterfall (during a tropical storm!), etc etc. Thank you so much, hope to see you again!! Conclusion: unconditionally, hand-at-fire recommended..."

We were really impressed initially, as we only sent a mail requesting this private tour the day before and received a quick and helpful response to our communication. The cost also was as advertised and seemed very worthwhile. However, our experience was in no way what other reviews of Dewa Alit reflect, particularly in terms of personal and local input offered to places visited. In fairness, we enjoyed safe transportation which is important on the winding roads. We also discovered during the day that our driver had apparently just lost a family member, which was probably why he appeared rather disinterested in providing an awesome experience and spent a great deal of time at places we visited on his mobile phone. Our disappointment however was mainly in that we felt as though we might as well have just joined a large tourist bus, and that the requests we had made for places to visit were not properly fulfilled. Our strong recommendation to others is to try and organise a private trip far in advance and be extremely specific in requesting and naming the places you wish to visit. We requested \"a chocolate and coffee plantation\" and were not taken to the Pod factory as we expected particularly as it was right next to the Elephant park we visited, but were instead taken to a type of coffee shop, the Subak Bali Agro, which is in a main street. and the kind of place that one has to sidestep busloads of tourists. There, apart from seeing a few plants and two sad baby Luwaks in a cage, we were offered (albeit with a very pleasant \"guide\") tea and coffee tastings and were made to feel obliged to then purchase from their very expensive shop. Also, after our visit to the Beratan temple, we were taken to a restaurant nearby and, on querying whether there was not a better option, we were told that we were less likely to get \"Bali Belly\" there. However, the very the indifferent buffet food on offer was again typical of a restaurant where busloads of tourists are taken and, bearing in mind our verbal request to have something typically Balinese, was not the kind of lunch venue recommendation we expected at all. What was most disappointing was to discover, not much further on close to the Munduk waterfall where we headed, a restaurant called \"the View\" offered the most amazing views (and has great reviews) and would have been a vastly preferable place to stop for lunch. Frankly, this was the kind of recommendation we would have expected from a driver who knows the area and has supposedly been driving tourists for over 20 years. While our day was pleasant enough, we felt we were being taken to \"canned\" places rather than being offered a more intimate experience through a private tour operator."

Unfortunately he was busy those days and sent us his good friend Mr. Dewa Parba :-) HE WAS GREAT!! We had 4 whole days tours and he drove us (the car was very clean and he was very careful) not only to the places i had asked for, but to other places and restaurants we didnt know! He arranged a massage and the hiking to Mt. Batur for us, we also visited many temples, the white beach near Candidasa, the first traditional village of Bali, the Gitgit waterfall, Lake Bratan, Jatiluwih & Tegallalang terraces and so many other wonderful places all over the island. Mr. Parba was so kind, patient and gendle with us. He speaks very good english and we had long talks during our trips for the Balinese life and customs. You have to ask for Mr. Parba when you visit Ubud! Thank you so much, hope to see you again!!"

            "review": "If You Have to Do One Comprehensive Tour in Bali..Go with Dewa. Initially, we booked Dewa with the premise that we would just hit up the 'must see' sites around Ubud like the Tegalalang Rice Fields, Titra Empul, and Gunung Kawi. However, we got much more than simply a driver to certain sites. We got a vibrant picture of and immersed in Balinese culture. Dewa has a good command in English not to mention a wealth of information about Balinese tradition and great patience! I must have changed our proposed itineraries 3-4 times and each time he patiently oblige to the changes. Our first stop was the Tegalalang Rice Fields, which he took us to a gorgeous walk around the rice fields. He was not shy to always grab the camera to take pictures for us and he knew where the 'go to places' were to get some great shots there. Disclaimer: the tour price pays for petrol, the tour, water, and driver. It does not pay for entrance fees and lunch. Please be advised that there is a 'city fee' when you get within the vicinity to the rice fields. Dewa is honest and looks out for you. There were multiple times on the rice fields that people would ask for donations and he will let you know when it's appropriate or not. He didn't have to but there were moments were he gave a donation on our behalf. The Tegalanglang Rice Fields were sweepingly gorgeous. On our 3 weeks in Bali, it was probably the most highest in elevation that we saw. Afterwards, we made a trip to Gunung Kawi, where we got a very extensive history lesson on each tomb and temple there. Land wise, its not too much to cover but the historical context was informative and extensive. We even ventured into the Kings special prayer room that not a lot of people would know about. There was even a touch of magic and folklore in his historical account of the temple. He let us know the first set of tombs off to the distance of the main temple were those of the King's four favorite consorts. Dewa knows his stuff. We went to the elephant temple as well but the most memorable was Titra Empul.I've read much about the temple and dreamed about participating in a blessing at the holy springs. No better way to experience a place than to do what the locals do. Dewa made it happen! Dewa explained the ritual and its cultural context and walked me through what I should do. There were torrential rains on that April afternoon we arrived. All the locals had taken shelter. When the rain let up a little, Dewa prompted we should go and offer our offerings at the holy springs. We got a little wet but it was such breathtaking experience. The fresh smell of rain was revitalizing and I had the whole holy spring to myself as I went through each fountain, meditating in the rain. There were large koi-like fish in the holy spring and it felt like I was in the scene of a Balinese folklore. Incredible! Note: if you want to participate in this, definitely bring an extra set of clothes, towels as you will be getting wet. Because it is a temple, you will need to wear a sarong into the holy spring and there are also other rules about women on their menstrual cycles not being permitted to enter the temple. I thought it was interesting and bit strange from a western perspective but when in another country, its always been my philosophy that you should respectfully observe their traditions and rules. With that said,we saw a water eel in the bubbling hot spring that fuels the holy springs. Per Dewa, this rarely happens and when the water eel appears, its a sign of immense luck. Without Dewa, we wouldn't have been able to have such an incredible day. Out of my 3 weeks in Bali, it was easily one of the best days in Bali It was also very affordable and fair. Unbelievably, his tour pricing is not per person, its for the whole tour itself. The day was all things I hoped for from the farthest corners of my imagination and truly Balinese. Thank you Dewa!"

            "review": "More of a private car than a tour . We started the day by being picked up from our hotel. The first destination was a local Balinese dance of the Barong. It took us approx 30 mins to get there with some quite erratic driving along the way, so much so that my wife felt car sick from the constant acceleration and braking. On the way we werent given much information regarding the dance from our guide. Instead we were handed a folder with one printed page explaining the dance. The Barong dance itself was interesting. After this we made our way to the silver Smith where a woman lead us around showing us briefly some of the techniques involved, which to be fair look very skilled and meticulous. We then proceeded to the show room with some over priced jewellery on show. A similar pattern was repeated at the wood carving centre. Again, it was good to look at these artists at work.From here we proceeded to a temple which was very beautiful. On arrival we happened to stop at his wifes shop who happens to sell sarongs needed to cover up going into the temple. What a coincidence!!! At the temple, our guide gave us a free pamphlet from the visitor section rather than go into detail about the various aspects of the temple. He did tell us about some aspects but very little, opting just to take pictures of us instead. The second half of the tour was an improvement. We went to a fruit and coffee plantation and we were given a guide. The guide they gave us was a young 23 year old chap and he was excellent, he had a good sense of humour, good english and had a lot of knowledge about the various different fruits, their uses and the coffee making process. We tasted several different types of coffee and tea and bought some in the shop towards the end of the tour. At one stage the guide climbed a tree to get is a piece of fruit. This was the type of interaction and knowledge transfer we hoped we would get on the tour as a whole. After this we went to look at the Batur volcano. We stopped at a pretty cool restaurant with a viewing gallery directly across from the volcano. We had lunch here. The food was poor, especially given how amazing Balinese food can be, but views during lunch are spectacular, explaining the completely overinflated price! Finally we headed for the Holy water springs and the padi fields which were quite picturesque again he waited in the car and just sent us off in. Overall we got to see many things- so pretty good itinerary, he Is a nice man and his car is spotless. Our main problems with the day were that despite what previous reviews say, Dewi's english is average at best. This is more of a private driver than tour guide, as I said, we saw a lot but just didn't receive much information at the locations. We found we really had to push him for information otherwise he didn't seem to volunteer it. Given that he is doing this for 22 years, his information was limited at times."

From our first interaction, Dewa was easy to communicate with and always timely in his responses. Since this was our first trip to Bali, he was able to suggest an itinerary for us and then was very flexible about changing things/moving things around as we talked through what we wanted to see and do and what we would be seeing on other tours we had organized. The day of our tour, Dewa picked us up on time at the hotel. His car was clean, roomy, and comfortable. As we went throughout the day, he was even more flexible with our itinerary as we decided on the spot where we wanted to spend more time and if we wanted to pass on things in order to see other spots. Dewa was friendly, informative, and such a sweet person. He spoke English very well. We really enjoyed the time we spent with him that day and felt like we had made a new friend. We learned a lot about the culture of Bali and about the sites we were seeing. He had so much pride for Bali and it was evident as he told us about each location. Because there was only so much time in the day, there were still other spots that we wanted to see before leaving the Ubud area. We asked Dewa if he was available on one of our other free days. Unfortunately, he was not due to a family commitment, but he was able to recommend his friend to drive us to the other locations. His friend was also great and we had no reservations knowing that he had been recommended by Dewa. Dewa really goes the extra mile for his clients. We thoroughly enjoyed our day with him highly recommend him to anyone looking for a driver/tour guide."

Dewa\u2019s English is quite good and I had no problems communicating with him.His car, a Toyota, was clean, comfortable and well maintained and the A/C worked just fine.We then tried to book a personalized tour with him several days later but he was booked up. He asked if he could have one of his friends who also had a tour car to do the trip. We agreed and texted with that driver who arranged for us to go on the trip that we requested. That trip was not one of the normal offerings in the Bali online driver websites but the driver Dewa had recommended pulled it off wonderfully.A week or so later I called Dewa to transfer us from Lovina back to Seminyak and do a tour of places along the way. He arrived on time (as were all of the trips booked through him). He took us to see a beautiful waterfall that you hike down to. We then went to a Warung that served Bali Suckling Pig with a view of beautiful rice terraces flowing down the mountainsides. We had him stop and educated us on how to buy and eat the Durian fruit (If you are unfamiliar with this look it up online, you may not want to try it). He was glad to do it as it was his favorite fruit to eat. He even bought some and tied it on to the back of the car to take home to his family.Dewa was very good at taking photos of my wife and me at the various places we visited. We have some great photos of the Temple in Tanah Lot. Go there if you get a chance.I look forward to returning to Bali some day and would not hesitate to give Dewa a call to arrange an airport and hotel pickups-transfers, or book a tour with him. He does not have the fanciest of website which, I am sure, keeps his cost to you down.https://drivingubud.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/2/"

He helped me plan a few days of sightseeing, making adjustments and recommendations on the sites that we wanted to see in a logical order. He was very engaging with my mother, daughter and I while sharing historical knowledge and insights to his culture. It takes much longer to get around Bali than I expected and I enjoyed learning from him throughout our time together. I highly recommend his touring services."

We are so pleased that we chose Dewa to give us a trip around Ubud and the surrounding areas.His English is excellent and he was able to give us lots of information and history related to where we were and what we saw. He is a great storyteller and his stories of the myths relating to the sites were fascinating.Nothing was too much of a trouble for him and we could tailor the trip completely to where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see. There was no pressure on us to buy anything from the local vendors we chose to visit- the day was very relaxed and enjoyable.Dewa was also very professional and organised, and it was very easy to make arrangements with him. Overall, we really enjoyed our tour- you're in for a day to remember with Dewa!"

We were recommended Dewa Alit from another couple who had used his tour service when they had visited a few months ago, and we were definitely not disappointed! We were looking for someone to show us around Ubud for the day and he did a great job. He picked us up from the hotel on time and drove us into the city showing us the various sites we requested. It was a super plus to have him there guiding us through the temple and explaining it all, otherwise we would have just been walking through it with no idea what we were looking at or the cultural meaning behind it. He also recommended a great place for us to eat lunch that was exactly what we were looking for. He even went to go get me some bottled water when we walking around in the heat and I mentioned I was feeling hot and tired.If you are looking for a driver or tour guide I would highly recommend Dewa Alit. He is very reasonably priced and does a great job!"

The car is a 4-wheel drive with all the mod cons (seat belts, aircon, lots of space for a family of four)."

Dewa has a laid back and cheerful way about him and I was so impressed with his carful driving I got him to take us to the airport too. Although a few dollars more than the taxi it was a lot more relaxing than any of my previous stressful, high speed, white knuckle bali taxi rides. Thanks Dewa"

He is also more than happy to take pictures for you and he is a good photographer!!! We visited the rice terraces in Tegallang, the Gunang Kawi, Holy spring water, Elephant cave and Taman Ayun temples, the Kintamani volcano and a coffee plantation. However, if you want to see more or less, Dewa is very flexible and happy to drive you wherever you want. You seriously couldn't get a better tour and it really is for a decent price. I am so happy I found him through trip advisor and I highly recommend him for a full day tour or a transfer to airport or another city. Thanks for making me discover your beautiful island Dewa!"

His English was excellent which not always happens with guides. He responded to an email inquiry very fast, and suggested a great itinerary. He even hiked to a waterfall with us and on the way back it poured! He thoughtfully had umbrellas and water in the car. The car was in an excellent condition. The only thing was, we booked him for 3 days, and he only spent one with us due to a schedule conflict. The driver we were delegated to was also great, however his English was not that good, which strained a conversation a bit. However, this should not be a deterrent. I am positive that if you book with Dewa tours, you will be well taken care of."

He happily answered all the questions we had, and I got a much better sense of Bali after talking to him.Because we had never been to Bali before, we took many of Dewa's suggestions and (among other things) saw a Barong dance performance, visited a few temples, went to the volcano for lunch, and visited the coffee plantation. When we expressed interest in purchasing a wood carving, Dewa took us to a great village where we had a huge selection of beautiful carvings to choose from. Dewa was very flexible and willing to do whatever we wanted to make the tour more enjoyable, but he also had helpful suggestions about things to do (both during our tour and for the rest of our stay in Ubud).Our tour with Dewa was one of the highlights of our trip.

Hiring a private driver and guide is really the only way to see the sights, both well-known and off the beaten path. Luckily it was low season and I was able to book Dewa on short notice after seeing the many outstanding and well-deserved reviews on TA. As advertised, he was very quick in responding to emails and the lines of communication were excellent throughout the booking process. He arrived to pick us up and we worked out an itinerary based on what we wanted to see and what he knew would be possible to do in a day. We were with him from 9 am 'til after 5 pm and he was informative and entertaining throughout the entire day. We were staying in Ubud and were moving on to Seminyak the day of the tour and he had no problem dropping us off at our next stop even though it was way out of his way.I found his website very helpful an accurate and the price was as advertised and included all gas and parking fees. With him as our guide we were able to get as close as possible to the temples with minimal walking as he knows all the back ways and secrets to all the major draws. For instance, don't be fooled by the sarong hawkers trying to tell you that you'll need to buy a sarong before entering temples. Dewa advised us that sarongs to borrow for your visit are included with you entrance fees. He was also helpful with avoiding many of the tourist ripoffs as the locals will not try to pull one over on you if you're with him as he knows them all! And he's also a very capable photographer and was eager to take the many shots my wife and I wanted to be in to capture our trip - felt like we had our own personal photographer as well!I look forward to going back to Bali and I will definitely book another tour with Dewa. There is just too much to see in one day so we will be back and Dewa will be our guide. There is absolutely no reason to try to do this on your own or with a big tour company, support a local and get a more authentic experience"

We were looking for a driver for a full-day tour into the countryside and wanted someone who could recommend places he thought we might like instead of the regular tour itineraries (we can find those places in a guidebook ourselves), the flexibility to adjust the itinerary to handle serendipitous events (we don't like to be chained to an itinerary), and the interest in his passengers to talk with us instead of having a private conversation on his cell phone the entire drive (we had already experienced that with another driver who wore headphones on a trip to the Jatilowih rice fields). In short, we wanted more than just a \u201cdriver\u201d but also a cultural guide. Although drivers in Ubud are ubiquitous, we went to TripAdvisor to find a driver we thought would be appropriate. Based on the reviews, we thought Dewa would be perfect, and we were not disappointed. Dewa arrived at our homestay in the morning and we planned out an itinerary for the day. But soon into our drive into the countryside, we found a temple preparing for an upcoming cremation ceremony. Instead of driving by or simply pointing out what was happening as we continued on, Dewa asked if we wanted to stop. He then took us on a tour of the temple, describing the process of the ceremony itself and explaining the meaning behind each of the extensive offerings and other items. A great start to the day! Besides being a valuable cultural resource, Dewa is also a great conversationalist. During the drive, our children enjoyed the Balinese folk story of the garlic and the onion (a good child/ bad child fable) and continued to talk about it several days later. Dewa also shared a song he learned in school about planting according to the days of the week (in response to a question about planting according to the Balinese calendar). There was plenty of conversation for adults too on practically any arts, culture, social, economic or political topic under the sun. More than just a driver or tour guide, Dewa seemed to enjoy sharing his thoughts and insights about Bali with us. Besides Dewa\u2019s interest in his passengers, his calm, professional demeanor really stands out. He also seems to enjoy rising to the challenge of meeting the specific requests of his passengers -- he actually listened to us! We asked to go to Tenganan because we were interested in weaving. He took us there, but he also suggested a little-known ikat workshop in a town along the way that we much preferred, with Dewa explaining each step of the ikat process as we watched. Later in the day, we asked if there was a beach nearby where our children could play in the waves. Dewa thought a minute and then brought us to a small hidden sandy cove near Padangbai which was just what we were looking for. Dewa knows the island well but seems to enjoy discovering new places as well, including a recently opened warung where we ate lunch.If you want to maximize the number of miles and sites you visit on your day trip, then there are many drivers who may be able to take you faster and further, checking more items off the list and providing you with an exhilarating driving experience. But if you are looking for a careful driver with a professional attitude, a wealth of cultural information and who is a great conversationalist, then Dewa should be at the top of your list. With Dewa, we visited all the places we had planned and more."

Dewa dives deeper beneath the typical guide's commentary to share personal and cultural stories.

Truly a life changing experience!I highly recommend Dewa Alit as a warm, personable, professional, knowledgeable guide and safe driver."

Among other delights, we spent a number of days with Dewa driving the countryside, visiting temples, seeing the sights, and learning much about local culture, etc.. Probably the highlight of my experience was immersing myself (and spirit) in spring fed holy waters after being educated by Dewa of the ceremonial process, Wow!, what a guide! After just 3 days, I felt like he was part of our clan. Highly recommend Dewa to anyone visiting Bali!"

Dewa was recommended by my partner's friends and he proved to be an excellent host throughout our time.More than just a safe driver, Dewa possesses intimate local knowledge that will come in useful be it for casual travellers or serious explorers. We worked out an itinerary based on his recommendations and had a superb time on the three days we engaged him to bring us around. His ability to provide information on every place we visited was invaluable and he was able to suggest viable alternatives when we wanted to make some changes for our schedule. Dewa also gave us good tips on places to eat at and is overall very honest with his thoughts, such as when discussing travel recommendations we gleaned online.Dewa was always on time when it came to fetching us at our hotel and he had plenty of anecdotes to regale us with during long trips, but also left us to rest in peace when we were tired. A class act, his prices are also more than reasonable for the level of service he provides.Friendly, patient and helpful, Dewa is highly recommended if you need someone to bring you around during your time in Bali and we will definitely engage his services again if we make a return trip."

In Bali we decided to do it 5 star and Dewa was commesurate to the experiences we'd had with every other service provider of a similar calibre. Dewa is polite, well presented, knowledgeable and above all patient / flexible. Scheduling is fluid but well managed as far as getting the most out of your time and his eating recommendations/choices are more than adequate from an affordability and cleaninliness point of view. Don't bother with a half day tour; its not enough to fit in all the most interesting temples and sights. Have him pick you up at 9am and take you back at 6. Finally, keep in mind that he has to pay for parking and tolls at numerous locations and a full tank of petrol if you're staying in the south as we did - so his price is very reasonable."

Always prompt in replying to emails, he was also flexible in incorporating special requests to visit certain places as well as generous with advice and suggestions on other places to visit. On the days he had to pick us up, Mr Dewa was always early and waiting patiently for us. He is a safe driver and his driving style can only be described as being \u201cvery stable\u201d. Even my husband (who is so used to being in the driver\u2019s seat and sometimes gets nauseous while being driven by others) had nothing but praise for Mr Dewa\u2019s driving. His vehicle was always clean and smelt nice. At the tourist sites, Mr Dewa would show us around and also help in taking pictures. It felt reassuring to have someone we know and trust waiting for us and showing us around Bali. We have nothing but praise for Mr Dewa and would, without hesitation, recommend him to anyone visiting Bali."

Dewa was highly recommended by a friend 6 years ago and he was what made our first trip so amazing. He shared a lot about the Balinese culture, took us to the key temples and a healer who we had heard about, recommended excellent restaurants and helped us to feel comfortable as first time international-travelers. I made sure to look him up when I knew we were coming back again, because even though we were traveling with a group and had access to other highly recommended drivers, I knew the trip wouldn't be the same without reconnecting with Dewa. We once again had a very positive experience. We had already gone to many of the key sites wih the group we were with but he was able to help us think though some other activities we'd like to do. He took us snorkeling at a wonderful spot and our friend who has lived in Bali for 20 years commented, \"Wow, he must be an exceptional driver and guide because most local people don't ever think to take people there. It's often kept as a secret.\" He was also willing to drive us to several artists so that my now teenage son could fim a documentary. He used his own personal connections and knew right where to go to find some other master artists as well. Across our trips, I've experienced Dewa guide us to the popular sites most tourists would want, and be willing to guide us on a variety of different experiences during our second visit. He was always on time, polite and resectful, a safe driver, and an interesting source of information about Bali. He is also such a kind and good person (and clearly a very supprtive husband and father to his family) that I was delighted for my children to meet him and to have time with him again. I offer him my highest recommendation!"

All of which makes him the PERFECT GUIDE. More than that, however, he is also a wonderfully friendly, warm, kind and caring man. A true gentleman.

I'm knocking off one star simply because his website needs to be updated. His pricing for the day was actually double from what was listed on his website.

He is great putting together an itinerary for you, but when you go to the sites he doesn't accompany you - he stays with the car.Very nice guy, I'd use his services again!"

Subsequent tours included transit between Ubud and Candi dasa and between Candi dasa and Legian, stopping at any places of interest or upon request on the way.

We called, but Dewa Alit, was booked up personally.He did however coordinate us with driver named Dewa Arba.We were extremely pleased, so much so we hired an additional day. We had six in our group and his can comfortably fit us all. It was a newer Suzuki van and the aircon worked awesome.His driving was very controlled and we felt very safe. He did excellent job of coordinating the things we wanted to do. English was solid and for 90% dialogue went with out a hitch, the rest just had to rephrase but it all worked out.Now, as first time Bali visitor we really utilized trip advisor laying out activity themes, but did not specify exact businesses. Dewa Arba did great job of providing what we requested by theme. For example we said we wanted to see local wood carvings, he then selected exact business, same for meals and such. The results met what we asked for but was through and through tourist spots, in hindsight i might have hand picked a couple of the business ahead of time.Overall though Dewa Arba did phenomenal job and i will keep his number. So if Dewa Alit cannot help then request through him Dewa Arba."

I booked him via TripAdviser a month or two before, and he was very prompt in returning my emails and suggesting an itinerary when I requested help to do so. He was more than happy to amend to suit my preferences, once I arrived and had a better idea on what I'd like to see, including adding things en-route on whim. He happily shared cultural and historical knowledge throughout the drive. And his car was beautifully clean, his driving perfectly safe. He was also keen to hear about my culture and role as a health coach in Australia. Dewa, I mentioned you in my most recent blog post at Health & Wellness Revolution, I do hope I shared your insights correctly! Thanks Dewa, all the very best, and hope I can use your services again."

He's a pleasure to be with. Make your visit special by having Dewa show you Bali."

Other drivers said they could drive and help us get guides but quoted significantly higher overall pricing. Dewa also took us yo and through Gunung Kawi on the way home end explained the history including the legends surrounding this place and was all organised with outfits for our whole family and cold water for us - a really exemplary driver."

We wanted to hire him the day we were due to leave our hotel in Ubud to move to Nusa Dua. Our plan was to see various sights on the way. Dewa explained that this would be a long day but still quoted a reasonable price which was cheaper than the hotel wanted just for a taxi service. Dewa picked us up on time and was an excellent driver. Whenever we stopped he gave us the option of time on our own or he would join us and explain the area we were in, such as temples and the monkey forest. He also asked us if we wanted lunch in restaurant in Seminyak or a local warung. We opted for a local warung and had amazing suckling pig. All 3 meals plus 5 drinks cost less than 1 beer in the hotel. At the end of the day he took us to Uluwatu Temple for the sunset. Whilst here he took us along a path to a quiet place away from the crowds to watch the sunset. Another piece of invaluable advice was not to wear sunglasses because of the monkeys. We saw one lady have hers snatched from her face by one cheeky monkey. When we arrived at the hotel we were shattered. Dewa had been driving for 10 hours, mainly in heavy traffic, and he still had a 2 hour drive home. All day we felt safe with his driving, his car is very comfortable. I would not hesitate in recommending him to anyone looking for a guide in Bali."

Can't thank my friend enough for this recommendation. Dewa is an excellent choice. He's very careful, friendly and polite, reliable and especiall we learnt a lot about local culture, places of interests and interesting stories from him. He's more than a driver, he's an super tour guide full of knowledge. If you want a peace of mind on the road, starting out comfortably on your trip there, email Dewa:)"

We arrived on a cruiseshp and had arranged for Dewa to meet us at the pier and bring us to our hotel in Nusa Dua. This was arranged via e-mails and telephone calls. From the first meting to the final good-by four days later was a perfectly delighful experience. Dewa is a careful driver and with the plethora of motorbikes in Bali, excellent driving skills are vitally important. Dewa is a font of information about Bali, Hinduism, politics and Balinese culture and history. We not only saw tourist attractions like the Lake Temples and rice Terraces and the elephant preserve, but Dewa took us to different villages and local neighborhoods. He is an excellent tour guide with perfect English make Dewa Alit Tours yours the right choice when visiting Bali."

I do use other drivers, but what I find special about Dewa is his incredible knowledge of Balinese culture and history AND his ability to tell amazingly detailed stories that bring this all to life. Sure, other drivers know culture and history, but he has a particular personal passion for some of the more meaningful tourist destinations like Gunung Kawi (mountain god temple) and Pura Tirta Empul (holy springs temple). I've been to Pura Tirta Empul three times, each time with a different guide. Dewa made the experience the most meaningful, to actually change into proper attire and be bathed/cleansed in the holy water, and he told us what every single spiggot of water meant, etc, etc. I also had clients with me this past trip when he took us to these places and they were equally impressed. I would definitely go back to these sites with him. And of course he is everything you want a guide and driver to be: courteous and professional, a safe driver, etc. His fees are also consistent with all other drivers I've met."

He's careful and reliable (the importance of which cannot be overstated in Bali), an extremely competent driver. He's been doing it for 21 years, speaks excellent English, and his knowledge of Balinese culture, tradition, and special areas outside of the usual tourist zones is top notch. Also, he offers fair, reasonable prices. It is possible to find someone cheaper (though not by much) but you get what you pay for, and you can rest assured he will never artificially inflate the price. He'll even meet you at the airport if you contact him by email with enough advance notice-it's such a warm relief to see a smiling Dewa holding a sign with your name on it once you step outside the airport into the chaos after a long flight!"

And that started a most wonderful relationship. He drove us late at night to Ubud, helped us get settled in our room at the Melati Cottages (where we stayed for 23 nights), and the next day helped us get a phone and gave us a tour of Ubud. Every time we needed something, Dewa was there. He loved to laugh at my husband's jokes. He helped us get temple ready at every temple. He is a very knowledgable, friendly, helpful, dependable, trustworthy, kind, lovely man. We stayed at three different ocean-side resorts our last four nights in Bali. He drove us to Lovina where we all stayed overnight. Then he drove us to Amed where my husband and I stayed two nights. Dewa went home to his wife and two lovely children, but first he arranged for a driver to take us to Candidasa. Our last day, he picked us up in Candidasa and took us on a tour on our way to the airport. I highly recommend Dewa Alit to be your driver when you go to beautiful Bali."

He was also very flexible with our plans and managed to fit in an extra destination for us in the afternoon.There are not many drivers that will go above and beyond to help you out. When it rained he had umbrellas to hand, and even offered to wait while we sorted out our dinner to take away on the way home, -as the rain was too heavy for us to go back out on our scooter after drop off! Very reasonable day rate with a comfortable A/C car and complementary supply of mineral water. He very much deserves his good reputation."

But he is also very good to get to know you, and propose you alternative places (like visiting the garden of a farmer full of different plants!). He can help you to arrange your visit plan, and book additional activities. He will also take time to introduce you to each visited place, but then let you enjoy it by yourself at your pace.Our 2 sons really enjoyed the times in the car (he is a safe driver)! And good music!Don't hesitate to book your trip with Gusti!Aurelie, Baptiste, Candide & Thibault"

Thumbs Up service!. it was just a random click on the internet when i was searching for tours on our Bali escapade with my girlfriend.. tripadvisor came up.. different tour and travels agencies came up and saw Bali Wayan.. i read some reviews on tripadvisor and it is mostly positive so i proceed to visit their website. i got to know a lot of information about their private tours and about Mr. Wayan. because i was interested, i immediately contacted him thru email and the response was quick.. he entertained all my questions.. when i travel i'm used to making my own itenerary for the trip.. i don't usually have fixed tours as travel agencies will offer. Mr. Wayan said that it would not be a problem as the rate for the tour depends per hour.. they have a full day tour and a half day tour depending on the places you will visit.. so i confirmed with him the places we want to visit and said it was manageable.. he also added that other tourist change plans during the tour so its not also a problem if we change our minds regarding places to visit.. regarding payment.. he said that we will pay on the day of the tour.. no creditcard needed to confirm bookings.. he just needed name and flight details for their record.. i said i will contact him again when our trip is final..i have used a lot of Mr. Wayans time regarding details for our tour so we just decided to book thru him days before our trip.. we arranged for airport pickup and hotel transfer which costs extra (fair enough as He lives in Ubud and Airport and Hotel in in Kuta area) and straight to our Full day tour.. again he responded quickly thru email.. we are fortunate that Mr. Wayan will be the one to provide us the tour as scheduled.. they have other dirvers and tourist guides available under Mr. Wayan.. so all was set we are just waiting for vacation in Bali to start..upon arrival in Bali.. Mr. Wayan was there holding a card with our names and greeted us with a smile.. we were excited to start our tour.. Mr. Wayan mostly relied on the itenerary i sent him but also suggested some other places to see to benefit our trip.. he was very Informative, very Knowledgeable and speaks GOOD english.. he made sure that we enjoy, we are comfortable and feel SAFE during our trip.. by the way he takes good picture also.. We were over the alloted hours for our Fullday trip during that day but he said we dont have to worry about it, Mr.Wayan just wants us to ENJOY and take our time during the tour.. we were very thankful for that! We also booked a Halfday tour with mr. wayan during our 3rd day.. He was on time to pick us up and again the tour was great and comfortable and safe..maybe all private tourist guides and drivers are like this in Bali Indonesia because they want to have more clents and dont want to loose any.. same set up and same service.. we just felt safe and comfortbale with Mr. Wayan (my first and only choice during my research) we are very fortunate to have him as our guide.. Thankyou Mr.Wayan for helping us in such short time see what Bali has to offer..You can't be wrong in choosing Bali Wayan private tour and driver.. book now and enjoy Bali!"

When I emailed Mr.Wayan (I call him Palguna) for the tour details and the price, we got a quick reply with all the package details and the price. I appreciate his immediate response. He greeted us at the airport with the name tag. On the way to the hotel, we discussed the tour plans and the timings. Next 4 days, he was with us. During the travel, he was very informative about Balinese life culture, religious activities and the history of Bali. He was very professional and punctual every day to pick us from the hotel and understood our interests. Since we visited during the off-season and rainy days, he planned the day trip accordingly to the weather forecasts and the traffic. We visited Kintamani village, Mount Batur, Tirta Empul, Tanah Lot, Uluwatu Temple, Ulun Danu Bratan Lake Temple, other temples and dance programs around Bali. Especially during Tirta Empul holy bath, he took care of us as a brother. He brought some prayer items and performed prayers with us. What we liked him was his patience, smiley face and experience in handling us. Some of his photos that he took were very artistic. It was really a wonderful experience for us to visit Bali with such a nice person. I felt that he is one among us. It is great to have him with us for the whole trip. We will be definitely visiting Bali with Palguna again during our next trip."

It was a long day (8.30-8.30) but Wayan never faltered in his cheerful demeanour - he drove us around all day, showing us some unique local hotspots (such as a beautiful temple at the bottom of volcano Mt Batur which is almost never touched by tourists) and doing a very long drive almost around the entire island. He provided extra water for us because we wanted to trek through the rice fields, he negotiated deals on souvenirs, he paid parking fees and donations out of his own money, he knew a great local buffet restaurant with incredible view over the mountains and knew exactly when to participate and when we wanted to be on our own. Even so much as when we invited him for lunch he insisted on eating on his own! Wayan was an incredible guide and we would recommend him 1 million percent - a very knowledgeable man with lots of fascinating information about Bali and its people. Do not consider any other tour - Wayan has the personal touch and shows you the \"real\" Bali with genuine Balinese warmth and hospitality."

We also asked for a tour of some of Ubud attractions, the sunrise hike, and to Amed.Wayan was phenomenal, always on time and friendly with water waiting for us. He drove through the night twice to ensure we could be picked up, and offered great conversation about the local traditions along the way.Also, when we asked for changes to the itinerary, he showed us some great hidden spots away from most tourists. Really wonderful trip to Bali and highly recommend asking Wayan to show you around!"

Gusti speaks good English and we had no problems communicating and understanding more of the Balinese culture and the way of life of the locals there. He even provided us with information of interesting places to visit nearby the sites we have gone and introduced a little more of the culture and beliefs the Balinese villagers have.Gusti was very knowledgeable in providing the shortest cuts to some of the places we wanted to go as well as recommended good clean food along the way.Gusti was one of the best private tour guides we have met and am glad we have engaged him for our first Bali trip. It was such an impressionable and pleasant experience! Will definitely be back and will once again engage him as our private driver and tour guide for our family and friends. Price was very reasonable too!\""

He is very professional and a truly honest, trustworthy, nice, funny and very kind person. He was always on time. I got stomach sick for something I ate and he was always caring and asking how I felt, he even gave me some essential oil that really helped me. He was always in a good mood and we bombarding him with a lot of questions about Balinese culture, he was always more than happy to explain us things about their way of life and rituals. He also recommended us great places to have dinner in Ubud. He also took us to the airport the last day. (great and safe driver, brand new car with a/c)I wouldn't hire any other guide in Ubud, Wayan Pal is the best!

They are the by far some of the most welcoming people that I have ever met. Not only are they punctual, and extremely knowledgeable about all thing Bali, they provide a comfortable and safe service, there was not one time in which I felt slightest bit uncomfortable! It was great!!! Not to mention Gusti has some great photography skills and if you\u2019re feeling some touristy moments he is more than happy to capture them on your camera for you. They know the best places to eat, great places to shop, the best roads to travel on (so that if time allows it, they will even take you to see other places!!!), they are also super flexible with the itinerary, if you want to see or do something they will try their best to take you there. When travelling with Wayan and Gusti not only do you get amazing drivers/ tour guides, you get some awesome new friends too. I would recommend them to everyone and anyone wanted to experience the wonderful island of Bali.

So through a Balinese friend I was introduced to Wayan Palguna. Wayan as we call him, has an aviatic background and excellent customer service knowledge. We were exchanging mails and he was very kind to offer his services to care for our young couple friends. This couple was travelling to the Far East for the first time and they were so excited about their trip to Bali and didn't know what to expect. Although we never met Wayan we got off on a good start and we trusted him to meet our friends on arrival in Bali. Wayan met Christian & Manuela on arrival and showed them around Bali the following day. According to our friends they were grateful that such a kind, friendly and trustworthy strange could care so much for them. Their expectation on Bali was beyond what they imagined. They thoroughly enjoyed visiting Bali and the Gilli Islands and are now planning for their next trip.I do recommend Wayan Pulgana to anyone looking for an excellent English speaking guide."

We did not have any specific plan because it was only 1 \u00bd days trip and needed to get the whole trip worth of money. I like sight-seeing and shopping while my husband more to carving stuff and food. Based on our budget and time, surprisingly he could brought us to those places which we could not forget. So fantastic.The padi terrace in Tegalalang, the wood and stone carving Ubud, Kuta beach and souviner shops /shops (so many of them) in Tuban / Kuta all satisfied our needs. We feel safe with him. Not forgotten eating places he recommended which are delicious and cheap. You can ask anything to Pak Wayan on culture or history of Bali, he would definitely explain to you in detail either in Indonesian language or English, up to your preference. We compliment of his clean vehicle, nice smell and free mineral water and he was driving so carefully since the road is quite small.We no doubt we will ask for Pak Wayan for our next trip. He is negotiable, you may change or add or reduce your need according to your preference. Pak Wayan never pressured us on anything.Highly recommended for those who are seeking for HONEST, GOOD, SAFE , KNOWLEDGEABLE , FUN and ENGLISH speaking tour guide.Thanks Pak Wayan, regards to your family. \uf04a- HANIZA, malaysia"

The car is comfortable with air conditionning and service include fresh water... and maybe beer or coke if you are nice enough ;)We recommand to use his service, especially if you want to visit differents cities in the same day.Like anything in Bali, you have to negociate but the price is very good for the quality of the service. We didn't have to negociate and he stay with us 8-9 or 10 hours for the same price... and always with the smile and with the camera! He made beautiful pictures of my wife and I.... for the first time we have a lot of pictures of us!! You can change your plan during the day without problem.The only thing to be aware is commission, but it's everywhere in Bali. So if someone bring you to a restaurant, to buy trip or boat ride, you will paid a higher prize than if you came alone (always negociate!!!). So take your time, compare the price and to buy too quickly. Wayan never pressure us to buy and even tell us to go online or to others compagnies to compare... that the only way to do if you don't want to paid 3 times the regular prizes!Finaly, Wayan made our trip to Bali fun and we keep many beautiful memories and pictures! If you looking for a driver/guide for one day or more, don't hesitate to call him, you won't regret it!"

My friend Jacinta did some internet research before we went to Bali and stumbled across this company. The first intial email response she got was fantastic and warming. When we got to Bali we were picked up by Wayan (our driver). He welcomingly greeted us and we were very excited to be there. Based off the emails Jacinta and I organised our day tours with Wayan and he was very happy to accommodate where we wanted to go and had excellent knowledge of each destination.In our short stay Wayan took us White Water Rafting, to the Kecak Dance and Culture Show, Pemerintah Kabupaten Tabanan Temple, Sari Merta Coffee Plantation, Monumen Perjuangan Rakyat (Museum), Turtha Empul (Holy Spring Temple), Sacred Monkey Forest and to other Rice Fields, Coffee Plantations and authentic Balanise markets. We had 3 full day tours with Wayan, he was always on time and was even very happy to wait for us when we were running a little late!! I thoroughly enjoyed and loved every single day and tour Wayan took us on that I want to go back very soon! We saw so many great things and with Wayan\u2019s great knowledge, it made it so much more special. He was always happy and eager to answer questions and we felt very comfortable and at ease with him. Wayan's English is excellent and we had many intriguing, fun, great and happy conversations during our driving trips. Wayan was a big part of our Bali experience and it was almost like having a trustworthy, local friend to show us around. He even took photos of us on a great SLR camera and sent them to us!! Not just that though he gladly stopped when we needed to, was very trustworthy and even bought us fresh water bottles every day! I highly recommend his tour company and will be telling all my friends and family about him if they go to Bali. Wayan, Thank you so much for one of the best experiences of my life in Bali. I hope to come back very soon with Jacinta and explore more of Indonesia. Warm Regards and a hug Krystal :)"

We basically could spare one day so i planned for a one day out to Ubud . After corresponding with a few tour operator & drivers, whilst others were fast at their response but some lack in their ability to write back in a more informative and detailed manner as compared to WAYAN. i wanted to do many things in that day!We had a jam-packed day and our itenary goes as this. WAYAN was at our villa in Seminyak early before 830am and we managed to set off by 845am :- Legong dance at Batu Bulan ( okay we didnt stay till the end of it , approx 40 mins of the 1 hour show) - bought polo tops at outlet ( Wayan, it is not cheaper at all ! do not buy from the outlet, better off jus buying from normal shops) - monkey forest- Lunch: ribs at nuri (Still yummy) - coffee at seniman ( Great coffee) - clean our face with holy water at tirta temple -walked a lil at tagallang rice terrace (next time should have food or relax at one of the restaurant here) - enjoyed the chillness at kintamani mt batur view ( Wayan was so nice to get permission from one the restaurant that has really good view for picture taking and away from the hassle of people trying to sell you things) - then to tanah lot for beautiful sunset ( you can't go up to the temple but just enjoy at the ground ) -kecak dance at tanah lot (was pretty funny ) ... and we manage to finish all that by 730pm and we arrived back at villa by 9pm. We even stop by the convenience shop to buy some beer and snacks for the villa.We probably had it lucky with the Galungan/Kuningan festival and traffic seems to be way better than usual on that Friday.WAYAN have been superbly nice from start to finish. He have even arranged for a map for us when i requested it on email as i can't seem to find one normally in airport. Water bottles are well supplied during the entire journey. There was even a cooler box that has coke , juices in it ( No beer =) ) for our drinking pleasure. I want to thank Bali Wayan Private Tour & Driver especially WAYAN for making this experience so pleasant and being ever ready to hear us out and accomodate our requests.I hope to use WAYAN again for any future tour and definately will recommend to all my friends and family."

He will suggest places you haven't been before.I also used Gusty to pick up my family members for my wedding and Gusty was on time for all of them and always went above and beyond my expectation.Honestly, it would be hard to find another great driver like Gusty and his amazingly friendly nature.Would recommend Gusty's service to anyone who visits Bali.See you soon GustyTom & Chihiro - Newly Weds"

I went to Bali for my brother's wedding and we hired our private driver \"Gusti\" every single day during our one week stay.I don't usually bother writing reviews, but feel Gusti absolutely deserves the recognition.Besides the permanent \"smile\" pasted on his face, Gusti is honest, reliable, on time and above all, a pleasure to be around. By the second day, the whole family wanted him around the dinner table and we loved sharing our meals with him.Look no further, Gusti is great and we have become friends.I will be using him again next time I am in Bali.Thank you for your hard work and kindness GustiCheers,Tosh"

The price was reasonable and I appreciated their flexibility to pick me up and drop me off. I definitely recommend Ubud Friendly Driver and Jun, either if you are traveling alone or in a group.

Nyoman had plenty of suggestions of other activities we could do as a family traveling with young children. Their service was prompt, well priced and both Nyoman and Kadek spoke fluent English which made communication very easy. I cant speak highly enough of Kadek. He was very polite and helpful.

            "review": "Amazing day with Made at Pura Lempuyang...but the car was very uncomfortable :-(. I found Ubud Friendly Driver from TA and since it has many positive reviews so I decided to go with them. Right from beginning, the emails communication with Astawa were really excellent. He always replied me promptly and he also answered my tons of questions really well. We actually booked the car for 2 days. One for halfday tour to go to Tegalalang rice terrace/Gunung Kawi Temple/Pura Tirta Empul. The price quoted was 500,000 rupiahs. But unfortunately we didn't end up using the service cos the driver had a flat tyre on that day so he was really late in picking us up. We wanted to start at 7.30am to avoid crowds and hotter temperature at the rice terrace, but by 8am, the driver still hadn't arrived. We called Astawa and he said about the flat tyre and apologized. So we waited a little bit more but the driver still hadn't arrived so in the end we decided to call Astawa back to cancel it. Thankfully our hotel could take us instead even though the price was a bit higher, we didn't mind at all cos time was running out. By the time we agreed with the hotel, the driver (Made) arrived. For a moment, we didn't know what to do and felt quite bad. Made apologized and we apologized too. But we said to him that we would still keep our booking for the next day.The next day we had a full day tour to go to Pura Lempuyang and this time Made was on time. So we're right on schedule. The price was 800,000 rupiahs. Made was a great driver and a great guide. I really enjoyed his company and he climbed together with me all the way up to 4th temple at Pura Lempuyang. He also explained all the Bali cultures very well to me. It was such a beautiful and special experience cos I got to witness the ceremonies at Pura Lempuyang. Just beautiful! I only climbed up to 4th temple. Next time, my goal was to climb all the way up to the highest one 7th temple :-)However, I have one complaint...the car was really uncomfortable. We felt it was not properly maintained. I remembered it was an Avanza car and normally Avanza is a good comfortable car cos my parents own one and we also used Avanza car when we did the tour with our hotel the day before and their car was so much better. So because of this, we didn't really have comfortable journey and it was such a long drive to Pura Lempuyang and the roads were all twisting, so we both got carsick :-( Thankfully we didn't throw up and I had to rest a bit after we arrived at Pura Lempuyang before commencing the climb. We got carsick again on the way back...but it's not as bad as before. Astawa emailed me again after that asking of how my trip was...and I told him all the good and bad things, exactly as what I wrote here and I hope he would take on board both my compliment and also my complaint. But there's no reply from him. So...Well despite of my carsickness, I really enjoyed Pura Lempuyang so much and I would want to go back to East Bali again next time to explore more. We actually planned to go to more places on 2nd day but there's just simply no time so we cancelled them. We also paid Made extra 200,000 rupiahs on 2nd day, just as a good gesture for the 1st day that got cancelled. So good friendly driver, but uncomfortable car...unfortunately"

We we're fearing the worst because we didn't book in advance but UFD (Ubud Friendly Driver) had a driver available for us. I mailed UFD the day we arrived in our hotel with a list of the sights we wanted to visit and if it was doable in the time we had. Received a mail back in no time. The email communication was a bit confusing to me, so I ended up calling to clear some things up. After that we confirmed our booking.We initially booked UFD for 3 days to see all sights around Ubud but needed a driver to Lovina on the fourth day, so I mailed UFD to check if our driver was available to take us to Lovina aswell and visit some sights. Turned out our driver was also available for the fourth day, few emails back and forth and the booking was confirmed.I can definitely recommend Jun as driver. Very kind guy and good sense of humor. Skilled and careful driver, making sure you have a pleasant ride. We are glad he was our driver for four days. Arrived on time every day, usually 30 minutes before. Took us to the sights we wanted to see but also had his own suggestions, which were on the way and got us to some pretty cool places. Not only a good driver but also a fine tourguide. Pretty knowledgable about the places he took us and kindly waited outside during our lunchbreaks or places that didn't allow the drivers in without paying admission.Thanks for everything Jun and UFD, will definitely recommend this company to friends visiting Ubud, Bali.Regards,Roel & Simone"

Managed to go to different places including very nice scenery and great culture over the day. My driver name was Kadek Ka Fux. He was very friendly and told me a lot of information about balinese history. He also played great music in the car which was a plus . I really enjoyed the day and would recommend the company to anyone."

Our driver for the day was Made Parta, he was very knowledgeable and friendly. We visited many great places over the course of the day including some temples, waterfalls, rice paddies, volcano, luwak coffee plantation and also the monkey forest. We were picked up from our hotel in Seminyak on time and the car was clean and air conditioned. We would definitely recommend this company for anyone looking to have a great day trip out to Ubud. We look forward to booking more tours with them on future trips to Bali."

We drove all the way to the vulcano and Besakih Temple, he was going all the way with us and trying to answer any questions we had and also taking photos. He was very patient and would not rush us anywhere. So we kinda had had a guide as well. His english was good and he would answer any 'stupid' question we had about temples, religion, culture, balinese ceremonies... really everything :)We are so happy that we did a tour with Ubud Friendly Driver and I would recommend it to everyone who is visiting Bali and wants to see a lot in a one day."

As we had requested, he took us to the rice terraces at Tegalalang, followed by visits to Gunung Kawi and, very memorably, Tirta Empul, where he showed us the local and respectful way to make offerings and ask blessings of the gods. My husband and are not religious people but we thoroughly enjoyed this experience, which was without pretension and very beautiful. We finished the day taking picture of Mount Batur. We very nearly just hired a taxi driver from the street in Ubud but are so pleased that we looked on the Internet and found Ubud Friendly Driver. Booking was very easy (we did it via Facebook) and we got exactly what we wanted. We feel so lucky to have met Gooday.

We visited Bali first time from 12th - 18th August and had hired the car for all 6 days from Astawa and his company for our trip starting from airport pickup to all sightseeing. We were a family of 5 with my wife and 3 children. We chose this based on the reviews on tripadvisor and we were pleasantly surprised to see that the drivers were even better than what we expected.June and Agung were our drivers most of the days except the airport pickup and Astawa was available on the phone for any queries etc all the time.The drivers were very good in English and all the time very attentive and it came to a situation where my 9 year old son will not have lunch or dinner without them. We kept on changing plans at times but they were quite co-operative and just followed our plan.The trip can be tricky in Bali due to no public transport but because of the drivers it looks like Bali will become our annual holiday destination.Thank you June, Agung and Astawa fdr providing such an excellent service and making this trip memorable We will visit Bali more often as the place is awesome and the people like you make it even better."

However last minute, i decided to go and did not regret it at all! We had Jun as our driver and he was so friendly and welcoming. Even though he was new, only having worked 3 months, he was very professional. We told him we wanted to see the temple, Ubud rice fields and coffee plantation and he made sure we saw it. He is a great photographer as well! He was very patient driving through the 2 hours traffic from Ubud to our hotel in Seminyak. Thank you again for the great tour and we definitely recommend!"

My partner and I were told to get a \"driver\" when we were in Bali, and as it was both our first trip we were unsure as to what a driver did, what we should look for, how much to pay and where to go. The usual things to worry about on a first trip. After reading many reviews on TripAdvisor, the choice started to become much clearer.We called Astawa from Ubud Friendly Drivers to check his availability and he was extremely friendly, gave expert advice, told us of areas we could go and how long the day would go for. On top of this, he advised us that he could take us the very next day! Without hesitation, we agreed.The day came and Astawa was very prompt, meeting us at our villa at 9am as agreed. Everywhere we visited was great with Astawa's company. Travel between the traditional dance, the waterfall, the coffee plantation, the silver factory, the traditional Balinese home and the volcano were all made possible by the comfort of Astawa's car which I would gladly have as my own!This trip was made possible by a local who shared his passion for his country and his career in tourism (as you will learn during your trip).We certainly recommend Ubud Friendly Driver and Astawa.Shannon & Jess in Adelaide!!"

We were expertly guided around with excellent knowledge of the area and things we saw by our guide as well as a fantastic explanation about the mother temple and the Hindu religion. Our guide took us for lunch to a great restaurant that over looked the volcano and took us to the coffee plantation as an extra where we got to see the 'Cat Poo' coffee. Nothing was too much trouble for our guide and he let us decide how long to spend at each location and what to do there. He stayed with us right through until 8pm seizure starting with us at 10am and was patient and kind. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to see a lot of Bali in one day and without an organised your where you basically make your own tour. Thank you again Astawa, Tracy and Nic (UK)"

As promised there was a driver (on Friday) to greet us at the airport and take us to our hotel (in Ubud) the day we arrived. The service to/from the airport was a very good price given the distance and time required for the transfer. We also arranged for private touring on Saturday and Sunday. Astawa was flexible with regard to schedule and our interests. He arrived promptly at the agreed upon time. He was very knowledgable about the area and local customs. We learned a lot about Bali that we had not known. His English is excellent so it was easy to communicate with him. The price was very reasonable. I'd highly recommend such a service to anyone visiting Bali. It is a luxury to be comfortably shuttled to various sites by a knowledgeable private guide. Astawa was also helpful in our selection of a hotel (the Maya Ubud Resort) which was an amazing place; one of the nicest places we stayed during our entire month long trip in Southeast Asia. Finally Astawa is very responsive to emails. We made all arrangements from the US by email and Astawa even trusted us without requiring a credit card deposit (which at first made me a little worried that maybe the booking wasn't that solidly confirmed)."

We visited a number of places - some of his recommendations and he was happy to meet our requests.I would recommend Kadek and Bali friendly drivers to anyone who travels to Bali and I would utilise their service again when we return.Thankyou so much Kadek and Astawa!!"

Also he did teach us many interesting things about the balinese life and culture.I strongly reccomend him for the job- booking a tour with Astawa in Bali - you won't regret it!"

He was responsive at the time of booking, flexible to our wants, punctual and flexible on the tour, and got us to the next resort, right when asked to be there. On top of everything he was a good friendly person that made us feel comfortable. He also had a nice car that he drove us around in.Then the tour and what we got to see... Was fantastic, from the rice terraces,to the holy springs temple, to the cat poo coffee farm, and the incredible monkey forest we packed it in but at a pace that was just about right! Anyone going to Bali should strongly consider Astawa and the Ubud friendly drivers to show them around!Thanks for a great day Astawa!"

I even went swimming at the Tegenungan waterfall and saw Mt Batur from afar. It was a packed day but I am only in Bali passing through for a few days so it was perfect for me! I chose the madness but this company will cater to your interests and needs. Overall, amazing day."

My wife and I visited Bali on our honeymoon, and were staying in Ubud for the first part of the trip, after a few days of seeing the local sites, we were looking to take a day trip and see more of the island. I did some research online, and found Astawa and his numerous great reviews. Astawa quickly responded to all of my emails, and we were quickly able to select an itinerary and pick-up time at our hotel.Astawa was waiting for us when we came down from breakfast. He was very friendly, professional, and excited to show us around his island. We had selected the Ubud-Volcano tour, but since we had already gone to the monkey forest, we skipped that. We followed the stops outlined on the website (Barong Dance/Batik Village/Silver Village/Painting Village/Wood Carver/Coffee Plantation/Volcano/Rice Terrace), but also went to a waterfall, a traditional Balinese house, and stopped for some tasty lunch. The volcano and coffee plantation were my favorite stops, but the entire trip was a lot of fun. Astawa made sure to let us know what was up next, and was flexible about working with the time we had left to maximize what we could see. He is a fantastic driver, which comes in very handy with some of the \"challenging\" roads that wind through the island. He is also very knowledgeable about everything Bali, and was able to answer the stream of questions that we had as the day progressed, and gave his own spin on the stops that we made.I, like the many others who have left reviews, highly recommend booking a tour with Astawa when in Bali, he truly is the Ubud Friendly Driver!"

Not only is the value amazing, but my driver really went above and beyond with creating an itinerary that interested me instead of following the usual touristy agenda. As a solo traveler, my driver was a great companion as he accompanied me during my visit to the rice terraces, waterfall, Tanah lot, and dinner in Ubud. In addition, I REALLY wanted to see Tanah Lot at sunset and my driver made sure that we made it there on time - and we did! We even passed along several tour buses on the way back (they missed the sunset) so again, booking a private tour is MUCH better than a tour group because you're not waiting on anybody! Thank you to my driver and Astawa for following up after my trip to make sure I was happy - excellent customer service!! Book with Astawa, you won't regret it!"

First off, I would like to say that Astawa is a VERY responsive to my inquiries and emails which made booking with him an ease when I was still in the states. First ride was from Kuta to Ubud. Our driver, Kadek, was on time and had no problem finding our hotel in Kuta. Good AC in the car. When we asked him to take us to a lunch spot before we got settled into the hotel, we stopped by a local Balinese restaurant mostly catered to tourists, but it still had great food. Second day ,we had Komang for our driver and he was also on time, his English was very good and was very flexible with what we wanted to do. We wanted to do temples and skipped some other venues and he was very accommodating. He was able to give us history about some of the temples and educated us on the Balinese culture. Komang took us to another Balinese restaurant and we was introduced to the Betutu Bebek (Komang's favorite dish) and so is mine now. We had a great time and no complaints whatsoever. Bottom line: Would highly recommend these guys. Very responsive and Astawa also texted me afterwards to make sure things went well. I would definitely use them again if I went back. These guys are definitely trustworthy."

This allowed us to really enjoy the temple and witness local people using the holy bathing place. We then did a local market to see daily life. The next day we gave him a sleep in and got a 6.30am pick up. Again we got to see Elephant Temple in peace and quiet. Astawa is a very good, safe driver.

Then he took us to Pura Ulun Danu Bratan, the lake temple, where there were celebrations for the full moon and we finished the tour with a coffee tasting. Kadek also gave us few tips on other things to see and places where to eat. Very good service.

Had only a few attractions in mind, Astawa was able to expand my itinerary to include a few more \"must visit\" places which is along the way. We all know how taxing can it be to be stuck on the traffic on route to the attractions, but we do not feel any awkwardness having Astawa to take care of us along the way.

His name isI Made Wardana on the stand out the front of Honeymoom Guest House.JI. Srwedari, Tegallantang, Ubud.Made is a great driver, calm and not too fast. I asked a the hotel what price I should expect to pay and Made was always agreeable to that price. I think it is wise to agree on a price before you travel. He was very polite and he really looked after me, crossing me across busy streets. I was a passenger in Made's taxi several times over my stay. One day we went on a tour for 3 hours. We agreed on an hourly rate. Made gave me a great insight into how locals live and their culture. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Made as a driver, particularly if you are travelling alone in Ubud."

After a short Google search Tripadvisor gave us a big help by all great reviews regarding UFD - Astawa Nyoman. And he was even above these reviews. As two girls traveling in such a far and exotic place we completely felt safe which is the main concern when you leave home. We asked him by email for a travel package: airport pick-up late in the evening, day trip around Ubud, night trip to Lovina for the sunrise and dolphins, half day trip from Lovina to Kuta with stops to visit the area and when we stayed in Kuta we also asked him for a driver to drive us to Uluwatu. He and his driver Made was always in time, answered in a very fast and direct way to all our questions and everything went according to the plans that he did help us to make. The day trip with him around Ubud was an amazing one. We did a lot of activities for one day but never felt tired: Barong dance, craftsmen villages, waterfall and holy water, coffee plantation, volcano, famous rice terraces of Tegalalang. All his proposals were very good options and nobody really stressed us with buying. It was a perfect mixture of touristic and real local taste. We really felt with him the truth from the saying: travel is the only expense that makes you richer. So, thanks a lot Astawa Nyoman for all you did for us, including the fact that we now join tripadvisor! It was an amazing holiday and we will always remember you as a friend of trust."

We had Astawa as our driver and he was great. Our guide up the volcano was brilliant and the trip itself was amazing!!Because we had such a good experience with the drivers we book for them to drop us off at the airport when we left, as the price was cheaper than booking through our hotel and cheaper than booking on the streets. We would definitely recommend this company. We have said we will be going back to Bali at some point and we will be booking trips and transport with Astawa and the team."

They were both good with helping us to plan out our days.Astawa also helped us making bookings while we were out seeing Ubud.Would not have any problem recommending Astawa, Ubud Friendly Driver to family or friends going to Ubud."

My husband and I had a really short stay in Bali and decided to hire a driver for 2 days so that we could get the most out of our sightseeing experience. I found Ubud Friendly Driver through research and reviews through various web sites. I am so happy to have gone with this company:) Astawa the owner, personally responded to my emails and questions right away and we were all booked and set for the 2 day excursions. I met his wonderful brother-in-law Komang who took us to the places that we wanted to see. He gave us the cultural and historical background for all the temples and land marks that we visited. On the first day we visited 4 temples, a waterfall, had lunch, and did a little bit if trekking through the fields of Ubud. On the second day we went to the elephant safari, 2 more temples, and had other exploration of the rice fields in a nearby town. The car was clean, safe, and comfortable. Komang is a wonderful driver and it relaxed me to know I was in good hands especially with the crazy driving in Bali. He was always alert, kind, charming, and most importantly helpful. He even helped with suggestions of places to visit and the order in which to do them so that we would enjoy the maximum benefits. We felt safe and comfortable the entire time and started a wonderful friendship with Komang. We miss him. Without Ubud friendly driver we would not have been able to experience all of these sights in the short amount of time that we had. We never felt rushed at any of the stops and it was good to know that there was someone there to look out for us while we were in a foreign country. My husband and I fell in love with Bali and will definitely be back. Hopefully next time we can stay longer and we will definitely use the services of Ubud Friendly Driver. Thank you Komang and Astawa."

We only had a couple of days in Ubud so wanted to get as much diversity of experience as possible. Not only did he deliver by showing us some highlights, but he also patiently answered dozens of questions about life in Ubud, the culture, why there were 100 ducks in a field, how to catch an eel in the rice paddies, and anything else we were curious about. True highlights for us included the water temple, coffee plantation, and rice paddies. Although these would have been fun to visit on our own, Astawa provided the back story to make them truly special. We also appreciated his honesty about what was good, not so good, and not worth visiting. We consider this money well spent and a good friend made in the process."

We went on TripAdvisor for assistance where we found this guy. We contacted him on Facebook with immediately response. After a short conversation everything was set for the next day.We were picked up in the morning at a location (and a time) of our choice. We then chatted and confirmed what we wanted to see. He was really good at making a realistic plan for the day from our wishes. At most locations he joined us and guided us and told stories with really good and solid english. He was very friendly and it felt like he really wanted us to have a great time, and we did so!The next day we went with one of his employees for a taxi drive to Candidasa for around the same price as a metered taxi. Unfortuneatly i accidentally dropped my GoPro-camera in the car. When I realized i forgot it there (several hours later), we contacted him and told him the situation. He was fast replying that they had it and that they could bring it to us. Since we had to go to Ubud the very next day, we just waited a single day, where they brought it to us for free. It was so nice to have such a friendly and honest taxi-driver. Huge shout out to him and his employee. Thank you for giving us an amazing time in Ubud :-)Visited from Denmark"

Komang was assigned to me as my driver for the excursion. He arrived on time, the car was clean, and as a single female traveler I felt completely safe with him the whole time. He was friendly and polite, and I appreciated his calm and quiet demeanor. Since arriving in Ubud was my primary objective for hiring the company, they earn 3 stars. However if I was reviewing this as a tour company it would have been one star.The \"tour\" is a complete joke. As a well-traveled individual hoping to get an authentic experience of what more rural parts of Bali had to offer, I was incredibly disappointed. Instead of being brought to fun and unique sites for authentic Bali experiences, I was ushered from tourist trap to tourist trap, and accosted by high pressure sales people pushing coffee, jewelry, and wood carvings for appalling prices. They will tell you are being taken to wood carvers for \"demonstrations\" of how things are made in Bali. This is a lie and you are being swindled. It was only after I put my foot down and demanded a change in agenda that things got better. We stopped at a water fall and rice terrace, but ultimately the highlight was having a quick lunch at a small cafe and hearing about my driver's village. I was really sad when realizing how much time was wasted at the tourist traps and wished I had demanded a change earlier instead of hoping things would improve. If you want to earn kickbacks fine, but at least take me to an authentic or small scale operation where I can benefit the local economy as opposed to what were obviously tourist abusing conglomerates taking advantage of elderly western travelers that are inexperienced abroad. In addition, since my return I have been harassed via Facebook by the company owner to write a review. While I understand reviews are critical to the success of small businesses, I do not appreciate pushy and disrespectful communication techniques to achieve what is ultimately a one sided objective. Would I hire them again? Maybe. If I need a ride to the airport."

Always on time and willing to go the extra mile to make their customers happy. I'd call both of them friends, as well.

Astawa provided insight into some of the places on my list, which was too long for one day) so that I could decide which places I'd like to go. I have a somewhat bad leg, and he was considerate to let me know that a couple of the places I had on my list involved hundreds of stairs. Throughout the day he drove me through villages and rural areas, explaining what daily life was like for a Balinese family, and happily answering my thousand questions. Any time I wanted to take a picture, he was willing to pull the car over. I am traveling by myself, so it was great to have such a friendly person to spend the day with... much more than just a driver. Thank you Astawa!"

Both days we were driven to all of the locations we asked for and more.... Very professional and very friendly. Astawa was fantastic and his knowledge was exceptional. He provided all the answers to our questions and showed us places we would never of thought of. The service is first class and we were provided with water and cold towels during our journeys. We had a wonderful time and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend his services to anyone who is visiting Bali. Thanks so much for all your help and patience."

Mati is the man. He is so cool, easy and kind. He was an excellent historian and was patient with all of our questions about Bali and culture. We had an agenda on our journey from Kuta to Ubud and we did it all and then lots more thanks to the additional places we went for three days; we were tired but it was worth it all. We were picked from our hotel in Kuta, driven to Ubud and the surrounding areas until being delivered back to our hotel 3 full days later. Worth the price and peace of mind. Highly Recommend."

Never regret the decision, we had a very comfortable & safe journey through out the two days tour.Astawa was busy so he arranged Made to drive & guide us around. Made spoke good English, very patient & accommodating.He pick us up from airport, then to Uluwatu, bluepoint beach and Jimbaran beach for seafood dinner before heading to our hotel in Ubud. That was quite late already at 7pm but he never show a sign of impatience. On our way back, my friend need to go use the toilet urgently. He was helpful enough to stop at a convenience store for my friend to use the toilet.The next day, Made was punctual to pick us up to an art, culture & nature tour in Ubud. We watched the Barong & Kris dance, visited the Batik & silver craft village, coffee plantation, waterfall & Tegallalang rice terrace. It was a great learning experience.I will recommend Astawa & his team to my friends & engage them on my next trip to Bali.Thank you Astawa & Made for making this trip a wonderful & most memorable one in Bali.Tip: befriend Bali Driver in facebook & facebook message him to arrange your tour. He responded fast & promptly to your messages."

Since most of us are first timers in Bali, he helped us arrange our daily journey itinerary and recommends the places to visit in Bali. He speaks English well and explain to us in detail from A to Z the history of the places that we visited. To sum up, it was a good experience and we enjoyed our holidays in Ubud with him around. Highly recommended to you if you need someone to bring you around Bali. Two thumbs up!"

The main reason i went to Bali this time around is to join the Bali Marathon 2015 event (Held on 30th August 2015). Since this is the first time for some of my friends, we decided to come early and have some sigh seeing before the event. We arrived at Bali on 27th August 2015 and stayed at Ubud for the next 2 days. My friend contacted Astawa and arranged all our programs during our stay in Ubud with him before we visited Bali.We arrived at the airport at night. Astawa waited at the hall with a big sign of my friend's name, which i thought very thoughtful of him. There are a lot of tour guides at the arrival hall but we easily spotted him without problem.Our tour started the next day. On the first day, Astawa drove us to Taman Ayun, Ulun Danu Temple, Jatiluwih Rice Terrace and finally dropped us at the palace temple. He is a skilled driver. We experienced no casualties along the way to all the places that we had visited. I found him very informative and knowledgeable. Clearly, he knows well about the culture, religion and history of the temples and Ubud in general. He spoke good English, very attentive and answered all our questions.The next day was where the fun began. He drove us to see Barong Dance, lunch at Kintamani with the stunning view of Mount Batur, tasted different kind of coffee and other drinks of Bali product at coffee plantation, tasted the famous Luwak Coffee too while we're there and join the local for cleansing at Tirta Empul Temple at Tampaksiring. Astawa in a word is a jovial guy; friendly, joyful, sociable and outgoing. He can attune to our craziness and loudness, tolerate with our jokes and sometime giving his own joke as well. He is generous with smiles and laughter.Overall, it was a pleasure to meet Astawa. It was a very pleasant start for the first 2 days of our stay in Bali. Personally, i felt he brought more than just a great experience, he bring Bali close to the heart. His service is excellent. Highly recommended to everyone who wanted to have a tour around Ubud."

Even though on the day, the Bali Marathon and Kite Festival both seemed to be conspiring to make Astawa\u2019s effort a marathon one, he never faltered - he will go out of his way to look after you. He picked us up without us having too much in mind for the day. We gave him a rough idea of what we wanted to achieve and all his recommendations proved to be excellent. We covered a lot in one day with the views from the coffee plantation in his beautiful home town of Ubud at dusk being an absolute star. The coffee is worth the trip alone, mind you. It was a long day on the roads due to two major annual events being on, but the day was a standout and flew by. This of course was helped by the interesting, intriguing and informative conversations we had throughout with Astawa. What ever you want to do, he knows exactly where to take you. We would highly recommend Astawa\u2019s services in a heartbeat!"

First day we found him waiting ready for us in our Nusa Dua hotel lobby ready to take us up to Ubud for a full day tour before dropping us off at our new hotel which by some happy coincidence happened to be situated in his village and next to his cafe. He was a safe, patient and talkative driver throughout who let us dictate where we wanted to see in Ubud, as well as making his own suggestions along the way. We mentioned that we hadn't had breakfast and that we wanted to try roasted suckling pig (must try) and so Astawa found us a nice local cafe and ate with us. After touring some of the sites of Ubud we arrived at the Holy Spring Water Temple, a must visit. Astawa had even thought to bring us additional clothing so that we conformed to the dress code. He guided us round, providing us with lots of information and demonstrated to us what to do with the holy water. After we were taken to a coffee plantation which we loved and were able to see and buy lots of Bali's agricultural products. Again, Astawa proved himself to be a great guide, patient and informative. Next we headed for lunch overlooking Mount Batur, something we almost missed as we were still full from breakfast. Whatever you do, don't miss a lovely reasonably priced all you can eat buffet sat under a blanket outside overlooking one of the best views you will have ever seen. After lunch we headed for the Ubud famous rice terraces which also didn't disappoint.During our first day with Astawa he helped us arrange our following day with him. After learning that we intended to do the night trek up Mount Batur he offered to pick us up at 3am, drive us there, and provide us with a breakfast box. We took him up on this offer, he picked us up on time (despite the long hours and lack of sleep he must endure) and waited for 5 hours whilst we trekked up and down the volcano. Afterwards he arranged for us to go white water rafting. Although the water was quite slow on the day we went, this too was very enjoyable and the staff helped make it! We had wanted to go ATV riding after this but due to the lack of sleep the night before we decided against this and Astawa took us back to our hostel. That night we went to his AA Cafe for some lovely vegetarian food and an organic health juice.All in all, it was a pleasure to meet Astawa, his service is splendid and was a great way to be introduced to Ubud. Despite his long hours he does not overcharge, nor does he let them affect his mood."

He took us to the Monkey forest, the Art villages. We had lunch in a restaurant with a perfect view to the volcano - although the view was breath taking, the buffet was not the best. After lunch we went to the Coffee plantations, the Tirta Empul temple - through which he guided us - and we finished the tour at the rice terrace. Throughout the day, Nyoman was very cooperative and careful to our needs. He adjusted the program based on what interests us most. I strongly recommend him for customized private tours."

Made, the brother, drove me around Bali for 3 days. I gave him an itinerary and he managed the routes and schedule perfectly!I was traveling alone but Made was great at talking and we had many great conversations, making the time it took traveling as interesting as the places I saw. I realized that to see Bali, transportation is an absolute necessity. I loved having a local to be able to explain the surroundings, the culture, answer my questions, and give advice for the best things to see. Because of Made, I didn't just see Bali. I could actually learn so much about what I was seeing and take so much knowledge home with me to share with friends and family. The decision to hire a driver turned out to be the best decision I made for this trip. I had some extra time before my flight and he suggested white water rafting. It was the most exciting way to end my trip, the perfect suggestion. If you hire Ubud Friendly Driver, I'm sure you will find so much more than a driver. You will find a dependable, knowledgeable, friendly, funny guide through Bali who will give you so much more of a memorable holiday. I will definitely hire them again for my next trip. Another big thank you for the fabulous trip!!"

There are many positive reviews here for you to see, so you cannot go wrong booking this driver. However you may not actually get Astawa; on the second day of our booking he arranged his brother-in-law Made to meet us - he was very good and we were not disappointed (actually my wife had a slight preference for Made and for me it was Astawa). This 'book and switch' is fairly typical in Bali so just be prepared for it and 'go with the flow' and enjoy your holiday.Also note that you will pay around 40% more for getting a quality driver like Astawa, so if all you want is transport in an average taxi or van with a driver that is just OK, then there is no need to book Astawa, but you don't want that do you?! So go ahead and book Ubud Friendly Driver, and if he is already booked he will arrange another driver who will also be super.Final comment: If you do research and know where you want to go (places to visit), write this down, show it and get an agreement of time and price. This is true for booking any driver. If you want to leave it all to your driver, then accept where he takes you without complaints or regrets but with gratitude and enjoyment."

On the next day Astawa himself took us for a tour from Ubud to some local craftsmen (who of course are actively selling their silver or wooden arts, which might someone feel too pushy), a traditional Balinese house, the water-temple, Tegalalang rice fields and the Batur crater rim. Overall a very nice and extremely recommendable tour. In addition, we felt safe every single moment."

We had no idea what to do and where to go in Bali but his experience gave us all we want. He told us the places to visit and activities to do in Bali. His charge is reasonable and lower compare to many drivers.His planning is awesome which help us to visit as many attractions as we can in a day (We visited most of Bali attractions in 5 days). We took time at each attraction and Astawa waited for us patiently. There are few days where we spent more than 10 hours a day with him without extra charge. He never sent us to place that we wouldn't want to visit. When we wanted something, he will always give us the best he can. I will definitely book his service again when I visit Bali the next time!"

We then went on to the usual temples as well as a plantation and bought some raw cacao which I'm drinking as I write this!! From there we went to check the volcano out from a really lovely restaurant. Great vantage point.Asawat is very reliable, helpful and friendly and speaks great English.

He speaks very good english and has a very comfortable, air conditioned car to travel in.He only took us to the places we wanted to go and also showed us a few new things, we hadn't expected to see, but loved.It was a very long day for him, but he never hurried us and was extremely polite and friendly throughout the day. We were even lucky enough to visit his own family Warung and experienced fantastic food and amazing fresh juices at his restraurant in Ubud. I recommend you stop in at some point throughout the day.

It was a long day of driving for him but there were no complaints about the time it took us to visit all the places we wanted. He is a safe and patient driver and his vehicle is air conditioned and very comfortable, and he even provides cold water bottles and ice cold towels to help cool off. We arranged for Astawa to meet us again from our resort in Ubud on 2 other occasions during our holiday, and visited the rice terraces, holy spring temple and Mount Batur. We were also delighted to be invited to visit his family Warung in Ubud where we got to relax, enjoy delicious food and health drinks, and take in the village atmosphere whilst overlooking the picturesque rice paddies nearby.We compared his rates to that quoted at our resort, and his prices are very reasonable for the amount of time he drives, and the service he provides. We highly recommend the Bali Friendly Driver and look forward to our next Bali holiday and meeting Astawa again!"

We researched the places we wanted to visit and Astawa was more then happy to take us to these places, he even added a few of his own to show us.We all had an enjoyable day exploring Ubud and eating lunch overlooking the volcano.Astawa was full of infomation and very patient with our boys who had many questions. It was no problem if we wanted to make an unplanned stop. We asked Astawa to drop us off at Jimbaran Bay for dinner which he did happily, he was willing to stay and wait for us but we insisted that he go home as the day had started at 8am. We will be using UFD when we go back to Bali."

We chose this driver because of his good feedback on TripAdvisor but what a mistake! 1) He quoted 350k for the ride from Kuta to Ubud but then charged us 400k (the hotel fee would have been 300k). We discussed with him where we wanted to go ans on the first day we arranged to go on an ATV ride & Swimming with Dolphins - he had rung them but when we arrived they said we would have to wait 3 hours which I'm sure he knew but he preferred to not be driving and save money. 2) We never given the $80 deposit refund for the ride we didn't take. 3) We were then taken to the 'touristy' places he preferred (presumably because not too far and perhaps he gets a commission?) rather than the scenic places we had arranged to be taken. 4) When we went to eat we ended up at high end restaurants he liked rather than the style we told him we preferred and he ordered the most expensive dishes for himself on our bill. 5) The next day we clearly specified the exact places we wanted to go but after being taken to two more tourist traps that we disliked (instead of the places we'd been promised) he then wouldn't even take us to a local restaurant to eat and insisted we wait till we got back to Ubud after 3.30pm for lunch (presumably because he wanted to eat at another expensive restaurant!) so we just cut the trip short and from then on went sight seeing on a scooter - much cheaper, nicer and we saw the real country villages and views we liked. 6) He even had the audacity to tell us that he liked to have fun with his female clients and that he was a 'player' but that his wife (who was very sweet, beautiful & 6 months pregnant) didn't know - not sure if we were meant to be impressed or if he thought my fiancee might like to have fling with him! 7) His charges at 700k for a 4 to 5 hour day trip are way more expensive than other equivalents - we thought we'd get better service but we learned a lesson for the future.The time we wasted was more important than money we wasted so if you decide to use this driver our suggestion is be very very careful unless you're happy to just be taken to the tourist spots he chooses. Other than this Ubud was absolutely fabulous and the Balinese people so friendly and we will return many times in the future. Beautiful scenery, great food, great yoga and top notch massages!"

We felt as if we were touring with a friend and we learned a lot regarding Bali culture and how the locals live. We stayed in Ubud outskirts and Astawa's village was right by our hotel. He is local and super authentic and proud of his culture.During the first day, we did the Volcano tour and very much enjoyed our experience. Astawa drove us around and gave us an overview of the attractions. However, he gave us enough privacy and did not follow us around to all places, which we very much preferred,The the 2nd day we went to the remaining Ubud attractions. The Balinese dance was good - it was more of a theater than a dance. If this is the only dance/theater you will see, I would recommend it. Otherwise Ubud Palace had great performances. Also, the visit to the silver, wood carving and silver villages was really a drive by with a stop by big stores where sales people follow you around with quite a bit of sales pressure. If you are interested in buying- definitely worth it, otherwise I would skip. I really liked the jewelry/silver store- bought great hand made items at a really good price. Make sure you negotiate a discount by of least 50% the msrp.On the 3rd day, Astawa had to go to a ceremony so he referred the booking to his brother-in-law Made who took us to some temples and beaches before our drop off at Nusa Dua. I would highly recommend Made too- great English and super friendly. If Astawa is unavailable, I would not hesitate to use Made.Overall, great experience. Will highly recommend Astawa and use him again on our next trip : )"

Although the day started off with torrential rain, he managed the trip well to go to all the indoor attractions first, and to our luck, the rain stopped after lunch and we managed to round off the trip with the remaining sights. Definitely one of the highlights of the trip to Bali and we knew Astawa truly loves Ubud and Bali. Hope to get in touch again next time we visit Bali.

I have no hesitation in highly recommending Astawa - you won't regret it!"

He was recommended to us by a friend who has used his services a lot before; and trusts him highly to take care of his pregnant wife even on solo trips also to acquire furniture.Not only that but he is very knowledgeable, helpful, relaxed, friendly, and in tune with individual needs.We did an ubud tour from seminyak and it was a very long, full but fun day. We mainly went to look at art galleries and wood furniture/carvings but also got to see some fabulous home made jewellery as well squeezed in temples and rice terraces. We ate at a very tasty 'crispy duck' place that I would highly recommend... And had some amazing fresh coffee later on.Although it rained, we still did do the rice terraces, but only saw local family temples as driving through ubud due to running out of time (14 hours from pickup to drop off!)All our furniture requirements were filled, we also got a great wood carving and some amazing art! Myself and my wife had a really goodtime.Nyoman (Newmann) Ur the best bro!"

            "review": "Excellent personal tour guide. I booked Nyoman Astawa because of the reviews on tripadvisor. He was everything his customers on trip advisor said he was. I booked him for two days in December.On the first day, he picked us up at the Stones hotel at Kuta at exactly 9am as scheduled. In fact he was a bit early but we were still in our rooms getting ready. After the introductions, we planned our itinerary. We decided to go cultural and visit Ubud and the surroundings. He was informative and knowledgable about the customs and habits of the locals. He took us out all the way until 10pm at night and still charges us 600k.The only bad thing was that we were supposed to visit a barung show on the second morning but when we reached there, it was closed. There was only one show at 930am so we were not able to catch it again. Other than that, it was the same as the first day, except he probably caught a cold from the rain on the first day, as he was sniffling a bit and he looked tired. I found out later he reached home at 12am and left the next day at 6am!All in all, it was enjoyable and nice to have a personal guide for our tour of Bali. I highly recommend Nyoman Astawa if you are looking for a tour guide / driver."

Astawa also speaks very good English, and is able to explain everything we were seeing. He is very knowledgeable about Bali, and he loves the culture there. My wife and I generally take vacations day by day, so we never really knew where we were going to stay the next night until the day before. It was easy to organize anything we wanted with Astawa while we were there, because he responds very quickly to emails and Facebook Messenger. He is also very patient. We never felt rushed with him waiting while we explored everything. I would highly recommend Astawa as a driver/tour guide in Bali."

We ended up our day at Jimbaran beach, we had seafood with a beautiful and romantic view. On the second day, we went to the rice field and street market. Then we tried the roasted pig for lunch. After lunch, Astawa brought us to a wonderful spa. We were relaxed after the massage. Then we went to the Uluwatu temple to watch sunset . Astawa is really kind and friendly.

Before arriving in Indonesia I sent him a detailed list of all the places of interest that me and my girlfriend wanted to visit. We didn\u2019t have many days at our disposal, since we had to leave for Lombok four days later. He picked us up at the airport with an impeccable punctuality and, to our great surprise, he had already prepared for us, the program of visits for the following days. Ubud is a great place that every traveler who comes to Bali must visit. I would strongly recommend staying there for at least 3 days. If it wasn\u2019t for Astawa, we would never be able to visit all these fantastic places that have made our vacation a magical experience. He is a very kind person, friendly and very informed on all the history of his nation. I firmly believe that anyone, who has benefited from of its services, must reward a person like Astawa, that in the few days of vacation of each traveler, is able to convey to us all the fantastic and unbelievable things that Bali has to offer. Thanks again for your valuable services. I hope to return soon to Bali."

Astawa took us to this amazing place for dinner and we all loved it. What we found even more surprising was where he took us for lunch- a restaurant overlooking a volcano- with an even more incredible view. One of the best I have ever seen.

His car is late model, spacious and very comfortable, Astawa provided drinking water, cold refreshment towels after hot activities and his vehicle even has wifi! We wanted to go white water rafting in Ubud, Astawa suggested his friends rafting company which was helpful cause there are so many and he even got us a discount.

Really nice guy, very helpful, trustworthy, speaks English well, and is very knowledgeable about local customs.We hired him for a day (after reading reviews here), and then later hired him for a second day. So, I think that speaks volumes in terms of our recommendation.We were travelling with my two children (age 9, 10) and Astawa was great with them, getting them involved in experiencing Balinese life, trying out playing the gamelan, etc.I've hired a number of drivers in Bali over the years who I wouldn't hire again. Next time we go back to Bali, we'd hire Astawa again!"

We had a fantastic day visiting the coffee plantations, rice paddy fields, silver processing, art work, wood carving, holy spring and finishing up with some traditional local dancing.

Myself and my sister recently spent some time in Ubud and we were so lucky to find Imin Nyoman to take us around. We met him by chance of just jumping in his cb back to our hotel from town and he was so lovely, friendly, so informative about Bali and had a wonderful sense of humour. We booked him to pick us up the next morning to take us to some attractions. He was there waiting with a big smile, we wanted to get a specific wood carving made and he went above and beyond to find us the place that would get us exactly what we wanted. All we planned after that was to go to the Safari Park but after chatting away with him about his life in Ubud he ended up taking us to meet Ketut Liyer from Eat Pray Love fame and have our fortunes read with him and see abit of where the film was made. He also took us to Gianyar night markets which is not something a lot of tourists do and we felt very safe with him as this was his home town in Ubud. He helped me booked my trek up Mt Batur and we also booked him to take us from Ubud back to the airport when we left. He was a wonderful guide, great conversation. lots of fun and so full of information. He had a genuine good heart and we feel like we really made a good friend in him. Im certain your experience with Imin will be the same.It was about $50 from 8am-5pm and we waited for us at all attractions. About $25 from Ubud to the Airport.Imin NyomanHP: 081 311 594 627or : 085 238 208 820fb: nyoman_imin@yahoo.comemail: nyoman_imin@yahoo.com"

            "review": "#1 driver in the whole of Bali!. The driver, Astawa, grew up in Ubud, Gianyar and contrary to popular belief that he only knows how to drive around Ubud, he knows about all the places in the wonderful island of Bali. Compared to other drivers who are not locals, Astawa knows everything about the culture and practices and festivals about Bali. Whatever questions we asked him, he could tell us the details. For example, during the trip we saw many cars with offerings placed on the exterior of the cars. He explained the reason behind this practice and it was really amazing to learn about their culture. After all, no one will know the culture of a country better than its own locals.I first got into contact with Astawa through Facebook. You can also find him there by searching for \"Bali driver\". He is very tech savvy and is always online. I added him as a friend and within minutes, we were arranging the itinerary for the day out. As I didn't really know where I wanted to go, Astawa offered several places. I refused those places which I didn't have interest in or had gone previously. Since he is so familiar with Bali, he offered even more other places which I could go. He is flexible with wherever you want to go, and we even changed the itinerary on the actual day.In the end, we went to the batik factory, wood carving places, traditional compound ( only one left in Bali!), holy spring temple, coffee and tea plantations and lastly to watch the fire and kecak dance. A tip for everyone is that whichever place needs entrance fees, it is only applicable to us tourists. You don't need to consider fees for Astawa! oh and since Astawa offered to go to the temple and it is necessary for us to wear sarongs into the temple, Astawa has kindly provided the sarongs for us to wear! You would have to pay to rent a sarong, but Astawa was thoughtful enough to provide them for us, absolutely clean!As we went around and got sweaty, Astawa provided bottles of cold mineral water and cold wet towel. It was simply amazing. Oh and not to forget, he also provides wifi usage anywhere u go! I had to send urgent messages back home and I could have access to the internet whenever I want ! I had such a wonderful day out with him that at the end of the day, I felt that I am even more attached to Bali and even now, I can still remember the places I went to on the day out with him! He is a very kind and jovial driver who knows how to respect the privacy his clients need and he knows when he can joke around.There is nothing else better than that entire day out with Astawa during our entire 5 day trip. We were living in Nusa Dua, a good 2 hours away from Ubud where he lives but he came all the way for us. Although his tour was supposed to end in 10 hours, he drove us around and ended up spending 16 hours before reaching home again, without imposing an additional charge on us.Though he brings us to tourist places, he never forces us to buy anything. He is just a kind and considerate driver who shows you everything about Bali, without being pushy at all! I will definitely engage him again.You will not regret your choice of choosing Astawa as your driver, I can guarantee that! He is not the second in Ubud. He is the number one driver for the entire Bali island!"

At the end he brought us to the airport.To anyone who is going to take a car trip through Bali - be sure Astawa will help you to do it in best manner.Thank you, Astawa, for nice time."

We made use of his services again upon our return to Bali in February 2014 and discovered on this occasion that in addition to being a wonderful guide and prudent driver he also happens to be an accomplished painter, musician and theatrical performer. Our only concern is that he is likely to become so popular with visitors that we may be unable to book him during our next trip to Bali."

We have been to Bali on a number of occassions, and have had our share of recommended drivers, but Astawa IS the king of them ALL. Firstly even before we had left we had comunicated with Astawa as to our prefrences of types of sites to visit. He put together an itinnery to make the most of each area's attractions and our time. He also put forward other places of interest that were off the beaten track, in line with our interest in the more spiritual and real Bali. His car was in great shape, very clean and more than comfortable for large people and we always felt safe in the chaotic Bali roads. Then there was the extras he supplied (which we never had before) like cold bottled water supplied for each trip - an extra cost saving and issues of keeping ones water cold throughout the day, - those wonderfull cold facetowels with their refreshing lemongrass fragrance - just a god send after our market/hiking expeditions. He also supplied the sarongs (clean)( which one needs to wear at Temples) saving us once again hiring costs and not having to carry things around, not to mention the umberellas for those wet down pours. Now if all this wasn't enough Astawa had a great command of english, and an ever better sense of humor, he was able to explain the history and culture, and was very paitent in teaching us some very usefull Baliness phrases. When we visited the markets, which can be quite intimidating , Astawa stayed close to the ladies to ensure our safty, we found this particularly comforting, as did the males in our group as we did have a tendancy to stray. Then just to top things off Astawa recomended places to eat, the places that he knew had a higher standard of cleanlyness. Oh yes Astawa works on reall time not Bali time, he was always punctual, happy and smiling, very flexable and accomodating. All in all, I think our taxi and tour drivers could take lessons from Astawa on what service REALLY IS.... need I say more. If u dont use Astawa you'll be sorry!!! :) I cant tell you all what a diffrence it made to our stay in Bali. I will not be able to speak highly enough of this gentle caring young man who treated us with so much respect and dignity. Your the BEST Astawa thank-you (sok smal sum pie nuntee)(if u can translate this very poor attempt in saying thank-you and see you later)"

If you are looking for an exceptional safe, honest and knowledgeable driver, no need to look any further, this guy is the one with a well maintained, roomy and comfortable vehicle! Astawa or Nyoman was our driver for a number of days and took us on a Bail experience from the mountains to the sea, from sleepy little villages to temples and very special places; sometimes along roads no tourist has seen. Having visited Bali on four previous occasions this was the first time that the \u2018real Bali\u2019 truly unfolded for us, through him. Following conversations about different plants, herbs and fruits along the way he was even kind enough to invite us to a hands on cooking demonstration with local produce with his mum and his sisters in the family compound, it was fantastic, both the food we produced and the family\u2019s friendly interaction. Astawa was also a mine of information and gave us hints on everything from where to eat, cultural expectations and ceremonial do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to history, places to source items and where, when and when not to bargain. His concerned and protective guidance was invaluable and he was always there with icy cold perfumed face towels and complimentary bottled water. Two of us had a nagging cough so he sourced peeled Galangal for us to chew which fixed it. If you are interested in the spiritual side he is also an artist, musician and lead character dancer, blessed and sanctioned by the high priest to perform in local ceremonies. These are not tourist displays but personal devotion and beliefs which are very special to him. You can find his details etc. on his web site as well http://www.driver-ubud.com/index.php"

We went to Bali for a friend's wedding and with many other commitments our time was limited. Communicating through Facebook, we arranged some available dates for us to do some touring around Bali. Astawa arrived promptly at our accommodation and patiently waited an hour for us to finish getting ready, which gave us a chance to chat and plan our day with the aid of his maps and brochures. Astawa easily customised our trip so we could see exactly what we wanted within the time we had. We were travelling with our 19 month old son and our day was made even more enjoyable as Astawa is excellent with children. The two of them bonded immediately and he helped out with our son throughout the day without being asked, which gave us a chance to wonder off a bit and take photos etc.Astawa's English is very good and he's full of useful knowledge about the island and was able to answer all of our questions, no matter how random they were. The quality and cleanliness of his vehicle is excellent and his driving was safe \u2013 something we were concerned with when travelling with a young toddler.Additionally, Astawa brought along complimentary water bottles and cold towels to help us to deal with the heat and humidity. Although we didn't use it, he kindly offered to use his phone as a wifi hotspot if we needed to check Facebook, Instagram etc.My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our day with Astawa and can fully recommend him to anyone who needs someone to explore more of this great island."

All I had to do was email him( Wifi is every where but I had no phone) and he would be there within 15 minutes. If I booked him for the day, he was always early. He was my sunshine in Ubud.

We used Astawa's service three times on our trip and were sad to say goodbye to him. I would definitely recommend him to anyone visiting Bali who is after a knowledgeable and friendly driver."

It wasnt like most tours that have fixed sights to see but you might not like but have to go.Overall Neyo more than impressed us and I would recommend 100%. Ignore the bad reviews.

My sister and I recently stayed in Ubud where we visited the healer \u2013 Pakman \u2013 who contacted Ubud based Nyoman when we required a driver to take us back to our accommodation. We were very fortunate indeed that he did! Our first impressions were of a very polite, obliging, humble, professional young man with a happy face and beautiful smile and who had an exceptional command of the English language.We decided to engage him then and there for a tour we had been contemplating and were lucky enough that he was available several days later.With Nyoman\u2019 s experience and recommendations we soon had a full day tour planned which suited both our needs and personal preferences. Nyoman kindly assisted to ensure we were safe at all times whenever we encountered the numerous steps or uneven ground at some of the sites. At no time did we feel rushed or under pressure during our sightseeing. Nyoman was very knowledgeable and had no trouble interpreting and answering all the questions we asked him.Everything required was provided and the cool scented towels and cold water was a welcome bonus whenever needed.We shared lots of jokes and laughs and felt like we had known him for much longer than just a day.He noticed I had a cough and went above and beyond his duty in obtaining some herbal medicine for me and also stopped at several roadside fruit stalls until he found some special coconuts, which he said would also be very helpful.Whilst visiting the tea and coffee plantation he obtained some raw turmeric and explained that if my sister rubbed it on her scratches they would heal very soon \u2013 lo and behold - a few days later they were gone!On the way back we asked if we could check out another resort for future reference and he enthusiastically obliged \u2013 even though at that stage we had been out and about for ten hours.We would have no hesitation in calling Nyoman next time we are in Bali and would recommend him to anyone who requires a safe, confident, obliging and knowledgeable driver with a friendly and happy disposition and a lovely radiant smile.Thank you Nyoman and we hope your girlfriends nursing graduation goes really well and your future together is truly happy. Kind Aussie wishes from Carolyn & Pamela"

We have found Ubud friendly driver's website on internet and, as reviews were quite good, we decided to book a full-day tour with Nyoman Astawa. The first day Astawa took us to see a traditional Balinese dance show and after that we went to Beratan Lake visiting Jiatiluwih rice-fields, Candi kuning's market and Ulun Danu temple. The second day we first went to Goa Gajah and Yeh Puluh close to Ubud, and then we headed toward Batur lake to see the volcano; on the road we visited Tirta Empul and Gunung Kawi temples, Tegallalan rice terraces and a coffee plantation. We were very satisfied with these tours, trip advisor reviews tell the truth: Astawa is friendly, very punctual and trustworthy. He drives very safely (important thing in Bali!) and he can speak English very well (better than us actually...). All Balinese tours are more or less organized on the same scheme: once you decide the direction to take (north/south ecc.), you will have few occasions to choose what to visit on the road, but if this is your first trip in Bali you can rely on Astawa to take you on the worth-seeing places. We regrets that he hadn't few days more to go on northern coast with him or to Sidemen and Mother temple...that will be for next time..."

We have just returned from our trip to Bali and can highly recommend Nyoman Astawa (info@driver-ubud.com or www.driver-ubud.com). We booked Nyoman based on other reviews on trip advisor, and was really happy with our choice.Nyoman has just upgraded his vehicle and it can comfortably seat at least five (5) passengers and is fully airconditioned. Nyoman was on time for every day that we booked him (he was actually early on every occassion). He provides icy cold bottled water for his customers and cool towels to clean our face and hands etc. Nyoman initially picked us up from the airport and delivered us to our hotel in Sanur where we spent a couple of days by ourselves. He then took us on a tour of Bali with overnight stops at Amed ,Lovina, Ubud and then finally to Legian beach (we booked /paid for our own accomodation and entrance fees) Nyoman also took us back to the airport on our final night. Nyoman speaks very good English and is extremely helpful and knowledgeable about Bali. He is courteous and a geniunely nice person. He was great when we changed our itinerary (with little prior warning) and was available whenever we needed his services (early morning and late evening for airport transfers).I can honestly state that you use Nyoman's services you will be very happy. We certainly were - he made our holiday so much better than we had hoped or expected. Thank you Nyoman - from two happy Aussies"

He would offer us cold towels & mineral waters often, ensuring that we are always well-hydrated & fresh from every stop that we visited. These simple acts show that he takes pride in his work & is true to his clients. Other than our self-prepared itinerary of the interesting places to visit in Bali, Nyoman also helps to recommend other places of attraction that we might have missed out in our initial planning. His geographical knowledge of Bali & the efficient route planning helps to minimize any delays in traffic & therefore, maximizing our short stay in Bali & enabling us to visit most of the key attractions. Nyoman is very accommodating to our needs & is very patient. For example, we would sometimes incidentally overspent our time at a certain place of interest but he would never get annoyed. At times, we would overshot his booking hours but he is fine with the extension with no extra charges. Furthermore, any car park or car entrance fees would be borne by him, so we feel his price is reasonable & we feel safe with him as our tour guide & driver. Engaging his services also includes sarongs when we visit temples & umbrellas when it rains. Best person to ask if one needs to get the best view of the scenery or where to enjoy a good meal. A must-try tour guide & driver to make your Bali trip an unforgettable & enjoyable one. Thumbs Up to Nyoman Astawa for doing an excellent job!"

He gave us so much information and told us many stories as we were driving to allow us to understand more about Bali, the people and the culture - which was really enriching and added an extra dimension to some of our visits.

Each time we had to make him clear that we wanted to see nature, organic farming and woodcraft manufacturers. He could not believe we were not interested in temples, art and silver shops. And then it becomes grueling clear that Bali is getting very dirty, overpopulated and lacking infrastructure. The average speed you can travel is 35 km/h because of the very narrow roads and the millions of stinking scooters. I only knew the stories of Bali from years ago and what a disappointment it was. Maybe it is because we live on the beautiful South Island of New Zealand? But day three Astawa got the picture and showed us some really nice places with less people and scooters. And yes he is nice, got us some wonderful take away sateh and was always punctual on time. So thank you Astawa, showing us the real Bali!"

He provided suggestions of an itinerary to suit our interests, but was ready to cater to our needs whenever we told him of what we would like to see!On the first day, he drove for two hours from Ubud (where he is based) to come fetch us at our hotel (we only knew that when we asked him). He was always very punctual when it came to pick-ups, and he would always be reassuringly waiting for us at the end of visiting an attraction, or watching a performance or meal. Throughout the tour, it was easy to speak to him, as he is an attentive listener and forthcoming in sharing about his life, interests and Balinese culture. Astawa is very professional in his service and makes sure that his clients are kept comfortable at all times. He provides a folder of write-ups about each attraction, cold mineral water, cold towels, umbrellas, sarongs for temple visits, and provides wi-fi service all within a clean and comfortable vehicle. On the first day, my slipper was soaked wet due to a heavy downpour and I asked Astawa if I could buy an affordable pair of slippers anywhere. He promptly found me a shop along the way, and told me to remain in the car so that he could get the best \"local\" price for me - even changing the size of the slippers for me when it was too small. He also gladly extended his service for the day for us to catch a Barong performance, and take-away our food from a restaurant for dinner.Throughout the two days we had with him, he brought us to see several sights of Bali (volcano, temple, padi fields, coffee plantations). He also brought us to watch some local performances (at our request) and had a seafood dinner at a beautiful beach. We visited several places as well (jewellery factory, painting gallery etc.) where we learnt more about the local craftsmanship.Astawa is a humble, patient and amiable person that we were grateful to meet in Bali.

            "review": "Nyoman - Best driver in Bali!. I met Nyoman through trip advisor and decided to engage him due to all the good feedback he has received from travelers across the globe. This was my fiance's and my first trip to Bali and we really did not know what to expect. Right from the first day in picking us up at the airport, Nyoman was punctual and extremely hospitable; he introduced us to places we drove pass and answered our questions well and patiently. In addition, he provides great service. Each time we hopped onto his car, he provided us with a cold towel ( since the weather in Bali is warm), a bottle of cold water each, as well as free wifi! In the first half of our trip, we stayed in Ubud. Nyoman is from Ubud and he is extremely eloquent in the tradition and cultures in the village. He gave us a full day tour ( 10 hours) around ubud to beautiful places- volcano where we actually got to lunch within the clouds!, beautiful landscape such as rice terraces and farmers at work, a coffee plantation which span across many hectares of land ( with free tasting) and Nyoman explained the process of coffee making well. He also brought us to watch the traditional Barong Dance which depicts the story of tradition folktale in the village. He brought us backstage for a tour and explained the culture and tradition behind the dance to us. Nyoman also explained the everyday lifestyle of people in the arts village of ubud which was very interesting to learn about.Above all, Nyoman really took care of our wellbeing during our stay in Bali. He would go the extra mile to offer us interesting activities (such as bringing us to a secret beach!) and offering to help us out on days when we were not with him but got caught in bad weather. He was constantly in contact with us through facebook on days we were on free and easy to check that we were safe. He gives good recommendations of where to eat as well as places of attractions, and definitely knows where one can get these at cheaper rates!If you are looking for someone you can trust to bring you around Bali (not just ubud), having all activities and tours well planned out for you, knowing you can doze off after an enjoyable day out in the comfort of his car and still reach your destination safely - Nyoman Astawa is THE MAN!"

I talked over my plans with Nyoman and he put forward his suggestions. Nyoman had a good command of English and was able to inform, listen and discuss about Balinese history and current affairs. He had good knowledge of its rituals and customs and was welcoming, friendly and considerate.He was punctual to collecting me from my hotel and drove safely along Bali's roads, a few of which are in bad condition. He arranged for a sarong at temples and an umbrella when there was a downpour. He accompanied me around the grounds to avoid being harrassed by tour guides. I thank him for enabling me to see a lot of what Bali has to offer. His vehicle was in good clean condition. I was able to take in about 8-10 hours a day with Nyoman at the helm and then enjoy dinner around my hotel area. I wish I had more time to see more, but there's always next time when I will be back and I'd recommend Nyoman to anyone looking for a safe and friendly driver in bali for their stay."

My friend and I booked back-to-back cruises which gave us the opportunity to stay in Bali for 3 full days. Before I left the US, I got in touch with Nyoman Astawa through Trip Advisor and through meaningful e-mails was able to set up a tentative itinerary. Nyoman was right on time to pick us up at the pier. He then took us through the southern section of Bali. Nyoman is not just a driver. He escorted us to each temple, beach or other attraction giving detail and meaning. The next day, he again picked us up and we toured the Ubud region.Nyoman is the type of guide that will work with anyone to provide the experiences that you wish. I had expressed to Nyoman my wish to buy fabric wallhangings. He was patient and understanding as he took me from place to place. He wasn't happy until I was. His English is very good and his driving skills are excellent. This is extremely important in motorbike crazy Bali. The third day he brought us to the type of spa I was looking for - reasonalble but a true Balinese experience. He wants to please and he does. I highly recommend him as someone honest and sincere with a willingness to please his clients."

Visiting Bali last summer i had an amazing time, the place is stunning and my daughter and i had such a wonderful time. however I felt compelled to write about Nyoman our taxi driver we met in Ubud. At first of course he was friendly and helpful and very very informative about where to go, what shopping to do and the best prices to pay. But i can honestly say that he went far above the call of duty in looking after us. From taking us the best shopping spots, to even coming to help us out when we moved from Ubud down to Kuta and when i fell ill he was amazing in assisting to get things done and even when hearing i needed an extra bag for traveling home did he travel to his sisters shop and purchase one for me and deliver it to us to make it easier for me when i was not well. He truy was amazing and have since kept his number which i have handed out to many of my friends visiting Bali who too share the same sentiment as me. Thank you Nyoman for being so helpful and making our experience of Bali and the Balinese people so enjoyable!"

Our guide was Capri (Kapree?) who is Wayan's nephew and he was outstanding! From the moment we met him we were at ease and were laughing within minutes. The conversation flowed all day long and his local AND international knowledge was extremely impressive. Nothing was too much bother and although we have been on tours in Bali before, this trip was the most informative and relaxed to date. Capri was very attentive, extremely polite, safe, cautious and by the end of the day I felt my knowledge of Bali and the Balinese culture had been expanded beyond belief. Would highly recommend... HIGHLY... Our best day in Bali, Thank you Capri... Paula and Dave"

And I\u2019m incredibly glad that I did! The team at Amansuka was incredibly accommodating of my last minute request for a day tour. I ended up booking the Traditional Morning Market, Historical Temple, and Volcano Tour and was lucky to have Wayan Arjana as my driver/guide for the day. From the first minute to the very last, Wayan shared stories about his culture, daily life as a Balinese, and the history and significance of each of the places we visited. There was never a dull moment, as he fielded all my questions with great detail.Even the smallest considerations like preparing a cold hand towel to refresh after each stop, providing sarongs for temple visits, taking the side streets to avoid traffic, and haggling with the coconut man to get the local price were very thoughtful and greatly appreciated.It was a long day (we visited 9 places total!), and Wayan remained engaged the whole time. It was great to see so much of Bali, and these sights were greatly enhanced by the extra context Wayan provided.This was without a doubt the best day tour I\u2019ve ever been on. If you\u2019re looking for a professional, friendly, and engaged guide with heaps of knowledge about Bali and its beautiful culture, I highly recommend booking a trip with Amansuka. Thanks so much Wayan Arjana for a wonderful day, and I look forward to recommending your services to all my friends and family!"

The car is extremely clean and Amansuka makes sure that we had everything we wanted. From the first minute he took us at the hotel until he left us, we've been talking about everything. He is extremely well educated in the various things in Bali - conversationgs shifting from religion to politics to food etc...I will highly recommend him for a tour.While talking food to him, he asked us if we enjoyed good local street food and when we said yes, he stopped at a nice place on our way, bought some really nice food for both my wife and I as a gift. Not only that you learn a lot on the Balinese culture but he will become your friend after the tour."

We saw much more throughout the day and enjoyed getting a taste of the culture so much that we booked a second day later in the week to see more of the island. Highly recommended! Although there was no expectation of providing lunch for the guide, Gusti accepted our invatation to join us for lunch both days and we enjoyed the mealtime conversation with him."

He made us feel so at ease, wrapped us in sarongs when it was cold at the top of the mountain (we weren't really dressed for cold), took us to some amazing places, constantly took the most fabulous pictures of us both, and dropped so much knowledge and philosophy he probably changed our lives forever. He's such a peaceful, cheerful man and has so much to share its worth spending some real time with him. Bali is beautiful and Wayan will show you everything in its best light."

We were ripped off by another company, so we really appreciated Amansuka Tours for their hard work and honesty.We booked a custom tour on the Wednesday afternoon, we flew in and Wayan picked us up from the hotel at 2.30 in Legian and took us to the Uluwatu temple, it was such a stunning site, Wayan is extremely knowledgeable about the area, history and pointed things out to us along the way, on the way back he stopped at a shopping centre for us because we had forgotten toothpaste and some other essential items. We were supposed to go to a restaurant at 7:00 pm but we were so tired Wayan took us back to the hotel. We were very happy with our custom tour that Wayan was able to fit into our afternoon.On the Friday we picked the Singaraja 'Lovina' Tour. If you only have 1 free tour day in Bali make it this tour!!! We went to the Ulun duna Temple which was just breath taking it was 50,000IDR each to get in, which I though was a bit expensive, until we go inside it was worth every cent. The grounds and temple are just one of kind, the mountains by the lake are just stunning. We were also lucky enough that there was a Hindu ceremony happening at the same time so Wayan was able to explain a lot of that to us. We also went to the Gitgit waterfalls, Lovina Beach, the Twin Lakes (it's cold up there take a jumper or cardigan), the hot springs and the Buddhist Temple. We saw so much of Bali and different ways of life of people. We were surprised when we were cold up at the Twin Lakes and stopped for coffee and a fried banana.Wayan personally, has a very friendly manner, he is approachable and easy to talk to, we didn't feel uncomfortable asking him questions or joking with him. Being in a car for 12 hours I think it's important you can relax and relate to the person you are with.Amansuka is a family company, I think it shows, the effort and personal touches Wayan put into our tour were above and beyond what we received from other tours and drivers during our stay in Bali.We already want to come back and do more tours with Wayan."

The email exchange was a little pushy, he kept trying to add other things, but since the reviews were so good we booked two day tours anyway. Wayan was a good tour guide, he spoke great English and was amiable to however much time we wanted to spend taking pictures. Tanah Lot itself was incredibly crowded and touristy - not the tour guide's fault - just a heads up. Although we enjoyed ourselves a great deal, we ended up paying entrance fees in the sum of something like $50 total for every place we went to. Now, the confirmation email he sent did say that entrance \"fee\" was not included, but it didn't specify what those fees were. Plus, the fees for Tanah Lot had been recently increased. Luckily, we had enough money to pay for everything but it was super shady not to be upfront about that kind of thing, especially when people are usually traveling on a budget. We cancelled our second day trip because of the additional costs. I don't mind paying for things as long as I have a heads up I have to pay for them. If you book with them, ask for a thorough price list."

Wayan is passionate about his family owned and operated business, and he truly cares about his guests. He is a wealth of knowledge and taught us so much. We started the day at a traditional Balinese home, then went to the Tengugan waterfall, followed by the Tagalalalong rice fields, lunch overlooking the volcano, then to my favorite part of the day: Tirta Empul temple, where we purified ourselves with holy water. We finished the day at the Gunung Kawi temple, and then he dropped us off at our hotel. Sean and I have used drivers throughout our time in Indonesia, and nothing compares to Wayan's services. He stayed with us the entire time, and educated us about all of the places we visited. It was so interesting and amazing to hear the history behind it all.

As a first time Bali visitor, Wayan was really good about making us comfortable, from the prompt Denpasar airport pick-up to the making of excursion deals for us so we got the local price and making of spa appointments. His English is very easy to understand. He flavored the tour of the temples/countryside with Balinese culture/wisdom, which we requested and appreciated. He provided sarongs whenever temple dress was mandated and he had umbrellas on standby for the afternoon rains. He was aware of issues we might have with Bali food (\"Bali belly\" is a problem for westerners sometimes) and pointed us to eateries that would be safe. His driving tours seem to be based out of Ubud, so he is really good for seeing mountain scenery, rice terraces, and temples in central to North Bali. He has a lot of local connections and recommendations, so helped us to get into the #2 cooking class in Ubud (recommended for its small class size). He also helped us to get a rafting excursion for half of the list price. Coming from a Northern climate and not being acclimated to tropical climate, it made a huge difference to always have an air conditioned car waiting for us so we could really enjoy each day.

He worked with our scheduling issues, and ended up providing a tour and transfer between Legian and Ubud. What is important to note first is that he's a great guy. You're essentially spending a day trapped in a car with a stranger on those Balinese roads (ohhhhh those Bali roads). He's very nice, he's funny, and he's personable. It was like we were touring with a friend. He would translate interesting conversations going on around us, and some of them were quite entertaining!Having scoured TripAdvisor prior to our departure, I had a list of things I wanted to see (and no idea whether that list was reasonable or realistic). Wayan took a look at the list, and offered suggestions for a more reasonable itinerary. What resulted was a great tour of the central part of the island, from the southern coast to Lake Beratan, and back to Ubud. Wayan was right on time picking us up from our Legian hotel, greeted us at 0830 with a smile, and helped load our luggage into his van. Throughout the tour, we peppered him with questions about Balinese life, culture, politics, and essentially any information you might ask. He was so incredibly knowledgeable (and delicately pointed out any misinformation we were fed earlier in our trip). We learned SO much about Bali with him!In sum, I cannot recommend Wayan enough. Had we more time in Ubud, we would have absolutely booked several days with him and toured more of the country. Go! And enjoy!"

One of the sites we visited was Besakih, he told me that if I'm lucky he will be accompanying me inside the temple and that I dont have to pay for a guide, it confused me all of a sudden why he would say that and insisted that he come with me inside.

We customized our tour making it more of a 'temple day' and ending with his suggestion of the waterfall. Wayan answered our curiosity's questions to the best of our ability, but it really gave us a great insight on the gratitude and humbleness of the Bali people. It really gave us perspective on how we can take that information home with us. Great car chats, great tour! Thanks again Wayan Eka and amansuka, more than you know!"

We spent 10 days in Bali around the end of August and we had the chance to spend some time with Made who is an incredible guide and driver. Very kind and keen on teaching us the Balinese culture and way of life, Made took us on two day tours around Ubud to the most amazing and scenic places such as the Tegalalang and Jatiluwih rice terraces or Mount Kawi. He was very responsive to what we wanted to visit. Made was also our driver for both our airport transfers and our trip from Ubud to Pemuteran (both ways). We really advise you Amansuka which was very responsive when we contacted them by mail prior our departure to organize our trip. Matur Suksma!On vous conseille vraiment Amansuka pour votre voyage \u00e0 Bali, surtout si vous passez du temps dans les environs d'Ubud.

I came across Amansuka Tours on TripAdvisor a few days before and luckily there was availability for the date I needed. Initially as a solo traveller I was nervous travelling alone with someone I hadn't met for the full day however when I met Wayan my worries vanished. He was friendly and easy to get along with. I learnt so much about the Balinese culture throughout the day. I got so much more out of this experience by going with Amansuka tours, as they are a family business who are from the area and therefore answered all my questions and taught me so much. As I had only one day I wasn't expecting to fit so much in. Wayan managed to fit in 11 different sites! My favourite experiences were visiting a Balinese family house, visiting the temples, the monkey forest and the coffee plantation.Amazing day! Couldn't recommend them enough! "

This pretty much became a custom made tour. Nyoman made some good suggestions. Firstly we stopped at the butterfly sanctuary which was really nice and held a large collection of colourful butterflies. Then off to the nearby waterfall, sorry can't remember the name but it's close to the butterfly sanctuary. Wow, the waterfall was running well and the opportunity to swim was available, so take your bathers. There were warungs and souvenir stalls at the waterfall if you get hungry or want to shop. Next stop was for Lewak coffee and herbal tea tastings at Taman Ayu where they make the products.This was set in a jungle setting overlooking an old temple. Relaxing location where we sampled the coffee and teas which were really good. Next stop Tanah Lot for the sunset. Hundreds and hundreds of tourists rolling up on big tourist buses. This took the ambiance away to say the least but it was good to see the temple.Then we went to Melasti restaurant for our seafood dinner. This restaurant overlooks the ocean and temple and is outdoors. This was a mistake as everything we ate was bad. Aside from this we had a really enjoyable day with Nyoman. Nyoman was such a pleasant, kind and courteous man with a good sense of humour. We got to know him over the afternoon. We learned about his family and his life which was good to hear about. Nothing was too much trouble for him. If you pick a tour to Tanah Lot best not to eat there or Google restaurant reviews before selecting a restaurant. Thank you Nyoman for an enjoyable tour, we enjoyed your company very much :-)"

He has an immaculately clean and comfortable car, and drives carefully. At no time were we concerned for our well being or safety. He is prompt, courteous, and professional. Our communication was through email until our arrival to Indonesia. We always received quick responses to any messages we sent.We had planned a short visit to Bali, so as first time visitors, we wanted to see as much as possible. We decided a private guided tour would be ideal. We couldn't have asked for a better guide. I chose Suka through reviews I read on TripAdvisor. Suka helped us to customize our itinerary based on our interests. We covered the Central Mountain region part of the East Coast. He explained so much about Balinese culture and people. We saw many examples of daily life and the beautiful countryside. We were able to avoid a lot of the heavily visited sites. We spent approximately 9-10 hours each day touring. That is a long day of driving, but Suka did not seem to mind.When I return to Bali, I will seek out Amansuka Tour for services. I will also recommend him to anyone searching for a guide or driver. We couldn't be more pleased with our first stay in Bali."

We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 days with Wayan Suka and Wayan Eka, both very professional safe drivers who also pride their business on being guides not just drivers. This makes them a step up to the average driver which is much more enjoyable. They gave us an interesting insight into the Balinese way of life as they skilfully drove through the bustling market places and quiet country laneways of Bali. I have visited Bali 4 times before and have learnt so much more this time than previous visits. At each attraction they went out of their way to show us the best areas, take photos for us, suggest the best places to have lunch, but never tried to talk us into seeing something we didn't want to see as many other drivers do. Wayan Eka took us to his family temple where we were lucky enough to meet his mother and share a cup of coffee with his family and friends. This was a very special time which we will never forget. We won't hesitate to use these guides next time we are in Bali and I have already recommended them to my friends who will be visiting in December.

On the first occasion, i incorporated a transfer from Seminyak to Ubud while exploring some temples and other local attractions like rice fields,; the next occasion was a whole day tour and the last was a transfer from Ubud back to Bali airport.What impressed me was the level of flexibility my driver (Wayan's nephew) had in my itinerary. After weeks of emailing and discussing with Wayan (Uncle) a tour itinerary I had to make a last minute change: I was meant to have got to Uluwatu the day before on my own but due to bad weather i didn't go. I told Wayan (nephew) on the first day of my tour and he handled this with upmost professionalism. He did not question my decision at all. So I knew from that point, their focus is on the customer. In addition to this, I did not have to wait in the lobby of my hotel for them- like when they say they will be there at a certain time, they will be there!Wayan my driver/guide was a gracious and funny host where we joked around and laughed during my tour. However, it was disappointing that Wayan could not drop me off to the airport as i wanted to properly thank him for an amazing time i had with him.What i truly liked about this tour company is that its a small family run business, where the money goes back to the driver and their village. We, from a western culture need to support such companies and give back to those that survive on our tourist dollars! Their prices were very competitive with other tour comanies in Bali and would happily recommend them to TA readers. I would most certainly use them again without a doubt!"

First, we were late to the hotel for our pickup that I had made weeks prior and just confirmed the day before (batik class took much longer than expected and there was a lot of traffic due to a parade). We rushed in the hotel for a very calm man to be waiting, telling us it would be fine, that he would wait even longer for us to go to our room and use the bathroom and such. Much appreciated! Well, my daughter got a little case of the \"Bali Belly\" I just couldn't put her in the car for an entire afternoon not feeling well. As I am a single parent and was tending to her, I called the front desk and asked them to tell our driver we needed to cancel and that I would not be returning. Later (almost an hour later) I went to the front desk to ask a question. He was still there!! The front desk never told him!! After getting very upset and making a scene in the lobby insisting the front desk apologize to this man...he remained so calm. He told me outside that it was ok, this was common with this hotel, that he understood and to go be with my daughter. As horrible as I felt for being late, cancelling and then unknowingly keeping him waiting...he was still so calm and kind to me. This says so much about a persons character. I recommend this company based on this and feel that if you are able to use them, you will be well taken care of. Amansuka, thank you so much for understanding."

Everything we saw was fantastic, Made, our tour guide was really friendly and had lots of information to give us on Bali and the culture, he even stopped off at a rice terrace and asked a lady if we could have a go at harvesting her rice! He was more than happy to stop anywhere we wanted en route and had spare sarongs in the boot for when we went to the temples. The experience was amazing and getting to see so much in one day was so unique. We would definitely recommend them to anyone! Thank you!"

Throughout the day we visited a Balinese house, local art shops, taman ayun and ulundanu bratan temples, the amazing Jatiluwih rice terrace and finished the day admiring the sunset at Tanah lot. We never felt in any rush and we particularly appreciated Nyoman's insight and kindness. Highly Recommended!"

The whole service was superb!I initially e-mailed at really late notice, but Wayan Jr had no problem in fitting us into the diary. The day was completely orientated around what you wanted to see as a guest. For our tour, we opted to visit as many temples as possible in the day, and Wayan had no issue in taking a little extra time to see the bits you wanted to see. Despite the price being for a 9am-6pm tour, it was nearing on 7pm by the time we got back as Wayan Jr took a detour to the Luwak coffee farm with no hesitation! What also helped is that we were picked up from out hotel in Ubud in the morning, and then dropped off in Seminyak later in the day.In summary, an fantastic day with a fantastic guide that was completely tailored to you as a guest! 5 star easily!"

We had two amazing days of tours to all the best temples & sights around Ubud & surrounding area. Each day Wayan would take us to so many amazing places sharing his expertise and local knowledge. Each day he took us to a fantastic place for lunch; day 1 this involved a fantastic view of Mount Batur. I especially loved Tirta Empul, Pura Kehen, Bangli, & Kerta Gosa floating palace & courts of justice at Klungkung. Wayan was friendly, courteous & polite. He stopped for the toilet when we needed it & we learnt so much about Balinese life and culture. Thank you so much Wayan for making our holiday."

A vacation is so much more enjoyable and enriching when you have an experienced guide. And it's worth every penny to not worry about driving in Bali. I've driven in Paris, but driving in Bali looks even more stressful! I could tell Suka is a sharp and careful driver though so I was able to nap peacefully on long drives. :) There is so much to learn about the culture and the history you don't want to miss so Suka's proficient English and deep Bali knowledge was great. We had 2 other drivers on the trip and the language barrier made it more difficult to get much info from them.But above all, I am glad we found a trustful person. He was responsive in correspondence and arrived on time. We had a 5 year old with us and he was so kind and attentive with him. He has great suggestions, but also laid back and flexible on plans too. As others have mentioned here, he seems to have a wise and kind soul!Suka - Thank you for a wonderful vacation with many great memories for life - much because of you!"

My partner and I were able to cherry pick attractions for a customized 1-day tour, and he's very accommodating to our arrangements (even when our destinations are practically spread all over Bali and he had to drive for hours).Amansuka speaks very good English, has a deep knowledge of the Balinese culture and is very well mannered. He never failed to make us comfortable throughout the whole trip, and worked diligently to make sure that we see the best of Bali. Unlike many other guides in Bali, he does not cut corners and would be the last person to bring you to a tourist trap. Amansuka is like a Balinese friend who's happy to show you his hometown, and his tours are also competitively priced (we even gave him a good tip for the fantastic tour).If you're arranging for a day tour in Bali, look no further. Thank you Amansuka for the great experience, and see you again when I visit Bali."

Wayan' knowledge of the Balinese spirituality is incredibly profound and he was able to relate those ideas to us, completely alien to his culture and way of life, so so well.The entire tour, which he gladly brought us around ubud and its surrounding sights and temples for a good 10-11 hours, were deeply insightful. My friends and I came off the tour filled with so much knowledge, ideas and appreciation for Bali and her beautiful people and their way of life. And there is still so much to know, to learn, to explore. Amansuka's tour does not just broaden your horizons, it also broadens your world view, your mind, and finally, your heart.That is how special Amansuka's tour is to us.

Wayan treats all his customers like old-time friends and that was apparent in that 2 days when we had our tours with him. My mom had a bad leg during the trip and he would think of alternative routes or places that would suit her better. We are also appreciative that he did not try to inject his ideas into the tour; instead he would constantly seek our opinions which made us very comfortable throughout the trip. I have included 2 photos which i took during the tours, one was taken in a restaurant (that serves awesome organic food) facing Mt Batur and another was the breathtaking Uluwatu Sunset.Made was our driver who drove us from our hotel in Ubud to the airport. To our surprise, he is not just a driver but also a guide in that 1.5hrs drive! He is someone with lots of positive energy and is very willing to share with us what he knows about Bali and even Indonesia as a whole!Look no further if you need a guide in Bali! :)"

We also went to the irrigation museum, saw a traditional Balinese home and went to Jutiluwih rice terrace where we got to see some farmers and buffalo farming the rice. Wayan showed us a local warung where we would try suckling pig, we had never tried it or eaten at a warung so that was a great experience.Wayan gave us a lot of information throughout the tour which was very helpful and he was great to chat to and made us feel very comfortable.Our flight had been delayed the night before so we had only slept for three hours before wayan picked us up. We kept falling asleep in his car and he was very considerate not to wake us up and even went and got the car for us after the walk in the rice terrace so that we didn't have to walk. Thank you so much for a great day wayan!!! Our second tour we had another driver named wayan who took us to GWK to see some amazing giant statues of Garuda and Vishnu, it was such a great experience and we really appreciate the information he provided about the Vishnu and how long the statue has taken to build. We also stopped at Padang Padang beach before heading to Uluwatu to watch the sunset. The views from Uluwatu temple were breathtaking and we got some great photos here, wayan knew the best spot for us to watch the sunset and took some photos for us.Wayan then took us to Jimbaran bay to a restaurant called 'new moon' for a seafood dinner.Thank you wayan, we enjoyed our tour!We would recommend Amansuka tours to anyone who would like to see something different and we liked that we could customize the tour based on what we wanted to see and how long we had. We look forward to seeing you on our next trip to Bali for some more tours!!"

Considering we had Wayan for a full day the cost was exceptional for what we did. Day two was to go White Water rafting, which I have to say was brilliant and cannot wait to do this again. He organised transport to a local company and got us a great deal. Yes he probably will get commission but when you workout what you pay, a good half day rafting and a delicious lunch at the end you cannot complain.

Wayan was very punctual and his vehicle is well maintained and comfortable. We wanted to combine the move between the hotels with a day tour of Balinese countryside. Wayan came up with several excellent suggestions for the trip. During our journey to Ubud, Wayan shared a lot of valuable and interesting information on Balinese life and culture. He's very knowledgeable and speaks excellent English. Because he's a licensed guide, we were able to save money at the Mother Temple in east Bali and avoid the need to negotiate with and hire local guides.

I can confirm that he is an excellent guide, but out of the 3 days booked with him, we only had the pleasure to meet him during the first day of our Bali tours . On une 28th, a family member came to pick us up, as one of his relatives had passed away and he had to organize the funeral. We had also booked him for July 7th and he wasn't available because his son had a badminton tournament, so somebody from another company came to pick us up. From my experience during our Bali trip,4 out of 6 planned transportations were not done by the person we initially fixed the appointment with. They will always tell you ' yes I'm available ', but then it's the cousin of the brother or the nephew of the aunt that will come instead.To pay 60 USD for a day tour with someone who is exceptionally well quoted is fine, but if then you have to pay the same amount for somebody you didn't choose and with a service that is basically ok but far less professional than with Wayan himself is questionable."

He arrived on time to picked us up in the morning with a nice spacious van.Amansuka drives very carefully on the small and bumpy roads of Bali which made us feel very comfortable and safe. He speaks excellent English and has the typical Balinese curiosity to him which makes it easy to learn more about Bali and it's culture. We had many interesting conversations with him in the car which made the time between stops feel very short. He also provides good suggestions on places to visit but you can of course decide yourself which places you want to visit. Unlike some other drivers-for-hire on Bali Amansuka would never take you to places where you feel obliged to buy something. On the contrary, he gives advice on how to avoid the many touts in tourist areas. Also, when going places of interest Amansuka will join and share his knowledge about the place rather than just wait by the car. If you are visiting a temple, he will provide you with the required sarong. The next day we booked Amansuka again to go to the airport. So you can also book him as airport transfer, if he is available of course he primarily do half day or full day tours. All in all we could not be happier with this service. The rates are extremely reasonable so if you are satisfied with the service I think he deserves a generous tip."

My ankle starting really hurting from an injury I got a few days earlier with a different guide. Wayan took me to a doctor, went in with me to translate, and helped in every way he could. He was totally understanding when I had to cancel our tour for the next day for bed rest. The next day he adjusted the tour (with his brother in law I think) to have less walking but still see interesting things. On our last day he stopped wherever we wanted to buy things and see things and then dropped us off at the airport late at night. He made it easy and interesting."

Aside from being a wonderful, skilled driver through the narrow, busy, scooter-filled roads and local backroads, Suka is a great teacher of Balinese culture and Hindu beliefs. Bali is gorgeous itself, but with Suka, Bali became alive and more personal. His English is excellent, making communication, conversations and questions easy. He helped explain the history and design of each of the numerous magnificent temples we visited and arranged the tour around our schedule, desires and needs. Suka even went out of his way to help us by stopping by the grocery store during our daily tours, and helped fill in our tours with suggested sites and highlights along the way to points we already wanted to see. His transport was roomy for the 5 of us, clean, cold AC for our daily drives around Bali. Rates are reasonable $50-60/day. Our 5 yr old son loved Suka and had a great time helping to grind coffee beans at a local agriculture farm stop. The most memorable part though, was a stop at a random local residence where Suka introduced us to the random family and to their open and welcoming lifestyle of Bali culture. Here Suka taught us the traditional layout of a Bali residence, how the extended family live together there, and the importance and incorporation the Hindu religion into the residence. It is no surprise that the other reviews for Suka are similar, and next time we visit, we will be sure to contact Suka again."

Wayan really went out of his way to make our tour and stay in Bali one we wouldn't forget. During our tours he provided us with tastes of local food and drink with explanations about how they are made, and where they come from etc. He also indulged us with lots of explinations about Balinese culture and was able to answer all our questions. Wayan ensured we didn't do the same thing twice throughout our tours and offered us lots of flexibility and alternatives. He even helped us find a good massage and picked us up earlier to take us there. Basically the service we received was lovely, there was a lot more he did that I won't put here but you couldn't have met a nicer guy who cares about his community and guests. We encouage others who are visiting to book with Amansuka tours to take you around and show you Bali."

After reviewing some reviews about Amansuka Tours, we decided to book them for our tours. It was the best decision. Wayan Suka, the guide, was extremely nice, very knowledgable, and helpful. Initially we booked one trip with him, to visit some of the must see places in Ubud. After spending a whole day with him, we decided to book another day to explore the other cities in Bali. He went out of his way to take us to the places that were a must see. Everywhere we went to visit had history, and Wayan knew so much about all of these places and it was great to hear about everything and get more insights from a local himself. I really appreciate everything Wayan did for us the several times that we saw him. Although we only expected a tour with him, he literally went above and beyond for us, doing things I did not mention here. We feel fortunate to have met someone as kind as he was, and some things he said and advices he gave are things my husband and I still reflect on and talk about."

He told us he worked in a large tour company for several years before setting up this private tour company 8 years ago with his brother. His experience really shows in everything he does. He is calm and polite and has a great sense of humour. He's an excellent and safe driver and really knows his routes well. He answered every question we asked (religious, political, historical, agricultural, personal etc), and he shared with us the Balinese philosophy of life and its religion. He brought us to visit a random family's home compound to illustrate the Balinese philosophy of welcoming all and sundry to their home (hence the front gates are always open during the day). I feel I really have a deeper understanding and respect for the Balinese culture in the two short but action packed days my family of 2 adults and 2 boys (aged 7 and 11) spent with him. Wayan speaks fluent English and Japanese, so if you're looking for a knowledgeable and licenced tour guide and a safe driver all in one, look no further than Wayan!"

Nyoman picked up at the airport and also did a tour/transfer from Ubud to Pemuteran. Wayan Suka helped up plan both the trip to Pemuteran as well as guided us on a day trip to Kintamani. Both of them were kind to accommodate our dietary restrictions and Suka stopped at a great organic restaurant in Kintamani. They are knowledgeable and helped us get a good sense of Balinese culture. They was always cold water available in the coolers and Sarong's for us to use while visiting temples.Suka's email communication while we were in US was prompt and the prices were right. I would highly recommend using Suka and his company for all your travel needs."

Not only is he a genuinely lovely person, but he went out of his way to make sure my friend and I experienced true Balinese culture. From visiting the local school and sharing a cup of tea in the home of a Balinese family to walking through lush green rice fields, it was by far one of the best days we had during our time in Bali. If you want to experience and immerse yourself in the beautiful culture of Bali then let Wayan show you."

At first, I was very apprehensive about booking a tour as I'd be on my own, but after the first few minutes, I quickly settled in and reaped the advantage of having the guide all to myself :)Wayan is extremely kind, knowledgeable and a very careful and considerate driver. Please know when you're booking through him, it is a family oriented business and he truly cares about its reputation and making customers happy. He embodies the true spirit of Bali as he makes it a point to greet the locals we come across, always with a genuine smile on his face. When speaking with him, you will have a genuine conversation about all aspects of life and he not only teaches you about Balinese culture but about life in general! He was very prompt with the email replies and was very accommodating when my flight time changed last minute. Remember to book a few days or weeks in advance cause he gets busy!I took a full day tour with Wayan and he took me to the marketplace (I was the only tourist in the whole place), to a traditional Balinese home (just a tip - I wish I brought some gifts for the family), the rice terraces, waterfall, the coffee plantation, the water temple, and a lunch spot at batur mountain. He was able to squeeze in the elephant temple, was able to find me a working atm and even dropped me off to my next tourist destination when the tour was over! He even has a sarong prepared for the tourists like myself who wear shorts while entering the temple. The rate was a lot cheaper than other tours and it does vary depending on your itinerary :) Overall I can't sing enough praise for this man. If you book with him, you'll be in good hands. And just a tip, please don't be a rude, disrespectful or extremely picky tourist. He is a guide-not a servant.Thanks Wayan! I'll be emailing you soon for my airport transport!"

He was also very helpful making sure the tour was according to our interests and even made a suggestion and extra trip for my partner. He was also very informative and entertaining, explaining to us a lot about the Balinise culture and Hinduism in Bali. The only sad thing I have to say is that our trip was too short that we regret not booking it a bit longer so we could still explore Bali more with Wayan Suka and with Amansuka tours. On our last night, my husband and I were already talking about our next visit to Bali and still booking with Amasuka Tours. Very professional, polite and friendly. The best of Bali!"

We visited a number of temples, one being the Holy Spring Temple. This was so great to see as so many people were involved in the religious cleansing ritual! We visited a traditional Balinese Home, art gallery, waterfall, volcanoe, rice terraces, wood carving, coffee plantation and even a ceremony taking place at a temple in a local village. Our day was packed full but it flew by so quickly. The best part of the trip was Amansuka himself, so knowledgeable of Balinese custom, he accompanied us whereever we wanted to go and went to great lengths to explain everything we wanted understand! Amansuka's English was great, he was very funny and also quite spiritual; we learnt some great lessons about ourselves and about how life should really be lived. \"Always smile, it costs nothing and most of all, be happy!\" We highly recommend having a tour and spending a day with him."

He was quick to respond to all of my emails, as we changed plans on him a couple of times. From the second he picked us up, he was energetic and friendly and he speaks wonderful English. He has really funny jokes, too.We chose to do a tour that he recommended, visiting the Monkey Forest, a balinese house, waterfall, coffee plantation, volcano, and the rice fields. It was so much to see in one day!! He accompanied us to the Monkey Forest, which I appreciated because I would have been very skiddish to give monkeys bananas, but he ensured us it was safe, and it was so fun! He recommended a great place for us to eat lunch overlooking a volcano and took pictures of us during the entire trip. After our day tour, he asked us if we wanted transportation to the airport. He was cheaper than our resort, so we said yes, but our flight didn't leave until 1 am. Wayan dropped us off in the city to get massages and dinner, picked us back up and then drove us to the airport with very short notice! Most of all, my favorite part was listening to his lessons on Balinese lifestyle and insight, which I found extremely inspiring. He literally made me want to move to Bali and live life like they do! Thank you Wayan for the best day! Highly highly recommend using him for your day(s) in Bali!!"

However the tour was a big disappointment. As it turns out this company works with several guides named Wayan (as it is the name given to firstborns in Bali) and not all of them are equally good guides. Reading the reviews and looking at the website one can get the impression that there is only one Wayan. This is not the case, but they failed to clear this up.Our guide was quite different from what you can read here. His English wasn't good and therefore it was hard to follow his blurry explanations you really had to concentrate to get like at least half of it. He brought us to all the must see places of course, but any driver could have done that for less. We didn't get any information on Balis history, and had to look up all the places afterwards. On the first day he brought us to a very touristy restaurant at lake Batur. It was a fishy looking badly presented buffet lunch at a price for 135k/person. It was a rip off considering the quality of food and considering that we had very nice food throughout our stay in Indonesia for a lot less. When we told him, he said that there one has to pay for the view and not for the food. Next day we ended up eating at a similar place. When we told him that we are not impressed at all, he said that two months ago it was a good place maybe they had changed the chef since... Then I have checked Tripadvisor again, as I could not believe that this service has so good reviews and only then did I realise that the guy smiling on the pictures here in the reviews is not the guy driving the car I am sitting in. Huge disappointment.I am sure that our Wayan is a really nice person as well, I am sure he did his best, but we expected more and the whole story felt like a tourist scam. We had several drivers during our stay here in Bali and this service was in no ways better than theirs only more expensive. We would have been better off with 'just a driver' and looking up all the stories for ourselves. We just thought a guide would be a nice treat at the end of our stay in Bali.At the end my husband tried to tell him how disappointed we are but obviously he only understood 'tripadvisor' and 'compliment' instead of 'complaint' as he encouraged us to write a review so they get better rankings. It was very sad."

I did the Singaraja Lovina tour, visiting the stunning Ulun Danu Bratan temple where we arrived before the tour buses and we stumbled on a local religious ceremony - Wayan explained to me what was happening, so I was able to appreciate it much more than I would have if I'd found it on my own. We also went to a beautiful waterfall (note: the walk to Gitgit Waterfall is somewhat difficult, but Wayan was patient with me), had a relaxed lunch on a quiet beach, and visited a scenic monastery and an interesting holy hot spring - I thought the itinerary sounded very ambitious, but we got through everything, and I didn't feel rushed.I booked direct with Amansuka Tours by email - it was easy to do since Wayan usually replied to my emails within 24 hours. He offered an airport transfer, that was great too - Wayan's nephew (he was lovely but I've forgotten his name) picked me up at the airport with my name on a sign, we had a really interesting chat on the long drive to Ubud, and he even gave me a free orientation drive around town. I also asked for a transfer to my next hotel in Seminyak, that too was a fun ride with Wayan's nephew.I paid just 60USD for the day tour, an amazingly good deal - Viator charges about twice that, and I think (based on prior experience elsewhere in South East Asia) hotels would also charge twice that if you ask them to arrange a guide for you. For each transfer I paid 25USD, that's slightly more than what online searches say the taxi fare is, but I think it's worth paying a little more to feel as safe as I felt with this company."

Because our time is Bali was so short, we were able to customize a tour which touched on everything we wanted to see (a remote waterfall, temples, a great spot for lunch over looking a volcano and much more). I highly recommend this tour for anyone visiting Bali!"

He taught us how to pray while in Bali, always went out if his way to ensure we experienced the culture-bringing coconut water, asking what we like to see/visit to ensure our trip was special and meaningful to us. We were lucky to have him for a whole week! He shows us the entire island of Bali, from Ubud to the east and north. I have a huge appreciation for Bali's culture and temples because of Wayman. His teachings and guiding added so positivity into my life. Also, as female traveler always felt very safe. He is the best guide you could possibly find (his long trail of reviews are proof) and would recommend no other guide when visiting Bali. I feel very fortunate that our paths crossed!"

I used them for a custom made trip to the North of Bali and then for a my return to the airport.. all at reasonable prices. Airport from Ubud was 300k and the trip to the north 750k. Both the drivers were very helpful, very knowledgeable and had good English.. They are happy to help you with an itinerary and add in things of added interest.. Note that there are a team of drivers so you may not get the boss man.. but this shouldn't concern you I also met another of the team whilst out and about and all of them seem fantastic .. would highly recommend"

My booking was rather spontanous after I arrived in Bali, the reply to my inquiry came promptly.I asked to arrange the morning market tour so that I can end up in Tanah Lot for the sunset, and Wayan came up with his suggestion to include Ulun Danu Bratan temple and Jatiluwih rice terrace instead of the volcano. Wayan was always attentive, quick to learn my preferences, always polite and ready to chat and answer my questions. I went to Ubud without planning much sightseeing, but the day was worth it and Wayan made it so. The rice terrace was beautiful. It was a hot day but Wayan patiently walked with me. Too bad that the sun set was cloudy, but we compensated it with a banana pancake with a view of Tanah Lot and the ocean. Maybe it was menat to be, now I have another reason to come back to Bali, nice clear sun set at Tanah Lot.So thank you Wayan, hope to see you again sometime, in my next visit."

Wayan took us to the local market and we picked out some fruit and tried a couple other interesting snacks. One being a rice and banana snack all wrapped up in a banan leaf. It was really delicious. Our guide explained so much to us about local traditions and rituals and answered the millions of questions I had. Following there we went to a locals house and hung out with a family. We got to see their home and the way they live. This was a heart warming experience. The one man was an amazing painter. I just loved his work so much I refused to leave without one of his pieces to take home. I'm very grateful to be able to hang his work up at home. He also had a niece about 2 years old and she was just adorable. She melted my heart. We also visited the rice terrace which was so beautiful. Wayan knew all the good trails to take and tips to avoid additional costs by taking photos with the workers etc . He also demonstrated his skills in the bamboo drums ( I don't remember the actual name for the instrument) but Wayan was really good. We then proceeded to lunch with a stunning view of the active volcano. We had the choice of eating at the fancy touristy restaurant or the local one across the street. We chose to the local one and it was very very good. We then proceeded to holey water temple. Thank goodness for Wayan being so prepared. I forgot all about the appropriate attire for the temple and he had come with extra sarongs which worked out awesome. Wayan knew the history and legendary stories of the temple which was so fascinating. It felt very majestic walking around, kind of like the eat pray love vibe. I really enjoyed it. Lastly we headed to the waterfall. This was fun,great views. (Tons of stairs) cool spot for pictures. We didn't go swimming but we did cross and hike up the other side of the cliff which was stunning. I really couldn't say enough positive things about this tour and our guide. He made our trip in ubud so memorable. I learnt so much from him and am so grateful to have met him. I highly recommend doing this tour. "

My wife and 9yo son were picked up from our hotel in Ubud at 8:30a and we had a team meeting about where and what we wanted to do & see. Wayan also made some suggestions that complimented the all-day private tour e.g. visiting a traditional/authentic Balinese home (with people inside going about their daily business) and a swim at the nearby waterfall. Wayan engaged us in the history of Bali including the Hindu religion and rituals. We visited the usual tourist areas such the volcano, monkey forest and temples but a nice unscheduled side stop was to a coffee plantation where we tasted the famous 'Bucket List' lewak coffee. The whole day was zero stress or no stop offs being driven to pre-determined shops (like is typically done in China). Wayan was keen to take us to wherever we wanted to go for a long as we liked. We eventually 'tapped out' at 4:30p and arrived back at our hotel. We were so impressed with the service and value for money that we've engaged Wayan again tomorrow to see some more Balinese towns up until we fly home tomorrow evening."

Right from our first contact with Wayan, to the confirmation email, the prompt timing of pick-ups at our separate addresses (one in Seminyak, we were in Ubud) to the abundance of knowledge about Bali and the Hindu culture, the humour and value for money, I have to say that Wayan went above and beyond to make sure our day trip was a most memorable, informative and enjoyable experience.We saw the natural beauty of the waterfall at Tegenungan, the magnificence of the volcano at Kintamani (where Wayan said he preferred to take us to the quieter restaurant rather than the huge ones where the coach loads go) and the rice terraces just outside of Ubud at Tegallalang.Wayan gave us a deep insight into Balinese life and the Hindu culture and answered every question we asked with both a beautiful humility as well as a touch of cheeky humour. We visited a Balinese house, the Batuan temple and Tirta Empul (the holy water temple). The temple was founded in the 11th century but what impressed me most was the depth of Wayan's knowledge historically and factually, but also the mythology of the holy temple and the Hindu tradition of the Balinese.We could not have asked for a better day! And as for value for money, I had to send an email to re-confirm that it was correct. The price was per tour, not per person and at U$60 with two pick ups and a 7 hour day, we couldn't believe it. Just remember to take some extra cash for donations to temples of nominal entrance fees, a dollar here, a couple of dollars there, 3 dollars to enter Kintamani. It's all explained in the confirmation email from Wayan.Next time, we are in Bali we will do a day trip to West Bali and we will be calling Wayan. Thank you for showing us the best of Bali, you are the best of Bali.See you, next time, Martin & the gang"

He also advised if there was anything extra we wanted to do just let him know and he would be happy to. He arrived perfectly on time and from the minute we got in his modern air conditioned car, I immediately liked him. He was so happy and friendly but so knowledgable. Everything we drove past he would let us know of its significance and I learnt more about Bali and Balonese people in that day than I did for my entire trip. The sights we saw were beautiful and it was by far my best day in Bali. For the sake of $50 between us for the whole day, with our own private tour guide, it was just such great value for money! He knew EVERYTHING. I really really cannot stress enough how incredible Wayan was. These reviews certainly were not lying! He told us so much about their culture and religious beliefs and showed us places that we would have no idea existed just by looking on Google. If you are considering a tour to do whilst in Ubud you will regret it if you don't book with him. It's probably the best value for money I've ever got. Wayan is a wonderful man, and Ubud is an incredibly beautiful place. I will never forget yesterday, ever.

When we booked Wayan at the last minute I braced myself for the possibility of reckless driving, hard to understand English, or being subjected to a lot of info we could easily find ourselves on the Internet. What a wonderful relief. Wayan was none of those things. Actually, he was the polar opposite. He crafted a remarkable day, tailored for our interests. He imparted his great knowledge of Balinese history and culture in a way that made me want to hear more. We had an amazing day. I would not hesitate to recommend Wayan to anyone who wants to get better acquainted with beautiful Bali."

Not only did we get to see the Ubud countryside (waterfall, volcano, temples and rice terraces) but also Wayan was so informative about all the places we visited and taught us much about the Balinese way of life. Wayan is very easy to talk to and a joy to be around. Like an old friend! I hope we meet again one day :)"

He passed on lots of great information about Balinese culture, religion and philosophy to give us a greater understanding of Bali life.His car was modern and clean and he provided us with bottles of water and cold wet towels after a hot walk! We were two young women (aged 27) and felt very comfortable with Wayan. Would definitely recommend and use again."

We hired Wayan for a day trip while we were in Ubud. He tailored the day based on my requests- some specific and some more general- ie \"We would like to see a waterfall\". We could not have been more pleased with the sights that we took in and felt that we saw so much in just a day. Wayan arrived promptly at the time he had quoted in a very clean van. His driving was excellent which says a lot as Bali driving is not easy. He was extremely informative at each stop and welcomes questions, delivering his answers with impeccable English. He offered to take photos for us at each stop and always had the best tips for getting the most out of each place. I don't think I spend better money during our stay in Bali. If you want to see a lot in a short period of time, and are looking for both transport as well as background knowledge on the places that you are going- then Wayan is the guide for you."

He tailored the trip to our interests and needs, adjusting schedule when needed. Very candid, attentive, sweet with children. We were four adults and two children under 5 on a cultural and heritage tour spiced with a coffee/cocoa plantation visit. We have learned more in a day about Balinese people and culture then in a whole week since our arrival. If we ever come back to Bali, will definately get in touch for an other tour!"

And boy, were we glad we got him. He showed us many many beautiful views, a dance, temples, a random regular Balinese house (apparently you can just walk in any traditional Balinese home) and explained its composition, talked of many nice stories of his religion and their views, and shared a lot of interesting facts about their culture and way of living. We saw monkeys, waterfalls, a volcano, royal temple, markets, a guy climbing a palm tree bare handed to let me drink from a fresh coconut etc etc.Wayan Suka, \"your friend\" (as he calls himself), was insanely kind, super funny and very knowledgeable. We HAD to see him again, so we asked him to bring us to the airport few days later.Few tips: (1) ask him about: smiles, problems, and positivity. Very inspiring views.(2) don't let your hotel organize this tour. It cost us 15 dollars more because the resort claimed a part."

Amansuka Tour is professional, efficient, friendly, knowledgable, honest, and they know their way around the island. I am a single 60 year old female and it was my first time to Bali, so I was a bit nervous at first to hire a private driver who could show me around the island and suggest a few places I would like to visit. I am forever grateful to the people I met in Kuta at the beginning of my trip who recommended Amansuka Tour. I felt very safe with their excellent drivers. Their english is also excellent and if you are not sure where or how you would like to spend your day having fun in the sun, they will give you excellent suggestions. Amansuka Tour is an absolute must. I had two separate drivers and both of them were just the best ever. Plus, their prices are very reasonable. I would use them again in a second."

We saw all the major sites - Sacred Monkey Forest, Elephant Rides, Coffee Region, Waterfall - and he showed us some interesting and beautiful things we wouldn't have found otherwise - some local craftspeople and traditional Balinese houses. Prices were fair and schedule was accommodating. Highly recommended!"

I have been coming to Bali regularly since 2010, where I first met Wayan Suka, and each time I visit I always use his services, whether it's a transfer from the airport or a day trip to villages, temples, sightseeing or exploring. I've met many drivers in Bali in the past 6 years and none of them come close to Wayan's personable and professional service. He really is your friend in Bali."

He is very trustworthy and helped give us tips on how to barter and deal with aggressive, pushy merchants. We were looking for some handmade art, and he helped us figure out the best shops to visit for the style and price range we were looking for. He also gave great explanations of the cultural and religious beliefs and helped us understand Bali culture in a way that would have taken us weeks or months to learn on our own. The people of Bali are deeply religious and spiritual, and Amansuka helped us experience that part of their life. I am leaving Bali with a new found respect for Hindu and the Balinese. I am extremely glad when went with Amansuka."

He was funny too, so it made our long days very pleasant. He provided us with information not only of the temples and other tourist attractions, but also of the daily life in Bali. We spent three days with him and explored the best parts of the island in a very efficient way. Before we arrived to Bali, he created an amazing itinerary for us, based on the list we created for him of all the things we wanted to see. He was always on time and came very well prepared with cold water and cold towels. And even though we were busy, he was always flexible to do things as we went. He was always very polite and kind, and his personality reminded me of Ketut, the healer from Eat, Pray, Love! Bali definitely capture our hearts and Wayan was definitely part of it."

His guided tour through the local market was fascinating, seeing exotic fruits such as the snakeskin fruit we'd never before sampled. He brought us to a number of temples, careful to make sure we were appropriately dressed to enter. He located an excellent restaurant with a terrific view of the rice terraces where we had lunch.

Both tours felt very tailored to us and Wayan was very sensitive to my abilities with the temple steps and the sticky heat! He even stopped to give me a little bit of reflexology when the heat got to my head. I felt as though I learned so much more about Balinese culture than I would have if we had directed ourselves and it was particularly special to spend some time in the morning market and a Balinese home which gave us a taste of what Balinese life is really like. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him."

The scenery is amazing (Tanah Lot takes some beating), but in this case it was Wayan who made it memorable. His attitude to life was amazing and his love of Bali shone throughout the day."

Wayan expertly suggested an itinerary that encompassed everything we wanted to see and do, working around our limited time scales (and including some extra suggestions for things we hadn't even considered).Then, on the tour itself, he was full of interesting information about Bali, it's people and their culture - exactly what we wanted.He was also very flexible with the itinerary we had, so when we passed preparations for a special ceremony he was happy for us to stop, have a closer look and meet the locals.The car was also clean, spacious and very comfortable.All in all, a brilliant tour with an excellent tour guide - thank you Wayan!"

He knew so much about Bali, and he also had great marriage advice (seriously!).There was one hiccup - in our emails with Wayan prior to our tour date, we scheduled a tour with him to pick us up from Seminyak and drive us to Ubud (our next location). The day before our tour, I emailed confirming what time he would pick us up and let him know what hotel we were at in Seminyak (a well known hotel). Wayan misunderstood and also couldn't read the entire email, so he went to our hotel in Ubud to pick us up the next morning. But we were waiting for him in Seminyak. After emails and calling him, we agreed to continue with the day, and Wayan drove to Seminyak to pick us up. We started the day an hour and a half after we had planned (11:00 instead of 9:30), which was a bummer, but we're confident that this was a one time hiccup for Wayan. He was apologetic, and we understood the miscommunication. Not a big deal for us (we're pretty relaxed), but just something to keep in mind in terms of confirming with him!"

We wanted to see some of Bali, but the real life and not just the tourist attractions. Asked him to make a program. The price was very reasonable.Wayan picked us up at 9 and we went to a local market. By coincidence we witnessed a huge ceremony at this village. Beautiful. We toured the market and Wayan, being a farmer himself, was able to explain a lot.From there we went to a ricefield where we made a walk and talked with him about Bali agriculture, met some farmers on the way. Interesting.Time to go for a Bali coffee at a street stand. Across the street a ceremony was going on in a temple and Wayan gave us the proper dress to attend the ceremony. There was cock fighting, dance, a lot of offering and we felt welcome. It was impressive and the explanations of Wayan helped understanding all of it.From here we went to visit a Balinese house and again the explanations were very good.After a lunch at a local warung we went to see a big temple (forgot the name) and on to Tanah Lot. Actually, you probably need to see Tanah Lot, but for us the rest of the day had been much more interesting.We really enjoyed this tour. Wayan is a pleasant, open guy to talk to. He is very knowledgeable and explains it all very well. A great day !!! Thanks Wayan."

That was huge for me because I wanted to get out of the touristy areas, which meant traveling further out and on some rougher roads! By the end of an amazing two days, we were more than happy to give Wayan some extra tip money because of his amazing attitude and services. We also felt so safe and taken care of with Wayan, which was important for us as two young women traveling around Bali. Wayan took us to a VERY local market after hearing that we wanted to eat some local fare. While we were scarfing down suckling pig, Wayan bought us a drink that soothes stomachs (to prevent \"Bali belly\") and bought me several coconut peanut snacks found at local markets, which he had also overheard me saying I loved-- so so sweet of him!! I could not get over his hospitality. He also taught me a little Hindu life lesson about appreciating the good and forgetting the bad. This helped me through the next day when I had a terrible sunburn- I just reminded myself of the amazing adventures that lead me to the pain of the sunburn :). Thanks again for everything Wayan!!"

The car was comfortable, I appreciated to have water and refreshing towels after visits, and I personally like to have a guide like him, who will crack a joke every once in a while. We used his services for 3 days, and even though we probably didn't see all of what Bali has to offer, he clearly gave us a good insight of the Balinese culture. We started our tour on day one from Sanur and finished in Ubud from where we saw most of the center on day 2. For our last tour he drove us until Jimbaran and showed us very nice sites on the way trying to avoid al the touristic crowd. I highly recommend him, he's very flexible, and a very safe driver. He always have good suggestion on what to see and if you feel like doing something different during the day you can always change your plans last minute. If it's possible, he will help you.

He also knows a lot about Balinese fruit and vegetables so on each place we visited, he showed us which fruits and vegetables we saw and we have also tasted several of them. Thanks to suka, we saw the real Bali!!"

We ended up going to a traditional Balinese market, hiking to a waterfall, visiting a local household, seeing three amazing temples, stopping by a wood carving village, having lunch overlooking a volcano, and visiting a local coffee plantation. The day was planned perfectly and we felt like we were quickly immersed in all the culture Bali had to offer. Wayan was so much more than a tour guide-- he made us feel so welcome and was incredibly fun to be around. We ended up booking him as our driver for the remainder of the trip. It was great to have a local's insight, especially in a not-so-touristy area (we stayed in Ubud for most of our trip). I would 100% recommend his tours to everyone visiting Bali, and I would definitely be booking another tour when I visit again!"

            "review": "Professional, Insightful, and Fun!. My boyfriend and I visited Bali for the first time in March 2015. After doing a bit of research online, we decided that it would be best to hire a driver to take us around each day, rather than depending on taxi\u2019s. I found Wayan Amansuka through Trip Advisor and after reading all of his wonderful reviews, decided to book him for the week. From the first communication, I was extremely impressed by Wayan. He was very professional and friendly in all of his emails. He read through the itinerary we put together and provided great feedback on how to make it better. He included prices for each of the daily tours and called out any entrance fees that may apply. Wayan\u2019s prices are also very reasonable, ranging from $50-60 USD for 8-10 hours of driving and $30 USD for airport transfers. Some may say that you can find cheaper drivers on the street, but I can guarantee they won\u2019t be as good as Wayan Amansuka! Before leaving for our trip, we felt comfortable and confident in Wayan and his team and were excited to meet him at the airport. Unfortunately, our flight arrived late and we had no way to contact Wayan. However, as soon as we got through customs, we saw Wayan waiting to greet us with a big smile! Over the next week, we hung out with Wayan and team for 3 day tours and 2 hotel/airport transfers. Wayan\u2019s nephew, Arjana, took us on a tour of South Kuta, Wayan\u2019s best friend, Madea, took us on a tour to Lovina, and Wayan himself accompanied us on a tour to North Kuta\u2026all of which was amazing! With Amansuka and team, you will feel comfortable, safe, and most importantly, you will have a great time! Wayan and team were always punctual in picking us up and also flexible with our plans throughout the day. If we wanted to stop for photos or to grab something to eat, they did so without hesitation. We truly felt that they were there to accommodate us and make sure that we were having a great time. They also provided HEAPS of great information. We can honestly say that the best part of our trip was learning about the culture and religion in Bali. Something else to point out is the fact that Wayan and team are all awesome drivers. If you have ever been to Bali you know how chaotic the roads are. We had no idea what to expect and let\u2019s just say that we were SO thankful to have Wayan and team driving us around. Wayan and team also had clean, reliable cars with air conditioning. They provided us with bottled water and even whipped out little snacks every now and then. With Wayan and team, conversation also flowed easily. We spent a lot of time in the car driving and never once did we feel awkward or uncomfortable. Overall, we were very satisfied with the services we received from Wayan Amansuka and team and would highly recommend them to anyone visiting Bali. Thank you Wayan and team for showing us your beautiful country and for creating amazing memories with us!"

My brother and I spent two days with Wayan at the beginning of a three week trip to Indonesia and a month later we're still talking about those two days! From our first communication with Wayan via email, to our final goodbyes at the airport, our experience was first-rate. We contacted Wayan a few weeks before our trip explaining the kind of cultural experiences we hoped to have. He didn't disappoint. We saw intriguing historical sites, walked the beautiful ricefields at Tegalalang, visited a traditional family compound, and enjoyed some gorgeous scenery. But talk about going above and beyond - - - - Wayan had also contacted friends in the area about unique ceremonies/celebrations that might be taking place while we were there. As a result, he was able to take us to temples and small villages where we saw some very special and traditional activities. Joining a once-every-thirty-years procession (wearing traditional sorongs and headress provided by Wayan) is just one example of the incredible experiences we had on our tour! Everything others have said about his demeanor is true. He is kind, funny, thoughtful, knowlegable, charming, sincere and committed to providing you a memorable experience you'll never forget. Terima Kasih, Wayan!"

He knows everything about Bali and clearly enjoys sharing his knowledge and experience. He is a very safe and competent driver and knows and understands the streets of Bali like the back of his hand. He has a calm and gentle personality and is sensitive to his surroundings. If we had many questions, he was comfortable conversing with us about anything. If we wanted some quiet, he was respectful and not intrusive. Even though we only had one day with him, I feel like we got to see and understand something about Bali, not just through the sights that he brought us to, but also in spending time with him. He patiently answered all of our questions and provided a window of insight into the Balinese culture that we will remember long after we have forgotten the places we visited. His love for his people and culture is evident and he clearly enjoys his job. Wayan was well-prepared for the trip, including umbrellas for the rain and sarongs so that we could enter the temple. He brought us to the places that we were interested in and was never pushy about us going particular places or buying anything. He never rushed us and was highly competent in every way. It was a thoroughly enjoyable day and I would highly recommend Amansuka Tours to anyone visiting Bali for whatever reason."

He was friendly, knowledgeable and I felt we got to see a bit of Wayan's Ubud. Wayan was a refreshing guide compare to the guide who picked us up at the airport--she was trying to 'sell' us on her company's various tours.

I decided then to also add arrival transfers for 4 of us arriving to Ubud. Wayan was there with a sign and a big friendly smile. I also arranged for him to collect our friends the following afternoon which was not a problem. The day tour to Lovina was good fun. A long drive but we wanted to check out some of the out-of-the-way places. We were due to go to Git Git waterfall but as I'd been before he suggested an alternative. The 6 of us ended up at nungnung waterfall. It was AMAZING!! We were the only travellers there and we swum as close as we could to the roaring water. So much fun. A steep climb of about 400 steps each way so it's not for the faint hearted. We also visited Ulun Danu Bratan temple. Wayan organised for his nephew to help take us all down to Legian on our departure. No problems whatsoever. I highly recommend Wayan and will contact him again on our next visit (and hope that he's not booked out which may be the case as word gets out about his super service and reliability. I found the pricing of his transfers and day tours very affordable so we made sure to tip him a bit extra for his time. ps... We loved his jokes - had us all in stitches! See you next time Wayan : )"

On the day he picked us up on time in a very clean, late model vehicle with excellent air conditioning.He was so friendly and put us at ease immediately letting us know where we would be going first. He very kindly arranged for us to go to Bali Bird Park as the first stop on our tour as he knew this was when the birds would be most active and we would be there in time to see one of their great shows.After the bird park he had cold bottles of water waiting for us and later in the day he had more water and cold towels to refresh ourselves which was a thoughtful touch and very much appreciated.We also stopped at a Luwak coffee plantation, Goa Gajah, Tirta Empul and Tegalalan Rice Terrace. At each of these stops Wayan was an excellent and informative guide, providing us with so much information we that really added to our experience. At lunch he took us to a wonderful restaurant, Bebek Tepi Sawah, which turned out to be one of the best meals we had on our holiday. Wayan was happy to take photos for us and answer any of our questions. He tells some hilariously bad jokes too - such a funny man!Wayan offered to make other stops after our last stop, including a tour of a Balinese home, which we were not able to do on the day but I will most definitely be back and will book Wayan for a few days to do this and more.I often travel alone and have hesitated to book private tours in the past for safety reasons - I would absolutely book Wayan when I am travelling alone in future. He is trustworthy, speaks excellent English and is a good driver. I can't speak highly enough of him.Thank you for a wonderful day Wayan, from Karma and Gen."

He has so much love and enthusiasm for Balinese culture - its such a pleasure just being in his company. When we eventually made it to Ubud, Wayan picked us up each morning and took us around for nearly 8 hours each day. We stopped at all of the major temples, the elephant safari, monkey forest, coffee plantation, rice paddies and more. He knew all of the best places to sit and enjoy the incredible sites.

Wayan picked me up at the airport and impressed me from the very start. His enthusiasm for sharing his love of the Balinese culture is infectious. On the drive to my hotel, he was already pointing out notable sights and introducing me to the local culture and traditional practices. As a female that was traveling alone, I felt very safe with Wayan as my guide. He was always very polite, a safe driver, and a great teller of jokes. He even helped me locate my hotel - which was located down a dodgy little alleyway at night. Later in my stay, Wayan took a friend and I on a private tour, sprinkling fun facts throughout a day visiting temples, rice paddies, and even a Balinese home. When we wanted to do a bit of shopping, he even went ahead and negotiated better prices than tourists would ever be able to secure alone. In addition, every time we stopped at a new location, he would pull a new surprise out of the back of the car: local fruits, bottles of water, cooling cloths, and more. Because of Wayan, I feel as though I have more of an insider perspective of the culture and a resulting affection for it as well. You can tell that he truly loves where he comes from and wants to share that love with everyone he encounters. I am lucky to be able to call Wayan my friend, and I hope our paths will cross again one day."

I didn't have e-mail access the first week in Bali but he took the initiative to call the place I was staying to confirm the pick up time! Amazing because I was worried that he would have tried to contact me and I had no way of contacting him. I was really impressed by his initiative and determination. He picked me up on time and took me to several places, during the drive he explained Bali culture, education, marriage, etc-shared so much and I learned a tremendous amount on the drive with him. He is also great at taking photos based on what he's learned from other tourist. He is funny and likes to tell jokes. Unfortunately I needed to be picked up at 10 instead of the suggested 8am and it cut the tour short since it was too dark to see anything- so keep that in mind. Most drivers will charge you what Wayan Amansuka will charge you without the tour guide knowledge and experience.

            "review": "Can't Recommend Wayan Enough. Wayan is an exceptional guide and driver, knowledgeable, sensitive courteous and scrupulously honest. Wayan is a native of Ubud who is clearly passionate about helping visitors understand his culture and religion and the way it pervades the everyday life of locals in Ubud. He does this in a very sincere and matter of fact way without ever slipping into the Western pandering mysticism that sometimes cloaks Bali. He will tell you about how he and everyone else grew up learning the traditional arts. He will tell you about growing rice and how his family still growth their own today. He will tell you the meaning of all the little decorative offerings in front of homes. He will tell you where to find quality local art or jewellery but only if you ask. He will never push you to go shopping. Wayan is also an accredited and fully licensed Indonesian Guide. This is very important if you want to visit the Mother Temple of Besakih, which is frankly a must-see in Bali. Unfortunately, the Mother Temple is plagued by organized thugs that demand 100,000+ Rp from each visitors as is well documented on TripAdvisor. The only people they will not bother are those accompanied by a licensed Indonesian Guide. We walked straight in having only paid the de minimus actual admission fee and had access to the entire temple including those areas for locals only. Wayan's knowledge of the Temple far exceeding anything in the guide books and he turned what for many is a horrible Balinese experience into one of our best Balinese experiences. Wayan's rates are very reasonable and just a slight premium over the cheapest drivers you can find. He charged me 550,000 Rp (about US$60) for a 10 hour tour all over Bali. Frankly, for the money you spend getting to Bali, you would be crazy to go with someone other than Wayan because of price."

We made an effort to keep in touch with him in case we get the opportunity to visit the amazing Ubud again. Felt like we made a friend vs just hiring him for a service. On top of that he was always on time, helped you avoid tourist trap locations, was incredibly flexible, taught you about the culture of Bali, car was clean and stocked with cool water, and always followed up to ensure any arrangements he made were taken care of properly. Just an overall amazing person!"

He is a careful driver with whom we felt completely safe.

Like other reviewers on here we booked before we went with Wayan because of his quick and courteous emails and the considered advice that he gave us regarding the most appropriate tours and use of our time. Wayan's high level of customer service continued from there. He always ensured that we saw what we wanted and that we had the time that we wanted at each location. He was happy to adjust the day throughout as we saw fit without hesitation. I cannot recommend his services enough if you want to get out and see some of Bali beyond the tourist hot-spots. Wayan's knowledge is fantastic and he shares it in an enthusiastic yet not overbearing way. Wayan will welcome you like an old friend and treat you with the same warmth and hospitality. Initially we booked to spend one day with Wayan however because we enjoyed the first day so much we booked a second day as soon as we could. We probably would have booked another if we had the time as we saw so much of Bali that we wouldn't have done without a knowledgeable, friendly and enthusiastic guide. On the second day of touring with Wayan my other half and Wayan were talking about how much we had enjoyed the local sambal. The next day before we left to travel home Wayan delivered some homemade sambal to our hotel so that we could enjoy the taste of Bali for a bit longer once we arrived home. You certainly don't get that service from many places at all!Like I say, I highly recommend at least one day touring Bali with Wayan. It is certainly well worth the money you will pay."

I would highly recommend Aman Suka as your guide/driver in UBUD Bali.A gentleman with fantastic insight and knowledge of Bali and its culture and tour attractions. I hired Suka for a half day tour of Thana Lot Temple and surrounding area. I felt very comfortable in his company and he was well priced, well mannered, and was very fluent in english - great communication skills. Your friend in Bali...give him a call!! Jodi"
