Either you are just going to read a book or to workout Vondelpark is a beautiful place, that is so lively and shows a lot of the Dutch culture and its diversity. Great for seeing beautiful birds around and handsome Dutch men jogging haha!"

I love running in new cities, find it a great way to see some early morning sites and get my bearings.Vondelpark was a couple of km's from my hotel, so was an obvious choice for my run. Nice walk / run there over the canals and along the deserted streets, and then find this wonderful park to play in.Wide open roads if you want to run on tar. Plenty of grass if you want to run on the soft stuff. And sandy paths if you want something in between.Plenty of trees to provide shelter from the sun if it was hot.The scenery was beautiful. Rolling green lawns, large trees, ponds & fountains.Loads of other people walking / running / roller-blading / cycling / dog-walking."

It s convenient for a walk, fresh air, a ride, some pick nick with friends, or to change ideas. However, the grass lacks maintenance, like one has in Paris or London, while some areas can be looud due to gatherings for barbecue or for concerts. There are a lot of dogs and ... poop!"

There's a restaurant and bar in the middle which was nice for some refreshments and it was a lovely, well kept park overall whether you want to go for a walk or a cycle."

We went to the t'Blauwe Theehuis, which is a bit of institution for locals. More of a summer spot though. You can get drinks and sandwiches there, its not expensive but more self service.

It is so picturesque, went to a local supermarket and got food for a picnic and sat on the grass and ate our lunch it was lovely, however the pigeons are a nuisance when trying to eat. There is an information box where my friends and I asked where you could hire bikes, which was just out of the park and round the corner. It was reasonably cheap, with 2 hours with insurance costing \u20ac10. The park is beautiful and there is unique parts of it which can be explored on foot or on bike. There is also places to eat, such as wee coffee vans or a restaurant/ cafe at the entrance of the park.Plenty to see and do"

The park is really nice but there are a LOT of cyclists (as you would expect!). Obviously it's great seeing so many people out getting some exercise and ditching the cars but it did feel a bit intense avoiding all the bikes and trying to work out where the best part of the path to walk without getting in someone's way would be!

Often larger parks have activities for younger children spaced out to keep them entertained but there was none of that here - just what seemed like thousands of cyclists!"

Great for picnics, it's a massive area, we didn't cover all of it as we wanted to do the nearby museums. Nice cafe , hidden away , and worth a visit. Seemed popular with the locals which I think is a good recommendat ion. Best of all though it's totally free!"

This beautiful park is equipped with all necessary amenities to enhance your visit (ie. food & toilets) but best of all it comes quite often with its very own entertainment (created by locals going about their every day leisure activities eg. Frisbi flying, hoola-hooping exercises and impromptu music gatherings.

Visiting Amsterdam, you must explore Vondelpark and as you meander around this vast expanse, experience the bird-life, the variety of plants and, most importantly, the locals as many whip around on cycles, some walking and others just watching the world go by. After a good breakfast at your hotel, should you be staying nearby, a walk around Vondelpark will set you up for the day!"

It's nice walking or biking in the park, looking at the small lakes and all the people that are gathered there. Take an hour and relax from the museums and canals."

The paths are wide and cater for everyone on push bikes to walkers and prams. Nice flat surface so no exertion required. Plenty of park benches to take a rest and people watch. Also there is lots of grassy area to picnic and loads of beautiful trees to shade you when walking or riding. We rode around and the stopped for a glass of wine and some lunch at the bar/restaurant located at the entrance to the park at the VondelCS. You can sit outside at the restaurant under umbrella's and enjoy the scenery. The food and wine were lovely."

Grab some snacks from an Albert hein supermarket and spread out on the grass round the lovely lakes and watch the world go by. In the summer and evenings especially, literally thousands will flock to set up small bbqs and music and relax away. This is great to see esp as all the locals clean well up after themselves so the council allows this to continue year on year. There is plenty of music in the live open theatre which you can get a ticket for but just sitting near on the grass will get you the background music for a great day. My fave park is Oosterpark just cause of how pretty it is but Vondlepark is awesome."

Like everyone, we have heard a lot of buzz about this park and how it's the biggest park in Amsterdam and one of the highest rated.. We went there around 6 PM to find the place very crowded with lots of bikes going through, it didn't feel as cozy or like a place you can have a romantic picnic/walk in. It wasn't even a weekend, though it was overcrowded with mostly families with kids and people going through the park with their bikes on their way home. I don't recommend the place for any romantic gatherings, maybe for a bike ride though riding in crowded places are not really my favorite thing to do."

If you have a lot on your list of places to see, put this nearer the bottom. I felt Amsterdam was stressful since I'm not used to bikes zooming past everywhere and crossing the street requires a whole new skill set to learn. Our hotel was across from the park so we walked all around it, but those pesky bikes still plagued me. I know they're good for the environment, but Amsterdam needs to accommodate pedestrians too!"

Although we originally intended to rent bikes and cycle around, walking to and around paid off as we came across a free open area for performances, with plenty of seating and platformed seating too. There were bar areas to get drinks from, and the bottle of wine we had here was our cheapest of the whole trip! Whilst we were there they had 2/3 different bands playing - which were very good to watch.Walking around the park was also very pretty, there are plenty of lovely little paths to take."

When I go to Vondelpark it is usually to chill with my friends or cycle around (both are more common during nice weather conditions ofcourse ).The park is just a regular city park in the centre. During sunny days it will be packed to the brim with people cycling, drinking a whine in the grass, enjoying the sun etc. Due to the fact that it is in the middle of the centre you will find a few street sleepers in the mornings and against the evening and they are not dangerous! Actually some are very filosophical If you want to have your own space during summer periods in parks I would recommend Haarlemmermeersebos. But thats a drive away. To a tourist Vondelpark may seem like a complete mess with all the people either normal or under influence of something; but the park truely represents the lifestyle of the Amsterdammers."

Urinals are OK for adult men, but taking children into the portaloos isn't an option, they were so dirty and stinking with no paper. I was really surprised.

Not many flowers, but plenty of varieties of trees and shrubs. Ducks and heron on pond. Nice areas to sit and relax, chat, picnic etc. No public toilets as far as we could see. (In fact in the whole of Amsterdam there appeared to be no public facilities sign posted. Even Starbucks didn't have a restroom available.)"

My fianc\u00e9 and I went there after visiting the zoo (maybe 10-15 minutes ride from Artis zoo). We had a great time! Beautiful fountains and huge patches of green. A lot of locals come here, especially when it's sunny outside. You can find locals in bikinis and bathing suites whenever there is sun!Don't forget to bring a picnic blanket, but don't worry about food. You can either buy food from carts / restaurants in the park or alternatively, we saw locals order pizza to the park using an app with gps location ( can't remember what it's called but definitely check it out - ask any local). PS Mind that in vondelpark locals are allowed to free their dogs (for people whom it may concern)."

Thoroughly worth a stroll after a visit to the museum area"

The obvious appeal is the somewhat placid atmosphere compared to the streets and canals of the city. That being said, it's a park. If you've got nothing better to do or need to wind down from a hectic itinerary, this is certainly a great place to do it. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest cramming it into an already overbooked schedule. Expect a sizable crowd, so if you are into people watching, this is right up your alley. If you are a little introverted, there is still enough space so that you don't feel claustrophobic. Many locals (and I'd guess tourists) enjoy the liberty of smoking marijuana on the grounds, as the smell is ubiquitous (as it is in many areas of Amsterdam).As with any city, this is still a nice escape from the hustle and bustle if you want to get away from (some) of it all."

I have to say, I find the very few negative reviews to be quite amusing. When I visit somewhere I like, I have a habit of looking up the poor reviews to check for any down sides. It seems the only people who disliked this park, are people who either don't like other people, or consider the public consumption of alcohol and cannabis to be for homeless and druggies. That is more a reflection of their own narrowmindedness getting the better of their experiences. One reviewer said \"Its boring, its just a bunch of people relaxing\". That sounds good to me! Unfortunately, I had no other option than to go to Amsterdam in the middle of the summer peak time, at the beginning of August. The city was extremely busy, but once you step into the open expanse of the park, although it had lots of people still, it was like a breath of fresh air away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city, despite still being in the heart of it. We walked through the main gates and immediately spotted some buskers playing unusual music, and some other performers walking on tight ropes and such. It was all very interesting. We walked further and the park continued to open up. People lay on the grass relaxing, and it had a serene and peaceful atmosphere. I loved how liberal and laid back the area was - people were very civilised and at peace as they enjoyed glasses of wine, cold beers, or the famous Amsterdam smoke in the sunlight. Small walkways and paths weaved in and out of various coves, streams and lakes, alongside wider main thoroughfares were cyclists, joggers and skateboarders cruised by. Dotted along the way there are monuments, flower displays and places of interest such as bars, and food dispensaries. One of the first open areas we came along had an outdoor stage with a live band setting up. Who hung around for a while and enjoyed a beer and some free live music at a wonderful concert we had not expected to attend! A beautiful oasis in the middle of the busy city. A great getaway to enjoy some scenery and relaxation. Great for a casual stroll ."

We were delighted with our visits to this park, the greenery and the sense of space is in direct contrast to the structured radial construction of Amsterdam city, where the crowds can be tiring. Vondel park offers a breathing space; a place to sit , or play Frisbee on the grass and the ultimate destination for avid people watchers. The bikes share the pathways of course, but after a couple of days in the city, watching out becomes second nature. If you hire bikes this is a family friendly place to enjoy cycling. Amsterdamers love their dogs, and all kinds of breeds (and owners) can be spotted.The water features are lovely, and for those interested in water management they show creative and practical ways to work with drainage. The wild birds ( herons,coots and ducks when we were there ) and butterflies thrive there. Have your camera ready for the statue of Vondel himself, the rose gardens and the fountains. The paths can be muddy after rain, so take care with little ones. The wilderness area in the park is just what its name suggests, and is kept as an oasis for birds, newts etc."

It was really popular - lots of groups of friends and couples just 'hanging out'; Amsterdam has a low children rate per capita so not even lots of demanding young ones! A chap's dog was swimming in the lake to cool down and both were friendly and sociable. Had a drink in the caf\u00e9 - not the most atmospheric but the barman happily changes my glass when I complained of lipstick on the rim. A really nice place to chill out."

Some people read while others chatted or dosed off. There was a cafe where you could get some food or drinks (beer, sodas etc...) and there is a toilet as well.

I could see why the people of Amsterdam love this green space because there is a lot of open space and a lot of beautiful trees, flowers, lakes, walking trails (and bike trails). Because it was so warm when we went, the park was packed with locals having picnic dinners and cookouts. There were people playing frisbee, and people just catching some evening sunshine (it didn't get dark until around 10pm). We tried the restaurant in the park on our second night. The food looked better than it tasted, but we were in such a beautiful atmosphere it almost didn't matter. I would have liked to have more time to just hang out and take nature photos in the park."

It's easy to reach by bike or by tram in the Museum district. It's teeming with cafes, people, greenery, grass, lakes and even a small outdoor concert where bands were performing. We enjoyed drinks and apple pie in one of the cafe's and locked our bikes up. A really lovely place. Well worth a visit even if just for an hour"

There is a an open air music venue with seating, bars etc and a very good band were playing Afro Cuban rhythms.

Great for taking a breather from the bustle of the more touristy City spots. Buy a picnic (and perhaps a couple of beers, as we did) from one of the nearby convenience stores and then go exploring! Even when it's very busy, you're sure to find a nice spot to sit and chill. Good for bird-watching near the ponds (lots of water fowl, herons and terns!) They also put on music and arts festivals - we visited on a sunny Sunday afternoon and there were bands and singers performing on a small amphitheatre near the centre of the park."

It's within walking distance of the Museum District and is a green retreat from the sometimes crowded streets of Amsterdam. Popular with locals, there are lots of people strolling, walking their dogs and cycling (of course) but there is space for everyone. If it's been raining there are well kept paths and lots of places to stop for a drink or, on fine days, grassy areas for sitting with some picnic seats. If you have children there are play areas and a large playground. Storks nest on the island in the area designated as a nature reserve. If you walk as far as the far end of the park from the Museum District there are some good places to eat on Amstelveenseweg, just turn left as you leave the park gates and you'll see them opposite and all along the road. Finally, if you have walked from the city centre all the way out to the park entrance on Amstelveenseweg and don\u2019t want to walk back, turn left, walk past the restaurants and down to the crossroads (3 -4 minute walk) where you'll find frequent trams to Museumplein, the shopping area and Central Station."

Its a huge park in size , you can really get a good workout by just doing one round. Because the seasons in Holland are quite define. The trees change its colour through every season . If you are there in the winter you can really feel the quiteness enclosing onto you . A good time to just enjoy and contemplate. Also in winter there ain't as many tourist , you can really enjoy the long walks and freshness of the trees. In the Summer its another story . Young and old people are having fun in the park, jogging , biking , playing music or picnicing ... you will hear music or seeing someone doing Tai Qi, Yoga or just taking a nap . Its really a safe park for children as well . Why not find a quite spot , sit down , observe and enjoy ."

The park was popular with runners and exercise classes, and a fantastic space for children to run around safely.

            "review": "Caleidoscopic outside experience in Amsterdam!. As a local, the Vondelpark is simply THE number 1 park that I map my city around. Similar to landmarks like the Rijksmuseum, the center with its canals, the Central Station, The Artis Zoo, and so many more of those one of a kind things that make up the city in someone's experience, the Vondelpark is one of the core elements of what makes Amsterdam the beautiful city that is and has always been. So, what makes the Vondelpark so special? Critics could arguably say that any park is just a park and not a landmark in itself. Well, there are parks and parks. This park is indeed a landmark by itself just by it's location. One could say it's the Central Park of Amsterdam (though there are many differences of course). The park brings together pretty much all layers of society, all cultural backgrounds and all leisure seekers that walk around in Amsterdam at any given time. Both the park's location as a central hub connecting the south of the center with the actual center (Leidseplein), and the easy going vibe in the park itself make it a continuously attractive place to go to and spend time in. And with sunshine and any decent temperature, you will feast your eyes on the many people that are walking, rollerskating and biking by, or are having a picknick in the green fields available everywhere in the park. You will see ad hoc gatherings of friends or a regular Friday evening kick off drink taking place in the park. The open air theater is also a local sought after favorite. And definitely worth mentioning here is the former Film Museum building, which still hosts an outside bar and terrace that is an absolutely perfect location for a pitstop in any walk, run, or bike ride through the park. All and all, if the weather is good to great, it's a must do when in Amsterdam. A perfect place to meet new people, just bring your food & drinks and mingle. And even with rainy weather, it's very peaceful to just walk around and relax. Additional tips: the bars on the adjacent Overtoom (main street bordering the west side of the park) are very popular places for students and yups. There are several excellent student and regular bars, as well as many restaurants with all kinds of specialties. Furthermore, if you got primed by my Film Museum remark, they moved that museum into a fantastic futuristic building on the other side of the Central Station (on the Amsterdam Noord side) and it's called EYE. As a nice contract to the historical sites, EYE is definitely worth a visit as well. If you like movies and would like to see it in hands down the most beautiful and historic movie theater in Amsterdam, go to the main hall in Tuschinski, located just off the Rembrandt square (Rembrandtplein)."

If you want to be a classic tourist and rent bikes in Amsterdam, but are scared of riding on the roads, I recommend renting them and riding around vondelpark (there's a place to rent bikes round the corner from the park). That way you get to see more of the park and have a classic Amsterdam experience without the threat of death from crazy dutch drivers! A very pretty park, was a lovely stop off on our travels!"

There are a few interesting sculptures, one of Vondel the seventeenth century poet and name giver of the park, and one late work by Picasso.On sunny days you will find the grassy meadows crowded with people enjoying the sun and having picknicks.In spring tome you might see a stork flying overhead, it sometimes has its nest high up in one of the more secluded areas, owls, woodpeckers and Nile geese and ducks also have their nests in the abundant trees."

Unfortunately, so did the entire population of Amsterdam - gardens are very few and far between in the city so everyone heads here when the sun is out! It was seriously overcrowded with people coming after work. As pedestrians we were squashed towards the side of the paths to make room for the bikes. So much for a relaxing stroll...! I think it would be particularly stressful as a tourist to cycle under such conditions. It was difficult to appreciate the open space and peacefulness offered by this city park.We walked around the entire park, which took just over an hour. We saw water fountains at the main entrance and also opposite the Vondelpark 3 restaurant. We also saw a couple of hot-dog / ice-cream kiosks. There are public toilets (Dixi portaloo style urinal and cubicle) here and there.Bike hire is available nearby (A-Bike Vondelpark) but not within the park itself.We will visit the park again but not at 6pm on a sunny day!"

A lot people on red/green/blue/hotel bikes who cannot ride a bike or never have done so in their lives. Watch for the fear in their eyes when they try not to cycle in one of the ponds. The second part of the park (at the Amstelveenseweg side) is more laid back and host more locals. Strangely, most of the tourists don't venture here. I think there is an invisible barrier of some sort. Or no mention of it in Lonely Planet ;-)The Vondelpark Open Air Theatre does great shows in the summer season. Check out their calendar. And last but not least: free parking on Sunday's. Not in the park of course, but on the roads adjacent to it."

We were intrigued by the small bridge with the padlocks attached to the fencing. Lovers have put their initials on padlocks and attached them to this bridge. We had lunch at the cafe in the park, which is beside the lake. This was a lovely location from which to watch the walkers and cyclists. It was very relaxing. This is a good place to unwind and destress."

Many sculptures, flowers, monuments and playgrounds for the little ones. The bicycles like in all of Amsterdam are truly amazing. There are many clean outhouses if you need facilities. Many places to see. Since it is around 25 acres with many paths I suggest you buy a map for 1 euro at the information building. We felt very safe walking and taking pictures there, just like we felt in all of Amsterdam."

It is fun to go for a ride through Vondelpark, though, and it is iconic Amsterdam, so no matter what I say, you're gonna go!

Some special places for children (e.g. ladders and rope bridges), including a swimming pool for little children (water depth around 30 centimeters it seems). Dogs playing around. Very very nice and relaxing."

Personally I would not make a special effort just to see the park. It is pleasant and worth a visit if you have time to fill in. It is just a park we found, nice coffee shop there and nice food."

We met our guide Michael and the rest of the group. There were probably 20 of us from all over the world.Michael was a fountain of knowledge, and kept us all entertained with his stories, information and jokes. The tour went for 3 hours with a 15 minute break at a local cafe where you could purchase drinks but certainly weren't pressured to. We went to lots of little places that we probably wouldn't have otherwise seen. This included a quick detour into the red light district. I had my 15 year old daughter with me so certainly wouldn't have ventured there otherwise but it was really interesting to have a quick look, and there wasn't anything too risque for her to see. He also covered the marijuana cafes and how they came about which was also really interesting.Take an umbrella or rain jacket with you as the tour will still go ahead.These tours are run by freelance guides so whilst they are technically free, the guides rely on your donations for their living. You are asked to donate whatever you feel the tour is worth. It really was a fantastic experience and well worth a generous donation. My 15 year old daughter also really enjoyed it, but if you are concerned about your kids hearing reference to drugs, the sex industry and a bit of starting then this might not be suitable for you.Thanks Michael for a great tour!"

It is really difficult to catch a good weather in Amsterdam, but if you're lucky and you have a day off, or at least an evening before the sunset on a sunny day- Vondelpark is the best place to spend your time. All parks in Amsterdam are amazing but Vondelpark is the largest of all. In June you will enjoy the most delicious Linden scent and see the stork nest. Swan- families, ducks with ducklings and lots of other birds are so close that you can take a selfie with them. There is a place for every taste: BBQ -lovers, romantics and joggers. "

It has three cafes; Filmuseum at the top, Blauwe Theehuis in the middel, and the Vondeltuin at the bottom. The Vondeltuin also has a very nice play yard for kids with a big slide. There are three other attractions for kids in the Park; Melkhuisje (Play yard); Tree houses and the Pierenbad (for sunny days). Check your kids for Ticks if your are done."

Take your time and enjoy. This is what the natives do.There are cafe's, bathrooms and water parks all over as well. The food is pretty standard, but completely palatable and not too expensive. All of Amsterdam is a bit expensive so it is not really out of line.

We grabbed a place beneath huge tree and spent a good time with music in the background (concert)."

Late afternoon - people barbecuing, having a birthday party on the green, simply relaxing. Caught the end of wonderful jazz concert on the outdoor stage in the center of the park...got to enjoy a Heinken from the kiosk while listening! There are different \"feels\" while walking through this park...there are restaurants right in the middle of the park which gives one a distinctly European feel and then there are \"row homes\" (from the surrounding neighborhoods) that look out onto the park that gives one a New England/Boston feel. Take a walk and enjoy a special place in Amsterdam - Vondelpark"

With all of the recent rains throughout the region many of the gravel paths in Voldelpark were too wet to run on but the hard surfaces were just fine. As others have pointed out - be very mindful of the omnipresent bicycles. They are EVERYWHERE! And, they all seem to think they have an eternal right of way. Despite this minor aggravation, this is a great place to run in the midst of a great big city. Highly recommended."

If you wake up feeling nauseous or with an overwhelming hangover my advice is to cut back on partying and take a great breakfast followed by this majestic park. The Vondelpark is amazingly beautiful, and it gives you a notion of the quality of life people experience while living in Amsterdam. You can take the opportunity to enjoy nature while exercising and take some beautiful photos."

            "review": "A TREASURED OPEN SPACE. It is a long walk from Amsterdam's busy streets, like spokes from the wheel hub of Dam Square, to find quiet countryside. City parks are few. The Vondelpark is close to the Van Gogh and Riks museums. It is a place to seek a place to contemplate on what one has gleaned from looking at so many paintings that one can be overwhelmed.Behind its finely wrought iron gates the park is narrow in its width. Fine brick-built houses dating back to the early 1800's can still be seen through summer trees. High roomed windows give a clear view of graceful young women, wired for sound, gliding along black asphalted paths on roller-skates. Traffic noise attenuated is replaced by shouting, screaming children letting off steam, whilst young city-mums seek to get their skins sun-kissed from spread-out blankets and watch there children of so many different ethnic hues play on the green and russet skins of grass. Whilst other children are content to be told about the different breeds of water birds bobbing up and down on the small central lake.It is a park where on the Kings birthday hundreds of children sit alongside the walking paths to sell all the unwanted bric-a-brac, and with there national ability know how to strike a bargain and make a good profit.It is also the park on this same KINGS DAY when the Dutch Royal House goes walk-about that the air of the park is filled with cannabis smoke and to become lit-up with taking in this mixture along with the aromatic ingredient of Happy Cake. I thought I would try to inhale to seek a path to perception. It was all part of the experience. In winter time the windows of the overlooking houses are closed. Curtains drawn, but in this park the warmer coated skaters arrive and if it has snowed then with all the twinkling lights one can enjoy moments of magic."

We had a perfectly sunny day and we so enjoyed watching the locals riding their bikes, meeting up with friends and children enjoying being outside. We enjoyed a lovely light beer while sitting outside a little tea-room that served other drinks and light meals, as well. This is a wonderful spot, full of greenery and fountains not far from the city centre.There are clean public toilets for which we had to pay a small fee. However, there was no entrance fee - so well worth the trip. Lovely escape from the busy city."

And there is not much to see or do there. We had planned to rent bikes, but there are no bike rentals in the park and the ones nearby closed at 5pm (in April), so that was a no go. But it's just as well that did not work out, because in a short time, we had walked through more than half the park on foot and were nonplussed and ready to go. It's a pleasant park, but it's not a destination."

The second time was better in mid-week, with fewer people. On both occasions the better end of the park is at the south-west (the end further away from the centre of Amsterdam), where you can find some tranquil spots. But the park is rather narrow, so it's hard to think yourself far away from the city bustle. Bicycles are ubiquitous in the park, so it is not a refuge from them either. Not one of the world's great parks, but not a bad place for a stroll either."

On sunny days the closely cropped grass is inviting and many people bring rugs and settle down with a book to read or just for a snooze in the sun.Invigorating because of the flow of cyclists, joggers and roller skaters along the paved, motor-free, routes through and around the park. Each person either intent on the daily dose of fitness exercise or simply taking advantage of the traffic-free route from one part of the city to another.If, like me, you are frugal and have your own packed-lunch to munch, then I found the stay long enough to see almost every type and size of bicycle that there is.

As I walked through, I spotted a wading pool for kids, free of charge. While I do not have children, I imagine this to be class for kids in the summer. The Vondelpark has cafes/restuarants (in the middle and one at the exit, as far as I know), which looked busy. The park was clean and is so close to the city centre that it's ideal for anyone visiting Amsterdam, and wanting to escape the busy shopping/restaurant streets around the Grachten. Also, ideal for runners."

We could see from the scorch marks that locals probably light a barbecue or have picnics in the park and it was great to see the local yoga classes being held there.

Parakeets are common as are herons which have protected nest areas.

If you are into Edm festivals or any type of festivals this is the place to go. There is always an event going on. Ask a local. Everyone was so nice and helpful.I am definitely going to return!"

There are lagoons and foot paths as well as bikeways that extend a warm hand of welcome to anyone who wants to take advantage of a lovely green space in the city. The surrounding neighborhoods are gorgeous and elegant boutique shopping is readily available. Take some time to stroll through this lovely urban park that ranks among the best in the world."

When we were there, there were groups of school children using the park for races and what looked like a dance off (possibly as part of their Koning Day Celebrations), but it was lovely to see the area was so well looked after and used. I could easily spend hours here with a good book on a sunny day, but with so much to see and do, it was just a brief pit stop and calm moment for us!"

Vondelpark is a 47 hectare city park in Amsterdam situated a few minutes walk northwest of Museumplein, providing much needed leisure, recreation and green space for residents and visitors of Amsterdam. This park was opened in 1865 and is named after playwright Joost van den Vondel for whom there is a monument placed at the northeast end of the park. You'll find plenty of grassy areas for picnics, walking and bike paths, crisscrossing Vondelpark as well as a lakes with pavilion (and possible birdlife). Other interesting things to see at Vondelpark include an abstract sculpture of a fish by Picasso as well as a bronze of a Caribbean lady by local sculptor, Nelson Carillho. We visited during March when the trees remain bare of leaves. Luckily we were able to see some early daffodils which were nice. Like most large city parks in Europe, Vondelpark will make for a more pleasant visit during warmer months of the year when the trees are full, flowers in bloom and weather more enjoyable. In the end, Vondelpark is a nice rural retreat in city and offers accessible park space to escape from busy streets of Amsterdam."

Surrounded by residential neighborhood, the periphery of the park are edged by homes and the occasional cafe & restaurant. What my Wife and I noticed is that this park has absolutely no water fountains and no restrooms. I guess this is to discourage vagrants from living in the park or something, but when you've gotta go, you've really gotta go and there is nowhere to go inside the park itself. We had to hike back out of the park in order to find a restroom and that pretty much ended our experience."

In fact in terms of playgrounds and space it is worse.

It's right in the middle of the city, so you can see buildings all around, but it's still somewhat quieter than the streets (inverse square law and that...). The layout allows quite a bit of wandering around, assuming that you can stay out of the way of the pushbikes. The feral pushbike is a peculiarity of Amsterdam and you simply need eyes in the back of your head if you're planning to change your position on the path/grass. We did see quite a few groups using the park as a gym. Shuttle-running, skipping-ropes, 2-person yoga, shadow boxing and suchlike, and mostly done following itinerant trainers who arrive on pushbikes with their kit in a small trailer behind the bike. On a cold April morning, this was a surprise and I suspect that in the summer this is far more widespread. An interesting glimpse into local lives. We did't try any of the various hostelries/teashops around the park but it's a city park and well-maintained. Probably much better in the warm sunshine later in the year."

The only let down was the amount of dog poo that hadn't been picked up so just make sure you watch where you walk.

Having gone thru half the park and not having found one single playground for children to play in, we just left. Maybe they are all gathered in the other half we didn't see. Also the fact that the bikes cross the park at the speed of light using the same paths as people that are walking, makes it dangerous for children to be let loose so in the end, it is just not for them.

It\u2019s all very democratic, just like Amsterdam. The English-style layout offers an abundance of ponds, lawns, thickets and winding footpaths that encourage visitors to get out and explore the scene. Vondelpark is home to a selection of restaurants and caf\u00e9s, including the Blauwe Theehuis (my favourite one) , Caf\u00e9 Vertigo, Vondelpark3, De Vondeltuin and the Groot Melkhuis. You\u2019ll also find a skate rental shop, an open-air theatre and a rose garden with more than 70 types of roses in the park. The Main Entry is near the Leidsenplein.

The park is not too big to where you can walk the whole park and not feel lost like Central Park or Hyde Park, but big enough to where you feel like you can find your own little spot of tranquility.There are multiple restaurants/cafes in the park where you can stop and get food or a coffee. There are playgrounds for kids and also a rose garden. There are lots of people working out in groups and running. There are also a couple of dog fields where all of the dog owners head to and let their dogs off leash to run and play. There may be one dog or 20 dogs at one time.Many people ride their bikes through the park. If you are a tourist remember to look both ways before crossing in case a bike is coming your way. You can also rent bikes to cycle through the park which is fun. Just remember to follow the rules and stay on the right side when riding.Overall, a visit to Vondelpark is a must if you're visiting Amsterdam."

I got to walk around the city for a whole day and although I was very tired at the end of it I would not change a thing! The city is magical, the old buildings and the style of the city, the people was so warm and the canals are so beautiful. The one thing that caught my attention the most, was vondelpark. I got there and started walking and walking and it seems like it's never going to end, it's so big! What was so amusing about it was the fact that it is full of animals, little lakes, spaces for children and even a place for found objects! (If you find something, anything, that doesn't belong to you, you just leave it there for the owner to look for it) isn't it incredible? It's a beautiful place to go with friends, family or that special someone."

I was happily proven wrong, the park is a wonderful place to spend time. We visited twice, once early afternoon and then again later in the evening. In the afternoon the park was filled with families and people on bikes, skates and dozing in the sun (we had beautiful weather when we visited in september) and in the evening it was much the same. Lots of exercise classes and people sitting on the grass.The park itself is beautiful, extremely clean and well kept and there are lots of birds and wildlife to see. We had heard some rumours not to go down at night but it's one of those things, I wouldn't go to Central Park at night either. Whether it becomes a sinister place or not we never saw even the hint of it being a \"bad\" place to go. It was peaceful, clean and quiet. Perfect when you want to take a break from the hustle and bustle for a little while."

When planning a trip to another country or city I make much use of other peopl's reviews.

After about 50 minutes, the first thing we noticed was blue became really intense and stood out from every other colour. Then the sky became the most amazing blue, and started changing between blues and violets.Then they kicked in harder and peoples faces started to change, so we found a bench to sit on in the sun away from people. We stayed on the bench for around 2-3 hours talking crap seeing the floor melt and not wanted to stand up, with giggles none stop, laughing till we were crying. The park was the perfect place to take these and it was an unreal experience! To top it all off, on the way out, parrots were flying around everywhere! WHAT?!We thought it was the mushrooms, but we took pictures of them and checked later, and there are actual parrots in the park! Everywhere!! Such a good park!"

It's a pleasant lunchtime walk with several different routes although it's limited width means that you are always almost within sight of the eastern or Western boundary. There are lakes and a few interesting buildings and sculptures but it's main attraction is as a fairly peaceful (but busy) walk. And you still need to be careful to avoid being run over by the city's mad cyclists"

So, more than the rating it's important to know how to get the best out of it. Best hours are at dawn or before 10am, so you can appreciate the northern light, absolutely special. Vondelpark is the epicenter for runners, bikers and for people playing every kid of outdoor sports (yoga included). Pay lot of attention to the bikes: locals are fast and they assume tourist know the rules, which is not always the case unfortunately. If you're biking stay on the right, use the bell, and pay extra attention to the others. If walking stay outside the paved roads: those are for bikers and runners. Green areas can be accessed without restrictions. It's a safe place also in the evening, while you may prefer to avoid late night hours. You never know."

In the 70-ies it was a place where hippies slept overnight, but that is no longer allowed. It is well kept and enjoyable, just watch out for the cyclists that use it as a short-cut from the center to Old-West. And also for runners, who do their daily practice after office hours. It is a 5 minutes walk from the Museum-Square/Plein, don't miss it!"

I have lived in Amsterdam for 1,5 years now and the Vondelpark is a place I have visited often, passing through it on my way to work, enjoying summer events such as the free open concerts (!!) and studying with friends. It is a vibrant place, in the early morning scattered joggers and late clubbers can be found, while from the afternoon onwards all sorts of folk can be found. In the summer it can be crazy busy with tourists, barbecueers and the like, so beware. Also, check out the vondelbunker under the bridge, where all sorts if events, concerts and exhibitions can be organized. The only thing that bothers me has more to do with the people than the park in itself, namely, the mess that is left. I would pass through the park every Saturday around 7 Am and the place would be completely trashed, municipality workers cleaning up the stuff lousy tourists and lazy party-goers left behind. So please, if you visit the park take responsibility and throw away your trash or take it with you!"

It was a little muddy while we were there because it had just rained a lot, but I'd imagine in the summer and fall, I would be spending lots of time here. There's a few ponds with some wildlife and I even saw little green parrot-looking birds flying around. It's quiet aside from the fact that jet airplanes fly low over the park every 10 minutes or so, which is a treat in itself if you like airplane spotting. With a standard pair of binoculars or decent camera zoom, you can see in the windows of the planes. I don't recommend looking in windows of houses, cause that's just rude, lol.

I was surprised to find such a lovely park in a city as I had not visited the Amsterdam before so did not expect to find much in the way of nature and trees. We were fortunate to have a sunny day in November. I would recommend sensible walking shoes as some of the park can be quite muddy. There is a little cafe you can stop in, and there are benches you can sit and enjoy the weather. Lots of people walk their dogs there so you'll see so many well natured pets playing with other dogs and walking next to their owners happily without a leash. Lots of people ride their bikes so be mindful that even in the parks bikes are always around you. Very relaxed atmosphere, peaceful little place if you fancy wandering off from the city streets. You can probably circle the whole park in about an hour."

We saw that it was the #4 rated attraction for Amsterdam on Tripadvisor, but we felt it did not live up to this rating. It was simply average or maybe even below average. But I feel the need to say that we went during November and this was likely why we only felt it was \"average\".The park itself was poorly maintained and their were large puddles of water blocking the paths from recent rain. This meant that we had to walk around the path and into muddy areas of grass. We did throughly enjoy people-watching from a park bench. There must be an elderly retirement facility nearby because their were many cute elderly people walking in the park with their walkers and getting pushed in wheelchairs. We fondly remember one lady in particular that had the cutest little dog happily follow her as she walked with her cane. Another thing we noticed was that none of the dogs of the locals were on leashes, but they were so well-behaved and loyally followed their owners and didn't bother any other people or dogs."

On a summer night you have to litteraly search for a place to sit. The whole park is full of people comming from work and eating there with friends, celebrating there birthday or drinking there before going out. It is the most fun park to be!! Just walking through the park already gives you a good idea of how people from Amsterdam live. Just sit there between the people and watch them for a while...youw will see then why we love this park so much...Go to the nearest supermarket, buy some bread and butter and some wine and enjoy Amsterdam the way we locals see it!!"

I came into the park from a panhandle near the Rijksmuseum and was planning to do a large loop through the main part of the park and back. The weather forecast said thunderstorms were to arrive later in the day, unfortunately the storms arrived early. I made it to the structures in the center of the park, a little beyond the open air theatre. Then the clouds and heavy rumbling sounds blowing in from the other end of the park convinced me that I wouldn't have time.The trees were mostly leafless, of course, and the plantings in the panhandle looked forlorn with nettles being the predominant plant that I recognized. Deeper in, I saw sections of rhododendrons and hydrangeas that might be nice displays in season. The park is a major thruway for bicycle traffic but even with the threatening weather there were families with strollers and dog walkers, as well as a group of rowdy young bloods singing their love of the red light district and drugs. Harmless but loud and almost on key.The only places to wait out the storm were restaurants and I wasn't really hungry so I shortened my loop and let the wind push me back out of the park. I got a little wet but made it back to watch the worst of the lashing wind and rain out of my hotel room window."

Although it was too early for roses to bloom, we could easily imagine how wonderful it is here when flowers blossom.But what we loved most was Kinderbad \u2013 some kind of round shallow swimming pool or fountain bowl where kids could run, play, jump, splash (although water was quite chilly). Taking swimming suits and towels for our daughter was a good idea. The bowl is knee-deep so it fits for children at any age."

We also walked to the Vondelpark Paviljoen and enjoyed beer, fresh mint tea, and a tasty Dutch appetizer platter in the beer garden while watching cyclists zip by. If you are tired of getting lost in the busy city, try getting lost here for a few hours!"

Also - our hotel was on the other side of the Vondelpark, meaning we walked and cycled back through it after midnight. It was perfectly safe and pleasant even at this time. Amsterdam's centre is somewhat lacking in green spaces, so make the most of this beautiful park while you're there."

The difference is that the wide tarmac strtches are for bikes and joggers, pedestrians walk on a gravel path alongside. There is plenty to see in the park, the bird-life ranges from parakeets to herons and there are benches on which to rest. A lovely place to stroll and relax."

Personally, Westerpark is a much better place to relax, with more open space, a few nice places to enjoy lunch or a drink. The bike paths are more interesting, and the vibe is much more relaxed and family / kid friendly, compared to Vondelpark. If you are a tourist, and it's possible to make your way there, you can walk along Haarlemmerdijk (from direction Grand Central, area Jordaan), and see the many interesting shops along your way. I've seen some strange / creepy characters around Vondelpark ....."

During both of our visits, we spent time sitting on park benches, just taking a rest from our busy tourist activities, in a relatively tranquil and attractive environment.It was good to be away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city streets. However there was a continuous flow through the park of cyclists, who are so abundant and common in this city.There are several large lakes located within the park and they are homes to a large variety of bird life. The lakes are a positive addition to the ambience of the park.The weather was hot on each day of our visits to the park and there were plenty of large trees to provide shade from the heat of the sun. Near the main entrance at one end of the park, we found a water tap which provided the public with cold, refreshing drinking water.If you happen to be visiting Amsterdam and you feel the need to escape from the frenzied activities of the central city then you could, as we did, head to the Vondelpark for some time out, to rest and recharge your batteries."

Walkers have their own paths to the side so are safe from the bike traffic. My guidebook said that open air sex was permitted provided it was hidden away in thye undergrowth.

And it's free. I think it's safe, too but Dear Paul Ren\u00e9I am writing to you regarding Louise Daly. I have known Louise personally for over 3 years, and have always known her to be an organized, responsible, and easy going individual. I believe that her skills and experience make her an excellent candidate for a councillor, which is what she would like to progress her career as. I trust that Louise would be very good at such role as she is very helpful, understanding and inspiring. She can always look at a problem from different angles and suggest what can be done about it or how to approach it. Louise is also absolutely trustworthy and as she is a good listener I never hesitate to confide in her as I know that she will be discreet about what I say.When I met Louise, she had just left a busy position of customer service consultant in a call centre, where she was responsible for answering phones and responding to customers complaints and also finding best solutions for them. Being a people person that she is it was a job that Louise was very successful at and always received excellent feedback from her customers. We later worked together when Louise became an Client Services Manager and she continued thriving in this role. She is very organised and as a great Client Services Manager she understands clients and shows empathy and always receives excellent happiness scores from them.During the time I have known her, Louise has been active in local community, being involved in RMDS. Her contributions included organizing and acting in multiple shows that I always enjoyed seeing. Louise has also performed for charity events. Louise is always very supportive to me and her other friends. She is very sociable and has lots of friends that she always finds time for. She supports everyone in their hobbies and passions and while doing that finds herself in different social situation where she always feels comfortable and is ready to make new acquaintances. It was a pleasure and fun to meet Louise\u2019s family and friends on a few occasions; when she celebrated her birthday and also when she invited me to spend Christmas with her family. They are absolutely lovely and immediately made haven't had a chance or need to visit at night"

The park contains so much natural beauty, there's so much to marvel at & lots of places to sit down to take it all in.We had our first magic truffles experience which was crazy but Vondel was the perfect location, we felt so in touch with our surroundings, it was a journey through our minds as we watched the water & listened to the chirping birds. The park was very neat with hardly any litter, but the porta-potties really let it down, they were DIRE. The smell was gut wrenching, we called it quits & used the on site restaurants toilet for a 50 cent charge which was totally worth it. We went back to the park the next day, this time on hired bikes & completely sober. It was breathtaking. Thank you for such a great experience Vondel, you're a gem x"

This park offcourse is best at spring and now in Autum when there is a change in colours so cool and I mean Cool its quite cold now but bring a jacket and shawl and your fine, its worth the visit......"

It was around 4pm, and there were quite a few people around, which is to be expected in Amsterdam. For some reason the walking paths are made of packed dirt, so when it rains they turn to mud. In Amsterdam, it's constantly \"sweating\" so the trails were muddy in many places. There was trash in every nook and cranny, as well as teenagers and tourists in groups of 3 or 4 in the bushes smoking weed and/or drinking. I don't have a problem with either activity, but they also were blasting music and throwing beer cans on the ground. Very few flowers surprisingly. There were some herons, which were interesting. Overall, go if you want to see it, but I don't think it's essential viewing for an experience in Amsterdam."

That is fine with me but it makes the park very, very busy on summer days.

It was developed in 1865 and is named after the most famous Dutch poet, writer and playwright. The Pavilion was built in 1878 while the Blue Tearoom opened in 1937. The rose garden in the center was created in 1936.Other facilities include a children's playground, an open-air theatre, a Film museum as well as four bar/restaurants.The place is very popular with 10 million visitors a year. It's also a favorite for kids on roller blades, joggers and cyclists which can be a nuisance at times. Having said this, it's still a great place to take a break, meet people and for having a picnic or BBQ."

There are a few cafes and restaurants in the park, the food is expensive for what it is but it's fine for a cold beer.

My friends were raving about it in the run up to our trip and our visit there was alright, but it's just a park. I'm not sure how it is the 5th top thing to do in Amsterdam. It has grass and path ways and ponds, but with so much else to do in Amsterdam I wouldn't waste time going again if i were only going for a weekend. I'm sure it would be lovely if you were local, I'm just not sure it's worth wasting vacation time on. Also the bike problem that is everywhere in Amsterdam is tenfold inside the park, you are risking your life with every step."

Climbing frame, swings, basket, dens, slide and then the best bit....a kind of fountain splash pool. My daughter aged 6 went a bit crazy, stripped down to her knickers and splashed around with around 5 or 6 other girls and had a whale of a time. I didn't know it was there and had no spare clothes or towel so thankfully it was a warm day. The water is very shallow so there were lots of toddlers in. It was just very special and you wouldn't see that for us at home.We also had gorgeous sandwiches and drink and apple cake at the cafe- highly recommended! And free toilets too (find the staffed ones, avoid the yellow cubicles if you can, they are revolting!). Great place, loooove it, even if virtually everyone is cycling very fast!"

So, take your time and explore the lakes and gardens within, or do as we did and cycle on down to nearby Rembrandtpark, too.Well worth a visit, and a great place to cycle for those who are a bit timid on Amsterdam's roads."

If you're unlucky, you might see a weirdo do a number 2 between the plants. PS did you know a band called Vondelpark because they liked the place that much?"

The city is in a constant state of motion with trains, trams, buses, cars, boats, pedestrians and the never-ending sea of bicycles. Vondelpark is a true reprieve from the city. It's oddly calming and quiet in the park even though there is a strong volume of people using the grounds to exercise, to walk their dogs, etc. The park is extremely well kept and there are several picture worthy spots along the main walkways. I just wish we had had more time to stop and have lunch. It's quite the magical spot."

We went in a day where is wasn't to hot which was nice because we could appreciate it more. Its just outside the centre and walking distance from the Heineken experience which is a must, the tram is just outside and takes you straight to the centre"

Many people simply come and go and many return again and again. Some of them are park fixtures, people who were there ten years ago. If you spend any number of days in Amsterdam without stopping here you miss so much of what makes this city a balanced one. Vondel park gives a slice of nature necessary for that complete spirit we often strive for."

I have visited when it has been virtually deserted and also on the Queen's (now the King's) birthday. If you have a chance..do both. The King's birthday transforms the park into a carnival atmosphere. A very interesting contrast to a quite day in low tourist season."

Band playing the first day and second got a drink and sat on the grass verge and actually recharged energy. Only thing I would advise is don't sit on your own if a female as partner went to get drinks and I had 2 men approach me who were quite intoxicated. Was a little scary but remained polite and got up and walked away from them. There are police patrolling so wasn't too worried."

As a cyclist (in Amsterdam that's most people) it's a fantastic place to head for an early leisure ride before it gets too full. It's said that most cyclists are using the park as part of their route from A to B, but a lap around it and back home gives me 8km of exercise and for that purpose it is fantastic. The road around the park is wide, with footpaths either side. When it gets busy the tourists tend to walk all over the road which makes cycling interesting, but there's a lot more space here than in the canal district and centre so it's easier to avoid them without resorting to angry bell ringing.Otherwise the park has some water, a few narrow footpaths through bushes and trees, and some nice places for food and drink. There is an ope air theatre for fun in the summer. At weekends it is incredibly busy, which can ruin its purpose as a getaway from the noise of the city, but given its location by Leidseplein and associated tram routes it is easy to get to and enjoy the scenery."

It has several separate sections aimed at different activities. As an Amsterdam native I prefer the jogging trail around the perimeter of the park that is about 2.5 km long. To relax I prefer the other parks in the city. The reason being the overabundance of litter and dog droppings that make it impossible to sit in the grass anywhere. During the summer many people (natives and tourists) frequent the park for BBQ or other activities. Many leave their litter, which is removed by volunteers (who cannot manage the entire park) in the morning.To just get away from the city, the park is fine, but for true relaxation I would recommend some of the other parks that are less touristic and are cleaned more properly."

Vondelpark is a perfect place to spend a day in, wandering around the lakes and rivers, or through the rose gardens and across picturesque bridges.

Paths lead right from the busy centre of town and stretch for a mile or so, down to the more residential area of Amsterdam. There are many areas to enjoy a picnic, and even a barbeque, as there are areas specifically designed for them. There is a fantastic jungle gym hidden in a copse of trees which children (and adults) will love, and a children's play area which has an outdoor paddling pool. The park is very clean and tidy and though very busy (hugely popular as a cycling route) it still remains a haven of peace and quiet. There are a great many wild parakeets flying around, as well as jays, herons, geese and many other birds, and you can find yourself lost in your own little world as you meander around its paths. The entrance to Vondelpark is very close to many tram and bus stops and it also has many many entrances that come out on different side streets, and make for a delightful day/days out as you discover new places to eat, drink and shop!"

Its great that the bustling city of amsterdam has a green area like this where you can nap, ride your bike, walk, dance, jog, and eat!My boyfriend and I had rented bikes to go to the heineken museum and bols museum.. We then decided while we were in the area we'd ride to Vondel Park. I hadnt really researched this park before we went so didn't really know what to expect. It was busy; bikes, pushchairs, people everywhere.. But the park is the biggest park i have ever seen and was very well thought about. There is water, birds, bandstands and patches of grass to relax on. There was also music playing on a stage when we got there but we decided a sit on the grass would do us good instead. Its amazing how a place like that can make you feel somewhere else.A must see for a chilled out time in the park!"

Classical, jazz, pop... there's always something worth seeing.

You can also bring alcohol and weed if that's your thing as it's all allowed (the Netherlands is great)."

I recommend that you take a picnic with you and find somewhere to just sit and relax once you have had a wander around the park. It is very big and lovely and clean!! If you have children there is a play area that is fenced off so you can set yourself up in there and let the children play in the large pool area, the water seemed very clean like it had been treated, our 10 month played in there without any problems!Definitely recommend a lazy afternoon in here away from the chaos of Amsterdam!!"

Sure it's more open than most capitals with all the canals and relatively low structures, but it's still a city.Vondelpark is that spot of nature we were looking for. Situated close to the city center, the Park is wide and open with large pathways, lakes, small forest-y areas.You can have a picnic or a walk with your partner or a laugh with your mates while enjoying a spliff. Usual things you can do in a park.Some nice restaurants and bars as well, so you can grab a bite and a drink if you get the munchies."

I'm a big fan of Amsterdam's habit of putting fitnesstoestellen (fitness parks, or \"adult playgrounds\", if you will) in their parks so people can work out for free on the metal they set up there. There's plenty of space to bike or walk here, as usual per parks in the Netherlands, and there are quite a few restaurants and things to do around this area.

Very easy walking and stroller and bike (of course, it is in Amsterdam after all) friendly. We highly recommend this park especially if you have children!!"

We loved how it was divided up into lots of little park areas, but no overall map made it difficult to find things with small kids along. Finally found crazy tall slides that are shown in many pictures of the park. Slides are more for older kids, 4-5 is minimum, 8-9 better. But that is it for that area. Our kids were pretty disappointed with park's offerings. After Luxembourgh Gardens in Paris this expectations for playgrounds have increased, and this was a little disappointing.The stick / wood playground was cool, creative, and they liked that, but still a little disappointed by playground equipment."

Its also a great through road by foot or bike to get to other parts of the city.There is lots to see, including a pond, ducks, birds, and generally some street performers. There is also a restaurant/bar and food takeaway places. When I visited there were some people practicing rollerblading and the generated a big crowd watching them."

It has some great climbing equipment, but a bit too big for my child. There was a big sandpit though that was great fun. Next, we went to the treetop paths. While my little one was a bit slow in the paths, she found it great fun and went through 5 or 6 times. Finally, we went to the playground with a little shallow pool alongside smaller playground equipment (slide, swings, see-saw, climbing frame) and spent a couple of hours there splashing and playing. Such a great place!"

Although it is certainly not on the scale of Central park, I found the park enjoyable for a lunch time stroll."

We didn't make Vondelpark one of our destinations but had old information on Tulip Island which was an exhibit last year. The website should be updated because it is not here this year. Vondelpark is a nice city park with safe walking areas and shade. It looks like they make a point to provide free arts and music as there is a packed schedule of theatre programming. It did bring many people which was nice. Compared to other parks I've been to it could use a decent clean up. I wouldn't suggest it as a destination but a nice respite from your busy walking around Amsterdam if you are in the area. We didn't feel unsafe but note it did seem like there were some people using the park as a place to sleep. You do find this in every large metropolitan city. It shouldn't be a deterrent because it is large enough to have a cool, shaded pleasant walk or bike ride. In fact, it is safer to walk and bike ride here than in the city!.We did like hanging out at Vondelpark3 a restaurant at the entrance. Here you will find a very healthy mix of guests, great food and atmosphere. Check out my separate review."

Vondelpark is a rough oblong shape with lakes, winding paths, and many shade trees and benches.Locals use it for biking (they bike everywhere!), walking, jogging, and just sitting and picknicking. Free concerts are given during he summer, and it is a great place to people-watch in relative safety (no cars or trolleys, and few speeding cyclists) Depending on your map-reading skills, a stroll through Vondelpark can be a pleasant short-cut to other parts of the city. Like everything else we saw in Amsterdam, it is well and thoughtfully maintained."

The park is not that big (actually, it is ideal for running, one round is 3,3 km), but it is the center of the Amsterdam outdoor life. If it's not raining, that's to say. You simply go there, take some coffee, beer, wine and joint with you, sit down and watch people pass by. Walking, running, cycling, skating, dancing, tai chi-ing, etc. Have fun!"

There are other park environments closer to the central museums, but they are often busy--particularly in the late afternoon. So, if you get tired of the masses of humanity, go here for a quiet walk. We were only here in the daytime; so, we don't know about the safety later in the evening."

There was quite a bit of garbage laying around and the grass looked like it had see a lot of traffic.

So many of the locals and tourists just sit about and enjoy the surroundings of this interesting park with lots of water features/ponds, paths, trees and grass. There are designated picnic areas where the smell of smoke barbeques was unmissable. And several people were also partaking in recreational drugs. On our second visited it was on hired bicycles and we felt quite safe cycling round. You don't feel intimidated to go at a speed you are not happy with. And we got to see the whole park. I would certainly go back on another visit as the way that the paths, lakes and trees are laid out makes it interesting. There is also somewhere to eat, and an open air theatre."

If you happen to ride your bike or stroll through this green oasis of Amsterdam on a rare sunny winter day, you will be rewarded with a beautiful mix of unpretentious nineteenth century garden design and inviting paths that bend through ponds and gardens and open greens. But all too often, the park becomes blighted by visitors who don't respect what a beautiful gift they have in their city, whether local citizens or visitors from a far. Be prepared for litter, beer bottles and a less peaceful atmosphere that a great city park should offer which is such a shame. For a better experience, head to the Westerpark where you'll find a good atmosphere, pleasant surroundings and cleverly restored gas refinery turned to entertainment venues and restaurants to quench your senses and palate."

It has lakes, benches, people lying on the grass, alcoholics with their bottles in brown bags, all the things that ANY park in the world has, nothing special. However, having said that, it does have one of the I amsterdam signs in the park, whilst this sign isnt as busy as the one in Museumplein, it still has people cosntantly on it (I waited over 40 mins trying to get a picture of the sign without people climbing on it, humping it, standing in front of it, taking millions of selfies, etc and then lost patience and gave up on my picture). In my mind this park doesnt represent Amsterdam because to me Amsterdam is canals. However if youre looking to get away from the canals and spend some time in a park, then I expect youll enjoy this park far more than I do."

We went to the Vondelpark on 21st May 2015 on a lovely Spring day it was beautiful but it is a large park so I suggest you hire a bike unless you want to be there all day.Not even flowers to get 5 stars but a lovely park if you want peace and quiet."

The whole place was full of young people lying around in the sun smoking ??? . We visited on a Thursday so one could assume that many of those lying around were unemployed. No wonder our hotel was full of other young people from outside Holland who had found it easy to get jobs. Vondelpark seemed to be a meeting place for rappers playing very loud music, or am I just an old fart?"

Cheese, wines, pates, breads, hams or whatever you need. Come early, because the park will be crowded soon, if the weather is sunny. Find a place near one of the many ponds. They are full of different kind of birds around. Last time when we were there, in front of us came a Common Crane, which kept company to us for couple of hours. Well, the wine was fine and all the eatables were tasty. Another great day in Amsterdam."

Mac bike rentals which is a few blocks from the park told us to follow a path and we'll see the park. Lo and behold from the path we saw the park.The park is very big and the pathways are very wide. The pathways are wide enough to share between joggers, bikers and those leisurely strolling about. No cars are allowed in the park. There are benches scattered around the park where you can sit and ponder the meaning of life if thats your thing. I loved that we could bike safely inside without any cars to worry about. To our surprise there were even ducks in the lagoon inside the park. Tips in exploring:We biked through the park and i think this is the best way to explore it as it is too big to walk around in. Make sure you remember where you entered as you can easily get lost in the park and forget where to exit. If you are with a group make sure you have phones as you are liable to lose each other inside the park. Keep small kids close to you as dogs of all sizes run unleashed. Bring some cash so you can buy snacks from the food carts inside the park. Better still go to the park armed with some cheese, sandwiches and drink and have an impromptu picnic. 2 to 5 hours is more than enough to explore the park.If you are suffer from touristy site and museum overload, this is a good place to decompress and relax."

Vondelpark is a very lovely city centre park, a bit wilder and much less manicured than, say, Hyde Park or Green Park in London, therefore, to modern tastes, much more attractive. In springtime it is full of nesting birds and ducks leading their ducklings to the water. But on King's Day, every path is crowded by the sales pitches of the children of Amsterdam (with some of their parents) attired in orange (the colour of the royal house) attempting to sell their unwanted toys, games and clothes. Many of them are most creative and entertaining in their efforts, featuring musical instruments, acrobatics, competitions, and goodness knows what else. It seemed to us that while they were all there selling, in their hundreds of thousands, nobody had come to buy. Still, they were all having a gret time. If you go, remember to wear something orange, or you'll look out of place."

The romantic design hides the fact that it is in fact a very thin stretch of meadow/parkland a few hundred meters wide running 2 kilometers westwards from the old city perimeter to the west. Take care when you plan to go there as in the rush hour local bikers drive a deadly course from East to West or vice versa. On a sunny day families find a place near one of the playgrounds. There is even a shallow swimming basin for the kids! Great to escape the bustle of the town.This Monday of course it was busy all kinds music, games, acts and children's flea market during the King's Birthday. Great time despite the morning chill"

Still remember the ice skating we use to do in wintertime, climbing the chestnuttrees especially in autumn, building an organic hideaway from pure natural material when I was about 7 years old. At the age of 9 I made my first and only \"tomahawk\" and after trying it out I was delighted that it stuck in the tree I aimed at. Even tried out a boomerang of natural material, even though my skills were very basic. Later I enjoyed the free concerts in summertime (June to August), one in particular (Steel Pulse) was so well visited I decided to run home to see it on television. I just could not get close enough, so busy it was that day. Queensdays it used to be one of the best places to go to, not just for chilren, for grownups as well! Music, theatre, freemarket, open-air chess and many familiar faces ... There is a very nice terrace in the middle, called \"Het blauwe theehuis\" an at the end, just before de Amstelveense weg, you can enjoy pancakes and \"poffertjes\" in a nice garden, there are several playgrounds for children an even for gay people there is a famous place to meet, the \"rose garden\". You name it, the Vondelpark has it! One of the best places to hang out, any time of year and especially with good wheather. In one word: unforgetable."

The grassy area between the lakes which is gated so that people and dogs cannot access it, is full of rabbits running round freely. The two cafes seemed lively and welcoming. Just be very aware of cyclists as in Amsterdam in general, as they are everywhere and tend to fly through the main gates in both directions at once. There are lovely views of the residential areas that surround the park. It was very cold and wintry when we went, but I expect it's even nicer when the leaves and flowers come out."

Well, my first impressions where really not the same as in New York besides of the size which is bigger than a usual park in Europe (in my opinion). I can tell that it is a really nice walk passing by mostly bicycles (which is nice). I was there in March 2015 which could be the reason that the park was not overpopulated which made it a lovely place to take a walk. I would recommend it definitely."

All events we encountered were free :) and the park is well maintained and included is plastic picnic blankets (if you can find the folding boards). Tip: great for riding bikes in (rent a bike from a off the beaten path bike rental store for better prices, local bikes (not the ads on wheel) and good friends). We rented from AJAX bikes. Tip: in the summer they host an array of free music and in the park movies!"

Found this park on our first day arriving in Amsterdam was only a 10 min walk from our hotel (Iron Horse), was fantastic every Friday they have live music to basically as far as I can tell celebrate the start of the weekend! After a walk through the park we saw every walk of life from parents and children to people who had jut left the office (bikes everywhere as per the norm!) People were having bbq's listening to music reading books no one was bothering anyone! There were several works of art displayed through out the park which was interesting and a tulip island (Im not sure of this as we were there at the end of the day but was displaying an unbelievable display of colours available to buy during the day)After a walk through the park we were fortunate enough to stumble across the open air theatre which had the junior version of the royal ballet company practicing. You were able to have a Heineken and enjoy the performance!We left and again stumbled across an early evening performance in the Vondelparkpaviljoen..... This was such a treat sitting out in the sunshine while an amazing orchestra played many well know classical delights (im not cultured enough to know what they were but you would know them if you heard them!) I genuinely say was probably the unexpected highlight of my visit."

One of the park's entrances was right on the street that our hotel was situated on, in the shopping hot spot for those with designer taste, or art lovers, in museumplein. The park is filled with people on bikes (don't worry of being ran over as they have cycle paths!), joggers, tourists, or just people walking through with their dogs. The park has a lake in the centre and is teeming with beautiful birds that look like they've escaped from the zoo! They also have amazingly large houses which are stunning to those who have an eye for architecture. There is also a stage and restaurant but I am unsure of what is properly inside the building. I would recommend going to the park if you like to explore, take photography or just want a scenic walk."

The last time I visited Vondelpark was in the 70s (man) and it was ok cool and groovy back then (maan) but I had avoided it on my last few trip to Amsterdam as I tought it might be a bit dodgy - well how wrong I wasWent there this last time and found that actually it had had a lot of money spent on upgrading it and have to say it is about as good as city centre parks get, lovely gates and entrances, lovely features, and generally lovely but didnt suss out if there were any loos - there might be but I didnt notice them if there were.There a hotel/restaurant by one entrance that looked pretty swish so although we didnt visit it it looked worth a visit next time, another restaurant/caf\u00e9 in the middle and and at warmer times of year theres a stage that loks fairly impressive for outdoor gigs etcOne or two scallwags lurking furtively but mostly and overall vibe very nice, lots of parrakeets flying round, herons and other birds. Don't know what its like at night but daytime a lovely family safe place"

It was just difficult to navigate through it all with all the disrespectful people around.I don't know if it was the time of year, day of the week, whatever, but it was very disappointing for a beautiful park with interesting art to be so polluted with people and their junk.We also biked for a short section of the park on a bike-tour of all Amsterdam, and we did not get the same impression during that.Clean up the litter, and prevent people from being jerks (if possible even), and this would be a fantastic 5-star park."

It is a large green space not far from the museum area and is surrounded by beautiful Victorian and turn of the century mansions. There are a number of small lakes with surprisingly tame birds including herons that you can almost touch. In addition you see many green parrots which are native to India and the Middle East which are descendants of escaped birds who have adapted to this climate. What I went to see in the park was a Tea House built in 1937 in the Art Deco style which is very distinctive and would not look out of place in 1950s America. This park is a nice retreat for a tourist with time on their hands who wants a few moments of pleasurable escape."

This is located near the north entrance of the park, cross the road, over the bridge and through the mini shopping square and you will find it on your right (it is also located near the Kleine Gartmanplantsoen stop). The park enables you to cycle round a couple of times with a couple of variations however don't expect to spend all day discovering new paths.

However, to me it was just a park. There weren't any pretty sights or spectacular flora (not that I was expecting it in the winter), but there wasn't anything that blew my mind or captivated me. Just a bunch of tourists, natives, bicycles, dogs, and dirt paths."

I'm a nature person (don't ask me why I chose to come to Amsterdam in the middle of winter), so finding Vondelpark in the middle of December saved me. I'm staying near Rembrandt Park, which is nice, but I definitely love Vondelpark a whole lot more. It's more busy, but it feels a bit more wild. And there are a few cozy teahouses to pop into when it's raining or you feel like sitting somewhere to write letters to loved ones. Plus there are sooo many cute dogs to watch, and if you're very lucky they might say hi to you."

As others have mentioned, beware of the crazy cyclists, as well as dog crap. As an American dog owner, I was surprised how many people let their dogs free without leashes. It must be heaven for dogs. But the downside was owners who pretended not to see their dogs pooping. I wouldn't go there after dark because of the clumps of men standing around, smoking pot, but not looking very mellow."

Did we find these parrots, well we did spend a lot of time looking up.

There were a handful of dog walkers, another handful of joggers, plenty of cyclists going about there business, a small group playing football and that was about it. The whole place seemed a bit plain. That said it is great to get out of the hustle and bustle of the city and is only a short walk from the Museumplein where there was far more activity going on at the park there. It took us nearly two hours to take a very steady walk round and we did stop in a pleasant cafe for a coffee.

The park does have a reputation for being a breeding ground of cannabis smokers but we thought it was beautiful!There are no bikes to rent in the park, so you will have to find somewhere nearer the city centre to rent them and then ride down."

We went early on a Saturday morning and walked all around the park in the sunshine- gorgeous! We saw lots of birds- herons and parakeets and the atmosphere was really lovely. Lots of people running and doing boot camp type fitness classes out in the open and lots of people just mooching like us. There is a lovely tea house as well in the middle. A lovely place to get away from all the hustle and bustle."

In summer it is a great park to have dinner on the grass. it is a very populair park to run (a round is around 3,6K). Especially on Sundays of early Saturdays. Great to rent a bike and bike trough the park. Very near other facilities like the Rijksmuseum, van Gogh and Stedelijk museum. I just love the park for many occasions and another must see when you are in Amsterdam."

The first visit was a brief ride-through as part of a bike tour and the second was a much longer trip on foot. Vondelpark is a lovely green oasis, fairly close to the center of Amsterdam. There is much to like at the park, but perhaps my favorite aspect was the chance to see native Amsterdamers \"chilling\" and relaxing in their largest park. If your hotel is a long way from Vondelpark, it may not always be worth a visit. But, if you are anywhere in the vicinity, then I recommend Vondelpark as a rewarding place to while away an hour or two."

We enjoyed unexpected sunshine and warmth on our 2nd full day in the city so walked from Jordaan to Vondelpark and all around the beautiful grounds. Lots of lakes, fountains, trees, gardens and birdlife and at least 2 places to relax and people watch over drinks and some food but we strolled back instead to nearby Leidseplein to soak up the sun and atmosphere. The park is well recommended if you've already done all the museums etc."

Shortly after checking in at the nearby Best Western Apollo Museum Hotel we decided to explore the nearby area and came across this beautiful park. Even though it was late afternoon the park was full of people strolling about, jogging or cycling. One thing that surprised us was hearing bird-calls that sounded very like parakeets that we have previously seen in zoos. We were not mistaken when we saw a couple of them flying about between the trees. Our only regret is that we hadn't brought our camera or mobile phones with us, they were being recharged back in our hotel bedroom. Unfortunately with so much to do in Amsterdam, and only two days in which to do it, we were unable to return to the park."

In one pond there is an irregular sequence of fountains of varying height and duration that provides great stimulation.If the park were better maintained, I would rat it more highly. The grass could be a little better tended and there were obvious weeds in several places. Some litter and dog droppings diminshed what would otherwise be a delightful spot.Still well worth a visit and a stroll. You could spend a couple of hours exploring the park."

Simply because if you seen one park, you've seen them all.There is random food and drink vendors throughout the park. I guess I was lucky and didn't run into any homeless drunks and potheads. It was kinda busy during the day but there is plenty of spots to sit and relax. I figured there would have been more park benches. Given the size of the park. One word of caution is about the night time in the park. It can get on the shady side from what some locals told me."

I always feel that the best discoveries are made best by accident, of course I would have seen it on a map but to find it on this slow and quiet Sunday morning was special.The landscape is beautiful, the mature trees and slightly turning colours give it an air of tranquility yet it is full of life. Families, cyclists and runners all combine to make it feel like a vast experiment in human movement where peaceful co-existence is almost made by an arrangement that seems organic. There are numerous pathways and areas to sit and relax or sunbathe if the weather is good, you see remnants of parties gathering in the morning daylight, friends coming together to either end an occasion or to pick up where they left. Even the pooches seem to be entranced, one mama pooch had a head cone on and was toddling calmly on a lead while her pup was scampering about, he came around to the front to check if it was her and then ran around the back and jumped on her shoulders it was hilarious.Lots of trees to sketch and fascinating patterning in the bark and some strange growth patterns, this is a place to fall in love with, to fall in love in and to revisit whenever you can.There are cafes and bars and usually an event or two ongoing, such vitality this city has."

On the other hand, there was just so much going on from families celebrating birthdays, kids learning to ride bikes, people painting, to dogs being trained in a roped off section of the park( this was better than watching a comedy show).This park is well used by locals and tourists alike.

I prefer this park in the morning, because than it is less crowded. It is very popular amongst many people young and old. In Amsterdam many people live on small square meters ( 65 averige ) and have no gardens, so the Vondelpark is used for it. You see people having BBQ, dancing and having personal party' s I like to take a walk around the park and end up having a beer or glass of wine at the terrace of the new restored restaurant Vondelpark 3 what opened in March 2014."

Sadly I found the park quite boring as it's so big and not very scenic. Our parks in England are a lot more picturesque and the wildlife much better. Also more dogs. Also I didn't get run over by a gang of people on bikes. They should offer a separate lane for these people.At weekends they have some bands on where they flog you overpriced beer and offer very little seating. I was pushed around by the rude people here which really put me off. The bands are quite mediocre and not famous, you've never heard of them probably. Also they refuse to speak English so I didn't really understand the schedule so I've had to mark it down. There are some nice pubs and bars in the park which is great however they are way overpriced so I can't really recommend them."

Every park activity that you can imagine was taking place and it seemed so alive. The thing that was a bit off-putting was the number of pot smokers. While they did not seem to congregate where small children were or near people with young families the smell was apparent and as a person that gets sick from the smell it did make me want to move beyond some groups of people quickly. There was music playing in the park and a number or places to get food. Although we missed the tulip season arriving in July there is a part in the park where tulips are planted in such a charming way. People kept showing up to take pictures in this area. Great place to take a picnic."

There is also a free water fountain at the entrance near the Rijksmuseum - perfect for filling water bottles."

This park is everything Amsterdam represents at once. Firstly, Amsterdam is not known for its great weather. If there is a sliver of sun out this park is full to utilize every ounce of the sun. Who knows when you will see it again in Amsterdam. The park has cafes that dot the interior or edges. Some are gardens are some are upscale cafes. Winding paths are good for walks and bikes can be rented. Picnics and friends will be sitting everywhere. If you have the uncommon occurrence of a sunny weekend you may have troubles finding an empty spot.While not the greatest activity by yourself it is truly a good place to be with friends. Still have a look at Dutch culture to see how strong bonds are made with friends by meeting in the park very often as opposed to shopping malls."

We rented bicycles on one day of our holiday, and cycled for about an hour in this park alone - it's huge, beautiful, and there are sculptures all over to attract your gaze. We also noticed there is a BBQ area, that joggers and cyclists flock here to exercise, and the occasional smell of weed suggests a very relaxed atmosphere in general (much like the rest of this amazing city). It is an oasis of calm, not far from the hustle and bustle of life. Now easily one of my favourite spots in the world"

It is not easy to find a place without people around you. If you like sun bathing among the crowd, this is the place. Watching and being watched. But if you like to see the park self, come early in the morning. The best time is in the spring or Autmn, for the flowers or the changing colour of the trees. In the snow, vondel park has totally different view. The park is easy to find, take tram no.1, 2 or 5, stop at Leidseplein and then 5 minutes walk to the main entrance. From June 15 - August 29 there is exhibition \"Art Zuid\" ( artwork) junior scattered all over the park. You can have good food in the restauranst in the park and also a film museum"

Everyone was enjoying a sunny day, dog-walking, jogging, roller-skating, listening to music, people-watching, or they were just lazing about in grass. Free concerts are given at the open-air theatre. Other attractions are the statue of the poet Vondel, the cast iron music dome, the Groot Melkhuis with a playground for children. We bought some hot dogs and drinks and made a picnic out of the day! It was great!"

I think you can get a decent feel for the Dutch community and how active their lifestyle is by visiting this place. Hundreds of people jogging, running, biking, and out playing sports. There are also plenty of benches to people watch or just take in the park itself. Plenty of restaurants inside as well to grab a bite to eat. It is also very walkable in my opinion as I was able to walk all the way from one end to the other in an hour and 1/2 time. I was quite happy to be able to visit."

Then walked through the park which is stunning. It is a great place to have a picnic as there are loads of people doing the same. It is big enough to find more secluded spots as well.

It seems like a very well designed public space with numerous crossing footpaths and clear signs for people walking and biking. There's an open air theatre and at least two cafe/restaurants. You will also find lots of food and ice cream stands dotted around. It's an interesting place to explore for the eccentric public art, fountains, ponds, bridges and food. We ate and had wine at Vondel 3 while people watching which was lovely.The highlight of the visit for me was Tulip Island (pictured) It's a roofed bandstand in the middle of a pond with a bridge surrounded by tulips. Visitors seemed to be able to pick tulips for a fee. I didn't go onto the island just relaxed and read by the banks of the pond.The only negative I can think of is how busy the park is. We were there on a Monday afternoon so I think it probably gets even busier at the weekends. Although the park is big I don't think it's large enough to hold that many people and still allow some calm and peace. That said, I'm sure if you were determined you would find somewhere off the beaten track. Another reviewer also mentioned homeless people and beggars. I did notice them but they were harmless and they are no more a problem here than any other urban park I've been to in Europe."

There were bikes everywhere and the tracks were full so we took our time and made our way around the entire park. We saw a large cafe nearby, Groot Melkhuis caf\u00e9 that had a large play area for our kids to let loose so we stopped, ate our lunch and had a cup of coffee at the nearby tables. It was great, we got to relax and watch them run around and make new friends for nearly 2 hours because they refused to leave. Two ice creams and another 1/2 hour riding our bikes around the park we headed back into the city, experts at bike riding and fond of Vondelpark.We'll be back soon for more riding adventures!!"

On our last day, a Saturday, we bought some cheese, meat, bread and wine at Markt and had a picnic in the park next to a pond. We so enjoyed hanging out with mostly locals and their dogs and soaking up the sun. There was an ice cream truck so we topped off our little picnic with ice cream.

Quite a lot of dry dusty areas and no flower garden that I could see. I really couldn't see what the guidebooks had been raving about.Don't go out of your way to seek this place out.

It is however, very big but well worth the time to take a morning, afternoon or evening stroll just to earn yourself some fresh air. My boyfriend and I visited the park in the late afternoon after the whole day of visiting other crowded attractions in Amsterdam. You need to be careful when you wanted to cross the other side of the road as you will need to avoid being hit a massive amount of cyclists. They also have the infamous \"I AMSTERDAM\" sign just right in the heart of the park and it is very much less crowded compared to the ones in front of Rijksmuseum so I guess that would be a bonus. Perfect place to have a picnic if you like but remember to take your rubbish with you!"

Just spent 1.5 hours wandering through this park on a late hot summer Sunday afternoon, before the Whit bank holiday- it was heaving , largely with young people and young families: lots of cyclists, some roller skaters but most were picnicking or BBQing in party- like groups complete with bunting hanging from trees. I suppose when many Amsterdam residents live in flats it is not surprising they take to the park for the day! Interesting to see. I recommend you leave the park briefly on the south side - along Koningslaan ( you can get back in at the Hoofstraat gate) and look at the lovely houses backing onto the park and canal ( including the British Consulate) The park itself has lovely shaded planted walks and lakes."

Very close to so many really unique restaurants and stylish shops that you can combine a trip to Amsterdam's \"South\" and escape the tourists. Being a New Yorker, its really like Central Park also surrounded by the excitement of the city but so close to the finest shops and restaurants not to mention the Museum of Modern Art and the Metroplitan. In the summer don't forget the weekend music festival."

It close by to many museums so there is other things to do too. There seemed to be some kind of music on stage during our visit. We did not stay as it was packed out but had we planned things better we may of got a seat. However, that's not what we went for anyway so no loss to us. We grabbed a few beers in one of the caf\u00e9 bars in the park which was nice and relaxing, although the wife's sent her tea back as the glass was a it dirty. Minor irritation for her and it was quickly replaced so again no biggie for us. We also took a hot dog of one of the vans which was very typical and tasty and reasonably priced given the location around 3.50 euros each. We have paid much more in London Parks for the same fare!All in order, a good location to visit on a nice day. I sure there is much more to do than have a picnic but beware of the bikes and watch out for the young ones, cyclists are not very observant and kiddies are bound to get into bother if left unattended. Otherwise, enjoy your day."

Wild areas, trees and mown grass - also an open air concert which could still be heard on the other side of the lake - and very relaxing and laid back ambiance if you chose to do this and bring a picnic rather than buy a ticket to be in the audience. A nice place to relax and recoup your strength for the next activity - only 5 or so minutes walk from the Museum plein. Don't forget to look for the sculptures in the wall of the underpass - there is also a picasso statue which I did not have time to look for"

            "review": "Vondelpark. Named after the poet Joost van den Vondel, sometimes described as the Dutch Shakespeare, the Vondelpark is to Amsterdam what Central Park is to New York City. Running out from pretty near to the heart of Amsterdam, like Central Park it has traditions going back to the ideas of what a central city park should be about. Though it doesn't boast a reservoir (it does have several arty ponds) it is a tranquil and leafy arm out from the centre. If you're cycling it's a breath of fresh air, offering in its length a good car-free connection from the centre out westwards.At the heart of the park is its open-air theatre. On a warm summer evening the atmosphere can be magical. Since the 1970s it has been a centre for remarkable performances.Today the open air theatre has come a long way from the original makeshift stageIt is about to announce its 40-year since opening celebration programme for 2014 on http://www.openluchttheater.nl/programma. In the line-up there'll be no shortage of stuff in English or where language isn't important so don't be put off by the Dutch website - translate where necessary - and check out the programme. All performances are free. Just roll up and take a seat!There are caf\u00e9s and a pleasant restaurant in the former film museum / pavilion.At present the \"special species\" field is host to a stork nest. Stork Piet, the breeding male for a number of years now, has a bad leg and there has been considerable controversy about whether we should intervene and fix it or let nature take its course. Although he holds the roost at the moment, he will, because of his leg, be unlikely to be able to mount and fertilise his current mate this year. If he falls from dominancy another male stork will be likely to spot her and fly in to take his place.If you're visiting Amsterdam, even for a short time, you should certainly plan at least a walkthrough of the park. It will help you get the feel of the city, its history and its present-day culture. If the weather's in any way clement (which it usually is) then it's a great way to relax after say a concentrated diet of museums and cultural venues."

Reaching the park is no issue, one just has to get down at the Rijksmuseum tram stop. The place is just a 10 minute tram ride or a 20 minute cycle ride from Amsterdam Centraal. There are many street food shops within the park selling hot dogs or ice cream if you want cheap food. There are also a few fine dine places within the park. I saw a group of people bringing their own barbecue to the place and having a blast ( the cooking and playing all have designated spots).The park also has an Iamsterdam insignia in case you were wondering where to get one of those signs and have your photos clicked. Overall a really nice place to see and relax. Even taking a walk in this park is beautiful."

Took ages to find the playground in the centre belonging to the cafe but it was worth it the kids had a great time in there on the body castle and sandpit. I imagine it gets so busy on hot summer days so the only improvement I would make is to have some of the park inaccessible to cycles as it can get a bit crammed for people wanting to walk and take in the scenery"

It was really temperate with plenty of small ponds, trail off-shoots, animals, etc. We even had a couple of folks promoting their band by cycling around in a push-cart type setup handing out cards which was nice. I'd highly recommend spending an afternoon enjoying your friends, the environment and Amsterdam in this park."

There we saw ducks and many spices of birds! People there go for a walk some of them with their dogs, other go for running and other just riding their bikes!If you have children Vondelpark has 6 playgrounds! It is the best park i've ever visit!!! If i lived in Amsterdam certainly i would visted Vondelpark every day!!! I recommend it without doubt!!

With most of Amsterdam taken up by buildings, canals and roads its a treat to find such an expansive green space, even though as a walker or runner you still have to fight the bicycles. It can easily be \"just a park\" if you're used to wide open spaces or haven't been in cities for long, but short of Amsterdam Bos, there's not much nature, which makes this a nice place to be."

We arrived by plane on Sunday afternoon and a lot of places - including restaurants - closed early. We wandered into the park for something to do and hopefully something to eat! It was busy with locals enjoying the unusually warm weather. It was a nice enough park but really didn't have much to offer (starving) tourists. The Trip Advisor write up states, \"a popular place for tourists and residents who can enjoy a variety of outdoor activities such as biking, hiking, jogging and picnicking\" but since we weren't really doing any of those things and were, instead, desperate to find a restaurant open on a Sunday - we were disappointed. However, if we didn't log so many sight seeing miles and wanted an early morning jog this may well have been the spot. Eventually we came across a round stone building that turned out to be a cafe. We sat outside and each had a cold beer - that lifted our spirits some - before exiting the park. It turned out Vondelpark was not ideal for our first stop in Amsterdam. Sorry, Amsterdammers!"

If you are in Amsterdam and are sick of all the sex, cannabis, busy streets, tourists etc etc, and you just wanna chill, come to Vondelpark!Its basically the equivalent of Central Park in Manhattan. Its a nice getaway from all the mayhem outside. Ideal to cycle around.And if you must know, you can happily smoke a joint in there providing you do it out of the way and not directly in front of kids."

Lots of cyclists and people jogging there all day , doesnt matter what timee you get there. has a few lakes with the usual ducks, swans etc. Perfect for chilling out, after the loud city. All the food vans are ridiculously dear, (0,5l water 2 euro, hot-dog 6euro etc) and hard to find a public toilet working or just open! recommended to go before you get to the park :) or do it in the bushes!"

The former filmmuseum had a great cafe-terrace called Vertigo, but the city in its infinite wisdom decided to close it and sell/give it to a broadcasting company, which was/is an outrage and a slap in the face to evcery local. this summer saw a temporrary replacement but it wasn't as good at all, hopefully they create something better next year.But of course the very best spot is a place in the grass and just enjoy the fresh air.

In the morning we go to Vondelpark for our morning regime, as it is a 12-minute walk from our flat. It is a great place to exercise and we have been seeing the same people in the morning. There are also yoga groups who practice on the lawns as well as other kinds of workout groups. It takes about 70 minutes door to door, doing a walk/run.Also in the morning, the municipal workers are cleaning up so the park is in shape for the day. The flowers are very nice and it more green space than some formal gardens. We also enjoyed watching the resident stork with her chicks whose nest is well off the path and protected from people and dogs, but is viewable for birders.Speaking of dogs, they are very well-behaved, and owners are very good about cleaning up after them. I have found this park to be an enjoyable part of living here, and can't wait for the Pavillion to be finished with renovations in April of next year!"

Nice park, would go again. People smoking cannabis. Close to city centre. Great for people watching. Stage for concerts, not being used when we were there. Clean park. Enjoyed."

I think if you come from somewhere where you do not have nice parks, you might be impressed by this one. I was not impressed. The grounds were not very well kept in my opinion and the landscaping was average. After reading so much about it, I thought it would be better. We walked through and walked out. Good for a stroll but not somewhere I long to picnic."

The park has a lot of entrances, so it is quite convenient to pay it a visit where ever you stay. The more popular is the one near Leidseplein. The park has a lot of ponds and a couple of cafes and restaurants. The best option, though, is to grab something to eat and drink, lie on the grass, enjoy the weather, see the birds and the bees and just CHILL. There are three (maybe more) BBQ points in the park as well, good to congregate and party. The park has a lot of garbage bins for the revellers, but not everybody uses them though,which is quite sad. This summer, the Gementee (municipality) has made a provision for around 10 portable toilets in the park, which has mde the park more popular, I am sure. A must visit place for visitors to Amsterdam and a frequent haunt for residents of the city."

With the failure which was trying to visit the Anne Frank house, which had a enormous queue, stilling fresh in our mind - we needed to find something to do, which was also a unique selling point of Amsterdam. We found ourselves visiting Vondelpark!When we visited on a cloudy, drizzly Thursday afternoon. It was a beautiful, tranquil location to visit with many paths to explore, large ponds and the ambient noise of birdsong (and raindrops in our case). Inside we spotted a stage area, and an open air cinema area. There were also a number of what looked like bars and restaurants inside the park, we didn't check these out.When we went it was fairly quiet, although as usual there were a fair amount of cyclists about. On a sunny day, this would be a fantastic location to stroll for a couple of hours, or sit down and enjoy a beer near a pond. However I can also imagine that it gets quite crowded on a sunny day.It felt like somewhere you needed to pay to be, however no, this is a fantastic public park and was one of the highlights of the trip. I think the stop we got out at was \"Van Baerlestraat\" on tram 5, but you can also just walk there from Museum Quarter (\"Museumplein\" stop)."

There is a large paved perimeter road if you wish to skate or cycle, but the nicest paths wind through the park, where you'll find water features and even a rose garden. If you go on a hot weekend afternoon you will find mayhem, which can be fun and colourful if you like other people's BBQ smoke and someone else's taste in rap music. After 11 it's the domain of the guys who sit and drink strong, cheap lager and fall asleep on the park benches. Join the fun or set your alarm and see it in peace."

Stayed there until 3:30am, and a cop came by. He looked at me as I had a cannabis cigarrete and an open bottle of alcohol by my side (both of which are illegal). I did not react because I am no criminal. He just let it go and walked away without saying a word. So it really reflected once again the dutch spirit of \"don't bother me, I won't bother you\".If you're going to stay there and keep it to yourself, great. Make sure you remember people live near the park and noise may be a disturbance. You don't want to disturb anyone when you visit their city and they don't want to disturb your party.Have fun!"

As a road cyclist, I found it fascinating, entertaining and quite intimidating. Our week in Amsterdam featured 4 days of sunshine, so the locals were out in throngs.

Earlier that day someone had told us she enjoyed taking at least part of her holidays at home in Amsterdam and I can imagine this would be a good reason. There are lots of trees and streams with little bridges and places serving food and drinks so you can unwind on your own or amid company.The easiest access is by tram and there are many different trams that run alongside the Vondelpark. You just need a map that shows the tram numbers and routes. I guess it would be at least an hour's walk south from Central Station but quite accessible by bicycle if you rent one."

The lake/ water features had lots of algae, although admittedly, city workers were running loud machines in an attempt to get control of the problem. We strolled through the park in late morning, and there were still plenty of hung over partiers sitting on park benches with a glazed look in their eyes, smoking cigarettes or pot. We were told by the locals that there are people who live in houses within the park boundaries.

Walked to the park from Conservatorium hotel on Museumplein,:Cross the street and follow the trams round the corner, then turn right at the cafe on the corner. We picked up delicious rolls with cheeses, ham etc made to order by an excellent wineshop across the street ( a friendly customer buying his lunch to take back to his office informed us it was one of the best in Amsterdam) and five minutes later were in Vondelpark. Wide paved paths (but as everywhere in Amsterdam watch out for the cyclists as not all warn you they are about to run you down!). Beautiful walks in the centre of the city, lake, masses of seats on which to laze or watch the ducks etc on the lake - just a pleasure to be there on a fine summer's day. There is a coffee shop - no frills but good coffee in this beautiful spacious , well treed 'green lung'. Accessible from many points as takes up a large area. Near Museumplein there are several small restaurants for before or after your walk if a picnic doesn't appeal: one diagonally across the road from the hotel (does good breakfasts and prices at dinner for a wonderful Dover sole HALF the price of the upmarket restaurant down the road opposite the Concertgbouw), A deli next door, but recommend the wineshop further down the street, or the cafe across the street on the corner down which you can reach Vondelpark.. Excellent coffee and good food in the cafe. Very reasonable prices at all these establishments."

What flowers were selected meant there was a splash of purple here and there. Dead tulips were there too.In the bushes you could see weeds as tall as your waist.There were men looking around suspiciously and when we past them, they smelt like the \"coffee houses\".You have to watch out for cyclists as they don't seem to care about pedestrians.

Europeans generally have less space in their living quarters than we Americans have, so a lot of their lives, especially their leisure time, is spent in bars, restaurants and parks such as this one. You will see people playing at many different sports, reading, \"courting\", sunbathing, etc. This is a nice place to walk around on a sunny day. I don't know why this is considered as a tourist \"thing to do\" since it's really no different than Hyde Park in London or Central Park in New York."

There were a number of sculptures around in the park when we were there, and that added to it. Although there were a lot of people about, walking and biking, there were many green areas to sit in by some water and read and relax. I think there are cafes about too, but we didn't go there.So close (within) the city, easy to find, and a nice looping walk down one side and up the other. Great to do after visiting a museum, to clear the head and enjoy the great outdoors!"

There are a few small lakes and I could easily see plastic bottles and polythene bags floating around. Grass were long as if it has not been mowed since ages. Lot of people on the bikes not caring for anyone in the way.Just to confirm if I was seeing really what was there, I visited the park once again next morning, but situation was the same. I am not sure if I visited the park at the wrong time as I am surely confused by the excellent review people have given this park. There must be wrong in the first week of May.

It is quite pretty, but is not anything out of the ordinary. The English Garden in Munich and Central Park in NY can be noted as sites to be seen, but not really Vondelpark in my view. If the park happens to be on your way to a destination, then definitely walk through it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to walk through this park.That being said, it was pretty cold, dark and overcase each time we walked through, so perhaps it is quite different on a beautiful sunny day."

Commuters rushing to work, Mum's strolling home with the toddlers after dropping big brother or sister at school and joggers & cyclists getting their exercise.There are also plenty of coffee shops and cafes nearby so you can treat yourself after your workout."

It can get quite busy on the walking/biking path so if your dog is a bit exciteable as mmy little doggy-friend can be, it is best to keep your dog to the designated dog play area. There are BBQ areas and a couple of play gym areas for the kiddies.

It was early February so there wasn't much colour in the flower beds. There were plenty of parakeets flying around and singing for all they were worth. In the late spring I imagine it to be lovely. In all the time we were there I never saw a fat Dutchman or woman and in this park they are either running or cycling like mad or walking dogs. The cycling can be a nuisance especially about 8:45 in the morning on a week day, when most of Amsterdam are cycling to work (bikes are King here) it makes it so difficult to cross the park paths, it's like watching a never ending table tennis match trying to find a gap to cross.

Even though it was rather chilly and spring this year is very late and Vondelpark is still rather \"wintery\" we enjoyed the atmosphere. Just looking at all the people jogging, walking their dogs, playing with their children or just strolling around in the sunny but crisp weather was a wonderful way to spend a few hours. So if you want to see another side to Amsterdam which is only a short walk from the center we can recommend a stroll in Vondelpark."

In the spring and summer cycle through relatively early and be amused by the doggie training classes, quacking ducks, sulking herons and the infamous, cackling green parrots. Take a picnic and just kick back next to one of the lakes or for the more enthusiastic, there's plenty of room for Frisbees and other such energetic stuff. There is a formal children's play area, tennis courts and the avenues are wide enough for cyclists, rollerbladers, joggers and everyone else. There are tea-rooms, open air theatres, bars and restaurants aplenty. In the winter - all of the above apart from the picnic!"

It's where all the beautiful people are!\" He had apparently camped out there in the love and mushroom Fest period of the park in the early 70's. I was excited to get some great portraits of said people and so I got my better camera around my neck and headed off for the day. It was July so of course Amsterdam weather wise it was \"all seasons in one day\". I had an umbrella and hat stowed in my bag and a sweater tied around my waist, and layered tops on. You just can't be sure what will happen in the sky from hour to hour even in \"high\" season. When I left my pad on Prinsengracht it was sunny but blustery. Vondelpark entrance has a photogenic vintage gate and opens into what is a general plan to an English rose garden, but its a 120 acre rose garden. The park was first developed for strolling and riding in the 1860s and it seems it has had a turbulent history between walkers and riders and more recently with people wanting City permission to have sex in the park legally as long as they \"took their garbage with them\". Here is an excerpt from Vereniging Vrienden van het Vondelpark which is Vondelpark's newsletter from 'Friends of Vondelpark', \"Already in the 1880s and 1890s the cycling in the park caused hindrance. First the park management tried to resolve this with restrictive measurements against cyclists, such as special bike paths, limited opening hours, and fines for cyclists that were going faster than a horse's trot. It was only after mediation of the Algemene Nederlandsche Wielrijders-Bond ('General Dutch Cyclists Union'), that helped fund the park, that a park guard was installed and cyclists were again permitted to cycle normally.\" The Park sports a tea house, a small Film museum, a bandstand, some statuary, and a water feature. Lots of people with strollers and jogging shoes, and lots of bikes, no hippies, no spectacle, just small clutches of neo-dreaded pot smoking local happy people singing and talking. The Park itself while pretty, was unremarkable and tidy (I stayed away from the bushes), BUT the \"Lost and Found\" towers are a great read, and the decorated bicycles of certain individuals who festoon their baskets or handlebars with fake flowers and what-not are quaint. I appreciate this creative effort and it helped me remember I was in Amsterdam. So don't grumble about the bikers and get out of the way people!"

Green grass, gently flowing waterways - very popular for walkers, joggers, cyclists and people with children or dogs. Lots of nice wide, paved paths and many smaller unpaved. Highly recommended for a place to stroll!"

Go to the Albert Heijn, by some snacks and drinks, cycle (or walk) to the Vondelpark and enjoy a day at the park amongst locals.During the summer months the park can be very crowded so finding a spot might take a while, but once you find the right place you can start relaxing. Tip: watch out when walking in the park, since a lot of people use the park to cycle towards the city center and other places, walking their dogs, running and other ways dutch like to get around (motorized vehicles are not allowed)."

In the winter evening, the park is still full of city dwellers spending time with family, friends and dogs. . and a handful of tourists like us. You can find street musicians playing beautiful music (sometimes sad tunes). The pathways seem endless. There are signs of vandalism which I hope will be improved.Just walk around abd enjoy the park.

There are beautiful and rare flowers (including orchids), a stork (in season), many very nice people and it is a holiday at home, away from home. A must do experience!"

So many locals there too. I visited on a rainy day waiting for the taxi to the airport after we had checked out and it was still busy. There is a rose garden, ponds, wildlife, a cafe, a stage for performances, plenty of benches and an area in the centre which is not maintained that is for the native wildlife to stay undisturbed. I did a bit of googling the night before to see what there was to do and on doing a bit of Internet digging I read that vondelpark is refurbed every thirty years as it built on basically swamp land so that the ground level is constantly being lowered by nature, so to keep it in use Amsterdam have to dig it all up and start again basically! I thoroughly recommend this area. I can imagine it being stunning in the sun!"

First I picked up an inexpensive chicken salad lunch at the Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn (love that store) and went for a long stroll from one end of Vondelpark to the other. I enjoyed my lunch while people watching. A really great way to lower your blood pressure and enjoy a true Amsterdam experience."

Turned out the waitress had just put it on the side and didn't bother bringing it to our table - it was nearly stone cold by then. This attracted a disinterested shrug.But the park itself is safe - there are always police patrolling around, and plenty of people passing through. Watch out for the obligatory set of drunks - although they seem harmless enough on the whole."

I have seen collisions happen before, though they are rarely (if ever) serious.I cycled through this place and saw large groups of people sitting around simplying enjoying themselves doing nothing - a really good place to relax. According to a local, there is a hippie crowd that gathers regularly, though I did not encounter any during my visit."

Or do you need to either relacs, \"hang out\" or exercise while you are in Amsterdam? In Vondelpark you can do all this!Fist of all, it's beautiful - really estetic with small \"lakes\" and \"rivers\", a big variation of trees, flowers and bushes. It's very well organiced with roades. You can walk, run or go by bycycles. You meet people in all ages, dogs, and if you get hungry - why not take a brake at one of the restaurants/cafes in the park. The only thing that annoyed me, is that I had to pay to use the toilette in the restaurants I visited. It doesn't matter about the money (50 cents), but it's not nice that the guests have to pay for it!Vondelpark is close to many of the museums (Van Gogh), so you can combine the two events and have a really nice day."

You could give him a donation but he was quite modest and didn't ask for one. There is a playground for kids and a clean toilet you can use for a small fee. I would recommend a trip here when you visit Amsterdam. Great fun on a bike or on foot and lovely gardens and ponds/lakes to enjoy on a nice day."

Nice park, although like most of Amsterdam watch out for the cyclists who seem to show no regard to saftey of pedestrians or any common sense - they will crash into you whilst talking on mobile in one hand and their cigarette in the other hand with a plaster cast on their arm.(presumably from a previous crash?) I kid you not - the worst example of cyclist disregard we encountered.There are it seems 'paths' which are for bikes in the park (like the rest of the city), and unpathed 'tracks' for pedestrians - which when wet are boggy and even dry no use for pushchairs as uneven. Even sticking to the 'tracks' you'll have to cross the 'paths' numerous times. Walking around the park with young children is NOT enjoyable as you are constantly looking out for idiots paying no attention on where they are going on their bike.However, the grassed/fenced areas are superb and a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of the busy amsterdam streets. The kids play area is great with sand pits, water fountains, stepping stones, but there are no small child swings or slides to much disappointment of our two year old - in fact - there was no slide at all.If visiting with children a welcome spot (once you reach it) to finally relax and not have to stress about them getting run over by a bike. If visiting without kids, still worth a stroll and sit to relax and enjoy a bit of welcome peace and quiet from the rest of the city."

It's relaxing and beautiful, very large and easy to find your own little spot to sit and chill and have a picnic. Watch out for the amazing tropical birds that look completely out of place in the trees. There is a great cafe/restaurant in the centre that looks a bit run down when you are approaching, but head up to the second level for fantastic food and service. Great spot to stop for a beer or a bite to eat, full of locals.We also stumbled across this giant play structure/treehouse (see photos). We spent some time playing around on it, feeling like kids again. Fun! Great spot for people watching. Worth a visit if you're in Amsterdam."

We saw two places to eat or have a coffee. We went to the self service one and had our afternoon coffee and a sandwich there. It was very enjoyable to see Amsterdam natives doing their thing. It is also amazing to see all the different types of bicycles and the many things they put on them. We saw some bikes that could carry up to three kids! In the evening, many people were picnicing and BBQing. It was less busy and had more of a party atmosphere than in the morning. There was also a free concert going on.

Large bike trails and separate walking trails, but enough space that it doesn't get too crowded. The BBQ areas (at the tips of the park) are packed with people and delicious smelling smoke billowing into the air but if you aren't BBQ-ing, space shouldn't be an issue.Saw park security once but everyone keeps to themselves. We went on a weekday afternoon so it was not as busy but around 5-6pm, the park was filled with people jogging after work, riding through the park on their way home, and groups of people partaking in various activities (yoga, stretching, exercising, running, etc.)Bathrooms are a bit obscure in this park. However, you can go to the restaurants and use their facilities for 50 cents (same as anywhere else in Amsterdam). Must see park if you are in Amsterdam. Hit up some of the markets in the city centre for cheese, bread, and some wine and it'll be a fun afternoon."

We biked around the park; it has a great bike path that had plenty of space for both bikes and pedestrians. The park was full of city-dwellers enjoying a day in the sun -- thus, it was a great place to people-watch, too. The park was beautifully green with tons of lawns, benches, etc. A great retreat! Plan to spend an afternoon here during a visit to Amsterdam -- bike around the park and then have a picnic."

Also a great place for joggers !However for food, there is only one cafe that is over priced/low quality food. Don't plan on eating there.

It is a nice park in the middle of the city - kind of like Central Park in NYC (but seemingly less crowded). I would say my three star rating is somewhat biased in the sense that I was only here for a short trip and with so many things to see or visit in the city, spending too much time in the park didn't seem like the best use of time. Sure it's a nice park and on a nice day it's probably really nice, but with limited time, I wouldn't make it a top priority. (I spent about half an hour here)"

If you find a lost item in the park, just clip it on the Findfence with the provided clips and the owner will have an easier time finding it.The scenery is classic architecture, a lazy river, trees, and the occasional sculpture. It is a popular park with many people. I highly recommend a stroll."

It is situated in a posh neighbourhood and it was constructed late 19th century.It is nicely laid out and especially in the summer a good place for biking, rollarblading, walking or just sitting around. Unfortunately with the new prim and proper policy of Amsterdam's labour party governance, there is a crack down on drinking beer in the park.Smoking pot and snorting coke apparenlt is tolerated, but sit down with a beer and you can expect to be bothered by cops.Nevertheless a nice place to be, to sit and enjoy and do people watching.If you have time, walk all the way to the end of the park, it is more dense there and less people. I know that some time ago there still was a farm there with cows, but not sure if it still is operational.Visit the following attractions:Vondelparkpavillion dated 1881. Italian renaissance style. It houses the Film museum and caf\u00e9-restaurant Vertigo.De Muziektent (The band stand) dated 1874.Het Openluchttheater (Open air Theatre) dated 1955. Free shows during the summerHet Blauwe theehuis (The Blue Teahouse) dated 1936Het Melkhuis (The Milking House) dated 1874. Once part of the farm that was still in the park, it houses a playground for kidsHet snoephuisje (The Candy House) dated 1927 at the back entrance on Amstelveenseweg, built in Indonesian style"

There are amphitheaters for music concerts, a movie theater for special screenings, nice cafes and eateries for refreshments, lots of pathways for you to choose your own route through the park. Nice place to sit in the sun (when it is out) and read a book if you want to rest a bit during your trip through the city. You will forget that you are in the middle of a city, with the expansive greenery in the park. Definitely one of my favorite weekend haunts."

You'll see people lazing on the grass with their loved ones or reading a book, people bicycling, dogs being walked, birds being fed. It's a large park with a few ponds and a fountain. There is a network of paved and unpaved trails for walking, rollerblading or bicycling and I believe 3 cafes and restaurants. It's overall just a great place to spend time relaxing. If you want to rent a bicycle there is a Mac Bikes rental shop near the park but some friends who rented there advised that the service is bad. If you're near Valkenburgerstraat (where the Jewish Historical Museum is), I recommend renting from Boka Scooters!"

The park was located behind our hotel The Vondel .... when we first arrived it was a sunny day so we grabbed a couple of snacks and headed to the park. We found it be full of interesting people and a very laid back group of kids hanging back smoking of the weed. So we sat down and had our lunch along side of the small pond that was surrounded by young folk on the west end of the park. It was awesome very peaceful and relaxing. The only drawback I saw was that everyone just thru their trash on the ground and left it there.... it was blowing into the water so we picked up around our area and set out to the other end of the park where we found art work and fountains to be enjoyed by all.... so if you want to get off of the busy streets head to vondel park look for the picasso standing there in the weeds .... in my neighborhood if there was a picasso left out like that it would be on sell on e-bay the next day .... such a cool place"

I went with my family to the park two times. The park gets pretty packed . I only have one gripe. The park is very bike and stroller friendly but I noticed that most people are not stroller friendly. I had more than a few people give me the why arent you moving out of my way look. Im pushing a double stroller,,,anyone who has done it knows its not the easiest thing to manuver.

It epitomises the life of Amsterdam - laid back, relaxed and very cool and trendy.We visited with 5 kids 12, 11, 3, 2 and a 6 month old and there really is something for everyone. My friend (who lives there) says the BBQ's and litter can be overwhelming on a warm weekend day, but we didn't see any of that (though it was sunny) Just the occasionally guitarist playing some fab tunes and people sitting around looking very relaxed........in the way people do in Amsterdam!I would recommend it. Anyone from the States will feel its a home from home and, despite the expensive cost of living (made worst by the Euro/Sterling exchange rate of almost 1:1) its a great place to be!"

This is a city that has lots and lots of cyclists, where cyclists have right of way of pedestrians, yet it can be a bit intimidating. Also, cyclists and people riding scooters that have a low cc rating don\u2019t tend to wear helmets.Vondelpark is a huge park located South West of the centre of Amsterdam and we were very glad we took the bikes otherwise we would not have seen as much of it."

It was lovely to sit on the benches and people watch, to stop in one of the many cafes for a cup of tea, and it was amazingly quiet considering that you were in the middle of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, in my opinion. It was warm enough so that the \"baby pool\" still had small children playing in the water, very sweet to watch for a while.

On a warm early June evening about 7 pm (the high latitude means that the sun is still high in the sky at that time), the pathways were packed with bikers, runners, skaters and others. The park was laid out in a typical Europe manner--tightly constructed with every element carefully organized--although at least we could walk on the grass (unlike the Paris parks). I personally do not like these overly manicured parks very much. There's something to be said for raw nature, not nature reinterpreted by people. I also got nervous for my personal safety in some of the less well-traveled parts of the park, especially around stoner hill where everyone was brashly toking up in public."

Regardless, Vondel reminds me of Holland as a whole: tolerant, carefree, peaceful, did I mention tolerant?You can stroll through this park on the way to several museums as it is located in the very posh Museum Quarter. It's also on the way to Peter Cornelisz (P.C.) Hooftstraat, the high end shopping district. I'm not sure a tourist would get much from visiting for an extended amount of time (depends). This park is meant to be used and you won't find many flowers; just grassland, trees and bushes. Very utilitarian. As you may have heard, Amsterdam has a live and let live attitude and this extends to the parks- in fact, especially to the parks. At Vondel you'll see the following: runners, walkers, people doing drugs, kids at play, picnics, couples making love in the bushes, and gawking tourists (it's a big place). Everyone living their lives side by side without judgement. I'm usually uncomfortable around open drug use but oddly it seems sort of \"natural\" here.There are several great cafes along the perimeter of the park; be SURE that you ask what the small cake you are buying contains since hallucinogenics are popularly sold in baked goods. All in all, a microcosm of the Dutch lifestyle."
