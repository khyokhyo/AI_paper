            "review": "Excellent . Ricardo was my tour guy. He was fun, accommodating, and knowledgeable diver. He made me feel very safe every minute. I was in a small group of 5. There was another group of about the same. There is no basic enterance. Tour is a must to keep us safe. One of the best experiences I have had in Riviera Maya so far. I am not fond of group tours but this was a great one worth the money I paid (500 pesos or 30 usd). If you are looking for an experience in Rio Secreto at a cheaper price then I strongly suggest this ( although two are different while being similar). I paid taxi 90 on the way there and 70 on the way back at near the end of Juarez avenue away from Playa. Cab drivers ask $150-200 but you can negotiate. Again Ricardo did a great job guiding us along the cave it was a little more than 2 hr tour in the end. Ask them to call a cab for you. They will."

Knowledgeable, caring, and organized. The swim through the cenotes was exciting and inspiring. We were given a locker, water shoes, life vest, flashlights, and snorkel equipment. A beautiful walk through the jungle led to the caverns where we took several swims. The water was a bit chilly, but not a problem. Afterwards we enjoyed a simple mayan lunch, and a tequila tasting and talk. This was definitely the highlight of our week! I am not in great shape but was able to do all the physical aspects of the tour."

It is stunning and you will get some great pictures but with 50 other people in the background. You have to move with the masses in and out of the water. Maybe find a time when hundreds of other people aren't there. Bring money for a locker if you plan on swimming."

The only thing that was bothering us is that we paid 500 pesos per person and the guide told us that his job was voluntary, so it makes you feel you need to give him a nice tip, cause eventually he was great guide. So I wonder to whom those 1000 pesos were going to if the guides are not getting paid??"

Entered the cold waters but honestly only lasted 10 minutes because i became frighten by being inclosed and underground. First time experiencing it but somehow hesitant to stay longer. Seen some bats in the cave they didn't bother us. Water was cold and clear blue. Intimidated by some of the fish in the water and some of the dark areas. However worth visiting to capture good pictures and witness its hidden beauties."

The staff was incredibly friendly, patient and kind. You won't see billboards and flyers for this place which means they don't have to charge you $150 per person like some of the other places. Way better than only other place we have been. I highly recommend you take taxi and see one of the coolest natural attractions in the area."

            "review": "Awesome Check it out Something for everyone at this great Cenote. For some reason this Cenote doesn't seem to get all the hype you find in some adventure parks or other main tour path like on the way to Chichen Itza. We felt very safe at this facility and the staff , gear , language, Mayan lunch and good restrooms etc were nice. So the surprises were the amount of dry trails you can explore on your own after the snorkeling at your leisure and take as many pictures as you want. The caverns twist and turn so lots to see. Beautiful underworld experience you will remember always. With snorkel gear you get flashlights and excellent close support. You will find fun little fish that nibble on your hands and toes in places and there are also bats in crevices above that you may see. You may or may not get this offer on your tour but they may ask if anyone wants to venture underwater to another small room you surface in and then move again under water to another narrow cave that you swim along to get to a large other main room that is on private property they get permission to go to. If you get this chance by all means do this. Only takes 5 min to get access to 2nd main room. The wetsuits hold the water against your body so this keeps you warm as it heats up. You will get the help you need if you are not sure about anything about snorkeling. They can explain more about it to you if needed."

We ride the speedboat and our guide, pabio, pick us up with a nice van with ac. It took less then 20 mins to arrive. We pick up our snorkel mask, flash light and water shoes. The water inside the cenote is cold, but your body will get use to it. I took my 18 months son and it was too cold for him. He was crying for the entire time and I felt sorry for him and my tour mate. The cave is beautiful and it is a very unique experience. The swim lasted for hour and then they offer lunch in another cave. There is a tequila tasting presentation after lunch. Overall I really like it."

My only negative comment would be to give every person a flashlight instead of each couple. The caves can be vary dark. This tour is also not for those who have difficulty walking, especially up and down stairs or those unable to bend and maneuver through tight spots. Our guide was knowledgeable and showed passion for what he did. We got to exfoliate using the calcium which was fantastic. Our tour included lunch and tequila tasting. Make sure to bring cash for this!!! They give a great education on how to tell organic vs commercial tequila."

It may not be recommended for the faint of heart, but I would love to go back and would recommend it without a doubt. We didn't even know this existed and thanks to our private guide Monica we could experience this magical place. Clear, ice cold water, stalactites everywhere, bats flying around while you swim/walk and an overall feeling that can't be described.If you have the chance to go, do it. You won't regret it."

The tour takes approximately 3-5 hours. The guides are very kind and respectful and do speak English very well. An authentic Mayan lunch was served during our tour. Modern facilities (bathrooms) are provided and it looked as if improvements were beginning. Our group consisted of approximately 16 people ranging in age from 12-60+ with varying degrees of mobility. Some of the restrictions within the cenote (cave) required some ducking and there are a few steps. Overall, for my wife and I it was something we had to experience again."

I would suggest getting your own cab out car service to and from (it was about 400 peso round-trip from 5th Ave in Playa del Carmen)Don't worry about the bats, they don't bother you, just go with it!

            "review": "If you don't visit a cenote while visiting the Yucatan, you're a fool and deserve to have your tourist card revoked.. The way a wet suit works is pretty simple: it retains layer of water between your skin and the suit, which your body heat warms up and keeps you nice and comfortable. I tell you this because if you decide to piss while you're underwater wearing a wet suit, you're going to marinate in Corona and asparagus for the duration of your stay at this cenote. And when you take it off, you and your swimsuit will smell like a hobo in a porta-potty. Some people are into that, which makes me a little wary in disclosing this little tip since I've inadvertently turned on some people I would otherwise steer clear of, but there it is.The Yucatan peninsula is known for rich Mayan history, cenotes, and drunk white people. Visiting Chaak Tun will cover the first two, which are the best parts of this region. There are over 1,000 cenotes in the Yucatan, and if you fail to visit at least one of them, what the hell did you visit this area for? The bottom-shelf liquor at your all-inclusive resort? To hook up with some drunk Ohio State undergrad with a 2.1 GPA in psychology? For goddamn Coco Bongo?Honestly, you can do all that crap and still have time to hit up a cenote. Chaak Tun is maybe 15 minutes from Playa Del Carmen, tops. My girlfriend and I went yesterday, and it was just us and three Brazilian ladies. Normally Brazilians are louder than a Cuban lady doing a fire alarm impression, but these were cool. A tour group of five is ideal, because it gives you enough time to snap some photos and get a good feel for the place without being the jerk who holds everyone up. 500 pesos gets you access, a tour guide, locker, flashlight, vest, wet suit, mask, snorkel, and probably a communicable disease.Our guide, Felipe, gave us a history of cenotes in the Yucatan and some insight into Mayan culture, then took us to two cenotes. The first was a cavern (they\u2019ll explain the difference between a cave and a cavern; I won\u2019t, because I forgot). There were bats everywhere. I learned the difference between stalactites and stalagmites (I forgot). We had a moment of silence underground, in cold water, in complete darkness. It was beautiful. Seeing all the different rock formations, minerals, catfish, turtles, and bats just going about their business in one of the most virgin commercial cenotes was magical. I also offended a few spirits by farting into my wetsuit and giggling when the stinky bubbles ran up my back and came out from my collar. This cavern wraps around and has some great sights. This one alone was worth the ~$25 USD.The second was of the swimming pool variety. It\u2019s just a big circular fresh water pool underground teeming with bats and catfish with a depth of about 15 feet. It\u2019s pretty serene to just float on your back and listen to the chirps of the bats, the light splashes of your wading, and your fart bubbles.Look, for the price of a crappy meal at a crappy place, you\u2019ll be able to see and experience something that very few people alive will ever get to see.Also, the fart bubbles."

When you arrive they let you know that a tour is required and cost $500 pesos. Typically they take up to 10 people but our group ended up being larger. And the frequent requests for tips is going to be part of the experience. The benefits are that all of the equipment, including wetsuits and flashlights are provided, and the cave/cenote experience is unique and amazing. The tour lasts about 2 hours, including time spent in the jungle listening to some history of the mayan culture and bug spray is not allowed. Most of the time is spent in the water underground and it can be a bit chilly but the experience is worth it! Even if you aren't a comfortable swimmer or aren't that excited about going underground exploring, this is a safe enjoyable excursion!"

Even the people in a local dive shop where I bought some stuff hadn't heard of Chaak Tun and it's only 5 miles from downtown. Round trip transport from my condo in Playa was $15 for a new A/C'd van which arrived early. Abel was our guide (maybe 8 people in our group) and he gave us an entertaining (and for the more adventurous, challenging) tour. They provide everything you need.. mask, snorkel, water shoes (no fins allowed), life vests, water proof flashlights and wetsuits. The water in Cenotes is cold so I definitely recommend putting on a wetsuit. The tour is 2 underground water-filled caverns, the main areas of which are large with high ceilings. However, Abel took us on a couple \"excursions\" where there is as little as a foot of space between the water and the stalagmites above... not for the claustrophobic! You can, however refrain from these excursions. Lighting is minimal to maintain the natural atmosphere. This is an in-the-water tour, not a walking tour. It's an incredible look at a world that most people never see and which has been there for (millions?) of years. For me, awesome."

We needed the life jackets because of the depthof the water; we were not rushed at any time to \" get to point A or point B. The cenote was beautiful, with amazing stalactites and stalagmites.

But once you get in there it's amazing!! We had philipe as a guide. You get one guide per family. So it's a very intimate tour and experience. Saw a lot of bats, and fish as well as a resident turtle. Paid 400 pesos for the tour which, isn't that expensive.its about \u00a315 ( around that price). For two hours and a personal tour it's fantastic value for money! The cenotes were beautiful, and philipe was great at telling us about the history of them, and the mayan history. Learnt a lot of information in such a short space of time. If you've got a few hours to kill, definitely go!! You won't regret it!"

Our group of 4 were kitted out (torch, wetsuits, snorkel,) but you can use your own if you wish. Our personal guide, Philippe, was extremely knowledgeable, patient and humorous. He doesn't just explain about the cenotes, he gives lots of info about mexico and mayan history. Our tour lasted around 2 hours and cost 500 pesos each. Valentina offers a disc of around 70 photos at the end, lovely pic's but we didn't buy as we couldn't justify paying the price for something we'd put in a drawer when we got home (and we used our own waterproof camera ) I would highly recommend a visit, taxis from playa are cheap and this is a great family owned cenote.

This was my 4th trip to Mexico over the years but first chance I got to see a cenote despite attempting nearly every time ... being as close as it is to the city, I wasn't expecting it to be great but merely an attempt to check something off my bucket list. TIP there are no taxis out at the cenote, so if you travel in from playa go your round trip option with the cabby for ~450 pesos! They will leave and come back to get you at the end of the tour, they discuss the time frame with the operators at cenote. This cenote is actually privately owned and has been passed down through a Mayan family through generations. Not sure of their hours, we just woke up had breakfast and headed out there ... arrived about 11am, and when we were finished with our tour at about 2/230 they had the gates locked and were turning people away so be aware of that. However, we think this was the perfect time to go! Hardly anyone there and a tour of ~8 spanish speakers set out before us. Luckily we needed an english speaking tour guide ... We basically got a private tour with Abel, and he was fantastic! He took us to some parts of the first cenote most people don't get to see, since it was just us 2 and we were both good swimmers. He was very knowledgeable about the area and was able to answer any of the random questions I had. He also laughed at all my boyfriend's corny jokes without appearing to hate us, also a plus. These guys work for tips so keep that in mind if he gets you into spots you normally wouldn't see with a bigger group. We tipped him 500 pesos but were almost feeling like that was not enough since the tour was so good.Another tip! GoPro footage came out about 50/50 out of what was shot, partly due to having to illuminate all your shots with flashlights etc. especially with the underwater ones. If you have an underwater camera w/ flash, this may be a better option although I am not sure if they are allowed. All in all this was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go back to Mexico and explore yet another cenote a bit further out. If you are on a limited time frame as we were, this is basically right in playa and does not take long to get to, tour, and get back to hotel zone for drinking. We had a very full tour day the day before and didn't want to get trapped on a return tour bus journey of 3 hours like the previous day. This cenote does not disappoint, you will be happy you went!"

It is extremely hot there so if you choose to wear a wetsuit then only put it on up to the waist as he does a little speech about the Mayan's before you go into the cenote. To be honest you don't need a wetsuit, after the initial coldness of the water you get use to it after a few seconds and it's so refreshing on your skin. The facilities there are small and basic, but that's part of the charm. It's a beautiful place, especially when you see the sunlight seeping in through the open part of the cenote. My daughters aged 17, 16 and 12 loved looking at the cute bats and snorkelling. The only reason I didn't give this trip a 5 is because when we visited I had purposely left my camera in the locker, because I knew they took photos, which she did, but when the tour finished and Pablo took us back to the photo desk nobody was there and nobody could help??! They seemed understaffed, it's a shame as I was really looking forwards to seeing the photos. Our waiting taxi driver was getting impatient, as he had to be somewhere else, so we had to leave with only our memories. \u2639\ufe0f"

Book through viator.com ($30 per person) and definitely add on the transportation option it gives you (for us it was $15 round trip per person from Sandos Caracol) - it's half the cost of a cab ride and the money goes to the cenotes! (hint: the local transportation phone number - if you're like me and leave nothing to chance - will be listed only on your voucher, not the email confirmation!)2. Wear a bathing suit but use their wet suit - it gets cold after a while!! They'll give you snorkel gear, a waterproof flashlight, water shoes, and a life vest - use them all (or bring your own). Bring towels - they don't provide them.3. They give you a locker to lock up all your stuff. It's small but fit a backpack, water bottles, towels, and shoes just fine.4. If you have a waterproof camera or case, bring it and make sure it's fully charged because you'll use it the whole time. It will be under water most of the time though so be careful to make sure it's really really waterproof! I brought a separate camera just for this excursion so I didn't risk ruining my phone even though it's in a life proof case.5. Felipe is the best. Seriously. He's a native to the area and not only does he know his stuff but he's fun, friendly, and patient too!6. Plan to spend the $30 they ask for the photo CD at the end. The photographers are really talented and they also give you a ton of professional pics from the cenotes, which are spectacular. Plus the money goes right back to the cenotes!7. Your resort will tell you they don't know what Chaak Tun is or try to sell you a tour to other cenotes or tell you that this place is really small and you should go someplace like Xcaret. Don't believe them - they're either lying, misinformed, or dumb. This place just isn't commercialized like places like Xcaret are and it doesn't advertise on slick brochures and the sides of vehicles. However, it is far superior in every way!! 8. There's no food or drinks there, so bring your own.9. The bathrooms are very...rustic. Very.10. This place is owned by a Mayan family who values the natural beauty here and respects the thousands of years it took nature to create it. Don't touch anything unless your guide tells you it's ok and be careful not to break any stalactites. It takes 10 years for them to grow 1 cm.11. Tip your guide. They deserve it!! :)12. The tour is at least 2 hours long. Plus time for changing and such. Leave a good window of time so you're not rushed - it'll be worth it, I promise!!"

However, I\u2019ve visited enough to tell you that Cenote Chaak-Tun is absolutely first rate and can confirm that it is quite close to Playacar and many of the resorts in the area. My wife and I were staying at Sandos Playacar and it was about a 15 minute taxi ride away. It won\u2019t be a particularly cheap experience ($20 USD each way for a cab and $30 each for the full experience), but my wife and I agreed that it was the most well spent money of our honeymoon.Our $30 got us wet suits, snorkels and masks, water shoes, underwater flash lights, and a 2 hour tour with only the two of us as guests. Our guide, Felipe, was a warm, friendly guy that had us laughing the entire way while pointing out the many things that make this cenote unique while giving us quite a bit of information about Mayan culture and how they viewed and used the cenotes. The guy is a pro\u2026 if you end up visiting, I highly recommend asking if he can take you on the tour. The cenote is quite large and we visited many chambers. We saw many stalactites and stalagmites, looked down underwater caves, saw fossils, spent a moment of silence in the dark, and had ourselves a little spa experience. It was truly MUCH more than just a visit to see a cenote. Additionally, they\u2019ve kept the grounds as natural as they can. Electric lighting and pathways are minimal, giving this cenote a much more natural, undisturbed feel than many others in the area. And the best thing\u2026 we were literally the only people in the water. It was so serene. There were other, larger groups we ran across, but Felipe told us that if you come by yourself from the hotel, you get the best experience.Additionally, there will be a photographer that finds you at various points on your tour. We had a go-pro and they had absolutely no problem with us taking our own pictures, but the low lighting made most of our pictures terrible. Their pictures, however, were fantastic and not too expensive when compared to other photography we were quoted while in the Rivera Maya. We were asked for 500 pesos for all of the fantastic pictures, but we didn\u2019t have enough left over after accounting for the cab ride home. We haven\u2019t done it yet, but we plan on purchasing them online.If there is one thing I could improve however, it would be the bathrooms. While they were adequate, they were quite \u201crustic\u201d and lacked a sufficient changing area for those who are shy. That, however, couldn\u2019t ruin our experience. Again, of all the things we did in the Rivera Maya, this would have to be my first recommendation to anyone visiting."

Chaak Tun is the closest cenote to Playa Del Carmen (15 minute drive) the taxi cost $150 to get there and when we arrived we were told it is not open for general exploring anymore so we had to pay 30USD per person for a tour. Luckily, the tour guide was great and we came at 2pm so were only sharing the place with 1 other couple. We also didn't plan on how to get home so our amazing tour guide, Eli, gave us a lift.

The price is totally worth the experience and is more than fair compared to other cenotes. I would recommend coming alone rather than with a tour. This way the tour guides dedicate their attention to giving you an unforgettable experience. I appreciated that Felix (tour guide) had a sense of humor as well as an understanding of the geology of the cenote, which he shared with us. We even used some of the finite sand to exfoliate our skin at the end! We also were privileged to have Augustina, their photographer, take great pictures of us through out the tour, which we were able to purchase at the end. This was one of the highlights of our trip and I definitely recommend visiting Chaak Tun!"

The staff were all friendly, informative, and helpful. I did not feel overwhelmed by the price of this tour for what we received. This was one of the best experiences our family had in Playa del Carmen. The were given all the equipment we needed (we had our own water shoes, and one snorkel and mask) which were life vests, 3 snorkels and masks. The staff made sure everything fit properly, and were told what to expect on our tour of the multiple cenotes. Our guide was Pancho. He was informative, and fun to listen to. He had historical stories for every area. He made sure we were safe, and comfortable along our entire tour. We were able to see bats, frogs, fish, and plenty of iguanas as well as the cave formations including stalagmites, and stalactites. Our guide was also able to explain some of the Maya history to us on our tour. This helped set our understanding for all the other historical data we would here while in the Yucatan. This was an excellent first experience snorkeling, and has opened our family up to diving in the future. Bring an underwater camera, or a cover for your phone for some awesome pics. Bring your own water shoes if you have them to avoid the bacteria from others, and don't bring to much you are not comfortable storing in a locker while your in the water."

Felipe was our guide and he was wonderful and patient. Very informative on the culture and cenotes The water is chilly \"refreshing\" and after 2 hours, I was cold, so if they offer a wet suit, take it, even in June. My only suggestion is to offer better flashlights because it would have been nice to see as good as Felipe did with his very strong light. You can touch these. This was a highlight and only 20 mins from our Puerto Aventuras hotel. Amazing!!!!"

            "review": "Awesome experience with a great guide!. We've been spending the end of our Mexico trip in Playa Del Carmen and found Cenote Chaak Tun as a nearby Cenote to explore. First thing to note is that it is not well heard of, even by the taxi drivers, so many didn't even know where to go! We got a map up on our phone to show the driver where it was - and all taxis from central PDC are about 200 pesos to get here (a bit steep in my opinion, but oh well).The awesome positive here is that it is so quiet and not busy, we practically had the entire cenote to ourselves.We did arrive very late, at about 3.15pm. The last organised tour leaves at 3.30pm but instead of catching it up, we were given our own private tour with Francisco who was 10/10 - an excellent tour guide with lots of info and clearly loves his job too.But seriously, the cenote was practically empty and completely silent - so wow! Loved it.All the other reviews below will clarify the specifics. We had originally read some out-of-date information that you can just hire snorkel gear and explore the cenotes yourselves, but this is no longer possible. The tour is 450 pesos per person. We tipped the guide as well, but it is a shame they ask so directly here in Mexico (everywhere!)It is quite far our and hard to get a taxi. I would recommend hiring a scooter/car to get around to these locations anyway."

            "review": "Journey to the depths of Xibalba. Hello Trippies,First let me explain the curious title of my review. According to the Mayan view of the universe and our very informative guide, Felix, Xibalba (pronounced, chi-bal-ba) is the name of the \"underworld\". And yes, under the world did we go.My girlfriend and I have been traveling to Mexico annually for more than 5 years. though we have not experienced every excursion, we have seen a few and are intent on seeing more. On this vacation we wanted to visit a cenote. A cenote is basically a sinkhole that reveals a fresh water expanse with some truly cool features. There are open cenotes and closed or underground cenotes and many variations in between. Cenote Chaak-Tun (pronounced, shock-toon) is a combination of these extremes, but our experience was mostly underground.The Chaak-Tun cenote is very accessible from the Playa del Carmen area. We were staying at the Iberostar Tucan and the cab ride to Chaak-Tun took about 15 minutes. We arrived and paid our fee of $USD30 per person, not bad. We were instructed to change into wetsuits as the water can be a bit cold. I've seen pictures of men and women swimming in Chaak-Tun with nothing more than trunks and a bikini... I would suggest you choose the wetsuit... lol. There are lockers available for your belongings. If you go, I would suggest taking a minimum of gear with you: thick-bottomed water shoes, waterproof camera, bathing suit (you wear this under the wetsuit), towel, money, ID. While you don't need a towel on the trek, it's good to have it available when you return.After we donned our wet apparel, we met in a central location. We went in the late afternoon so there were no crowds and only one other couple with us from Brazil. We were met by our guide for the next hour, Felix. Felix is extremely knowledgeable about the Mayan culture and the physical phenomenon of cenotes. His familial roots run deep in the Mayan culture and he is a ready resource for any questions you may have.Felix gave us a brief introduction to the Chaak-Tun cenote network and how cenotes are all over the Yucatan Peninsula. That said, we proceeded to the depths. But not before we were given snorkels and goggles; personal flashlights and \"required\" life preservers. Helmets are available, if you'd like, but we didn't need them.We walked down a stone staircase bordered by rickety hand rails made from a collection of thick vines or long tree trunks. The mouth of the entrance looks just like a mouth with sharp jagged teeth, the teeth being the stalactites hanging from the roof of the cenote. The staircase dissolves into the cold fresh water at the bottom... did I say \"cold\"... yes, it was cold. Upon first dip, your breath is taken away, but you do get used to it... the wetsuit reeeeeally helps... lol!Not only is the water a bit cold, it's also quite deep, hence the life preservers, which work very well. Felix led us through cavernous regions of the cenote. Some parts were quite tight. If you are claustrophobic, this may be a challenge for you, but have no fear, Felix is there. He will comfort you and get you through.Felix regaled us with his knowledge of the cenote/cave and it's strange structures: stalactites, stalagtites, fossils, etc. In some areas, there were bats hanging from the ceiling. Occasionally one would lose itself from its perch and flitter around, but it was no harm to us. There were a few fish, but not many.At just about the time I was getting a bit chilled by the water and all the cenote/cave recesses began to look the same, our tour came to an end (about 45 - 60 minutes). We took group and individual pictures using the photographer that followed us throughout our liquid journey. The pictures are offered as a souvenir at the end of the trek for a small fee of $USD30. I bought the CD; it was worth it. It also includes other cenote pics and imagery.We had a great time at Cenote Chaak-Tun and Felix is a fantastic and knowledgeable guide. Please tip them well.If you are thinking of doing this excursion, just jump in, the water is fine!"

Included in the entrancefee you got a locker, wetsuits, shoes and snorklemask. I would say our guide was the best, he made the whole experience worth it (his name was Felipe) and he took really good care of us. You could tell he loved his job, my girlfriend was a bit scared of the whole setting in the centoes and he made sure she got here time to get in the water, he also explain everything really well! It is a experience you should do if you are bored or if you dont feel like going to the beach! We had fun, learned alot about the mayan people and the creations inside the cenotes. The only thing i want to complain about is the price, you have to take a taxi (ca 400 pesos rt) and 450 per person to get in, and they also expect that you tip the guide before you leave! They have a girl who takes photos, (not good ones) and you get to buy them for 500pesos! Pricey but alot of fun."

Its very quiet and peaceful. This was something to see. I am 6 foot 4, and 270 pounds. There are some TIGHT areas. If you are claustrophobic, this might not be the tour for you.

There are a couple negative points, so we'll get those out of the way first. It's a little pricey compared to others in the area, and this almost led us to go somewhere else. And the bathrooms could DEFINITELY use some improvements. But the staff and the natural setting make up for it. A huge cruise group arrived right after us, so they let them get ahead of us so that my husband and I got a private tour. Felipe was our guide and he was incredibly knowledgeable and spoke English very well. My husband is a much more competent swimmer than I, so Felipe took him to a separate section of the cavern and took some pictures while I hung out with the bats. The whole place was so serene, peaceful like you can't even imagine. I am a little claustrophobic and not a great swimmer, so if you have similar concerns, please don't let this stop you from checking out this amazing place. The battery on our camera died as soon as we got there, so we paid the extra $30 for the pictures taken by Valentina, which were great, just a little pricey.

Because you go through very low-clearance areas and through tunnels, it really does need to be guided. THe cost was US$30 per person which is higher than other cenote entrance fees, but this includes the guide and equipment rental - wetsuit, snorkel, mask, and water shoes. They send a photographer with your group and offer to sell the photos to you for another US$30. This was probably the best cenote we went to along with Dos Ojos, which is close to Tulum."

Nice and cool - great reprieve from the hot sun.I booked through Viator and it was seamless. Walk ups are definitely a-ok, you just may need to wait."

We wanted to do something that would only take a couple of hours and then still have the rest of the day to ourselves back at the resort. We were told about many other cenote excursions that cost over $100 a person and would take all day to do so we stuck with our plan and booked the trip via Viator - so glad we did. Our transportation was suppose to pick us up at 1030am and didnt arrive until 11:15 ish so that was a little bummer but it worked out great because when we got to the cenote, we ended up being the only ones there for the next tour so it was just me, my boyfriend and the tour guide, Abel who was fantastic. He was so funny, honest and informative. I learned a lot and really appreciated his enthusiasm about the caves and the history. We really had a great time and felt like we had the entire place to ourselves. He really made our experience special and we felt like we had plenty of time to explore and swim around. This being my first cenote experience, I suppose this cave would be considered on the smaller side but we felt we got what we wanted out of the experience and really couldn't have asked for more. Next time I'd like to see an open cenote - this was a closed one and a beautiful one at that. I am a person who has a phobia of small, tight spaces and so there were some points in the trip that I was a little freaked out but Abel was encouraging and Im very very happy I kept on. I enjoyed it all. You really can't beat the price of this place either. $30 bucks a person for the tour and $30 bucks (total) for transportation - awesome and really glad we stuck with that."

When we arrived here, there were bathrooms with lockers and you could rent wet suits, snorkels/masks, and those shoes made of neoprene. They give you a hard hat to wear as you make your way into the cave and a life jacket. The water was cool, but you get used to it fairly quickly. The water is very deep at the point where you enter the water, but as you make your way through the cave, it gets shallower to the point where you can walk rather than swim. There are bats flying around you, so if you don't like bats, this may not be ideal. There are also small catfish swimming around."

Mine was the last tour of the day (3pm) so I was the only member of my group, a special and unexpected opportunity. Filipe was my tour guide, and he made the cenote come alive for me, a really magical tour. He is a former cave diver, very experienced with cenotes. He narrated for me the history of the cenotes, talking about geology, animal and plant life, and human history around the area. I have caving and snorkeling experience, so he was able to match the pace of the tour to my experience and abilities. The cenote was beautiful inside. We visited a number of different areas inside the cave system there, seeing lovely stalactite & stalagmite formations and a Mayan sweat lodge. The water was cool but I was warm enough in the wetsuit that was provided. It was fun to look underwater with the waterproof flashlight, also provided. The tour alternated between walking through water, swimming, and walking on land. I brought my own snorkel and mask, but these were included in the tour if needed. No flippers allowed. I did not come on an organized excursion, so I came by short taxi ride from Playa del Carmen. The cenote staff there was conscientious about finding me a taxi to take me back to town. Thank you, Felipe and the Chaak Tun staff!"

My boyfriend and I visited at around 10am a short cab ride away from Playa and bargained the ride down to 150 pesos taking in consideration he was also picking us up. Anyone got a cheaper ride than 150?? There is no cabs around there so arrange for your driver to wait or come back. We were the first ones and waited no longer than 15 minutes until people started arriving and got us ready for the tour. Our group was only 7 people and we were the only ones in the caves most of the time. They seem to space out their tours nicely. This is a huge reason why we decided to come here. To avoid crazy crowds or large tours. This was the first time visiting a cenote and I am happy we got to do it here with Felix as our guide. He gave us a lot of history and he was super funny so we had a blast! I am a little claustrophobic and the only moment I had to collect myself a bit is when I went under water for a couple of seconds to admire the underwater world. I am so glad I did. The awe and beauty made me forget all about my fears. I didn't once other than that felt nervous or uncomfortable. You don't go in any overly tight spaces it's actually very open and big. Federica, I truly hope I'm getting her name right! Was a doll. She followed us on the tour for pictures and they came out amazing!!! For about 400 pesos we took home about 60 pictures. We had a water camera and it was hard taking pics down there because it's dark so her pro pics are awesome! As many mentioned we were not pressured in to buying tequila and if you are not interested then just don\u2019t buy lol! Many mentioned how they were \u201cforced\u201d to buy. So all and all the park is one of the most affordable, stunning and fun! Heres the breakdown:Cost for 1 person: $450 pesos Includes: Water mask, water lamp, wetsuit, water shoes, and tour guide!Cab ride: $150 pesos one way.Photo CD: around $400 with 60+ pictures. (if you want it)Tip not included.***NOTE: This is a tour only Cenote great for snorkelers no diving. Although you can take off your jacket in the second cent to dive in a bit. Other cenotes charge an entrance about $200, equipment separately, and usually 500 for a guide per person."

My wife and I (not spring chickens -- I 72 and she 64) took this excursion in Cozumel off our Royal Caribbean cruise in April, and absolutely had a fabulous time and thoroughly enjoyed it. Upon departing the ship, we took a ferry about 30-40 minutes to Playa Del Carman and were met on the dock there by the guide (Eli). Can't say enough about his care of all of the people he was guiding. Just a couple of things that might make your trip a little more enjoyable, 1) if you have foot trouble, take an extra pair of sneakers that you can use in the caves. 2) If you can take an underwater camera for some underwater shots. Also, make sure that you take your towels, and a bag to carry all of your belongings. They provide water shoes, lifevests, and helmets where necessary. Be prepared to duck down almost in half in some of the spots to negotiate the paths. We certainly would recommend this excursion, not for its excitement, but for the beauty and history. At the end there was a very nice Mayan lunch (taco, tamale, rice, beans and a drink), and finally a tequila \"party\" on our excursion. I don' think that you can plan on the \"party\" as I understand they sometimes are not there. By the way the tequila was \"out of this world\". Hope you enjoy as much as we did if you give it a go."

What a wonderful surprise and so close to PDC. We took a taxi from the 5th Ave bus station and asked him to return for us, which he did, they can also call a taxi for you from the cenote. Alex was our guide, and in all my travels, have never enjoyed a guide so much!! He was very knowledgeable about the cenote, formations, the gases found in cenotes, just everything and more!!!!!! Almost a science lesson!! He is also of Mayan descent and we learned so much about Mayan culture, beliefs, some folklore stories as well as some of the language!!! The day we went we were the only 3 in the tour. They have bathroom/changing facilities, however bring snacks as none were available that day. We are in our upper 50s and very active, i believe this tour would be accessible to healthier older adults. You spend most of your time in the water, either snorkeling or walking in the water with some swimming. Beautiful above and below the water line! I highly recommend this tour!!!!! Pamela...

If you aren't interested in tequila or have kids you find yourself standing there with nothing to do and bored to tears. Our guide was great and the swimming was thrilling. The water really isn't too bad as we expected it to be colder. The formations were neat and the water was so clear. Like anything expect large groups of people which then cause you to be constantly ushered through things quicker than you'd like, but nevertheless it was still a great experience.

If you lose something, the guide should be able to retrieve it, but he won't guarantee it. Somebody lost the snorkel and Francisco was able to get it.Worth Checking the Cenote out if you are in Playa. It is a taxi ride away.

            "review": "A fascinating cenote near Playa. We went one afternoon on the recommendation of our concierge, as we didn't want to go really really far away. We got lost a bit getting there but ultimately found it. Not glitzy in appearance, it is led by a tour guide, you are furnished with (optional but useful) wet suit, the right wet/rock shoes, snorkel gear, obligatory life vests, and waterproof flashlight that ties to your wrist. The first part of the tour, which in our case had 12 people together (but it can be smaller, depending on who shows up when you do), took us to a fairly claustrophobic and initially intimidating cave pool, which however opened up after the opening passageway. Some people climbed down into the water, others splashed in. It's dark down there, but light enough to not be terrifying. We flopped around a bit, some swam further off than others. Many stalagmites and stalagtites and odd limestone formations. The second part led us to another cave, longer, the first part by foot and the second part, spectacular, with a hole in the ceiling where tree roots descended to the water, incense had been lit by the guide, in traditional Mayan form, he had us all recite a Mayan prayer to allow us in to the cavern. We stayed in the main pool area while the guide swam the crowd into the darker recesses, and we're glad we did, as the bats and birds, hearing no people, started their normal activities, flitting around from vine to vine and in the roof of the cavern. It was breathtaking and beautiful, a cacophony of natural sounds, calls, and just us paddling softly in the dark blue water. Memorable. Two hours, not cheap, but worth it."

However, there were plenty of options here to suit us all. Husband & I went for the self guided option as we were short of time & needed to be able to attend to baby if required - 300 pesos for snorkel & torch, and it allowed swimming in first cenote and we were able to walk and look at second. Grandparents paid 200 pesos to look at both cenote and watch baby. They were able to sit near the waters edge so we could easily get to baby if need be. There are of course some steep rocky access steps but we all managed fine. We had the first cenote to ourselves which was really cool. Quite dark and enclosed so not for those who feel claustrophobic. Great being able to look at the second cenote even though we couldn't swim in it alone. There were plenty people here on the guided tour, think that was 500 pesos for 2 hours.We later visited Dos Ojos which may be a bigger and more interesting cenote but is much busier. I suppose the cool thing about the cenotes is how different they all are. The highlight for us at Chaak Tun was having it to ourselves. Worth a visit."

We were given all the necessary gear and safety equipment to snorkel through the caves. Wet suits are available if you wish, although most of us went in our bathing suits. The formations of stalactites and underwater stalagmites were spectacular. There are lots of bats and spiders (although safely tucked into niches!). If you have claustrophobia this is not the place for you as it is quite dark and confined in places, but I felt very safe and secure throughout the tour.

Of the 15+ cenotes we have visited I would put it in the top three for beauty and number one for service and value. We arrived via taxi at 2:30pm and received our gear - light, snorkel, and mask. We declined wet suits and were glad we did as the cenote was cool but refreshing for us. The only thing missing was a towel, wish we would have brought one as we were having dinner in Playa del Carmen afterwards. The guide started off in a mixed wet/dry cave area with a photographer of which I sadly declined since I figured we'd get some stock photos afterwards. He explained how cenotes came about, some of the history of the one we were visiting, and how they continue to work. He was very information and fluent in both English and Spanish. Next we visited a beautiful cave area that had both a large open cavern and smaller sections with just enough room to fit between the stalactites and stalagmites. What was especially nice is there was a rope along the larger sections so you could choose to hang on to that and still see most of the cave and water sections without having to swim or go through too many tight spots. We of course choose to go through some of the smaller sections as the guide offered us a choice for how much to do, and said he did so for every group. The water was crystal clear with light blue shining across the deep caverns and underwater stalagmites. It is like floating through another world since the water is brackish (fresh and salt water mix) and filled with minerals. Underneath we could tell the caves went on for quite a ways. There were some small zebra fish, catfish, and turtles in the cenote as well. One section we swam through required walking through a short dry cave section to get back to the beginning and they had it lit up in red and blue - nice touch!!The second cenote was a vast cavern with just a few offshoots of tunnels. We were given free time to check out all the formations, float around and stare at the bats on the ceiling, or just relax in the huge natural pool. The guides and staff were so great and at only $30 entrance fee with equipment per person, quite a steal compared to other deals in the area. Total visit time is about 2 - 2 1/4 hours depending on how long it takes to get geared up and ready to go."

We booked it through the cruise because of the length of the trip and we didn't want to get left behind, which was a really good thing we did because we were about 45 minutes late getting back to Cozumel. You do have to take a ferry from the island over to the mainland but we were easily guided to the ferry once we left the ship. Unfortunately, we were experiencing some bad weather the day of the trip (a few cruise ships decided not to dock that day). We soon sort of regretted that our captain got us docked- we had a very bumpy and crazy ferry ride. They handed out some sea sickness pills and barf bags as we boarded. None of us had ever experienced sea sickness before but the 3 of us barely made it without getting completely sick. Several passengers did throw up on the trip.The tour itself was great. Our guides were great. Very pleasant and knowledgeable. We took a short bumpy van ride over to the caves. They provided water shoes, masks, and snorkels. You don't need the mask and snorkel. The water is crystal clear and no need to go underwater. We were allowed to keep our cameras with us and we got some really great shots. They also took two photos for us and were selling them for $20 I think. During the tour, we did some of it with life jackets on but were allowed to take them off later in the tour. We actually found it much easier to move around though with the life jackets on. There weren't really any tight spaces to go through so no worries there. The water is cool but was actually very refreshing. After the swim in the cave, they brought us over to a real Mexican lunch in one of the other caverns. It was very good. After lunch they did a short Tequila tasting of some organic tequila. It was good, but expensive. After all of this we were taken back in to Playa Del Carmen to shop for a couple hours. We are not shoppers though and didn't enjoy this part of the trip. The merchants are pushy, friendly, but pushy. I think a good improvement for the tour would be to make the shopping optional. We had a 14 year old with us that just complained about wanting to get back to the ship."

The view was amazing and these Cenotes goes under ground all the way out to the gulf. They had underwater lights and a guide to keep you from going were you should not. The after effect was very refreshing."

It was 450 pesos per person for a guide, wetsuit, torch and entrance. We saw bats, catfish (only little ones) and we swam around the caves enjoying crystal clear water and plenty of pretty rock formations. The depths of the caves stretched off in some areas and I could undertand the appeal of cenote diving. The taxi driver waited for us and we paid him the same to get back. It is possible to get a collectivo most of the way if you wanted to save more money."

Our guide Felix was excellent with a thorough knowledge and respect for the cenote. The cenote as others have noted is spectacular the two hour tour takes you through the cenote for 450 pesos plus well deserved tip for the guide is well worth the expense.(200 peso cab ride each way). See it before it becomes commercialized."

Our guide Abl also was knowledgable and made us feel like we were going to parts unknown. ( of course we weren't but it felt like it). Sunday was an awesome day to go as it was not busy.

The caves are mostly underground and with flashlights and if you're a good swimmer in some parts to can see 30/40/50 meters away, just breathtaking!!! The water is so clear and it's really well done, don't go commercial, just get a taxi there from main square in playa! It's about 6 or 7ks away from there"

He took us all through the underground river and showed us the stalactites, and explained how they form. We had snorkeling gear, and wet suits were available. I didn't wear a wet suit, but was fine until the very end when I got a bit chilly. He took us into one place where if you went underwater and looked ahead it showed just how long the caves go!! There was a girl taking pictures along the tour and they were available for a fee. That was a bit pricy too... $30US for all (60) the pictures or $20 for 4. There was a tequila tasting afterwards and that guy was really fun! Would definitely recommend this place if you're going to do a cenote since it has a great tour and it was an incredible experience!"

After pulling into the parking lot at Rio Secreto and realizing they wanted $75US per person for a tour, we googled the next closest cenote which happened to be Chaak Tun. It's a little off the beaten track and we were actually a little nervous driving there, but once you get there, there are at least bathrooms and lockers. Our timing turned out to be just right, and my husband and I ended up getting a private tour with Felipe. He told us of how he was a trained cave diver and he knew so much about the cenote, the history of the Riviera Maya and had great tips on what to do and where to go. We snorkeled through the caves and Felipe expertly called our attention to fossils, bats, wildlife and other cool sights that we would have missed had we not had a guide. The one-on-one experience was top-notch, and I'd highly recommend having Felipe lead you through the Chaak Tun cenote if you have the chance. For the rest of the trip, we found ourselves saying \"well, Felipe told us...!\" Also, the cenote itself is beautiful. It's cool and you need the wetsuit, but the water is clear, the lighting is perfect and there is so much beauty to see both above the water and below. If you only have time for one cenote tour, I'd go with this one. Also, we didn't pay extra for the photo package but if I could go back I might have done that as we had trouble getting shots on our iphones that captured the true beauty of the place."

They provide a wetsuit, flashlight and a great guide, although a tip of between 100 to 200 pesos is appropriate for him. A pleasant surprise was that the road is paved all the way out to Chaak Tun now. You will see some painted rocks on the right side of the road on the ground with letters about one foot high that spell out Chaak Tun. If you're driving, slow way down since you will be turning right on a blind curve into the parking lot shortly after you see those rock letters.We didn't do the tequila tasting. From reading other reviews I thought there would be a restaurant onsite, although I understand now that cruise ship tourists are taken to a restaurant in the area as part of their excursion to Chaak Tun. This is a good rainy-day activity since you'll be underground most of the time. Above ground there are also covered areas to hang out in if it's raining. If you can choose the time of day to go, afternoon is best since all the cruise ship tourist groups come in the morning and the afternoon is much less crowded. Closing time is around 4:30 pm."

I was nervous it wouldn't go well because it was a smaller place and we were the only ones there, but they proved me wrong! The tour is two hours and $30 per person. The guide will take you to two separate entrances to swim in. They also provide you with flashlights, snorkel masks, wet shoes, and a wet suit if wanted. The cenote is very well lit. The girls who work there will follow you around and take pictures at certain spots, as well as candid pictures. At the end you can buy the entire CD of pictures for $30. Great price! Our guide, Abel, was excellent. It was his day off and he still took us out! He was constantly making sure we were comfortable and safe. I would suggest going when it is less busy because you will get a more personalized experience of some of the smaller areas of the cenote (if you are a good enough swimmer to go without a life vest). Overall, it far exceeded my expectations. Great experience for a great price. I would highly recommend going here!"

You are provided with a locker, water shoes, snorkel and wet suit (if desired) and enter into the cenote where you're surrounded by stalactites and stalagmites and get to swim/snorkel for quite some time.

They accept only pesos so bring enough to tip guide as well. The time is about 2 hour trip. They have all equipment but you can bring water shoes and definitely a change of clothes. They have lockers and bathrooms."

It seemed safe, well organized (even with a photographer to record our journey), and commercial in a pleasant, low key manner (unlike much about the raging commercialism of Playa). Best of all was our guide who was a delightful man with great English (he lived in California for a period) and a real desire to inform."

Arrange for the cab driver to pick you back up at the end of the tour as there are not cabs waiting at the park.I thought that the 30 dollar entrance fee was well worth it. It includes a locker, guided tour, wetsuit, and snorkeling equipment. The caves are very interesting since they have stalactites and other formations. The water is very clear. The guide was very friendly and professional. Not strenuous. One of the coolest things we did in Playa."

We toured two wet cenotes and one dry one. Our guide was very helpful with our disabled son, who snorkeled for the first time. The water is cool and refreshing and crystal clear. There is a rope in the water to follow so you can't get lost. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the history of the area and made the experience very enjoyable. There is an abundance of marine life, including turtles about the size of a dinner plate. My daughter was thrilled to be able to hold one! At the end of our experience we enjoyed hot cheese empanadas with a spicy salsa. Very tasty. I would definitely recommend this experience to anyone!"

            "review": "Extraordinary cenote very near Playa. We took a taxi ride to this spot down a dirt road just outside the town of Playa del Carmen. We arrived around 11 and we seemed to have missed the cruise crowds. If you can get there earlier I'm sure it'd be better but we were fine. It is very well organized once you walk up to the front desk. Everything is explained in English and we were told that after we changed in the changing rooms we would be met by our guide. Pancho was our very informed and enthusiastic guide for this incredible experience. My husband is not a strong swimmer and feels uncomfortable in deep waters but or guide Pancho kept him near by his side to explain to him the upcoming underwater terrain. We learned so much about Mayan history and culture as well as how this marvelous geological creation was formed. If you are visiting the area you will notice there are dozens of cenotes to visit and if I had the time I would go to every singe one. I did visit another cenote that I read about and as soon as I reached the other cenote I appreciated the service at Chaak Tun, especially Pancho. There are certain items that can be rented that will make your visit here a bit more exceptional. All of these extras do add up and I will explain which ones you will need. If you have your own snorkeling mask and tube bring them to avoid that rental, also you can bring your own water shoes. They sell them at the Walmart within walking distance to the 5th Avenue for less than the cost of the rental at Chaak Tun. One item that is worth consideration are the wet suits. If you get cold easily get the wet suit, it makes the whole tour and underwater cave exploration very comfortable. If you keep moving and can handle a bit of cool water you won't need the wet suit. If you are unsure just get the wet suit. Another aspect of visiting this cenote are the photographers that will take pictures of you and your family. I was a little annoyed at first by the paparazzi, that is until I saw the pictures at the end of our visit. Well I never buy pictures at tourist attractions, but this was my surprising exception. I bought the disk with almost 30 images of my partner and I for $450 pesos. For all those great pictures it was well worth it when you convert your currency.The only issue I would bring up to the photographers would be to change their use of disks. We came home and realized we didn't have any disk drives on our computers. My partner is going to have to take the disk to work and put the photos on a thumb drive. I wonder if the photographers at Chaak Tun might consider an upgrade of their equipment."

Be sure to arrange with the taxi driver to come back and pick you up. Ask the price before you get in. The tour was 2 hours so we told him 2 1/2 but I'd wished we said 3 because there is a small tequila seller there and we enjoyed tasting and chatting with him, but were a little rushed at the end, because our taxi arrived.we arrived at 8:30 am and they opened at 9. We got some pictures of spider monkeys while we waited. I recommend going early, we had the place to ourselves.Or guide was Phillipe, and he was wonderful, took his time and was very knowledgeable about the area, and plants as well. I have seen me fri nods coming and I intend to return with them for another swim. The only thing I would do different is I'm going to look for my own waterproof flashlight, they only want to give you one for every two people and one of ours was very dim. Also do not bring a lot of stuff with you, the lockers are not very big and they want you to share a locker between two people. The cost at the gate was $30 and included locker/lock, water shoes, a wetsuit, lifejacket, shared flashlight, mask, and snorkel. They have packages of photos available at the end but we did not buy those. So bring extra cash if you feel you might want that."

We took our kids (6 & 8) but they are both good swimmers.This trip wouldn't be suitable for those who have difficulty walking on rough terrain, or who are not comfortable in water. Water temp is a constant 23C - about 6C cooler than your local swimming pool, but it's fine with the wetsuit.Take a tip for your guide."

We paid the driver 500 return.It was us and another couple together with our guide Abel who made this experience a fabulous one. The staff here work solely voluntarily so an extra tip is in right place but optional of course. For us it was easy to tip because Abel was really professional giving us a lot of information while swimming and helping me out when I got a bit claustrophobic. If you want to experience a cenote basically on your own with professional guides this is the place to go.

Entry fee was USD 30 per person, which is quite expensive compared to other Cenotes. However, the visit also takes longer (1-2 hours) and includes a guide. Our private guide Abel was very friendly and as we travelled with 4 adults and 2 small kids (3 months and 2 years) he took the time and showed the place first to two of us and thereafter to the others. The Cenotes are beautiful and you need a guide to show you the various chambers via the water. If it wasn't for the price, I would have rated it 5 out of 5.Taxi from playa del Carmen city centre (ca15mins) costed us 150 pesos (one-way); best to agree with the driver to pick you up afterwards as the place is not frequented by a lot of taxis. Be mindful of the large groups of cruise passengers that visit, it can get a bit crowded so better visit early."

They basically advertise a cost per cave. Pay this much if you want to see this (with pictures on wall) and this much if you want to see bats too. The people running Chaak Tun have a flat rate (was about $30 US when converted) to explore everything WITH all gear included AND tour guide. Abel was our guide and he was GREAT. My daughter is 9 and took quite a while to get her little butt in the freezing water. He was super patient. He also took us on our own instead of with another group coming in because he knew we were in a hurry to make the ferry back on time. Super accommodating place and a BEAUTIFUL, serene chunk of nature here :). I asked the photographer not to come since we had our own water camera. My suggestion is NOT to do this as it is sooooo beautiful, you won't want to risk it trying to play photographer while your exploring up to your chin in the water!! Plus it's non obligatory, so if you don't like the pictures you don't have to buy it. My guess is that CD is negotiable in price, too, since everything else in Mexico seems to be. I do wish the place had more wetsuits. Mine was huge on me (I'm super petite in their defense) and they had none for children :(. They also didn't give my child a flashlight (children probably drop them in the water so I get it) so she was a bit bummed about that. I took the advice from others on here about it being really busy in the morning so we went around 2 and it was empty. Thanks Chaak Tun!!!"

Entrance to the caves is 450 pesos, for which you get mask, snorkel, wetsuit and one dive light per couple. Ask for an extra light as this will make your experience much better. The first cave is ok, but nothing to get excited about but the second and larger cave is awesome. You swim through narrow caves and explore the whole system. Recommended"

Bats were flying in and out and I managed to capture some using slow motion on the camera. The water was cool, but not \"shocking\". An easy walk to each destination. Even though it's a snorkeling adventure, the rock formations and surroundings are equally enthralling. Definitely a must see! We spent time on the beach afterward and had a delicious Mexican meal and shopped for local gifts. You could easily spend all day here but 3 to 4 hours will work as well (not including travel)."

We chose Chaak Tun over other Cenotes in the area b/c we wanted something close enough to PDC that our 3yo wouldn't go crazy in the car ride. A short taxi ride later and we started one of the best adventures we've ever had. The pools are clean, clear and surreal. The water temperature is great, though in hindsight, I would recommend using a wet suit b/c of the total leangths of the tour (2 hours). The photographers really know their venue and take great pictures so make sure to budget and extra $30 for the CD at the end of the trip. Our guide, Rico was personalble, knowledgable and fun to talk with Highly recommend for families visiting the PDC/ Tulum area."

Our guide was Abel, and he was wonderful. He explained to us the cultural significance of cenotes to the Maya and a little about their rituals. He led us through, giving us just the right amounts of time in various locations, and wowing us a bit when time allowed. We booked this as part of an excursion with our cruise ship, so admission, locker, lunch, and transportation were all included in the cost. They had flashlights for us to use, snorkeling masks for those who wanted them (we didn't take one and missed out on seeing some of the cool underwater things). Even lunch was served in one of the caves, and it was very very good.I brought my wetsuit from home and was very comfortable. The water is in the low 60s (Farenheit), and being a Florida girl who is a wimp about the cold, I was very glad to have a wetsuit. My husband didn't use a wetsuit, just a rash guard, and he didn't complain about the cold after the initial shock of getting in the first time. But if you already have one, I'd recommend bringing it."

We were in a small group of 5 which was ideal and the guide, Ricardo, was funny and informative. He spoke perfect english and was very passionate about the history and preservation of these sites. It was a great introduction to the caves, as the next stop we went we were scuba diving them so it made me very excited!

You have to drive down an unnamed street by a shantytown to get to it so you might wonder if you're going the right direction initally. Once you get there it's a simple set up. For around $30 you get a wet suit, booties and a 2 hour tour of 3 or 4 cenotes. We went in a group of 5 people with Ricardo - very knowledgeable, entertaining, and accomodating. I wish they had gloves because some of the formations that you swim by are very sharp/rough and I nicked my knuckles a few times. I'm over 6' and some of the passages I swam through were pretty tight. The water was cool, but I chose not to use a wetsuit and didn't mind at all, it was actually very nice compared to the 80F @ 100% humidity outside! I would really suggest getting your own flashlight (not sharing) because it can be cramped occasionally and you might bump your head against stalagtites if you can't see them - no joke! It can also get a little disorienting down there in the darkness. Other than that, I highly recommend this trip. Very cool!!"

First, I want to mention it was a short, easy drive west and away from the beaches from Playa Del Carmen. We had a rental car which made it easy to get there and parking is free. We paid $30 per person and that included a wet suit (much needed...water in the cave was cool), a mask, snorkel, water shoes, one flashlight per couple, and a guide (Mario). What a great time we had! A little walking and much more snorkeling in the pools within the caves was awesome! Mario really made us all feel completely unrushed and relaxed.

The cenote is beautiful and awe inspiring. If you are comfortable swimming around in a dark cave, don't miss this one. The water is cold but they supply you with a wet suit, so its ok. The entire staff does their best to give you a wonderful tour. Everyone speaks English, so if that's important to you, don't worry."

I googled this location trying to experience the infamous caverns of the Yucatan peninsula.We, myself & a friend, arrived and were blown away.We paired up with our guide, Felix who cared about nothing else but costumer satisfaction. His overwhelming love for the area was an added inspiration. He even took us somewhere we hadn't been before as he asked us if we were interested and his enthusiasm was impossible to ignore! A super loose, fun & great guy!The staff manager made us realize why the place runs so well too, his relationship with his employees is amazing. The place is chill, people are relaxed and there are no strict rules as to ruin your experience.The staff seem to care more about your experience in Chaak Tun than the money which is what made us tip them more!Chaak Tun itself is a experience you mustn't miss!We highly recommend it!"

Never felt like we had to \"move along\" to the next spot. The water was a bit murky in spots but still easy to see the underwater caves, and stalagmites.

Most of the Cenotes you'll see in photos are underground watering holes where you can admire the beauty but you just kind of swim around in one place. But this one being so different is one of the things we loved.This cenote is more of an underground cave tour where you get to swim. There are parts with tight spaces, low ceilings and cold water. This felt like a mini-adventure and less like a tourist attraction which is what we were really looking for.The only \"bad\" thing is that your photos will not turn out too great if you don't have a good flash. There is a photographer who takes a few photos which you can buy at the end. But the sights you'll see with the flashlights they provide is well worth the price of 350 pesos per person.And to top it all off the guide, Ricardo, was amazing. Funny, insightful and made sure we all appreciated everything."

This isn't a free swim deal, you have to take a tour of the caves with a guide for US$30 per person. Totally worth it! Our guide was Ricardo, and he was very knowledgeable and spoke perfect English.

We really wanted to experience a Cenote and were torn between a couple different options that we found. We found Cenote Chaak Tun to be a great value and bring in the great experiences of snorkeling in a cenote as well as the experience of going into an underground river (we had looked at Rio Secreto and several other cenote excursions). We took a cab from the cab stand on Constituyentes, they told us it would be 200 pesos for one way, 600 pesos for the round trip and the cab driver would wait for us at the entrance and we could leave whenever we wanted. This was different from the $35 that the cab driver at our hotel told us. He did not say anything about round trip so we assumed it was one-way. Definitely verify that before you go. You're going to want the driver to wait for you as it is way out there and nowhere near a main road. The front desk might be able to help you call for one, but who knows how long that would take.Admission was $30 (we had read online somewhere that it was $10 but that was older). That includes a mask, water shoes, wet suit, lifejacket, flashlight and helmet. A tour guide also comes with that. We had Felix who was great. He was very knowledgeable about the cenote, the history of the Yucatan peninsula and the Mayan influence. You can definitely tell that exploring caves is a huge passion of his.The tour part of the exploration is about an hour and a half. It's so surreal and I definitely recommend anyone that has the chance to go there.They take pictures throughout the tour and offer to sell you a video set to music at the end. We did not have any cash left on us at this point, but I don't remember it being that unreasonable, especially compared to the more mainstream tourist stops. Plus you can't really take any decent pictures of your own in the cenote.I will definitely be recommending this to anyone I speak to who is going to PDC."

We booked our tour through the Viator site connected here. I think $30 was so incredibly reasonable. The roundtrip hotel ride offerred by the tour company is extra. We decided to take a taxi. We paid $15 USD to get there and agreed to pay the same if he returned in about 2 hours. There was a large cruise ship tour group ahead of us so we waited until they left and to see if anyone else showed. We were really lucky because it was just us and Abel. I was excited to find out Abel would be our guide as I had read many nice reviews about him. They were all true! Abel spoke perfect English and made us feel very at ease in the cenotes. You can tell he loves his job and has a lot of respect for the history and nature of the cenote. Be sure to bring cash for a generous tip as he advised us he is working as a volunteer dependent on tips. You can bring towels, a bag, shoes or whatever you need because they do provide a padlock /key for the lockers at the entrance. I didn't realize that so I had a waterproof wallet. I chickened out about my waterproof case for my iphone and I'm glad because it really allowed for me to enjoy the cenote without trying to take a million pics. The tour sends a photographer to key spots to take photos of your party, and IMO the price of the disc (about $30) was reasonable. We bought it :) There was another option to buy 4 photos that they print for you on the spot. The park provides you with vests, waterproof flashlight, mask and aqua shoes. The \"scary\" factor is there just a little. I don't think my kids would have enjoyed it...it's dark, cold water, and there are a few bats flying around. To me, that was awesome. I know bats don't bother us, but still could see some of the kids on the passing tour not loving it. I'd say 8-9 years minimum. There are a few spots that we had to duck under a rock and Abel helped guide us. That was a little odd feeling to be swimming under a dark rock, but pretty exhilarating! My husband and I were SO glad we did this. It's a truly remarkable, unique experience. We were grinning ear to ear, just not believing how cool it was the whole time.* One note I want to mention about Explora tours....a big thank you to them. Once I was home, i realized I must have inadvertently thrown out my photo disc. I got ahold of them by phone and they got my info (I saved my receipt and sent a pic of it) -- they were in contact with me to email me the photos I thought I had lost forever. I can't say THANK YOU enough!"

We took a cab there because we could not find any public transportation that went to Chaak Tun. It was not a very expensive cab ride and only took about 15 minutes. It cost about $30 USD to do the tour per person. Water shoes, life vests (if wanted), a waterproof flashlight, wet suits( if wanted, I recommend this because after 2 hours in the water it got very cold), and helmets (if wanted) were provided in addition to the tour. I also recommend bringing cash because you are in the middle of the jungle and the WiFi is not strong with the credit card machine. Our tour guide, Abel, was incredible. He did the tour both in Spanish and English. He was informative, funny, and showed us such a good tour. You get to explore 2 different caves while on this tour and you learn a bit about Mayan culture. The caves are filled with stalactites and stalagmites and it makes you feel like you are in the depths of the earth. The flashlights allow you to see in the dark caves as well as into the depths under water which can be hundreds of feet deep! In the second cave, you get to sit in a shallow portion and rub the sand on your skin, like the Mayans did to look younger. Abel told us that the sheen on oil we were seeing on the water was from people wearing sunscreen in the water, which he explained was very bad for the environment. So I recommend refraining from wearing it. You're under ground so you won't need it. This was such an unbelievable, cool site. It's hard to put into words what it was like. You should just go experience it for yourself! I only wish we could have gotten a little more Mayan history with the tour."

We took our tour in Spanish because the group was smaller than the one in English. They provided wetsuits, masks and flashlights. Freddy, our tour guide was extremely good. I was very scare at the beginning. I went there with my husband and my 2 sons, ages 10 and 6. Freddy told me to be calm, and he assured me this place was very safe for all of us. At the end of our tour, I couldn't be happier I made it. This place is like out of a movie. Freddy gave us a ton of great information about this amazing cenote. We never felt unsafe there, and we really had fun appreciating the wonders that nature put in this place. The surroundings are clean and they make emphasis in keeping it as natural as it can be. No big constructions, just a place to get your equipment, restrooms, and the jungle. Something you will appreciate is that they have a photographer on site. Our photographer was Federica and she got very nice shots from our tour. At the end, you are able to get your pictures cd for only $40 (good deal if I compare with a $30 picture I got at the dolphin thing at Wet-n-Wild in Cancun 4 years ago) the pictures have a decent resolution and it is a great option if you don't have a waterproof camera with you. Again, this place is a must if you visit this area. Freddy and Federica were great."

We took the tour with Abel and he could not have done anymore to make our experience better! Abel was sure to make everyone comfortable and not only explained things about the cenote but also talked briefly about the Mayan culture, which happened to be beneficial in the long run. Also, some professional pictures where taken which we didn't think we would buy but was actually a great purchase because you not only get great pictures of your family or friends (can I hear Christmas cards) but they also had some amazing extra pictures of the cenote that only a pro could take! This definitely was one of the best stops we made! Don't forget when you go to ask for Abel!!! He will make the whole experience that much more unforgettable!!!"

            "review": "Great activity- strongly recommend. . My friend and I decided to visit Cenote Chaak Tun (Wednesday 5 August) after having read previous reviews on Trip Advisor and weren't disappointed. We were extremely lucky in the sense that we had only 2 others in our group and so were taken into some smaller spaces that we might not have been able to experience in a bigger group. I have a fear of open water and fish, and my friend isn't great in small spaces but we were made to fee at ease the whole time, and looked after very well by Abel who was fab. There's so much to see, and with so many stalactites and stalagmites to dodge- there wasn't any time to worry about the fish (which were very few and down at the bottom of the cave) after too long! While life jackets are advised, my friend and I are comfortable enough swimmers and so didn't need to take it- which helped when navigating the small spaces! But if you're not great or tire easily, I'd definitely advise taking one. We got a taxi from the bus station for 150 pesos but unfortunately he didn't come back for us as promised. The man at the desk however was very friendly and helpful, and called us a taxi- which cost us 200 pesos this time. We were just glad to get back so didn't bother contesting the price!Such a fab experience, definitely a must. If I went back, I'd take goggles as opposed to the snorkel mask- just a personal preference as I like to breathe out of my nose when underwater. Watch the bats- there are loads, but they're harmless and really fun to watch!"

            "review": "Worth a few hours, particularly if you need a break from the heat/sun!. I did a lot of research before my boyfriend and I (both in our mid-30s) arrived in Playa and I read about this cenote and planned to go. We ended up not visiting it until our last day of an 8 day trip, but we were very glad we did. This and our whale shark tour were the highlights of our vacation. It was particularly well-timed for us because my boyfriend was really done with all of the heat and sun of our late-July trip and wasn't up for another full day in the sun.We scouted it out a few days earlier when we had a rental car and decided to just take a taxi back on another day, from our hotel (The Royal, right on Avenida Quinta). We were quoted 200 pesos each direction. I probably could have talked it down a bit but didn't feel like it. When we got to the cenote, which as many say is just 15-20 mins from downtown Playa at the end of Benito Juarez (good thing to know because a lot of locals are still unaware of this cenote, including taxi drivers), I asked if he would return or stay. He said 500 pesos total and he would just wait for us, so that's what we did.I'm not sure what a few other reviews are saying about not needing a guide, but yes, this is a guided cenote only. And it is 360 pesos per person, including any equipment you may want. We only used water shoes, masks, and a flashlight. The water was refreshingly cold to us, but there was a child (about 9 yrs old) in another group and I think one of the adults, that were very cold and ended up stopping early because of it. We did not use life-jackets even though the guy at the front desk said they were required in the first cavern. Our guide asked us if we were good swimmers and when we said yes, he gave us the option. I do not recommend going without a life jacket unless you are comfortable treading water for about 30-40 minutes with few breaks. You can't really SWIM so really think about whether you want to tread water. I was fine but it did definitely get tiring. I just figured it was good exercise since I hadn't gotten any on my trip!I was kicking myself for not bringing a waterproof camera. No, you can not bring anything that can't get wet so if you don't have your own, the only option is the $20 for the CD they make you, that only has about 10-15 pictures of you and then a whole bunch of filler stock pictures of the caverns and animals. There was one really nice picture of us so $20 was worth it to me.INTERESTING FEEDBACK:We were originally told we would join a group of two families and there would be one guide with 9 guests (they limit the groups at 12). Then we were suddenly told that a different guide was going to take just the two of us. This sounded great to us, but it turns out, he was brand new (only worked 4 days there) and didn't know ANYTHING about the cavern, rocks, geology, or even which areas of the cavern we could go to. He tried really hard and was very nice, and in some ways, I wouldn't trade it for the alternate experience because it was very quiet and peaceful at times with just the three of us, but that is definitely not the typical experience. When we overlapped with the original group we were added to, we listened to their guide for about 10 minutes and found out that he is EXTREMELY knowledgeable. So, just be aware that if you want to learn about the cavern, make sure to ask for a knowledgeable guide. I have a fair amount of knowledge about cave formation and rock formation so I was actually teaching our guide things at times I think.Sorry for the long review but I felt I had some good info and I know that is what I am always looking for! We went on a Saturday around 12:30 at the end of July and didn't have to wait at all. I really recommend going if you have some time and just want a few hours of something different."

            "review": "Nice cenote, but tour required for tourists.. This was a nice experience. Great cenote very close to downtown Playa and it is not well known. Most folks visiting when we were there were locals. The tour itself is nice and the cenote is very refreshing. We had a great time and the guide was excellent. So why the 2 stars? For being duped into paying for a tour. I've read several reviews (including some from earlier this year) indicating you pay an entrance fee and can rent gear, but are not required to purchase the tour. The place was fairly empty when we went and it was on a Sunday. The guy at the entrance said a tour was required and it was this way since at least 4 years back. I made the mistake of saying we were visiting from LA. I finally agreed after haggling the price down to $250 from $360 pesos per person. I wasn't going to put a damper on our day and let the family down. The price is not bad, but considering a family of 8, it adds up. Especially when you're going in expecting to pay far less, and paying for a couple of taxis to and fro. To top it off, all other groups of people (with the exception of another tourist group) we ran into roaming the grounds were on their own. I didn't bother to bring it up to the guy in charge as my family was having fun.Again, this is a nice cenote. Just be prepared to pay $16-23 USD per person. Other cenotes along Hwy 307 are about $4-6 USD. I always pay in pesos when in Mexico. The estimates are at the going conversion of about 15.5 to 1 USD. You obviously pay more if paying in USD."

We knew the price beforehand (360 pesos) and though expensive, it was a fantastic experience. Something we would not be able to rival in England for 20 pounds. Our guide was Abel, as Spanish speakers we joined a Spanish group for the first half of the tour and were left to our own devices for the second part, swimming with one other family. Abel was very patient and kind and gave lots of reassurance to my girlfriend who is not an experienced swimmer. Though photos we purchased look good however I should have haggled over the price. I'd definitely reccommend this, it lasts at least 90 minutes and if you haven't had the opportunity to swim in a cave with bats and catfish then go for it. If you've been to similar cenotes already then maybe give it a miss."

The price was $150MX to the Cenote and took 10 minutes. I asked the driver to come back for us (volver) in 2.5 hours. He charged the same price to get back to town. He was waiting for us at the front desk after our visit. He was a very affable chap. I would not recommend walking it. Cycling would be a possibility with plenty of water.The actual tour costs $360MX per person. This includes a guide, waterproof torch, use of life jacket, helmet, snorkel/mask, water shoes and wetsuit. There are toilets, changing area and locker with padlock (no cost) The water is cold but not, in my opinion, too cold for a suit. We took our own dive shoes and snorkel/mask. You get used to the template after a couple minutes.Our guide's name was Felix and he was outstanding. He was friendly, knowledgeable and caring. First of all, he let my wife and I have some time in a cave to get used to the water and our surroundings. It was brilliant. There were a few little catfish roaming around our feet and one or two bats seeking out lunch with their sonar skills. This cave was big enough to stand up and swim (2/3 metres water depth and 10 metres long/3 metres wide).oFelix returned to take us on our Indiana Jones-esque adventure. He explained to us about the Mayan traditions and the importance of nature and the cenotes to their culture.He then led us to the main cave and showed us all his favourite nooks and crannies. The information about the geology of the cenote was excellent. He justified everything with technical knowledge of minerals.<It takes 100 years for a stalactite to 'grow' 2cm.>I asked a few questions - Felix had an answer for them all.Highlights were the beauty below the water and the sound of the bats flying past your head, forming a miniature gust of wind.I'd recommend taking a waterproof camera. We have read on this that it is busy in the morning. We went on a Monday (beginning of August) arriving at 1130am and we had the place to ourselves, with our own amazing guide.Any questions and I'll happily reply."

We ended up just renting our own car and driving to Chaak Tun. It was a little hard to find, only because the area didn't seem to have many street signs. We found Juarez Ave and followed it inland. We were hesitant because we didn't know how far to go or if we were on the right path. Then we saw the entrance sign on the side of the road and were very excited to have found it. It actually wasn't hard to find, we just had to trust or directions. When we arrived we found out that we had to do a guided tour, but that was fine because there was a friendly staff member ready to take us once we got suited up. We went on the 2 hour tour and had a great time. The cenotes are really cool and they give you a bunch of great information about the rock formations and the history of the Mayans. Although it was a guided tour they showed you an area and then gave you free time to explore on your own before moving on to the next spot. They also give you a flashlight so you can see, since many of the areas are dark. It was a great tour and I would highly recommend it. It was nice to visit a place that wasn't super crowded with tour buses and large groups. We went in the afternoon so I think all of their big tours had ended for the day. I do suggest getting a wetsuit if you get cold at all. We did not get them and we were ok, but by the end of the tour you have been in the water for a long time in dark caves, so needless to say it did get a little chilly and we might have been more comfortable if we ad gotten the wetsuits."

If you are interested in a (not yet overcrowded and commercially exploited) authentic cenote in the region of playa del carmen, you really must see this. We booked this excursion online (only a 7 miles ride from PDC), through Viator - much cheaper than TUI - and had a perfect excursion. In a small group.Our guide Felix, a native Maya, was really outstanding : very professional, extrememy informative and most helpful for al the participants of our group. Especially for my wife who was really afraid before. ..Felix had the skills to make her very comfortable.

We stayed in the Playacar area and decided to take a 15 minute taxi ride (250 pesos each way) to the this Cenote. We had previously read the reviews and decided to give it a try. The admission is $30 pp and included a guided tours and snorkel equipment. Free lockers are available to store personal effects. By arranging our own transportation we saved over $200 from a similar tour group excursion. When our taxi dropped us off, we made arrangements for him to return to pick us up.  During our 2 1/2 hour stay, we visited 2 underground water filled caves (Cenotes). The water temperature is 62-64 degrees but it very refreshing and no one felt cold. The site also had some local wildlife including monkey's and several bird species. Our tour guide Jorge was very informative as well as amusing. A photographer took photos of our group along the way and a personalized CD was available for sale after the tour. This tour was informative and affordable and I highly recommend it. "

            "review": "Perfect day activity from Cozumel or PDC. If you are in Cozumel and looking for a short but moderately challenging adventure, this Cenote trip is perfect. Bad weather in Cozumel sent my nephew and I onto the Ferry ($10 each way per person) in Cozumel to Playa Del Carmen (45 minutes) at 9 AM, arrived PDC at 945AM. We tracked down a tour guide service within a block of the ferry landing. He arranged for taxi service to and from Chaak Tun, tickets for two, and wetsuits and mask and flashlight, all for $100 US or 1500 pesos. The cab drive was less than 15 minutes. Chaak Tun does not present itself well as you approach and enter the site. In fact, it was pretty \"rural\". But the basics were there and we were well received, and were handed a flashlight, shoes, googles, and a wetsuit. 5 minutes to change and place belongings in a keyed locker and we were set. Just one other couple was with us so with guide there were only five in the group. Before we entered the water, we were given a life jacket to wear. I don't want to spoil anything, but suffice to say, the 2 hour experience was pretty cool. Treading water through caverns, viewing awesome and beautiful structures, seemingly endless expanses of clear water beneath us, all was just refreshing. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10 for modestly active people, it's about 5 maybe 6. On a cool scale, it's about a 8.5 maybe 9. The guide, Ricardo was passionate, entertaining, and very safe. Novices will find this awesome, skilled divers will be well entertained. The trip ended after about 2 hours, and the same cab driver who brought us was waiting for us. We were back at the Ferry dock by 12:30, easily in time for a relaxing lunch and then the 2PM ferry return to Cozumel. In summary, leave Cozumel on Ferry at 9AM, be back in Cozumel at 3PM. In between, a remarkable experience and relatively high value for the dollar. Would definitely recommend for couples or families with active and adventurous kids."

This included wetsuits, water shoes, life vests, masks and underwater lights. Hard hats were also included but optional. There is a dressing area and lockers are provided. We toured several cenotes with amazing caverns. It was like something from an Indiana Jones movie. It was very clean and Ricardo explained the formations, the minerals present, as well as the bats a a birds and spiders present in these caves. He also gave information about the Mayan culture and history including the rituals of cleansing themselves and their early sauna! He didn't overtalk like some guides and was very helpful with the younger kids in our group. A photographer is present to capture your adventure and we purchased a CD with pictures from our tour and included are great pictures of the cenotes and jungle area."

We are so glad we made that choice! Chaak Tun was an affordable and fun outing. We drove there from Playa del Carmen (10-15 minutes) around 1 in the afternoon and there were very few other tourists there. I believe it was about $30 US per person which included life jackets, goggles, flashlights, water shoes, and wet suit. We chose not to wear the wetsuits and while the water was cold getting in, it really was find after a minute. Abel was our guide and he was fantastic. We went into the caves with him and one other couple. We liked his style because he offered us choices about what we wanted to do, some options more adventurous than others. We peered under the water into deep and seemingly never ending caves, exfoliated with fine sand from the cave floor, and even turned off all our lights at one point to experience total darkness. Unless you are a champion swimmer (and maybe a hotshot) I would wear a life jacket, as most of the time you cannot touch the bottom. I should add that I did this tour 4 months pregnant, and despite having to decline the option to crawl through a small space to traverse caves, I was totally fine during the tour. Nothing too strenuous, however if you are afraid of darkness or tight spaces you will likely wish you never got in the water. I definitely recommend this trip to those visiting the area, particularly if you need an afternoon out of the sun. We purchased the picture CD for $20 US afterwards just for fun since we could not bring our camera into the water with us. Hopefully you will have Able as a guide. He was awesome."

The place is not a disneyland by any means and is far more authentic. The formations and cave exploring was amazing (watch your head). There are 2 caves, and you get to swim in both of them (they are both different and very cool at the same time). Tour time is about 2 hours. When we went there it was 720 pesos for 2 people (included wetsuit, goggles, flashlight, and water shoes). Pro-tip, go in the afternoon. We went at 1:30 and had 3 other people with us (other tours at the time looked like they were just couples). Abel was awesome, explained everything, and showed us all the hidden nooks and 'special' spots of the cave. It was well worth it. The guides work on tips only, so help them out... they all speak spanish, and english very well. Additionally, if you don't have a waterproof camera, their is a photographer that takes your photos at certain spots. They sell the CD to you for like $30 I think. We took a taxi from our hotel for like $50 USD + tip and he returned in 2 hours to bring us back to the city. There is no taxi service, as this place is in the middle of nowhere. I wouldn't recommend attempting to walk/bike here from the city either. All in all, it was worth it. It's not a resort cenote like some of the other commercialized ones, and it's a more personal and authentic cenote. The water is incredibly refreshing. If you're a good swimmer they will let you go in without a life jacket. The 'hardest' part of the tour is that if you want to see some cool stuff, you have to cross under a wall that is about 1-2 meters wide. Probably takes about 2-3 seconds under water. Kids could do it just fine.If you're looking to kill a few hours in the afternoon after getting sunburned at the beach, highly recommended."

This attraction is newer in its operation but the people working to make it something are really eager for you to have a good experience visiting the caverns and cenotes that is such an integral part of their world and culture. They have a modicum of equipment and facilities at this time but since it is new and up-and-coming it wasn't as though we had to wait for the group in front of us to finish their tour before we would have wetsuits and masks. I would, if I did it again, probably bring my own mask and wet suit (since I am a diver and own these pieces of equipment) but most people do not so its good that they are working to provide these items especially because you are going to submerge yourself in water that catches your breath at first but then is quite a comfortable temperature with a wet suit. And you are going to want a mask so as to really enjoy viewing all there is to see under the surface. The tour guide was knowledgeable and provided a lot of interesting info on the culture of the Mayan people and how the Cenotes played a part in that culture. He indicated that the Cenotes were integral to their spiritual practice and I could definitely see that and really take that into my own spiritual sense. The price was right, it wasn't too long (I could have stayed a lot longer but this is one of the smaller sites so I will just have to go back and do more exploring) and the people were friendly and helpful. What more can you ask for on vacation right?"

And it's very cool, particularly if you HAVEN'T done Rio Secreto, and ridiculously cool if it's your first cenote swim/snorkel. It is decidedly bigger and more interesting than the ones outside Valladolid, and Gran Cenote down near Tulum.The guides are excellent, quite knowledgeable, with a very good command of English. My girlfriend's flashlight burnt out, and our guide found us all a nice place to stand, then swam his butt off and ran his butt off to go get her a replacement, and was back about 3 and 1/2 minutes later. He also allowed another guest's daughter, who was an excellent swimmer, to take the tour without a lifejacket and explore several caverns with him that were only accessible via submerged entries (and hence impossible to visit in a lifejacket).The fee includes a shortie (yeah, the water's a bit chilly, but not bad once you get used to it and the shortie fills with the layer of water required for insulation), a mask, snorkel, and flippers. And with the strength of the dollar, as of April 2015, it was something like $24 per person.Good fun. We were a middle-aged couple, but the younger couple with teenage kids had a blast as well, and it would work for any kid that could swim and understand instructions, let's say age 7 or 8 and up."

The others that our resort recommended were just big swimming holes that you can dive in. This one is a great experience, real cave swimming. We've been in many cave tours but never in the water before. Our guide, Abel, was very informative and helpful. He was careful with a few older people in our group, and we had no problems at all. You're given a wetsuit, water shoes, flashlight, lifejacket, and goggles. You can opt to skip the lifejacket but it does help keep you afloat so you don't have to tread water a lot. I expected the water to be a lot colder but it wasn't bad at all. I think it could easily be done without the wetsuit but it did help somewhat. Overall I'd really recommend this tour for $30 US per person. You can buy a dvd at the end for $20 or 30 with photos of your group if you want."

This place has less crowd and the guide was able to host the small group intimately, the guide swam with the group and guided different water passages.. it was the best cenote that I visited this trip.. (better than some other better known ones)..The facility still has some room for improvements but the cenotes were amazing.. our guide was awesome.. Would definitely go back to this one when I am in that region"

Being a Sunday, we knew there wouldn't be a whole lot of action at this local cenote, Chaak Tun. This is our third visit to Playa, second cenote. This is more like a cavern. The \"ceilings\", if you will, of the cenote are super low in spots, so you need to be aware. If you are claustrophobic, this isn't for you. There are spots that are a bit tight, and do to the amount of bats and their guano, it can get stagnant as it did in this visit. I was ready to gag at one point from the stench. If I may be a bit graphic, it smelled like rotten gum disease or a-double-s. I have glaucoma and permanent filters in my eyes, so I have to be super protective of them. I didn't feel like I could swim comfortably in this cenote- even with goggles. I was disappointed. I enjoyed Dos Ojos cenote better, because it was a real underground \"river\"."

We drove there in our rental car, it was about 12 miles outside of Playa. There's a divided highway most of the way, then the road jogs where it narrows down to a two lane road. Shortly after that, you'll see some white rocks on the side of the road with \"Chaak Tun\" spelled out on them and then it's right there on the right. There was no one else there waiting, we did run into other groups down in the caves but it wasn't a big deal. There were nine of us but we were quicly outfitted with our shortie wetsuits, flashlights, and goggles. They had water shoes if you wanted to wear them, I wore my chacos. The goggles were a little blurry, if you have your own I would recommend bringing them. The water was cold, we definitely were glad to have the wetsuits. You can wear a PFD if you want to, you get those after you go down into the first cave.And we got Felix for our guide, he was the best! He speaks great English, has a great sense of humor, and was proud to educate us about his Mayan heritage and beliefs. We did the \"adventurous\" tour and most of us ducked underwater into a small cavern at one point of the tour, the ceiling is just about a foot over your head. Other than that, you are in pretty big spaces. Felix showed us how the caverns extend underwater throughout the caves by holding us down underwater (if you wanted to.) We were in there for about 2 1/2 hours total, at one point you come out and can take a bathroom break and then you go into another cave.We saw turtles, bats, fish, and Mut Mut birds. There was a photographer who was around (not in the water) and he took group pictures of us which were available for purchase at the end of the trip. We bought the disc and the pics were pretty good, not great. If you have an underwater camera, bring it.It was a great experience and I would highly recommend it."

Apperently there is an affordable housing shortage in PdC area, and this is the only alternitive for some. The Cenote has a privet swimming hole kind of feel to it. They had changing rooms, a small snack shack and they did provide you with Hard Hats for the walk down and into the cenote. The guide from the Snorkel Shop, Alex, was very experienced and knew a lot about the area and the history of the cenotes. He did a great job of getting our group into the cold water. The anticipation of the coldness was worse than the actual temperature. I did have a surfing shirt on so that helped. I saw some other people with 1/2 scuba suits on. this would be nice for diving...but was probably to much of a pain to put on for a snorkel trip. The cave is lit along the snorkeling \"path\". But Alex passed out small underwater flashlights for us to share. It would have been much better if we all had our own light. When you snorkel, I find that it is best done solo to explore all the nooks and crannies. Alex knew a lot about the wildlife, marine life and insects in the cave.

A few of the reviews on here mentioned getting to the cenotes later in the day to avoid crowds, we got there at 2 and there were no crowds at all. Our guide had mentioned that there were large tour busses there not long before, so going later does appear to be the trick. Our guide, Alex, was excellent, very knowledgeable of the area and the cenotes. We learned more about the Mayan culture from him than we did from our guide in Tulum! We also had our 2 young children with us (4 & 7) and were concerned this activity might not be age appropriate. It was great for young children, both kids loved it and were quite entertained by all the bats! One word of advice, while they do provide all the equipment (wet suits, shoes, etc) for adults, they did not have wet suits nor shoes for the kids. Turned out to be fine, the waters weren't too cold and they wore their regular sandals for walking and slipped them off before getting into the water. The crystal clear water and rock formations were unbelievably beautiful! Combined with the story sharing of the significance the cenotes played in the Mayan culture made for quite a special afternoon trip that we won't soon be forgetting!There is one small disappointment, I read all the reviews of a photographer tagging along and selling photos for $30 afterwards. I personally thought that would be a great arrangement, my hands would be free and I could just enjoy the scenery. There was no photographer or offer to purchase pics. So ask before you head out on the trails and grab your water proof camera, you're going to want to have pictures to remember this experience by!"

I told him there was 6 of us, that we had taken 2 cabs to get there ($240 pesos for both cabs there... and another $160 to get back to Playa) and wanted to tour the cenote and caverns, and were willing to pay a little extra.

We took a taxi to the Cenote from our hotel. The fauna & natural beauty of the place was breathtaking! It was not far from Playa del Carmen. I read other reviews that said to go after 2PM. We followed that advise and it worked out perfectly. We got there right around 2PM & basically had the whole place to ourselves. Our guide was very knowledgeable! I loved learning about the history of the place. We also had a photographer take pictures of us (optional) I think it was worth it, we got several good pictures. I think the photographer was around $30. It was a lot cheaper to do it this way rather than with a tour. We got to go at our own pace and it was just us, so we got to have all our questions answered and because we were such good swimmers, we actually swam under the water to enter another cave, which was thrilling! We went in early December and didn't have any problems with mosquitoes, however the caves did have a few bats, but they weren't flying around or anything. I'm scared of bats and it didn't even bother me! The equipment was included in the cost of the tour. We got a wetsuit, underwater flashlight and snorkel. They had lockers to use for free so you could lock up any valuables. We asked our taxi driver to come back for us and he opted to just wait for us even though it was like 1 1/2 - 2 hours before we were done. We gave him a good tip when we returned to our hotel, which he was really happy about. Overall, it was amazing & really inexpensive to go by yourself. Have fun, I know we did!"

The tour lasted approximately 2-3 hours, with about a little more than an hour in the water in the cave. The water was cool when you first went in but you got used to it, and it was so clear!! It felt like you could almost touch the bottom (but it was really 25 ft down in some parts). You were led by a guide and flashlights the whole time and got to explore the entire cave. Afterwards we were treated to a traditional Mexican lunch which was delicious. The cost of the tour included a wet suit, water shoes, life vest, hard hat, snorkel gear and locker rental. The guides were very knowledgeable and clearly seemed to enjoyed giving tours. I would definitely recommend this tour!"

Guides are mandatory and I was happy to learn more about the cenote and Mayan culture but unfortunately Abel didn't seem to know anything at all. He didn't know what a cenote was or how it formed; at the end of the tour the other guide thankfully explained it to me. I was also hoping to learn more about the Mayan culture too but we skipped over it in 30 seconds. I would hope the a tour guide would at least know the basics as the amazing cenote did deserve a knowledgeable guide to compliment it. I still recommend the cenote as it is amazing, just ask for a competant guide!"

The recent tour of Chaak Tun is now competing for the number one spot. Like most cenotes it doesn't look like much from the outside.We were a little put off by the $30/person price tag and required guide since most of the cenotes in the area are a couple bucks and self guided. However, the guide is definitely necessary. We were in a group of 4 with a guide named Felix and he was fantastic., The smaller group you are in the better because you get to do more things while in the caves. At first it was a little freaky down in the caves with the bats flying around and the small quarters. However, once you get in the water and start swimming around, you forget where you are and focus on the natural wonder around you. The peace that this particular cenote provides is profound. It has such a calming effect on anyone who enters it. I wish I would have had a waterproof camera. It would have been great to take photos although I'm not sure how well they would have done the place justice. Also, most of the time you're treading water so if you opt out of the life jacket it might have been a pain trying to juggle a camera, a flashlight and a snorkel mask all while swimming. Don't miss this one-just west of Playa del Carmen on the main road."

Bring a waterproof camera or phone case or you will have to purchase a cd from the park (about 25 usd), it does include some beautiful pictures of the park though. They also said that procee do help the Mayan people who keep up the park, so that's always a plus. Go ... it's so worth it!"

Explaining it was our last day, they said they would look for a guide willing to take us through. They found a guide willing to take us through as long as we hurried and got through in an hour. Note: the cenote is only paid, not able to see without tour. We paid roughly $20 / person, got wet-suits, life preservers, lockers to secure our personal belongings, and started the tour. They start with a history of Mayan culture which was very interesting. Then we entered the cenote. As we arrived so late, it was dark outside. We received flashlights. The water was gorgeous and was pretty cold but with a wet-suit, you get over it quick. Even though we arrived late, we received a prolonged tour - we were in the Cenote for over 2 hours. The guide was very interested in mayan culture and they are quite funny. Our first flashlight broke, then the second one started flickering. But the guide made jokes and made us feel very comfortable. The guide said they work on tips / are not paid so we tipped but the cenote and tour were well worth it. It is back in the country, about 10-15 minutes from downtown Playa del Carmen. Well worth it and unexpectedly one the better parts of the trip."

The guide is $360 pp and takes you through the underground labirynth and gives you some history lesson also. views are spectacular, you will see many cenotes, some with natural light and some with lamps installed - it's quite dark in general so take waterproof flashlight if you have one. the whole experience takes about 2 hours, we were lucky to have the guide just for 2 of us and I can't imagine doing it as part of bigger group (I know they do it).Tip: If you are afraid of small spaces choose another attraction.Overall amazing experience but pricey for what you get."

We wanted to visit a Cenote without going through a tour company and through research found out Chaak Tun is only 4-5km from PDC and can be reached by bicycle. So we rented two bikes for the day and headed out on Av. Juarez toward the jungle. After seemingly leaving all civilization, we finally happened upon Chaak Tun. Upon arrival, the staff were very inviting and we were told of the 1.5-2 hour guided tour for 360 pesos/person. For the cost you get a wetsuit, mask, flashlight and water shoes, along with the guided tour, which frankly is well worth the cost as you couldn't possibly discover all these caves have to offer without a guide. You also get a locker to put your belongings in which is a relief. They are not high-security lockers by any means so don't bring more than you need - Money (see below), a change of clothes, towel and maybe a sandwich or snack for after, as the swimming is a bit of work!Felix was our absolutely fantastic guide - One of the best tour guides I've met - So knowledgeable, personable, helpful - and full of humor. He will cater the tour to your swimming ability and makes the whole experience delightful. It really is a great little adventure, as long as you aren't claustrophobic or afraid of the water (or the dark.)As for costs, besides paying for transportation (Taxi/Rental Car/Bicycle) my recommendation is to bring the 360 pesos for admission per person plus enough to tip the guide. I'd recommend a minimum of 100-200 pesos. Photos taken during the tour are very nice and cost 250 pesos. We bought them and did not regret it."

Taxi drivers from Playa either said they didnt know where it was or they had never heard of it, but we just walked up to the 30th and had no trouble, 150pesos one way. When we arrived we were surprised that it was 320+ pesos each, yes they supplied the shorty wet suits and masks but there was no discount if you have brought your own gear, I was still surprised on the price. They were pleasant but personally not at that price. I wouldnt recommend at that price, also they have limited lockers so we had to leave our belongings at the entrance which the chap said he wouldnt be leaving and 2 mins later he walked up the path!"

This is not overly touristy, it's still pretty rough/wild. Would highly recommend. It is hard to get good pictures with very low light (and you are swimming most of the time). A van from Playcar was $55 for 5 people round trip, arranged by the hotel. The cenote is just outside of Playa del Carmen so it's a short ride. Whole trip probably took us 3 hours, but we really took our time to enjoy it."

You need hats to get in as the ceiling is low, then you come up to this wonderful tree that opens up to the sky, just gorgeous. We then proceded to the caves where it was dark, more closed up....in other word perfect!! just has a cave should be.

Due to it not being overly known it has yet to get the over the top tourist feel and that was a very welcome thing. The cave is beautiful and they have not done a lot to it by adding outside influences or modernizations. There is limited lighting in the cave which gives you the ability to take in the natural beauty of the place. Swimming in a cenote had been on my bucket list for some time. This is definitely a great way to cross that off. Our guide, Felix, clearly had a passion for the cultural significance of the place. It showed and it made the trip much more enjoyable and informative for me and my family. They provided wetsuits, masks, helmets and life jackets if you wanted them. The water is rather chilly so the wetsuit was a very good idea. The helmets were only needed in certain spots and Felix took great care guiding us through and showing us the cave. As there is limited lighting the only light at times was a small dive flashlight. If you are bothered by the dark, bringing one of your own dive lights may not be a bad choice. If you are looking for something off the beaten path and sort of an eco-type of trip, I would definitely recommend taking the tour at Chaak Tun."

You're required to take the tour, which I felt was overpriced (around $30/person) and too long (almost 3 hours).

It feels like diving and swimming in an Indiana Jones -movie, we've never experienced anything like that before. A couple of things worth knowing though: we were told in advance that there are no lockers to keep your personal belongings, so we brought nothing but our clothes and some cash. This is not true, since there are toilets and lockers, and this would have been nice to know. We would have brought at least a better camera. Secondly; we read somewhere that the cost is 100 pesos per person, but in reality it was 360 pesos. Which is not bad for this amazing adventure, but considering the locker-issue we had just enough money with us to get it but just a ridicilously little tip for the guide, Alex, who was so great and who works there voluntarely!! So; bring enough cash and cameras if you wish. All the equipment (snorkels, shoes, life jackets, helmets) you'll get there. We higly recommend this wonderful place!! Once in a life time experience!"

Firstly, the guides are not paid, meaning you feel obliged to leave a large tip. The entrance fee is maddeningly high and you are followed around by a lady with a camera who then charges an extortionate fee if you want the pictures on a memory card.

The ride was smooth, the ferry boats have both indoor seats and.outdoor seats and are super comfortable. 45 minutes later you arrive and your guide is waiting for you to take you to.the cenote. A short ride on an airconditioned bus and we arrived at the cenote. It was an Experience. Crystal clear water inside a dark cave filled with stalactites and stalagmites. Nature all around. We where given snorkel gear and a flashlight so we could see how clear it was. You can also take.your own gear. It does require a little physical activity tho. Take good water shoes, theres a lot of rocks when you enter a cenote, also when in the cave you will have to walk up some stairs and slippery rocks so you need to be very careful. After the cenotes we where given a delicious traditional meal inside another one of the caves. It doesnt get any more natural than that. The peace you find in these places is unbelievable. Our tour guide was amazing. Do not miss the experience of swimming in one of these places, believed to be entrances to the underworld by the mayans. PLEASE PLEASE ! DO.NOT use any sunblock or any kind of lotion before you go into these places, do not touch the stalagmites and stalactites as this will stop their growth and it takes hundreds of years for them to grow.Thank You Hope you find this helpful"

The facility had restrooms which were rustic but clean. Lockers were provided but not used by our group. Lifejackets were provided and necessary for our kids. I brought swim shirts for the kids, but they were not needed. The water was cool but just fine. We swim in Lake Michigan regularly, and it was about the same as summer water temp there. We entered two different cave systems and both were beautiful. We were encouraged to jump into one and we did! The kids loved the adventure. I have to say it was so unique and interesting.

He shared a lot about Mayan culture which was an added bonus. Wet suits are optional but made for a very comfortable swim-- you only need masks (snorkels optional but not really needed-- as the sights to see are largely above you and at times you have the option of diving down a bit to see entrances to caves and occasional fish.) We really enjoyed the Grand Cenote but the caves at this one were in comparison rather awe inspiring. Crystal clear water and when it was dark the flashlights that they provided worked really well above and in the water. When coming out we mistakenly left behind a wallet with cash and credit cards and assorted things in a beach bag. We did not become aware until 30 minutes out. When we returned our guide had retrieved our belongings from a bench and stored everything in a locker to await our return--what kindness and a great relief !

If your looking for an easy outing from Playa, I would recommend you visit this cenote which is only about a 15 minute cab ride, paid 175 pesos for the ride out and had someone who spoke spanish help me negotiate for 150 pesos for a taxi back to 5th ave. Going out I handed the taxi driver a piece of paper with the cenote name and even then he had to call in for directions, but it is just straight north of Playa a very simple drive. It cost us $30 per person for snorkel, life vest, wet suit, water shoes and a guide. Free lockers are available. There were only six people in the group I went out in but it would probably depend on how many people show up at the same time. We first went into a large open cave and just swam around ourselves for about 15 minutes. The water did not feel cold to us but others in our group without wetsuits did think it was cold. The cave was fascinating especially if it is your first time in a cenote. Then we walked a little bit to another cave where the guide led us through the various caverns and paths. Our guide could not speak any English and while he tried to be helpful to us, was a little confusing at times. Luckily one of our group could interpret and also lucky that he had a flashlight as the guide had a lot of trouble getting his to work. As it is very dark in some spots, I was very grateful for the extra flashlight. Despite the poor guiding, the cenote itself is extraordinary and truly a wonder. We had a lot of fun and am so glad we took a day off from the beach to do this."

Our tour began walking through to one of the locations with Andy giving us full narration along the way. We entered / exited caves at three particular locations and each time we could get into the cool mineral water or opt to wait it out. It is amazing how crystal clear the water is there! It was cold but it was soooo refreshing after being in the hot sun. In two of the caves, there was the \"Mexican Paparazzi\" snapping photos. At the end of the tour I purchased them both for $20! That is reasonable so don't be cheap and negotiate. The last stop of our tour was a traditional Mayan/ Mexican lunch that was prepared and eaten in the cave. Andy explained what each dish was, how it was prepared and any significance associated with it. Delicious does not begin to describe it! Overall I feel like this is a can't miss experience."

This is advertised as a cenote, but unlike pictures I have seen of those formations, this is really more of an underground cave system, rather than a sink hole. After a 10-15 minute ride from Playa Del Carmen down a dirt road, you come upon an opening in a fence with a small parking area and a disheveled sign overhead announcing that you have arrived at Chaak Tun. Hard to believe from the exterior what all the hype is about. There is a small entry hut where they take your payment (credit cards accepted) and suit you up with booties and a johnny wet suit (you will definitely want these; consider, also, wearing a long sleeve shirt under to help keep you warm), mask and snorkel. You can do without the snorkel, but definitely take the mask. From there, you march down a short path and down some stairs into the cave entrance. Life jackets are optional, but with the chilly water, lack of strong lighting and being in an uncertain surrounding, you will feel much more comfortable taking the jacket. From there, it's into the water! After adjusting to the sudden temperature drop and the eerie feeling of being in the water in a cave, you concentrate on slower breathing and controlling your elevated heart rate. Then you begin to really enjoy the experience - the water is crystal clear. If there are no waves or ripples, you can see right to the bottom from above. The guide takes you through several passages that you can explore. A few were small, but nothing too claustrophobic for me (I am not real good in super tight spaces). We went to the smaller cave first, which I think is the better way to do it as it prepares you better for the bigger cave. There, you walk along a pathway through the cave until you come to a large open area where the cave is open to the sky (hence the cenote, I guess). There are many bats flying around, but they are pretty cool and absolutely harmless. Here, our guide took us to a platform above the water and we jumped in, rather than heading down steps (for the less adventurous, there are steps). More twists and turns through the cave system - fascinating rock formations, ledges, fish, sand and more. Sometimes you can stand; others you must float or swim. At one point, in the very back, our guide offers to turn off the lights completely so that we can experience complete, total darkness for a few minutes. Very cool. Despite a holiday week, we had the place to ourselves in the mid-afternoon. Hard to believe for something so close to town and so well covered in the reviews. It's also a great place to cool down on a hot day."

The water is cool, but since we were here in a very warm day it was actually very nice to be in it. There are lots of caves to see and some are extremely well light. It is a Must Do Experience to come to this Cenote when here in Playa Del Carmen. You will not be disappointed."

I got there early and had a private tour, since no other tourists were around. The cave was fantastic, the water wasn't too cold, and I got everything I needed. Only caution - at that time, the guide spoke mostly Spanish so if that's a concern you may want to go later in the day. All in all - wonderful!"

Cenote Chaak Tun is close enough to the main area ...about a 10 min cab ride from the hotels on 5th ave. We loved it. Our guide Roberto was very patient and gave us an excellent tour. I can't swim but managed fine ...you need to be able to float and they give you a life jacket, goggles and wet suit. It was a 90 min tour through 2 Cenotes..easy to navigate and a very good choice for people like us who want to indulge in some adventure but aren't professional divers or enthusiasts. They even arranged for a cab back for us. All in all very refreshing and satisfying without long lines. One caveat...this place is 3 to 4 miles from the 5th Ave tourist area ...not 0.4 miles as reported by maps app on your phone. We were trying to walk there then realized after asking around that it isn't walkable so we took a cab."

What a great day trip.We took a van-taxi from Grand Mayan Riviera--he knew the spot, but it should not be difficult for anyone to find. The Avenue Juarez is a big, paved street heading out of town, and the site is well marked. We got there around 12, and the taxi driver agreed to come pick us up in 2.5 hours.We were greeted warmly and all costs were explained clearly--$30US per person to go on the full tour; $30US for a photographer to accompany us; the required guide was a \"volunteer,\" and thus would be paid in tips. We got suited up in the provided wetsuits, life jackets, and swimming shoes, and left our belongings in small, locked lockers. Our guide led us through the jungle on a well marked path--think National Park hiking--and down into the caves. There we got snorkel masks (but no breathing tubes) and flashlights, and we got into the water. If you have your own snorkel tube, bring it. Flippers would be useless. A waterproof headlight or flashlight would be good, too--you get one for every two people, so an extra would be nice, but not essential. The water is cool, but the wetsuits kept us pretty comfortable. The caves are huge, with spectacular stalactites and stalagmites--the beautiful pictures on the internet only begin to suggest how magnificent they are. And looking down through the clear water you could see many underwater caverns. We followed a loop around through the caves, and then the guide led us through the jungle to another, huge cave, where we swam around freely.We had a picnic lunch (which we brought with us) on tables set up in another cave. We bought the cd of photographs--about five of the pictures are terrific, and ten are good, and the rest blurry or awkwardly framed--but those 15 good ones made it worthwhile. This is an experience we will want to remember.We had six people in our group--two grandparents, in their 80s, and two twenty-something guys who are very athletic. One of the young men is a scuba diver and has been spelunking. One of the grandparents has macular degeneration and some impaired mobility. Amazingly, this was an activity that everyone enjoyed thoroughly. But if your 80 something grandma isn't quite as adventuresome as ours, this will be too rugged. There are many stairs, and some rocky parts that are uneven for walking. I should add that the guide, Carlos, was wonderfully patient and attentive to Grandma, helping her on the stairs and into the water. She found it challenging, but she did it!We had the caves to ourselves, which was fabulous, and Carlos never seemed in any kind of a hurry. In fact, everybody there was super nice and accommodating.The grandparents offered to take us all to Xcaret. Can't tell you how happy we are we chose to go to Chaak Tun instead."

They are charging gringos $30US. Its worth every penny. They provide a wetsuit, water shoes, and a mask.We were also lucky enough to see a local mating pair of leopards."

From Playa del Carmen, get a cab and tell them to take you to Cenote Chak tuun. 15-20 minute ride. Bring your own snorkel and mask if you have one (and wet suit). If not, you can rent from them for $30 per person. There are locals that serve as guides on a volunteer basis. Carlos was a local guy who was AWESOME. Bring cash to tip them. There was also a photographer there that stayed with us for an hour and we got a whole CD full of pictures for $30. Their main crowd are cruise ship excursions so of you are there when there Is not one, you have the whole place to yourself."

Anyway we decided to go because the weather forecast called for rain, which would have not been a good time on the beach. The guide was very patient and knowledgeable. The water was a little chilly but the body does get used to it, and you'll warm up a little after moving around. This was definitely a highlight of our trip."

Our guide was informative and helpful. The scenery was breathtaking with bats, stalactites from above and below in the crystal clear water. There were two Cenotes, one partially open to outside with a beautiful tree growing up through the opening above and the second totally enclosed. Be aware that the water is cool but not unbearable, you get used to the temp very quickly, it's similar to a regular cool swimming pool. Just jump on in and be done. The views are like nothing I've ever seen and shouldn't be missed. There were many levels of fitness and ages, everyone seemed to do just fine. Move slowly as there are slip points and rocks to watch, if you pay attention to where you are going you should be fine. Once we were done with the pools, we were fed a delicious lunch. There was a variety of spice levels to the salsa, tacos, fresh fruit and it was all really good. I'd do this excursion again in a hot second!!"

It is not longer 100 pesos, it was 340 pesos- new ownership according to them and they do not negotiate. There may have been a better use of the money but it was very pretty, that included mask, wetsuit, vest and waterproof flashlight. Do not take a tour there if you are staying in Playa. They are a rip off. One attempted to charge us 700 pesos per person! We took a taxi for 150 pesos. Grand total for two: 730 pesos. We made new friends and they drove us back to the playa so we did not take a taxi back. Sweet small place with a little ion about Mayan culture to boot."

The stalagtites and stalagmites were massive, the guide was great, and it really was one of the most interesting and unique experiences I've had - especially on vacation. I wouldn't pass it up.NOTE: In hindsight, I left my camera in the car, for fear of it getting wet - which really is a total bummer because we could've taken some awesome photos in the caves. I would either bring along a waterproof camera from wal-mart, or bring your camera along on the first leg and just leave it in the \"staging\" cave before you jump in the water. It's too cool not to capture. Also, if you have water shoes - bring and wear them!~250 pesos per person / half price for kids - well worth it"

Our group consisted of five people and the staff was great in making sure that groups were kept separate to allow for a more private and enjoyable experience. I must admit I was a little anxious about going into a cenote as it was my first time. Thinking of the dark, the bats, and the enclosed space sort of bothered me. Once inside I was glad I went. It was an experience I'll never forget (I still wasn't a fan of the bats but they certainly didn't bother us). As part of our tour we were given waterproof flashlights, life jackets, and a snorkel and mask. I know that with some tours you can use a wet suit. Being from New Englanders we found the water inside the cenote refreshing and not too cold. The water is crystal clear and there are some smaller sized fish swimming around. The stalactites and stalagmites were incredible. I would highly recommend visiting this cenote!"

It was one of the atraction during the extreme activity day in the woods .It was a very fun day inc visiting arcological sites , eating lunch in a maya villige that was cooked by them , omega in the forest and more .... Personally ,I don't think that it suitable to come with little kids, but there is lots of other option like water park, swim w dulphin and more other version of trip in the forest that more fit for enjoying the day w kids outside the resort ."

You take a taxi to the other side of the highway and take a ride into the jungle. the cenote is about 15 minutes from the center of Playa Del Carmen. the people are great - very professional and helpful. there are lockers for your stuff and then they take you with a guide down into the cenotes. the entry fee is $30 US including guide and waterproof light and lifejacket. the first cave is small and is really for getting used to the relatively cold water. then they take you into the much larger cave system and you get to swim into the stalactite covered caves and see the cave roof and underground formations. really a great tour and an unusual experience. Highly recommended. Our guide was Santiago and he was excellent."

He is a funny guy who gonna explain you all the secrets of this caves. The tour is more or less 1.30 hours long and in loco is available to rent all the necessary equipment. In comparison to Gran Cenote this place is a way much better."

A lovely family with two little girls provided delightful entertainment when our guide's explanations went over my head.The management provided a wet suit, locker, mask, and underwater flashlight to equip ourselves for the plunge. Still, the shock of the cold water was unexpected, but a wonderful (though abrupt) shift from the heat of the day. We saw a few fish swimming in the water and many mursielagos--bats--nesting among the stalactites over our heads. The three hours we learned and swam underground passed all too quickly."

We had heard that it was more natural than those which are part of big theme parks and we were not disappointed. There are 2 cenotes that take about 2 hours to explore fully with a guide, we took the basic package which was about $20 and did not include flashlights or snorkeling equipment which was quite sufficient. The cenotes are both stunning in their own way and we were lucky enough to visit them alone as we arrived mid afternoon - apparently all the crowds had already dissipated. Highly recommended!!!"

Although the water temperature was very cold, somewhere around 60 to 65 degrees, it still was extraordinary. We went to the smaller cave to swimming in the river and get cooled off, where we were able feel how cold the water was. From there we proceeded to the large cave to swim. They provided each of us with helmets to protect our heads, a flotation vest and swim mask. We then made our way down to the river inside the cave, all the while ducking and squatting to keep from hitting the rocks growing all around us. Seeing all the nooks and crannies where bats were and watched as they flew all around. Once we made it down to the entry point we were given a waterproof flashlight to use and jumped in. The water was crystal clear and you could see all the way to the bottom, on average from 10 to 15 feet deep. There were many places you could stand but the most fun was swimming around in the deeper areas. After swimming and exploring for about a hour, we stepped out of the river and proceeded to another section of the cave where we were provided with an authentic Mayan lunch. I have seen and done many things in my life but I never would have thought I would be swimming in a river inside a cave. This is one attraction I recommend you try if you happen to go to this part of Mexico."

It was two dry cenotes areas just for walking in (like caves) and 2 wet ones for swimming. Only one of the swimmable ones was interesting as it looked tiny from outside and had depths that you could see inside. Nothing super beautiful or even colorful like the big lake ones a little away from town. Ten or fifteen minutes of swimming in each wet ones plus walking around the cave ones. The only good thing is that at that price, it is not crowded especially since these are small swimming areas in small caves."

Snorkle, wet suit, locker, wet shoes, etc. They don't tell you this but you have to have a tour guide. You also have to tip him. He said the minimum is usually $10.00 usd. We gave him 15.00. Not for the faint at heart. The water is dark and it's deep and you must travel by water. You can touch certain things. It's really dark and almost scary! You can see tons of bats, spiders, fish, etc. We were lucky enough to see a turtle :-D. There is one part where you have to let go of the life jacket and swim through an underwater cave. We opted not to do that because we are chickens :-p. Make sure you wear the wetsuit. The water is super cold. All in all, great price for 2 hours. I highly recommend. Just take the road that the ferry to Cozumel is on all the way west and you will run into it on your right. It's past the main highway and past the check point you come across."

For $36 USD you get a tour guide (in my case it was just my husband and me), a flash light, goggles, a wet suit, a locker for storage, and a hard hat. They take you through two different cenotes and explain the cave, the various formations, point out the wild life (mostly spiders, bats, birds, and catfish) and let you explore the various parts of the cave uninterrupted. We were staying in Playa, so we just paid a taxi to drive us there and wait for us to finish (it takes about 1 - 1 1/2 hours to explore). But we could have just had him drop us and then called before viewing the second cenote (a smaller quicker cave to explore) and that would have worked out just as well. I highly recommend spending time at Chaak Tun. I didn't visit other cenotes to compare, but from what I've read, heard and could tell, this experience trumps all of the other nearby cenotes. One more thing, be sure to take directions because many cabs and hotels aren't familar with this cenote yet."

There we were met by our guide, Jorge, who was essential to our good time as he pointed out the stalagmites, stalactites, and how they are formed. We squiggled through caverns, swam through crystal clear waters and were awed by the majesty created by nature. Everyone was thrilled with their experience and very glad that we came.

The entrance fee was 350, and for that I got torch hire, wet shoe hire and guide. I was told you couldn't do this without the guide and to be honest aftera few minutes in the cave I could see that even if I could, I wouldn't have wanted to go without one. It's not really for the faint of heart, so if you get clostraphobic you might want to think twice. That said it should be pointed out that this really isn't dangerous, as long as you listen and do what the guide says. The really great thing about the guide was he was sooooo patient. Everything was do you want to do take photos here, do you want to do this, etc. I never once felt rushed, which was quite refreshing to be honest. All I can say is just go. Forget the other places that charge the earth and often have an artificial feeling about them. Certainly two of the best hours I have spent in this region. One important point to mention is that this place whilst close to playa is actually out in the middle of nowhere, so if you go by taxi I would recommend asking them to come and pick you up later, which they will usually do. And don't be a fool and go try walking back. When they say, it's a jungle out there, in this case they actually mean it. If people want to camp they need a permit from the government, this helps them work out where to collect the bodies once the jaguars have finished with them.... Joking aside locals in the region do get killed by them, so don't ruin your holiday by becoming a toothpick... Again, it's all safe as long as you are sensible."

You just head straight across the highway and stay on Juarez Avenue. Was a great few hours snorkeling/swimming and discovering the underwater caverns and experiencing total silence and darkness in one when we all shut down our lights and were quiet for 5 mins. True relaxation! A must do if you like discovering all the cenotes in the mayan riviera. They have everything there that you need..snorkel equipment, water shoes (we'd bring our own next time), helmets if you want them, life jackets if you want them, and there is a person taking pictures if you like. Picture purchase price is $10. It was 200 pesos to get in."

As soon as your get off the ship they have a sign where you pick up a sticker which gets you on a nice air conditioned ferry ride to Playa Del Carmen. The boat ride can be a little bumpy, so try to find a seat in the center of the boat. Once at Playa Del Carmen you are met with your excursion guide who than places you into a nice air conditioned bus that takes you directly to Cenote Chaak Tun. On the way they give some history of the caves and also some history of Mexico. There's some interesting information shared by the guides. Upon arrival you are given water shoes, life jackets, lockers and helmets. After you change you make your way through the forest to the cave where you are met by a Mayan priest. A brief history is given about the Mayan people and than you begin to enter the caves.The caves are a great experience. the water is fresh and crystal clear. There are some deep sections, but you have a life vest so there's no reason to panic. You also see some fruit bats, which are harmless. You will get some amazing pictures If you bring a water camera, however they have a photographer which has photos for purchase. The tour lasted about 90 mins.After the cave excursion you are taken to another cave for a great Mexican buffet. The food is really good and drinks are provided. You are than taken back to Playa Del Carmen where you can go to the beach, shop or go to the bars. The beach is beautiful so make you to check that out also. Your tour guides designate a meeting place where you will catch the bus back to the ferry to Cozumel. This was a great excursion, definitely worth the money, they take care of everything and the food is great. I highly recommend it."

I would say that this experience couldn't have been any better. Besides myself and my husband (mid 30s), we brought our 2 children (3 and 8) and my parents (mid 50s). Although it was over the busy holiday, it wasn't crowded and all of us were able to enjoy the cenotes. The first cenote was perfect and the entry was so easy that our daughter with Cerebral Palsy was able to walk down on her own. I felt the whole experience was do-able because there was no pressure. There was no tour that hurried you along; you could enter the water and explore at your own pace. The experience we had here has made us all excited to check out some of the more remote cenotes."

I can\u2019t judge if this is the most beautiful cenote there is in Yucat\u00e1n, but it was the only one that was within reach for my partner and me. We were able to swim and snorkel in two beautiful caves which was an unforgettable experience. I especially liked the fact that it was not overcrowed like so many other cenotes seem to be. On site we were equipped with wet suits, snorkel goggles and flashlights and accompanied by a guide and a photographer to each cave. They tended to disappear from time to time without any further note, and in the end it was the photographer who gave us some information about the place. But we saw interesting rock formations, bats, motmot birds and even fish. The place doesn\u2019t seem to be advertised much, so I could not gather much information before going. The only way getting to the cenote is by taxi. It took us appr. 20 mins from downtown PDC going all the way down on Avenida Benito Juarez. We forgot to arrange a pick-up with the taxi driver, but our guide was kind enough to drop us off at the main street after the tour to grab a taxi. All in all, the place is not enough taken care of and staff appeared to be disorganised, but we enjoyed it very much."

A couple of 2014 updates; many taxi drivers in playa now know this one and will try to charge around 300 pesos for taking you there and back. We, holding on to out pride and the fact that it's quite close by, decided to rent a scooter. We saved 30 pesos, our dignity and had much more fun. The admission now costs 240 pesos per person (we had our own snorkeling equipment). At first we were told that this is the cheapest admission, and includes a life vest and a helmet (.....what?) and a flashlight. Then, all of a sudden, the same \"head guy\" told us that all inclusive price is 360 pesos, and the flashlights were not included in the admission anymore, but he could rent us the flashlight for 100 pesos per flashlight. I went berserk about it and said some less friendly things. After that, we got the nicest private tour guide, Carlos. He didn't make us use the tedious life vests or helmets, showed us where to go, including a dive throug an underwater tunnel (a little panic-provoking but fantastic) and in the end, left us completely alone with two flash lights to explore the amazing caves and tunnels that we almost got lost in. There are alltogether three separate larger caves, two of them can be explored together by diving through the underwater tunnel, and one (the one on the left side of the reception) having endless small passages that can be explored with a flash light, partly by foot (shallow water) and partly by swimming. I suppose there is more artificial lighting in the smaller passages nowadays, but large parts are still pitch black, with some backround screeches from the bats flying above. I doubt that any cenote open to public will top this one. Be careful with the prices, but enjoy some serious cave-exploring!"

If weather is good no problem but it can be a bit windy & choppy sea so be careful if you tend to get seasick. Make sure to have your swimsuit, towel & sweater. The car ride to the caves is for about 15 minutes, you will arrive at the first simple and plain installations where you can change, store your clothing, they will give you water shoes & you can use the toilets. Then you go down into the rain forest towards the caves where you will have some information regarding the Yucatan peninsula & the area. They will give you mask, snorkel & life jackets if you feel you will need it. The limestone caves are awesome!! The guide will swim with the group & will show all the stalagmites & stalactites formations, water is cool but enjoyable. After this beautiful experience the tour includes lunch -surprise- & they will offer a Mexican lunch, simple but very tasty inside another cave which makes it very original. Once it is finished, they will take you to the shopping area where you can go on your own for about 1:30 hours. Very nice area but very expensive! After that you will be taken back to the pier where you will take the boat back to Cozumel."

A guide took us back here and after walking for a while to the jungle came across the cenote. There was a small changing area made of wood from the forrest just outside of it and some people there selling snacks and trinkets. It wasn't what I'd expected at first, but as I let go of my expectations and just went with it I found myself enjoying it more.As an attraction, it's really just fresh water in an unusual container with some fish in it. Being down in the deep cave isn't necessarily thrilling in the sense that it's moderately dangerous nor connected to the history of the people there in some significant manner, but I still found it quite enjoyable. The guide gave a history of how someone had once managed with the assistance of scuba equipment to follow the underground caverns some hundred plus miles to go out to the sea. Whether or not that's true or just an interesting story I don't know - but being in there it was neat to imagine doing that.If you want to test your upper body strength, try doing what the guides do and climb up the rope rather than being pulled up. I managed to get all the way to the top, but was then quite hot and sweaty."

Carlos talked and joked with me the whole time making me feel comfortable in the dark. He slowly and patiently took me through all the caves, pointing out many things as we went along, like bats and a turtle. The water is fresh, but not cold. He also took a few photos of me with my camera, which was super nice as I am travelling alone and it's difficult to snap a good selfie while swimming ;)It took about an hour and a half, I think, to see all three caves but you can take as long as you want. The admission price is 360 pesos ($30) and includes water shoes (you will NOT be able to wear flip flops), life jacket, helmet, and a waterproof flashlight which you will definitely need. These gorgeous cenotes are totally undeveloped, with the exception of a couple of paths and a small platform/stairs.Don't let a little fear keep you from having a very unique experience!!"

But that said, there was nothing about it that felt touristy. The only bummer was the lack of regulation as far as people touching and apparently breaking the stalagtites. As always, bargain your taxi price. I believe you should pay no more than $100mxn each way. Tell them it is at the end (it's not really the end but they will get it) of Juarez and also make sure that they come back to get you in a couple of hours as you will be on a dirt road with zero taxis coming by. They told us the entry fee was $250mxn and well, lets just say that we paid much less than that. It seems the price is a bit flexible.We had read that we should wait until after 1 or 2 in the afternoon when the cruise tours are gone but we got there at noon to a group of loud obnoxious Americans that their guide had to yell at to be quiet! They were decked out in wetsuits, river shoes, and hard hats but we were just fine in bare feet and swim suits. I normally get very cold in water but I was in such awe that I never even got a chill. I would even say that snorkel/mask is optional. I used mine and my friend did not and I don't think her experience was any less because of it.They supplied us a guide free of charge (please tip though) which was great. We swam / walked through beautiful caverns with crystal clear water. I have a bit of a phobia in some water but here I never felt creeped out or claustrophobic. Sure some people might though. Well in cave #2 which we went to solo, there was no light and no people. I tried to swim to the caven opening and was quite freaked out by the darkness which gave my friend a good laugh as she watched from shore after starting \"Oh hell no.\"So anyway....two thumbs up for Chaak Tun!"

After wading through the cenote for a few hundred yards, it opened into a large room, which had an opening from above, that was simply majestic. Here, we were able to take off our helmets, (so we didn't hit our heads while getting there on the cave ceiling) and swim in relative freedom, although we still had life vests on. We went the day after a tropical storm hit, so the water level was high, yet rarely over our heads. After further exploration, we returned to this room and we allowed to swim without life vests, if we were comfortable in doing so. I truly never wanted to leave this place, ever...."

I went to Chaak Tun as part of an excursion with the Snorkel Shop Northern Surf and Turf Tour and was so amazed by the natural beauty of it. The water was so refreshing and the vampire bats were a bit freaky at first but then you get so immersed in the cenote, you forget they are there. Memo, our guide thru the Snorkel Shop (which I highly recommend as a tour company) made sure we were safe with helmets, life jackets and torches and pointed out amazing details to us. Catfish swim all along the bottom and the visibility was so clear. The bottom of the cenote looks so soft but it is many feet down and untouchable by me. Great timing for our visit because as we entered the cenote it was full of people but as we came out, everyone was gone and we got to jump and play in the water all alone. I would of reviewed this cenote thru the Snorkel Shop but I am new to Trip Advisor and thought I could review each tour separately as well as the company, but it turns out only one review per person, regardless of how many tours or times you visited. My apologizes to Graham and I hope you see this link!"

It was a bit of an excursion though, we thought we could walk it from town but after an hour, we flagged down a taxi and made it! Which worked out in our favour. We arrived around 2:30 and had the place all to ourselves! Adam got us situated and Carlos took us to the first big cave. It was amazing being in there by ourselves with the piece and quiet. The waters were cool and we explored all around. We were then taken to the second cave where you can swim to a secret cave! This was an awesome experience having this other world to ourselves. I highly recommend going after the rush, about 2-3pm. That way you still have 1:30 mins to explore. The price is well worth it, and if you didn't bring an underwater flashlight, they have everything you need. And it's worth the price. Thanks to Carlos for taking us through and Adam for saving us by driving us back to town! You guys rock! If you go by taxi, make sure you get them to come back at least 2 hours later. You seriously HAVE to go! And thanks again to Adam for the tips on more things to do in playa on the cheap."

Had researched it before hand on TA and thought I had seen the cost was about $100 pesos pp. Well, i was wrong..it is 200 pesos per person. Also we knew to bring our own snorkeling stuff but one of the group did not. It cost her about 50 pesos for the mask and snorkle. However, the guy at the cenote was telling us that the underwater flashlight would be 30 pesos; the locker was 20 pesos and i can't remember what the guide would cost. He told us we could have all the above for 260 pesos each (including the guide) but once we told him we did not need certain things he broke it down to \"ala carte\" prices. The first cenote is awesome! it is literally in a cave, which is very dark, but for a couple of lights. When we went there was no one else there (about 11:30am) and it was a little spooky..there were some bats flying around us. It is circular fresh water. Great experience. The second cenote has a small opening which you could see the sky outside. This one was larger then the first but there was alot of parts you really could not swim in. There was heavy \"muck\" in those places. As long as you stay where the ropes are you will be fine. Really interesting and highly recommended. My only issue is that when we went last year to the Gran Cenote (outside Tulum) it was larger and able to swim all over it for approx 100 pesos. The guy told us the \"prices\" went up last november. There is also a dry cave you can explore, we did not as we really just wanted to do swimming."

            "review": "Unbelievable!!!. Before our family vacationed in Mexico, we researched interesting things to do in the Playa del Carmen area. We came across reviews for Chaak Tun. We read that most hotel staff and taxi drivers would not even know where it was... TRUE. We read that it is off the bumpiest road in Mexico... TRUE. We read that it was not to be missed... VERY, VERY TRUE!!! Amazing doesn't even cover it! We were taken to three cenotes (basically sinkholes). Two of them are filled with water and are absolutely breath-taking! We had Adam as our guide. He was very fun and knowledgeable. He had us rub decomposed limestone on our faces as a facial... But it didn't stop there! In the next cenote he presented us with our pedicures... little guppies nibbling at our toes! (Beware ladies... do not let your husbands claim this as your spa day, as mine tried!) I was so worried about what types of life forms we would encounter... We saw bats (we didn't bother them / they didn't bother us), some catfish, tiny guppies, a cricket... That was pretty much it! We searched for \"Lupita\" - a cricket-eating spider, but did not find her. I was okay with that! :) To get to the last part of the tour, we had to swim underwater from one cave to the next! It wasn't difficult to do, only a few seconds underwater. My 6 and 8 year olds did it easily with Adam's guidance. Getting to swim into a \"secret cave\" was one of the highlights of their trip! The only sketchy thing was that their bathroom facility was currently enjoying a facelift... I'm sure it will be beautiful upon our next visit!The total cost of our self-made excursion was $120 for our family of four. This included entrance to the cenotes (discounted for the children) and a taxi ride. We negotiated that the taxi driver stayed while we visited, so it cost a little more than normal. It was only about a 20 - 25 minute ride there.Be sure to take bug spray for the part of the tour. The mosquitoes in Mexico are no joke! I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars!"

But, the base cost for people not in a tour (which are usually overpriced) has doubled from $100 pesos a person to $200 a person. It\u2019s still $100 pesos if you can prove you live or work in Playa.The guy at the desk said it was orders from the new management/owners. And, he didn't budge and inch on negotiation. With a clear tone of \u201ctake it or go F yourself\u201d. For Quintana Roo his behavior was very aggressive, and I\u2019m saying this as a two year resident of Mexico on my 3rd trip to the state. It is especially weird because the guides who work there are quite friendly and helpful.It\u2019s sad because this is now the most expensive \"non-tour\" Cenote in the Yucatan with no amenities! No snack bar. No beverages except those provided with a guide package. Not sure what the new owners are thinking, but repeat business doesn\u2019t seem to be a concern.If you just have time for one cenote and don't care about the cost. It's a good choice, but there are a dozen other great ones usually costing $50 to $100 pesos, with much better service and less hassle."

We were the only family there (we got there about 10am) and it was a personal, one-on-one experience as opposed to the \"theme park\" experiences of the larger cenotes. This is the real deal.

The cenote people will call a taxi for the return, but it costs 150 pesos because its a callout.We took the guided tour just for the 2 of us, and were pleased we did - another group went through with about 20 people and was very regimented. We went through small passages and into very small caves so you have to be prepared to do it.Our guide gave us lots of information and was careful as well so we didn't feel worried at any stage.

If you pay when you get to the cenote, he may not return, and you won't have a way back.) Our front desk clerk Louis at Aventura Mexicana was most helpful. It took him 15 minutes & 4 cabs to get one to finally agree to it. The road to the cenote is under construction. The cenote cost $20.00 each and included entry, helmet & life vest. You can rent a flashlight for $6.00 ( called gringo tax ) or $8. to buy, (or bring your own!) Did not get one but Juan our guide had one. Do not really need snorkel equipment. We had equipment, but never used it. No flippers allowed. We were the only people there. We used Juan as our guide & tipped him $10.00 U. S.- well worth it. Can't stress how important a guide is. You will miss a lot without one. If you go, ask for Juan. He speaks perfect English and has a real love and enthusiasm for nature, which is infectious. No pictures allowed as it can harm the habitat, birds, bats etc. Strongly suggest water shoes or flipflops or something on your feet. Just the walk from 1 cenote to the other will cut & bruise bare feet."

Even tho we only swam in the first cave, we thought it was worth the 200 pesos, just for the pictures and the experience. You're given a snorkel, helmet, and vest.

In our family we have children who are ages 7-13 and all of them loved the cenote. If you are looking to save money I would recommend bringing your own snorkel gear if possible as they did charge a large amount for snorkel rentals. Also I recommend getting a guide. Our guide made our experience fabulous since we learned a lot about the cenote and its formation and all the little things in the cenote which we would likely miss without a guide. This is certainly a great and local place for all who are visiting Playa and I give it 5 stars for the overall experience."

We took a taxi from Playa, he dropped us off and returned promptly in 2 hours. We got a guide based on other reviewers suggestions. Definitely get the guide! Adan was an excellent guide. He shared a lot of information about the natural and cultural history of the area, and some of this I expect from a guide. The best part though, was his conveying a little of the spiritual experience of a cenote: the quiet tranquility and total darkness of being in a cave, the respect for the creatures living there, and the beauty of it all. Thanks Adan!"

I simply could not believe what the other reviewer said about the admission price having gone up that much. I had to go there to believe it. It was true. They said they have one price of 100 pesos for local folks from Playa and 200 pesos for tourists and with equipment, which you need, the \"package\" deal is 360 pesos per person. We rejected, since we had a car and could go elsewhere.The cave and the water they showed us was nothing to write home about, no plants or fish, no colorful rocks. I have seen amazingly colorful cave formations and this did not seem to be that interesting.Getting to this place is a pain even though it is not too far from town. We went all the way up Juarez only to realize the road is closed and we have to go back, turn north east, get on constitution and basically make a 2 mile loop around to get back on that dirt road."

We had drawn a map based on google earth, so although he had not heard of it before he had no problems getting there even with Ave. Juarez construction.As noted with other reviews, this cenote is under new management. There are two entry fee levels: 200 pesos for entrance only, 360 pesos for entrance plus helmet, life jacket, flashlights, locker, and mask/snorkel. Guides are now independent contractors and work for tips.I suggest getting the full package - worth it for the flashlight alone! - and the mask/snorkel will really improve your enjoyment of the cenote. Also, you should totally spring for the guide. When we were there (Friday morning at 10 AM) there was only one other couple at the cenote. They went without the guide and ended up missing the 2nd of the 3 caves. The 2nd cave also has a very narrow passageway (maybe 3 feet tall?) which I would not have ventured through without a guide.Our guide was Carlos, who has been at this cenote for 12 years. His English was good, he was fun and friendly, and very patient with this family of four.We really debated coming here - the entrance fee seemed a bit steep - but are SO glad we did! This is unlike any other cave that we have seen. My daughter was not excited about coming (nervous of a small cave, hates cold water), but she ended up enjoying it and was happy throughout the tour.We wore our wetsuits and sport sandals. While the water seemed warmer to me than snorkeling in the ocean, you are in the water a long time here. If you have wetsuits bring them; they have a nice changing / bathroom area. Sport sandals were not required, but you are going to be walking over uneven and rocky cave floors."

A little tough to get to as Avenue Juarez has been closed for construction at the top before you arrive however approach by Consitiuyentes and take the last left across back to Juarez(Brand-new paved road) And you will be on track to get to the entrance as others have guided. Our guide told us this road will be closed for about four months. Well worth looking for though. Very intimate as it seems very few tourists make the effort to get here. Our guide, Adan was fantastic. Spoke wonderful English and had an obvious passion for the natural surroundings including the history and geology. Because of the remoteness, we were only one of three groups at the caves during the late afternoon. A very unique experience and a true trip highlight."

Ask the drivers to take you down Avenida Juarez and you will make it there.

So i was bored and rented a bike in Playa Del Carmen, took Avenida Juarez (good bike trail in center of road)- stopped by a cheap taco joint along the way, took dirt road and after 40 minutes ride was there (Entrance is on the right if you come from Playa)...it was 230 pesos (entrance fee with locker). The Cenote was empty around 12 that day and I liked that i had the cavern all to myself. I floated on my back watching the play of light on the stalactite filled ceiling and watched the herbivorous and insectivorous bats flitter about. it was very peaceful and almost spiritual to float in the crystal clear, cool water. Could imagine how the Maya would consider this the entrance to their underworld (Xibalba) which according to them had 9 levels with one god and lord of the underworld along with several gods of sacrifice that they placated by throwing humans and trinkets for things they needed in ancient times. Seems like they still do throw things as i found a modern day statue thrown in and was resting at the bottom of the clear pool i was swimming in. The guy at the gate told me that up until about 2 years ago local people did use the cenote to make offerings for good luck or wishes wanted to be granted. Tip-take a waterproof flashlight...this cenote is pretty extensive and has two large caves (one to right of entrance down dirt road is the nicest and biggest one) without a guide you definitely will need a flashlight to navigate the dark passageways safely. There is some lighting."

The water is not as cold as I imagined after reading reviews but do wear a couple of layers to keep some body heat in and wear water shoes.

Don't miss the part where you go through a short tunnel with a few inches between your face and the ceiling into darkness (torch needed!) then further into an sun filled open Cenote!

It is quite an experience to swim through the remarkably clear, quiet, stalactite/mite laden recesses of the two Chaak Tun caverns.Everyone there and was so accommodating. Our guide, Carlos, was knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and amiable. One of the high points was when he asked us (my wife and two sons) whether we were interested in experiencing a few moments of total silence and darkness. When we consented, he switched off the lighting (appropriately scant to begin with), and we stood together in silence, ensconced in the novelty of perfectly silent, perfectly dark, primordial immersion.Here are my suggestions to maximize the experience:1. As others have suggested, arrive in the afternoon (1:30pm or later) to minimize the number of fellow explorers. We actually arrived at 3:15 and still had the full, two hour experience even though they technically closed at 4:30.2. If you can, wear 1) a wetsuit, and 2) water shoes. Don\u2019t hesitate to go if you don\u2019t have access to either of these items, but either will increase your comfort since the water is on the cool side and the rocks are a bit uncomfortable in parts. Again, these were minor challenges, but worth counteracting if possible.3. If you are bringing your own snorkel equipment, leave the fins at home; you can\u2019t use them because of the potential damage to the formations.4. You can and should rent at least one waterproof flashlight for your group. We rented one, but probably should have rented two.5. Pay for a guide; it\u2019s totally worth the 100 pesos.6. Bring some dry clothes to change into and store these clothes and valuables in a locker. We only needed to rent a single locker for 4 people.Finally, I\u2019ve read many of the posts complaining about the price changes and I would like to add my perspective. I talked to the onsite operations manager, and it\u2019s clearly a simple case of miscommunication. The cenote management changed recently and, not atypically, the prices changed as well. Because it\u2019s a small staff, with limited English and likely limited resources, these changes were not publicized nor were the adverse posts addressed. But I strongly believe they are not trying to deceive or \u201crip-off\u201d anyone. Enjoy!"

It is actually 200 pesos if you have your own gear which we did. We did have one person that had to pay the full 360 pesos to rent their gear. There were six in our group. We had Adam guide us through the Cenote. There are actually two different cenotes that you can visit. We absolutely loved his guided tour. If we would have done this on our own without a guide it wouldn't have been the same experience at all. We went deep into the caves and actually had only a couple of inches between us and the ceiling in some areas as we swam from room to room. I would recommend this to anyone in the area but only if you have the guide. That made all the difference in the world. Also, about the road.... very bumpy and quite a ways away from civilization. Just keep driving away from the Ocean (west) down Avenue Bonita Juarez. Eventually the road turns to dirt. Then you pass through a security check point. Just keep going. Finally, the road has a very small bend in an otherwise straight road. When it bends, you are there. I am guessing it is 5-7 km from the highway. Enjoy!"

This road you will follow all the way north untill the asphalt road stops (it stops beside the collega MayaLand). From here you will enter a sandy road. This road you will need to continu for approximately 2km. Than the cenote is found on your right hand.The cenote itself is beautiful and very quite (in total you will find 2 cenotes and 1 dry cenote / cave). For example we were there as the only 4 persons. When we left 5 others came.Price:Locals pay 50 pesos to enterForeigners pay 100 pesos TIP: DON'T go here by tour, they may charge you crazy amounts of money and the staff (1 old man) are extremely helpful (the only disadvantage is that he doesn't speak english)"

Started off with arriving in the jungle with a walk through and the lovely guide Flavio giving a heart-felt passionate feel of the jungle including a stop for us all to listen quietly to soak up the surroundings and sounds. This followed with an amazing snorkel in the first cave like Cenote with the most amazing crystal sparkling sapphire coloured water with crystal visability of the caves under the water. The second snorkel was of a more open Cenote. After a lovely snack offered of bananas, cake, sweets, drinks and a shower we were back in the comfortable shuttel to the beach to snorke with the turtles in their natural environment. A truly fantastic experience and wonderful service from beginning to end."

            "review": "Beautiful, Quiet, Cavern Cenote. If you are looking for a more rustic, less touristic, cavern type cenote, Chaak Tun is an excellent choice. For $10 you will get a cave tour and a chance to swim or snorkel in the cenote. The guides spoke some English and were very helpful. We brought our own snorkel equipment, but rentals are available for snorkel as well as underwater flashlight rentals (much recommended). The water is clear, clean and cool and it is really fun to swim over the interesting cave formations. The drive to the cenote can be tricky so it is best to have your GPS coordinates marked before going out there. Also, it can get crowded with the jeep tours, so afternoons are really a better choice. Between the tours, we pretty much had the place to ourselves. A couple of important things to know before you go: 1. They ask that you do not use sunscreen or insect repellent as it disturbs the delicate ecosystem in the cenote. 2. Some of the passages are a little tighter (not for the claustrophobic) but you still have the option of remaining in the more open areas to swim."

I definitely recommend water shoes for the walk down and for exploring in the cave. It wasn't busy at all and we were the only group down there the whole time we were snorkelling. I highly encouraged others to try this tour!"

I would recommend renting the snorkel gear so you can see the beauty underwater. I loved this place, it was amazing! It truly is a hidden gem."

We were not sure what to expect when we rented a scooter and headed out to Cenote Chaak-Tun (despite the lack of directions to Chaak-Tun online, it is very easy to find. Take Benito Juarez away from the ocean, continue about 10-15 minutes after you go under highway 307 and it will be on your right hand side); but we were truly blown away. We chose Chaak-Tun over the much other more touristy options in the area because we like our independence and didn't want to be forced to go with a large group. We also didn't like all the rules that many of the other cenotes had (for eg. no photos \"in order to protect the cenotes\" aka so they can sell the overpriced photos that their photographer takes). Chaak-Tun was the PERFECT pick for us. When we arrived, there was only one other family. By the time we were ready to enter the water, the family was on their way and we then had the entire cenote to ourselves for over an hour! (We went at about 3pm). It was so, so relaxing and magical. The man who runs Chaak-Tun was wonderful. He was more than willing to guide us through, but when he found out we preferred to do our own thing, he allowed us complete independence. He also gave us a great deal on the snorkel equipment and underwater flashlights and went above and beyond to take care of little details.Thanks for the wonderful experience!"

            "review": "Our favorite cruise shore excursion. My wife, two grandchildren and I recently went to Chaak Tun cavern and cenote as a shore excursion from a Carnival Dream cruise that included Cozumel. Of all of our activities, this turned out to be our favorite. We did it as part of a Jeep and Cavern excursion. Since the ship docks at Cozumel and this excursion starts with a 45 minute ferry ride to Playa del Carmen which isn't exciting and can be a little rough if the seas are rough. Sea sickness is a possiblity. Once in Playa del Carmen, we met our guides \"Andy\" and Isaac. Andy was very funny while being informative and safety concious. The jeeps are four passenger with manual transmissions, so to drive you need a valid drivers license and able to drive a stick shift. The roofs are down, so expect a lot of sun and wind. Bring eco friendly sun screen and insect repellent. The jeep drive to the cavern is mostly zig zagging along city streets with the final stretch down a very bumpy and muddy dirt road. Bring bathing suit, water shoes and dry clothes to wear after the cavern. There is a changing area, lockers to rent and snorkel sets to rent if you don't bring your own. At the cavern they give you time to change before and after. You are given a hard hat to wear while walking in the cavern. Wear it. I bumped my head at least 5 times. Once you reach the underground river, you put on life vest and snorkels if you want to snorkel and jump in the beautiful green water. The water is 72 degrees and is up to 50 feet deep in spots. The guide tours you around various areas, lets you do a facial with the mineral rich bottom sedimen and then gives you about 20 minutes to snorkel and explore on your own. It is wonderful and exhilerating. After changing clothes the jeeps head for a beach where you can buy lunch at a restuarant. Bring cash or cresit card. Good food at a moderately high price. You have about an hour at the beach. Then jeep back to Playa del Carmen and the ferry ride back to the ship."

The stalagmites and stalagtites are stunning. Seeing the fruit bats hanging and the catfish swimming imersre you in this reality that we aren't the only ones enjoying this cave.We got a private tour from Carlos because it was a rainy slow day for them and it was totally worth it.

            "review": "Hidden gem right in Playa del Carmen. We had swam in a few different cenotes on the last trip, and this year we had brought friends for their first time who also wanted to go. With only one week in town our schedule was pretty full with visits to Akumal, Tulum, and Cozumel, and we just didn't have time to fit in a cenote while on the go. But, I had remembered there was a cenote right in Playa, just on the other side of Juarez and it had great reviews, so we thought this was a great chance to have our cenote experience without leaving town. We grabbed a taxi from our hotel on 1st Ave and hired him to bring us there and come back to pick us up in 2 1/2 hours for a cost of $30US. On the drive there, which only took about 10 to 15 minutes, the skies opened and it started to rain...hard. We didn't mind, though, because we would be underground anyways! We didn't bother with a tour, so we only purchased the entrance, snorkels, life vests (for two of us), and a flash light. We were also given the mandatory hard hats since the entrance to one of the cenotes is quite low and it's easy to hit your head. There is a long winding path with stairs through the jungle that leads to the entrance to the first wet cenote. As I said, it was raining hard outside so it was very slippery. Once inside, though, it was great. We could see the rain coming down through one of the openings in the roof and it was so pretty. The first cenote has a winding path that leads to a dock platform with stairs into the water. Note that this is already quite deep here once you step off the last step. The water is cool and refreshing and so clear. You can see right to the bottom. There are a few small fish swimming about, but nothing to worry about. There are also some great rock formations in this cave, with lots of stalagmites and stalactites hanging about. From here you can also continue into the dry cenote for a tour, but it is dark and we decided to head to the other wet cenote instead as we were really there to cool off. To get to the other cenote you have to go back outside, pass the front gate, and walk a short path to where some more stairs lead down into the cenote. The first part of the cenote is dry and has a temezcal and alter, before leading to another platform dock. Again, the water is cool and refreshing. We had the place to ourselves on that afternoon, which was nice. Really great visit, wish I had heard about it sooner! No need to take one of those bus tours to a crowded cenote an hour or more away when you can just head across town. Go. Enjoy."

The price was reasonable too The stalactites and stalagmites are nothing in comparison to something like Luray Caverns in West Virginia, but being that most readers are not likely to see that, this is still enjoyable. There were a few things that could have made the experience better:-our guide did not speak any English short of \"watch your head\" or \"swim here\". I really wished we had a guide who could really explain to us what we were looking at. I get that they are limestones formations that are millions of years old, but later we met someone who was really knowledgable and told us how they were formed and how they were all connected etc.-you are given one handheld flashlight for two people to share. I think everyone should get an overhead flashlight of good quality. -they don't give you flippers and that would have made swimming through easier since you already had the life vest and snorkel gear."

My teenage son liked this adventure the best of all the things we did on our vacation. Bring your swim suit and I recommend some shoes that you can swim with (not flip flops), otherwise you can swim barefoot, which is ok, but the cave floor is rough at parts. There are several caves to explore. We saw lots of beautiful formations, interesting roots coming into the cave, a ritualistic Mayan sauna, and lots of fruit bats hanging from the ceiling. A majority of your exploring will be in the water, which was cool, but refreshing. Many parts are too deep to touch the bottom, so life jackets are provided. There is a place to set down your camera while you are swimming, so it's ok to bring a small camera into the caves, but have something to put it in to keep it dry.To get there, we took a cab ride from downtown Playa del Carmen which cost us 100 pesos, plus a tip. Drive on Juarez Avenue all the way to the end until you come to a checkpoint with a guard where the land is private property from that point. Our cab driver told him we were going to the cenote and let us through. From there it was about a mile or so on a very bumpy dirt road through mostly jungle to get to the site which is marked well with a big sign (see photo). Getting home when we were finished was a little tricky. They couldn't (or wouldn't?) call a cab for us, so we began to walk back down the dirt road to town where we though we'd pick up a cab there. Luckily there were a few cabs headed back to town from further up the road, and one picked us up so we didn't have to walk very far at all. Just be prepared to walk in case you're not as lucky!We paid the entrance fee of $10 US dollars each, plus more to rent snorkel gear and/or a waterproof flashlight. You definitely need at least one flashlight in your party because many parts of the cave are not lit, and it's fun shining the light under the beautiful water. My son got the snorkel gear, but the rest of us did not. It was very fun either way, just a preference if you want to see under the water.The restrooms had running water and working toilets where you can change into your swimsuits. Make sure everyone in your party uses the restroom before you go down into the caves. Everyone will be given life-jackets and helmets. Helmets are for the first cave and life jackets are for the next two.I recommend going in the afternoon when there are not as many tour groups there. There was only one group of about 20 people there from a cruise ship when we arrived about 2pm, but I understand that it is much more crowded in the mornings with groups. We had the last cave all to ourselves and we swam and explored and had a wonderful time. We spent about two hours there total. The people were friendly, but we could only find one who spoke English well enough to tell us where to go and what to see. He was extremely helpful and took us through each of the caves. This is a perfect excursion for a hot afternoon when you want to cool off. I would not recommend this activity for very small children who cannot swim, or who are afraid of the dark. Older kids who can swim will have a great time. The caves were beautiful and definitely worth visiting, especially if you are staying in Playa del Carmen since it was right there in town."
