Conhecer Buenos Aires sob uma \u00f3tica fora dos tradicionais pontos tur\u00edsticos da cidade foi uma experi\u00eancia que valeu por dois motivos: 1) Excelente custo benef\u00edcio: Principalmente se for levado em considera\u00e7\u00e3o que um fot\u00f3grafo profissional acompanha todo o tour fazendo fotos dos participantes, enviado-as posteriormente via email, sem custo adicional. 2) Conhecer a hist\u00f3ria por tr\u00e1s dos fatos, com excelentes explica\u00e7\u00f5es em portugu\u00eas atrav\u00e9s do T\u00falio e do Vin\u00edcius que demonstraram dom\u00ednio e bons conhecimentos sobre a cidade e os locais visitados!!!"

Como foi minha primeira visita \u00e0 cidade, optei por fazer os passeios \"Buenas Noches\", que consiste em mostrar a cidade \u00e0 noite, e \"Lado B\", que mostra lugares quase nada explorados pelas ag\u00eancias tur\u00edsticas locais. Desde meu primeiro contato at\u00e9 o recebimento das fotos do \u00faltimo passeio, percebi seriedade, organiza\u00e7\u00e3o e comprometimento de todos. Recomendo fortemente para quem for pela primeira vez, assim como para quem j\u00e1 foi \u00e0 cidade, pois tenho certeza de que vai se surpreender, principalmente pelo \"Lado B\". Como adoro um bom papo sobre hist\u00f3ria, arquitetura e pol\u00edtica, ambos os passeios foram um prato cheio! Pena que quem estava comigo nessa n\u00e3o se mostrava l\u00e1 muito interessado nesses aspectos... Mas tudo bem, s\u00e3o pontos de vista diferentes, e \u00e9 a\u00ed que est\u00e1 a gra\u00e7a de uma boa viagem.

Durante esse tour, o Henderson (o guia do tour noturno E excelente fot\u00f3grafo) faz v\u00e1rias fotos bacanas dos participantes que s\u00e3o enviadas posteriormente.

O guia brasileiro nos explicou muitas coisas bacanas de Buenos Aires que eu nem imaginava que existia. No final do tour fomos para um restaurante que fica no \u00faltimo andar de um pr\u00e9dio bem alto, onde \u00e9 possivel ver Buenos Aires de cima.

Mas mesmo com a chuva o passeio foi \u00f3timo, principalmente porque nos levaram em um bairro super legal, bem longe dos pontos tur\u00edsticos, onde tinha o maior grafite do mundo. O tour passa por v\u00e1rios pontos bacanas da cidade onde nos contam hist\u00f3rias muito interessantes, que n\u00e3o conhecer\u00edamos como um turista normal.

Sempre bom ficar com os contatos deles e confirmar se vai ocorrer mesmo o Tour pois, ao que me parece, a Equipe e n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito grande e \u00e9 como se fosse uma atividade secund\u00e1ria de todos eles, ent\u00e3o parece que nem sempre tem gente pra substituir caso algo saia do previsto. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao tour Lado B ele \u00e9 satisfat\u00f3rio, nada de extraordin\u00e1rio, mas vale a pena pelas curiosidades que eles contam."

Os dois tour s\u00e3o excelentes e os guias conhecem muito a cidade e s\u00e3o extremamente simp\u00e1ticos, fizemos o tour \"Buenas Noches\" com o Henderson e o Vinicius que estava de apoio no dia pois havia uma pessoa com defici\u00eancia f\u00edsica na Van. Esse foi um ponto bem positivo ao meu ver pois vi a preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o dos guias com a mesma e como foram sol\u00edcitos do inicio ao fim do tour com todos. J\u00e1 o guia do Lado B foi o pr\u00f3prio T\u00falio, uma pessoa extremamente educada e que durante todo o tour nos apresentou pontos de turismo que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o muito conhecidos mas como ele mesmo diz, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o menos importantes dos demais.

Fizemos no primeiro dia e \u00e9 legal para voc\u00ea ter j\u00e1 uma no\u00e7\u00e3o da cidade. Fica um gostinho de \"quero mais\" de alguns lugares para descer e visitar com mais calma, mas \u00e9 s\u00f3 voc\u00ea se programar e ir nos que mais gostou em outros dias. Esse tour \u00e9 muito mais visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o e admira\u00e7\u00e3o da cidade vista com outra ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o do que realmente conhecer o lugar mais profundamente. Minha dica \u00e9 para levar muitos casacos, luvas , gorros para que o frio e vento da noite n\u00e3o fa\u00e7a das paradas um sofrimento de frio.A \u00fanica coisa que acho que os meninos devem repensar nesse tour \u00e9 a parada final. Apesar da vista do alto da cidade, o restaurante \u00e9 muito chique, com pessoas mais de idade e aparentemente \"frescas\" jantando e que inibem as pessoas do tour de chegar perto das janelas para tirar foto, de andarem pelo restaurante e de conversarem alto. Chegamos com uma energia nesse \u00faltimo ponto e quando subimos parece que a energia \"murchou\". Tanto \u00e9 que v\u00e1rias pessoas v\u00e3o embora assim que brindam, porque o lugar n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada convidativo. Ent\u00e3o, para ficar perfeito deveria mudar esse restaurante para um local mais descolado, pre\u00e7o acess\u00edvel e mais a cara dos brasileiros e dos pr\u00f3prios portenhos."

Naquele momento que nos apresentamos, j\u00e1 estava agradecendo pelo lindo dia que ter\u00edamos pela frente. Como tenho dificuldades com longas dist\u00e2ncias e subidas, fiquei muito preocupada, mas logo relaxei, pois tudo seria maravilhoso. E n\u00e3o \u00e9 que foi mesmo? Conheci lugares que jamais teria ido se fosse em outros grupos. E uma coisa linda foi que t\u00ednhamos fot\u00f3grafo acompanhando. Pode ter certeza que as melhores fotos que tenho foram as que a Aires Buenos me proporcionou. E nem preciso confessar que as dicas que me deram para prosseguir meus lindos dias na cidade foram muito bem aproveitadas. Queria ter feito o passeio da noite, mas na \u00e9poca que eu estava n\u00e3o tinha data. Espero voltar logo a Buenos Aires, e com toda certeza farei novos passeios e sempre estarei indicando a Aires Buenos Tour. Confesso que se pudesse estaria a\u00ed trabalhando com voc\u00eas. Sucesso T\u00falio, Henderson e Cia."

However, in the Buenos Aires Concierge Website the price is still listed as $30 per hour. There is apparently a large discrepancy between what it actually charges vs. what is published on the TripAdvisor Website. So beware...you may end up paying more than what you think you are signed-up for.

We wanted to see Tango dancing that day but were tired and didn't want to do the late night tourist thing. So she took us to a local \"milonga\" where the locals danced for their pleasure and not for the tourists. The next day she set up a city tour to see the attractions we specified, e.g. Recoleta Cemetary, Plaza de Mayo Square, San Telmo and La Boca. Then transfers back to the ship. Overall a very pleasant two days with outstanding tour guides. I would not hesitate to recommend BA Concierge!"

They responded quite promptly with all the rates I had requested and a very full and thorough explanation of the walking tour we were interested in. We were given the name and mobile phone number of the guide and were told where she would meet us and that we would pay at the end of the tour. Any company which only makes me pay at the end will get my business! We were on a cruise so Valeria, our guide, met us at the designated time at the pier and off we went. We took a public bus, taxis and the subte (subway) and Valeria always asked us what we wanted to do and gave us options so we could decide. We were able to visit all the sites we were interested in and she was very friendly and knowledgeable and gave us time to explore and take photos. She even took us to Hard Rock Cafe at our request to buy some souvenirs. We felt very safe, were not tired at all at the end and even stopped at Cafe Tortoni for chocolate and churros. The walking tour for 2 people (so it was private) cost us $30 dollars per hour plus transportation and food. We stayed with Valeria for 5 hours and it was well worth it! If you are ever in Buenos Aires do not hesitate to contact this company as they are very professional! If we are ever back in BA we will surely contact them again. Thanks again Ayelen and Valeria for making our stay so pleasant!"

We took a taxi and met Clemencia at the Recoleta Cemetery. She was pleasant and knowledgeable and with very good English, provided us with interesting information about her city. After doing very similar walking tours in other Sth American, US, Asian & European cities, we found this service comparatively expensive; however we do acknowledge that it was a private tour. Half way through the 4 hr tour, Clemencia mentioned that BA Concierge would be expecting US dollars in cash and that left us distracted and concerned about how we were going to pay her as there was no other option provided! It was assumed we would have US dollars on us even though we're from Australia! In our many years of travelling, we've never encountered such an attitude. We just presumed we would pay in local currency or even a direct transfer option. Anyway, when she realised we were annoyed that the email didn't make the payment arrangements clear, so she phoned the management of this tour operation and we came to an agreed solution. Maybe that coloured our view of things but we got the impression that even though Clemencia was University educated, there were gaps in understanding of some worldwide issues and hardships and it was probably better for her not to comment on some issues she knew little about. For example, the ivory trade - I looked in a window and was stunned to see walking sticks for sale with large ivory handles - she thought that acceptable. Her political views were also best left out of our discussions as well - her background was clearly very different to ours so again that probably coloured our impression of things. The tour came to a very abrupt end when she looked at her watch and said \"that will be 4 hours up now, any questions?\" - we asked about light lunch places and we were told \"lots of restaurants across the road\". On bidding her farewell a couple of minutes later, we crossed the road to find there was one quite formal restaurant - we had asked her about places for a sandwich or similar. We then walked for about 20 min until we finally found a suitable place. So it felt rushed at the end and we found that disappointing too. So maybe \"very good\" is a bit generous considering our experience on this occasion but other reviewers had a better experience and we had a pleasant enough day - just a bit expensive & slightly irritating at times!"

We spent two weeks in Buenas Aires in March. We hired Mariela/Buenas Aires Concierge to assist us on our first full day in the city, as we were renting a condo in a locals neighborhood. Mariela showed us around the Palermo neighborhood, helped us buy bus passes, find a SIM card for my IPhone (which was a challenge), and exchange US dollars for pesos, took us on the bus so that we felt comfortable and knew how to ride it to a number of favorite spots, and also took us on the subte.We hired her several times to give us private tours of the areas of interest in the city. But I started working with her many months before we arrived. But she was very reasonable about how she charged her time. At $25/hour, the rates are an exceptional value. Taking a tour with Mariela allows you to focus on what is of most interest to you. And the general tours are usually priced per person, making them more expensive than hiring Mariela and her group of Buenos Aires Concierges. she also gave us a list of the many attractions worth seeing, after receiving info from me via e-mail. So we then focused on some of the items on that list and were able to develop a reasonable list. There is just so much to do in Buenos Aires that it's impossible to cover it all in only two weeks. The other advantage is that Mariela told us about a few activities that we would never find on a tourists website. For example, there was a one time Barrista's competition at her favorite cafe while we were in town. We went to it and met Mariela there and watched Barristas from all around South America compete in foam art, which was really fun. We were the only gringos at the competition in one of the hip cafes near the Evita Museum.Hire Buenas Aires Concierge if you plan to visit the city, especially if you will be staying in a private home where you won't have a hotel concierge. You will not be sorry and Mariela and her team of concierges will make your trip much easier."

We had 5 hours together and she covered all the places I wanted to see and tailored the agenda to my requests. She helped me with my shopping by negotiating a good price with vendors. She was super knowledgeable about BA. I learned quite a bit. And she was fun and easy to be with. I felt like I was with an old friend. I could not have been more pleased with my tour. Thank you so much!"

Mariela took the time to listen to the things I wanted to see and do and then, with her extensive knowledge of the city and passion for it's history and culture, put together a great week of tours and activities for me. Typically, I do not do a lot of planning for a trip, more of a show up and wander around type of traveler, but this was easily the best trip I've ever taken thanks to Mariela. Her itinerary covered a lot of activities in a short period of time and she did a great job of keeping everything on time. She did a great job!"

From a professional perspective she is at the top of her game in every way - she knows this city inside-out and she conveys her enthusiasm and knowledge of her city with eloquence and good humour (she is fluent in English, Portuguese and, of course, Spanish). From a human perspective, she is a compassionate and caring human being with an abundance of integrity ......my husband was not well and she went out of her way to help us. We had to cut short our time with her and she insisted on refunding us for the hours we were not able to use - we truly appreciated this gesture. She is well-travelled and able to share reference points and comparators from other cities and countries. For anyone with restricted mobility, Mariela teams up with her colleague Juan who acts as the driver in a disability friendly motor vehicle. Mariela responded to our e-mails immediately and patiently answered all questions we had in our preparation and planning for our trip. Indeed, she gave generously of her time and her knowledge. Mariela's fees are very reasonable and our time with her represented excellent value for money, especially because we were not in BA for long and wanted to make the most of our trip. I have utilised tour guides in many parts of the world and I can endorse Mariela 100%."

Mariela was exactly the right answer for us and gave a tour our first day in BA. She is so friendly and easy to be around, it was like walking around with a friend. She knew so much about the history of Buenos Aires and current affairs. When we were hungry, she knew a perfect little empanada spot to pop into. She was also a great resource for restaurants, bars, etc- we loved her recs! She answered all our email questions quickly and prices were reasonable.

However, Mariela came so highly recommended we decided to take a chance - we are very very glad we did so. Mariela's involvement with us began well before our arrival in Buenos Aires via email communication seeking information as to what we were really interested in seeing, and explanations of the costs involved. Once arranged she made herself available via cell phone for us to ask questions and confirm how best to view the city. She made recommendations for us to consider, but what really set her apart from other tour services was her sincere desire to assist us in having a good time while in Buenos Aires. We were there during Christmas, and without any compensation at all she provided us with restaurants that were open for the holidays, she even helped us with arranging our bookings (again I want to stress that she did so before we had paid her.) For our tour she arrived on time at our apartment, had arranged car transportation to various areas of the city where we would then walk to see the sites, the car would be waiting to go to the next area after our walk. The combination of car and walking allowed us to maximize seeing as much as possible, and also allowed us to cool off during sites (Buenos Aires in December was 90 degrees and very humid!) Mariela communicated well, spoke excellent English, knew the history of the sites she showed us, but most of all had a real passion for her city and her business. At one point my father said she had a knack for picking up on what interested us the most \"our style\" and she adjusted the tour accordingly as we went. When not on vacation I am a business man who travels extensively, so I am aware of what elements quality service consist of. Mariela could easily handle family, group, and individual business tours as she is a natural at her job, and her fees are extremely reasonable. We will definitely use her again when we go back to Buenos Aires."

She booked our airport transfers which worked well. She also booked 2 private tours with Clemencia \u2013 a morning tour and an evening tour. For both tours, Clemencia met us at our hotel and we travelled by taxi to various places of interest. At these we had a bit of a walk around while Clemencia told us about the history. She also provided lots of information while we were travelling in the taxis. We especially enjoyed the night tour as she was able to show us how different BA looks after dark. We would probably not have been confident to go out on our own at that time so it was great to have someone who knew where it was safe to be. Everything went really well and we really enjoyed Clemenicia\u2019s company. One thing to remember if you are doing a taxi based tour (or the night tour that includes dinner) is to take sufficient Pesos to pay for the taxis etc. You might like to check before the tour to see about how much you will need."

A month later and nothing but static, alarm bells started ringing. So I contacted Mariela in order to have a local to check the situation out. Truth be told I was hoping that having someone go to the store would be harder to ignore than yet another email from the English chap half a world away. Even though this was somewhat of an odd request she got involved and within 4 emails had contacted the store, overcome the language barrier, and my shoes (which if I am being honest I thought were never going to arrive) were in the post and I'm writing this review having just received them.

Buenos Aires was only a stopover for me as this was a trip to Antarctica. I had one afternoon to visit some of the highlights of Buenos Aires. My Spanish is non-existent and I was hesitant to tour on my own. I was impressed from the first email - quick response, friendly, helpful. Then after I arrived, right from the introductions I knew I would have a wonderful time. Mariela is friendly and personable, and very knowledgeable. She adapted our plans easily when the protests affected our taxi plans, and she involved me in the animated taxi driver's conversation which was fun! And of course, as well as having a wonderful time, I learned about some of the history of BA, how its citizens live, and its wonderful sights. We had hot chocolate and churros in Cafe Tortoni, visited Caminito, and had a wonderful stroll through Recoleta Cemetery. I would not hesitate to recommend Mariela - my only regret is that I didn't have more time - I could have easily spent days chatting and visiting around Buenos Aires."

I contracted Mariela to act as a professional concierge for a business trip to Buenos Aires. It was an usual request in that I needed her to arrange meetings with nightlife venue owners and Argentinian lifestyle experts. During my trip she acted as my translator, personal advisor, and overall BA immersion expert. Mariela has an incredible knowledge of the city and amazing personal contacts. She seemingly knows everyone and everything in Buenos Aires. She has phenomenal recommendations for cafes, restaurants, bars, clubs, fitness facilities and more cultural pursuits. Please note that this is not meant to be hyperbole. I\u2019ve used concierge services for similar projects in other cities and, without a doubt, she is the best I have ever come across. Mariela is not only great at what she does but, she is also incredibly personable and an absolute pleasure to be around. By the end of your trip, you will likely want to include her in your plans simply because you enjoy her company. Highly, highly recommended\u2026"

We wanted lectures by professors in economics and history, given in our hotel over breakfast. We wanted tours of various parts of BA. We wanted to go a bit faster, then a bit slower. We wanted to eat and drink and rest. And on our last day, after we had said good bye to Mariela, we needed more advice, guidance, and phone calls made, and she cheerfully answered her texts and delivered what we needed. Truly, she made a huge difference to our stay in BA.One of the service providers who was inexperienced quoted us a price which we accepted (from Canada, because it seemed reasonable), which ended up looking too expensive once we got to BA. Mariela, on her own initiative, bargained him down after we had received his presentation and paid him, and the next day showed up with a refund that she got from him without ever being asked by us.When Mariela gave us tours, she was well-informed, professional, and presented very well. For example, I\u2019ve been to the Recoleta cemetery several times in the passed and still missed out on a lot of the interesting sights that Mariela pointed out to us.Mariela charges by the hour for her tours, and given the quality, the price seemed exceptionally reasonable. In addition, she provided information, help, support, translation, arrangements, often via telephone, email or text, all without any additional charge.She really went above and beyond what we expected."

One of the highlights for me since I am a ballroom and tango dancer, was the personal recommendations for tango schools, teachers and the best Milongas. She even helped make appointments with teachers before I arrived to make sure they had time for me. I am so happy that we chose Mariela as our guide and concierge for Buenos Aires.

I just came back from a 6-city solo tour of South America (my first visit) and one of the best memories of my amazing trip was the day I had the pleasure of spending with Mariela. I engaged private guides in every city that I visited (Rio, BA, Lima, Santiago, Cuzco, Aguas Calientes) and Mariela was the best guide I had - by a wide margin. From the time that she met me at my hotel (right on time!), I had the most incredible seven hours getting to know Buenos Aires. We traversed the city by taxi, subway, bus and on foot to see the key sights (Recoleta, San Telmo, La Boca, Palermo, etc.) but what stuck with me most was the brilliant conversations that we had. Mariela gave me incredible insight into her city - what it was like to live there, the good bits, the bad bits and everything in between. I really felt as though a friend was showing me around her home city and this gave me an appreciation for Buenos Aires that I could not have experienced any other way. She recommended a great place for lunch (I can't remember the name), brought me to the city's most famous cafe for delicious coffee and pointed out fun facts and sights at every other street corner we passed. I had a great time and would recommend her to anyone visiting Buenos Aires who wants to see a side of the city that you would never experience through a guidebook or bus tour. Thanks Mariela!"

She is intelligent, honest, good humoured and very aware for our safety. We met at the cemetery and her immense knowledge made this an amazing experience (we later found we knew far more than other visitors who had just accessed Evita's mausoleum). We walked and used the underground to access the main attractions, punctuated with wonderful cafe stops and the itinerary included El Ateneo (library in a theatre), which we would not have thought of. We then took a taxi to save time to be able to explore the colourful and exciting La Boca. M ticked all the boxes, she even made reservations for our evening meal and gave fine wine recommendations.

We observed the locals dance a variety of tango routines. The professional dancers which came out later were impressive.

Within a half hour of my email, she sent me a detailed itinerary that was fit-for-purpose to my requested duration and location.The tour itself was fantastic. Mariela's comprehensive knowledge of the city and its landmarks coupled with being culturally and socially in-the-know made for a truly unique experience. I originally had planned for a 3 hour tour; I ended up enjoying the insider's guide to BA so much that we ended up going an additional 2 hours (another ad-hoc decision by me that she was able to accomodate seamlessly). Logistically, she was also able to help me with money exchange and acquiring a sim card - being a non-Spanish speaker, these tasks would have taken me considerable time and stress to do independently. We got both tasks done in about 10 minutes.I realize this review is long-winded, but I felt compelled to give credit where it is due.

She's very easy to communicate with and had no problem doing reservations for us prior to our arrival and in some cases having to make last minute changes. This makes a trip to a foreign city much more comfortable when you really don't know how to budget your time for different days. Having Mariela plan every detail of your vacation makes for a very stress free visit. We met with her at The Recoleta Cemetery for a walking tour of the city. Her tidbits of information throughout the cemetery made for a very interesting tour. She is so easy to talk to, intelligent, witty, well traveled and with a very sweet disposition. We needed to change dollars and she took us to the place she knew best to get a better rate which is apparently only known by the locals, a place we would have never found on our own and the difference in the exchange was significant. That was greatly appreciated. We had coffee in one of the oldest, most traditional coffee shops in Buenos Aires and lunch in a local place in Palermo that had the most delicious food. These are things that tourists, without the benefit of a local's guidance don't get to experience.

Mariela felt like my long lost good friend from the other part of the world despite just being with her for 3 days. If you want to view the city from an exciting and refreshing perspective, go for Mariela. If you want to be introduced to this city by a friend, go for Mariela. Because as a friend, she looks out for your best interests and touches your heart in a special way. I was a solo traveler, first time traveling half the world, without any knowledge of the Spanish language and I was feeling really disconnected, lost and lonely. Mariela helped me to break into this new culture and made me feel as home. I strongly recommend her!"

She has alot of current information that are not available in guide books, etc. Very quick to respond via email and she had so much knowledge on the Recoleta Cemetery which is definitely recommended. If you need recommendations on restaurants, bars, etc. she is a wealth of information. When we return to Buenos Aires, we are definitely doing another outing with Mariela."

She was incredibly patient with my emails (more than 10 email exchanges) prior to my trip and answered all my queries succinctly. I book a day tour with her where she gave me an excellent overview of Buenos Aires taking me to the key spots and I particularly liked the local insights she provided. We had coffee at a charming cafe and lunch at this secret restaurant tucked away in a little corner. She also went the extra mile to assist with organizing a 3 day trip to Perito Moreno that occurred without a hitch. For the rest of my days, Mariela also took the time to ask me what other activities I wanted to cover e.g. shopping, tango shows, horse racing, and gave me all kinds of detailed tips to plan my entire trip. My Buenos Aires trip absolutely would not have been complete without Mariela.- Alicia"

She also has travelled a lot herself which gave good insight into comparing Argentina's sites and scenes to other places in the world.The tour price was very reasonable and only slightly more than a group bus tour. In my opinion, the value of the private tour was WAY more than a huge group tour. Also, we were able to go at our own pace. Mariela had a planned schedule and route but was willing to work with us to edit for our interests.Must book tour!!!"

Despite the wide range of interests (and ages!) amongst the three of us, we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Mariela is energetic, enthusiastic, interesting, and interested. She wanted to know what kinds of things we liked, and listened and adjusted to accomodate them. She also knew tons of \"legends\" and local stories, especially regarding Recoleta Cemetery, which added a nice local flare to the experience. Mariela provides a unique and personalized tour of Buenos Aires that actually felt more like a great conversation with a friend than a tour from a stranger. I highly recommend!"

We ended our tour in Palmero at the Botanical Gardens.Mariela provided us with insightful information about the various sites and at a pace that was comfortable for my wife and myself. Instead of lengthening her tour and charging us additional fees, she suggested that we tour the San Telmo and La Boca barrios on our own given that she felt that would work better into our schedule for the week. She also offered and followed up with information for us on other places for us to visit, polo matches, etc. that we had discussed during our day.I'd rate Mariela's tour service as good value and give her great points for treating us fairly and following up afterwards with additional information."

My daughter and I spent 9 days in Buenos Aires and wanted to see as much as we possibly could and get as much of an authentic, not too touristy experience possible. Mariela was a lifesaver and organized everything! She took quite a bit of time to get to know us and what our interests were and what might be the most enjoyable activities, sites, and restaurants during our stay. Upon meeting she immediately started making recommendations and within a couple hours of leaving her, she had already emailed me with a full itinerary, a wealth of interesting information and plenty of suggestions as to how we should spend our time in her lovely city.  She was extremely easy to deal with and had a great vibe to her. She was full of energy and had a clear passion for what she does. She so obviously wants to help people get exactly what they want out of their visit. The itineraries she set out for us were really well thought out and easy to follow, with flexible options in case we had extra energy that day or were not feeling particularly ambitious. She truly made the trip a great success! I am fluent in Spanish and had done some research before our arrival but even so, we never would have found some of the fabulous places she recommended on our own. I can honestly say that we would not have been able to see nearly as much, nor would we have enjoyed ourselves quite to the extent that we did had it not been for the Maravillosa Mariela! She takes all of the work out of it so you can just enjoy yourself and all the city has to offer."

I usually do all necessary destination research before I travel anywhere but a crazy work schedule necessitated different measures, especially as I was only going to have only 6 days in Buenos Aires. I found out about Mariela through Trip Advisor and I'm thankful that I engaged her service. She put together an itinerary of things to do, just as I\u2019d requested, providing options for both day and night. Here are the things I like about Mariela:1. Punctuality and professionalism - Mariela returned emails and calls on time and when we planned to meet she was right on time.2. Her knowledge of Buenos Aires - Now anyone can search the net and get information about a city. A couple people I know actually used someone's itinerary that was posted online. They knew of the main attractions but did not grasp what was right for them so they spent very very long days running all over the large city. With Mariela's help we were able to get the maximum value over a short time and were able to avoid the parts in which we were not interested.3. Personal touch - You know that this is not just a job. Once she figured out our needs and demographic (we are young professionals), she actually got us involved in all sorts of events, including things she attended. Translation: we got the real thing4. Commitment - even when we'd left and Mariela thought we were still there, she was sending updates on current happening events I will definitely ensure that anyone I know contacts Mariela if they are visiting Buenos Aires!"

Most importantly Laura conveyed the warmth of BA through her friendly and approachable manner, she was well informed, but it felt more like a friend of friend showing us around than a tour guide!The following day Mariela had arranged a Tango lesson for us. This was the highlight of our time in BA! The teacher Cyrena was superb and whilst we were not the most talented of Tango dancers, she certainly gave us a feel for the dance and we had a lot of fun. She even taught my 9 year old daughter the moves! Everything went completely to plan, the services on both days I found to be friendly, professional and punctual. Thanks to Mariela's wonderful expertise, we did not feel like strangers in BA!"

Boy was I wrong Mariela gave us 2 days of touring without going to the typical tourist attractions. Mariela was a pleasure to be with and gave us an insight of the country which we enjoyed. When we return in our travels Mariela will be our first call. I'm truely sorry we didn't use her on our first visit I would have enjoyed it much more. Mariela was accomodating with our schedule and surprised us with 2 wonderful restaurants for lunch. I couldn't recommend her services more highly! You won't be disappointed."

We had just finished an extended cruise in Ushuaia and was looking forward to stepping back onto terra firma. We had found Mariela through Tripadvisor prior to our trip and made all the arrangements for our one day tour. She was prompt in her responses and eventually even helped us select & book an excellent boutique hotel in Palermo (plus arrange for other walking tour guides for our next stop in Santiago, Chile).Mariela was very knowledgeable of the city, culture & its people; and we enjoyed her guiding style and pace. In fact, we felt like our niece was showing us around town. In the evening after our tour, she sent us additional suggestions & tips of other places to visit. We would recommend Mariela to anyone visiting BA without any hesitation."

We started by booking some time with her for a couple of afternoons, but soon we were happily 'addicted' to her excellent services, and in the end used her for six afternoons in total. She was incredible in every way --- truly a 'one in a million' individual. There are far too many details of her impressiveness to go into here, and in any event most of her fantastic qualities and services have already been fairly extensively gone over in other reveiws. Suffice it to say that she exhibited every quality one could ever want in a personal concierge, and both my husband and I have absolutley no hesitation in giving her our very highest recommendation. If you book her, I can promise you that you will not be sorry!"

I am ashamed to say that our trip was back in September , but if you can take my still ardent recommendation of Mariela and her services even after so much time has passed, I assure you it will not go unrewarded. First of all, being a native Latina I can tell you that Mariela's depth of knowledge, translations (for my English-speaking husband, and passion for her country and all it has to offer is genuine. This was our first time in BA and our first time using a private concierge/tour guide - and my husband (who is not usually keen on spending in this area) was impressed by Mariela and her services.Mariela took her time to explain her services and answer more than dozen question even before we landed - prior to money exchanging hands! Once we arrived she confirmed our itinerary with us and met us at our hotel. Not only did she have everything planned but she allowed flexibility for any last minute changes and \"wants.\" Even after her guided tour she gave us many recommendations on other things we wanted to do and we were so enamored by her and the wealth of knowledge we just had to have her for another day. Having Mariela at your side is like having a friend that is waiting for your arrival to show you all the sights. She puts your interests up front and has an innate sense to guide you to see knew things that will truly match your personality.Mariela knows she has won us over as clients and we cannot wait to go back and visit BA (with her at our side) again!"

Mariela also followed up later that same day with answers and suggestions to our endless questions we asked during the tour.

She started with our immediate neighborhood in Palermo, making us instantly confident about the best walking routes, buses, locals' favorites and hidden gems - then took us on an excellent city tour. It was clear that she had been thinking about us and our interests. It certainly wasn't the pre-packaged march around obvious tourist spots and 'friends where you can spend money'.Later, after I lost my iphone, she even made sure that my office IT dept was able to wipe it, and made sure I got the confirmation (going so far as to offer lending us an old phone of her own while we were here).Then, two days after our tour, she emailed us to say that, even though our dates meant we couldn't catch the big weekend polo games in the city, there was a set of private club matches at the Association of Argentinian Polo headquarters in Pilar. An exceptionally nice polo instructor took the two of us for an unforgettable afternoon there (feeling like welcome guests, mingling comfortably with the small crowds of friends and crews!).It goes to show, that if you're lucky enough to be looked after by the right people, wonderful things can happen. We'd recommend Mariela without hesitation."

Mariela (Buenos Aires Concierge) exceeds all expectations in her concern for ensuring that first-time-visitors to Buenos Aires like me will have the best possible experience in exploring the many treasures this great city has to offer. n my own case, we had planned a private tour of the city on a a day that turned out to be so rainy that it would have ruined the entire experience. It was Mariela herself who suggested that the tour day be changed to another day and gave FREE advice on what to do instead on such a rainy day, in this case a visit to the MALBA museum. And so it was all along: when I told her of my interest in attendiing a concert in the Teatro Colon, she informed me of a free matinee concert and made suggestions about what else to do afterwards, what to visit, where to eat etc. During the entire week of my stay in Buenos Aires she stayed in touch to ensure that I found things of interest to explore eventhough she did not gain a penny by giving of her own time. And not even once was I disappointed in following her advice. On the contrary, Mariela not only \"knows\" this city, she loves it passionately.I did do the city tour on another day than the one we had originally agreed upon and cancelled because of the rain. Because Mariela herself was busy with other bookings, she send another guide, a young lady by the name of Laura, in her stead. Laura turned out to be the best guide one could asked for, not only in terms of her knowledge but also in the sense of being the most pleasant person to be with for four and a half hours. There was not a minute where I was bored or did not learn something or we did no t have something to talk aboiut. Laura showed the same enthusiasm and passion for this marvellous city as her \"boss\". It was like walking the streets of Buenos Aires with a \"friend\", rather tan with a guide who was being paid for her job.  Besides the tour of the city, Mariela also suggested and booked a stunning Tango show for me. And every time, she would send an email the next day to inquire whether I had enjoyed what she had suggested. Though in the end we never met, I felt as if I had a \"guardian angel\" who ensured that as a stranger to her city I was comfortable and had a pleasant experience in visiting Buenos Aires. And that I certainly did.Mariela and Laura, thank you both so very much for the memorable visit to your beautiful city. As an independent traveller I rarely use guides or guided tours, but you both contributed immensely to my enjoyable visit to a city that on one's own can be rather overwhelming."

Day 2 - Enter LaraCecilia instructed us how and where to meet up with Lara and we met her for our tour. The tour was great. We took it a little slow (our request) because we were all a little shell shocked from last nights Shenanigans and they were very accommodating. Kudos to Lara for being able to keep 8 tall loud rowdy Americans \"boys\" in line and interested, she was great Cecilia joined us half way through and the hilarity continued. THe raucous laughter could be heard echoing through the hallways of Recoleta cemetery (a must see, I know it's a cemetery but it's still pretty cool). We made our way thorough some more of the city and ended up cutting the tour short so we could eat. They took us to this amazing steak restaurant ( steak in Argentina, hmm ). We ate drank wine and had a great time. We elected continue the tour the next day because there was so much more to see and Lara and Cecilia were insistent that we didn't miss out so they totally freed their schedules to give us the tour the next day.

We meet up with Lara who's happy to see her \"boys\" as she referred to us; and we finish the walking tour, the Pink house, some famous church, La Boca, some huge famous soccer stadium, and then this little restaurant where she made us all Matte and ate cookies. It was awesome. Cecilia met up with us from there and we hung out for a little. We went home and got dressed and Cecilia took us to the most AMAZING restaurant. The food was out of control. Great service, drinks, food.. ummm such a good night. Then Cecilia took us to another bar/lounge and we closed the night out partying like rock stars. All along the way the ladies were always very willing to shift their schedules and move things around to accommodate our curiosity about Buenos Aires. Offering to get us tickets to this if we wanted to go, or take us there if we wanted to see something, letting us know that they were proud of their city and excited to show it off. They wanted to make sure we had a great time and we enjoyed our trip and we certainly did. Thanks, so much Cecilia and Lara."

We were a group of 8 guys and considering how many different personalities Cecilia had to contend with as well as different likes and dislikes, she was amazing. First, Cecilia organized a one day walking tour with Laura. Laura was extremely knowledgeable and patient with all of us and made sure we were all entertained and made sure the pace of the tour was to our liking. Her English was also impeccable and she was also not shy to teach us common Spanish phrases. When we grew tired, she was able to schedule another day with us in order to complete the walking tour. She also asked if we preferred a fast paced tour or more of an in depth walking tour. Considering we were such a large group, we opted for a quicker paced tour and Laura was eager to oblige. We ended the tour with a group drink of yerba mate, a local herb tea that is very popular with Argentineans. Again Laura had us try different types of the mate and made sure we all got to sample the local Argentinean tradition.Cecilia also organized many dinner reservations and her restaurant choices were excellent. We enjoyed her company so much we asked her to stick around and enjoy our last evening in Buenos Aires. She not only was a great asset and guide on our trip, she became a great friend!She also arranged for a laundry service to come and pick up some clothes I had and arranged to have it dropped back off at the hotel pressed and folded. Great Service! Much cheaper than the hotels rates! Cecilia even followed back up with me after to make sure that the laundry was done to my liking.I was also traveling solo to Brazil and Cecilia said that once I arrived at my destination, If I need anything, do not be shy to email or call her and she would help me if I needed anything in RIO or Iguazu Falls. I cannot say enough about how great she was to us. We were a bunch of crazy guys on a 5 day trip through Argentina and she made sure we were all taken care of and we all had everything we needed. You cannot go wrong with hiring her.Thanks CC!"

Half way through the initial tour it started to rain and they happily agreed to continue the tour the following day. They catered the pace to what we wanted and it felt like a great friend showing you around the city. I'm not normally a big fan of tours but this was really terrific. They also went above and beyond recommending great restaurants and lounges for us to visit in the evenings. Overall it made our trip extremely enjoyable and I'd highly recommend them."

There was really something for everyone and she made sure we all got involved and had fun. Mariela was knowledgeable about every area of BA and she explained it with a sense of humbleness, humour, and pure passion for what she does.In short Mariela was absolutely delightful and a perfect host.

She is very patient, friendly and engaging, and you quickly get the sense that she's an old friend- that's how comfortable you become as she shows you the charms of Buenos Aires.

My wife, son and I had an awesome experience employing Mariela as our tour planner and tour guide during the first week of February, 2012. We learned about her in mid-December 2011 on Trip Advisor while checking for hotels in the Buenos Aires. After viewing her reviews and her web site, we decided to engage her to host a one-day tour of Buenos Aires. We exchanged several emails in making the arrangements and establishing the costs. Her fees are very reasonable and worth the cost.We decided to pay the additional modest cost of transportation for the tour in case of rain and to see more of BA. She was in constant contact with the driver which allowed for seamless transitions between walking and driving segments of the approximately 6- hour tour. The tour was a nice sampling of Buenos Aires sites and her knowledge of each of them added interest to the tour. The tour of Recoleta Cemetery was especially fascinating due to the stories she shared about many of the unbelievably ornate Mausoleum. Mariela did a nice job in being both an informational guide and an engaging, energetic host. She has a sparkling personality and was fully engaged with us during the entire tour, including being an occasional photographer along the way to capture photo-opportunity moments on our cameras. After being with her during the tour and learning a little about her family background, we can attest to her honesty and trustworthiness as a concierge and recommend her to anyone who desires a fun and informational tour of BA or other sites in Argentina.Mariela also arranged for a taxi from Orvitur transfer services to pick us up and take us back to the airport from the Buenos Aires Hilton. She provided email and texting contact information in case of flight delays. This turned out to be very beneficial because our flight was delayed 11 hours due to aircraft mechanicals and later storms in BA on approach. I emailed the taxi service when we arrived at the airport and received an immediate reply with the name of the driver and confirmation that he was waiting for us. Both drivers were friendly and competant taxi drivers. An Orvitur representative emailed me the morning of our departure to confirm time of pickup. Having trustworthy taxi service was very reassuring to us as first-time visitors to Argentina, with limited knowledge of Spanish. Mariela made this happen.Mariela offers tours and other concierge services far beyond our one-day tour for those who need them. But for the limited time we had available for site-seeing during our visit to BA, Mariela made helped make our stay a memorable one."

We ended up having a great time and saw all of the top highlights! Mariela also secured tickets for us to see Argentina play in a world cup qualifying round which was one of the highlights of our trip since we are huge futbol fans. She also recommended a fabulous tango show that we all enjoyed very much. Lastly, she knows a lot of WONDERFUL restaurants and continued to recommend fabulous restaurants throughout our trip!

We could have used another week just on the restaurant list...the best of what you are looking for. She knows what's going on in the city and will make excellent recommendations for events, shops, restaurants. She put us on some free tickets to a performance at the Colon, recommended a semi- finals Polo match and gave us countless restaurant and shopping recommendations.

Although we came somewhat prepared with a loose itinerary for the total of 6.5 days we were spending in BA, it did need some tweaking and Mariela's input was invaluable. She met us on our 2nd day and gave us a tour of the Recoleta Cemetary, the neighborhood, Plaza de Mayo, Subte linea A and ended up at Cafe Tortoni. After the tour, she reviewed our plans and gave her honest assessment about the plans we had which made us shuffle around days for certain neighborhoods and even nix some activities altogether. Her knowledge of the area surpassed any of our expectations and she's very friendly, easygoing and passionate about her city...a pleasure to work with. We did appreciate how she really listened to us and tailored her recommendations to our likes and budget and was prompt with any follow up emails answering questions we had about events, neighborhoods or restaurants. As for restaurants, we got 6 recommendations from her, but only were able to visit 3 (La Olla de Felix, La Cabrera and El Preferido de Palermo) which were spot on. With this being said, I enthusiastically give her my endorsement."

You could spend hours planning a trip remotely, trying to weigh the advice of different guidebooks against each other before throwing your hands up in the air and just \"going with the flow\" or employing a sub-optimal itinerary. Forget it! I had a free weekend in Sao Paulo and on one day's notice, I decided to hop over to Buenos Aires. I had no time to plan anything and would only have a day and a half in B.A. ... so I emailed Mariela. Within hours, my entire trip was planned - sites to see, restaurants to eat at (with reservations made!), activities to do, things to buy. Mariela literally planned everything for me and even found a way for me to enjoy drinks and revelry Argentinian-style the night before the national election, when alcohol sales are prohibited nationally. Mariela provides two different types of services:1. \"Concierge services\" - Basically, Mariella will take care of everything for you so that all you need to worry about is enjoying yourself. And believe me, that won't be hard if you trust Mariela's suggestions. She has lived in B.A. her entire life and knows the city and surrounding areas like the back of her hand. 2. \"Tour guide services\" - Mariela will personally show you around, taking you to all of the best spots in the city while providing historical, social, and political context. She's an authentic porte\u00f1a, speaks perfect English, and is a genuinely cool girl who you will love hanging out with as she wows you with the incredible sights, sounds, and flavors of Buenos Aires. Mariela charges on an hourly basis for either of her services (unlike hotel concierges who have to rely on commissions from the places they recommend), and she is genuinely committed to making your trip spectacular. Her hourly rates are completely reasonable (I could even say cheap, but that's a matter of perspective) and I walked away from Buenos Aires having had an experience that I will never forget. All this from a vacation that I spent zero time planning and decided to take only a day before. Yeah, Mariela is that good! Put down the guidebook and shoot her an email."

My colleague and I traveled to Buenos Aires on business and we had a very compressed time to actually see and experience the city. We met Mariela the day we arrived and she took us to the must see locations in Buenos Aires, including setting up a polo lesson for us. What I loved about seeing the city with Mariela as our guide is that we got to understand not only the culture and customs, but all the nuances that you cannot read out of a Fodors. This enhanced my overall experience so much that I felt like I was able to become part of the culture. I decided to stay an additional day and immediately contacted Mariela to accompany me on my shopping spree. When we met, she had the itinerary in hand, knowing exactly where to take me to accomplish my goal (Christmas shopping) and she was an incredibly valuable resource getting around and translating my very poor Spanish. The biggest gift I received from my two days traveling around Buenos Aires with Mariela? A great new friend..... I highly recommend her."

After Mariela got to know us via some emails and a meeting over a drink, she gave us excellent recommendations in restaurants and activities, based on we liked to do. By day she had us doing some adventurous activities like playing polo, cycling, kayaking and even cooking classes, while at night she booked us into some of the best restaurants in the city. She gave us lots of information with things to do in town, including shopping and the best places to see tango. She listened to what we wanted, and tailored a schedule to suit us. Throughout the whole week she was easily contactable and gave us daily updates about what was happening in town - new restaurants, wine tastings and live music. Buenos Aires is not a city with a huge list of \"tourist attractions\" to traipse around, it is a city to live in ... and for that you need the advice of a local like Mariela. I would recommend her concierge service to anyone wishing to make the most of their time in Buenos Aires."

I am so glad that I acquiesced and listened to her. We contacted Buenos Aires Conceirge and we quickly had a plan through Mariela. Mariela exceeded all of my expectations of what a walking tour entails. She was exceedingly professional, insightful and polished. She started out by asking us what we were looking for in a walking tour and what we enjoyed. She then custom tailored our tour to match our needs and expectations. Not only did we see all of the wonderful sights that one might expect, but I also received, after asking, insight into the economics and politics of the city. My wife and daughter enjoyed Mariela so much that they spent another day with her while I worked. I kept thinking on our tour and when my family went out with Mariela that it was exactly like having a good friend in the city showing us the sites. Mariela was accommodating, engaging and just supremely helpful and enjoyable. I know we all now regard Mariela as a friend of ours and we look forward to seeing her again."

She literally acts as a personal concierge service which makes you feel way more important than you actually are. She always responds promptly(even at 11pm when you are at dinner and looking for a quiet lounge in the area) and is always so detail oriented. My friends literally demanded that we take her to dinner to say thank you because she was so amazing. I have come back to tell everyone about her.  Before the trip even began, we were having issues finding lodging. For some reason, we would go on the various sites and find a place we liked (have the site say available) only to find out later it was already rented. Mariela helped us pester the good people of ApartmensBA.com and find which places were actually available and we ended up saying at a nice 2 bedroom apartment right across from the Botanical garden on Las Heras in Palermo Soho.   Through various emails, Mariela had also basically given us a sample itinerary for our trip based on what I told her were our likes/interests. I'm not even sure \"thorough\" is fair enough an adjective. She gave us choices, options on what nights were the best to go to certain clubs, where to eat and offered help in getting any reservation we wanted. Every bit of advice she gave us was perfect. My favorite meal of the trip happened to be her highest recommended restaurant(Tegui). Even better were her nightclub recommendations. We felt like we were at the best party every single night. Finally, she put us in touch with an agency to get us futbol' tickets to see BOCA play . Just Amazing. Buenos Aires is now my favorite city in the world by far and I have to think Mariela was a big part of that. I love it so much that I am going to go back for a month in November. You can bet my first call will be to Mariela. If you are not from the area, I would say Mariela is someone you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO TALK TO if you want to have a great trip.

            "review": "Work and play. I would fully endorse these tours if u have a morning or afternoon free. Besides being cost effective, the style of the tour guides is more conducive to learning about the city from the perspective of a local. For many frequent travelers this approach is more appealing, as discovering the city in its reality is far more important than the typical tourist trap tours. And inevitably the important landmarks are encountered so its really a win-win situation. A disadvantage, if at all, is that you are subjected to the personality of the tour guides infiltrating the theme of the tour. If you are lucky to have one who is interested in architectural history then you will be in for a treat. If however you end up with one who was hurt by the economic revolution then watch out, it's history class time for the rebellion. One piece of advice, the walks are three hours long so, comfortable foot wear shouldn't be neglected and hot days are a burden even though they are beautiful days. Enjoy!"

I went back for the morning tour which was given by Mariano and was also very good. The cemetery tour was also run by Mariano and was very interesting. The cemetery is amazing place and it was great to hear a bit of history and some very strange stories about its inhabitants! I've done quite a few free walking tours around the world now and theses were among the best. Definitely recommend."

Have in mind they start 10 minutes after the specified hour, so in case you are late you have the time to catch the group. First we did the afternoon City center tour. It took around 3 hours and we made one stop for 15 minutes in a nice cafe. The guide was very good, he told us a lot about the history and the current situation in Argentina. The next day we did the morning walk through Recoleta. It was raining really heavy so the walk was no more than 2 hours, again with short stop in a cafe with delicious empanadas. I recommend both walks but if I have to choose only one, it would be the afternoon one."

I learned so much about Buenos Aires and went back and visited places after to get to the deeper levels he talked about. I went on his morning tour a few days later, which takes in even more of the city and just loved it. As an ex-tour guide, I appreciate how difficult it is to make a tour seem fresh, but Martin keeps it that way. The Free Walks are a great asset for visitors and I told everyone how much I benefited from them, and especially what a great guide I had with Martin!"

But the size was never an issue and Martin has a microphone so his voice projects. I highly recommend doing these tours. You tip at the end based on your experience.

Both Juan Groz and Fernando were great and spoke excellent English. Very knowledgeable and fun to walk with. The others on the tour were from all over the world and fun to meet. They separate the groups into English/Spanish which works well, rather than having to have them repeat the same thing twice.Unless you are in good shape you might want to separate these on different days but we did not have the time.Each of the guides has his own stories and opinions on various things which makes the tour very informative.We also have done \"free\" tours in other cities and it is a great concept. You pay what you think the tour was worth, you can quit anytime if you don't like it. They tell us the average tip is about 150 pesos so it is WAY cheaper than some of the commercial tours and you don't have to drive all around picking people up, you just show up at the starting point and get going.Walking is a much better way to see the city at least for Recoleta and City Center which are fairly compact."

They separate the groups so you're not hearing the tour in stereo. The tours take 3 hours, and they always arrange a stop point about half way through at a cafe for coffee, wifi check and to use the toilet. The city is reasonably flat so there's no issue with keeping up. Some of the stop points are a little noisy (due to road noise) so the guides carry equipment to amplify their voices if necessary. Basically, you get a really good introudction to the history, politics, culture and architecture of Buenos Aires. The guides are really well informed and their stories, which include personal anecdotes, are interesting and entertaining. Basically you pay them at the end based on what you think the tour is worth. If you don't like it, you pay them nothing but I doubt anyone would be of that view. I would highly recommend using these tours. I also did their paid tour of Recoleta cemetery, which was fascinating."

She was local to BA and had loads of interesting and sometimes personal facts about the city, as we as some great insights into Argentinian culture as a whole, which was just what we needed at the start of our 3 week trip. We even kept her back at the end to get a few more tips for our next few days and she didn't seem to mind at all - she was all too happy to stay and help out and gave us an excellent recommendation for the evening.

She was friendly, funny, a walking encyclopedia with her own personal stories sprinkled in, and very easy to understand - I took the Spanish tour. They also offer the tours in English. Although the tours are free you're asked to pay what you'd like if you'd like to. Most of the tour guides are students and I'd imagine this is a big part of their income."

These local guides were full of information and passion about their city, and we learnt so much about the history, politics and economics of Buenos Aries! You don't have to pay, but these tour guides are the best I have had on any walking tour! A special mention must go to Mariano for doing the cemetery tour in the pouring rain, but managing to keep everyone's spirits up, and keeping us laughing!The passion is unreal in these young, fun loving tour guides, and I seriously recommend going on both tours if you are in Buenos Aries !"

Over the course of two days, we took the two free tours and then we took the paid tour of the Recoleta Cemetary. Our guides were Fernando and Mariano. They are both knowledgeable, passionate about their city, funny and personable. For the tour of Recoleta, you can go I your own but without a guide you won't have the full history and flavor of this place and you won't understand the significance of what you are seeing. It was well worth the $150 pesos, which is roughly $10USD. For the free walks, you give the guide a tip, whatever you think is fair. They both speak English and their is always another guide who speaks Spanish. The two tours run simultaneously. Go and have fun!"

Nome.The level of historical introduction plus personal connection with everything that had happened all together were astonishing.

It was a mix of aristocratic buildings inspired by vintage Italian, French, English, and Spanish designs. But also as the city developed newer designs were mixed in. So on 1 corner you can see a new building, a vinage one and 2 mid aged ones. We took the free walking tour on our 2nd day. It was great and taught us a lot about the city. There were 2 guides, 1 who spoke English and the 2nd spanish. After about 3-4 hours of walking we ended at the cemetery. It was on of the most visually amazing cemeteries I've ever seen but the stories of why it is so were a lot less beautiful. The tour is well worth it but bring some money to tip the guide as thats how they get paid."

I love how all the free walks have a pit stop for refreshment and this one needed it as it lasted 4 hours! really really great. It finishes at the Recoleta Cemetery so we stayed on and paid to do that tour, which I would highly recommend as we were told so many interesting stories about the tombs and the families that own them, and more history as some really important figures are laid to rest here! We ended up doing a third tour with Juan the next day, the afternoon city tour which was also really great. He is obviously very enthusiastic about the current political climate here in BA and I found this tour just as informative and you learn a different set of information and see all the major monuments and sights around the Center.

It had everything to go badly, if it weren't for Martin's enthusiasm and knowledge. Several interesting facts and conjectures were presented as we walked from Congresso to the Plaza de Mayo. Martin certainly has his own firm perspective of how things transpired in Argentina recently, and while I retain some healthy skepticism regarding some narratives that sound rather familiar to me (being another fellow Latin American), I definitely respect opposing opinions and welcome new perspectives on history. Much better than a common fact reading tour, that way.All in all, a well deserved 5 stars. You guys rock :)"

Two days later we were lucky enough to find ourselves being walked around with Fernando again on a morning tour. Again it was so interesting we stayed on and took the tour through the Recoleta Cemetery. This tour is not free but well worth the 150 pesos it cost. We could have wandered aimlessly around and I guess we would have eventually found Evitas tomb but Fernando bought the place to life. His passion was contagious and his stories about so many of the tombs were fascinating. Definately not macabre or scarey. A great experience and thanks Fernando for sharing your time and knowledge with us. This tour is a must!!"

It is a good options for people who don't have much time and want at least a general sightseeing of the city, with some interesting and fun stories in the middle. We took the morning tour with Janet, who was nice and warm, and provided us with curiosities and short stories about key spots in Buenos Aires, like the Torre Monumental, Plaza San Martin, Teatro Colon, the Jewish Sinagogue, Retiro and Recoleta barrios and ending in the Recoleta Cemetery at Evita Peron's tomb. I think they could improve if maybe they could leave earlier than 10:30 am, as this leaves more time for people to go get lunch and then take the afternoon tour with them, which visits other parts of the city such as Casa Rosada, The congress, etc. As well, they may think about extending the visit to Recoleta a bit more, as the cemetery is really nice but other than Eva Peron's tomb, there is not much to see if you are not that knowlegeable on argentinian history."

We did the afternoon walk with Martin and the morning walk with Mariano. Both made sure to ask us to give their tour a five star rating on TripAdvisor. If you are going to pick one tour, I recommend the morning one. There seemed to be more things to see. Both of the tours are heavy with talk of Argentine politics and monetary problems.

Such a great way to cover a lot of the city in a short period of time, especially if you are only there for a few days. The tour guides were well versed in the history of the city and monuments as well as the political climate in BA. I was impressed with their knowledge and desire to share as much information as possible. The tours are about three hours, but they go fast and the walking is easy when you are enjoying it as much as I did! There is no cost for the tour, you tip as you see fit at the end. Well worth the money!!"

At the start of the tour, they split you into English v Spanish speaking groups. We had around 15 people in our group. This was a great way to get a overview of this area of the city. Juan Cruz was knowledgeable about the architecture and city. I would have given the tour 5 stars if it had gone into the Recoleta cemetery (Juan stopped outside the cemetery but the Spanish guide took her group into the cemetery we say later). While this is a tip based tour (no fixed cost) the guide recommended 150 pesos per person. I thought this was a reasonable amount for a 3 hour tour. The amount to tip was a pretty light sell and there wasn't a lot of pressure behind the amount to tip."

He was quite engaging and very knowledgeable, and his English was excellent. He did have a large group though, so didn't get much of a chance to move off the standard script. It felt like his USP as a guide was to use local musical forms to enhance the information and experience. This would have been great, but he seemed to want to shoehorn in some cringeworthy lyrics about the tour. I would have preferred it (and I think it would have been better too) if he had just sung the songs with their original content. It was a lovely day for the walk, which took a little over 3 hours and did include a lengthy (and welcome!) stop for lunch and toilet break. We did the walking tour in central Buenos Aires through the other main free company, so I'll comment on that separately. In comparison, this one offers slightly more content, but is less engaging (the cheesy songs didn't help, and we were part of a much smaller group on the other tour). That said, some people really seemed to enjoy the songs (maybe they were tone deaf....) and it only slightly detracted from a very informative and enjoyable walking tour."

You get a decent overview of the city, you walk by it (which is a completely distinct feeling from the one you have from the inside of an AC van that goes around).Anyway, our guide was Mart\u00edn and the tour was spot on. Although apologized a lot when talking about the history of the economy of Argentina, there is no way one could understand this city (and country) without learning about the inflation, hyperinflation, locked exchanged rate, blocked saving accounts etc. (all part of the reason why Argentinians have the \"USD fetish\")With also politicized comments about the city, it was good to have a sociologist delivering the tour.Also giving hints about the city upon request, they deserve a 5 star."

We really enjoyed the morning tour which allowed us to see everything downtown that we had hoped to see & more! The guide was funny & engaging. Unfortunately, the afternoon tour was BORING & long! If you love history & want to know every little detail about B.A.; you may enjoy this. However, half of our large group was disengaged & bored. I was surprised that the guide didn't notice or maybe care that half of his group was yawning & wandering off. He had a major case of verbal diarrhea! We should have left halfway through but stayed to tour the Recoleta cemetary. The worst part was he ended the tour upon entering the cemetary; I was expecting a guided tour of it. He didn't even take us to Evita's grave! Overall, I'd recommend the morning tour but try Buenos Aires Free Walking Tours for the Recoleta tour."

He spoke really well and kept all of us interested. Very personable guy. An easy walk straight down AV de Mayo. Really enjoyed the sites and Andrew's explanations and history. We didn't enjoy the morning tour with Martin as much. It may have been because we had just done the tour with Andrew; perhaps leave a day between if you can. We found there was a lot more walking and less sites in this tour. Martin also spoke very fast English and at times it was quite difficult to understand. If he slowed down it would be much better. In hindsight, we should have told him this from the outset. We didn't enjoy the 20+ minute talk about inflation, especially because Andrew had succinctly covered the topic in less than 5mins the day before. Definitely do one of the walks in Buenos Aires!"

The morning and afternoon tours cover completely different areas of the city, so I would say that it's worth it to do both (although maybe not in the same day as they can be tiring). It gave us a great insight into the history of Argentina and ideas for things to do later in our trip. Thanks, Maru!"

They also tried to stop and talk in the shade when possible as we did the tour on a very hot day. Both tours were about 3 hrs and covered a decent amount of ground so wear comfortable shoes. Franco brought his guitar along on the tour and we really enjoyed his music at our stops! He was a great guide and very friendly. We also enjoyed the rest stop at the little empanada restaurant near Plaza San Martin. Juan Cruz was also a great guide and did a wonderful job of pointing out various architectural details throughout our walk.

The tour was great not staying too long in one place but enough info that if you had time you could go back to the place and find out more. The guide spoke great english and serenaded us with a few songs on the guitar along the way. I wanted to do the 3pm tour too on the same day however I didn't have time to get something to eat for lunch and get across town to the start point by 3pm. The first tour stopped where there was a craft market on saturday so I wanted time to look around the market before I tried to head for the second tour and I just didn't have time and no other days in Buenos Aires."

I had high expectations of doing a walking tour in BA after having done at least 30 walking tours world wide. The guide contextualized everything we were looking at really poorly. In fact half the time myself, my friend and the group just look bewildered and had no idea at the actual Bulding or piece of street art he was talking about most of the time.I did feel sorry for him as it was a big how up of over 30 people and whilst he had a microphone and sound box he was constantly drowned out by the noise of cars etc on the main streets. I lost interest in the first 1.5 hours as it was difficult to understand him and also hear him. Others in the group did too.I would purely recommend people attend this on a Saturday or Sunday as this part of the city is almost a ghost town so it will be easy to see and hear what is going on. My feed back to the company would be to restructure the tour and content to be out of the way of the major traffic. It just doesn't work. Even potentially have a folder of pictures of the buildings and talk about them in quieter side streets and plazas and then walk past them so people can see them in real life. Limit the group sizes to no more than 20 on a week day and / or come up with a good audio solution for people eg blue tooth transmitter so people can use their smart phone to hook into a blue tooth channel and use their headphones to listen ..."

He was also super funny and didn't drag out the history for too long like on many other tours, so you could pay attention and not be bored.

He needs to read up the proper facts about legal discovery, the Pope's decree, French occupation, Argentina's short stay ending in abandonment in 1811 etc. Britain has governed continually since 1833. However, they actually tried to give the islands to Argentina twice in the previous ten years.... and his comment about Maggie Thatcher was totally wrong.... she cannot be equally compared to an Argentinian dictator.

Their very similar names did not help either. (Come on guys, be more creative with your names and make yours stand out!)We ended up with Fernando in the morning, and was so impressed that we returned a few days later for an afternoon tour with Martin. There were a dozen or so in our English speaking tours. To cover the areas and the topics, the walks were brisk, and the delivery was rapid fire. They had good command on English, but sometimes I could not catch everything they said when their accent and speed got in the way.These guys were knowledgeable, passionate, sometimes funny and opionated about Argentina and Buenos Aires. Not only did we learn quite a few things about the Country and the City, we also had a glimpse into the psych of portenos like them.They both seemed to share:- Disdain for the wealthy founding families of BA, in particular their bad taste in art and architecture.- Appreciation for Eva Peron's reaching out to the underprivileged.- Frustration (even dispair) about their government's ineptitude in handling the economy.These guides were not compensated by their company, and only earned from their tips. Treat them well. They are far better deals than those tours that charge $$$USD."

I did it the day after I arrived and it not only gave me my bearings, it also was a great local introduction to the culture, history and even dialect of Buenos Aires. You can do this walk in English or Spanish. I chose Spanish because the group was smaller and actually learned a lot just about some differences in Argentinian Spanish vs Spanish Spanish or Mexican Spanish. The tours go on for like 3 hours and they are free though you tip at the end. And you really should tip because your guide is working his/her tail off to tell you all about their city. I also recommend this because I found out about so many places to go during the tour that I saved for later. This was one of my favorite activities I did while I was in BA. I highly recommend. So educational, cultural and fun! Also good exercise and a great way to get to know the city. Enjoy!"

We typically like to explore on our own, but we thought getting some local insight on our first day might be a good way to get a better feel for the city. We turned up for the afternoon tour and had such a good experience we did the Recoleta tour this morning.The guides for both were exceptional. Mariano and his team clearly share a passion for their city. As they share stories at each stop along the way, they give you a great feel for the pulse of the city and the popular opinions of its people.We learned a lot, and really appreciated the dry sense of humour our guides provided.

However, our guide Martin delivered a performance way better than any other walking tour I've ever been to on both the morning and the afternoon tour. The morning (Recoleta) tour is a bit more about sightseeing, but gives a great insight to Argentina's current situation and near history. The evening tour is more about politics and social issues, which I thought to be even more interesting. I highly recommend both of these tours, just don't do them on the same day as there's A LOT you'll learn."

The tour started at Teatro Col\u00f3n and ended at Cementerio de la Recoleta (10:30am - 2pm). At the end of the tour I had time to look around Recoleta Cemetery for a while and then walk over to the start of the afternoon tour (National Congress). My guide for that tour was Loli. The tour started at 3pm and ended at Plaza de Mayo. Both of the guides were very good and did a great job teaching us about Buenos Aires and Argentinian history. They both spoke excellent English, were very clear, and did a good job taking groups through a busy city.There was almost no overlap between the morning and afternoon tours so I am glad I did them both. The morning one was in the less busy Recoleta neighborhood whereas the afternoon one was in the busy and packed city center. If you are planning to do both in one day, don't plan on a long lunch since it is about 2.5-3 kilometers between the ending point of the first tour and the starting point of the second. Overall, I highly recommend it if you want to have a nice, entertaining walk through the city.If anyone is interested, these videos show the highlights of the two tours: morning Recoleta tour (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_H2bsmKOs0), afternoon City Center tour (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCb23xD7Mnc)."

Very sweet guy, but the tour seemed pretty long. I sort of wish I had bailed and did my own thing."

Well tell that little voice in your head to stop talking and walk to the starting point of either the AM or PM tour because these guides know what they're talking about and they take you to the most historic parts of the city. After our first tour with Martin we were completely sold (rather, convinced because this tour is free, remember?!) He spoke perfect English, was funny, and was also very passionate about the city. It was awesome, so awesome that we went the next day for AM trip. Fernando was our guide and he too was very knowledgable of the city, humorous, and spoke perfect English. They welcomed any questions and also gave us great information on Tango shows, restaurants, and exchanging money. Wear your walking shoes and bring cash to tip these fantastic guides."

Both were very well done.Our first one was the afternoon tour, starting at the Congress building. The group was divided into two groups, those who preferred English and those who preferred Spanish. Our Engish group walked with Andrew, a charming young American who had come to learn Spanish three years ago, and fell in love with a young Argentinian lady and stayed. He was informative, friendly, spoke loudly so everyone could hear him and kept the interest of the group. We walked from the Congress to the Casa Rosada and it took about 2 1/2 hours. There was a 15 minute break about half way through and we stopped at a gelato shop where you could buy ice cream if you wished and to use the bathrooms. Wearing comfortable walking shoes is a must as there are quite a few cobblestone streets along the way.Our second tour was the morning tour of Recoleta. This one starts at the Theatre Colon and goes to Recoleta cemetary. It was a long day beginning at 10:30 am and we finished at 2:30 pm. It turned out to be a very hot day, so it was a good idea to carry water with you as you walked. Mariano was our guide (once again the tour was divided between the Spanish and English speakers) and he is a native Porteno. Enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and kept the group moving. We stopped for our break at a place where you could buy Empanadas, which was a good idea as the tour partially took place during the lunch period. Both tours were very good, interesting, and come recommended. We learned something from each one and enjoyed them both. Comfortable shoes, bringing water and money for snacks and your tip will make your day a pleasant one."

AND it was AMAZING! perfect mix between history, social cues and trivia, and just funny anecdotes about one thing or another. Overall great experience, highly recommend it! Please don't forget to tip your guide at the end!"

My husband and I had just two days in Buenos Aires before a longer trip to Antarctica so we looked into the free walking tours to try to see the city highlights in a short time. We had an easy walk to the meeting point at Libertad and Viamonte, near the Teatro Colon, for the morning tour. What I liked about this free tour is you don't have to sign up ahead of time--just appear if it fits into your schedule. There were quite a few people so they used two guides, each group having about 20 people.Fernando was very enthusiastic and full of information. He spoke loudly and clearly and you could hear him without difficulty. The tour covered a lot of ground, which we appreciated, as our time in BA was limited. We really loved the Plaza de San Martin, which we found more picturesque than Plaza de Mayo. And lo and behold--what an amazing sight! We stumbled upon an induction ceremony for new ambassadors to Argentina! Band, honor guard, red carpet--the works! So exciting!The other highlight of the tour was at the end: Recoleta Cemetery. Located in an affluent neighborhood, this cemetery is filled with the mausoleums of Buenos Aires' wealthy and famous. Each person tried to make their final resting place even more extravagant than the previous. The result is an over-the-top display where row after row of mausoleums create a type of cemetery city. Really quite a sight. Evita Peron is buried there. The tour did not go inside the Iglesia de Pilar (next to the cemetery) but it is worth a quick visit.I highly recommend this tour. We would have done the afternoon one as well if we'd had time. Enjoy!"

The group was quite big and this made me doubt it could turn out to be an enjoyable experience. Luckily there were no reasons to doubt. Martin, who led the tour, made an amazing job in keeping the group together and setting the right tempo. He stopped in places that would not be of hindrance for other people and spoke in a clear and loud enough voice so that everybody could hear him. Above this, the information he gave was interesting and engaging. I joined a couple of these concept tours in the past and usually the information I received remained anecdotal and more superficial, aimed at entertaining more actually informing. This was not the case with Martin: he delved into several historical events and their ongoing developments , the economic crisis and its social effects, architecture, the birth of tango and much, much more and not once I felt bored or disengaged, but, quite the contrary, I felt increasingly captivated by what he had to say.I recommend it without hesitation."

Her English was excellent and she paced it well, stopping partway through at a little sandwich shop where we bought sandwiches, pastries, and drinks, and used the restrooms.

We were already tired when taking the afternoon tour but Maru managed to make us forget about that and she kept our attention for 4 hours! !! She is very knowledgeable ( a history student ) and she provided us tons of information but in a very interesting way with lots of energy and passion for what she does. Also she carries a book with lots of pictures of how some buildings used to look like and of popular events and demonstrations that took place at squares we visited. That is how dedicated to her tours she is. I loved her enthusiasm and also her neutral position on burning matters as she would provide us all the information and let us make our opinions on the subject. I have to add that Laura's morning Recoleta tour was highly amusing as well. She is really funny and i believe she could make any topic sound interesting. Both girls are very warm, generous and helpful, willing to adjust their rhythm to our needs, answer all the questions we had and their effort for providing us a very informative yet interesting and amusing tour is very noticeable. Their contribution to our BA visit was immense. Take these tours, wear comfortable shoes, bring watter with you and there is no way to regret it..."

Since it was a big group he spoke loud and was therefore very good to understand. Also he managed to keep the group somehow together while crossing all the streets and the busy traffic. The information he gave was very interesting and not online historic facts but also tips and reflections of the daily life of the Porte\u00f1os.All in all an excellent tour!"

Thanks Martin for giving us so much and so good information and made my trip more colourful in Buenos Aires to understand the background behind and the history of this Amazing city. Although it was raining, people were celebrating the 13 of December he kept going with such an enthusiasm, i got so surprized and overwealmed with all the information we attained. Thanks again Martin, you were unbeliverble. He kept going for 3 hours and really gave us so good advises to cope in Buenos Aires by our own too."

The guide spoke fantastic English and kept us entertained throughout the 3 hour walk. It was a very hot day and he was great at finding shady spots to stop. Although the group was huge I thought he did an amazing job at keeping everyone informed and engaged. The route explored some of the northern parts of te city before ending in the big cemetery. I ended up meeting some great people to explore the rest of the city with. A fun way to get to know the city, plus it's free! Was very happy to tip as Fernando was a great guide."

In any case an exceptional introduction to a small section of central Buenos Aires (basically hitting 3 parks going generally North from the meeting point, with focal point the gomero, a piece of lazy fauna imported from Australia), giving plenty of background. A 3-hour tour turned into 3.5 but no one seemed bothered. His English was very understandable and loud for the large crowd to hear. One of the better free walking tours I have done. I won't miss the afternoon tour tomorrow...."

Recommend doing this tour on the first or second day of the trip to get acquainted with Buenos Aires history. It's a lot of walking so pick a day with cool weather and definitely bring water. Our guide, Martin, was really first rate. Don't expect some cheesy, touristy overview of the city - Martin is a sociologist and ex-professor who is passionate to share his knowledge of buenos aires' past and present with his group. You feel like you are attending an intellectual study abroad program at university! So thankful we looked into this walking tour and unbelievable that this is a free activity. Tip generously, they are worth it!"

The impression to me is that the morning one is more about architecture and history while the afternoon one is more about political side. We joined both tours the second day we got to BA. Both tour guides were very passionate about their job and gave a wonderful and lively introduction of the city. As a visitor, it's also an opportunity to get in touch with local people. We spotted some interesting attractions during the tour and went back later on our own. Overall, it's a great way to start the trip in Buenos Aires."

You won't spend much time at each sight, however you can always come back to the places you are interested in, thus in my opinion it's really helpful to do this tour on the first day of your stay in Buenos Aires.They are also quite funny and happy to answer our questions. Both tours last about 3 hours and can be a bit tiring especially with the very hot weather in summer, so make sure to bring water and put on sunscreen."

Some things that annoyed me a buit: BA is loud, so in order for the whole (big!) group to understand you, the guide sometimes had to yell. It would be better to go to a more quiet place before a long explaination. The afternoon tour could also use a break somewhere in between. And lastly, there are a couple of ways to tell history, one of them is rambling of all the facts and the other is telling the story. While both tours certainly did their best to tell the story, they went back to rambling of facts alot. But again, the tours are certainly recommended."

I stumbled upon this company during my second visit to BA, after a slightly dissatisfying experience with the paid for city tours, especially the open-top bus when I was last here (lengthy queues, superficial commentary) which meant I still didn't feel I had any handle on the city. The walking tours are very much the opposite experience. Although they are notionally a tour of a particular part of the city, the locations you visit are really prompts for the guides to talk about the history of the city and its people. There are two tours and while they visit different areas, the guides seem to have agreed to cover different subject matters on each tour.The morning tour starts from the Theatre Colon and makes its way via the war memorial and the English Tower to Recolleta Cemetery. The commentary is more about the culture and the people. The afternoon tour starts from the National Assembly and ends at the Pink Palace. As you might expect the commentary here is more about the history, politics and socio-economics.The tours are advertised as two and half to three hours, but our morning tour ended up taking over four hours as we picked our way around strikes, demonstrations and protests by the indigenous peoples at the war memorial. You certainly get a feel for Argentina\u2019s turbulent politics and economics.Just a couple of pointers; tip generously at the end, bring comfortable footwear and something to drink. Also I think these tours are not really for families with young kids, they probably will get bored. And most importantly don't wear a union jack t-shirt when you\u2019re visiting the war memorial (as one of our group did!)"

The tour was quite good and covered a lot of ground with well-spaced stops and great explanations from our guide, Loli.The best part was the excellent historical-political commentary from Loli. I am Argentine (was doing the touristy thing for the benefit of my non-Argentine wife) and found her explanations of the political system, the class divisions, and especially the Malvinas-Falklands conflict to be excellent, neutral, and nuanced. On these touchy topics it is hard to be both an engaging tour guide as well as an accurate historian. Loli was excellent. You will learn a lot about Argentina, not just about the beautiful buildings and parks.I asked privately and was told that the average tip is 55 AR$. I thought the tour was worth a bit more (and tipped commensurately, in dollars)."

If you travel alone is a great opportunity to make friends just like I did. I took one morning tour and another day one noon tour. They gave me the best impression of Buenos Aires. I highly recommend this tour for people all ages. All countries. No matter what your native language even if its spanish. By the way, I follow them on my facebook and it seems that they will have Spanish tours coming soon. How cool! I was there during the polar wave in July. So make sure for winter to take something really warm with you otherwise you wont enjoy the tour that much. You need to tip them whatever you feel like."

Firstly, Fernando is a great guide: friendly, funny and informative. He makes a real effort to get to know everyone on the tour and remember where you are all from. His English is exceptionally good too. And I have to mention here, in reference to a previous reviewer, he DID NOT at any point mention tipping or money at all. And if you don't like what you're getting, you are free to leave the tour at any point!The tours last around 3-4 hours, but you do not feel exhausted by this at all. On the way, you get to see the different architectures, visit different neighbourhoods and learn political and cultural history. We got to go in some of the buildings that I imagine would be difficult to do without the tour guide. For example, we got to go in Cafe Tortini, the oldest coffee house in the city that has maintained its original features. The queue for this coffee house was down the block, but Fernando arranged for us to go in small groups to take pictures. On the afternoon tour there were 20 people and on my morning tour there were 12 people. Although the afternoon tour didn't feel crowded, I preferred the morning tour as we seemed to jell better and get on more. What I really loved was meeting and chatting to different people from all over the world and I loved the fact that there were people from Buenos Aires who wanted to improve their English, meet new people and experience their own city.Fernando was a great guide and clearly passionate about what he did. When the tour ended he offered up loads of tips and recommendations and was happy to answer any questions (throughout the tour too!) I thought the tours were fantastic and donated 200 pesos."

With that being said, everyone should definitely tip because the guides are so knowledgeable and they allow you to see Buenos Aires from their perspective. I've already recommended the tour to my friends and family and will continue to do so! Thanks for making my stay in BA much more enjoyable!"

Very friendly as well and wanted us to get to know each other too so we were not just a bunch of mutes \"stalking him\" as we roamed the streets of Buenos Aires. He takes you to all the major sites but then also takes you to things you would not be able to see from the main roads. Fernando (as I am sure all the guides too) knows a lot of information about the history so feel free to ask the guides questions. The tour ended in Recoleta Cemetery and i thought we would part ways there, but they actually take you inside and show you some of the mausoleums and tombs, including the one of Evita. At the end Fernando also gave us some recommendations of places to eat and how to get there. I have done walking tours before in South America and this was one of the better ones I have done!"

His passion for his city was infectious and he gave the best overview of the city's past we encountered among many such tours. He also spent a very long time after the tour answering questions and drawing maps for everybody, way beyond the call of duty. A word of advice for any readers, do this tour immediately upon arriving in BA. They will give you so much advice on what to do during your stay that it would be foolish to leave it until the end when your time may be limited. No matter how much research you do yourself it will not come close to what you will learn from Guillermo and his colleagues."

It is perfect for every type of traveller from the budgeting backpacker to the business man as you can pay nothing or tip as much as you want depending on how much you think it was worth.

I have been to more than 6 of these types of tours in Europe and elsewhere and this one certainly lived up to my expectations. We first did the afternoon tour with Guillermo and liked it so much we did the morning tour with Dolores the next day. Each tour covered completely different parts of BA and both guides were friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful.-Rod from NYC"

Mariano gave a wonderful history of the architecture and social mores of the lovely early 20th century inhabitants of Recoleta, the Micro Center and the Theater District. The concept of free tours for tips worked perfectly in our group of people of all ages and nationalities. Not only did we enjoy Mariano's commentary (no problem projecting with our group of 18) but we really appreciated his little tips (try an Alfajor, for example,) and his suggestion of the perfect place for empanadas for lunch. If you can walk briskly for 3 hours, this is the tour for you."

In both cases the staff was very honest and knowledgable making a good balance of historical facts, opinions about argentine economy and politics, funny stories and architecture. Also the guide gave us his personal view of a character like Eva Peron- wich is quite complex- in a very clear and sincere way. The historical perspective of the city helps a lot to understand almost anything you will find in the city and the guides are open to receive any questions off topic and personal feedback. After doing several free tours in Europe we think that BA free walks matchs the standar of a high quality tour of this type. Great Job!!"

We did have a little difficulty finding the group due to inaccuracies in Travel Advisor's BUE city guide app map. We were very glad we noticed the group forming on a corner about 4-5 blocks from where the Trip Advisor map said the Theatro Colon should be.Guillermo was very knowledgeable and engaging sharing information about the history and politics of the city. It was a great way to get an overview and background of the areas we visited. Now we have the opportunity to decide if we want to tour any of the sites in more detail. Guillermo made himself very available to answer questions about Buenos Aires and Argentina. He even would mark participant's maps for recommendations or if they were interested in visiting a particular site. The only fee is the tip amount you decide. We paid what we would expect to pay for a paid walking tour. It was worth every penny... errr peso.We stumbled upon Buenos Aires Free Walks completely by accident and are very happy we did. Highly Recommended!"

He gave us a very good perspective of argentine history and many things that helped us having a good introduction to what to see in BA. His explanations we really clear with a mixture of facts and jokes making the experience relaxed and informal in comparison to a traditional tour. The next day we took the afternoon tour with Mariano (also a porteno as Guillermo). He demostrated that the BA free walks has an excellent staff and all their guides know how to guide really well making the walk enjoyable but without skipping any important historical or political facts!! He was very enthusiastic with a different style and he was very knowledgable about architectural styles showing us the highlights of the city center.Both tours took around 3 hours, we recommend taking both of them in different days.

Vaticano by Teatro Colon, the morning tour, was in hot sun and had about 11 participants.The tour was OK for sure, only negative was far too long a stop in some cafe. A quick first stop just to buy some water or cold drink at a kiosk was OK, but we didn\u00b4t want to sit almost a half hour in the cafe.Also the tour starting by Teatro Colon should start under big tree across in park to provide shade or shelter from rain.Thanks anyway for 2 really good tours at whatever price the participant wants to pay."

First of all he introduced himself and explained us the path of our tour, how long it was going to take (between 3 and 3.5 hours) and what a free walking tour is. He also made a special emphasis on the fact that we could ask him whatever we wanted even if it was something off-topic. We started in front of the Teatro Colon with a small introduction to know why Buenos Aires is called the Paris of South America, wich was very useful for us to understand every later in the tour and the consecutive days we explored the city by ourselves. In Plaza San Martin he told us about the rich families of the old aristocracy of BA mixing information with some jockes and urban leyends on the way. We also had a very good local perspective of the Falklands war. We finished the tour at 2 p.m. (after a little bit more than 3 hours). The distance is fine for any average walker and you won't get tired as there is a stop in a cafe to rest for a while and go to the bathroom in the way. After we finished, Mariano gave us the best recommendations of what to see in Recoleta and we liked so much that he said he would remain in the place (even after the tour was finished) as long as we need to answer all our cuestions and for anything that we needed. Great Job! Highly recommended!"

BA Free Walks guides threw out a lot of names and dates but there was a lot more walking than talking, and unlike previous tours where you can tell the guides do a lot of extra reading to teach us random facts about the city - or relevant cultural references - the BA Free Walks guides tend to stick close to script.

His passion for and knowledge of the city was clearly apparent and well expressed in an interesting and sometimes humourous way. He took us to sights and told us anecdotes we wouldn't have experienced otherwise. The pace, number of stops, and routes have been well thought out and appropriate for an average walker - and leaves plenty of time for other activities the same day. It really helped us navigate our way through the city when we were on our own afterwards. We are very happy that we took a tour on foot rather than in a bus. You see so much more and there are many more opportunities to take photos, meet local people, get a good look at architecture and monuments, and experience street life in BA. In an effort to find some constructive suggestion, all I can offer is that the noise of BA's streets occasionally makes it difficult to hear the guide - but that is very minor compared to all the positive aspects of a tour with BA Free Walks - and is easily remedied by standing closer. I hope they expand their tours to other parts of the city by my next visit. I recommend doing both tours - but not in the same day. Please do tip the hardworking guides. Overall, VERY well worth it."

Our tour guide Gville made the tour interesting and fun. The tour takes approximately three hours to complete. You get a chance to visit a few of the neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. I personally would recommend this tour for anyone visiting Buenos Aires and if you can take the tour with Gville. He works on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You will not be disappointed."

Mariano provided a nice mix of historical information and fun facts. It was very hot, however, he did a good job of stopping at mostly shady spots. He is very knowledgeable of architecture and BsAs history, and shares good information about today's BsAs.This tour packed a lot of information (and a lot of ground - wear comfortable shoes!) into 3 hours and it was a great introduction to Buenos Aires. Highly recommend!"

It's such a large city, it seems easy for the history and details to get lost in the shuffle. Our guide, Mariano, was knowledgeable and funny and spoke great English. For three hours he took us from the National Congress to the Obelisk, trying to keep us in the shade as it was sweltering, and answering all questions. We tipped him at the end for a job well done.P.S. Also a great way to meet fellow travelers. In addition to the two of us from Seattle, our group consisted of a Swede with her Argentine friend, an Australian, and two South Koreans."

Our guide did not seem very knowledgable about the tour. We left the tour after one hour as we were so bored. I think our guide spoke for about 5-10 minutes during the hour we were on the tour. Other than telling us the name of the buildings she did not provide much more information. I have been on many free walking tours of cities and I have found them to normally be if a high standard but this was terrible. The next day we went on a walking tour recommend by our accommodation (Buenos Aires Free Tour) it was excellent. It is a free tour so you can vote with you tip, or lack of. I felt the need to review this as the fantastic tour that I went on the next is rated lower than this tour and we did lose an afternoon that we could have used to see more of the city. Free Walks - ensure your guides are all trained to the standard mentioned in previous reviews."

Already having been here for a month, I was hesitant to participate; however, last Sunday, I decided to give it a try. I I thought knew a good deal about the areas I passed on my bus and walking routes each day, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I still had more to learn. Not only did Buenos Aires Free Walks tell me new information about places I visited each day, but my tour guide did so in a kind and relatable way. She even shared her mate with the whole tour group! Furthermore, he tour guide was personable yet professional as she shared the history and tales of Buenos Aires.

Our team leader was called Barbara (even though he allowed us to call him Barby ) and he was so so funny! I highly recomend doing it because you will never regret it! We are definetly going to come back!"

I'm really interested in knowing details about the places I visit, small stories and facts that only people that live there can provide, and this tour was one of them, but never being dull in the process. The guides were entertaining and carismatic but without leaving out important info facts about the places we visited. like for example the great stories and myths in Plaza San Martin about the aristocratic families that lived there at the begginig of the XXth century and all the info about the beautiful architecture that reminds every visitor that BA is the Paris of South America Don't miss the tour when coming to the city as I can't recommend it enough."

I am already in love with BA, Buenos Aires Free Walk and my guide Mariano just made my love stronger. I suggest Buenos Aires Free Walk to everyone visiting BA !!!! Awesome & memorable tour I had !!!"

            "review": "\u00a1Absolutamente un \u00e9xito!. On a cold day in July, when the sky looks the same at 9a as it does at 4p, I had no idea what to expect. All I knew is that I wanted a tour--especially since it was my first time in Buenos Aires, and it wasn't looking like the plans with friends were working out. I had tried several options listed in my guidebook, but I hit a wall every time. So it must have been serendipity that I stumbled upon Buenos Aires Free Walks in the plaza outside Teatro Col\u00f3n on a cold Sunday morning. I didn't even know for sure what was going on, but I suspected something when this guy was standing there looking around, trying to show his bright orange T-shirt in the cold. I took my chances and came up to him: \"You don't happen to be a tour guide, do you?\"What a great decision! Mariano with Buenos Aires Free Walks was perfectly happy to show me around, even though it looked like I'd be the only one on his tour. We covered many of the major landmarks around Plaza San Martin and Retiro, ending outside the Recoleta Cemetery. But Mariano did much more than just point out the important landmarks--he clearly had done his research, pointing out prominent examples of architecture from a number of different periods, then interweaving it with funny anecdotes. More than happy to answer questions and equally comfortable bringing his personal experience as a lifelong porte\u00f1o, Mariano is clearly a committed guide. Whether you visit this great Argentine capital alone or with a group, I encourage you to swing by Teatro Col\u00f3n on your first day and join in on one of the Free Walks! You of course decide how much you're willing to pay, but I suspect you'll feel impelled to loosen that wallet quite a bit. A great way to learn about the city!"

They tell little anecdotes that make the tour more personal- my favorites were the stories about the fights that occurred between the old aristocratic families. Very fascinating! They also go into great detail about the architecture (mainly in the Recoleta area). My family and I are big architecture buffs so we really appreciated this. The tour is top notch and the tour guides are just as great. I definitely recommend Buenos Aires Free Walks!"

As an appreciator of street art and graffiti for years, I was eager to see what artists and writers were doing down in BA vs. my home here NYC. And our guide Luisa, delivered. She was not only lovely but passionate about both the art and the neighborhoods we visited - ones that I normally wouldn't have seen or known about. The insight she provided into the different pieces we saw really brought them to life. It's fun to draw your own conclusions, but she brought the pieces to life by providing richer background into the artist's interests and their thinking behind the murals and pieces we saw. It was a great way to spend an afternoon in BA - as well as a great way to support a stellar community effort by this organization to encourage collaboration amongst artist and neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. Highly recommended if you're into exploring new neighborhoods and immersing yourself in the communities you're visiting."

I booked the industrial side of the city tour. 24 hours before the tour day, I got an email saying that only 2 people have signed up and that it will likely be cancelled due to the costs of the mini-bus. They could not arrange a tour for just the 2 people due to higher taxi transportation costs running into almost US $100 compared to US$30 per person in a mini-bus. However, they offered a tour in another section of the city. It was a great tour and the stories and context explained by Mariana was awesome. You can really feel the passion from the BA street art folks. Kudos for making this happen. I highly recommend this tour and hope you get a chance to visit the industrial side of the city for their massive murals."

Luckily for us, Anderson actually lives in Urquiza, so we really got a local\u2019s perspective on the area. He showed us some breathtaking murals and stencils\u2014some stretching entire buildings, others hidden on side streets or on storefront grates. He seemed to know everything about the history and artist behind each piece. Now whenever I\u2019m walking in the city or am sitting on the bus, I can\u2019t help but look up at the tops of buildings, in search of hidden gems and sometimes I can recognize the work of one of the artists that Anderson showed us.

Matt was great and very passionate about the street art and it's great to know that his company has a vested interest in the artists and the art around the city. Such a diversity in styles and techniques and interesting stories of the artists and their art. The area we walked around was also intriguing as it was so different from the central city of BA. Tree lined streets with almost English looking houses as opposed to the high rise apartments found more centrally.Finished up at their small gallery underneath the cool NYC Bar in Palermo and after such an interesting tour bought a small picture by the artist Luxor.

Sofia our guide spoke fantastically, she was very knowledgable and open to all questions. The art around the city is amazing and we will probably look into doing another one in a different area or even the stencil workshops BA street art offer. Highly reccomend it!"

Very interesting way of learning about street art in general, its development in Buenos Aires and South America, the political and legal context (the influence of dictatorships, resistance in art, the Afro-black history in the country etc), as well as the forms & techniques used. The tour covered 2 neighbourhoods, Villa Urquiza and Coghlan, that are not usually visited by tourists. A visit to the organization's gallery to end the tour provided an opportunity to speak with one of the street artists himself, as well as the founder of BA Street Art tour. That was also an informative part of the tour. Enjoyed it and I recommend it if you are curious to know more about street art!"

The street art tour or graffiti tour with BA Street Art tours was absolutely fantastic!Friends had recommended that I do one of the walking tours as they had thoroughly enjoyed it. They also run private mini bus tours but on this occasion I was on my own and so the walking tour suited me just fine. The tour was extremely well-organised and the tour guide Matt, had a fantastic first-hand knowledge of the street art scene. In fact, I really felt that we were being given more of an exclusive \"behind the scenes\" look at things as Matt mentioned his BA Street Art had actually commissioned/organised some of the murals and of course knew the artists personally! We got great insight into the story behind the murals and the way the artists actually approached the work.I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is visiting Buenos Aires! It's a fun way to explore the city that everyone can enjoy!"

I settled for the BA Street Art tour instead.The two 20 something guides were US expats, so no language problem. The walking tour was in Villa Urquiza and Coghlan, two neighborhoods I would not have visited otherwise.The tour started with two huge murals covering several stories of two buildings. One was hardly legible from fading. The rest of the murals on the tour were nearly all on 8 - 10 feet walls. Very disappointing. After the tour, a long walk to view some graffiti art hanging on the walls inside a bar was a waste of time.I look forward to a graffitimundo tour the next time I visit BsAs. With their minibus as transport, I expect to see those huge murals scattered in more neighborhoods."

To find out more about them, I spent two days with BA Street Art Tours visiting walls in the north and south of the city. Both Matt and Sophia have an infectious passion for the art and a talent for telling the stories behind the work. The first day we did a walking tour around Villa Urquiza. BA Street Art have worked with artists like Martin Ron to create a amazingly colorful spaces that lighten up the barrio. The second day, we went to the South of the city to the more gritty areas of Barracas and La Boca. We took a mini bus around the barrios and stopped at the more iconic street art images, like Martin Ron's turtle. We were also fortunate to see one of the painters in action on a wall in an industrial estate. Thanks BA Street Art for opening my eyes to something new in a city I thought I had done everything in. I can't recommend the tours highly enough."

We spent a little over two weeks on vacation in Argentina over the Christmas and New Years holidays, split between Buenos Aires and the northwestern Salta region. Hands down, this tour was the best three hours we spent anywhere on this trip. What made it so great? First, the art is AMAZING. But the real answer lies in the quality of the tour guide, Sofia. She was able to bring a passion and knowledge not only of street art but of the history of Argentina and Buenos Aires within which this art exists. There was the context of street art within the social and economic climate in Buenos Aires pre- and post dictatorship (which ended in 1983). And there was detailed explanation of each of the artists, their individual philosophies and references to other art they may have created elsewhere in the city or, in many cases, throughout the world. Yes, these artists are known worldwide, perhaps not to the same level of acclaim of artists whose works land in museums, but they are rightfully recognized and celebrated nonetheless. This art medium is accessible to anyone, but you have to know where to find it. Buenos Aires Street Art not only took us there but made it, and Argentina, come to life in a way that made it the highlight of our vacation."

The company responded to my inquiries Monday night and then to some questions I had first thing on Tuesday... Second, the guide, Matt, was fantastic. He is extremely knowledgeable (he co-wrote a book on BA street art, knows many of the artists and actually had a hand in getting some works done by either finding the space for an artist or an artist for a space). Matt also was extremely accommodating in showing us art and locations that he specifically thought we'd be interested in... and he was right BA has AMAZING street art and, if you are visiting, you shouldn't miss the opportunity to see some with BA Street Art Tours where they can explain, in many cases, the background of the piece, the materials used by the artist and the artists themselves."

I've been on quite a few tours in my day from South Bend to Siem Reap, and I've noticed that there some qualities that really make certain experiences special - This one has all those qualities! Let me summarize 3:1. Passion: I hate it when I can tell our guide is doing it for the money, or because they were working those particular hours, etc. Our guide for this tour, Matt, is not like that at all. He has been embedded in the BA street art scene for quite a while and it shows. When he describes the pieces, you can tell they mean much more than the next stop for him.2. Knowledge: Yes, all tours should be informative but Matt showed off his background as an ex-journalist here. What a piece means, historical context, medium, technique, odd stories are all explored within this 2.5 hour excursion.3. Uniqueness: It was one of those things that I truly felt that I couldn't have gotten anywhere else in the world, from anyone else. As you will hopefully be seeing, Buenos Aires is a perfect storm of street art - this tour gives an organic view of the lesser explored parts of the city, and is great for street art enthusiasts and simply those who are curious about it."

The tour provided a lens for understanding the history of Argentina, current socio-political issues, as well as the contemporary street art movement. Sofia was an extremely knowledgeable and fun guide. She brought interesting facts about the neighborhood into historical context, including a car with historical significance (used by the military dictatorship to \u201cdisappear\u201d people).

This is definitely worth an afternoon of your time. Matt was also very helpful in emailing me the addresses of other large murals in the city and other areas that are good for street art. There are some new pieces we would not have found otherwise. Sofia was lovely, but I secretly wished that the tour could have been conducted by an Argentinian rather than an American! We were probably slightly spoiled by our street art tour in Valparaiso which was done by a young Chilean guy who was himself a street artist. That gave a very different perspective. I think a slight improvement could be if Sofia was more aware that we wanted to take photos of the whole wall. She tended to get to the wall, stand in front of it with the whole group, and then move on to the next one leaving some of us trying to get photos of the wall without people in it. By the time we had caught up again we had missed what she was saying about the next one. If she was a bit more aware of the photography that would be good."

In Bogota I went on the street art tour there due to the multitude of graffiti, and so when I came to Buenos Aires, I got so excited to see that they had a similar graffiti tour. So I went. The tour was excellent. Well priced, the guide was well informed, and the art was beautiful. This is definitely a MUST do for any tourist visiting Buenos Aires. It is not the usual tourist activity and you learn so much about history, politics, art, and current events in Buenos Aires and Argentina. Plus at the end they take you to a bar where you can purchase some really cool works by well known street artists from all over the world. Also there's a pit stop for ice cream...delicious. Definitely a great tour! Thank you BA street art for the fantastic afternoon!!"

This tour was a great introduction to the rich city of Buenos Aires, and a refreshing addition to the city's more traditional touristic attractions. The tour guide, Sofia, uses the prolific street art of Buenos Aires as a platform to discuss Argentine culture and history. The whole city is a free outdoor museum, and this tour is as much a lesson as it is an exploration of the significance of various murals and tags. Sofia is generous with her knowledge and time, and I came away with a much more layered and nuanced understanding of both the street art movement and the city of Buenos Aires."

Loved it that the organization actually knows and works with many of the artists so they could tell us the meaning and the stories behind many of the murals firsthand. Really inspired us and we hope to take one of their aerosol classes during our visit! After all, how many times does an American get the chance to paint on the side of a building legally??? Highly recommended.Details: it was $20/person and ran about 3hrs. It is an outdoor walking tour, so definitely wear comfortable shoes and have sun protection if you need it.

Well, in summary:- the artworks selected were nice and in a part of town you wouldn't discover otherwise. - most of the times, though, the tour lacked depth and social perspective. - we were herded from wall to wall, only to hear that the guide \"was not sure exactly what the piece meant, but he thought it related to\"... (insert brief explanation).- the explanations were most of the times \"as you see, this is pretty cool\", \"kind-of-indigenous inspired thing\", or just the technique used by the artist (brush / stencil / aerosol). It gets pretty boring to see about 20 different artworks and only hear that they were made by combining aerosol spray and stencils. - at times guide didn't know what he was talking about: in front of a mural of Karl Marx he said it was Stalin; mosaics were \"invented in Paris in the '70s\" (I suggest the guide to go to Italy and see some mosaics from the Roman Empire period), etc. I wouldn't take the tour again."

Interesting and informative with Sofia and a group of North Americans intent on taking pictures - wonder what they do with them!The highlight was understanding the paintings and the stories behind and realising that Buenos Aires has embraced a form of contemperory culture that some European cities still criminalise and treat as non art.

The street art was astounding, and it was interesting to learn about this unconventional art form and the sociopolitical context it holds in BA. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking to immerse themselves in the contemporary urban culture that this city has to offer."

If you, like me, love graffiti and street art, this is the tour for you.You get to walk around in areas you probably wouldn't have gone to on your own. I probably would not have found my way there, had it not been for the tour. It was really cool.There are a lof of very cool buildings too. You get to see some really cool street art and graffiti ,from various artists. The guides are knowledgeble and tell you about the different artists as well as the techniques used in the paintings. Unfortunately 3 hours are not enough, Buenos Aires has so much cool street art to offer. You could probably walk around for a week and still find new art.This tour is a must for the graffiti /street art enthusiasts."

If I'm a street artist I'm not sure if people making more money off a single tour than I earn on single \"painting\" would make me too excited. I'm told that some of the money helps fund other projects, so I guess that's a good thing.Our guide was did do some meaningful interpretations of the works but it would have been nice if she started with some context for street art more broadly and as it applies locally. I would have liked some historical context. Some of the works were impressive but I somehow expected to a be a little more wowed. It's funny, the next day I went to one of the local museums here, the Malba, where they are doing a retrospective of Antonia Berni, and it reminds you of the vast chasm between the greats and these street artist. I guess, lacking more talent, that's pretty much what you've got left. Don't get me wrong, I love Banksy and some of the others, it's just that this work doesn' t seem to come close, fairly underwhelming. Not sure this stuff quite rises to the level of a tour."

Our tour guide, Matt, was very knowledgeable and passionate on the subject of street art. It would have been difficult to find these murals on our own and he explained the different artists and their work. After the tour, we asked Matt for the location of certain giant murals we had seen on their website and not covered during the tour and he emailed us very detailed instructions which was helpful. Our only regret was that we did this tour on the last weekend of our stay in Buenos Aires. Had we done this on the first weekend, we would have probably have spent some time searching out the stunning works of Martin Ron or even organized a private tour to seek them out. Must do!"

He was very knowledgeable, flexible on the tour, and took us to a couple local establishments along the way for ice cream during the tour and drinks afterwards. This is a wonderful, off-beat tour that took us into neighborhoods we may not have otherwise visited and informed us about a culture that we may not have otherwise learned about.

And it was an excellent choice! Buenos Aires is full of amazing street art but I would never have found the mural we've seen during the tour nor I would know about their background and the history of street art movement in BA. Since the weather was terrible the group was very small (me + 3 more people) which was actually great as we felt comfortable and could ask all the questions. The tour took us to areas of Buenos Aires I would never have visited on my own as they were fairly far from the center - another advantage of the tour as I could see also some random yet nice parts of BA. Despite the bad weather we got to see pretty many cool murals by various artists and heard the story behind each of them. Matt, our guide, also explained a lot about various technics used in street art, something I didn't know much about before. The tour lasted over 2 hours and was extremely informative, it was clearly seen that street art is a big passion of Matt (he even published a book about it) and he was willing to share his knowledge. Afterwards we all spent another 2 hours in the cafe, chatting even more about street art in BA and all over the world.If you're into street art and alternative things don't miss this trip, you'll enjoy it for sure! It's the best way to learn more about street art in Buenos Aires!"

I went on the BA Street Art Tour last Saturday afternoon and had one of the most interesting and enjoyable days I\u2019ve had in the city so far. It was fun and I felt like I got to experience something completely new.The tour combined the best aspects of visiting a modern art gallery (exposure to cool innovative artworks) with the fun of being out and about exploring the hidden parts of a city (one of my favourite things to do when visiting any new place).Learning the stories and history behind each of the pieces was fascinating and the sheer scale of some of these artworks needs to be seen to be believed. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and friendly and I met some great people on the tour.I just loved it. Highly recommended day out."

This is a fantastic way to experience a different side of the city and escape the crowds of the typical tourist traps. Whether you are living in the city or visiting for a weekend, I would highly recommend the tour. We were shown a range of street art from those covering 5 story buildings to hidden gems on street corners. This really is a fantastic way to see another side of the city and to experience some of the most impressive street art in the world. Our guide Matt was very knowledgeable and as a novice I learned a lot about street art per se, the artists (who came from all over the world), and the context of street art in Buenos Aires. The tour was really well organised and I was able to enjoy the street art in a relaxed and fun atmosphere. I will certainly be taking my friends along when they visit!"

Wenzel is a dynamic guide who really understands the culture of street art in BA as he is a street artist himself. He is a native German who speaks excellent English and Spanish and was able to get his message across easily to both the English and German speaking tourists. The street art itself is really interesting, of a personal and political nature and the tour covers an area of the city I would never have gone to on my own. This tour is an excellent use of 3 hours and very good value."

My wife and I booked a 3 hour private tour with Matt in late March 2014 on our last full day in Buenos Aires, and we absolutely loved it! First of all, the booking process was extremely easy and I was able to reserve our tour via email in English. BA Street Art Tours were excellent to communicate with, accepted payment via paypal, and went out of their way to accommodate our schedule by picking us up after lunch at La Brigada steakhouse in San Telmo and dropping us off at our hotel in Palermo after the tour. Matt was an excellent guide, very laidback but also extremely knowledgeable about the street art scene in Buenos Aires. He actually co-authored an excellent book on BA street art, which I subsequently purchased after returning home. We also enjoyed hearing him speak fluent Spanish, but with his native English accent.Following Matt's directions, our private driver drove us to numerous neighborhoods in BA that we would never have had a chance to visit otherwise. There was a protest in the city that day, and Matt was able to avoid the closed roads and traffic so that we didn't waste our time sitting in gridlock. He knew exactly where to go to view some of the most amazing street art that we have ever seen. His enthusiasm and his obvious appreciation of the art and the artists who created it enabled him to make the scene come alive for two novices who knew very little about street art prior to the tour. He was a fountain of information about the origin of the various pieces, the significance, the public reception, and the artists backgrounds.Although some of the neighborhoods visited on the tour were a little shady, at no point did we feel unsafe, and only once did we decide to return to the car rather than continue walking down a street towards a group of men who were drinking on the corner and eyeing us somewhat suspiciously. As Matt said, we were seeing the \"real Buenos Aires,\" and not just the areas that tourists normally visit.We took a lot of photos of the art and of ourselves in front of the art. Matt was very patient and encouraged us to take pictures, took some pictures for us with my camera, and even took some photos of us with his much more sophisticated camera (and his more advanced photography skills). He shared his photos with us in a follow-up thank you email a couple of days after the tour, which again, was a nice touch and much appreciated. During the tour, we (obviously) talked a lot about art, but also about history, politics, the various neighborhoods, bars and restaurants, etc. The time seemed to fly by, and it was interesting to get Matt's perspective on life in BA. Matt's friendly demeanor and conversational tone made it feel like a casual guided tour given by a local friend or acquaintance.We would highly recommend taking this tour as a way to see some great art, explore some of the more \"off the beaten path\" areas of the city, and get a different perspective of BA than the average guided tour would offer. Even after giving our driver (who was also excellent) a tip, we found the experience to be well worth the price. If you're thinking about it, just take the tour- you won't regret it!"

            "review": "This awesome, non-touristy tour gives you a real (and photo-friendly) angle on BsAs. Buenos Aires is not a \"tourist-attraction\" city. To really get a flavor for the place, you have to hit the streets, open your eyes, and observe the city for what it is - a colorful contrast of nostalgia and transience, optimism and cynicism, rawness and a bohemian sensibility that's rooted in Latin identity but that can seem disconcertingly fashion-forward at times. Not sure you'll pick up on all that in your 7 day itinerary weaving past the Obliesco? Fear not: Matt and Wenzel's tour of BA's most striking works of street art not only takes you to cool, off-the-beaten-track corners of the city: it tells the story of the place and it's creative allure in a way that few BsAs tours really can. The guides (the aforementioned Matt and Wenzel) are smarties, enthusiastic, engaging hosts, and best of all, artists themselves, so you're guaranteed to get thoughtful, funny and KNOWLEDGEABLE explanations of how the art you see came to be: the philosophy/politics/inspiration behind it, how the work was executed, the planning involved and, often times, cool stories about how the neighborhood reacted to the piece. Some artists are local, but many too are international, and Wenzel and Matt will give you the scoop on why so many underground artists are drawn to BsAs. Pro tip: you'll spend about 2 hours walking, and though it's flat, you'll wanna bring comfy shoes. And DEFINITELY tote a camera with you, as you'll probably snap some of your trips raddest and most award-winning photos on this tour. Not to be missed."

They take you to areas you wouldn't otherwise see as a tourist and since going on the tour, I have really started to look around me more in the city. It was also fascinating going on the tour again and seeing how the street art had changed, it really shows what a dynamic, vibrant and accessible artform it is.

You get to see parts of the city that you wouldn't otherwise go to and view amazing street art (not graffiti). Our guide, Wenzel, told us not just about the specific art pieces we saw, but also about street art in general and the street art scene in Buenos Aires. We also got to see an artist doing a new piece and relaxed in a bar after the tour. It's also a nice way to meet fellow travelers and swap stories. Excellent value for your money!!"

I loved this 2.5 hour tour.The places we went to were just amazing given that most of the street art is not in high profile areas and thus, its a bit hard to find them and also, ever evolving.I wish the tour was much longer since I enjoy street art so much. I think this should become an all day tour."

Having lived in BA for four years and explored many of its neighborhoods, I thought there wasn't too much I was missing out on. But Matt Fox-Tucker and his tour showed me a side of Buenos Aires I had never seen--not just the rarely-visited residential area of Villa Urquiza, but the life and story behind the many street murals there and the artists who create them. I was surprised to see that this organization not only offers tours of the graffiti art and street murals, but also takes an active hand in their creation, working with the city government and the local artists to arrange the painting of abandoned buildings and walls with undesirable scribblings. BA Street Art proposed and backed the largest street mural in the city--a breathtakingly bizarre one by Martin Ron (part of which is pictured here). One of many highlights in an eye-opening new window into the city. Definitely make it a part of your BA stay."

The enthusiasm of the guides is infectious and their knowledge is outstanding. We were glad to walk through some residential neighborhoods that we normally would not have gone to and learn not only about the artwork and the artist but also the various techniques used in the creation of the piece. Matt is really friendly and the tour ends in a nice bar with art by Martin Ron. I finished the tour with far more appreciation of street art. I highly recommend this tour for anyone interested in art in an outdoor setting."

As a first-time visitor, I was surprised to see how much graffiti there was in Buenos Aires, a lot of it political, some of it artistic, much of it intriguing, but I did not have any context to understand it.The tour was great because we saw prominent artists' works, in situ, and we got knowledgeable explanations from our guides about them. They also had interesting commentary about the Argentine political situation and related political graffiti. The experience was way better than an art museum tour -- the museum is the streets themselves.I knew nothing about street art before the tour besides having a passing familiarity with Banksy. But the tour guides passed along such great background and made the subject accessible. I ended up buying their excellent book and I brought home a new appreciation of this art form in my own hometown in the USA."

Buenos Aires has a lot of incredibly talented street artists who aren't necessarily part of the traditional art circuit of galleries and museums. Their work is scattered around the city, especially in the suburbs, where mural painting is facilitated by the presence of big white walls and neighbours amenable to the addition of local colour. For most visitors to the city, however, knowing where to look and what to focus on can be a challenge \u2013 it can be intimidating to get to know street art culture if you're not a part of it. That's where this fantastic tour comes in.Matt, the tour leader, is a great speaker who is passionate about street art, well connected with local artists, and a really nice guy. His talks are full of juicy information: from the history of the artwork, to local artistic feuds, to preferred brands of aerosol. He sheds light on the nuances between 'street art' and 'graffiti', while unerringly guiding his flock (a mix of locals and tourists) around lesser-known barrios of the city like Villa Urquiza.Street art is an essential and thriving part of Buenos Aires culture, and this tour is one of the best-run, most organised ways of getting to know it. Not to be missed."

Matt went above and beyond any tour I have taken in the past.If you are a fan of street art, and have the chance to travel to BA, I highly recommend this tour. You won't be disappointed!"

He really knows a lot about the history of street art, not just in B.A. but generally, and certainly knows the scene in B.A. very well. We enjoyed visiting some different neighborhoods that we probably would not have seen otherwise, and loved learning about the various styles and artists whose work we would later see throughout the city. Definitely recommend this tour."

I had realized some great street art here before, but had no idea the variety and extent of it. Matt was super helpful not only with his street art expertise, but also with suggestions for other things to do and places to eat in the city. I typically hate tours and 'touristy' type things, but this is a can't-miss whether you're visiting for a short time or you've been here for years - it definitely opened my eyes to a whole new part of Buenos Aires."

Matt's excitement was contagious and he did a great job of taking us through the streets at a comfortable pace so that we could see as much as possible. He had the transportation planned perfectly and was always keeping track of us to make sure we didn't wander off or step in anything unpleasant (lots of dogs in the park!). He even had umbrellas for us when it started to sprinkle, and bug spray when the mosquitos would occasionally land on any of us for a snack :) The Street Art scene in Buenos Aires is incredible, and I left anxious to learn more about the various artists ~ I even follow one of them on Facebook now! We were in Argentina attending a conference, and the tour came highly recommended from a few of the attendees. I wouldn't say I was excited to go at first, but it ended up being one of my favorite days in Buenos Aires! Matt did an awesome job!"

I've been living in Buenos Aires for almost a year now on a university placement and I can say that the tour I went on with BA street art tours is easily one of the best things I've done during my time here. The excellent guide Matt gave us an in-depth view into the world of graffiti and street art in BA, and more specifically about the artists and how they do their work. We travelled through areas of the city that I'd never been to, and I found that it was a great way to get to know BA. Before the tour I didn't know much at all about street art in general, but since I've been inspired to write a uni essay on the graffiti and street art of Buenos Aires. The artwork is incredible, the guide is brilliant, it's a must-do!"

The best thing is that you can ask Matt all the questions you like and that you get to see many interesting pieces of art. I was glad I took the tour at the beginning of my stay, because afterwards I started to recognize the work of specific artists wondering around the different barrios of Buenos Aires myself. Really cool. Don't hesitate and just book the tour. I recommended it to a lot of my classmates as I was taking a Spanish course in Buenos Aires and they all liked it very much."

They not only seemingly know the intricacies and politics of the local scene they positively encourage it too, working daily with Writers and home owners to find new wall space. The tour gives a great insight into the current local and global scene (many international Writers come to paint in BA). The guys' passion is Street Art, but if you're more into traditional Writing you will not be disappointed, there are some superb pieces of both types. I lost count of the amount of pics I took!

Even though I had zero knowledge of street art & graffiti I felt that I learnt a lot about the history and culture surrounding the street art- one of the coolest things is that Matt actually knows the artists themselves, and thus exactly what the artists were expressing. We saw works that were only days old due to Matt\u2019s local knowledge, so the whole experience felt very genuine and unique.

Doing some kind of Streetart tour in Buenos Aires (one of the most important places for streetart in latinamerica and worldwide as you can find high quality streetart around the whole city) is a very recommended activity while your stay in Buenos Aires. I checked out the options and came out with BA Street Art Walking Tours. Already my first impression was really positive. They maintain a very informative website (http://www.buenosairesstreetart.com) and facebook group where you can already get a lot of information in advance. Moreover my contact over mail was answered soon, uncomplicated and with all the information I needed. So I joined the walking tour which left the oncoming day (10.01.2013). The tours are leaving at 3pm and last almost 3h. They charge 100ARS or around 20USD.The guide - Matt - speaks english and is highly knowledgable about streetart in general and specially about the streetart scene in Buenos Aires and its obvious he has first-hand knowledge about streetart art in whole Buenos Aires like not many more. He moved to Buenos Aires in 2009 and published a book about streetart in Buenos Aires (Textura dos) together with a brazilian photographer.The tour starts in the eastern part of Palermo (Colegiales Train station) from where you take the train to the Saavedra barrio. Most of the tour takes place in this barrio. Matt shows you a lot of awesome artworks by international and national artists (like Blu, Jaz, Gualicho, Malegria, Pum-Pum, Pelado) and tells you the history about every work. Moreover you get an introduction to streetart in general and about streetart in Buenos Aires (historical facts, legal situation, artists). No matter if you already have knowlege about streetart (in Buenos Aires) you will learn a lot on this tour and its more than worth the money you spend. And you can be sure your money goes to a good cause and its the least to support these two guys for all their work they have done so far and still are doing and all the artists behind that keep the streetart alive in Buenoa Aires. During the tour you can place any questions you may have and you can be sure to get a deep answer. At the end of the tour you get a sheet with a list of the most important artists and their websites/blogs/flicks accounts and some more sots in buenos aires with important artworks.I can't recommend this tour enough if you have a half day in buenos aires and it was by far the best activity in this city. Do this tour as its awesome their is such a good link between the streetart around the city and foreign tourists.Some points that could be optimized in my opinion: The tour could be made later the day (the hours before sunset) so there would be better light conditions for photographies and at some points the tour was a little bit in a hurry so it was not always possible to give the works the time they deserve."

One of the greatest views of Buenos Aires! this was not only a tour but a pedagogical view of street art in the city through the great explanations given by Matt. He told us specific details about the street arts-graffittis and murals and also stories about some of the artists!. It is also good to know that he actually wrote a book about Street Art in B.A that made me feel that he really knows about the subject and he is totally committed to doing it!"

This is a great way to dive into the wealth of street art that is out there, explore new parts of the city that you may not get to otherwise, meet new people, make new friends, and to have a fantastic time while doing it! Matt's wealth of knowledge about the street art scene is quite impressive, so remember to pepper him with loads of questions! After the tour, your perspective of the city will change, and you will constantly be scanning the walls as you go around in buses, taxis, or on foot."

Before I left Buenos Aires luckily a friend of mine shot me a message if I would be up to join a Buenos Aires graffiti tour with him. I agreed and found myself on this tour the next day, discovering new neighbourhoods of B.A. I had not visited yet.The tour itself was great: the guy who runs the tours has a big knowledge about Street Art and even more intersting for newbies: he could tell the story behind those graffitis and gave a lot of information about the artist and the Street Art Scene in general. Based on a 6 month research of the scene down there these guys also wrote a book and can tell a lot of stories about B.A. as well - an excellent value for the money spent. Moreover I saw a different side of B.A. than just the typical tourist spots in San Telmo, La Boca or Palermo."

It is well known that Buenos Aires has produced many great artists, especially in literature, music and the film industry but it is fascinating to find out that nowadays the talent of many \"porte\u00f1os\" is producing not just very fine street art but also an exciting point of encounter and opportunities for many international artists. Moreover, I guess I am not the only one who had the idea that Argentines were rather sensitive to art and innovative forms of expression and such an idea has been gratefully confirmed by those citizens (and I believe even some local authorities) who are embracing and supporting the effort and amazing creations of street artists.In addition, the art street scene provides perfect evidence on how blurry the line is between street culture and art as most people think about it.The tour is great and one of the activities a tourist should not miss in Argentina. Finally, the tour guide is excellent and someone who can teach you many interesting things."

We had a great time walking around some of the BA neighborhoods and Matt was very knowledgeable about the artists, the street art scene and where to go. He came prepared with sun screen and bug spray, which neither of us thought of bringing. What was really great is that Matt was flexible with his timing given that we had to change the time of our tour due to airline delays. Overall, we enjoyed the walking tour. Perhaps the only thing we would have changed is that we would have liked to see more street art/murals and less graffiti, however, this just can't be controlled all the time!We saw some amazing murals and we did love our tour. If you are not an avid street art fan, I would say do a regular, shorter group tour over the private, 3hr long tour. We loved it, but it's not for everyone!"

Matt, our guide, was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the BA street art scene. In our close to 3-hour walking tour, we've seen many different types of street art and heard about the subculture. It's also interesting to hear about the individual artists, the commercialization of street art, the vandalism and enforcement, and well, the aerosol vs. paint debates. We even saw some art from our hometown artists! It is a very informative tour and while I am probably no closer at being able to tell between the painting styles, I know a bit more about this somewhat controversial art form. Just remember to bring bug spray (luckily Matt had some) and sunscreen.If you are looking for something different to do in this massive city, take a look at BA Street Arts Walking Tour. Matt keeps a blog that has more information about the scene and the artists."

It soon became quite apparent that we were taking the train 3 stops out of town to see some of the best street art in Argentina (and perhaps Latin America). Matt, our guide is a Brit who left the BBC (he was an announcer) and gives tours on street art. He also co-wrote a wonderful book on street art (he actually wrote it while a friend took the photos). He is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. He is also concerned about our safety which made it easier to concentrate on the art. He showed us various artists and explained the difference between street art, grafitti, vadelismo (vandalism) and stencil art. He knew exactly where to go to find the newest art. Believe me, I have walked up and down Dorrego Street every day and yesterday a new piece of street art was painted! This tour is a MUST!!!5stars Matt!"

Not only that we saw some spectacular paintings, drawings, prints, etc. bejeweling the otherwise gray buildings at Buenos Aires, but we also saw how the locals live. Most of the good art is located out of the pretty and polished city centre so we got to know the town well.In South America it is hard to find an English speaking (very-well english speaking) guides, but Matt (originally from the UK) spoke fluently thus we got a maximum out of our tour. He was friendly and answered all our questions without hesitating. I recommend this tour to anyone who has three spare hours in BA."

I had been to one in Berlin and was impressed with the talent that lies on and in between the bricks and concrete of the city.I searched for walking graffiti tours prior to arriving (Oct06-15) in Buenos Aires. What appealed to me about Buenos Aires Street Art Tour was the professionalism of the website and the detail of information I received when I inquired about the tour--I was sent all the necessary information that helped me quickly make my decision to attend.I booked myself and went on what turned out to be the best decision coupled with beautifully comfortable weather.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOUR. The art and tour was vibrant, informative, and also felt personal. I've acquired a new found respect for true street art. Our guide, Matt, was exceptional. I am in awe of his enthusiasm and knowledge of both the artists, their history, their works of art and the city of Buenos Aires. We were taken to a part of Buenos Aires that I likely would not have ventured into partly because it was not on the tourist map. Definitely an off the beaten track/path tour. And a bonus--we got to stop for delicious empanadas.I also picked up the book Textura Dos: Buenos Aires Street Art and it sits on my coffee table proudly displayed and admired. Unlike other forms of art that are stationary (on canvas, paper, framed, or whatever surface), street art can vanish and vanish quickly leaving it a distant memory. The book manages to capture the art, the artists, neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires and more importantly, it captures the experience.One regret was not congregating with the street artists at the local graffiti festival in La Plata. Well done. Encore."

My husband and I live here and in an effort to always try something new with our visitors, we took this tour over this past weekend. We got to really understand both the graffiti art scene and a part of Buenos Aires that we really didn't know much about. Also, it provided a great way to show our guests other parts of the city and the real BA, not just the Plaza de Mayo or Palermo SoHo. I would recommend this tour to other people and definitely will send other guests who are interested in learning more about street art!"

The walk is like an art museum tour that takes you around the city to see the best murals. Matt taught us about different themes, styles and trends in the street art movement and shared fascinating ideas and stories about this emerging art movement. Came away from this tour very knowledgeable on the trends. Matt's passion for the subject is contagious. Great tour - would definitely recommend it."

Very very informative and enthusiastic. Also friendly and extremely courteous and polite. I have lived in Buenos Aires for some time now and I decided to go on the tour on impulse really as I have seen all these huge murals over the city and always wondered if there was some kind of story behind them. Turns out there is. What I didn\u2019t expect to see was part of the city that I had never been to before. Its more of a tour of street art - it is a fascinating insight into the heritage and culture of the city with plenty of anecdotes and information which really made the city come alive. When it was finished I felt as if I knew the city much better than when I had started off. Besides that even if you\u2019re not interested in street art it is really a cool way to spend a morning or afternoon walking around Buenos Aires with a really enthusiastic guide at the helm who really has a great love for this city. He also seems to personally know many of the artists involved which of course makes all the difference!"

Matt brought us to neighborhoods that you would normally not venture into if you were just visiting Buenos Aires, and he showed us a variety of work by both amateur artists and seasoned street artists. His explanations and stories are detailed and very interesting! He is definitely the go-to guy for street art. Do this tour! It's a MUST."

The BA Street Art tour is a must for intrepid visitors in search of an alternative introduction to the city, especially for those wishing to acquire an understanding of its art, life and politics, that goes beyond the superficial. It helped us notice and comprehend particular details throughout our stay which we might otherwise have overlooked. Matt is an amiable and knowledgeable guide. As a journalist from an artistic background he has been faithfully documenting this vibrant arts scene over several years; interviewing the artists and archiving his finds with great attention to detail. Having gained the trust and friendship of the artists, he offers a keen insight into their work. The artists themselves now contact Matt with news of their latest pieces. He is sharp-eyed for what\u2019s best and what\u2019s fresh. Particularly striking is the work of Jaz which is emblematic of the BA psyche and the individual at loggerheads with the system. Matt was happy to tailor the tour to suit the specific interests of our group, and even offered further assistance for research purposes to one of our group. His tour was a highlight of our visit.In organising these tours, Matt is not exploiting the work of others, but is trying to promote them, and raise their profile both within Buenos Aires and beyond. His book \u2018Textura Dos\u2019 is beautifully illustrated and makes a memorable souvenir."

He gives a great description and point of view to nearly all the pieces of art that you see on the tour (which is more than plenty) and really helps you to further appreciate some of the intricate details of the artwork.

On a recent trip to Buenos Aires, a beautiful, friendly, vibrant and diverse city, I had the great pleasure to attend one of Matt's walking tours. An exceptional deal by any standard, the BA Street Art Walking Tours will take you to parts of the city you may have overlooked and will grant you access to some of the best art in the city. Matt is a fantastic guide and though he may not be from BA, he is a great ambassador for the city. Matt's knowledge of the murals, tags, and stencils that comprise most of the city's street art seems inexhaustible and his willingness to field any question is proof of his experience with and proximity to the scene. The Tuesday that a friend and I attended the tour was a city holiday and turned out to be the perfect day to take the tour. Matt was a great guide from the start, quick to point out work from both local and international artists and glad to explain the history of individual pieces and the street art scene as a whole whenever a question arose. The work is ever changing so even if you've seen some of the work on trips through the city, it would be to your benefit to lace up your sneakers and hit the streets with Matt. He has, after all, literally written the book on the subject. Plan your next trip to Argentina around Matt's walking tour schedule, you will not be disappointed."

Matt gives a great tour of street art in neighborhoods I would not have gone to on my own because they aren't the neighborhoods with any of the other big sites. The art and the stories of the artists behind the art are pretty fascinating. Because street art changes so much, it's sort of like revealing a historical mystery when you hear the story of something recently painted over and the new story of what's painted on top. I know that sounds uber dramatic but it was really my first deep exposure to street art and it was really fun. Matt is super friendly and I met cool people on the tour as well. Highly recommend."

I knew very little about street art/graffiti/vandalism, but became intrigued by some of the cooler works I had seen while walking around in Palermo Hollywood so decided to go with a few of my friends. Matt, the tour guide, led us through all kinds of different neighborhoods of Buenos Aires to get an idea of what is considered vandalism, tagging, graffiti style, and street art. It wasn't just a tour walking around Buenos Aires with a guy who knows where there is cool graffiti to look at...it was a thorough explanation of all the different elements that embody this subculture from a guy who clearly understands it. Needless to say, the art itself was very impressive and I walked away with a completely different view of the different attitudes towards the practice, the individual styles of both local and world-renowned artists, the different forms and purposes of street art in BA, the unique cultures that exist in every city as it relates to their laws, and much more. Bottom line, if you want to see some different parts of BA that you probably will not go to, want to learn something completely different about the culture here, want to look at lot of talented urban art and understand more about it, or want to come away with some cool pictures to share with others, then I would highly recommend this tour. It is well worth every peso!"

With that said, if you have the same doubts, this really is the perfect tour for you. Matt is incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. Artists go to him first to tell him of new projects so he is constantly \"in the know.\" Matt goes out of his way to make the tour comfortable (introducing people by first name, ensuring breaks) and takes you to places in BA you would not stumble on your own. I even spent an hour with Matt after the tour having lunch talking about his interest in Art. I learned a ton. MY only advice is that be prepared for a long tour. Matt is passionate and you will see countless examples or art. Remember, each tour is unique because the art is constantly changing. This tour is not for those who want an overview of the city of BA. But for my second visit to this great city, this was a terrific way to get of the tourist path and see the true colors of the city. Thank you Matt. Your book sits on my coffee table."

We stumbled upon Matt's website when we were planning our trip to Argentina and knew straight away that it was one of the things we should definitely do. From the outset Matt was quick to reply to our emails and we had all of the information we needed.On the day of our tour we travelled the short distance from Palermo to the cafe he suggested we meet at (he provided plenty of travel advice so you'd have no problem getting there safely) and he was waiting for us with a warm welcome.After a brief introduction the six tourists and Matt jumped on the train at the nearby Colegiales station (he'd arranged our tickets and this was included in the price) we rode for two or three stops to the Saavedra. We were then shown amazing street art from the moment we stepped off of the train. Following Matt at a brisk pace (decent shoes are recommended) we were shown one amazing piece of artwork after another and, at each piece, Matt gave us some interesting insight into the creator of the work as well as the creative meaning behind the piece and the techniques involved. Originally a journalist from the UK he clearly does a lot of research and he really knows his stuff. As part of the popular blog he runs (http://www.buenosairesstreetart.com/) he regularly interviews the artists and has first-hand knowledge of the street-art scene that few people have access to. It was also clear to us that he had a true passion for his work and as soon as the tour had finished he was travelling to another area of the City to document a brand new piece of work he had just heard about.The tour lasted for about 2.5 hours, which was a really good length, and at the end we were given guidance about the best way to return to our respective areas of Buenos Aires.If you have an interest in art of any kind then I can't recommend this tour highly enough. It was fascinating and Matt's enthusiasm and huge knowledge of his chosen subject made the tour one of the best experiences of our month-long trip."

My wife and I went to BA for 3-weeks and the 1st 3-days were spent with Joy (2 of the Days were 1/2 Day Tours and then on July 9th (their Independence Day) we did a separate Tour to enjoy & begin to understand their Special Day). I would really recommend that (if you have the time) 2 1/2-Days is the way to see and learn Buenos Aires . . . .and Joy is the person to do it, she knows and loves Buenos Aires and it's history!Even after the Tours, Joy offered us help and some advice to make sure that our overall experience was perfect !!!!!!!!!!!!!!All-in-all, this is the best Tour we have ever taken . . . . and we have traveled and toured the world."

Lovely bubbly personality joy was very helpful when I found myself with a Credit card that wouldn't work in the regular bank machines. Once we had that problem sorted we set out on our city tour. Her knowledge, enthusiasm and advice were very much appreciated. In fact her helpful notes and tips about where to go in my free time gave me the confidence to explore on my own."

From the time we met Joy at our hotel in Palermo we experienced genuine warmth, an unhurried tour by taxi, walking and bus along with plenty of knowledge about BA and Argentina as well as personal conversation. I wish we had the opportunity to spend more time with Joy but she is so popular we could not. As it was Joy gave us much more than the time we had booked. What a delight she is and what a perfect way to spend our first day in Buenos Aires. Thanks Joy and we highly recommend you to anybody who wants a great and personal experience.

My husband and I have traveled extensively and no tour has come close to providing so much fun, local color, insight into a country's people and history as well as assistance!!!!!! Joy immersed us in local color with a trip to watch the sortija (a wonderful weekly competition by caballeros on horseback), a BBQ with all the traditional foods, and people dancing in the street on Independence Day.She showed us the way to take the metro and bus, helped us buy our cards to use on both methods of transportation and advised us of any cautions necessary. She is a delightful young woman who has contacted us several times since the end of our full day and 2 half days of tours, just to be sure things are going well for us. I cannot recommend her tour company more highly. It was truly a Joy!!!!!!!!Sharon UptonScottsdale AZ"

Joy was the 1st lady to be recommended as a truly awesome local guide. She didn't disappoint. Often, city tours can become boring & disengaging after a while, this was different. From start to finish (honestly didn't want tour to end) she was wonderful. Joy is so passionate about her city. By the end of the tour, I had inherited some of that enthusiasm & love of Buenos Aires.

It was amazing, we made some empanadas (the best I've ever had)and few other things. We had some wine, we ate what we have made and we chat all day long.

We share some mate tea and to be honest we talked about just anything.The following day we had a city tour with Joy.We've seen amazing places, we found out great facts from Argentinian history, we had some great food and all with a lot of fun.We'll recommend Joy to anyone.

I wanted to see Buenos Aires from a local's point of view and from someone knowledgeable on all that this amazing city has to offer. A friend recommended Joy and to be honest I was very impressed, beyond what I was hoping for. I considered a free tour, but the lack of 'the personal touch' of these large group tours did not appeal. This is something you get in bucket loads with Joy! From the outset you appreciate how much passion she has for her home town and her depth of knowledge is really quite impressive! Joy was very accommodating in making sure that the tour included the key areas I wanted to see, and shaped it around local events to ensure we did not miss anything going on, and I came away more knowledgeable on this great city and very happy with the way the tour was organised and delivered. Communication leading up to the tour was spot on too, Joy could not be more helpful!Following on from my tour of BA, I booked the Drum Workshop that Joy also offers. I had been somewhat inspired by the spine-tingling sounds of the drums that you often hear around the streets and suburbs of Buenos Aires (plus the percussion show 'La Bomba De Tiempo' which is stunning and sealed the deal for me...!), so thought that the workshop would be a great follow-on experience. Again, I was not disappointed! Not being musically talented in the least and lacking in the rhythm department, I initially thought that it might not quite be for me, but nothing ventured, nothing gained....Our workshop host Diego, soon put any concerns at ease as we learned about the origins of the music of Argentina and in particular the various drums that you would hear around Argentina and even Uruguay. Soon we were having a 'jam' session on the drums and Diego quickly instilled rhythm that I didn't know I had...! I had such a fun and engaging experience that I even asked for the names of the drums that I liked the most so that I can buy some on my return to the UK. My neighbours will love me..! :)All in all, I can highly recommend the guided tour and drum workshop, both arranged with Joy, and when I return to Buenos Aires later this year, I have discussed further tours with Joy, including a Tango Experience and a visit to one of the local futbol matches, to complete the whole experience. As a guide and host, you will not find better than Joy, and I felt compelled to write an honest review as she really makes you feel like a friend rather than a customer. A++++++ Clive from Scotland."

The firehall has museum pieces and new equipment.All firefighters in Argentina are volunteers The Boca Jr. Stadium re: 12 player The graffiti wall about the disappeared The immigrants bridge The memorial under the bridge for the disappeared who's personal effects were found when the police station was torn downThe old tenements in La Boca which are now stores but you can see where whole families lived in boxes.Another good coffee house. Coffee comes with a glass of water and small cookies. Milk costs extra. I love the little snacks and water especially because it was very hot.We saw the Rosa ! San Martin's crypt, The British flags taken when Argentina defeated Britain.The embassy for France, BritainWe walked and rode the busesGrabbed an empanada.......and moreAs we made our way down Defense to Plaza de Mayo we first stopped and Joy explained about Mate and made us some. I liked it very much.Then we began to meet union people. There was/is a big protest today over wages and a large number of people being fired from the government. We stopped and chatted with some. Joy lead us further and we met many leaving the plaza as their part was done. The plaza was still packed with people and it was a little overwhelming. Joy says this is only a small protest and we would be fine. The only time to worry is if the police get threatening. Also don't worry about big bangs it us only fireworks.Joy is energetic, articulate, knowledgeable and very proud of her wonderful city. Thank you Joy."

She was SO helpful and lovely from the moment we got in touch. It was so great to have local knowledge from a friendly and relatable person. She asked us about what types of activities we would like to do whilst in Buenos Aires and looked into different options and prices for us. These included Tango Shows, Yoga Classes, Bars and Restaurants, Walking Tours, Shopping, Gardens, Museums, Markets, History, Music Shows etc. Joy made a suggestion to do a drum workshop with a local drummer and also told us about a drum show that is really popular. We did the drumming workshop on a Monday afternoon and the show was on later that night. Joy met us in the city and showed us how to use the Subway system, which we used at least once a day for the rest of our trip. (So helpful) In the workshop we got to have some tea and chat about the history and culture of what drumming means to the locals. It was so nice to see the passion of our teacher Diego. We got to learn different rhythms and techniques and use a large variety of drums. Diego made us feel so welcome in his home (where the lesson takes place) and it was an amazing experience that not many tourists would get the opportunity to do. Later on, at the drum show we could really appreciate the drummers talents and understand the work of the 'conductors'. We had such a fun day and definitely recommend the workshop to anyone travelling to Buenos Aires. Joy is very professional and a beautiful soul who made our stay in Buenos Aires so much better. \u2764\ufe0f"

Choosing two days (with a break in-between) was the best decision we made, and the 16 hours we spent with Joy, in a wide variety of situations, simply revealed to us that she is undoubtedly pursuing her passion! And there's nothing better than having a guide/friend who seems as excited about her tours (ones she's done numerous times!) as you are. It makes a big difference!

Another traveller, Elizabeth from USA, joined me for the BA south area tour on 22.02.2016 to La Boca, Caminito, San Telmo & Mayo Square using also local bus.It was a great experience to have a personal tour & guide to get to know BA city this way with many local insider stories like the fire truck in Boca Juniors colours, how you really prepare/process Mate tea for drinking and sharing it with friends and other history lessons, very interesting !!!Joy is fantastic, passionate about BA and her country to show people around her city. She takes her time to answer all our questions and listens to what we are interested in.Joy is a lovely and amazing person, very dedicated tour guide and I recommend highly go on a tour \"BA with Joy\"!!!Joy, thank you soooo much, will always remember our tour and can say:\"Been there ... BA, done it ... tour with Joy, love it ... and will do it again whenever I return to BA\" "

Joy's passion, enthusiasm and dedication can be seen from the outset and she maintains this high level of service for the length of the tour, or in my case through back to back tours for the entire day! She is wonderful to talk to, her English is great and she is very knowledgeable but does not jabber - she notices if you aren't as interested in something and moves on to the next thing if so.Instead she takes the time and effort to engage with you and listens to what you need or want. I highly recommend her services and in particular, I would like to give a shout out to Diego and the drum workshop Joy facilitates with him. What an insightful and enjoyable experience, and I thought I was musically inept!"

There she told us on a map the must do's and local tips of Buenos Aires. We decided to do two tours with her (both for 4h). In the fist one we explored Retiro, Recoleta and Palermo. On the next day we went to la Boca and San Telmo. Both tours had a great mix of history, architecture, present political situation and personal experiences. It was a great way to get to know the city! Joy is a fantastic person, who loves to show her beautiful city and to help finding a great Tango place, transport to the airport or a great restaurant."

We appreciated this personal touch and getting to experience a small snippet of the life of the locals rather than simply being herded into some private transport as many tour companies do.All through the trip Joy's enthusiasm, infectious smile and bubbly personality really inspired us and kept our attention fully, eager for more interaction. She has the beautiful knack of giving information and telling stories of the local area, peaking your interest without overloading you or feeling like you're being preached at like some overbearing tour guides do.Joy really does give the tour a local, personal touch and very much encourages you to interact and ask questions - The stop at the fire station to see the special blue and yellow fire truck was a highlight!If I'm ever back in Buenos Aires - which I really hope I will be one day - I'll look up Joy for another fun day exploring the city!"

I went on a trip with Joy in 2014, travelling from her home town of Buenos Aires through to Rio as part of a small mixed tour group. Many of us are still friends to this day. Much of that was down to Joy\u2019s enthusiasm and attention to detail. Even on her days or evenings off, she still came out with the group as we wanted her with us. She has a great dry sense of humour and her local knowledge of where to go and experience the culture was second to none. You really felt you got the benefit of escaping the usual tourist traps and really seeing the city as it really is. She had a genuine interest in your life too and tailored the programme to what you wanted\u2026whether that was taking a tour of the Boca Juniors stadium, or watching some traditional dancing. Joy just wanted you to make the most of your trip and for you to enjoy yourself, without it being forced fun. To me that was important. A trip out kayaking, seeing Peron\u2019s grave, visiting a distillery or having a great meal was just as key as unwinding with a drink or two at the end of the day. Although I\u2019m sure she would have shown us every spot in town and told us every historical fact if she could, she understood that a holiday is also about a bit of R&R and so the pace of it all was just right. One last thing..Joy is a great photographer, so don\u2019t be surprised to come away with some good snaps as well as some great memories! Can\u2019t wait to go back some time and see my friend again."

She made us feel comfortable the entire time. We told her what we were looking for, and like magic, she made it happen. I learned so much history I would not have known without her. Truly, a behind the scenes look at what makes the city tick."

We had a few tour guides before we met Joy, and she really made the difference to our trip. She stood out above the rest by a mile. Joy is so much fun, energetic, knowledgable and by far the best travel guide we have both ever had. My husband had two stomach bugs that needed medical treatment and Joy would not leave us at the hospital, staying with us throughout both nights. She looked after a big group with skill and made our experiences and safety her priority at all times. Her passion for her country and sense of humor is one in a million. We were sad to say goodbye as Joy became a great friend to us."

We met Joy in the downtown plaza and her enthusiasm and knowledge about Buenos Aires was immediately evident. Although I knew some of the history from a previous tour, listening to Joy as she described historical events was the start of a great tour. Joy organised and paid for a local bus to La Boca, which is hard for tourists such as myself because a travel card is needed and my Spanish is limited. I received warnings from other people I met whilst traveling to be careful in La Boca as it was a 'dodgy place', but traveling with Joy I felt safe. She took us off the beaten path and we visited places I would not have seen if I went by myself. Listening to Joy was different, I wasn't expecting to learn so much about the city. She is from Buenos Aires and her tour was fun but professional at the same time."

Adam was completely professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and funny. We heard just the right amounts of information about the city and country's historical background, culture, architecture and so on, with some good anecdotes thrown in there. I felt like I came away understanding the city a little better, and had a number of new places in mind to go explore. He also gave us good practical information, such as using the Metro and changing money. Across the board, just a really good time and absolutely something you should do while in Buenos Aires. Also make sure you buy a dulce de leche milkshake... out of this world :)"

Yes, its a free tour and you are not obligated to pay anything. And he says it at the start. But it IS his job. We aren't high tipping people (we're Australian, we don't tip) but felt the fun informative tour was well worth the 100pesos we tipped. $15 bucks seemed fair for an over 3 hour tour. Thanks Adam. We will join you for your city tour as well. I must remember to bring a hat though. That heat is a killer!"

Friendly, informative, knowledgeable and engaging. When I go on a walking tour he's exactly what I expect from a guide. We enjoyed the tour so much that 2 days later we went on a second tour with Demasiado Tours in the north end of the city. We weren't originally going to do a tour of the cemetery but in the end i'm really glad we did because Adam had great knowledge of the people and stories of the Recoleta Cemetery. Yes you tip at the end of free walking tours but that is how the guides make their money. It is definitely worth it. They are called \"free\" walking tours because they are set up to appeal to all budgets and there is no guilt for how much you can or cannot afford to give. I think its a fantastic trade. Don't let the thought of tipping scare you away. DO the tour you won't be disappointed!"

In the end he gave us some great tips and answered al our questions. Of course at the end of the tour he suggested a tip, but that is highly usual for a 'free' walking tour (in every country) so you can pay whatever you think the tour is worth.

He was not a very engaging guide, he knew the \"encyclopedia\" information but the tour was simply repeting a script and information was not given in an intelligent way. The \"jokes\" were just cliches and not funny. We had a very long tour of 4 hours that was overwhelming and could be more enjoyable just if the explanations were better. The tour is supposed to be free, but the guide recommended us a tip pretending to anchor a set price for the tour with a very bad attitude. Definitely wouldn't be rushing back for another tour with these guys."

On the first morning in Buenos Aires we decided to take one of the free tours that are quite abundant in this town. We chose demasiado Just because it started at 10:30 while the others started at 11 and also because it seemed to be more comprehensive covering also San Telmo and Madero port while the others were doing mainly the center.I call only say that we were not disapointed. Alex, our young guide, spoke fluent English showed us all the sites providing us with more than enough information to make this a fruitfull introduction to the city and not a university course on Buenos Aires history and culture. The 4 hour tour took us through all them majot sites of the centro and some more. Alex was entertaining, informative as very helpful with all questions and requests.In addition the group was small (8 people) so all in all it was almost a private tour with fraction of the cost.I stronglt recommend Demasiado."

Neither of us had been to Buenos Aires before and we knew that we wanted at least one city tour (to get us better acquainted for our guide-less travel) as well as one non-city tour. We choose Tomas because of the Tripadvisor reviews and could not be happier with our choice (thanks Tripadvisor reviewers). We started with the City Walking Tour on our first full day in Buenos Aires. Tomas picked us up from our hotel and took us on quite the adventure. We began the tour with coffee and a brief history lesson, which Tomas tailored to our questions and interests. We then walked to Recoleta Cemetary where we received a personal and detailed description of the many monuments. We then made our way to La Boca, where we had lunch and walked around the markets, taking in the sites. We ended with a drive back to our hotel taking the longer route, where Tomas showed us various parts of the city that he'd recommend we visit. His recommendations were perfect. We ended up visiting many of those spots, including Palermo Soho, the following day. We had such an amazing time with Tomas that we decided to do another tour the following week. We ended up choosing the Delta Tour and had a blast on the boat. Tomas drove us to the boat where we ended up on a private, 2 hour ride along the Delta. He stopped at several points to let us take pictures and point out various sites of interests. Tomas then took us to a local spot, where we had coffee and watched families picnicking in the park. We ended the tour with the ideal picture spot--Tomas took us to an area where the city of Buenos Aires was the background to our last picture. Tomas clearly enjoys being a tour guide. His tours are personal, layered with family anecdotes and personal experiences. He's never rushed nor does he try to force you to a \"set\" agenda. He has an outline of the tour, but often asked us questions in an effort to tailor the sites to our preferences. We had an incredible time on both trips!"

Based on prior reviews, Tomas appeared to cater for a custom experience and I was not disappointed. Tomas incorporated my desire to visit La Boca, enjoy some excellent food and Malbec and tour the La Recoleta cemetery. What an awesome day focused entirely on me! Two days later Tomas invited me to travel to Lobos and Uribelarrea to experience the ranch lands and smaller towns. Amazing. By the end of our second tour I not only had an inspiring experience but a new friend. Thank you Tomas."

            "review": "5 star review for a 5 star guide. My wife and I did 3 tours with Bonaventura - 2 full day trips (city tour and ranch) and a half day to ESMA museum.There are many people organising tours of BA but I cannot believe any are better than Tomas. The city tour was very well planned, covered all the major sites in just about the right amount of detail and allowed enough flexibility to spend more time in places of particular interest (in my case Boca Juniors stadium). The ranch trip was also wonderful, and rounded off our 5 days in BA perfectly.However, what sets Bonaventura apart from the others is Tomas and the fantastic care he shows his customers. It was just like being shown around by a friend - he's a really funny guy, and a pleasure to spend time with. He also knows his stuff and, if he is not sure of anything, takes the time to find out (for example, ESMA is somewhere not many tourists go and he spent time with his colleague Juan doing research to ensure my visit went perfectly. How many other people would do that?)He also taught us a few phrases in Spanish which will be very useful for our future trips in South America.Save yourself a lot of time and effort and entrust Tomas with all your tours around BA.A great guide, an even nicer person."

( because of the fluctuation of the peso many tours like US dollars and give a discount vs credit card or pesos) . The tango tour had a special event for the date we were available and he refunded the money immediately. He found another tango show made reservations but found out that the place would take even less money if we paid directly to the show. The tour: He picked us up promptly , drove us around , showed us the many areas and was very flexible about places and time. He is quite passionate about the history of Argentina and had lots to say about it. . What was very interesting to me was we spoke a lot about the present political situation and the currency fluctuations with the Christina Kirchner vs the Marci governments/inflation and how Argentineans have to deal with it. The weather was very cold and time was running out so he told us he would show us the Recoleta Cemetery the next day . If you want a flexible private tour I would recommend this."

The horses were wonderfully responsive and you could tell that they were lovingly cared for. We actually were able to go on three rides since we were having so much fun.

My wife wanted some specific shoes (alpargatas) and clothes, and he knew exactly where to go to for her to get what she wanted (and at a really good price too).He speaks perfect English, is quite funny, and has a private car to take you everywhere. My only regret is not doing the tour earlier in our trip (we did it on the last day), as he pointed out lots of places we wished we could go back and visit and eat at."

Born and raised in Buenos Aires, he does a great job of giving both textbook and personalized history of the area. He is also hilarious and full of energy! We loved the boat tour, grabbing drinks and dessert at one of his favorite (and secluded) spots, and driving around the city. I was bummed that I didn't purchase some shoes at the market the day before and he brought us to the best place in the city to purchase them! I can't recommend him enough- it was the highlight of our week. We only wished we had scheduled our tour for one of our first days in city since he did such a great job of listing out areas we should see and restaurants where we should dine!"

We drove the 90 minute trip to San Antonio de Areco to visit the world famous silversmith (who gave us a private demonstration of his creative process). From there we went to the El Ombu ranch and had a very relaxing day of riding horses, eating a traditional Asado and relaxing by the pool. Tomas knew the hosts at the ranch and they took very good care of us. Tomas gave us a great history of Argentina, the Pompas region and Argentinean politics. He is very transparent and a lot of fun. We have 2 teenagers, and the loved his style and the information that he shared with us. By the end of the day, we have become good friends. We highly recommend Tomas for a Buenos Aires City tour, the Delta tour, or the Estancia tour."

We wanted to avoid the more touristic itineraries so I developed my own combining a visit to the Tigre Delta with a casual horse ride at the estancia Los Dos Hermanos in an adjoining province. Tomas was the only guide willing to work outside the square and we were so glad he was! Our party of four had a most memorable day thanks to all Tomas' efforts. He was an absolute joy - humorous, insightful and passionate about his local Delta area. We enjoyed a fabulous picnic lunch aboard his speedboat, complete with champagne, before heading off for the estancia. Tomas produced another lovely surprise for Sally who wasn't up for riding. We cannot speak highly enough about the quality of Tomas' services - he is fabulous. Tomas also recommended and booked a great Parrilla and Salon Canning Milonga for us - both were fantastic with a real 'local' flavour. Thank you Tomas!"

Thank you Thomas, you are such natural and sincere and funny guy...i still smile when i think of you - YEE HAA!P.S.

On our first day, we had a long layover in Buenos Aires, and when our plane was delayed Thomas was wonderful about helping us adjust our itinerary to things that we were interested in. Our next tour was the full day City Tour, and it was really a full day! Thomas knows his history and loves his city. This day we were with another couple and we all had a fabulous time. On the third day, Thomas took us to the Tigre and after a perfectly charming boat ride he dropped us at the airport. Thomas provides personal attention for small groups. Be aware that he is a fount of information and talks very very quickly, but if you only get half of what he says it will be twice as much as other tours. And you'll have a lot more fun. Highly recommend Thomas with Bonaventura!"

Hotel receptionist put us in contact with Tomas and he put together a fishing trip for us within that short time for a very reasonable price. He picked us up from the hotel about 8.30am and drove to the boat. All fishing gear with live bait were ready to go. Guy in the boat was also very friendly. We had a great time on the river fishing and enjoying the calm waters. He brought sandwiches and setup a nice picnic lunch on the boat. I enjoyed couple of beers and sandwiches he had prepared while my son did all the fishing. He caught 2 small catfish. Tomas, I still have the Cigar you gave me. I should smoke it one of these days, On the way back to hotel, he went out of the way to show us some nice neighborhoods. He didn't have to do this as it was not part of the trip. He genuinely enjoy the work he does, very knowledgeable and takes time to make his guests happy. Thank you very much for the great fishing trip and the company you provided for both of us.

Thomas has a good grasp of the English language, so conservation with him were great! The next day started at 9 am and covered the cemetery, the city proper and then on to La Roca for lunch. More sites and tea and a history lesson finished the day. Highly recommended. Thomas supplied a clean automobile, fuel, tolls and parking for a reasonable price of about $25/hr. He does his best to not offend anyone, least of all his customers.Stayed at the Bel Air Hotel at a very reasonable $65/night with a great breakfast and attentive English speaking reception staff."

After reading all previous positive comments, it was a no brainer that we wanted to try this tour. So 2 days after our arrival in BA we sent a email to Tomas. We had a prompt and complete reply including all relative infos. So we booked the tour by email, the day after, Tomas arrived at our hotel on time, punctual, for picking us as agreed. On top of that he was smily, friendly and he explained in details our day tour agenda. We felt safe and in good hand with him, trust was established from there. So we ride in their vehicle from San Telmo where we stayed to the Delta. From this point a true Buenos Aires history lessons started and that for the entire day. Tomas has so much culture he knows EVERYTHING about Argentina and South America! But the best is coming!After about 45 MINUTES we arrived at Tomas boat. A very comfortable, recent and well maintained bowrider 180. Their boat is perfect to discover the Delta because it allows us to go in all branch of the Delta even if water level is very low in some spot.In the Delta you feel like if your are in another world. We were so relaxed. no rush, no pressure and Tomas priority was our satisfaction. For lunch time Tomas stopped the boat in a bay with a stuning view of Buenos Aires.

He has a good idea where to take you but he also does a lot of spontainius stops where not to much tourists goes. We went with Tomas for 2 days and he was also very good with the baby. Even if we saw and learned a lot, for sure we will book a new trip with him when we go back to Buenos Aires!"

With a lots of jokes and intresting history you feel that you get to know Buenos Aires much deeper. You get the best ideal from Thomas where to go and explore the city yourself as well. He takes you to really good cafesand restaurants that sometimes only the local people find, always ready to answer all your wierd questions about everything and anything in the country! Book a tour with Thomas, you wont regret it! /\"Ilina\""

He tailors the tour to your interests. After a brief stop over coffee and ice cream, he determines (very accurately) your interests and desired pace. Since we were spending two days with him, some of the stops from the city tour were deferred until the second day to give us time to explore further. If you want to do something beyond his standard two tours, let him know in advance and he will be prepared to do what you want to do - not what he wants to do. He does not expect you to pay his way at lunch; rather he will split the tab with you. I would most highly recommend traveling with him with Tomas and look forward to seeing him again."

He is very good with the history of Argentina, he provided full informations about every place we visited, like a teacher, and all of these in a pleasant and funny way.

He obviously has an extensive network at the vast majority of tourist attractions because he was able to make calls on the spot and get us or help us change reservations or extend closing times to ensure we could make an attraction, He provided good and solid guidance on a wide range of topics like exchanging money, on which restaurants to visit, on the food to try, and how to tour sites on your own. In summary, he is gem and is still growing as a tour guide thinking how to make future tours more interesting, more factual, and more cohesive. You won't go wrong hiring Bonaventura."

Tomas served as our key to quickly learning the cities districts & rich/complex history. It was quickly apparent that he was both a polished conversationalist and well-versed historian. His excellent recounting of BA's/Argentina's rich diverse..and often tragic history added immeasurably to our enjoyment and appreciation of what we were doing and seeing. His intuitive sensing of what we wanted to see/do was especially appreciated. While the tour was initially structured to do/see a certain itinerary, he was fully adaptable to modest revisions and tailored the outing to our interests..this is the hallmark of real gem tour guide. A somewhat 'shot in the dark' (as all tour selections are) turned out to be a bulleye and made our BA sojourn a marvelous excursion. Thanks again, mi amigo."

I would suggest to stop into San Isidro, as it\u2019s a gorgeous town on the way to Tigre. The boat portion through the delta area was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!! He gave us some history as we went through areas of it and it amazes me how beautiful it was. We then stopped at the opening of the Tigre, where he dropped the anchor and we had sandwiches and a Quilmes (we drank the beer and he had water and Pepsi :-) When we were done we went to lunch at a spot in Tigre with a nice view of the water. From there, we went on to Peru Beach, which was a very nice spot with locals only. We had desert and coffee and he gave us a very detailed history lesson on Argentina and Buenos Aires. From there, we went to an amazing photo location for a nice photo of BA from a distance. On the way back to the hotel, he continued to talk about himself and Argentina. That night, my wife and I were very happy, and we credit that to Tom\u00e1s!!!

Tomas' toured just the two of us around Buenos Aires based on our interests and answered all of our questions. He also adjusted the tour on a dime based on our input.Second, Tomas was very prompt when he picked us up. Yet, he extended the tour based on our interests. Basically, his timing is impeccable. He takes traffic and weather into consideration when making decisions, as well as the need to stop for food. He is definitely flexible and adaptable.Third, Tomas is both intelligent and uniquely aware of local, national and world politics. He provides context for historical and architectural tours if you are interested in learning about such things. Both of us were very interested. Tomas even took time to draw us a diagram examining the unique political history of Buenos Aires. All of this was entertaining and fun at the same time.Fourth, Tomas will ensure that you are safe on your tour. He is an excellent driver and will make you aware of any issues that you need to take into consideration.Fifth, Tomas is a very personable and interesting family man. He will answer any question openly and honestly while also sharing his personal perspective. He knows the ins and outs of everything about the city. Ask away, your questions will be answered.Sixth, Tomas is an excellent photographer. He will ensure that you look great in all of the photos that he helps you take.Seventh, Tomas knows food if you are into eating, he knows where to go. While you are there, he can describe the unique characteristics of the people living in the neighborhood that you are visiting.Eighth, Tomas is a generous tour guide. He got candy for us:)Ninth, Tomas was born and bread in Buenos Aires. He even attended law school at a university in the city.Tenth and last, you will have a great time!"

It was like touring with a really smart and funny older brother who loves his country. Each day was tailored to my interests. From breakfasts to a picnic lunch on his boat on the Delta (Tigre), I fully enjoyed the culture of Buenos Aires in a unique way. Tomas is an experienced professional, conscientious, intelligent, and has a strong knowledge of B.A. history. The first day, we toured Recoleta Cemetary and its beautiful Cathedral, Plaza de Mayo, and the regal Metropolitan Cathedral. The day began at La Biela, a lovely cafe with a strong, early 20th century Argentinian vibe. Over croissant and cafe, Tomas gave a Cliff's Note version of Argentinian history which informed every sight we visited from then on. The 2nd day, we toured Peru Beach (spectacular views of the BA skyline) and La Boca where we had lunch in a quaint little Italian restaurant, and I bought some artwork. The boat tour of the Delta and Tigre area was the third day, and that was amazing. What an insight into the area where so many Portenos relax and leave the city behind. Charming homes all along the calm and relaxing riverways, and a picnic lunch with another incredible view of the BA skyline. I recommend Tomas' Bonaventura Trips to everyone!

Tomas quickly figured out I have a sweet tooth and was anxious to let me try all sorts of candy, pastries the country has to offer. We had a delicious steak lunch at a local restaurant that had a lovely garden as well.Day two we started at a lovely landmark Cafe Tortola with some coffee and pastries. Tomas certainly knows his history but unlike other guides, if you are uninterested in what he has to say, he will quickly change the subject. It is a tour truly centered on your interests. He took us thru many neighborhoods including La Boca, San Telmo and Recoletta. The fun part was stopping for a taste of local empanadas and grilled cheese (provoletta)! Later in our trip we had some of these things in other places but they weren't as good as the places Tomas took us thru. Next time we come to Buenos Aires we will definitely count on a Food tour with Tomas! He is great company and a palate for tasty Argentinian treats!"

If you are looking for a tour where the guide points out every building as you drive through the tourist area, book a tour with someone else. If you want a relaxed tour fine tuned for your interests, book with Bonaventura Trips and Tomas.Tomas is not formal. From the moment you meet him, you feel like you are with a friend. We spent 2 days with him exploring the Delta region and downtown area. Each day began over coffee where we discussed the plan for the day. On the first day, we explored Tigre and the Delta region. Tigre is a beautiful little town that feels like the Spanish coast. After some caf\u00e9 con leche and treats, we went on his private boat through the rivers and streams of the delta. If you want to relax or if you want to experience the non-touristy areas, this is the perfect tour. Do not do it if seeing every tourist site is on your agenda. We spent several hours driving through the waterways or anchored in the Rio San Antonio overlooking downtown Buenos Aires while drinking beer and eating snacks. Highly recommended day if you want to get off the beaten path.The second day again began with coffee in the Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, a regal coffee house from the golden era of Argentina. While now clearly serving more tourists than locals, a visit is worthwhile in order to appreciate what life was like here in the early 20th century. After visiting all of the typical tourist spots (the Pink House, the Cathedral, etc), Tomas took us to La Boca. The tour typically visits La Bombonera, the stadium of La Boca Junior football team. The stadium and museum are critical for any visit to Buenos Aires if one is a sports fan, and I enjoyed the visit. My wife, however, was bored at the stadium, and you should let Tomas know if you are not a sports or football fan. After the stadium, we stopped for lunch in a local caf\u00e9. From the appearance, I was convinced that I would be ill the rest of the trip, but the food was fantastic. I highly recommend the empanadas and grilled cheese. They were the best that we had during our trip to Argentina. La Boca is fantastic, and use the time there to shop if you do not like sports. We then went to La Recoletta ceremony where the passion of Tomas for Argentinian history was apparent.Tomas is a great guide. My family and I have traveled throughout the world, and we have not experienced a guide with so much enthusiasm before. He loves Argentina, and he wants you to love his country."

We started our day with a little caf\u00e9 and then headed to the neighborhood of Boca. We walked and talked about the area, history, landmarks, and visited Boca Juniors Stadium. He and I bought some Argentinian Futbol gear for the World Cup Final game the next day. Aside from the great tour, he gave great restaurant recommendations (also a great recommendation of where to watch the World Cup Final). After Boca, we went to other great parts of the City, including Recoleta Cemetery, which is amazing!! What makes this tour really great is that it's just like having a friend take you around the city. He gives a great history lesson throughout the tour, which all comes together in the Cemetery when you get to see the tombs of all the different people he mentioned. After enjoying our city tour so much, we were going to do the Delta tour a couple days later, but we just didn't have the time. Thanks again Tomas, we'll be calling you for our next trip!!

All this makes a unique and special experience out of a regular day at the delta.

Later on we got to a really nice quiet part of the delta where he surprised us with some snacks and drinks. We had our own little picnic on the boat! After a while eating and talking we decided to go back. Tom\u00e1s showed us the Navy Museum which, by the way, is awesome, and around the river-side streets that are simply beautiful.All in all, one of the best tours I've ever taken!"

Being quite possibly the only time in our lives when we might be in Argentina, we booked Tomas for 3 days of private touring. We based using Tomas primarily on the great comments on Tripadvisor and his pre-trip correspondence offering options, taking the time to understand what we were wanting out of a tour and his assistance in planning out the days before our arrival. After meeting Tomas we spent a day touring the city, a day in the \"province\" of San Antonio del Arco and finally a day on the Tigre Delta. We had a great time every day and would not have changed anything. As many people have said, it was like having a knowledge friend showing you the sights. I won't repeat all of the details well covered in the numerous other reviews. It was a great combination of tourist must see sights and local not so tourist sights. He also took the time to offer recommendations and directions for wandering Buenos Aires on our own during our \"off\" days. I would give him 6 stars.We now hope to visit Argentina again and would certainly use Tomas again for some new adventures."

After some investigation, we decided a trip to the Tigre Delta was just the ticket and started searching for a guide to take us there. We pretty quickly ruled out the larger group tours. Being packed on a bus just to be packed onto a boat has about zero appeal to us, so we started looking at guides who did private tours. After reading through the review, Tom\u00e1s seemed to fit the profile. A quick email, and he had confirmed us for a day trip, picking us up and dropping us off at our hotel in Palermo Soho. We could not have been happier with our choice. Tom\u00e1s feels more like a friend of a friend rather than a tour guide. He is very laid back, friendly and has a great sense of humor. His English is excellent and his insights into local culture are excellent. He doesn't sound like someone who has given the same tour 100 times. Rather, the experience with him feels like he is taking his friends in his boat to show off the area.He took us through some of the smaller areas of the Delta, not just focusing on the big sites and the rowing clubs. We had a chance to see the grocery boats out delivering to the locals. For lunch, he took us to Villa Julia for an excellent, and very reasonably-priced lunch. We sat out in the lawn under a canopy and enjoyed chatting about the history of the country, something Tom\u00e1s has a passion for.After the Tigre, we went to Peru Beach to sit out and watch the sunset while having a beer. Overall a fantastic day with a wonderful guide. I would highly recommend Tom\u00e1s to anyone looking for a fun day around BA. Well worth the very modest fee."

I could not think of a better way to see and experience Buenos Aires than a tour with Tomas.First off, Tomas was punctual and really catered the tour for what my husband and I wanted to see. He was personable..and really just fun to be around! What sets this tour different than the rest is a number of things. First, the tour is individualized to what your needs are and what you want to see. Secondly, you get personal attention and every question answered. I didn't feel like I was just another tourist but hanging out with a local, someone who answered all our questions and who really let us in on the cultural aspects of being an Argentinean.We did two tour day with Tomas. The first day we explored BA. We went to the \"Pink House\" where crazily we got to get in to the President's office and actually see the desk she worked at! We also got to explore the famous cemetery of Recoleta. Tomas was great telling us the important history and stories of each site...he is so knowledgeable! He knew every answer to our questions...and really focuses on the history and culture of the events. At the end of the tour, Tomas was so sweet he actually stayed around our hotel while we got ready and dropped us off at a dinner spot he recommended (which we thought was likely the best steak we've ever had). We were so grateful Tomas took time out of his day to do this.Our second tour was of the Delta...which was a special way to see the outskirts of BA. Tomas took us around in his boat, and we got to have a very enjoyable lunch in one of the restaurants on the delta. Such pretty sights...He actually even showed us his own home on the delta..it was wonderful to interact with his family and truly feel like a local.Basically Tomas went above and beyond for us and really made our stay in BA. We recommend him whole heartedly...if your looking for a personable, fun, local friend with incredible knowledge of history and culture then Tomas is the guide for you! Thanks Tomas!"

The first day we toured the Tigre River Delta on his boat and lunched at a rowing club. The tour provided us with first-hand knowledge of how the people on the river live using only boat transportation as there are no roads. We passed supermarket boats and were told that boats were used as school buses for local children. From the boat we had a view of Buenos Aires as we looked southward. We ate lunch at a rowing club in Tigre before returning to the city and I had divine cannelloni. It was a lovely boat, and Tomas is an excellent driver. I highly recommend this tour if you would like to see the countryside outside the city. The next three days Tomas took us to see all of the sights of the city as well as entertaining my husband at a cafe while I did some shopping. His English is excellent, and he is very knowledgeable about the city and about Argentina history. His tour of Recolleta Cemetery is especially enlightening.  Tomas showed us Carminito Street and guided us to a cafe known to locals. He also took us to Don Julio Restaurant for a real Argentina steak (the best meal we had in Argentina).  I had done a great deal of research before our trip, and I shared my list of things we wanted to see and do with Tomas. He was very enthusiastic about showing us all the sights that we requested, and he made each day both educational and fun.  He took us to the Belle Artes Museum and knew much about the art there. I requested a visit to a Milonga, and he was eager to show it to us. We had attended a River Plate \"futbol\" game, but we wanted to see Bombanera Stadium and Museum where Boca Juniors play. He knew all about the exhibits in the museum, and he really made the experience a powerful one. We have had many guides on other trips, but Tomas became more than just a guide for us. He became more like a son or friend. We will definitely stay in touch with him. He gets my highest recommendation.

(Evita used to speak to the people from here ). Our tour also included a visit to LA RECOLETA , the little Paris of South America and one of the most important districts. Here we visited the unique and famous cemetery.This is where Evita is buried As you can see this was a very thorough tour.Tomas ensured we achieved our objectives and his friendly pleasing attitude made it a very enjoyable. This was a memorable and fun tour experience. I would highly recommend Thomas"

However he was only ten minutes late having, unbeknown to us, sent an email with apologies. We were soon on our way in his car and as the weather looked a bit doubtful he asked if we would prefer to go for the river tour on a larger, covered boat. Fortunately we decide against this and went to a boatyard to pick up his father's motor boat. The weather changed for the better and we thoroughly enjoyed going along some of the narrow creeks which would not have been possible in a larger boat. The scenery was amazing with lovely views of the houses and gardens along the river banks. After an hour or so we anchored in the middle of the channel and enjoyed a welcome glass of beer before returning to Tigre for lunch. this we had in a very nice restaurant beside the river and afterwards had a tour of the Naval Museum which was nearby. Here Tomas was able to show his extensive knowledge of the items on display and all to soon it was time to return to the city. The whole experience lasted for over seven hoursd and we consider it excellent value for money."

He is a funny guy, who achieved a great balance between informative tour guide and fun-to-know local. The boat ride around Tigre is relaxing and beautiful. It really feels like a world away from the hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires. A visit to the navy museum proved to be very interesting, thanks to Tom\u00e1s. We got a peek into Argentinean history and a few anecdotal stories along the way.The day concluded with a great lunch. Overall, I highly endorse this company!"

He picked us up in his car from our hotel in the morning, happily drove us all around town, and after a fun filled day of exploring he dropped us back off at our hotel.For a personal tour\u2014Tomas\u2019 fee is INCREDIBLY reasonable and I would highly recommend that anyone visiting BA drop Tomas an email in advance of arriving to schedule a tour with him on one of your first days there."

His prices are reasonable in comparison to the other tour guides. Surprisingly we found BA to be very expensive. If you are on a budget or have a large family (private tour prices in BA are based on the number of people not per family like in Europe) do not hesitate to contact Thomas. Our favourite tour was of Recoleta cemetery where Thomas has shown a vast knowledge of the BA history. The delta of Tigre was nice and relaxing. The Gaucho experience was OK. There was not much to do but if you are looking for a relaxing day on the farm with really good food you will definitely enjoy this get away. Host family at the estancia is very nice and hospitable. They went above and beyond to make us feel at home."

We have a group of 6 people and had not planned anything except for We are Tango which we very much look forward to. So I tried my lucky to contact Tomas by email after seeing such raving reviews from other reviewers. Tomas replied my email first thing the next morning with a suggestion of what he proposes to do with us. I saw the email just when we landed in BA. I jumped to the opportunity and we agreed to meet at our apartment 2 hours after we checked in. Since we have granny of 85 yo traveling with us walking tour is out of the question. Tomas arranged a minvan and there we go. He is such a jolly and enthusiastic guide. We had a great trip seeing a number of famous tourist spots in the city (football club, a local tourist spot where most houses are built on old ship wrecks, then St Martin's Church where Pope Francis used to be celebrating mass, the pink government house, and of course the Rocoleta Cemetery where Evita Peron was buried). It was supposed to be a rest day for Tomas but he agreed to spend the afternoon with us and made an excellent first impression of this important world city to us. Tomas is an excellent amateur singer and he sang us a song before we end our fun, entertaining and memorable city tour. We can't thank him enough."

In this very large city we were able to see all the key neighborhoods. Tomas is friendly, knowledgable, and speaks very good English. Also, he is very flexible; if you express special interest in a particular site (the Football Stadium, for instance) he will take you there. Sinc\u00e9 he has been a student of history he had much to tell about the origins and development of modern day Argentina. Especially impressive was our visit to the Recolete Cemeterio where his recitation of history interwoven with the visible evidence--literally shrines-- of many of the former leaders of the country, combined to make a fascinating visit. On a second full day tour we asked Tomas to drive us to Tigre and again we weren\u00b4t disappointed. He knew the town (and canals) intimately as his family has a \"country\" home there.It is a \"must see\" destination: beautiful and unique. All in all we can recommend Bonaventura Private Tours without reservation. In the person of Tomas we know you\u00b4re going to enjoy the attributes of a knowledgeable and personable private guide as you experience the wonders of Buenos Aires and Tigre."

The tour was $30 USD per person and you can reserve a spot and pay on their website. The tour includes some walking, and some transport by private small bus. The tour is three hours, but we would not recommend making plans directly afterward, as you end the tour at a bar owned by local artists, which is a great place to browse art pieces for purchase and/or get a drink in a cool bar covered with art. Weird tip, but watch where you step in some of the areas where the tour goes. The area has a good amount of dog feces on its sidewalks.The tour guides at Graffiti Mundo are all passionate about the street art in Buenos Aires and the information shared helps visitors to better understand the social, economic and political history of the city. It's also a great way to meet fellow travelers. We would recommend this tour to anyone who has an interest in street art or learning about Buenos Aires from a different perspective. Additionally, if you enjoyed the tour and happen to travel to S\u00e3o Paulo, we would highly recommend the free tour of Vila Madalena, which also highlights amazing street art.

It's also a great opportunity to explore an area (the depths of Barracas) that is not a popular tourist destination"

We did the Southern Tour, and next time we go back we will do the Northern Tour around Palermo. I had never been to Barracas, one of the neighbourhoods in the tour and it was very interesting to see another side to touristy Buenos Aires. We had trouble booking online, but when I called the group they were very friendly/helpful and our guide Anna, was warm and enthusiastic.

Our tour guide, Anna, provided a comprehensive overview of the artistic techniques and social history surrounding the graffiti.

It covered everything from top artists graffiti who'd been commissioned to the scribblings of licals and what they might mean. She also explained how differently graffiti is viewed here, ie. not a crime that has to be done wearing a hoodie in the dead of night, its accepted as an art form and a way to communicate/express or to just want to inject some colour and fun into lives during darker times. It really was enlightening, I learnt much and now notice graffiti everywhere in the city. Do it!"

Highly recommend this tour if you have any interest in street art. We'll definitely do the North City Tour on our next visit."

Anna was an excellent guide. Not only did we see some amazing art and graffitti, we learned much about the history of Buenos Aires, the importance of LaBocca, Quinquela Martin and much much more. First class coach ride for alot of it but you can get out to take pics. Don't miss this tour!"

We learnt heaps about street art, saw some very cool paintings and Graffiti and spent a pleasant 3 hours in a new part of BA. Anna our guide was great, answered our questions and enthusiastically explained what we were seeing in the tour. Using a mini van meant we got to see allot more than just walking and the brief trip through the Flea market was an added bonus."

Anna explained some of the stories behind what was going on on the wall, and all of a sudden I started seeing things in graffiti that I had never noticed before."

My boyfriend and I are usually not very keen on guided tours but since I like street art a lot and wanted to get to know the context of the street art pieces that one can encounter at every corner of Buenos Aires we booked the south tour. Our guide Ana did a fantastic job and served as facts around the street art pieces in La Boca and Barracas that she took us too as well as personal stories on the recent and current political developments. The places we went to are marked as unsafe for tourists by the lonely planet which made it even more interesting and exciting to be able to see them. Ana is a very open and easy-going person. She encouraged us to ask any question even if they tangiated her personal life and didn't hesitate to elaborate on the Mystics of Porte\u00f1os. So, if you want to learn bout street art, history, politics and the way of life in Buenos Aires, this is the perfect way. If we had been in Buenos Aires on a Sunday we certainly had booked the bicycle tour though."

Anne was our tour guide and was an eloquent speaker and her passion and knowledge made this for an exceptional experience. It last for 3 hours and the first 30 minutes or so is filled with a lot of facts and background information that may seem like too much at first but as the tour continues you realize that all that background information made the tour that much more meaningful and enjoyable.

BA can be a bit overwhelming to experience as a tourist, because you don't know where to begin, but this is a great starting point! I like the morning north city tour with Ana, and then you can use the afternoon to explore Palermo."

There were more people than I expected (about 16) but it didn't feel at all crowded - everyone had plenty of chances to view art, take pics and hear Ana speak. So much history and info was covered and the spots chosen were all interesting & unique. It was pouring rain the day I went but it didn't matter - we had a great time anyways. Loved both galleries and found a few new favourite artists too. If you do this, be generous with your tips as it's extremely good value and proceeds support graffitimundo which is not for profit.

Generally I find that if 99 out of 100 people say that something is excellent, then it must be true. I've found this to be true with respect to reviews via Trip Advisor. We are traveling with our 6 month old daughter and we had some concern whether or not the tour would be able to us as we would need to occupy a spot on the bus for her car seat. Ana made us feel more than totally welcome. All that being said, the tour involved getting on and off the bus. Every time we re-boarded the bus, we would have to strap in our daughter. At one point, she fell asleep in her seat. When that happened we weren't about to wake her up when the bus stopped and everyone de-boarded. As a result, my wife had to miss a segment as she stayed with our daughter on the bus. I mention this for those that are traveling with an infant, so that they can keep this aspect in mind.Also, I thought I should mention that we took a taxi from Palermo Soho to the meeting point in La Boca. The taxi ride took almost a half hour and cost 150 pesos, so keep that in mind when budgeting one's time and money."

We spent a lot of time talking about Graffitimundo, the artists they work with, and the history of graffiti in Buenos Aires. We also spent a decent amount of time on the mini-bus getting from one place to another. And when we got to each place, there was usually only one street art piece to photograph. I don't think it was the best use of 3 hours. I got more photos walking around on my own."

The guide, Ana, was so knowledgeable, comical and relaxed despite some of the wanderers in the group. Most of the stops along the North City tour are on the sidewalks of Colegiales and Palermo so stay alert to traffic. Tons of information about local artists that have transformed the traditional concept of street art and graffiti, learned about the different styles used and how this is a way for everyone to have access to art not just for those who can afford it. My favorite was visiting Hollywood in Cambodia (Palermo) which was a super montage of art all over the walls and terrace. This is a safe haven for active graffiti/street artists to share their work with the public in a trendy bar. Over all it was a great experience well worth the price!"

Street art in Buenos Aires is everywhere, but out fantastic guide gave us an amazing insight into the history behind graffiti in Buenos Aires, showed us works by different artists around the city and explained and the themes they are expressing and their influences. With the two guides helping us negotiate the Buenos Aires streets I always felt very safe. I also got to try mate tea for the first time and they explained the rituals behind this argentinan practice. Fastastic tour!"

We had two guides- a biking guy (works with Biking Buenos Aires) and a graffiti guide (works with GraffitiMundo). It was fun and easy to bike around-- the bike guy stays with the bikes and has tools in case anyone has bike issues, we often used bike lanes, and Sunday was a pretty quiet day on the streets. They're basically cruiser bikes, nothing fancy but easy to use. The tour itself was definitely in-depth. Our guide (Circa) very much knew her stuff. She explained the historical context and political significance of graffiti in Buenos Aires, named and detailed the viewpoints and motifs of various street artists, brought us to places where they work, and was very open to questions and suggestions. The art is incredible and neighborhoods were cool. Definitely recommended for a Sunday afternoon exploration in the city!"

The majority of the tour is spent on a bus, with stops at which you can get out to see the art up close and take pictures. FYI - there is no eating on the bus."

This tour, led by Ana, provided us with excellent insight into the genesis and evolution of the street art of Buenos Aires and how it reflects the sometimes turbulent history of freedom of expression and artistic and community comment on the times. We were challenged to really look into the art and work to understand it before Ana peeled away the many layers to the different works and contextualised them to their location and the communities in those locations. While I don't think it rules out anyone interested in street art, I really valued having a guide who was able to discuss the techniques and the cultural context of the works we viewed. We saw many pieces in hidden away locations - sometimes only through the windows of our comfortable bus just to be on the safe side. The stories of how these works grew out of communities rather than being imposed on them was fascinating. I highly recommend this tour, Ana as a guide and the driver and our fixer. Thanks for a great day in San Telmo, La Boca and surrounds. A memorable day well worth the cost."

Bicycling in BA is not as bad as it sounds if you go on a Sunday. Still, not for the faint of heart.A big bonus is the stop at the pub with the street art.

They do not include transportation to and from the tours back to your hotel, but for the price it still seems like a good deal.

Not only were the street murals and different types of street art we saw amazing, but we learned so many interesting things about the medium which just wouldn't be apparent if you were walking around on your own looking at the art. We saw some really beautiful murals and passed by many more that we just didn't have time to stop at. The tour is $25 and more than worth the money. Around 1 hour is spent walking and the rest of the time you are in an air-conditioned bus. I would recommend for everyone visiting the city whether you are into street art or not."

We started our 3 month travel in BA, where the North Tour was the undoubted highlight of our trip. After 3 months we returned to do the South Tour and it didn't disappoint once more. Our guide in both tours was Ana, a journalist from BA who is obviously knee deep into the BA streetart movement. Her enthousiasm and knowledge of (the origin of) BA street art is downright awesome. The origin and meaning of street art in Argentina is explained really well, giving you the appropriate context for the amazing murals that you will see in the tour.In short Graffitimundo is one of the coolest things to do in BA. And if you have to choose to spend your money on (for instance) Teatro Colon or Graffitimundo, I would easily choose the latter.Btw: If you really have to choose between the North and the South tour: I would go for the North tour as you see more different murals of different artists than in the South Tour, which is more about (very) large murals. But if you've got the time: do them both!"

Bar being all of the good things; nice, caring, upbeat and great company and a guide, she did the most important thing. She connected the soul of the artists, the medium and their hearts. Its why I love the medium and is so rare to here another speak with the clarity and depth, and to hear the history was amazing. I would highly recommend Graffitimundo and this and their tours for anyone! I can't wait to see your documentary also, and think what you are doing is amazing! x"

Sophia did our tour and she was very knowledgeable and passionate about street art's role in BA history. It was amazing! Plus, the tour was only $25, lasted 3 hours, and a bus was used to get around for a bit of it. Well worth the value! Before the tour, I was commenting on the amount of graffiti in the city and what a shame it was to deface buildings, but now I know that it is an acceptable and innovative art movement. Very cool!"

On our recent visit to Buenos Aires we initially were initially put off by the graffiti that seemed to deface some of the stunning buildings in Palermo, where we were staying. I asked our helpful Buenos Aires concierge, Mariela, about it. She explained that the history of graffiti and street art in Buenos Aires has political roots, is very interesting, and suggested that we take the Graffitimundo tour to better understand it... I have no background in graffiti and street art, but started to pay attention. When in B.A. you wil see really stunning, vivid modern art on many walls and buildings. The Graffitimundo tour really put it all into perspective for me.Our guide, I believe her name is Ana, was fantastic. And for only $25 this tour is an amazing deal, as you spend 3 hours touring popular areas of town and learning about graffiti, street art and propoganda street art. Ana was enthusiastic, thoughtful, committed, and well versed in international grafitti and street art. Being over 60, i was clueless who Banksy was, the famous British graffiti artist, until this tour. Now I'm very interested and found myself walking the barrios of B.A. looking for interesting street art to capture and photograph. There are really some spectacular street art scenes around the city, many of which have a political message to tell. Some are just whimsical and fun.We opted to focus on the street art rather than spend a lot of time inside art museums. Like hip hop, it seems that street art is now becoming more mainstream. At least many artists are putting their energy into vivid art on the streets, so everyone can enjoy it. We learned that it is not unusual for a graffiti artist to be inspired and go to art school and then go back to the streets as a more polished artist. And the art on the streets belongs to the people. That is the bottom line in Argentina and why it is so popular. The way it was explained in this tour is that although graffiti is \"illegal\" in Buenos Aires, it is \"tolerated\". Street artists actually sign their art, and leave contact info because it is so accepted and appreciated by the locals. A graffiti artist will not paint over street art. So many building owners actually contact a favorite street artist and invite them to use their creative talents to paint a scene on their building, over the grafitti. After this tour I found the graffiti and street art to be more enjoyable and acceptable. We North Americans often apply our \"standards\" when visiting other countries. Sometimes they just don't fit. This was a real lesson for me about how our cultural differences can creep in when we don't even realize it."

So, I had lived in Buenos Aires for about 4 months..but sadly enough during those 4 months I saw very little of the city because I was either working or broke. It never set well with me..so this past February (2015) I decided to return for a month to get to know the city a little better. Well I booked the Sunday graffiti bike tour and boy did I love it. I'm really into street art, I think it captures a lot of the culture a city has to offer, but this tour goes above and beyond. Our guide Sorcha was so knowledgable about the history of street art in BAires....and about the artists that contribute to that culture as well as their styles. It was so fascinating and as a bonus we got to get to the city and the barrios on bici which I LOVED!!! It's seriously a must do tour!!! The bici tour is only offered on Sundays so book in advance if possible but if not i'm sure the tour by foot is just as great. I didn't get to meet any of the other guides but Sorcha was phenomenal and our bike tech guy Sean was also brilliant!! He gave quite the 'know all' on mate culture !! So much so i'm drinking a mate right now thanks to his lesson on how to prepare it. =) Thanks Sean!!! And Thank you Sorcha!! You guys and the tour rock!!!"

Very knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the history, politics and practicalities of art in public places. The $25 (USD) was excellent value for money which benefits the artists and helps to spread the culture and messages of street art in buenos aires.The tour lasted approx 3 hours and the majority of the time we were on foot, walking short distances through the northern district. Ana gave a brief history of the origins of street art from political propaganda, teenage tagging and stencilling to the current wave of graphic designers and illustrators making their mark on the walls of Latin america. We stopped in front of several impressive pieces and were given contextual information about the artists and their intentions. The variety of street art was broad and varied and included several works by female artists and international collaborations. The styles and techniques were interesting and at times breathtaking, making for some memorable photo opportunities and leaving you with a desire to find out more about the artists and explore this unique art form.The tour ended at a bar and gallery in Palermo which hosts work from the artists seen on the tour and there is an opportunity to purchase some highly original work. We were told that there is a film currently being made about this movement, and the cost of the tour contributes to this and other publications surrounding graffitimundo. I look forward to seeing how this scene develops and am grateful to have been able to contribute to it in some small way."

I came away with a better understanding of the area, a revitalised appreciation of street art and a big smile. I cannot recommend this tour highly enough - do it!!!"

This is such a unique and intimate way to explore the vibrant city of Buenos Aires. A city overflowing with creative energy, that is also inseparable from it's tumultuous past. The tour reflects on the voice of street art and graffiti and is equal parts visually stimulating and historically informative. The guide Ana was passionate, enthusiastic, and incredibly knowledgable. Hands down, this tour is amazing. If you are an art or history lover, do yourself a favor and go!"

It was very interesting hearing about the origins of graffiti and street-art in Buenos Aires. I'm really glad I took the tour, because we walked by so many pieces that I wouldn't really have noticed or understood otherwise. One regret would be the use of the minibus. It was very welcome on the day we took the tour, as it was raining heavily from time to time, but the distances would have easily been done walking."

You meet on a street corner with the guide and other visitors and then walk around a well planned route to see some excellent street art that is not only visually stunning but also explains the social history of street art and freedom of expression in the country. For the time investment of a few afternoon hours it was so worth it and we're glad we did it on our first day there as it helped to show us around an area, and we could pick the guide's brains as to what to do during our time there too. You get ferried around in a minibus from some places (which has A/C too!) and both the driver and guide were really friendly and passionate about their topic.Really happy we found out about it and would definitely recommend it, even if you are (yet!) to be convinced about street art!"

She had a great sense of humor (as Irish people do!) and answered any queries the group had. I won't spoil the tour by telling you everything but we saw some really beautiful pieces and discovered the meanings and feelings behind them. The company sounds like an excellently run company who work with the artists and contribute to their livelihood. They are in the midst of a book and documentary production about the scene in Buenos Aires which accentuates the feeling that they are truly passionate about the tours they provide! Maybe a little expensive but I suppose Buenos Aires tends to be a little bit pricier than its more easterly neighbors."

I just wish we could have brought some of the art work back home with us. We were prepared to buy--the tour ends at a gallery--but there was no easy way to pack canvases and our visit was at the tail end of an exhibit so there weren't many prints (which can be rolled up and easier to pack) left. Graffitimundo should find a partner gallery in NYC or another big US city--the street art is amazing!"

I really enjoy seeing street art around the world and find these kind of tours to be a great way to get a taste of parts of the city where normal people live (instead of just seeing the touristy areas) and hear a little about the political history of the country. The guide was great and the coordination with the mini bus was well done so we didn't waste time walking between the main areas of art."

Our tour guide, Kirsty, was a wealth of knowledge and excited about sharing the city and art with us. We learned about the history, the neighborhoods, the various artists, meanings behind their work, and different types of graffiti. And, if you like to view this type of art and take photos, you will be in heaven!The tour is kept to a small group and is primarily conducted on foot within a Palermo neighborhood. The tour is accompanied by a van which transports you to various points within the tour. It concludes in a bar showcasing art with artists on site. It is roughly three hours unless you want to linger longer in the bar.It was one of my favorite afternoons in the city and I will definitely explore this tour again on another visit. Price and experience cannot be beat!"

The guide was very knowledgeable about not only street art (how things were made, how the community works, etc) but also the history of Buenos Aires, how street art in the city came about. Granted that I was too busy taking photos, the introduction was insightful and the guide was very friendly (she's from Ireland) and clearly knows what she's talking about. I would highly recommend this."

Some of the areas to which she took us, there's no way we would have found that on our own. And she was great about explaining some of the social and political history that put a lot of this art in context.We went on this tour near the end of our stay in BA, but if you can, I'd recommend booking for earlier. She put the city in to context for us, and gave us a ton of useful information that we would have taken advantage of if we'd have had a few more days. They say this on their website, but it's really true. I'm absolutely glad we went, I just wish we'd gone earlier. And remember not to drink too much coffee or mate before the tour; it's a walking / minibus tour, your bathroom opportunities are limited!"

We worked with the artist Federico, formally known as 'run don't walk', and our workshop was awesome. It lasted four hours, and despite arriving a little late he worked with us for our complete allocated time. Within this workshop, you are given a real understanding of graffiti art, create your own stencil and then experiment with it! We loved our workshop, and definitely plan to continue our graffiti skills. Would highly recommend it to others!"

The tour combined bus and walking transport. I thought that the guide really dragged out the explanations and it was quite tedious at several points. She spent a lengthy amount of time at one piece giving us very long explanations about political history (normally I would find this riveting) but I was bored silly. At the end of the tour she bought us to a graffiti bar and introduced us to a graffiti artist who literally said 'hi' then left! She gave no explanation other than pointing to a few of his pieces, like she did not explain why he became a graffiti artist, how long he had been doing it for - nothing. Even if the artist couldn't speak English you would think she might let us ask a few questions or maybe he could say a quick introduction. I was just really disappointed. I do acknowledge the other great reviews that are here."

She managed to teach us all about what graffiti is, where it came from, who uses it every day (hint: for their political aims), and how to think about this media as art.Until I took this tour, my idea of seeing art was to visit as many museums and galleries as possible. This is what I do when I travel; luckily I have a wonderful girlfriend who does the same. Now that I understand that graffiti artists live in a world that has nothing to do with vandalizing buildings, walls, etc. I realize that every street is a museum. Having grown up in the Big Apple, this literally blows my mind!On this tour you will learn the difference between mere tagging, bombing, stenciling and street art. And you will see things you've seen every day, but with a brand new perspective.I should also mention that Ana speaks exceptional English, and has a solid grasp of the terminology artists and fans like us use. That, in itself, is a treat.As you can tell, I can't recommend this tour enough. Go on it, and enjoy the beautiful world of street art that Buenos Aires has to offer.(And don't skip the museums, like MALBA, MACBA, Bellas Artes, Fortabat, etc. either.)"

So when my mom and her boyfriend told me they were coming to visit, I remembered having heard about Graffitimundo, and thought the tour might be a fun, different experience for them. I skimmed the TripAdvisor reviews and decided we should go for it. What a GREAT decision. I can honestly say that of all the tours I've done in Buenos Aires, this is the one I'd most highly recommend. Ana, our guide, started with an informative overview of the history and origins of graffiti/street art in Buenos Aires, layering in some perspective about the socioeconomic/political history (in perfect English), and proceeded to lead us on an adventure through parts of BA that most tourists never see. The street art itself was interesting, thought- and conversation-provoking, and some of it quite beautiful. In the aftermath of the tour, I walk the streets and look out the bus window with an entirely new perspective. This is a tour that turned \"my\" city into a museum. Truly excellent."

I hope the analogy's not too weird, but this tour was a bit like that! Let me explain -- I'm a doctoral student who has been traveling to Argentina periodically for about 5 years now for fieldwork. I have a reputation for being a total bore/nerd whenever Argentina comes up in conversation with my family and friends back home, rattling off historical and political facts that most people probably don't care about. My mom recently came to visit me in Buenos Aires, and she learned SO MUCH from this tour! All the political, social, historical stuff that I'd probably force upon her was made much more accessible in our guide's explanation of the street art we saw on our tour (broccoli in the sauce...). Super interesting presentation of the social history of the city! My mom and I both learned a lot, and came away from the tour with a new appreciation for street art. We were even able to recognize artists' work when we came across it later on in the city.Awesome tour, regardless of your interest in/knowledge of Argentine history, politics, art, etc. This is a great way to learn about the city without the cliche anecdotes and cheesy jokes you'd usually come across in a guided tour.

Three of us went on a private 3 hour tour with Ana going to different barrios and seeing the wonderful variety of street murals, learning about the artists and what they wanted to say or not say. This was a great way to see less touristy parts of city. The street art was colorful and fanciful and always provoked discussion among us. A different and rewarding experience. Glad we did it."

She gave us insights that we never would have gotten as average American tourists (although we had another terrific \"regular\" guide for other areas in BA). After our tour with Cecilia, who did exactly what some of the other reviewers have reported, we began to see BA through much richer, more exciting lenses!! What a gift!! This is WELL-Worth your time. In addition, Cecilia sent us a list of \"things we like\", including their favorite galleries, shops, restaurants, cafes and other tours!! This is a \"gold mine\" for travelers to BA!!!"

Once we were on the ground and connected I checked out the reviews here and decided it was a \"must-do\" for me and my girlfriend. What a cool tour! I think that we stayed in Palermo but hit a number of the sub-neighborhoods. The art is just incredible... Our tour guide, Melissa, was absolutely perfect. Not only is she super-knowledgeable about the street art and artists, she is genuinely enthusiastic about it. I highly recommend the tour! Be sure to bring water with you and wear comfortable shoes. This is such a different and fun activity!If you are coming to the tour from a different part of the city, plan to spend some time walking around the gallery after the tour ends."

And, foolishly, I thought we could research the art, hail a cab and discover what we liked on our own. After doing a little of that on Sunday morning in Barracas, we were hooked and wanted to see and understand more about these walls of art. We called Graffitimundo Sunday night and by 9:30 the next morning Cecilia and a driver were there to give us a tour before we caught our plane back to Vancouver. Her enthusiasm, intelligence and inside knowledge of the evolution-after-the revolution of this art form and its creators made the tour the highlight of our trip. I recommend visiting Graffitimundo\u2019s website in advance and plan to return to it frequently to keep up with the endeavours of this bright young company. Lucky Argentinians: tours are free for you on Sundays."

But this tour has changed the way I look at graffiti/street art and the way I think about artists interacting with a city. I learned for example that a \"tag\" next to a work of art is like a \"Like\" on facebook, it means another artist approves. But a tag over the center of a mural is a dislike. I also love learning the history of street art in Argentina and Buenos Aires and how the culture is much more open there. At the end, at the gallery of local stencil artists, I bought a great piece for my wall at home and a great gift for friends in B.A. Bravo Graffitimundo!"

There was a description and differentiation among graffiti, tagging, and street art in the beginning, and I think that the idea of tagging was a bit glorified and romanticized by the tour guide, who was very young. Most in the group, myself included, felt that tagging is detrimental and inconsiderate, which seemed to cause a little bit of tension, but nothing that couldn't be overcome. The tour was interesting, although perhaps a bit longer than it needed to be. It ended in an artists' gallery/bar, but it was a very low pressure environment where you didn't feel forced to buy anything if you didn't want to. Overall, I'm glad we did the tour."

On the tour you learn about the history of La Boca and its brightly colored buildings, a home of poor immigrants who worked in the docks and shipyards. We first walked to some street art near the museum, and Ceci explained the history of street art and wall painting and the different techniques. It is definitely not just ugly tagging with spray cans, although you see a lot of that also. Wall painting is a political and cultural condition, and may walls are painted with the consent of the owners of the buildings. We then got into a van and looked at street art and colorful exteriors in other parts of the city. Lasts about 3 hours. You will see parts of the city you will otherwise miss and learn a lot about street art and artists."

We started out in La Boca and ended up in a cool, art-filled bar in Palermo Soho. It was definitely worth doing and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone coming here who is interested in art."

I had a hard time choosing between the tour options, but ultimately went with this one since I wanted to see more areas of the city. I was not disappointed. We visited a number of neighborhoods I definitely would not have seen on my own. Our guide, Cecilia, was very friendly, accessible, warm and engaged. In fact, at the end of the tour our group shared drinks and snacks together at the art gallery/pub where the tour ends.I am sure the other tours are just as good, so you won't be disappointed in whichever you choose. I think the Hidden Walls is perhaps more time on the bus, as you cover a big area of the city, and the other one might be more walking, though I am not sure of that. In any case, I learned a lot about art, Buenos Aires history and neighborhoods, and met interesting people!I first contacted the group via email and they were very helpful and responsive in helping me prepare for the trip. I paid on-line beforehand and got a 10% discount."

I was pleased to find out that a few of the stops on my own personal itinerary were part of the tour (post bar and the brilliant hollywood in cambodia gallery). Our tour guide, Melissa, was amazing as well. Her knowledge and passion for the street art scene in Buenos Aires was overflowing and infectious, it was such a pleasure meeting her and having her as our guide. The tour itself was just the right amount of time and a perfect way to spend a nice sunday afternoon, the mate break was also a nice touch. I certainly highly recommend this tour and will likely be taking it again myself with visiting friends!"

The tour guide was dynamic, funny, warm and a great storyteller. She told us all about the history of street art, its trajectory and significance in Buenos Aires, and the stories/meanings behind all of the pieces we saw. Our tour was on a really chilly day, but with the walking and the short stints on the bus between neighborhoods, the three hours flew by. We were lucky enough to visit a studio in Palermo where several street artists work, and the tour ended at Post St. Bar, where we grabbed a drink and enjoyed even more art (indoors) in the funky gallery/bar. The tour was one of the highlights of my time in BA so far. If you like art in general, you'll really like this tour. I'd seen Exit Through the Gift Shop before the tour, so I was really excited. It exceeded my expectations. I learned so much and the group was fun, too! I'm a college student on exchange here, but there were people of all ages on the tour. Definitely do it!"

The other reviews have covered nearly everything, so just a few comments:I took the group tour on Easter weekend, so the city was nice and quiet, but the artists weren\u2019t in their studios. We did get to see one studio shared by several artists, leaf through some books about street art in Buenos Aires, see some sketches and paintings, and visit with the resident cats.Perhaps because it was a holiday weekend, the tour wasn\u2019t full although I emailed only the day before. I was able to pay online using PayPal, which gave me a discount of several dollars and allowed me to keep my pesos to use for other expenses.Ana was a fantastic, knowledgeable guide. After the tour I stayed to buy a print and met another guide, an Aussie whose name I can\u2019t recall, and she was just as affable. On the tour I also met a very friendly Argentine freelance writer who gave me Buenos Aires travel tips, and we traded email and blog addresses.The tour is appropriate for everyone from street art experts to those who know nothing about Argentina beyond Madonna in \u201cEvita.\u201d I\u2019ve been studying (and teaching) Argentine history and culture for more than 2 years, and I consider myself well-versed in contemporary politics and civil society movements there, but I learned a number of things on this tour that I\u2019d never heard before (about the \u201cfootball mafia\u201d and about recently deceased former president N\u00e9stor Kirchner, for example). Ana was also good at addressing larger, more philosophical questions about street art vs. tagging, public art on private property, and the like.The Graffitimundo group is currently filming a documentary, \u201cWhite Walls Say Nothing,\u201d about the city\u2019s street art scene and its history. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing it when it\u2019s completed, and the next time I\u2019m in the city, I\u2019ll take Graffitimundo\u2019s Hidden Walls tour."

We were taken by minibus through the city and our guide Cecilia was very insightful and the tour wa packed with nice stories. Her English was excellent. The only drawback was that the tour was full the day I would have preferred, so book in advance. The highlight was visiting two of the street art-artist's own studios. There's also a possibility to buy some art at the end of the tour. Also, one last thing, you get a really good booklet with tips on other nice places in BA."

Our lovely guide - who also spoke great English - took us to places and streets in Buenos Aires I never would have seen otherwise, and that's not because we were heading into 'sketchy' districts - just because theses places are off the tourist trail! And what a shame... Some of this graffiti is stunning. A real cut above the Banksys and everyone else working back in Europe (or at least I thought so!). Great to see such incredible artwork, and to have stories and information from someone who not only knew the area, but also the artists themselves and their histories. This is more than just graffiti - it's street art, and some of the sheer aesthetics are stunning. The political history behind this work is also fascinating, and something you'd struggle to learn from a guidebook or history of Buenos Aires. The day was fun, informative and a great time - highly recommended!"

I had read the great reviews (including its inclusion in the NY Times' 36 Hours series), but wasn't rushing to take the tour because street art didn't seem that interesting to me -- a mistake. While you will definitely see some great art by any definition, you will also get a much better understanding of the culture and political history/baggage of Buenos Aires, which is the reason that graffiti is so prevalent (and has a totally different context and connotation than in the US). While the street artists might be members of the \"alternative BA\", the graffiti is about all of the city and even the country. My only regret is that we did this on the last day of our trip when it would have been far better to have had the perspective earlier. Our whole family (me, my husband and kids ages 16, 18 and 20) all loved the tour (younger kids would also like it). It really is a \"must do\"."

I wasn't connected much to my email during the trip but had to keep an eye on it to confirm the tour details.I think these tours would be even more popular if the sign-up process was easier.

Graffiti where we come from (NYC) has a negative connotation to it and is not necessarily considered an art form. We were more than pleasantly surprised when Cecilia took us on a tour of some of the best art we saw while in Buenos Aires, at least comparable to those works in the Malba museum.

The pictures are vivid and meaningful, and the artists are very thoughtful behind each piece they display in Buenos Aires. What really made the tour come together was visiting Jazzys studio. It is one thing to see an artists work, it is another to be in their space. Anyone who is in to the art scene of any kind young and old can appreciate the messages and power behind the work.

The visit to one of the artist's studios, with books, gave yet more insight as to how they work, and the final stop at a bar owned and run by an artist was a fitting end. Upstairs on a balcony overlooking the street, the walls are covered with more street art and the paintings for sale are there for buyers who are interested. one needs a drink to contemplate all that one has seen, heard and learnt.

We had been in Buenos Aires for two weeks before signing up for the tour, and just had to know more about the street art scene in the city so we signed up for this tour. It couldn't have been better! We went to lesser known parts of the city to check out loads of great pieces, learned tons about the urban art scene here, from different artists to types of materials they use. At first we wondered why we would need an air-conditioned van, but it is because the tour is three hours and covers a lot of ground in the Palermo/Colegiales areas! What I loved most about the tour was that it is entirely about street art - it's not a city tour with some street art knowledge thrown in. You don't have to know anything about urban art, but this tour is focused entirely on it - but you still come away knowing more about Buenos Aires, Argentine culture, etc. Our guide was so knowledgeable and passionate about the work, and even though there were 15+ on the tour, she took time to talk to each of us and answer all our questions as we walked along and even after the tour she helped everyone out with even more general BsAs questions. If you choose one tour in Buenos Aires, make it Graffitimundo!"

Very informative and the tour was in English so it was easy for us to understand and follow along. We left with a better understanding of the graffiti and street art movement in Argentina and how it differs from the United States. During our tour we were able to meet JAZ, a renowned Argentine street artist and he welcome us into his studio. That was definitely a major bonus!!! Our tour guide was amazing and easy to engage. We really feel like this tour was one of the best that we experienced while on our vacation. We would encourage anyone considering - DO NOT HESITATE - and make sure to bring your camera and comfortable walking shoes. Ciao!"

And I love to see Buenos Aires with the eyes of a tourist, so I know what I'm talking about.Melissa was very clear and friendly and took us to three different neighborhoods that seem to be graffiti hubs of BA.Nice interesting explanations which opened my eyes to what I seemed to see every day, but had not paid too much attention to. Now I see walls and graffiti in Buenso Aires with a different eye.Part of the tour is done with a van through attractive \"barrios\" like Palermo Hollywood and Villa Crespo. And we ended up in a coffee shop fully dedicated to graffiti works, that are on sale. The place itself is all covered with graffiti.I really loved everything in the tour."

Have never really been interested in the political side, or the meaning behind it all, just like the artwork. So was a bit unsure about the whole tour. Eventually decided to take it because i figured it would probably cover the best stuff, and that I may not find all of that on my own.Was very glad I did take the tour, however. As even though I'm still not overly interested in the politics of it all, I did find it very interesting. Found the history of it all particularly interesting, and the fact that there was an organised 'Meeting of the Styles'.Tour may not be for everyone. But I enjoyed it, and I think most people would. Definitely helps to have a well organised and passionate group running it."

The tour guide Melissa was so passionate and knowledgeable about all of the street art that we saw.

We traveled to different neighborhoods by comfortable minibus, where we would walk a bit surveying various pieces before hopping back on for the next stop. I enjoyed learning more about the history of street art in Latin America and its emergence and evolution in BsAs, as well as getting backstories on some of the artists, their methods and motivations. I was impressed and inspired by the openness and collaborative spirit surrounding the scene. The works themselves were typically vibrant, sometimes provocative and often playful. The tour concluded at an art gallery where original works by some of the artists were available for purchase. The graffitimundo team is passionate about its subject matter, which greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the experience. They're very involved in the local scene, and are making a documentary about it, which we got a sneak peek of. Tips: Bring cash if you want to buy art. Most importantly, allow ample time to get to the starting point - if you're traveling by taxi, anything under an hour is going to be a problem. I missed the first part of the tour, so I speak from experience! I took the subte home without any problem, so if I had it to do over, I wouldn't bother fighting traffic in a taxi."

However we had a great time and found it very interesting as the guide, Melissa, was very knowledgeable about both the history of the movement(s) in BA and also the individual artists involved. We saw some great pieces that we would never of seen ourselves and now have a new appreciation for them and the wider context. This tour gave us an insight into a art scene I never thought we would know further than what you see. Very accessible tour which I would recommend to anyone interested in art even if urban art isn't usually your thing. Logistic wise, we always safe and it was well organised. Great value for money.

Maybe if you haven't grown up/lived ever in an urban center this tour would be worth it. I do not think the quality of graffiti is very high; indeed, you will find this is the case as graffiti in Buenos Aires is not illegal. Additionally, many of the \"artists\" are very young (e.g., the artist who likes to draw lines first and then figure out what they are after he has finished). There are a few good artists, but the overall art is not very politically motivated or charged. Its really just teenagers spraying graffiti on walls. You will find higher quality graffiti (in my opinion) in Soho NY (which I think says something) - let alone Berlin or Detroit.The guide we had was very nice and enthusiastic. However, my friends at time rolled our eyes wondering whether they were a bit over eager. We ended the tour early. The tour is safe however and one we took was largely walking oriented. Ask yourself -- why am I the only negative review? Why is this the fourth time I am posting my review before someone complains and tripadvisor deletes it?"

This tour was recommended to me by a friend, and it is the absolute best money I have spent on any sightseeing tour in B Aires. The local arts scene - in this case \u201cgraffiti\u201d - is truly unique. The 3 hour tour was beautifully curated by incredibly passionate and fun people. When you think of the concept of \u2018graffiti\u2019 \u2013 you think of ugly, eyesore type aerosol-ed images of some punk putting his/her name up on a wall. This is NOT what the street art scene is like in B Aires. Sure, there are such images, but these are in the minority. You are given a brief history of the evolution of the graffiti / street art scene in B Aires, which adds to your over appreciation of this amazing city. Here, artists ASK for permission to paint, draw, stencil etc onto walls. While it is not officially legal, it is not officially illegal either. The art works use a combination of paint, tar-paint, aerosols, tiles and other mediums, making for a truly mind blowing tour. Only minor downside is 3 hours is a little long. I reckon 2.5 hours would be better. Toured with a friend, early Sept 2012"

You should also go on this tour if you are looking for some visual inspiration, a little bit of a debate about what constitutes \"art,\" visually interesting spots to take photographs, and some insight into the history and politics of Argentina, as these relate to the work of the artists featured by the tour. We even got to stop by a studio and greet two of the artists whose works we were admiring, which was really fun. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone making a trip to Buenos Aires. A few tips: If you are taking a taxi, expect a lot of time stuck in traffic and give yourself a lot of time to get here. The Subte might be a faster option. Second, if you are running late, there is a bakery a half block north of the meeting location where you can load up on empanadas before dashing off with the group. Third, make sure to have cash on hand. The day ends at a funky bar that has a small gallery with prints by some of the stencil artists, and original paintings by some of the other artists whose work is featured on the tour. Overall, this is a great experience."

You get the chance to see the work of very talented street artists (Jaz was my personal favorite) and you will be told about the different techniques they use. You will also visit one of their studios and end the visit in the \"urban art center\", in which you can see a terrace full of paintings, an exhibition and purchase something if you like.The guide was a foreign girl living in BA for some years now, can't remember her name at the moment.

Thankfully there was a cancellation and were able to grab up last-minute slots. I had noticed the large amount of street art during our first day or so in Buenos Aires, but taking this tour made every other walk afterwards a treasure hunt to look for artists we recognized from the tour and noting the intricacies of some of the art work. Our guide, Kirsty, was great especially considering that we really did have terrible weather at the start of the tour. On account of the weather we stopped by an emerging art studio as well as one of the workspaces of one of the city's most important artists. While appreciated, we didn't accomplish much at either of these visits. I felt that this tour went too long (three hours). My attention span was waning and we started to run short on time for other planned activities. Overall, though, I can't imagine learning more in a tour of a city and I loved learning about the artists and the history of street art in Buenos Aires. I definitely recommend graffitimundo!"

We really enjoyed the tour and hanging out at the bar for a bit after but the most enjoyable thing was walking around the city over the next 4 days and being able to identify the artists' work on the street. After leaving Argentina, we both agreed this was the most worthwhile/enjoyable thing we did while in Argentina.

Earlier this month while visiting out daughter who was doing summer school in Buenos Aires, she had one of her classmates go on a \u201cgraffiti tour\u201d of the city. I thought this sounded really unique, some of the best new artists these days are finding urban graffiti as a way of expressing their abilities. Banksy who resides in London, and has his work popping up internationally, is probably the best known graffiti artist currently. What is unique about this form of street art is that it almost always has some type of theme. Trying to figure out the meaning is half the challenge.Given that little bit of knowledge, we were intrigued to see what a graffiti tour would entail and were certainly not disappointed. We were met at our apartment by Cecilia, a Buenos Aires native, who spent the afternoon taking us around some of the \u201csketchier\u201d places of the night, during the day to see some amazing art work. I was lucky because the day was warm and partly cloudy, perfect for walking, exploring and capturing some images of artwork that is truly Argentinian. Some very political, others more romantic, comedic or simply insightful. Along the way, Cecilia explained the stories behind the images and the history of most of the urban artists who she knows personally. Graffitimundo is a nonprofit collaboration between the artists, a gallery and the tour company \u2013 a superb way to introduce people to the artists, their work and culture."

Don't hesitate to go, even if you have the slightest interest in street art, and if you are somebody like myself who never goes on tours.

Graffitimundo does an excellent job in explaining how this form of street art started in the city and what cultural significance it has. The tour is about 3 hours and our group leader, Ceclia was fantastic. She was articulate and smart, and open to answering any questions we had. They provide an AC van that take you around if the distance you have to travel to see the next set of artwork is a bit far. It was unexpected (I thought we'd be walking for 3 hours) and a happy surprise on a hot BA afternoon. We had a chance to visit the studio where some of the artists work and even meet a few of them. I've been recommending this tour to others here and all have come back from it very pleased. Highly recommended!Should you want to read more/see photos, http://dreamgolive.wordpress.com/2012/02/05/scary-graffiti-or-awesome-graffiti/"

Cecilia is a part of this community, her insight into the political and cultural context as well as thorough understanding of the techniques, styles, and medium of graffiti and street art are authentic. She articulated the story of this young, prolific, relevant and vibrant scene with enthusiasm. We met in barrio Collegiales and walked bait as she gave us background - the tour was in English - and took an air conditioned mini bus for several sections of the otherwise walking tour. We visited several locations with huge, colorful paintings, stencils, aerosol art, drawings, and tiled mosaics. We stopped at a gallery/cafe for refreshments, an art studio (the artist said it was too hot inside but came out to greet us and chat about his current installation) and if finished at a very cool Art Bar called Post Street Bar - it is covered from top to bottom on three levels with a cacophony of styles and color. There were several artists there and a few rooms of shows to view and purchase. Also refreshing ice cold beer. My wife is 30, I am 36, we are from Oakland California and are a part of a vibrant art scene there, so e authenticity was refreshing. It was a great way to understand e politics of Argentina as well as entertaining for the myriad narratives that are woven through this very personal and relevant world of graffiti!"

Not ones to rush, the artists take their time and paint during the day with the permission of the building owners - who often seek out the artists instead of the other way round. Spray paint is imported making it too expensive to use exclusively and so many of the works are in fact murals. This in itself separates BA from other street art cities around the world.The tour is both walking and by mini-bus around the areas of Colegiales, Palermo and Villa Crespo. In addition to the street art, it's a great way to see some different parts of the city.For me, the tour runs a tad too long. That said, you will be well equipped to identify the work of quite a few of the most prolific local artists. I was pleased to see some pieces by Brazilian artists whose work I would see around Sao Paulo. There's quite a healthy and collaborative scene across the continent.Do yourself a favour and do the tour."

You get three hours with a fantastically knowledgeable guide (Cecilia), hearing the stories of BA street art and seeing some of the best examples. The group is small - there were about 12 of us on our tour - so you can ask lots of questions. We visited one of the artists' studios and met a couple of the guys; ended up in Post Bar (Hollywood & Cambodia) for a drink and a look at their latest exhibition. The tour is a mix of walking and short trips by minibus, and you get to see some parts of the city that you might not otherwise visit. All in all, a great afternoon."

So not only you get to learn about a quite interesting emerging art scene in BA, you get to see a lot of local people and businesses that you won't find walking down Florida and visiting malls.If you're lucky you'll even get to meet some of the artists and get a firsthand experience of artsy and underground BA.

The tour was an once informal and extremely informative. Cecelia never seemed scripted and never referred to notes, her knowledge was impressive and her enthusiasm infectious. I was especially impressed by Cecelia's knowledge and savvy regarding the political context. It helps, but is by no means essential, to have some previous knowledge of the art and politics of graffiti, but a curious and open mind will suffice. The bar and gallery visit was a great finish, and the very opposite of the \"exit through the gift shop\" experience you might fear."

In our case, she was able to include a visit to a fire station so that the retired firemen could meet some of the local ones, look around the fire station and check out their firefighting equipment. In addition, because of the group's hobby was rebuilding vintage cars she pointed out some places that those that were interested could visit on their own that included memorabilia of former race drivers. That is the kind of personalized service that Liz provides that I had not experienced with tour guides in other locales."

We visited Recoleta Cemetery, Plaza Mayo (Casa Rosada, Catedral Metropolitana, Museo Cabolido) And then through Puerto Madero to San Telmo and Boca. We had a delightful time.. Liz explained the history and significance of these places in an overall context. For our day's visit there were protests to be held later in the evening. We asked her to frame the relationship of these current affairs into the legacy of the people, of these buildings, and institutions. She offered many views and we learned more about the culture and context of the present. We appreciated her more for having done this.Finally she arranged a tango viewing for us. Wonderful! Thanks Liz"

I had visited Buenos Aires before and didn't really need tourist sightseeing but wanted some insight into how Portenos live and a sense of the local culture. Liz provided that and more. After spending a day with her I came away with a strong feeling for what Buenos Aires is about, warts and all, as well as how it got to be the way it is. If you want an interpreter who can more than point out the sights, I highly recommend Liz."

It took in all the main sites including an incredible view over the Recoleta.

I found many excellent reviews of Liz on Tripadvisor, and contacted her by email.

We were picked up promptly at our hotel, and asked what interested us. She did the same with the other people she picked up. That way she was able to customize the tour based on what we were interested in seeing.Liz has wonderful knowledge of the history of Argentina and Buenos Aires, and also a great understanding of the economy and the problems facing the country.While walking in La Boca, we stopped for lunch and ate outside at a restaurant that featured tango dancers and entertainment. My wife and had had empanadas, which were delicious.We had one person on the tour who wanted to dominate the conversation and at times was more interested in talking about himself than listening to Liz.

She got back to me very quickly and answered all of my questions. Liz also worked with me, my time in Argentina and my budget as I was only one person. One day she even found more people to attend a tour with me to lower the cost! She organized a wonderful half-day tour of Argentina, a full day tour of Tigre and a Tango class. I also found Liz to be a very interesting, warm and heartfelt person (we spent a lot of 1-on-1 time together!). I definitely recommend Liz for personal tours, she really cares about her clients and takes time to organize tours that suit the group."

Three of us hired Liz for a few hours in the afternoon to give us a tour of Buenos Aires during our short stay over in between flights home. She was very communicative at the start and gave us a nice overview of the places she planned to visit during our 4-hour afternoon tour. She then asked us what our interests were to adjust the plans as necessary. Because there were few of us, we did the tour via cab, which also was a unique way to experience the city, and we got out and walked around most of the areas she was highlighting. Liz has a true passion for sharing her love of the history and culture of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and the stories behind the historical sites we visited. I would definitely recommend her!"

This was a special day for Argentinians, the Election Day and a rugby match of Argentina vs Australia at Rugby World Cup. And I greatly appreciate Andrea spent a large amount of the day with me. It was like being with a very knowledgeable friend. We visited several parts of the city including Plaza de Mayo, La Boca, Recoleta, and Palermo and finished the tour at the street market in San Telmo. Andrea is an excellent guide, and visiting all these places without her would not be the same. Behind her impressive knowledge of history, are life stories of Argentinian people in different periods of time, the stories of revolution and dictatorship, the stories of rich and poor, and very poor, which really touch you\u2026. While watching rugby during lunch, Andrea told me that national sport is still football; however Argentina is not performing so well recent years. I also learned about food, and about tango and what it means for Argentinian people. Andrea booked for me the nice little place where I next day enjoyed Tango show and learned basic steps of the dance (was really fun). She also advised me things to do next day such as guided tour of Teatro Colon, that really is impressive and I could only wish to see performance there. Overall, day spent with Andrea was fantastic, and I would highly recommend her, she really personalize the tour and I could not imagine somebody would not enjoy it."

The Recoleta Cemetery was very interesting especially the food left for the cats. We loved all the history of Evita Peron and the Peronistas and the Malvinas war. We felt like we were able to get a good taste of Buenos Aires in 1 day and will definitely want to return to see it in more detail. The Tango show was also a lot of fun!Thanks Andrea and hope to be back someday. Connie and Ray"

A very professional and knowledgeable private tour guide who speaks English very well, she introduced us to so much of the historic, geographic, socio economic, political and architectural aspects of this great Argentinian capital city. Liz Andrea is bright, humorous and fun to be with and takes each visitor into account as she plans her tour days. She is well connected and familiar with all parts of the city as well as the nearby areas of Tigre and Colonia. We chose to focus on the city itself. We visited the Recoleta, Retiro, Centro, and Bocca areas with Liz Andrea. My wife wished to have a leather jacket made while in Buenos Aires and Liz Andrea was of great assistance in the accomplishment of the mission. She also arranged a fabulous dinner and Tango show night for us. Liz Andrea also suggested locations for more in depth visits during the rest of our stay in the city including the Colon Theatre. Walking the streets of a great city is the only way to get to truly get the feel of it. When you do not speak the language and feel you are out of your depth, it is great to have an excellent private tour guide. We were fortunate to have found that person in Liz Andrea while visiting Buenos Aires. We highly recommend her to you when you visit.Barry 123013, Canada"

            "review": "Knowledgeable Guide / Customizable Tour - Highly Recommended. My husband and I recently spent a long weekend in Buenos Aires to celebrate my 40th birthday. Since neither one of us speaks Spanish well, and because there is so much to see in BA, I decided to book a private tour for us and our friends who came with us. I felt like the tour would help orient us to the city, and give us some ideas for things we\u2019d like to do or go see on our own.We\u2019ve done lots of tours in large groups before (particularly on cruises), but I never find those very satisfying. You are rushing from place to place, and things are usually geared towards the lowest-common denominator (someone who has absolutely no knowledge of the country they\u2019re visiting, and who isn\u2019t very mobile). The private tours we\u2019ve done have been good, because the tour guide can usually modify her or his timing and itinerary and customize it. The tour with Liz definitely met that expectation.My husband and I booked the tour for the Friday morning that we landed in BA. Our flight got in at about 6am, and we originally scheduled the tour to start at 10am. I got nervous about possible delays through customs or from the airport, though, and Liz said she was able to adjust to 10:30 with no problem. I shouldn\u2019t have worried - we were able to get to our hotel in the Palermo district with plenty of time to spare. Our friends had arrived the day before, so we were all ready to go by the time Liz showed up.When scheduling the tour, Liz had said that we would be too big a group to rent a car - we could take taxis or else hire a driver and van. We opted for the driver and van; the up charge wasn\u2019t bad at all. When the \u201cvan\u201d showed up, though, we were really surprised. It was actually a mini-bus. It was a little comical for the 5 of us to pile in and out of it throughout the day, but Liz said that it was cheaper to do it that way than to rent a mini-van. The driver was good and the van was comfortable.We started at Recoleta Cemetery, and learned some of the history of the place from Liz. I have been to famous cemeteries in Paris, New Orleans, and other cities - this one definitely belongs near the top of the list for great world cemeteries. She told us interesting stories about some of the notable mausoleums and monuments, and of course showed us where Evita is buried. Afterwards, we walked through the Recoleta district, checking out old mansions that have been converted to hotels and embassies. It really felt like we could have been in a European Capital.From Recoleta, we drove through the new Puerto Madero district, and through el Centro. She pointed out Florida Street as the best place to change US Dollars, and then we made a stop in the La Boca neighborhood. This was definitely a rougher neighborhood than Recoleta, but still beautiful. We walked around admiring the ad-hoc architecture, and Liz took us to a place that changed some of our money (not at as good of a rate as we eventually got on Florida ST, but better than the official rate). We ate at a little courtyard restaurant that was off-the-beaten path from all the tango restaurants in La Boca. The food was good, though, and we definitely felt like we were in another country.After lunch, we went to El Centro and walked around there for a while. We saw the outside of the Pink House, and ended the tour in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral (where Pope Francis served as arch bishop before moving to Rome). As we were wrapping up, Liz arranged for the friends we were traveling with to see a tango show later that night. My husband and I were wiped out after the day of travel and touring, so we opted out of that. The tour was great - I feel like we were lucky to have found someone as passionate and knowledgeable about her country as Liz. I also appreciated her \u201cgo with the flow\u201d approach, as she tailored the tour to the things we wanted to see and were most interested in. I highly recommend a personal tour with Liz if you happen to be traveling to Buenos Aires for some sight-seeing."

We met Liz at the historic Restaurant \"La Biela \"near the huge cemetery in the Recolecta area where Liz told us about the history and politics of Argentina which facts were important to know going around the different neighbourhoods of BA . Starting at the cemetery where Evita Perron is burried and many other historical figures and moving on to the very nice historical \"Palaces\" and buildings now occupied by foreign embassies and major hotels . As a big contrast to this area we moved on in a couple of cabs to the colourful La Boca area where , and it pays to have a good connection like Liz , we got great seats at a \"tango\" Restaurant where we enjoyed some nice local food and enjoyed the dancers including Liz . After lunch we walked some more through this fun part of the city before we went to the major downtown square to go into the Pink Palace where Evita had given her famous speech . We all had a great day and felt richer by all these wonderful experiences and the great tour that Liz had given us . For that we can really recommend booking with Liz .

Liz is a native-born Argentinean and immensely knowledgeable about her home country. Our 6-hr tour of the city began with a short (45-min) overview of the history of Argentina and it's \"ups-and-downs\"...including a good introduction to the current social/political issues of today. Based on our preferences we had arranged prior to our arrival, Liz showed us both historical and cultural sites around the central part of the city (the major cemetery, churches, museums, important buildings and other landmarks) before traveling out to the La Boca area for a sidewalk lunch at a \"tango\" restaurant and viewing the \"artsy\" side streets of this neighborhood. Other neighborhoods were visited before ending our tour back in city center. Liz does not have personal transportation (car, van, etc.), but relies on public transportation for movement about the city. Although initially seen as a negative, using local taxis/buses allows for a better expenditure of your time (Liz isn't hampered with trying to drive/park/etc.). And, in reality, it's another opportunity to experience the BA lifestyle.If you're looking for a custom tour of BA, you will be more than satisfied with Liz for your needs. Be sure to book well in advance in order to communicate exactly your expectations about what to do, where to go and what to see. You won't be disappointed.

We spent some time over coffee when she proceeded to tell us something about the history, politics and culture of this vast and varied city. It was a wonderful way to begin a tour. Since we were spending several days in B.A., she set up our tours so that we could easily return to some of the areas to see them in more depth. Liz is experienced,insightful and passionate about her city. She conveys this to her clients and tours at your pace. If you want to see Buenos Aires in a unique and most interesting way, book with Liz."

Liz has a great knowledge of the areas and its history. It was neat to speak to a local and find out about living in Buenos Aires not just visiting.I thoroughly enjoyed our lunch in La Boca with a platter filled with different meats. The sights there were music to your eyes as it was so colorful.I really appreciate that Liz took the time to determine what interested the guests most so she could cater the tour that way.Highly recommend Liz!"

She gave me some basic history, a sense of the culture and an understanding of the present day political situation.On this second trip I did a half shopping tour with Liz. Yes, she knows where the nice shops are but more importantly she knows where to get the best quality for the best price. She also gives you information so you can continue on own. And if you are into tango like she is she can direct you to the best places to buy tango shoes and clothes.It is more like seeing the city and going shopping with a friend than a tour guide!"

After 30 minutes, you have the feeling of being guided around Buenos Aires by one of your best friends! She gives an introduction to the city and the history of Argentina which really puts everything you are about to see into a perspective and context, so the sightseeing becomes a lot more insightfull and meaningfull than usual! Also, Liz is very attentive to your preferences and what you would like to see and at which pace. This was probably the best Investment we could do into getting a fascinating and friendly introduction to Buenos Aires. Also, one day with Liz definitely left us very well prepared for the next days and nights we would be exploring the city on our own as she equipped us with many great tips on restaurants, sights, museums and bars.

Liz was far more than a tour guide, she was the travel agent, personal manager, body guard, political commentary, historian, an honest good person, and someone you would feel safe in leaving your children with. She started us off with a history lesson so we could understand how Buenos Aires, and Argentina have evolved. That put in framework the things that we saw. She took us to places where the locals go, where the tourists go and to where ever you wanted to go. She was flexible with changes in weather, personal needs to exchange money, or our personal desires. It was truly a great trip. We wanted more and she gave us boats on the Triger, Soccer stadiums, Gauchos and Estancia, and yes we learned how to conduct, equip for, and ride in a polo game. Liz is highly responsive. She will always respond to you within 24 hours. She makes things happen that we did not believe could be scheduled at the last minute. Thank you again Liz...you are great."

I saw Liz's reviews on here and contacted her to see if we could arrange a full day tour. She emailed me within 5 minutes, was extremely informative, and before you know it we were booked! She actually helped me book a FANTASTIC tango show and dinner the night before, a night I will never forget. The service and food were top notch, and it comes recommended by Liz as she goes to these herself to ensure the highest quality. I also ended up getting a discount as she reserved in local pesos, rather than doing it from abroad. Liz showed up the next morning at 10, asked me a bit about what I was interested in, and soon we delved deep into the political, economic, and cultural history of Argentina. She set up the tour beautifully, she is extremely knowledgeable and adapt the tour to your interests and previous expectations. In a nutshell, we hit Recoleta, Boca, Puerto Madero, and the pink house, while having lunch in Boca watching tango. All along the way Liz gave insightful and entertaining stories that looped back to our initial history lesson, and also gave her own perspective as a Argentinean growing up in BA. She is delightful, insightful, and easy to get along with, and was well worth the time and money. I would HIGHLY recommend Liz to anyone who wants a personalized tour of BA with an amiable and fun tour guide. Thanks Liz!"

She started off by meeting us in the lobby of our hotel and giving us a brief description of the history of the city and the sites we were planning on visiting that day. Starting off with this overall brief really helped to put things into perspective when we were touring. Besides having a wealth of knowledge about BA's history, Liz is also well informed both economically and politically. It was really great to be able to converse with someone who understands the factors that play into these facets of the city. She isn't your typical tour guide regurgitating from a memorized script, she is an insightful and intelligent guide who is clearly passionate about her city and wants to share all of its brilliance as well as some of its darker sides with you. Admittedly, I'm not someone who typically enjoys tours because I'd rather read the script someone is going to feed me rather than pay to be read to. This was nothing like that and I'm very glad that my girlfriend booked Liz because I learned so much more than I would have ever thought. Not only did I learn a lot but I had a lot of fun! Liz is very sociable and incredibly charismatic that you can't help but adore her. She explains things in such a manner that what could be a boring history lesson from one person is a fascinating and interesting story from Liz. It was like spending the day with a friend showing us around the city. Although we were only spending one day with her, Liz also gave us suggestions on what else to do during the rest of our stay based on our interests. I would not hesitate to recommend Liz to any of my friends visiting BA and the next time we visit the city, I would absolutely hire Liz again for one of her other tours. Thanks Liz!"

She is very easy going as well so you can customize things as you go depending on your interests. She arranged reservations for both a tango show and wine tasting for us and they were each fantastic. I appreciated that she works with smaller boutique places rather than the more mass market tourist traps. The tango show was spectacular and the dinner we had there was quite good as well and the wine tasting was great as well. The wine tasting was relaxed, informative and led by a terrific host with a great personality who was very informative as well. We had a great time there and even bought a case of wine afterward to bring home. Liz also had some great suggestions for things to do on the days my wife and I were exploring the city on our own.We learned so much from Liz that it really made our week in BA far better than if we had just relied on some information in guide books.

She is very well versed in her country\u2019s history and does an outstanding job explaining the key points to you. We then proceeded on our tour and at each stop Liz explained how the site related to Argentina\u2019s history. Having that summary before the tour really helped you to put the pieces together.

The tour is great as you can decide if you like a place enough that you want to return on your own to explore some more. It also gives you an idea of how big the city is. Liz also arranged a tango show/dinner which was pretty good. All in all it was a great day and we ended up returning to a lot of the places on the tour again on our own. So if you are headed to Bs.As contact Liz and she will show you her city for which she has a passion."

She took us from one end of the city to the next and never missed a beat about the culture, the significance of a place, the history of the district or the odd little bit of information about the race track or polo field that we passed that made the tour memorable.

She met us at our hotel in Recoleta and we spent about an hour learning about the history and politics of Argentina from the Spanish conquest forward. She is facile in explaining the complex and tempestuous history of the culture and politics of this nation which are difficult to sort out for the visitor--even those interested in geopolitics. She was senstive to what we wanted to see and was very careful not to divulge her own politcal leanings until she understood our perspectives. Her family has been in Argentine for at least three generations, so she has experienced first hand or through her parents or grandparents' memories much of the last 75 years of tumult in this country. They came as hard-working immigrants (like almost all Argentines). She is a good teacher and gave us erudite explanations of all we saw, in an historical/political context, from the Recoleta cemetary, to the metropolitan cathedral, to the protestor in front of the \"red house\". It was a pleasure to hear her interpretation of ancient events as well as more recent gossip about Papa Francis and President Cristina Fernandez Krishner. An juicy and possibly true stories about the corpse of Eva Peron. We went to lunch in La Boca at a not very good restaurant, and enjoyed this part of the city the least. (Might want to skip this colorful, but touristy part of BA.) Liz is expensive, but we felt she provided good value. We were quoted a price of 100.00 a head and paid that even though we went from two to four clients. She is an Afficianado of the Tango and participates herself frequently, She referred us to Gala Tango with tango lession, dinner and excellent show. We enjoyed it--frist rate muscians and dancers. Know what you want to see and she will be better able to tailor your day's outing. We started at 10AM and finshed at 5PM.SInce in my opinion tourism at its best introduces us not just to sights but also to culture and different ways of perceiving and living the human experience, I think Liz is excellent and I can recommend her easily and gladly. I would use her again if I returned to this interesting, complicated culture of Tango and the Disapeared; of and Francis and Cristina."

I went into NYTimesTravel and found great comments about Liz so I hired her. She is a lovely person and knows a lot about Buenos Aires life during day and nights. I stayed 4 days at least and she organized all things to do (touristics and not touristics) so I went into the local culture and learn a lot about Argentina with her.She also recommended an Hotel as soon as I contact her and that was a good suggestion. I stayed at a nice one, not expensive and at a good location. But she has bee working with many and will tell you the truth between your choices. You can find a long list at her site www.lizflor2.blogspot.com where she wrote about \" accomodations\".I highly suggest you to do a tour with her. She is so puntual, has everything in mind and all the connections in the city to make your day easy.I spent long hours during day and 2 eve nights enjoying the Tango . Really good!"

            "review": "Energetic, personable, knowledgeable. We hired Liz as our guide for 2-1/2 days in Buenos Aires based on Trip Advisor reviews and Liz\u2019s website. We were not disappointed. As other reviewers have said, her knowledge of history, politics, and culture of Argentina is encyclopedic and provided an excellent framework for our short visit. She knows the \u201cins and outs\u201d for getting around town. There were four people in our group, and Liz was flexible enough to handle some changes in her original plans in order to accommodate us. She also had to make some revisions based on the unusually cold weather (by local standards) that we had during our stay in BA \u2013 we can confirm that Liz knows the best places to get hot chocolate! We were lucky because the big agriculture show was underway, and that was especially interesting \u2013 of course we would never have known about it on our own. I think that when you leave a place and the guide has made you want to come back, the guide has done a good job. Liz made sure we would all have good memories of Buenos Aires and a desire to return there to see and learn more. The only thing I would suggest is that if there are going to be 4 or more people in your party, think about working with Liz ahead of time to arrange a driver with a car big enough for everyone. We split up into two cabs, which worked pretty well, but it would have been more fun if we\u2019d all been together. I just didn\u2019t think of that while I was making BA arrangements."

I've been to BA 20 times or so on business, but when I would read travel articles, I knew there was so much more to see than just the small area (office, hotel, restaurants, and park) that I know so well. I wanted to explore something new and take my wife along on this trip, but my wife insisted that we hire a local guide to make sure we would see the great spots. My wife was right, and Liz was the right guide for us. She really took good care of us and helped to \"economize\" our time so that we saw the best in just a few days. -- Liz even helped us plan our own trip to Tigre (delta). It was a great side trip, but my wife and I agreed that we probably should have hired Liz to go with us for the day."

After which my daughter was heading to Cordoba for a 6 month stay in Argentina. So we really wanted to get the lay of the land, and Liz did not disappoint at all. First Liz has a wonderful command of the English language. She is passionate about her country and wanted to show us the ins and outs, politics, economic and the history of BA and Argentina.Previous to us arriving in Argentina, Liz asked what we were interested in and then planned our trip around our interests.She arrived at our hotel on time and proceeded to lay out the history of Argentina from past to present. Which was very interesting for sure. We would have two days with Liz and quite possibly could have used a third.We headed out after about an hour and jumped into a taxi and off we went. City tour, walking tour, tango dancing in Boca(which was simply amazing, especially the 8 year old gaucho dancing), all very authentic for sure. Liz is a tango dancer as well but was injured when we were there, would have loved to see her dance, she was so passionate about it! Would have loved to have gone to a local milonga and dance. Cemetery in Recoleta where Evita was buried. Local spots, shops, fairs. We went to TIgre Delta another day, on the coast train and river boat. Beautiful country. Liz was a great choice, and I will tell everyone who will listen, you must book her. Wonderful tour guide."

My partner and I spent three wonderful days with Marcelo in June and July. Prior to arriving in BA we gave Marcelo a rough idea in what we were interested in visiting - no to churches, yes to architecture, gardens, cafes.BA's weather wasn't kind to us on our first day but Marcelo planned around it as we taxied and wandered the wonderful neighbourhoods of BA. His encyclopaedic knowledge of the city that he loves, and Argentina in general, is amazing!! On the second day the weather cleared and we took full advantage by crisscrossing the city by taxi and public bus. We especially loved our visits to the historic cafes of BA. Our third day was on our return to BA after a trip to Peru that included walking the Inca Trail. To be honest we were exhausted and Marcelo tailored the day so that it was at a much more leisurely pace. We wanted to take Marcelo to lunch and asked for a recommendation of a 'locals' restaurant and Juana M. was perfect. A beautiful venue serving beautiful food staffed by excellent waiter staff. We can't recommend Marcelo enough. He showed us a BA we would never have seen on our own. Wonderful architecture, beautiful neighbourhoods, excellent cafes, frank and honest discussion about politics, economics and culture. We had never used a private guide before but after our amazing experience with Marcelo we can only hope our guides in the future are even half as good."

The private customized tour with Mr. Marcelo was the best city tour I ever have in my travel life as he tailor his tours according to customers interests. So, before we heads-up to our planned tour, he sat with us in the hotel lobby for 15 minutes to discuss and understand our points of interest and the areas that we had in our wish list so he can plan the day accordingly. The city tour was a combination of free walk, taxi and bus rides mainly to have blend feeling of Buenos Aires local transportation and get close to the hustle and bustle of the city. It was very successful and enjoyable full day tour with very professional guided tour. At the end of the trip, the guide provided us with an organized folder full of useful handy information about best restaurants, shopping and attractions in city so we can refer to it during our remaining days in the city.

Marcelo is not only an experienced tour guide, professional, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable, he is also a warm, easy going, friendly person we enjoyed spending time with. Marcelo speaks excellent English. Our communication was always efficient. We met at the hotel lobby always on time, and reviewed our itinerary every day before leaving the hotel. Marcelo always listened to our suggestions, and made sure to design the itinerary the way we could see the best of the city. He provided a folder with great suggestions on sightseeing, the restaurants, and the museums, and taught us basic Spanish words. We discussed Argentina history, architecture and politics, and we learned many interesting facts about the sites we visited. In the end of our daily tours we reviewed the sites we\u2019ve seen, and it was truly amazing how much we managed to see during these trips. Another great quality we would like to comment on, it\u2019s his flexibility. We were able to make last minute changes to our tours due the weather, and we also were able to personalize our tours according to our interests, and it worked out great! We absolutely recommend Marcelo tours while visiting Buenos Aires. Thank you very much for sharing your city with us!"

I only had two days to spend in this beautiful city, so it left little time for discovering the savory dishes offered here, or even the upscale shopping it is know for. Marcelo planned out two days of discovering many of the local neighborhoods, walking to enjoy the sights and sounds each area had to offer. My goal of discovering the joy of the Tango was satisfied with Marcelo's recommendations for evening performances that were outstanding. He arranged for my transportation to and from the airport that came off without a hitch. Marcelo is an intelligent, knowledgeable, and personable man with great pride in his home town and loves to show it off. Thank you Marcelo for sharing two wonderful whirlwind days in BA!!!"

I had told my friend how wonderful Marcelo was from my time with him 18 months ago. We started our first evening at the wonderful restaurant Oviedo to enjoy ourselves before our two full days of sightseeing with him. This trip I opted for a car and driver so we could make the most of our time. My friend fell in love with Marcelo from the start and was so impressed with his broad knowledge of Buenos Aires and Argentina. There was never a time we asked him a question from the arts to politics to the economy that he didn't have an answer. Amazing!! This was a very quick trip filled with great food and shopping! If we were looking for something in particular, Marcelo knew where to find it. I had been reading some books on 20th Century Argentina and had many questions about specifics and he gave me excellent answers to my questions. He laughed and at one point said he was very surprised I knew about that particular event. We had only one night free and asked about a local steakhouse that wasn't filled with tourists, he suggested one that was outstanding, The food was bountiful and delicious and not far from Recoleta. I cannot say enough great things about Marcelo. He is very funny also and can be a teaser as he did to me when were in the San Telmo antique area and told the driver to go slowly but not stop. He remembered my love of antiques and knew we would be on one street all afternoon. If you want the best, you have found the best!!"

Our questions ended up becoming fun conversations and discussions, not only about the sights around us, but about history, politics and life in Buenos Aires in general. He also provided a wide range of more \"local\" suggestions for restaurants, shopping, things to do etc... In the nicest way possible, he will also try to steer you away from falling in certain tourist traps if you are so tempted. E.g. certain restaurants are known to give significant kickbacks to hotel concierges for references which you end up paying for. Together with Helena of Clandestino Music Travel, Marcelo gave us a real great taste of the city, that we want to go back and experience more of the city with him."

I strongly recommend hiring him shortly after arrival.

For example, he directed me to a old-style Argentine pizza place (El Cuartito) that was not only delicious but clearly a favorite of many--there was a line of locals waiting before it opened for lunch. His tours were very enjoyable. I was happy to walk for the most part but you should be prepared to cover any taxis (utterly cheap in BA) or entrance fees as they are not included in his fees.

Ma is 82 and in a wheelchair.He knew so much about his city, and put a lot of information together to give us perspective. He could tell us about local cafes, restaurants and ice cream places.WITHOUT hesitancy, I would recommend Marcello as your guide. We would be back in a hearbeat."

Once arriving in his city he met us on time, every time, for the four days he was with us. Before we left on our first tour he sat down with us and laid out our four days, which we could have altered if we wanted to, but we never did because his plans were just perfect! Our first couple days we walked, which gave us a great opportunity to get to know each other and to get a real feel for the neighborhoods. On the remaining days we realized we were a bit old and tired, and very simply switched over to taxis, very inexpensive taxis, and finished our tour that way. Marcelo himself was more than we could have hoped for... so knowledgeable, so fun, and had the three of us in good moods all day long. He also arranged all of our travel to the port and the airport even after our tour was sadly over. Thanks to Marcelo we will always remember Buenos Aires as a wonderful city and will miss it, but just as importantly we will remember him and miss him."

We couldn't have been happier with the experience. Marcello was very good with pre-trip communications. We worked out details for a vehicle rental in advance and everything was very clearly communicated. He even answered several questions we had about transportation from the airport to our hotel and questions we had about currency. He was very helpful on the tour when one of us needed language help at a pharmacy. The tour included some local spots that we would not have found on our own. The pizza and empanadas at lunch were amazing and we had a stop at a local bar that was also fun. We found Marcello very flexible and he accommodated our requests to modify the basic tour because we were already planning to see certain things on another day. Highly recommended!"

We had to hire a limo at additional expense to get us around the city which is quite large. This needs to be addressed up front and I would suspect that many of his clients fall into this category. That aside he does a wonderful job of bringing Buenos Aires alive and is full of history and vignettes about it. His performance was a worthy addition to the tour of this city which is a wonderful place to visit."

My wife and I were on an extended vacation which began in Cape Town and wound up with us disembarking the Oceania Marina in Buenos Aires on 22 December 2015. I had been planning this trip for a long time and had the good fortune of selecting Marcelo to be our guide while we were in Buenos Aires. He was one of several guides I contacted in planning the trip but his communication was outstanding and his commitment to fulfilling our requirements was obvious. He not only conducted our tours but he also booked our transportation from the port to our apartment in Palermo and from our apartment to EZE airport for our return flight to the U.S. which is tomorrow. He did not ask for extra compensation for these services and he in fact reconfirmed the transportation the day before it was scheduled. This was not small task because we took 4 day trips to Mendoza and to Iguazu Falls requiring transportation to the local airport for both trips.When we travel, we try to not just see a city or an area but to understand it. Marcelo is the guy that can do that for you in Buenos Aires. He earned his 4 year college degree in tourism but more than that he knows and understands Buenos Aires past and present. If you tour with Marcelo it won't be a drive around \"on the left you can see a (fill in the blank}\" kind of tour. it will be a feet on the street walk around through neighborhoods and historic sites with a full explanation about how and why those neighborhood came to be and the significance past and present of historic sites. If you listen, you will know Buenos Aires when you are through.We had the luxury of touring with Marcelo for two full days and two half days. In that time we visited (I will likely forget some fascinating place and for that i apologize) Recoleta and the world famous Recoleta Cemetery, Retiro, Palermo, San Telmo, La Boca, Puerto Madero, and Tigre. We came away understanding the significance and differences in those areas. We came away better understanding how Buenos Aires evolved and what it is today. Because of the distance involved to reach some of these locations we had the opportunity to take taxis, a train, a bus, and a sight seeing boat. What a thrill.Since so much walking was involved on some of these days, Marcelo was always checking to make sure we were okay, if we needed to stop for a coffee, drink, or snack, and to make sure we didn't over extend ourselves. He always explained the distances we had to go and gave us the opportunity to take a taxi if we preferred. We usually didn't. There is so much more to see when you walk the neighborhoods. We felt connected to the city that way. We have rarely had a tour guide that was so aware of our needs as individuals. I have gotten a little sappy but that is because we thoroughly enjoyed our time with Marcelo and appreciate what we learned from him. For that, we have Marcelo to thank. Muchas gracias Marcelo! Muchas gracias!"

After reading all his great remarks here at TA you might wonder if someone like Marcelo exists. And yes, he does and very much so. Prompt replies beforehand when making our booking as well as adjustments to our interests. We had a full day of excursion in the city with occasional transfers by taxi to different areas of the town. As mentioned in other reviews he has a university degree in Tourism, knows and can pedagogically communicate Argentinian history and historic events in fluent English. On top of that, we were informed about current political and social developments and we had several interesting discussions on those topics too. And to add another thing, we had great fun also - something which is important if you are supposed to spend a whole day together. To summarise - a Marcelo full day tour is a perfect introduction to Buenos Aires! And if you don't take it, you won't get his personal and \"secret\" key addresses for genuine and great restaurants (we know since we tried them)! Thanks Marcelo!"

When it was too rainy and cold to continue one of our daytime tours, he rearranged his schedule so that we could make up the time on the following day, when the sun was shining. He joined us two times for dinner, both of which he arranged for at popular restaurants, one in a renovated warehouse (with an art gallery motif) in the Retiro District, the other in Puerto Madero, along the waterfront in the city's largest redevelopment project. He also led us to several local cafes, where he introduced us to different types of coffee and local favorite treats.

He is a native Porteno with a university degree in Tourism. He came to our hotel, met with us, and established a personalized tour based on our input. My wife and I spoke of the things we learned from him for the rest of our trip! Highly recommended!!"

Marcelo listened to what my interests and expectations were, and tailored the tour accordingly. My visit to Buenos Aires certainly would not have been the same without a day spent with Marcelo. So much so that I look forward to reconnecting with him the next time I am in Argentina!"

He's a master at figuring out what you're looking for and then creating a tour that fits your tastes, time, and budget. He considers it part of his service to help you with any pending logistics. For us, this was helping with the purchase of tickets to Colonia. We walked the City and his explanations of history, politics, and culture (tango anyone?) were great. His restaurant recommendations were outstanding. An Argentine submarine is not something you should miss. I've used guides in Spain, Israel, and other countries. I highly recommend Marcelo as someone who will make your trip fun and memorable."

Marcelo managed to make each day a treat for all of us. He met us and took into consideration what we were interested in doing. His knowledge of history and current events was amazing and extremely interesting and an enhancement to our visit. He went even beyond just being our guide. He booked our car service, suggested restaurants, scheduled a tour of the Opera, and even managed to retrieve my phone left behind. Thank you Marcelo!!"

Safety was a big concern to Marcelo (taxis, areas, do not exchange money on the street, it can be counterfeit). He gave us a list of eateries (types of food, quality), clubs, museums. Then Marcelo took us to several areas (mausoleum cemetery, church and down town area). Marcelo's discussions on the history and explanation of the culture truly helped us get a better understanding of what we were seeing and experiencing. Highly recommend his services."

I have traveled extensively and have used many private guides and I can honestly say Marcelo Alejandro Mansilla was one of the best guides I have ever used.I had read reviews of the top rated guides and reached out to several of them. From the start he excelled. Marcelo responded promptly, his emails were clear and concise and he suggested itineraries based on our interests. Due to availability we were able to secure Marcelo for two days and used two other guides on other days. Marcelo exceeded our expectations all around. He is prompt, personable, speaks excellent English and has a wealth of knowledge of BA and its history and politics. He gave us an extensive map of the city as well as his personal recommendations of things to do and places to eat. He was flexible and adjusted the tour to our interests. The best part of it was that it was ENJOYABLE. We spent a lot of time with him and it was like seeing the city with a friend. In my opinion, he was far superior to our other private guides on this trip. Ironically, he was the one guide who didn\u2019t ask us to give a five star TA review or none at all. This seems to be a growing trend not only in BA but other in other parts of the world as well. I was under the impression that TA was a forum for travelers to help fellow travelers not free advertising for vendors!"

I didn't do much planning but i did find reviews on Marcelo. i couldn't find any of my friends to go so went by myself. I didn't know the city but hired Marcelo for 2 full days and he helped so much for me getting to know the city. Here are the main reasons I such a good experience1. Marcelo came to my place the first meeting and sat down with me to discuss the goals of my trip. Then he came up with ideas and let me choose from them. We planned both days then;2. I'm a CPA and am always early to things and irritated if people don't show on time. Marcelo was always prompt;3.I'm a light hearted guy and enjoy tourist things but also enjoy joking around with people. I let Marcelo know that, especially as I can only absorb so much history in one day. We had great conversations, coffee breaks, lunch breaks but he was always considerate in asking if that's what i wanted. I enjoyed sitting and having coffee and discussing fun and interesting subjects about our lives and just joking around about things; 4. Despite hanging out with a great guy, he's very professional and very knowledgeable about the sites and history. I learned ton of interesting things that I would never have learned about on say a bus tour;5.Marcelo would tell me some of the sites i might want to visit on my free days; 6. I had multiple questions that i emailed him about, even after my tours and he always promptly replied with great advise. He even answered questions before my trip and recommend an agency that games tourists to futbol games;7. He made me feel safe. I needed to change money and knew about the Blue Dollar rate. I asked him and he took me to a safe place that the locals use to exchange money at good rates. I can't say enough about my positive experience and would recommend him to anyone."

I already knew his written English was impeccable so I was not surprised to hear his absolutely perfect, spoken English. His enthusiasm and love for his city was evident immediately and his knowledge of its history was inspiring. Our tour included parts of Retiro and Recoleta and it was full of facts and insight delivered with an obvious joy and passion. In Marcelo's capable hands the history of Buenos Aires came alive.I usually don't hire a guide when I travel but I recommend, unequivocally, hiring Marcelo for all the reasons, stated above, and also because the city is vast and full of wonders and you'll need help deciding what to see. I have 2 regrets, the first is not hiring Marcelo for a full day instead of the 4 hours that we chose and second, after returning from hiking in Patagonia we waited too long in contacting Marcelo for a second tour, not surprising, he was already booked. Book as soon as you have finalized plans to visit and believe me after touring with Marcelo you will run to Trip Advisor to add your own \"Excellent\" rating."

First day in BA was with Marcelo and he provided all the info one could need for a great adventure in a city we knew nothing about. After a great tour, he reviewed our itinerary and made a number of suggestions and restaurant recommendations - most of which we followed and were very happy with. I highly recommend Marcelo for English speaking, first timers in BA."

My husband and I (30's from NYC) were debating between Marcelo and another top rated private tour guide, and ultimately chose Marcelo: His responsiveness was super quick, thorough, and clear. Even after our tour was over, Marcelo continued to be available to answer various questions we had throughout our stay in Argentina. What a great choice we made choosing Marcelo! We spent the entire day from 10am - 5pm with Marcelo and saw the entire city. He helped us exchange money in the morning and subsequently took us to all the main attractions. He knew of the best cafes to stop in for lunch, and the places where (nice) restrooms were easily available - very important when you're out for the entire day! There was never a dull moment in conversation... I only wish we had more time together. Overall, do not hesitate to book with Marcelo... the tour was absolutely worth every single penny!"

Buenos Aires is a very difficult city to navigate if you don't speak Spanish and Marcelo's excellent English, his knowledge and love of Buenos Aires, and flexibility make it so worth the time and money. He tailors the tour to exactly what you want to see--culture, history, shopping, restaurants whatever. He is fun, easy to get a long with and someone you just would want to hang out with...Highly recommend. We learned more about Buenos Aires than our friend who is a native!"

Marcelo speaks excellent English and is very approachable and works hard to tailor a tour to your individual preferences.My girlfriend and I spent our first day in Buenos Aires with Marcelo. This turned out to be one of the smartest things we could have did. Not only did he teach us a ton about the history, architecture and other details of the city and people of Buenos Aires. But he got us very acclimated to the various areas of the city which helped us throughout the remainder of our trip. He also gave me some helpful hints on exchanging money and provided us with a nice map and numerous recommendations on places to eat and drink. We were fortunate enough to try a lot of them and nothing disappointed us.Not only do I feel like we found an excellent tour guide to share with any of our friends fortunate enough to visit his great city but we have a new friend in Buenos Aires that we look forward to visiting again with in the future. Thanks for a great full day tour!!!!!!"

Please do believe he is a treasure-engaging, fun, knowledgeable, trustworthy, humorous, friendly, organized, meticulous etc. His dedication to providing excellent service is unrivaled. Marcelo has an open, inquisitive mind so he is constantly learning and evolving which trickles down to his tours. As he said to me \" I like to travel in time\". Our story: My husband and I have never hired a private guide before, preferring to do it all on our own after our research, but felt the need for help for our first South America trip. Since TA has never let us down I contacted Marcelo. I came up with a plan for the 2 full days we spent with him; he perfected it. I could feel how dedicated he was through the many emails we generated. We loved our experience with him, not expecting to be as comfortable touring with him as we were. My husband ( CPA) was particularly impressed with the depth of his economic knowledge, saying that Marcelo knew some minutiae he didn't think his colleagues did. Before leaving him on the 2nd day he said to feel free to contact him with any questions or issues. Now returned home and thinking of our time in Buenos Aires we have more thoughts and questions, so Marcelo's tutelage continues long distance as we took him up on his offer. He is a teacher, a friend, and a ( well behaved) little brother all in one!"

He had some really helpful advice regarding exchanging dollars to pesos at a favorable exchange rate. He showed up on time at our hotel on the appointed day and took the time to ask us about our interests and what we'd like to do before we got started. We had a great tour of the San Telmo market on a Sunday and also some of the more central tourist locations near the Obelisk and in Microcentro. The next day he gave us a tour of the Recoleta cemetery, which was one of the highlights - there is no need to struggle to find Evita's mausoleum, Marcelo knows exactly where it is. He speaks excellent English and is very open to answering questions about Argentina's current state as well as its history - he really brought a valuable new dimension to our time in BA, and we thoroughly enjoyed his company.

The tour itself was excellent as he provided a very thorough history to the city that clearly means a lot to him. We booked a full day tour with him and at no point did it ever feel like things were dragging along.

Marcelo is, in a word, phenomenal.From the very first, Marcelo proved himself to be consummately professional yet also warm and engaging. I sent him an email a few weeks before traveling to Buenos Aires and his reply was prompt and informative describing his philosophy and approach to guiding visitors through his city. Specifically, he met up with my partner and me at our hotel in the morning and, rather than having a set plan of what to show us, he talked with us to determine what our particular interests were and how best to tailor our day to emphasize them. As a result, Marcelo was able to strike just the right balance of showing and explaining historical sites and the events surrounding them, highlighting the culture and cuisine of \"real\" porte\u00f1os, and making us feel as though we were sharing all of this with a new friend. Indeed, Marcelo is armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of the city's history and culture from end to end and therefore is completely versatile in his ability to tailor the day to exactly what, when, and where his guests want to see and do.Marcelo offers both half-day and full-day tours; we opted for the latter and were very glad that we did. No maps or tour books (or, for that matter, large-group tour guides) ever could have allowed for the personalized, interesting, and most importantly, fun experience of Buenos Aires that Marcelo afforded us. For instance, it would be fairly useless for us as newcomers to wander through Recoleta Cemetery or the Plaza de Mayo without Marcelo's spot-on explanations of the history and iconography of these important and complex sites. Not only did he stick to a script, though; it seemed that whether it was some random mausoleum I pointed out in the cemetery or a heraldic element of the Argentine coat of arms, he knew the ful story behind it. Needless to say, his English is perfect but nevertheless was, thankfully, very patient with my attempts at practicing Spanish! Marcelo's passion for his hometown is infectious; through spending the day with him, my partner and I were able to get into just the right mindset to best enjoy the city. In order that we could continue to get the most out of our visit even after parting ways, he provides his guests with an annotated guide of his own writing to the city's best eateries, attractions, etc. that proved very useful to us throughout the rest of our stay. In sum, I cannot recommend Marcelo enough, but certainly can warn that you would be missing out tremendously not to get the chance to see Buenos Aires through his eyes."

This made for some interest discussion as we walked the streets of the city. His English is also excellent, so conversation was easy and plentiful.As validation of how much we enjoyed and appreciated our time with Marcelo, I should point out that it rained much of the time that we were doing our tour. We truly managed to overlook the nasty weather and simply enjoyed the setting and our conversation.Our time with Marcelo was the perfect way to start our five day visit in BA.

This is a long review because Marcelo unreservedly deserves the accolades...We had decided to hire a personal guide like before in other cities and Marcelo's name came up with great recommendations. So as to maximise our time we had, we asked Marcelo for a half day afternoon guide tour as well as the following day, and we are so glad we did. Nothing was too much of an issue for Marcelo, so much so that he wanted to collect us from our B&B that afternoon and arrived right on time. He asked could we sit with him before we do anything so he could get a feel for what we were after and wanted to see. This was 30 minutes well spent, as from this sit down, he drafted a plan for that afternoon and the following day. Off we went and no sooner out the door, our lessons to get comfortable with BA began, i.e. how to catch a taxi, where to stand, what gesture to use, and which type of taxi, and how to pay. We needed to change money and Marcelo helped us with that as well.From there we began walking and he began talking, and we learnt so much in just those few hours. I won\u2019t go into where we went or what we did, as that\u2019s for you to find out and draft your plan yourself. When he left us that afternoon (6pm is afternoon in BA) in the heart of town, he pointed to a couple cafes where we could go for our afternoon snack, where to catch our taxi back home, and said he would see us the next morning. He also suggested a great meeting spot since we were now confident to catch a taxi. So we left Marcelo, grabbed a coffee, looked at our photos from that afternoon, and discussed between us what we had just done and learnt about Argentina the city, the people and the history of it all.Next day we arrived in the centre of the city and met Marcelo who took us to a famous caf\u00e9 for coffee and more learning. We spent time over coffee with a map that Marcelo provided and said it was ours to keep, and he explained where we had been yesterday, and what he had planned for today, and at the same time marked up places for us to visit by ourselves over the next couple of days.Off we went exploring, and the stories from Marcelo continued, and the pieces were all coming together; we felt like we were in our own modern day screenplay and the story was coming to alive as we visited buildings, statues, gardens, parks, and suburbs of BA. We took lunch where the real people of BA have lunch\u2026not some fancy tourist style restaurant, but an exciting vibrant caf\u00e9. That afternoon we rode the public bus and learnt how to do so for future travelling. We also learnt how to take the subway, all the time keeping familiarised to our map. Often Marcelo would test us and ask where do we think we are now! It\u2019s what I call learning as you go. We walked past iconic tourist attractions, where he would say you can visit these yourselves and when was the best time to avoid crowds etc.So when it came to the end of our tour that afternoon, Marcelo\u2019s story he had been sharing with us from 1pm the previous day had all come together. We now understood why BA is the way it is today. We had been taken on a journey of discovery from way back in the 1800s, through the wars, the revolutions, and into modern day BA. I could go on about it, but I will leave that for you all to discover yourselves.So re Marcelo, this was now our 4th private guide for South America and clearly the best yet. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the others were good, but Marcelo\u2019s unique way of showcasing BA and all it has to offer was so different to what we had before. Not only did we learn about Argentina, but we now were confident to tackle the remainder ourselves using public transport, and how to spot the good from the bad.He also provided a comprehensive list and details of all sorts of things we could do whilst in BA - he was the only guide we've had that has provided this type of thing!If I could sum up Marcelo, it was like having your own personal concierge who knows the place only too well, where to shop, where to eat, where to get the best exchange rates, and when to go, and at what time to get the best value. But his service didn\u2019t stop with us when we left him that afternoon as he offered via email if we needed some assistance for the remaining time we were there. We took him up on that and can proudly say that he found us what we were looking for.I'm sure you can gather from my review that we loved Marcelo, and we wish him all great things in the future because he deserves it. He's simply the best!"

Knowledge of all the historical spots; someone to help you cut through all the mass tourist scene to get to places really worth seeing? Perhaps you want someone to give you an insiders interpretation of culture, economic and political factors or maybe you just want pleasant company while you see the sights.You can have all of this and so much more with Marcelo. I have yet to encounter his equal anywhere else. If there was an award for international tour guide of the year he would be a top contender for it, no question.Marcelo is a prompt, efficient, very intelligent and cultured young man who knows his city backwards and wants to help you explore and understand it. You can trust him 110% and his advice is always right on the money. Oh and his English is excellent.I could go on but then I would only be repeating all of the other positive reviews already here.I will however close with this - every time I go to BA I always contact Marcelo and a visit to this city would not be the same without him.It's as simple as this: going to BA and really want to understand the place, then call Marcelo. You will be glad you did and your visit will be all the more memorable for his contribution."

It's a walking tour with some cab rides but we were extremely exhausted after every half day as we covered a lot and the temperature was 100F, Although you can see Buenos Aires on your own, I recommend a private guide. It is more enjoyable and if you have two people, the price isn't so much different than doing a tour. Marcelo covered the main attractions and told us very interesting facts about the history and culture of Argentinians. At the end of the tour, he gave us a binder of great recommendations for restaurants and clubs. We tried 3-4 and the recommendations were spot on! Marcelo also told us how to/where to exchange currency at the unofficial blue rate, which made our USD get us 50% more... Overall, highly recommended and worth every penny. He was fun too :)) We had a great day"

He was always very responsive and informative during the booking process. At our request, he also gave us recommendations of some hotels and things to do during the days he could not be with us since he was already booked.The first day we met in BA, he arrived at the hotel on time and before leaving for the tour we sat down for a few minutes to discuss about the itinerary and to get to know better about our interests. He also gave us a lot of additional information about restaurants, attractions, and etc for the days we would be by ourselves.Marcelo was very easy going, knowledgeable and kept things interesting by giving enough information without making it boring. He is also very flexible in terms of transportation - if you like to walk like we do he will walk with you all day long, but if you prefer taxis, bus, subway, etc, he will also do whatever he can to accommodate.If we ever go back to BA, I will certainly get in touch with Marcelo again. The money was very well spent, specially when compared to other companies/guides I also quoted."

Given our limited time, we wanted to see and learn as much about the city as possible, and this was completely achievable via our time with Marcelo. Even prior to arriving in BA, Marcelo was responsive in his e-mails. He gave plenty of suggestions, answered our hundreds of questions, and really tried to get to know our needs and desires as tourists in his city. He was perfectly candid and honest (which I really liked) in letting us know which neighbourhoods he would help us to understand better historically/culturally-wise, and areas we would be fine exploring on our own (i.e. Puerto Madero, San Telmo), and his fees were completely fair. In one day, he took us to Recoleta, Downtown, La Boca/Caminito, rounding off with the beautiful neighbouhood of Retiro. Among the highlights, we visited the absolutely stunning Recoleta cemetary, the quaint and colourful houses of La Boca, and pretty much all of the city's major historical and political monuments. He showed us that BA really is beautiful city to walk around in, and in one instance of the day, he showed us how to ride the bus like a 'porteno'. Marcelo was extremely knowledgeable in presenting the chronological evolution of BA and how multi-culturally influenced the city really is. We could see from his enthuasiasm how passionate he is about this city. I also loved that he would ask us frequently what we think something represents to keep us engaged (and it was a hot day too!), and constantly tried to help us learn useful spanish words (or different intonations). He was so calm, friendly and unassuming that it was like reuniting with a really good friend. He also took us to a really great restaurant downtown (La Junta) for lunch that wasn't a tourist spot at all. There, we realized that empanadas and pizza really go hand in hand (peas in pod) given BA's italian and spanish influences. Finally, he gave us a bunch of material with restaurant, bar, and milonga recommendations that we could refer to after our time with him. We ended up leveraging two recommendations (Sarkis - restaurant, and Salon Canning - Milonga) and both were absolutely wonderful! BA is a beautiful place, but is only done right with the help and guidance of Marcelo! We would definitely recommend him to all of our friends and family to go with him if they visit Argentina!"

We started our trip off with 1.5 days in Buenos Aires, down to Patagonia, then ended it with 4 full days back in Buenos Aires. I had no idea how to do certain things in the city and frankly, just wanted a local to help me out and show us around.Heard great things about Marcelo, and they weren't wrong! I really wanted to know about where to change money, how to get around the city, and some highlights and history. 4 hours is just not enough time, but we packed in everything I wanted and more. Marcelo met us at our hotel, then we began walking. It was great learning more about the Argentines and people of the city, and swapping knowledge about our 2 countries. At the end of the tour, Marcelo gave my husband and me a folder full of information - places to eat, shop, etc, that we used extensively on our 4 day stay in the city. Excellent recommendations!As for Marcelo himself, he's an enterprising business owner who obviously enjoys what he's doing. He was helpful, humorous, and easy to talk to. It was a nice easy tour, never feeling rushed, and when we wanted a snack, he showed us the best place for ice cream. It was a great thing for me to hand the reins off for a few hours to someone so friendly and capable. If you're going to spend any amount of time in BA, it's a must to hire Marcelo!"

Marcelo will meet you for a wonderful walking tour that highlights all the things Buenos Aires has to offer. Our group of 3 learned more about the architecture, history, politics and food of this wonderful city than we could have ever discovered through any purchased travel guide or preplanned tour. Even TripAdvisor did provide as much interesting and amazing information. The passion Marcelo provided when describing everything from the founders of Argentina to the opera house was infectious and made me want to spend even more time in this city. The additional information he provided when our tour was over was used extensively and I feel it helped us organize our trip to the fullest. Marcelo directed us to some of the best meals of our trip. If you are lucky enough to have a meal with him, just follow his lead and order what he does. When I get back to BA someday, I will certainly plan to spend some additional time with Marcelo. I know there is so much more to learn."

He came recommended to us by another friend who had used his tour guide services a while back. He responded very quickly to our initial contact, and provided invaluable information as we prepared for the trip. He invited us to ask any questions we might have in advance, and again he was very prompt in responding. There is no reason to repeat all the favorable comments that other reviews have outlined in detail. We first met up with him the afternoon of our arrival, and after learning about our individual interests and giving us a brief overview of what he had planned for our first half-day together, off we went. Fortunately, what he had planned for that half-day ran out as our energy did, and we finalized plans to meet up again the next morning for a full day of touring other parts of the city. By the time we were done, between what he showed us, talked about, and advised us about in the written materials he provided, we had absolutely everything we needed to make our trip a great success. Throughout our time with him, he was careful to adjust the pace to make sure we didn't dally, but didn't overextend either. He was very strategic in his use of our time, making sure that we got the maximum benefit from our time with him; even when we needed to stop for lunch or coffee, he used that time to pack in more information that would help us later. Although there were four of us traveling together, he kept us together and was careful to make sure that he spent time talking to each of us. When we parted at the end of the second day, it felt far more like saying farewell to a friend rather than only the end of a tour. Our day-and-a-half was a functional amount of time and, thanks to his advice, we were able to fully enjoy the remainder of our week in Buenos Aires. That said, there were many moments when we wished we still had him along with us--not so much because we felt we needed him, but just because he is who he is. Our bottom line recommendation: hire this delightful, knowledgeable, and talented young man for as much of your stay as you can afford--you won't regret it!"

For our May 2013 trip to Buenos Aires, however, we thought we'd try something different and decided to hire a private tour guide for a few days. After much research, we chose Marcelo based on his incredible TripAdvisor reviews. We also figured that if we're going to try the private-tour-guide option, we might as well do it big. So several months in advance of our trip, we booked Marcelo for four and a half days out of our nine days in Buenos Aires.After receiving the first email from Marcelo, we knew we had found a gem. Every communication from him was helpful, cheerful, and professional. Even though our trip was still months in the future, Marcelo enthusiastically and promptly answered every email we sent him containing various questions about travel to Argentina. By the time our trip had arrived, we were already thinking of Marcelo as our new Argentine buddy, based on our many friendly email exchanges.On our first scheduled day, Marcelo arrived at our rental apartment in Recoleta promptly on time. As we began our first day with him, we soon understood that all of his glowing reviews on TripAdvisor were 100% accurate. Marcelo doesn't just lead you along some route he's predetermined and then regurgitate a bunch of memorized talking points along the way; instead, he helps you figure out where/how you want to explore the city that day and then he joins you in that exploration as an enthusiastic participant, deftly guiding you generally, but otherwise letting you set the pace and tone of the journey. All subsequent days were the same: Marcelo was right on time, in good spirits, and led us on a fantastic tour of the city. Marcelo's knowledge of Buenos Aires and Argentina is extensive, personal, and intellectual. He doesn't just tell you a bunch of facts and figures about what you're seeing. Instead, he wants you to understand what you're seeing within the cultural, political, and historical context of the city, region, country, and continent. Marcelo tells the story of what you're seeing in a concise, yet deeper and richer way than any guidebook or corporate tour ever could. Marcelo is passionate about his city and country, and it's infectious. Marcelo is also one of those rare people that, five minutes after you've met him for the first time, you feel like you've known him for years and that you're hanging out with your best friend. To conclude, we can only echo what all of the previous TA reviewers have said about Marcelo: he's knowledgeable, helpful, prompt, professional, interesting, trustworthy, and charming. Marcelo is not just the best personal tour guide in Buenos Aires; he's also an exceptional human being. Our only regrets are: 1.) we didn't hire him for a few more days and, 2.) we couldn't bring him home with us!"

We met with Marcelo, at our hotel ahead of the tour, where we explained our interests and objectives for the day. He then detailed where he planned to take us and provided a verbal itinerary... we agreed and set off on foot.The tour Marcelo provided was fantastic! He showed us spots in BA we would never have found on our own and provided fascinating insights into each hi-lite. His knowledge of Argentinian history, politics and society are next to none. His commentary, english and tour pace were excellent! At the end of his tour day he provided great tips on other sightseeing and activity we could do on our own while in BA. We followed his advice and had an amazing 2 days afterwards... thanks Marcelo!We are avid world travelers from Canada and by far this tour ranks among the best we have ever taken anywhere in the world. I was sorry the tour had to end and we could not have continued traveling with Marcelo. Marcelo is a master at his job and we highly recommend him for your touring needs in BA."

It is a walking-taxis-bus tour covering the city. Marcelo provides private tours based on your choices and his recommendations of what to see in the time-frame and pace you set. He was most accommodating with every aspect from planning to providing wonderful suggestions for dining and entertainment. In addition to his in-depth knowledge of the city and history, he has a most enjoyable personality and a wonderful sense-of-humor. It was like touring with your best friend taking care of everything! The tour was informative, relaxed, interactive and just a wonderful time spent in BA. I can't wait to return soon! I highly recommend Marcelo!"

He is simply a very likable person. I think that people from all countries, and all ages, will get along with Marcelo well. If he is available, you should not hesitate to hire him immediately. Spending time with him in BA was the best decision. Not only did I truly enjoy his company, but I learned so much about Buenos Aires and Argentina.He takes pride in providing his guide services and enjoys telling the fascinating history and background of each area. I was so happy to have him there to teach me, rather than me trying to read it all from a travel book, or be on group tour. He makes the day fun and interesting and will pace his guide services to whatever you prefer. I told him that I wanted to see it all...and we walked, took taxis, and the subway, and after three long and wonderful days, we accomplished all that I wanted to see! He never tires and is always charming and in a good mood- no matter the heat, the length of day, or any of my requests. As he has traveled a lot, he understands other cultures and he speaks perfect English. Every moment I spent with him was an absolute delight. I truly consider him a friend."

Traveling with Marcelo was like spending time with a good friend. He truly cared about us, which made this a much more pleasant experience than we have ever had (or expected) with your typical tour guide.Marcelo was recommended to me by my travel agent, who raved about his tours at an affordable price (quality and affordability are very important to me). He thought my family and I would have a more enjoyable experience in Buenos Aires with Marcelo\u2019s assistance, and was he ever right.From his first email to our good-bye after 2 days together, I found Marcelo to be professional, personable and extremely customer-focused, with a great sense of humor. He doesn\u2019t have a canned tour. Fluent in English, Marcelo customized each of our days to accommodate two 40+ adults and a 78-year old senior citizen (three people who don\u2019t speak the language, brought a variety of interests, personalities and never-ending questions). He was totally flexible and unflappable. Marcelo is quite knowledgeable of Argentinean history, and current events both in Buenos Aires and the US. Well-traveled himself, he has interesting and well-thought out perspectives of culture, politics and people in general. I wish we had more time with Marcelo, but after 2 days, we had a firm grounding on Buenos Aires, and knew exactly what we wanted to do in our remaining few days. He set us up for success!I see another trip to Buenos Aires in our future. With Marcelo\u2019s wonderful assistance, I look forward to exploring locations outside of the city. I know that he\u2019ll always make the adventures interesting, fun and memorable.Sharon Lewis"

Some guides just go through the motions, having done the same tour a thousand times. Not Marcelo. Within a short time of meeting Marcelo, we felt like we had a friend showing us around town. We spent two days with Marcelo. We learned far more about Argentina and the city, politics, culture, economics, you name it, than just the various sites we went to. And of course, we got a great tour of the city too. Even a few unusual finds that others I have spoken to have never seen. I highly recommend spending two days. We were able to do things at a leisurely pace, take some breaks and spend time at cafes and other places with Marcelo and, as I said, felt like we were with a friend enjoying the city. Marcelo was also very very helpful even before we arrived in Buenos Aries, giving us information and tips. And when we finished up with him he gave us a package with a map and various recommendations for places to eat and other things to do. Also, I felt his fee was very reasonable, in comparison to what i have spent in other cities around the world for a private guide (no transportation. you walk or take taxi's with him)"

My colleague and I had a business meeting in Rosario then a full-day layover in Buenos Aires on the way home. Our meeting timing left little time to explore and we wanted to get a feel for Argentina (to the extent possible in one day) before we left. I found Marcelo\u2019s services via TripAdvisor, and contacted him by e-mail to set up our tour. He responded promptly; his initial message was very helpful, and he adjusted the tour schedule to fit the time that we had available (about 5.5 hours). Marcelo was very accommodating with respect to our needs (washrooms, food, drink etc.) as he toured us to the important historical, political and social sites within Buenos Aires, as well as (at our request) shops where we could find some souvenirs of our trip. He blended the site visits with an engaging commentary on the social, political and economic fabric of the country. Marcelo is well-spoken and informative, with a clear passion for Argentina, Buenos Aires and Portenos \u2013 of which he is one. I would not hesitate to use his services again or recommend him to friends and colleagues. Simply great!"

We wanted to visit places and do things that would give us more the \"feel\" of what make Buenos Aires unique. Marcelo came through in a big way. We watched a tango matinee at a local milonga full of character watching portenos dance. We had the best pizza and empanadas in the history of the world at a local hangout that has been in business for decades. We visited a street fair in San Telmo and stopped in a little coffee shop, a favorite of Marcelo's ( and, again decades old).

He allowed us time to do what we wanted to see, in our case the wonderful Museo Fortabat, but he gently suggested (correctly) that we would be far better off spending some time with him in Retiro instead of La Boca.Marcelo has also compiled his own recommended list of restaurants, clubs & attractions which he gave us in order for us to do our exploring on our own.On our last night in BA we visited an iconic Milonga, La Confiteria Ideal, (at the top of his list) & spent over 3 hours mesmerized by the Tango dancers, both amateur and expert, and inspired by the sensual and arousing live music. We were still humming \"Por Una Cabeza\" into the wee small hours!Marcelo - muchas gracias y bien hecho"

And that's what I love about Marcelo (he's also endearing, but that's not the point).

There was so much more than just visiting the different sights, there was so much knowledge about the city and the history of the country to accompany this which made for a really interesting day, but still fun at the same time as Marcelo has a lovely warm manner about him.This is a fantastic way to see Buenos Aires, I am so glad that I chose Marcelo and would not hesitate to recommend."

Marcello's English is excellent, He is intelligent, organized, flexible, accommodating and also a very nice person! His knowledge of the history and culture of Buenos Aires is amazing and enhanced our trip. He also observed our family and modified the itinerary, with our consent, based upon what he thought we would enjoy most, and he was right. We highly recommend hiring him as your tour guide on your trip to Buenos Aires."

His pride in his country and city is obvious and has motivated him to learn and to make sure you understand the complex history that has created Buenos Aires. He is also charming and was willing to conduct the tour in measured and carefully enunciated Spanish so that I could practice my comprehension. I will continue to recommend Marcelo to anyone I know that is visiting BA, but reserve early -- he is popular for a good reason."

In terms of history, he doesn't bog you down with tons of dates and facts, but instead gives you the most important pieces of information so that you remember it and share it later with other friends. He answered our questions honestly. The half day flew by and by the end we felt we had a friend. All four of us afterwards talked about how happy we were to do this, and how pleased we were with Marcelo.If you are visiting BA, book a tour with Marcelo - you will not be disappointed!!"

We had the pleasure of meeting and touring with Marcelo on September 3rd, 2011 for a private half-day tour. We are so very glad that we did. We\u2019ve taken many tours in our travels, (including a few in Buenos Aires) - I think Marcelo was by far the best storyteller of the lot. He has a college degree in tourism and it shows. Marcello offers a great mix of anecdote, statistic, and historical fact-- setting a rich background and the context for each of his tales and each of the landmarks he points out. His stories were riveting, whether about the Mothers (and Grandmothers) of May Plaza or about the tragic Falklands War. Throughout our time I was truly impressed at his eye for interesting detail. In just a half day we covered a great deal of the city center by foot \u2013 and Marcelo was always quick to point out locations that we might enjoy returning to on our own. (We particularly loved his recommendation of the Confiteria Ideal.) At the end of our tour Marcelo sat with us for some time with the city map \u2013 pointing out areas and streets of interest. He then provided a whole printed folder containing wealth of activities, directions and restaurant recommendations. He was like a tour guide and travel concierge all in one! We want to thank Marcelo for such a perfect BA afternoon."

His style is a bit different from other guides, he does not rush so you can see 100 attractions in a day. He prefers to take a little more time, and give you the background, the history, the flavor and the culture. He will completely tailor your tour based on your preference. But my friends and I decided to let him choose, which worked out great. We did a 4 hour tour; and liked it enough to have a second day with another 4 hour tour. Each 4 hour tour was $80 USD for our small group. Mainly we did a lot of walking, but also took a couple of taxis. Marcelo also makes sure you are \"set\" for your entire stay, he gladly shares tons of ideas for places to go, his favorite restaurants, tango shows, or whatever you'd like to see. Thanks Marcelo!"

We contacted him after seeing his glowing reviews on here and he surpassed our expectations.I emailed him and replied very quickly with all of his information and what he could do for us. Before we got to BA we had already organised a tango show to see after reading the options for shows that Marcello told me about. (we decided to go to a hour long show at the cafe tortoni which was very fun and good value for money). He then helped us pay for it when we got there as he cleverly fit it in to our tour. He, of course, charged us nothing for this.He met us at our hotel and discussed with us what we wanted to do and then we set off! We wanted to know about the history about BA and some good spots to visit the next day we were there. He showed us a lot in 4 hours and the highlight was seeing the cemetery which he was very knowlodgeable about and told us very interesting stories about the different graves. Over lunch he gave us a map and a list of places/restaurants/safety information that we might need and told us need. And because me and mum had mentioned wine and food several times (!) we discussed the best restraunts to go to in more detail. It was great that he helped us plan the next day as we wouldn't of known what to do - and he wasn't pushy at all and didn't insist that we saw anything in particular.We paid him $80 USD for four hours but he was happy to stay for an hour longer free of charge but we paid him for it anyway as he was excellent and well worth the money.I have already suggested him to a few friends and the same recommendation goes to you!And lastly....THANK YOU MARCELLO!!! :D xxI just wanted to email you and say thank you so so so so much for all of your help whilst we were in BA and for helping us organise everything before while we were still in the UK. You were so fast at replying! I have given your details to three of the cabin crew which will be coming back in the next year or so. Your knowlodge of your city and history of it was excellent and I am very glad to have learnt about it (May 21st, 1810!!).We had an excellent time at the tango you organised for us and the next day was great as the itenery your helped us make took us to the best places which we throughly enjoyed! The market was great and I bought a cow skin rug for my living room! It was 600 pesos but in engald it would cost at least \u00a3200 (1800 or so pesos!!) so I was very very happy! We also found some good wine in the super market and so I am delighted with my souvenires! But most importantly are the memories...and my favourite part was the cematary with you tour and the facinating stories you told us, so thank you Marcello."

To call him a tour guide, is to greatly under-rate the quality of his services. Taking a tour around Buenos Aires with Marcelo is like having your best friend show you around his hometown. Marcelo is extremely knowledgeable (as would be expected of any guide), so what makes him stand out from other guides, is his true passion for his city, his sense of humour and his keen interest in you and how this translates into a tour that is tailored to your personality and interests. Beyond the tours, Marcelo provides excellent recommendations (including for accommodation, entertainment and wining/dining) and is more than happy to assist with any additional queries you may have, before and after the tour.

Literally within half and hour of writing I received an answer and over several conversations these guys were able to present me with options for my time frame and my taste in tours. Penelope with whom I was chatting even suggested a rather exquisite Perfume House to me after noticing my email address which alludes to the fact I am connected to Perfume. I was very impressed with the suggestion. The Oerfume House is top class BTW. It's so hard sometimes to get part of the job right and in fact this part for me, is the most important . 10/10 Buenos Aires Local Tours. You've nailed customer service!"

As someone who was brand new to South America and coming from the US, I was excited to see the city but had read things that worried me ('blue dollar' exchanges, fake money, pickpockets, etc). When we took the tour with Ceri, he put those fears to rest by teaching us some basic street smarts and giving us a sense of the city's vibe. We learned how to spot fake money, got around on the subway, and took quick trips to many different sites and neighborhoods - sort of like a 'sampler platter' of things to do. Ceri was also able to answer any question thrown at him, whether it was places to eat or where the great day trips outside the city are. I went by myself, but there were plenty of couples and a cruise ship group along with us, and we made a fun group. No matter what your plans are, spending a half day on this tour will make you much more comfortable in the city, give you new ideas, and answer any questions so you can really dive in. Plus, with it being 'pay what you want', the value is through the roof!Go for it. Highly recommended."

There were only 6 of us on the tour and we met Ceri at Puerto Rico Cafe in the city center. While we had a bite to eat Ceri gave us all sorts of useful information on how to enjoy and navigate the city. That alone was very helpful but the best was yet to come. For the next three hours Ceri showed us some of the highlights of Buenos Aires history, architecture, culture and off the tourist route dining on foot and via the Subte. He even helped one couple to exchange money on Calla Florida. This was worth the going of other walking tours plus a tip, which, in November of 2015, came to around $40.00.

You can expect a friendly, funny, and knowledgeable tour guide who will show you around and give you advice on money exchange, restaurants, and tango places, as well empart his knowledge on the important historical events of the country. But what you wouldn't expect from a tour guide is for him to go out of his way to help you out in a luggage situation at the airport, which is what Ceri did for us, and it was greatly appreciated. His philosophy on how to treat people was spot on and because we followed his advice to be friendly and respectful to the people we met, we found the Porte\u00f1os to be very genuine and friendly. I will definitely take another tour with Ceri if I get the chance to return to BsAs some day."

Returning to Buenos Aires for another short visit, on my way to Ushuaia, meant that I had already visited most of the key tourist spots so I was looking to do something different this time. I had failed to visit La Boca on previous visits and a custom tour with a local guide seemed the ideal opportunity to have a more in depth exploration of the area and get off the beaten track without getting into trouble. On explaining what I was looking for, a photography focused custom tour involving the La Boca district, I was told that it would be no problem as they had a professional photographer (Richard) on staff and he conducted photography tours plus he was available on the only day I had to spare. As I wasn\u2019t sure if jet lag would be a problem I arranged for a five hour afternoon tour of La Boca and left it to Richard to organise the details.After meeting at Fundacion Proa we brushed shoulders with the tourists at the \u201csights\u201d before heading off into the actual neighbourhood where we didn\u2019t see another tourist and finding the real gems, such as the La Boca volunteer fire department where we were invited into the station to have a look around and talk to the fire fighters, and then to an interesting local market for a refreshment stop before having an amusing encounter with some street performers. All in all a pleasant afternoon having fun with a great guide and highly recommended."

They are the best local tour group I\u2019ve interacted with on this trip. My contacts - Penelope and Jonathan - had excellent written English skills, responded to my e-mailed questions thoroughly, and always followed-up. Buenos Aires is a big city with many attractions and activities. The initial information Penelope e-mailed helped me get around and plan my time wisely to experience the parts of the city of most interest.The city tour with Ceri was fantastic \u2013 so much information and we went to parts of the Buenos Aires removed from the normal tourist crowd. Ceri was fun and his commentary was educational and helpful in understanding Buenos Aires, one of my favorite cities. The tour was thoroughly enjoyable!I recommend Buenos Aires Tours to anyone visiting the city, especially for the first time.

I thought the walking tour would give a good overview of the city and hit the highlights, which was all we had time for. This worked out well for us. This company offers free walking tours where you pay in tips what you feel is appropriate. You do need to sign up ahead of time on-line so they have a head count. This helps to keep the groups small. You will receive a follow-up e-mail with the name and photo of the meeting point, as well as the name and photo of your guide. We landed in Buenos Aires at 4:30 am on a Monday and after a quick rest we were able to locate the Puerto Rico Cafe described in the e-mail. Our guide, Ceri, is a Canadian/UK transplant who has lived in BA for 7 years. He took our group of about a dozen people on a tour of Plaza de Mayo, where he gave historical background near the Pink House, famous for the balcony used by Evita Peron. We saw the cathedral and went back in later on our own--beautiful and worth doing! Outside does not look like much but the inside was very European-cathedral looking.Ceri's tours focus on making you feel comfortable with BA, so he took us on a bus and subway. He also took us to change money at a street newstand, where you get a better exchange rate. I have to say that was kind of creepy, though--seemed like we were doing something underhanded behind a curtain. Anyway, all was fine. Ceri was very entertaining and we enjoyed the experience. We finished up near the kiosk about 1:45 pm.I will say we did not see a LOT of BA on this tour, as this company's focus is helping you feel comfortable navigating public transportation, etc. We went on a different walking tour the next day (see separate entry) where we saw more of the city. Both have their positives and negatives.If you have time, this is a pleasant way to spend a morning."

We also took the bus and subway to get some more local flavor. Ceri took us to his favorite wine shop, to a money changer, and gave us other good, helpful advice. His personality was engaging, his knowledge, vast and we all enjoyed the tour and learned a lot. If there was a downside, it was that he dwelled too much on the safety issue. I would definitely recommend this tour."

We met Quincy as arranged by email in one of the old cafes in the centre of the city and she guided the small group of 4 around the traditional tourist sights in the centre of the city with lots of interesting details about the history and then took us by bus to Abasto to see some of the sites associated with the origin of the tango and the old market hall (now a shopping mall!), returning to the city centre by the subway. From the US by birth, she conveyed her love of the city and gave lots of useful tips for making the most of our time there. As we had not had an opportunity to change money before the tour she even paid our fares on the bus and subway, and explained how and where to change money with the best exchange rate. There was absolutely no pressure to pay any fixed amount for the tour, and literally it was 'Pay what you want' - Quincy did not even remind me I owed her for the fares! I would highly recommend this tour for anyone at the start of a visit to Buenos Aires."

We are from Seattle and this was the first time the young lad had been out of the country - we took a 1/2 day walking tour on our first morning in BA. We were grouped up with some very nice people - a solo Australian and a young couple that were circumnavigating the globe.I've been on plenty of tours in various parts of the world and this I have to say was my favorite. We met Ceri, and the others, and had a very casual trip through a few different areas of the city. Ceri knew his history and presented it in perfect bite size pieces. This was by far our favorite daytime activity of the whole trip. Our group had such a good time that all of us, along with Ceri, went out for lunch together.Well done Ceri, see you next time I'm in BA.Bob"

First, let me say that we got a very prompt response to our request on their website, and they continued to respond very quickly to our follow up emails. We met at a coffee shop downtown in the morning. He started with a half hour briefing on the city in general and he provided some very useful safety tips. Many of them are usual common sense when one travels in a foreign city, but many were specific to the area and were very helpful. The group was fairly large that morning, with a few extras showing up, so we did not take the bus or the subway. We did walk around Plaza de Mayo and down toward Congress, and he showed us some very special buildings we would not have known on our own. We stopped for a money changer which we did not need, but if anyone needs to change money here, it's best to have some recommendation.We got lots of little details and some interesting insights into the customs and history. All in all, it was a morning very well spent. We recommend it highly for anyone who plans to spend a few days (we are here for a whole month) and who wants to be able to get around the city on their own.Great job and many thanks!!!"

Our tour was at a nice easy pace, with stops for coffee, the pharmacy, money changer and more. He was very knowledgeable. He recommended La Brigada for lunch at San Telmos. We were a bit skeptical because the neighborhood didn't seem very appealing. We were not disappointed, the steak melts in your mouth. The best we've ever had. Also the wine he recommended, was beautiful. We saw so much, learnt so much and had a great time. We felt safe and well looked after. If you are deciding on a walking tour, don't hesitate.

Our 3 hour tour allowed us to visit Cafe Tortoni, learned about the history of Casa Rosada and visit Basilica del Santisimo Sacramento.

Oliver grew up in California and we're from the US so communication was not a problem. He met us at the port and took us to get cabs where they don't charge the inflated rate at the port. We walked the streets of La Boca while Oliver talked about football, early immigrants and the Tango. From there we caught a bus to San Telmo where we saw an entirely different type of neighborhood. He found us a great place for lunch where we had pizza unlike what we get in the states. From there we went to Plaza de Mayo where Oliver talked about the pope, Evita and the 20th century politics of Argentina. The next day we met Oliver at one of our hotels and took cabs to the Abasto neighborhood where we saw and heard about Carlos Gardel, the father of Tango. We then took a subway to Plaza San Martin and saw the mansions of the wealthy at the beginning of the 20th century. He took us to an empanada restaurant for lunch. We finished the day at the Recoleta cemetery where Oliver told us at least a dozen stories about people buried there including Evita. It was a lot of walking but a great way to see the city. I never would have tried the subway without a tour guide. Oliver is very engaging, extremely knowledgable and a great story teller. I highly recommend him."

Ceri, our tour guide, is a professional at caring for his city and his people. As he says \"I treat you as I want to be toured\" and he does not disappoint. The only disappointment is when it is over. We plan on signing up with him again this week because he personalizes each and every tour - You learn practical information to be safe, you learn reasonable places to see Tango, you learn history, you laugh, you truly have a great time with Ceri.

Fast reply on the email, very friendly text and with a designated guide (Ceri) and lots of recommendations of what to see in the city, incl links to other sites. We met our guide at 10am, and were happy to see that our group consisted of only 4 people! Almost like a private tour, and our guide, Ceri, let us take part in the decision where to go/what to see. Ceri has lots of knowledge of both Buenos Aires and Argentina - history, architecture, policy, economy, etc, and we learned a lot in 3-4 hours. We wandered around in the city centre, but also went with the underground and the bus to other neighbourhoods.

Useful intel - the bus system is not that easy to navigate but Ceri equipped us with the know how to use it, and the Subte, simply. Social, political & economic content- we could schlep around the key sights ourselves but having someone bring them to life with relevant content & context made it far more valuable. Unusual/unseen gems - BA is a big place & you don't always get time to gawp at the less obvious bits. Having someone lead you to (and inside) stunning buildings is a big advantageCan't recommend enough"

Jess was a great guide and we learned so much about how to get around the city on public transport (incredibly cheap) as well as seeing some things that I doubt we ever would have without her. By the time the tour was over we had a really good idea of what else we should see in BA as well as how best to get there. The Masters golf was on while we were there and during our tour someone asked which bars might be showing it on tv. Jess wasn't sure but by the time we got back to the hotel there was an e mail waiting for us telling where we could see it. She also left us contact details for if we had any other queries whilst out n about in the city ( which, by the way, we loved). She didn't have to do either of these things but just seemed to genuinely love this city and wanted us to enjoy it too. So, go on, take the tour ( which is free, you just pay what you think when it's over) and don't be stingy with the cash at the end!!"

We started near Palermo and took both the bus and Subte all over town which was a good introduction to the city's transport. Stopping for lunch in Abasto we then went on to see some of the most beautiful and historically important sights in Buenos Aires, ending at the Casa Rosada in Plaza de Mayo. Oliver was charming and full of knowledge throughout the tour, and being an actor he had very clear diction and lots of humour in his delivery. I imagine this is why his tour is very popular with private group tours too. I would highly recommend you take his tour as an introduction to this amazing city."

The tour of the cemetery was full of fun, interesting information and going with a guide included the added benefit of not getting lost! After our tour, we went to Plaza Italia for the regularly scheduled tour - our group was a manageable size (7) and Johnathan gave a great explanation of how to use the bus system as well as how to navigate the Subte safely. The tour covers the major historical sites in central BA as well as Abasto - an area we would have been unlikely to find/visit on our own. Post-tour he gave us helpful info on visiting San Telmo/La Boca on our own as well as sending out a post tour email full of restaurant and Tango suggestions. Overall, it was a great way to start our visit to the city and help get ourselves oriented in Buenos Aires."

Jonathan shows you a lot of the major Buenos Aires sites, and explains the history and context quite well. The most unique and helpful thing that he does is teach you how to navigate the Buenos Aires bus system, which without his guidance is very confusing at best. And he explains it quite well. I'd recommend doing this on one of your first days. It will give you context for the rest of the sites you see through your trip, and will help you get around the city!"

(I'd even recommend coming to BA just for his tour.) :-) He is knowledgeable, witty, clearly professional in leading a group through some of the complications of the bus system (his IT background helps, I think), and the subte. At the end of the \"free tour\" ( I agree with others - tip him as much as you can afford), he continued with our group on a private tour (previously arranged by a couple who were on the free tour) for two more hours. Even though BA was suffering a heat wave, he was as fresh at the end of the day as at the start. Even helped me with directions back to my Airbnb apartment as he was going on the same bus line. Thank you Jonathan!"

He waited at Plaza Italia, sitting on the steps next to the statue with a small sign next to him. Pay attention in the beginning as he will explain the public transport system to you, which is just immensely valuable for your stay in Buenos Aires. Jonathan took us to a lot of interesting sites around the city, being able to provide lots of information at every stop. This is definitely a tour worth doing! Be sure to tip him at the end, as he does make his living doing these tours. You don't have to worry about bringing lunch, as you'll be making a lunch stop at Abasto Shopping Center in the middle of the tour."

The day starts 11am (still get to sleep in) at the Italian square meeting point which is very centrally located to most of the popular areas. You meet Jonathan and he explains the day and most importantly the essentials of the public transport system: Bus (Which in BA can be complex unless someone explains it to you) and metro (pretty straight forward if you have used other metro around the world).Sites: Jonathan first took us to the area where Carlos Gardel lived and now is a museum dedicated to him. You then have lunch at the oldest meat market in BA which is now a beautiful air con shopping centre but the building has been kept the same. You then head to see more popular buildings but most importantly for me was the Pink house where Evita famously sung to her people.As mentioned on previous post there is no pressure from Jonathan to tip and he is very informative of the history of BA and answers all questions.I highly recommend doing the tour on your first day as it teaches you the basics of the city."

During the tour he gives lots of back stories about the places you are seeing and leaves you with plenty of ideas for places to back and see more in depth later. While you are walking around you have plenty of time to talk to the other tourists (10 in our group) and the guide to find out what he and they recommend.It was very hot during our tour and Jonathan made sure to keep to the shade and offer water breaks when they were needed. It's a small thing you want to expect, but don't always get. He also will send an email with recommendations for restaurants, tango shows, day trips, etc after the tour. Definitely a 5 star free walking tour, make 4 hours to head out and learn about Buenos Aires soon after your arrival."

We went to an area that we couldn't have gone to on our own - but gained an understanding of Carlos Gardel, Tango in BA, and street art in BA. And very much enjoyed ourselves!! The tour is relaxed, very casual - our group was around 10, very friendly, and Jonathan escorted us efficiently through the city. Our tour was 4 1/2 hours. There was a lunch break half way through with a bathroom break. We found Jonathan right away - it was nice to meet in Palermo since that is where we were staying. We ended downtown near the Casa Rosada - which was an easy place to continue to venture around the city for a few more hours. Only complaint - wish there was a little more walking down the Calle de Mayo rather than taking the subway 2x! Jonathan sent out a helpful email after the tour with good restaurants to eat at, Tango shows to attend, and other tours to take.Highly recommend!!"

Jonathan has a great sense of humour, provides extremely helpful tips for staying in BA, and has chosen a route that gives a good introductory feel for the city. We loved the Abasto section which we wouldn't have seen had we not taken the tour, and the guide's ability to summarise a lot of the city's history in an interesting and succinct way is quite impressive. We were part of a large group of people from all age groups, and despite having to herd us on to a very busy bus and two very busy trains Jonathan was patient and helpful at all times. We would have liked to have seen a little more during the 4 hours but overall I would really recommend this free tour."

In the short space of the free tour Jonathan shared insights and history for BA that were extremely interesting and useful to my travel companions and I. He also educated us on the practicalities of using the somewhat complex bus, subway and train system here and freely shared his knowledge of additional interesting locations we then visited in our spare time, such as about Tigre. We saw several of the major attractions in the free tour along with history and stories we wouldn't have known otherwise. We ended up also booking him for a guided tour of Recoleta Cemetary and the area and would have booked more if we'd had the time. We highly recommend the free tour and also booking Jonathan to show you around additional parts of the city!"

No matter if your stay here is going to be short or long - take the tour and you either get nice idea where you wanna have a closer look next days, or, if you are leaving soon, you get a nice overview of the most important landmarks. Jonathan is a great guide, you will get tons of information about Buenos Aires and Argentina, their history, culture, politics, ... and also great practical hints!

When only 2 other tourists showed up for the tour we were fearful he might cancel but we were not disappointed. In fact, our tour was even more personal because of the small size. Jonathan patiently answered all of our questions. He also followed up with excellent recommendations and suggestions afterwards that were tailored specifically to us after he had gotten to know us throughout the day. I especially liked the stop at Carlos Gardel's house and lunch in Abasto. Who knew? I would have felt like such an idiot if I returned to the US without knowing about Carlos Gardel. Jonathan's patient advice on how to use the Buenos Aires metro and bus was especially useful for anyone planning on spending more than a few days in BA. An excellent tour."

I can promise you will not be disappointed with his service as it goes way beyond the call of duty (yes he does email really quickly, gives a list of things to do after the visit and you can always use him for more questions at a later stage during your trip.) He was so good that we did another private tour of the boca area. Once again without having read tons on the area, he gave us a mini history class in the space of 1.5 hours! Priceless really!!!

I was staying in Palermo Soho, and even though I am a really good walker, it was just too far to walk all the time from my hotel. This tour gives you the skills and the confidence to use public transit in Buenos Aires, primarily the subway. While it is not as nice as the subway in other cities, is a very efficient way to get around. Another benefit of the tour is you learn quite a bit about the city, and it give you much more context for your visit. I enjoyed seeing the Abasto neightborhood, and its colorful murals and art deco shopping center. I doubt I would have seen this on my own. I also liked the fact that the tour ended at the Plaza de Mayo. Since it was a Thursday afternoon, I got to the see the Madres demonstration, which was one of the most moving sights I saw in Buenos Aires. Jonathan was a great guide. The only thing I would improve on the tour is to skip the last subway ride, which was very short and walk down Ave de Mayo instead. Otherwise it was perfect and highly recommend."

Jonathan was a great tour guide, not only did he have great knowledge of Buenos Aires, he took the time to explain all there is to know about previous events in Argentina that had an affect on the Federal Capital. He was informative and approachable about any questions that we asked about the area. We would definitely say this is a must do, as you will know so much about the city after its finished."

This walking tour is definitely the one I would suggest going on. Jonathan has lived in BA for years now, and knows his stuff. He is English so can communicate with English speakers, but knows his Spanish too. The tour hit the hotspots of BA and any question you have is answered knowledgeably. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour, and learning about how to get around on the weird bus system. You get a chance for lunch in a fancy art deco mall, and end up in the main plaza of Centro. Great walking tour, you will learn a lot, be entertained and the tour will over run if you want to find out more."

Besides, taking us to various sites, he taught us how to take the buses and subway, which is so useful since the sites in ba are pretty dispersed.

He was really knowledgeable about not only the cemetery, but also gave some great advice on getting around on buses and the metro and even food options. Definitely recommend if you visit BA!"

Your visit will be much enhanced. I almost forgot to mention that during this 4 hour tour you go all over town and see many interesting sites and get a lot of interesting facts and history especially regarding Carlos Gardel and Gauchito Gil whom I have never heard of until the tour. He also spoke about the Peron\u2019s, Evita and her husband Juan the former Argentinian President, who had a huge historical impact on BA."

It was done on May 7 and May is considered low season. We were four tourists, 3 from Canada and one from France. Our tour guide is Jonathan, an Englishman who has lived in Buenos Aires for several years. He started by explaining how the bus system works. He showed a map showing the bus routes and how to read it. This can be purchased in any magazine kiosk for about AD$10. Very helpful if you plan to use the bus to get around the city. Bus ride is about AD$3.00 for any distance you travel. He also showed how to use the subte (subway). This is even cheaper than the bus, charging only AD$2.50 per ride.Jonathan showed us some landmarks with accompanying anecdotes. They were very amusing. He gave us some insight on the culture and mores of the people. He was very patient in explaining things and spent more time than the usual 4 hours. We saw places and buildings that we wouldn't have known in our short stay in Buenos Aires. This tour is one of the highlights of our trip. Worth taking. A generous tip is also much appreciated."

We met Jonathan for the Saturday tour and were amazed all the things we learned in saw in such a short amount of time. We enjoyed the tour so much on Saturday with the group that we hired Jonathan for Sunday to show us around Recoleta, La Boca, and San Telmo. Wow! Best money I have ever spent. Walking through Recoleta is a must for any visitor, but what makes it better is having someone to share the history, explain the key tombs, and guide you through the cemetary. Then, the trip to La Boca was certainly much easier with a guide to ensure you navigate in and out of the area without issue. If you are only in the city for a few days, make sure you leverage Jonathan for the private tour. You won't be disappointed."

Coming off of two non stop days of flights and touring we didnt want to stress ourselves out too much in Buenos Aires so there was no tour or itinerary for stay there. A day before the tour I saw it in tripadvisor cities (excellent iphone app btw). I'm sure they do these kinds of tours all the time but i'm not really big on tours and tour guides so to hear of a 'free' tour was something new to me. Arrived a few minutes late to meet up location where Jonathon was awaiting us. I expected there to be more people but fortunately for us it was just us. I asked Jonathan and he said his tours can be anywhere from 2-20 people i believe with the average being around 10. This is key to note that everyone's tour can be vastly different from the others. In some aspects Jonathan remained very professional and composed which is good in a sense because it reminds you that you ARE on a tour. However, there were aspects that didnt feel pre-rehearsed or forced. These were my favourite parts because thats when it didnt feel like a tour, but justa friend walking me around an unfamiliar city. My only criticism, if any, would be for the tour to be a little bit more like this unstructured, but i understand the restraints and why this cant always be so.That being said we did diverge from the regular tour and went to Recoleta Cemetry. We also got to see the only Kosher Mcdonalds and house of Carlos Gardel. Jonathan was able to answer every question we threw at him, although i dont think we are the most inquisitve people. He def. knows his geography and knowledge. All in all, if you have 4 hours to spare then there isnt any reason not to go on this tour and get a more local experience of BA. Also remember tip well as its a 'free' tour!"

We took Jonathan's tour of Buenos Aires after we had been in the city for a week, but it's best to show up on the first or 2nd day of your visit. This is an excellent way to learn more about the culture, history and soul of the city. His commentary is full of dry humor and well informed observations about the ways of the people. You can reach Jonathan via e-mail. The tour begins most days at 11 am. Among the highlights is Jonathan's fine description of the origins of tango which includes a visit to the neighborhood where Carlos Gardel lived."

We would recommend doing the tour early in your stay as it really helps you to adjust to the city, what to expect and how to get from one place to another. We probably wouldn't have taken the subte by ourselves without having been shown the way, now we will take it, at least back to Plaza de Mayo area if no other area. We have traveled a fair bit and found Jonathon to be friendly, outgoing, helpful and willing to answer questions with a great personality and we enjoyed ourselves. As mentioned there is no fee for taking the tour but this is how he makes his living and appreciates the tips."

He was just as good as the other reviewers have portrayed. Interesting, engaging, fun and best of all, a native English speaker. One of the best memories of the day was when Jonathon attempted to explain the incomprehensible bus system. His conclusion was that if you found it necessary to make sense of the illogical system, then Buenos Aires was not for you! We enjoyed our tour, our trip to BA and we simply took the subways and not the buses!"

            "review": "Get around like a local. After reading the reviews for Jonathan's tour, I decided to book the tour for 18 January. Once the group assembled at Plaza Italia, Jonathan explained that we'd be using local transportation to get around the city. He also explained how to decipher the \"Guida T\" (bus guide) to find a proper bus route and that the buses only take coins. I suffered a brief panic when I realized I had no coins; however, Jonathan quickly relieved the panic by offering to exchange paper for coins.Once everyone in the group had the proper coinage our tour commenced by queueing for the bus (the locals are very serious about queueing) and subsequently riding the bus to the home of the face of Tango -- Carlos Gardel -- in the Abasto district. After learning about Carlos and his various exploits we had a short break for lunch at the Abasto indoor shopping mall, formerly the Buenos Aires central market.From there we traveled by subway to congressional plaza. The trip didn't require coins since there were attendants on hand to make change. After learning about Kilometer Zero and other Buenos Aires history we walked down Avienda de Mayo (pronounced \"MAH sho\" Jonathan explained) to Casa Rosada, the offices of the executive branch of the Argentinian government. Along the way we passed several points of interest, including a reference to Dante's Inferno, Cafe Tortoni, and ultimately the symbols of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo.For anyone wanting to know how to get around Buenos Aires like a local and absorbing some Argentinian history along the way, one would be well informed by taking this tour.A few hints if you take the tour:* Have $2 and $1 pesos on hand for the bus* If you must carry a bag, carry an old one.* If you carry a bag, keep it in front of you when riding public transit.* I never felt unsafe while on the tour, but be vigilant. As Jonathan told us: \"a little paranoia goes a long way\""

Definitely the best way to experience a city is to hang out with a local, albeit an adopted one, so your sightseeing isn't aimless. There is too much to do and learn in Buenos Aires to go into it with no clue, and the Congreso means so much more when you also get to hear the story of the over the top windmill cafe next to it. He was also extremely patient with my irritating shutterbug habit. If you do only one thing in Buenos Aires on your visit here, make sure this is it. Thanks again so much Jonathan!!!"

It's the first walking tour we've done that gets you involved on public transport which was a nice change as it means you get to see a lot more of the city than you would on a normal walking tour. We kept seeing number 29 buses in the days following!Thanks for also arranging the trip to see a Boca Juniors match, we'd have had no chance sorting that out on our own."

We saw Jonathan's reviews on TA and decided to book him for a 1/2 day tour. We covered the Recoleta, the Plaza de Mayo and La Boca. In fact, had it not been for Jonathan, I would have skipped La Boca altogether. I'm glad the 1st timers in the group had the opportunity to see it.While we covered the main sights, I am also pleased to say that we all learned a great deal from Jonathan (despite this being my 3rd time in the city). Our group really felt like they saw not only the most important bits, but that they also gained perspective from someone who lives here and who understands what makes the place tick. We also enjoyed jonathan's wit and sense of humour. I will also say that the man has infinite patience - allowing us to stop for our many photos and bank machines attempts.I really appreciate the fact that we used public transport as it helped everyone see aspects of the city that we may not have otherwise seen.We have done walking / city tours before and I can definitely say that we would wholeheartedly recommend Jonathan.Thanks from Toronto."

We learned about the history of Tango, rode on the wood train (which is so cool) and met lovely people from the U.S. and abroad on this tour (Shout out to Marianne and Andrew). Needless to say, we had a great time!! Jonathan is super nice and he knows so much about the history of Buenos Aires. It was good to learn and to visit so many of the historic sites. He was kind enough to consider that we would need a food and bathroom break and we still had time to see everything of interest. He was even patient enough to wait on those of us who slowed the group down while we were taking photos. I would recommend doing this tour if it is your first time in Buenos Aires for sure! Oh, and how can I forget that Jonathan was also kind enough to explain the bus and subway system (by the 5th day we had already figured it out on our own). We wished that we had taken this tour earlier in our trip, however it was still great!"

Johnathan brought us to several of the major sights as well as lesser known neighbourhoods - I particularly loved the area around the Tango Singer Carlos Gardels house as the wall art was so colourful and it was great to visit such authentic areas. (See photos uploaded which I took on tour)Johnathan was friendly and interesting throughout the tour. His stories were entertaining and really informative.We expressed interest in attending a sold out Las Pumas vs All Blacks that was taking a place a couple of days later - Johnathan very kindly offered to arrange to source tickets for us and he followed up on this offer promptly the next day. He also emailed us a list of his recommendations i.e restaurants/coffee shops etc. Thank you Johnathan for your help and advice!The payment for this tour is via a tip at the end - which is much deserved for the time dedicated to the tours on a daily basis."

I am a very experienced solo traveler- have been to over 100 countries, taken lots and lots of tours of different cities and locations. This was definitely one of the best if not THE best. Jonathan is incredible. British guy, living in BA for more than 4-5 years. Smart as hell. Has all the qualities for a perfect guide. First- knowledge. Since I am very much interested in the history of spain-europe-indiginous people-Argentina, during the tour I asked him tens and tens of questions. His fund of knowledge is amazing. There was not one thing he didn't know and couldn't elaborate on in a very detailed way.But that's not the only thing that makes him a good guide. Jonathan has a sharp and special kind of sense of humor. He also is a master in telling fascinating stories. this combo is a great one: prepare to laugh and enjoy numerous anecdotes and stories about the city.Also- this is not going to be a tour only of the \"pink house\", \"Eva Peron cemetary\" etc. He will take you to hidden gems in the city- that no other tour will take you too.And By the way- I was in BA for a wedding of a good friend. My boss took the tour too, a day prior, and he absolutely loved it! I really think that a visit in BA is not going to be the same without Jonathans tour. You will learn so much about Argenina- and in such an amusing, fun and interesting way!!By the way- this is what Jonathan does. He does not charge money but bascially living on tips- so if you like it, be generous with him.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!Yair"

Unique because Jonathan is both a local, with a deep knowledge and experience of Buenos Aires, and a foreigner who is able to talk about the Argentinian culture and customs from an outsider point of view that makes sense to other foreigners. We did a Tango tour (Abasto) and visited Plaza de Mayo and other places in a tour that took about 4 hours. The group was small (5 people) and there was an intellectually stimulating, fun and friendly atmosphere all around. We asked Jonathan a lot of questions about Argentinian history and culture, and he was not only willing but also very interested to take the conversation to whatever direction we wanted, providing thoughtful, knowledgable comments. It is a pleasure to interact with such an educated and fun person as Jonathan and a great luck to have him as a tour guide!"

Check the website buenosaireslocaltours.com just in case, but in principle go to the steps within Plaza Italia. Easy via subte green line D. At 11am Jonathan will be waiting for you. Jonathan takes a very practical approach - by the end of his tour you will know how to get round the city by understanding addresses/distances on a map, the bus system and the metro/subte. This learning is included as part of a very interesting walk that included Carlos Gardel, Abasto, a colectivo public bus, the A line wooden metro car, Congresso, Casa de Rosado and a lot more including the most superb explanation of Palacio Barolo - Jonathan knows his stuff. All this is delivered with an obvious passion for the subject, tinged with humour and a hint of sadness as demonstrated when he accurately described the Windmill Building next to Congress as being a snapshot of recent Argentinian history. Rich, opulent, political, poor, neglected, waiting for the next chapter. A very good analogy. The walk was well paced and even though the duration was four hours there was never a moment when we were bored. In addition to the walk, you can also tap Jonathans local knowledge which is extensive. We asked for some additional information which was not to hand on the day but was delivered by email within 24 hours. This is billed as a \"free tour\" but we defy you to walk away giving nothing. We willingly gave our tip - reckon it was excellent value"

I was wanting to see the Palermo section of the city, and when his tour said the meeting point was in Palermo, near Plaza Italia I said \"sign me up\". When my friend and I got there and Jonathan said he was going to take us back towards the direction we came from, I wanted to leave since it seemed like it was just going to be a redo of everything else I had already seen. However, I decided to give him a chance since the group was very small and it would have been noticeable if we had bailed. He gave a great explanation of the bus system, which is very confusing - they publish a book to find your way around - and he gave clear directions on what to do when you get on the buses. The first stop we made was in the Abasto area, where we saw lots of tango related businesses and landmarks. With this stop alone I was happy that we had not left the group back at Plaza Italia. I would never have known about this area of the city if it werent for Jonathan's tour. For a non-Argentinian he had a great amount of knowledge of the buildings and city, even to the point that he told us new information about buildings we had already seen. We did not finish the whole tour with him because we had to be somewhere before the tour was over, but Jonathan was very helpful in giving us directions back to where we needed to be. He was super pleasant and interesting to talk to when we riding the buses. Even though we missed the end of the tour with him, we will definitely take his advice and ride the A line to see the wooden train cars."

Jonathan may be a Brit but you feel like you're getting an insider's view of Buenos Aires ... with wit and style and of course, perfect English. Though I had already spent some time in the city, his tour sure enlivened my experience of this big, noisy, confusing city. He has ta knack for making the stories, and miscellaneous facts interesting, even memorable. Definitely take this tour. The info on navigating with the masses on bus (colectivo) and subway(subte) are definitely worthwhile if you want to get more local."

I've lived in Buenos Aires for almost two years, and did Jonathan's tour last month with my parents, who'd come over to visit (there were no teenagers, but Trip Advisor's categories didn't give me much to work with...). I already knew most of the places we went to, and of course was already au fait with the bus and subte system, but all the same I found it a fascinating tour and learned a lot of interesting things about Buenos Aires. Abasto's a great area to discover and Jonathan's knowledge of his subject is top notch. I've done a few guided tours in my time in BA, and this has been the best of the lot."

Walking, buses and subte, interjected with humour and anecdotes makes this a must for any newcomer to BA. Great way to get your bearings (and pick up \"do's and don'ts\") and very well worth doing.

I was fortunate enough to stumble across Jonathan's TripAdvisor listing on a recent trip to Buenos Aires, and for four lost Americans it was the perfect way to both acclimate to the city and see some of the best sites in Buenos Aires.Logistics: We met Jonathan at the statue at the Plaza Italia at 11 AM and proceeded on a four hour tour through some of the most interesting parts of BA. Seeing the home of Carlos Gartel (the founder of Tango and apparently quite the debonair dude), taking the buses and antique subway, and passing by the Casa Rosada (the presidential palace where Evita made her famous speeches) were just a few of the great experiences we got to sample.Jonathan doesn't charge but makes a living on the tips, so we took care of him and couldn't have asked for a more informed or interesting afternoon. I would highly recommend it!"

Although Jonathan is British rather than Argentinian, he obviously has a passion for Argentina and its capital city. He is knowlegeable on historical sites and the ride on buses and subway (a wooden train built in the 1930's) was fun. Learning how to get about by public transport proved to be extremely useful for us as we explored Buenos Aires on our own in the next few days. Eventually we even managed to get to the Tigre Delta area by train (a one-hour ride from Retiro) and returned for just 2.5 pesos per person!We thoroughly enjoyed the tour of Abasto area where we get to know more about Carlos Gardel, the Tango King. The route has a good mix of cultural and historical sites. We had done another free city tour (by another company) the evening before and it's good that the two trips basically had very few overlapping sites. For us from Hong Kong who do not speak Spanish, Jonathan's English is easy to understand, and through his introduction, we get a feel of how expats see Argentina.Great job, Jonathan, and thanks!Mym and KM Leungfrom Hong Kong"

Not only it was extremely informative, but also fun and entertaining, took us to many places around town we wouldn't have otherwise visited, allowed us plenty of time to take pictures and have a coffee, answered every question we could come up with and even had a healthy doze of British humor. This is one excursion you don't want to miss. To be honest the word \"free\" first attracted my attention to this tour. I figured if the guide is willing to work for tips, he will make an extra effort to earn them, as opposed to pre-paid excursions. I felt that no matter how much money I paid at the end of our accidentally-private tour, Jonathan's effort was still greater, and this review is just an extra token of our appreciation for the tour and the view of Buenos Aires it gave us. Thanks."

However, when we heard rave reviews from several friends about Jonathan's tours, we figured a little refresher might help us enjoy our weekend. We were right.Jonathan is very knowledgeable in an interesting, \"insider info\" kind of way rather than just sticking to dry facts. The route the tour takes gives a good general overview of some of the main neighborhoods and sites in the city, and if you're planning to stay a while and use the bus system, he gives a great explanation of how to do just that. If you're new to Buenos Aires or just haven't been for a while, check out this tour on Day 1 to get the most out of your trip."

He could share a knowledgeable expat's insights into Argentine culture, history and politics. (Ask him for his two-word phrase to describe Argentina and Buenos Aires.)"

One of the hardest things to do as a new tourist in a city is to figure out the transport system - Jonathan de-mystified the local bus system so that we were able to use it frequently thereafter - meaning you are living the way the locals do and saving some pennies by not using taxis all the time. He takes you to a number of the famous and not-so-famous parts of BA - always with great stories and knowledge to impart. I would encourage anyone to do this tour, particularly early in your trip, as you will be much the wiser after it!"

You'll use mass transit (bus/subway), learn how it works so you can navigate/travel the city, visit slightly off the beaten path tourist destinations and best of all you'll spend time with a fellow who clearly loves his adopted city. And, frankly, in some ways, I think an expat can provide more nuanced information/explanation of a place than a local tour company. I know that sounds a little off but really...an expat can relate much better to a tourist's common questions/concerns/misunderstandings than a local because he probably struggled with the same issues. I did two free tours while in the city and the level of information/insight that I received from Jonathan far exceeded that from the other tour. He is a friendly, smart, and interesting fellow who's a fantastic travel resource. This was an all-around great experience."

We took other free walking tours and a bike tour in addition to this tour and I'd recommend all of them, but on this tour we learned how to use the buses which made all the difference in our stay in Buenos Aires. Jonathan, our guide, explained how to use the GuiaT (the bus riders' bible) to get from any spot in the city to another, as well as how and where to get the buses. We also used the subway which is easy, inexpensive (about .25 a ride), and fast. Jonathan took us to El Abasto (see the only kosher McDonalds outside of Israel), and to the Carlos Gardel house and museum which weren't on any of the other tours. The tour lasted about 3 hours including time for a quick lunch. The tour is free but I think most of us tipped Jonathan about 50 pesos."

We had an truly excellent day. Our guide, Jonathan, is a British ex-pat with a deep knowledge of the city and its history. He relies on voluntary donations at the end of his 3-3 1/2 hour tour and there is no hard sell. He's a truly nice guy and loves what he's doing. For the record, we gave him 100 pesos each (US$25/person) as that is what we had been charged the previous day by another tour company. It was worth every penny and then some.Jonathan differentiates himself in two ways: first, he takes you to interesting places ignored by the guide books and bigger companies and, second, he includes two trips on the collectivos (local buses) and one trip on the Subte (subway). That introduction to, and explanation of, the B.A. transit system is, by itself, worth the tour. Just show up; you won't be disappointed."

Our guide Chris hails from Boston and I was initially sceptical he would have the knowledge to keep me informed and entertained regarding all things Buenos Aires but he didn't disappoint. His familiarity with the buildings, places of interest and history was exceptional. And he has such a lovely manner and personality. We were certainly lucky in that there was only the two of us AND we got to experience the passion of BA by way of a particularly large protest rally that seemed more celebration than demonstration. This is the first walking tour I have ever been on and I would highly recommend it to visitors to this fine city. Chris pointed us in the direction of a great little eatery with the best empanadas as we parted company. Well worth the tip we gave Chris."

We found the pace a bit challenging towards the end as distances between stops grew. We felt like we were holding back some of the others.

We (a couple) paid 300 pesos for each which we thought was reasonable given the size of the crowd on the tours we took.

Martin was so steeped in knowledge about the history and politics it was almost like a university lecture. I liked the fact that he kept on time and finished early. Our second tour Recoleta was good but not as the first. Our guide was friendly and knowledgeable but it was also hot with a large group and slo moving. We finished 30 minutes late and with hungry boys that was difficult. What I like about these tours (this is my third one all over the world) is they are not really free but you are not paying for a bad experience. If you don't like the tour or the guide you leave and pay nothing. If you have a great experience you pay more. I think this is a great movement for budget travelers and my wife was always bugging me to stop listening to other tour guides-so this is perfect. That said we did hire a private tour guide in istanbul and have one tomorrow and believe those are also worth the money because they take you to places that most tourists wont visit."

It is an amazing cemetery, not like any other I've ever seen. My tour guide, Soledad, was bilingual, speaking excellent English. She brought to life many interesting stories of the people and the grave sites that I would not have known if I had walked it alone. She also gave a lot of the history of Buenos Aires as we walked the cemetery. The creativity of grave sites was amazing. I think this was the best way to get the most out of a visit to La Recoleta Cemetery."

Then your set to explore the city on foot! Martin leads u through the great surrounding areas in Roceleta ending up at the famous Recoleta cemetery!Highly recommend this tour especially on your first or second day here in Buenos Aries.They take a break at a nice coffe shop where you can grab a bite to eat too if you missed breakfast! A good pace and very informative. Walking tours aren't just about the sites you learn so much more, a bit of politics, history, how things generally work, do & dont's, what's polite here in this culture etc.......We did the afternoon tour as well the next day, which was good, though it is noisy with traffic and the guide doesn't pick the best places to stop & talk as the traffic is buzzing by loudly. The talks are a bit long when your trying to hear, better if she had a microphone & cut down on the info a bit. But definitely worth while."

Fernando our fearsome guide (and lawyer) was informative, interactive, full of fascinating facts, funny stories and made the 2.5 hour morning tour very interesting. He conducted the tour in excellent English. It was the perfect way to get an overview of the city and decide if you wanted to spend more time at any one particular place and as such should be done at the beginning of your stay.We learnt about the history of a relatively young Buenos Aires and Argentina. The influences of the French, Italian, Spanish, Swiss and British. He talked about the juxtaposition of the architectural styles, the acoustically sound Teatro Colon, Plaza Libertade and the Jewish quarter. He referenced politicians including the strange site of a monument to General Lavalee erected outside the palace of his most famous conquest, General Doreggo. Our tour also included some of the bigger tourist attractions in Buenos Aires like The Obelisk, Monument to General San Martin, Cabildo, Falkland/Malvinas Memorial and the British Clock Tower. We saw the fascinating \"singing forest\", the impressive Kavanagh building (and learnt of its sad history in obscuring the Metropolitan Cathedral) and the San Martin Palace. We learnt about figures on Argentinian notes, coming out of bankruptcy, the history of slaves, those that disappeared and the tragic story of AMIA prosecutor Alberto Nisman.We finished at Recoletta Cemetery where we learnt about Lola Mora, Eva Peron and Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry - laureate Luis Federico Leloir, amongst others. WOW - all in 2.5 hours!!. well done, Fernando, you rock...Although advertised as \"free\", a donation is the very least one could do...!Highly recommended..."

Vicky was brilliant. She was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about her city and a lovely person too. We had a great time. Whilst this tour is free, please show your appreciation to Vicky or whoever else is your guide by generously tipping them as we did, it really was worth the money.Sadly just after the tour finished my husband was mugged and his watch was forcibly removed from his arm by two men who got away on two motorbikes that were waiting for them so when in BA be very careful and watchful and hide or leave all your valuables somewhere safe.Fortunately my husband sustained no injuries other than a few scratches and the loss of an expensive watch which he forgot to take off before leaving our cruise ship."

Cuzco was ok but they went hours over the allotted time so our plans were ruined. This BA one seemed very well organised and she controlled the schedule very well even after serious rain that prevented us starting for at least 30/40 mins. Lorrie impressed with her huge local knowledge many times. She could even tell me the Latin names of native trees - that definitely shouldn't be expected!Smart girl, smart tour, well worth the walk and tips. Off to do the afternoon one today!"

Yes you can have a tour book, and look and read about the buildings but everything come alive when these enthusiastic guides are bringing history, art, culture together. The tour is free but after spending 3-4 hours with each of them you cannot leave without giving them a tip. How much is up to you and your pocket. An other advantage is meeting a bunch of interesting people that are sharing the experience with you and sometime adding to make the walking even ,more enjoyable.i hope they are adding more tours for other areas of the City."

Told with a lot of humor and compassion, I could feel the essence of what the argentinian people has had to live with for decades of changing governments. I feel I have gained a much deeper knowledge about Buenos Aires, than I would ever get out of any museum and it also makes me love the city in a total different way, being close to the heart of it and those two people - so knowledgeable and engaged in the life of it!

Both tours were excellent in regards to the content, route and friendliness of the guides. We had a fantastic time in both.One issue. The morning tour ends in the cemetery which is quite a way from the town centre and our tour did not finish at 13:00 or 13:30 but actually went until 14:15. I felt that this was quite long time and did not leave much of the afternoon by the time you had lunch and got back to centre of town. Perhaps the tour could start at 10:00, a much better start time I feel.Having said this both guides were outstanding and I would recommend doing both tours to anyone travelling to BA!"

It is not a fancy place, but it is the real deal. You will definitely be asked to dance here and you best get up and do it because it is like no other experience.

Right amount of history and sights seen. Only 6 on the trip so that was great, although unusual. Went to the 5pm and had Maggie. She was good but a little long winded for my taste, but still a nice tour. I gave each $200 pesos ($20US /blue exchange). I seemed to be the biggest tipper which seemed like my fellow tour goers may have been a little tight. I highly recommend both. I'd start with the 11am and then wait a day.

Soledad certainly gave us the introduction we were looking for. I met again the expert in architecture, literature and savoir vivre I remembered from Berlin. (Having taught literature half a life you don\u2019t want to get mucked around with in this respect.) My wife as well was glad to meet a charming guide who does not only know her home town but who looked beyond. Above all Soledad tells it with humor. But you better watch out. She even taught some nasty policemen a lesson who wanted to deny us access to a historic building in an exciting off-the-track-barrio. I was perfectly entertained and always felt safe in her company. Only minus for me: It was too much for my old bones. I had to quit after two thirds of the way. Of course I immediately regretted when my wife came back to the hotel and told me about the wonderful evening they spent on some hidden Tango milonga. So I dare to say if there was a Kamasutra of Sightseeing to be written, Soledad could write it - she teaches you to love her home town ;-) Thanks for the inspiration and the precious contribution to one of the most beautiful trips of our life.

On our first full day in Buenos Aires last spring, my friend and I had the good sense and very good fortune to choose Eilat Jelin as our guide there. Buenos Aires Free Walking Tours is Eilat\u2019s recent venture aimed at accommodating the demand for her tours of the city\u2019s diverse neighborhoods. Through two-hour, introductory walking tours, at no cost, Eilat and her partners give visitors a glimpse of BA and whet one\u2019s appetite for much more.Eilat possesses all the expected attributes of a great guide in spades, but, in addition, she is especially quick to get a sense of exactly what interests her clients most. Too, she doesn\u2019t waste one\u2019s time during her tours on museums, street fairs, and other interesting but time-consuming spots. Instead, Eilat points them out and recommends those that one should not miss on their own time.Specifically, Eilat showed us six BA neighborhoods in our day together, educating us about the city and Argentina along the way; took us to a fabulous, 120-year-old French pastry shop and a small but amazing, off-the-radar tapas restaurant; told us of a book store we had to see; and assisted us in several ways that made the rest of our visit to BA far better than it would have been otherwise.[Note: If our experience is representative, finding good tango on one\u2019s own can be most difficult.]"

A small group of us visited Iguazu Falls for a few days and Madi provided excellent services such as an airport/hotel transfer and a great tour of the Argentinian and Brazilian sides. Madi was always quick to respond to our enquiries and very efficient in organizing things, even at short notice. I am very happy to recommend her services to others."

            "review": "Far more than I had expected. I started at zero. A three-week window had opened unexpectedly in my calendar. I wanted to book a bonus flight in Lufthansa's first class on their longest non-stop connection. Buenos Aires met all these criteria. So now I had a flight there and back - and no idea what to do in Argentina in June/July.After checking a number of German travel agencies I came across BA Cultural Concierge Tours in the web and sent them an email. They answered promptly, asking about my preferences. Next we set up a skype call and Madi and I talked for about one hour. She sent the first draft of her suggested travel-plan about three days later. We discussed and adjusted a number of details, and within another 3 days I had all my confirmations.We had set up a completely individualistic journey for someone who speaks only minimal Spanish and cannot travel in groups because he drives everyone crazy by taking his time for shooting just the right photos in just the right locations.Throughout the entire trip everything worked exactly as planned: people showed up at airports to pick me up and take me to the hotel. Tour guides were all knowledgeable, friendly and reliable. Most of them were also very helpful with photographic hints and support. Hotels were exactly as booked in location and quality. Even the flights were on time :-)I got so much more out of this trip than I had expected. Yes, great photos, stunning. But I got to know so many people too, wonderful, open-minded and interesting people. And nature and wildlife were just unbelievable. So I know I'll be back to see the South of Argentina. And I know I'll be organizing my trip through BA CC again.Just to give you an idea of the complexity of what Madi and Juan organized in a really short time, here's my itinerary:* pick up at BA international airport and transfer to the hotel* same afternoon walking tour with guide through La Boca and San Telmo* next day walking tour with a well-known architect to see Art Deco and other fancy buildings* next day walking tour with a pro photographer to LaRecoleta cemetery and other locations* next day I had to myself, walking around BA, taking pictures* night bus to Mercedes (Corrientes) and transfer to a (really) small place in the middle of the Esteros de Iber\u00e1 wetlands* two days with a personal wildlife-guide, boat ride across the lagoon, birds, caiman, water-deers, capibaras, monkeys, you name it* transfer to Puerto Iguazu * one day on the Argentinian side, one day on the Brazilian side, you have to do both sides if you go!* Flight to Salta, walk around the city* day trip with guide to Cafayate, unbelievable landscape, nice lamas* day trip with guide to Purmamarca and Humahuaca, more incredible landscape, colours, skies* got drawn into a fiesta on main plaza, celebrating 200 years independence, wow, photos, fun, music* flight to Mendoza* 4WD trip with guide into the Andes, up to 3.500 meters, unfortunately the highest mountains were covered in clouds. So we went to an alternative destination. A mountain of seven colours, so unreal that people back home think I faked the photos :-)* next day a tour through three wineries with a great master-sommelier as my guide. And great wines to taste and enjoy.* flight to BA, night in BA, transfer to international airport.They booked all this, down to seat reservations in the night bus (a must-have!!!) and I think the also booked the wild Guanacos to show up just in time. And they really are available 24/7 via phone if you need their immediate support, which luckily wasn't the case for me. But it still felt good to know I had a number I could call if the need should arise.Thanks Madi and Juan, you did such a wonderful job!!!"

My husband and I planned our trip to Buenos Aires on the spur of the moment and we could not have done it without the help of BACC! As a mother of two young children and a business owner, I didn't have time to plan out our trip in such a short time. We put all of our trust in Madi and she did not disappoint!!! She catered to our specific needs as a family, helped us find the most lovely apartments in both Recoleta and Palermo Soho. She helped us plan side trips, book tickets, navigate the city and offer advice on nearly everything to do in two months time! I felt like we had our own personal tour guide at any given moment and her response time was amazing. She also saved us money by suggesting tours that are less expensive but just as good, if not better! She went above and beyond in connecting us with friends in Uruguay for our trip to Jose Ignacio. Madi is professional in every sense of the word and we could not have done it without her. Highly recommend BACC!!!! Just book her! You will spend less time looking through your book and on the internet and more time looking at the amazing city right in front of you. Enjoy! :-)"

Well, because of the amazing staff at BACC, I had my most amazing vacation yet!I was a bit nervous since I originally planned this trip as an able bodied person, but then having to modify things for my injured foot. I googled \"low mobility tours\" and the BA Cultural Concierge website came up. After one short email through their automated site, Madi contacted me to get the ball rolling. She was extremely helpful in planning things out with me via email and skype. The best part is that everything was planned with my injury and (meager) budget in mind.I spent one full day touring with Madi around the La Boca area and was delighted to hear all of the history and cool stories behind each building, painting and street. I was truly impressed with her knowledge of the area and in awe her ability to truly bring to life the city we walked. I never once felt pressured to do more than I felt able (side note- it was recommended that I just use the crutches and go at my own pace since the streets were a bit too bumpy for a wheel chair) Even further, when I was unable to make change for a cab, Madi was kind enough to pay for it until I could find change! That's one of the little things that really impressed me about her and the service. By the time the day tour was over, I was confident that I knew PLENTY about the area, but also that I had made a friend. :) Here's to you Madi!After our tour, Madi continued to help me plan out an amazing schedule of activities based on my interests. I went to \"The Argentine Experience\" - highly recommended for the single traveler or anyone who loves food and wine. I was able to catch a Cirque Du Solei show- Kooza, and barely had time to clap because I was so amazed. I spent an afternoon wandering around Palermo and attended a world class polo match. I basically had the time of my life all thanks to Madi and the super helpful staff at BACC. To anyone looking for a one of a kind plan that will make your experience in Buenos Aires memorable, do yourself a favor and hire the BA Cultural Concierge. You won't regret it."

As we went, Juan stopped and used the murals and graffiti as a launching point to discuss the history of immigration and the working class in La Boca. Juan took all of our group's questions, and made sure to weave our conversations into discussions of common themes throughout the tour. As a result, I left with a sense of how La Boca fits into the broader picture of Buenos Aires and Argentina. More than I expected, and highly recommended."

Cultural Concierge was recommended by Seattle friends who raved about the service. Madi told us about our options and as we are walkers who are fine with exploring on our own, we decided that a day tour would be nonetheless helpful as we had never been to South America, let alone BA, before. Prices are very reasonable and we felt it would be a good investment. And it was. Nestor Mentasti, one of CC's guides, met us promptly at our hotel (and brought pesos for us to exchange). He then took us to neighborhoods and a few sites for about 5 1/2 hours. He was terrific; full of interesting information but also a really nice person who was easy to talk to. We went to La Boca, San Telmo, and Monserrat, then headed to Recoleta to wander the cemetery where Eva Peron, among others, is buried. Along the way we stopped at shops, admired the street art, stopped into the Metropolitan Cathedral where Pope Francis had said mass as Archbishop of BA, and talked politics at the Plaza de Mayo, which is across the street from the Pink House, the executive mansion of the President. There is so much we saw it's hard to remember. it all. We did get a good sense of where we wanted to return in the remaining time we spent in BA as well. Since we were staying in the Palmero neighborhood, our tour allowed us to see areas of the city we were not near. It was wonderful having our own tour and not feeling \"herded\" around the city. Doing this at the start of our stay was also great for encouraging a sense of confidence that we could navigate BA ourselves. I highly recommend BA Cultural Concierge, whether you hire them to plan your entire stay, or simply do a day as we did. Nestor was exceptional, as well, if he is available."

We were a multi-gen group with elder grandparents and children ages 11 and 13. We started with a half-day tour with Juan, and he truly has a knack for people. Everyone adored him. He handled the grandparents with graciousness and kindness, and my children were completely charmed by his easy manner. My son (who doesn't generally like to talk with adults) liked Juan so much that he wished Juan could have joined us on other days just so he could talk more with him. And, the kicker is that my kids actually learned a lot of history, politics, and culture from Juan (and the next day from Madi) while thoroughly enjoying themselves. Juan had an impressive amount of information at his fingertips.We had a full-day tour of the Tigre Delta (boat ride + picnic) with Madi, and that was again a completely delightful experience. Madi is lovely and great with everyone. As an American living in BA, she can offer a very interesting comparative perspective, and has an encyclopedic knowledge. Even the story of her journey from landing in BA to creating this company was really absorbing to us. We also appreciated the care she took with accommodating our dietary preferences with the picnic.What I noticed is that she works with wonderful people--for the boat ride, we had a guide also named Juan who told us tons about the specific flora and history of the Delta, plus he was a thoroughly nice person. And, we also really liked our driver Dario. We felt very safe and comfortable in his care.I can't imagine who wouldn't have a fabulous time with the BA Cultural Concierge team. We asked Madi and Juan about everything from trees to political history to even cow parts, and they knew how to give us just the right amount of info without overwhelming us. The content of the tours were also well thought out: showing us not only the beautiful sites and historical venues, but also how regular folk live, which was particularly interesting.All the other details that Madi took care of made our time seamless: the restaurant reservations and all the questions she answered before we even arrived in BA.

We were extremely pleased with the service level and attention given to our group of 10 people. Madi (Owner) was our primary contact who was extremely responsive and flexible in creating an itinerary for our 5 days in Buenos Aires. Our guide in the City and Delta was Juan who is very outgoing and informative. Great sense of humor and very attentive to the needs of the group. Our guide for experiencing a working gaucho ranch and visiting San Antonio De Areco was Guillermo who was equally as good as Juan. Of course the food in BA is excellent and Madi gave us great restaurant recommendations as well as making the reservations for us before we arrived in Argentina as these are popular places. You cannot go wrong with the attention and service that Madi and her team provides you during your visit to Buenos Aires. They provided great tips for first timers to South America. Look for their website."

It gave me a great lay of the land while getting to very cool historical facts at the same time. Great price too!Madi was very professional and accommodating. When traveling there are already so many things to worry about so, working with Madi is wonderful in just alleviating the stress alone. I've used them now to book tickets to shows, weekend get aways, and a trip to Pategonia. It's the best. Just have an idea of what you want to do and they'll take care of all the work. The best part is you'll most likely get to do what you wanted for a better price. I can't recommend them enough and will continue to use them when I can."

I do not usually leave guest feedback but after an AMAZING week of touring Buenos Aires, I felt compelled to say what a wonderful itinerary Madi Lang arranged for our family. Having an agenda to work from that was pre-planned made all the difference in the world. I began to work with Madi 6 weeks prior to our trip requesting help in arranging an apartment for us and an educational, fun framework of touring and relaxing. Madi helped arrange and negotiated a beautiful apartment for us in lovely Recoleta. The apartment was like a little piece of paradise after a day of touring. My daughter recently had knee surgery so Madi was able to arrange all driving tours of the city for us as well which was so wonderful! We did the city tours of BA, went on the Graffiti Mundo tour, took a boat tour of the Tigre Delta, took the ferry to Colonia, Uruguay, toured Colonia then spent a lovely day at Rio Ancho in the country where we had a baking class and finally went to Kensho for a vegan cooking class with Chef Maximo. Our days were full and our evenings were spent relaxing street-side in cafes sipping wine. It was a wonderfully clean city, filled with nice people and lovely architecture. Our guides Nester, Juan and driver Dario were absolutely the BEST! We would not be going home with such nice family memories of this great city without all of them. We would not hesitate to go back and use the services of BA Cultural Concierge!"

Based on TripAdvisor reviews, I knew I needed to book Madi Lang of BA Cultural Concierge fairly early on in our cruise planning for South America. The group from our ship was overjoyed with Madi's tour! We agreed on a tailored-tour of B.A. based on her recommendations which was a nice balance between viewing from the van and walking tours in selected areas. Madi is originally from Maryland, USA and has lived in B.A. for about 8 years. She is an expert in Argentinian arts, culture, history and politics. She has an obvious love for B.A. and its residents and is also a very-well organized tour guide. Under her skilfull narration, B.A. came alive for us. We ended our tour in a wine bar (\"Pain et Vin\") where we tasted some wonderful red, white, rose and blends along with bread made on the premises and some olive/cheese plates. Mention should also be made of the very professional driver Madi employs who always seemed to be at the right place and time to pick us up. Our tour with Madi was, for me, the best tour my wife and I took while on our South American cruise. Book early and often!!!"

We invited friends a year out with the thinking that maybe 10 folks might join if we were lucky. As the \"confirmed\" count climbed above 25, we knew it was time to engage a professional. I came across Madi Lang doing a simple internet search and reading reviews. From the first consultation on the phone to the flawless execution of a week of hospitality and events, to the follow-up after, Madi and her network of partners far exceeded our expectations. In the end, Madi and her team took care of over 35 people, providing bespoke arrangements and hospitality for each based on their wishes and needs, and created an inspiring and incredible party none of our guests will soon forget - all created and curated with an impeccable eye and taste level.Madi was personally invested in creating stress-free experience, and the ultimate happiness of our guests. She and her team were accountable and communicative, and passionate about sharing all that Buenos Aires has to offer. I highly recommend Madi and BA Cultural Concierge without reservation to anyone looking to make their trip to BA memorable."

Although we are well traveled and do a lot of research, since we were not staying at a hotel we decided to hire a concierge service. And we were really glad we did and even happier that we found Madi.She arranged all our restaurant reservations, arranged our tours, which were all incredible. She helped us decide what was worthwhile and what was not, so our time was used very wisely. Her ability to arrange anything from hard to get Boca Junior tickets to touring Milongas at night was amazing. The tour guides that she recommended from the amazing Ernesto to Juan to Graffitimundo were perfect. When there were problems such as one of the tour guides not showing up, she was on top of it immediately. Or when we were ringing the doorbell at a restaurant at 10 pm and they closed that night without any notification, she and Juan called multiple restaurants to see where we could get in.She was so much better then any hotel concierge that I have ever worked with and wish she would expand her services to many more places.We can't recommend her enough. If you are going to BA or anywhere in Argentina, do yourself a favor, save yourself a lot of headaches and hire her. Her services are worth every penny."

We just returned from an 11 day cruise from RIo to Buenos Aires and ending our cruise in Buenos Aires was the best part of our trip thanks to BA Cultural Concierge and Madi Lang. We are real planners and booked with Madi nealy a year in advance and we are so glad that we did. Madi took care of everything in Buenos Aires for us and even booked us flights and a private tour in Iguazu Falls. My only regret is that we did not spend more time in Buenos Aires and touring with Madi. Everything we requested was done exactly as planned. Madi met us at the port for our first day and took us on a wonderful tour of the highlights of Buenos Aires. As an American living in Buenos Aires, it is clear that Madi loves the city. I felt like I was touring with an old friend. She showed us the highlights that we requested and got us back to the ship by 2 PM as we had requested. The next day we disembarked the ship and Madi had arranged our transportation to our hotel as well as a dinner/tango show that night. She also did all the planning for our flight to Iguazu Falls the next morning including booking our flights, arranging for transportation to the airport and booking a tour guide (also excellent) and transportation in Iguazu Falls. The service was outstanding and Madi and her tean take care of every detail including delivering printing and delivering our bordering passes on our last day. We traveled with another couple and I have to say that Madi made me look like a genius since I was the one who did the planning with her. Thanks Madi."

Later, we asked for a specialized walking tour focused on literature and architecture and Madi made it happen on pretty short notice! It was such a memorable experience because Eduardo is a famous local architect. Not only that but corresponding with Madi in advance of my trip made me feel a lot more relaxed since I had never been to Argentina before.

Our trip focused on art and architecture, which are our particular favorites. On various days we enjoyed formal tours of the city including a really in depth one with Juan who works with Madi.

It was a really fun and colourful area, and Juan was so knowledgeable and passionate about his city, and heaps of fun to hang out with.The next 2 days Madi and I visited Recoleta Cemetary, Casa Rosado and the central city, and the Puerto Madero area.

Over a year ago my wife and I, along with our friends with whom we would be traveling, decided to spend six days in Buenos Aires following a cruise that departed Valparaiso, Chile and ended in Buenos Aires on February 1st 2014. After researching private tours in Buenos Aires, we discovered BA Cultural Concierge on Trip Advisor and we are so thankful that we did. Madi Lang is the owner of the business; I was elected to contact her via her website baculturalconcierge.com. Over the intervening months, Madi worked with the four of us via email and telephone, as she developed and refined a completely unique and absolutely perfect itinerary for all six days of our visit. The services she provided included pre-arranging transfers (whenever and wherever we needed them); arranging for Juan to meet us at the ship followed by a fantastic city tour that ended with him assisting us with the check in process at our rental condo \u2013 Superb job Juan; helping us to exchange USD to Argentine pesos after we arrived, booking our roundtrip airline reservations to Iguazu (to include transfers once we arrived there); purchasing tickets for the English language tour of the Teatro Colon well ahead of the date we would visit the teatro; arranging for Nestor to drive us to Recoleta cemetery where he gave us a wonderful tour, followed by driving us to parts of the city that we would never have found on our own; arranging for a late-night visit/tour with Mariana of three Milongas (where the real Portenos go to tango); and making dinner reservations for us at two terrific restaurants in Palermo Soho that were within walking distance of the condo. Madi also insured that Nestor was available to be our driver every day. His amazing knowledge of the city and wonderful sense of humor made our time together especially enjoyable. Some of the aforementioned items required interim payments early in the proces, and the remainder, we paid directly to Madi in USD cash when we arrived in BA on 1 February. We are so happy with the services that she and her team, who for us included (besides Madi), Juan Palacios, Nestor, and her \u201ctango fanatic\u201d Mariana. Madi also arranged for a full day tour of the Tigre Delta and, fortunately for us, personally acted as our guide. We had so much fun together, it seemed like we had known her forever The day began with a walking tour of the picturesque town of San Isidro and a visit to the wonderful Victorian residence of Argentine writer and intellectual, Victoria O Campo where we enjoyed a fabulous lunch. After lunch we had a boat tour of the Rio de la Plata Delta, which was pre-arranged by Madi. We enjoyed exploring the various waterways of the delta, seeing homes on the numerous islands that can only be reached by boat. We had lots of laughs with Madi throughout our visit and couldn\u2019t have been any more pleased with her services or comfortable with her personally. Madi Lang and her team insured that we were taken care of every minute we were in Buenos Aries \u2013 they were only a cell phone call away the entire time. She has the business skills, knowledge, personal network, and exceptional interpersonal skills which, in combination with her outstanding team, make BA Cultural Concierge the epitome of what a private, personal, tour operator should be. So, our recommendation is to be smart and contact her\u2026the earlier the better! I know that you will be as pleased as we were. She is a genuine gem\u2026and great fun too, and\u2026as a bonus, you\u2019ll leave with a friend in Buenos Aires."

Traveling to a city with the size and complexities of Buenos Aires can be intimidating if one is not familiar with the language to say the least. Having Madi and her fine friends and employees, Jaun, Nestor, and Ernesto, organize our tours and accompany us was like having good friends in the city. Completely customized to our needs we felt like we got as much out of the city as we could in the few days we were there. Visiting in February or January is somewhat frustrating because many of the cultural activities are not happening, but still we felt we got the highlight,and some very unique experiences that we would never found on our own. We had an incredible introduction to making Empanadas by the Chef owner of El Federal, which is a superb restaurant for Argentine cuisine. We highly recommend BA Cultural Concierge. One caution however beware of imitators."

Not knowing anything about BA and where to start, she designed our 4 days there with each of our grown children and our interests in mind. Tango lessons, cooking class of regional cuisine, bike tour of parks and monuments, private restaurants for New Years Eve and a thorough history of the city and it's politics. She helped make it not only a memorable experience but a highly educational one as well. I particularily recommend another US Expat she set us up with: Biking BA. I will submit a seperate review on Robin at Biking Buenos Aires. My wife and I were travelling with our two grown sons and daughter-in-law. We wanted more than just the sights, but to experience the city as much as possible in 4 days. Over all, I highly recommend Madi and her contacts: from hotel recommendations, to dinners at smaller \"private\" restaurants, to specialized activities. One of her guides even helped us purchase SIM cards for our cell phones and exchange money at most favorable rates."

Contact by email was very efficient and, although Madi herself was booked, she set us up with the Tango dance lesson and tango night out with Mariana and a half day tour with her associated Juan. Could not recommend both more highly as things to do as an intro to BA. Even though we had just arrived that morning and were a bit lagged, the tango lessons (for a family of five) were totally enjoyable, informative and gave us a great insight into tango. We then visited three different milongas at different skill levels to see how the locals do it. The tour with Juan the next day was also outstanding. Juan is an anthropologist and the tour (mostly of the original city locations) gave us a great overview of the origins of the city, its development into the Paris of the South and its history through to recent times. I have been on many such tours but this was by far the most relaxed AND informative. It was Sunday so we passed through the vast markets and Juan even helped broker a few deals for us. You can see that Juan enjoyed exploring the nooks and crannies of the city as much as we did and he even seemed to find a few new places to visit along the way."

By the end of the week Madi felt like a trusted friend, not a tour guide. So much so that when we left for Iguazu Falls our son kept saying \"I wish Madi was here to tell us about that.\" or sometimes just \"I miss Madi.\" Her love for the city and country she has made her home are obvious, and we were able to experience Buenos Aires in a way that would never have been possible without her. The experience was so amazing that our original walking tour and day in El Tigre turned into multiple days of additional personalized tours, fun, food, history and laughter. And when we missed out flight from Iguazu and were suddenly at risk of missing our international flight home, she jumped into action letting the driver she had arranged know and making sure that we had the best chance possible of making the flight (which,thankfully, we did).Whether you are a seasoned world traveler, or this is your first trip abroad, you simply cannot do better than BA Cultural Concierge. Thank you Madi for the amazing memories, we cannot wait to see you again."

I emailed Madi many times prior to our arrival and she took care of everything with many excellent suggestions. She arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport (at half the price we would have paid a taxi or our hotel) also took us to our ship on the last day and drove us for our tour with Madi. Madi gave us an excellent full day tour of the different areas of Buenos Aires. She is very pleasant and knowledgable, a real sweetheart to spend the day with. Clearly she loves Buenos Aires and wants to share that with you. This was our first time to visit Buenos Aires so we had LOTS of questions before we arrived - where to stay, what to do, where to eat, etc. Madi is very prompt to answer emails and had many thoughtful suggestions. She made dinner reservations, tango show reservations, and arranged for us to visit 3 milongas at night with a tango dancer. We left Buenos Aires with a feeling that we had experienced this wonderful city.

On my second outing we went to the Mataderos fair which was so interesting, followed up by the fair at San Telmo to catch the inevitable tango...... amongst other things. Both were really different and I feel Juan and I became firm friends rather than tour guide and customer. I particularly liked trying the street food on offer as well as getting close to the locals. His understanding of the city's history also made my city tour fly by. Madi also arranged for a \"photography lesson/tour\" with Foto Ruta. Joss was my guide/teacher for the day. Madi and Joss made sure I didn't visit the same sites twice. This made such an impression that I decided to take a smilar tour/lesson in Santiago the next week. My whole BA trip was a joy.

It's now been a year since i spent a month in BA, and when i think back to the wonderful stories, places and people i met, they all seem to sprout from the afternoon tour i took with Madi. She seriously knows her stuff, and introduced me to a mountain of knowledge and culture i wouldn't have come across otherwise. When booking, she emailed me back the next day, and asked what i wanted to see, how long i was going to be there, and what (if anything) i had heard about before, and offered numerous suggestions (in a friendly, and non pushy way) that had me even more excited in getting there. Punctual, warm and friendly, and with a great passion for the place, she oozed enthusiasm for the city and the people within it. So much so, i took 2 more tours with her over the following weeks! Taking an afternoon tour with Madi is a definite requirement for visiting BA, and i know when i'm back next i'll be wowing my friends with another one. I couldnt do the vibe and feel of the place justice, and she sure can! great for any age, and a massive eye opener to one of the greatest cities in the world!"

My husband and I visited buenos aires as part of our honeymoon while touring around South America. She was the only \"concierge\" service we booked so I was a little sceptical as to what her service entailed. I cannot believe now that I would have ever considered not booking her. Not only is she reasonably priced but she saved us so much time with five laid out days of itineraries (including some down time) and saved us money by recommending restaurants where locals eat. Without us knowing she requested that we have the most romantic seat in each restaurant and some restaurants even gave us a complimentary glass of prosecco when Madi told them thst we were on honeymoon! She arranged a trip to Uruguay, futbol a tango show and so much more for us. Her tour of the city was refreshing and interesting. She also dropped us in a local phone and arranged airport transfers for us. She was on the email to me constantly during our stay answering my many last minute queries. She also was quick to reply to my many emails prior to our visit. I really cannot recommend her highly enough."

My wife found Madi while searching the web and we now realize how lucky a find this was for us. Madi asked all the right questions and got to know us well before the planning began. We were traveling with our two daughters (4 & 8) and we obviously needed to keep them entertained. She had a ton of great suggestions and we narrowed the trip down to some specific events that gave us just the right amount of arranged appointments and free time to roam the city. The attractions and people she set us up with were all fantastic, we loved them all and felt we made friends along the way. We left BA for Chile where we had done our own planning and this leg of the trip was no where near as cool as what we had with Madi at the lead. If only she had been our Concierge in Chile...The trip was a perfect and we truly thank Madi for her role in making it happen. Our family is a big fan of BA Cultural Concierge!

A few weeks before arriving in the city, I emailed back and forth with Madi from BA Cultural Concierge and she was always prompt to answer any questions in a very friendly and approachable way. I knew before meeting Madi that it was going to be a wonderful experience and I was right! Madi came to my hotel to meet me on my first day and we took a taxi together to experience the Feria de Mataderos. On the first day in a new city, it\u2019s so nice and definitely takes a load off being with a local who knows exactly where to go. Madi was able to guide us around to all the different stalls and because she knew I was a foodie from our emails, she made sure to take us to this amazing pulperia for empanadas and locra stew made fresh right in front of you. Not very many people working in the Feria speak English so it was so helpful to have Madi, who\u2019s Spanish is excellent and beyond impressive, to ask questions about certain products that were being sold in the stalls. To end the day, Madi busted out a thermos and mate gourd and made us mate which was an amazing touch of the local culture but also helped warm us up on a particularly chilly day. It was such a sweet thing to think of to do. Madi naturally creates a sense of comfort that makes it feel like you\u2019re just hanging out with a friend. For my second day, we had wanted to get a historical tour/background on Buenos Aires as well as get acquainted with the public transport so that we had a good base to work off of the rest of the week, so I enlisted the amazing help of Madi again. She showed my mom and I how to use the bus and subway and what the best route to take would be for certain locations so that when left on our own for the rest of the week we\u2019d know exactly what to do and where to go. Along with her extensive knowledge and genuine passion for Buenos Aires, Madi from BA Cultural Concierge truly knows how to provide an incredible tour. I would most definitely recommend her to anyone who wants a personalized and friendly experience!"

Our experience was awesome and she was just an email or phone call away to make last minute adjustments and to help us navigate through the city. We are very experienced travelers but she is an expert on the city, the sites and the surrounding areas. She sent a pre-trip check list that included a reading list, packing tips and other helpful ideas. We corresponded through e-mail and Skype before the trip and she sent a day by day itinerary that was easy to follow and very thorough.

We found BA Cultural Concierge and Madi Lang in October 2010 on the Lonely Planet guide to Argentina as a highly recommended cultural concierge. We were looking for someone to help us find an apartment to stay in, because we were a bit overwhelmed by all the apartment listings (and they were filling up really quickly).To be honest, it felt a bit strange for us to think of hiring a concierge in the beginning, because my girlfriend and I are not exactly the \"Concierge\" type. We're seasoned explorers with plenty of experience dealing with situations that would stress out or frustrate most people. However, as we were short on time, and really felt like it would make a difference for someone on the ground in Buenos Aires to be able to look at the apartment, check on the contract / landlord, we recruited Madi to help and report back to us.From the very beginning, Madi comes across as a very professional and courteous person. She got started within 24 hours of our request, and in a little over three days had an apartment that later turned out to be absolutely fantastic (we're still living in it!). We sent her what seemed like an infinitely long shortlist, and she went to visit each one of the ones available to give us the pros and cons of each place. When I landed in Buenos Aires, she was waiting for me at the apartment to help me with the paper work and give me a small welcome talk. She also helped me peruse the rental contract (as it was in Spanish), and check for any inconsistencies before I signed it.We were so impressed with her work that we recruited her a second time to help us find a weekend getaway in San Antonio de Areco during the gaucho festival in November. She managed to find an available estancia that later turned out to be an absolutely marvelous little gem (and one that we will be writing a review for in just a bit!).While we may not have a good comparision as Madi is the first concierge we've ever sought help from, we have no doubt that she is the best option for anyone who needs help planning a visit to Argentina. Whether it to check out an apartment or organise your trip as a whole, she has devoted a lot of time to understanding Buenos Aires and Argentina and uses this knowledge to provide a top quality service. What we liked most about her was that at no point in time did we feel pressured to choose \"her option\". She always presented each option in equally good and poor light, and while she expressed her personal ideas on which options may be better, it was done tastefully, and with enough breathing room for us to come to our own decision.Finally, BA Cultural Concierge's services are also very good value for money. Both the apartment hunt and the estancia arrangement were organised for us at a sum that we felt was more than reasonable.We highly recommend BA Cultural Concierge and Madi Lang for any Argentina related travel assistance. A double recommendation if your Spanish is weak or non-existent!"

She helped me figure out what I wanted to see, arranged an airport transfer with this georgeous guy (not necessary but very nice), and was overall welcoming. The first day we walked for 4 hours, San Telmo, Recoletta, took the old subway car, and had lunch. Walking back to the hotel I tripped. Blood was down my slacks. She went with me to the hotel, where I was bandaged, and took me to the German Hospital. She stayed with me the entire time and tranaslated. Nothing broken but I needed stitches. The hospital wouldn't accept my credit card without a passport and I had minimal cash. Madi went back to my hotel and retrieved my passport. After the hospital she shepherded me to a brace store and helped procure a brace for my leg. Canceallaiton of remainder of tours.Madi called that night to see if I was OK, and had another georgeous guy stop by the next day to make sure I was fine. She had given him a book and an Argentinian book of photos to give to me.The third day Madi came back to the hotel, picked me up and got a cab, taking me back to the German Hospital for a look-see at my knee. Again, she did this on her own time despite my protestations.When I returned home I received a message from her just checking.I can only hope others meet Madi Lan, truly an exceptional human being. Without her presence, my time in Buenos Aires would have been scary. I recommend her to a visitor without exception. I cannot wait to return to BA, and reconncect with her.Marcia"

Both of the gents are 80ish, have mobility problems, and neither speaks much Spanish. Having never been to Buenos Aires, I wanted someone familiar with the city to assist with planning. I found an ad for BA Cultural Concierge on Landingpad BA, and I went to their website. The proprietor of BA Cultural Concierge is Madi Lang, a native of Maryland, who's been living in, writing about, and sharing Buenos Aires the last several years. It was evident from Madi's website that she could provide all of the services necessary ( planning, transfers, reservations, tours, errands, accompaniment...even gift baskets! ) to make the boys' Buenos Aires visit as enjoyable, enriching, and stress-free as possible. Plus, the website has links to some of Madi's interesting and well-written articles on a variety of Buenos Aires topics. I was very intrigued after perusing the website and reading the articles, so I e-mailed a lengthy initial inquiry to Madi. The next day, I received a pleasant and very detailed reply from Madi's intern, Emily. Emily provided clear, well thought out answers to my questions, and had some good questions for me. I felt very comfortable leaving the Buenos Aires arrangements to Ba Cultural Concierge.Madi and Emily ended up arranging most of the airport and cruise pier transfers, a tango show at Cafe Tortoni, a day trip to an estancia, a walking tour of the Recoleta neighborhood where the hotel was located, a tour of the beautiful Recoleta Cemetery, a city tour in an air-conditioned van, a Sunday brunch at the Alvear Palace Hotel, a Sunday afternoon at the San Telmo street fair, and a \"cafe chat\" with a local economist who discussed Argentina's economy, culture, and history. The ladies also put together a beautiful gift box chock full of Argentinean treats! Best of all, per my request, one or both of the ladies was available to provide accompaniment to all of the above activities. Sadly, my Uncle had to back out of the trip the week before departure, but, luckily, I was available to be his substitute. I feel very fortunate to have been able to spend a few weeks of quality time with Dad, go on a spectacular South America/Antartica cruise, and hang out with Madi and Emily in Buenos Aires. The ladies did a fantastic job of planning and executing all of our Buenos Aires activities. Everything went off without a hitch. Madi and Emily are both knowledgable, caring, full of cheer and good humor, and Dad and I truly enjoyed our time with them."

The architectural beauty of this \"French\" inspired city will leave you wanting more. Jimena was so delightful. She gave a very fun and educational tour of Retiro and Recoleta which started at the San Martin statue. Her insight into the \"aristocracy\" really helped make you understand the history of Buenos Aires and Argentina. Don't miss Gran Gomero which is so old and so heavy that Atlas helps to hold it up and the ultimate architectural revenge, the Kavanagh building.Make sure to tip these guides. They are amazing."

We left the tour at Plaza de Mayo feeling dissapointed, as we had expected to engage with a factual and well-presented history lesson of my country.

It takes about 2 1/2 hours and the pace is relaxed, so no one in our group felt it was demanding. Keep in mind that you are only seeing a few major sites in the central BA. I followed up with a private tour of BA, in order to see the key sites located in other parts of BA, such as Recoleta cemetery. Most important advice is, avoid the hop on hop off bus tour. I would not bother with this, even if it was free."

She was very expressive in her stories and was very knowledgeable being able to answer any questions. Her english was the best of anyone I spoke to on my entire south america trip. The afternoon tour only had one other person. There was some light rain but overall not bad. Some of the sites are ones I would have never thought of visiting but everything fit together. In the morning there were 3 other people. Light rain also but very windy. By the end, every inch of my body was soaking wet and I was freezing. This tour was more historic. Both tours were great though. I think I found the afternoon tour a little more interesting with all the great stories (and better weather). My only criticism would be that the website isnt too clear. I think people mix up this tour with BA Free walks alot. Overall, I was very impressed with Jimena's enthusiasm and passion especially with the weather and so few people. I'd definitely recommend this tour to anyone, maybe in better weather.."

When we turndup it turned out it was only the two of us that day - which meant we really got the most out of it. Although Chris had only lived in BA 9 months he was able to answer all our questions about Argentinien history, architecture, and more, I was truly impressed. So yes- I sincerely recommend this tour!!"

The tour lasted approximately 2 hours and they gave a great in depth discussion about the history, stories and myths about the various locations and buildings. They answered everyone's questions and were overall incredibly enthusiastic and friendly. I went to both the morning and afternoon tours. There is, however, one thing though, I would like to point. During the afternoon tour the guide talked about the Falkland war between Argentina and Great Britain. There was a bit of information that was incorrect and would like to have this changed so that wrong historical facts are not disseminated. They claimed that it took the British 2 months to get to the islands and they fought for 10 days. In actuality it took the British close to 2 weeks to get to the islands and they fought for about 6 weeks. The guide also claimed that the people fighting for Argentina were kids that were not well equipped, but from reading about this war...the people sent from Argentina to fight this battle were the special forces and the army...so kind of, a little misinformation. I understand that many Argentinians died and it was super tragic...but being a history buff, I like the information to be accurate also...otherwise a fantastic tour and we loved every minute of it!"

The guide (we didn't catch his name but it wasn't Martin or Fernando, who are often mentioned by others) was knowledgeable and shared interesting personal insights and experiences. Unfortunately, he tends to speak quickly and with a fairly strong accent, so some of the people in our group who don't speak English as their first language had a hard time understanding him. He was also a bit long-winded at times. We could have covered more sights if the commentary at each stop were shortened a bit. Overall, very good but room for improvement."

As someone who grew up in the city, he could give the best insight on what the locals do and why.And, yes, while it's called \"Free Tour\", they are hoping to earn some tips but there is no pressure whatsoever or \"suggested donation amount\" mentioned - you're free to give any tips or none and you don't have to show how much you give."

We did the morning one which deals with history and architecture as well as other things. They also,offer another at 5 pm. Victoria was informative and had a good sense of humour. Her English is excellent and since there were only the 2 of us we were able to ask any questions we wanted. We did not even book the tour and although it had rained it still went ahead, and they will do this. After the tour we retraced part of our tour and then went to the Cathederal which is worth a visit and is only about 10 minutes from where the tour ends.The tour is free but guides get by on tips and it is up to you what you pay.Would thoroughly recommend this as a different way to see the city rather than a hop on hop off bus trip."

One thing I will say is that please keep in mind since the tour is a free tour, the guides rely on the tips. We felt pretty embarrassed for the people who seemingly love the tour and only gave 10-20 pesos which is the equilvant of less than a few dollars for a fun couple of hours. That is my only negative about the experience. But the tour is great, must do!"

This company runs two daily tours, one in the morning which focuses on key areas of downtown BA and the afternoon tour which concentrates on architecture and aristocracy. However, don't be fooled, these tours are so much more than just the basics. The guides offer passionate and unbiased views on their city, from the good to the bad. They talked us through the history, the economy and the people of not only BA but Argentina. Also, unlike other \"free\" walking tours that we have taken in South America, this tour does not stop off at any local vendors where you feel obliged to buy \"artisan products\". If you have limited time in this amazing city then trust me, there is no better way to spend it than on a BA Free Walking Tour. You will get so much out of it! (Thanks Maggie & Sol)TOP TIP: If you are in BA for a few days then make this tour your first port of call as the tips and advice offered by the guides will help inform you on what to do and see in BA."

My husband and I initially wanted to do the free tours but then we had just two and a half days in Buenos Aires and decided to do a private tour so that we could see much more. And we were so happy we took that decision. I booked our private tour on their website. You have to pay only 100 USD as deposit via paypal and the rest in cash when you meet your guide. We did two tours with them. A whole day city tour (190 USD) on the first day and Tigre Delta (230 USD) on the second. The price includes transportation by local bus and train, entries, Tigre city tour by bus and the boat ride) I corresponded with Adriana who was very prompt in her replies and she was our guide too! She was simply fantastic! She knew the city inside out and was extremely knowledgeable about Argentina's history and politics and culture. She gave us so many insights into the country's past and current affairs. She was a walking talking encyclopaedia on Argentina. She took very good care of us and made sure we were always safe and cautious on the bus and while crossing the street. She gave us great tips on everything and we shared a lot of warm conversations. Our city tour lasted for more than 6 hours and we visited so many neighbourhoods and almost all the main attractions. She told us to visit the Pink House on our last free day as weekend tours are free and open to the public which was a great recommendation! We enjoyed our Tigre Delta tour with her too. She took us by train and then we did a one house bus tour of Tigre before we go on the boat. We had lunch at a restaurant called El Hornero which was great. The boat ride was great and we go to see the beautiful houses and witness their way of life on the delta. Adriana also helped us exchange USD and gave us a good rate. She also helped us save money on our airport transfer. We had booked our airport drop off through our hotel which turned out to be very expensive and she recommended taking a standard taxi instead which was wonderful as it was half the price! We are so happy we did the private walking tour with BA Free Tours. We highly recommend it!"

I wasn't willing to risk another hour to find out. We went on the morning tour with Maggie / Magdalena. She was very sweet, enthusiastic and clearly very passionate about BA. Ultimately the content was lacking and the style was probably best suited to children under 12yo. Maybe we have been spoilt by excellent free walking tours in Santiago, Chile and Medell\u00edn, Colombia, but there were a number of let downs. The background history of BA seemed to be totally missed - when was it founded, why is it the capital, when and how was Argentina formed? You don't need an extensive history lesson, but you could quickly cover the above in 2-3 mins to help frame the tour. One of the rooms in the Congress was painted pink after Evita - who was she? Perron's wife, right? Well who was he and why is he any more important than any other President? Instead we had what felt like 15mins on the Porteno names for coffee - interesting, but probably something that can be covered in a couple of minutes more as a side note. Somewhat confusingly we were let into \"big secrets\" which ended up being things such as the widest avenue not actually being the widest avenue... rather than say, burying potical opponents under the freeway during its construction. The anecdote about the avenue also seemed to take an eternity.All very odd. Maybe the afternoon one is better. It's really sad to see some of the less positive reviews say things to the effect, \"maybe BA just doesn't have that much that's interesting\". I was lucky enough to have an excellent high end private tour in the past (which I obviously didn't expect to be the same) but I can assure people that BA has an incredible culture and history. Definitely would not recommend."

And i know it is repeated a thousand times but wear comfy shoes and take sunscreen and water.

This 5 pm tour with Vicky introduced us to it all- never getting too in depth (which was a bit of a shame, but with so much to see and learn, it makes sense), we learned the general history of the city from Argentina's liberation by San Martin, the glorious years at the start of the 20th Century, all the way to the economic crisis still affecting the city today. Recoleta is a beautiful neighborhood, and Vicky was a fun and enthusiastic guide, making it easy for everyone in our large group of 15 people to feel included and get something out of the tour.Highly recommended!!"

You won't be overwhelmed with information, but get just the right amount.

Other tours we have been on have perhaps shown you more of the culture of the city, taking you to taste local foods and drinks which have added another dimension to the tour. We have found they have been historic tours with a splash of culture and a difference to make it that little bit more interesting and entertaining.

We took the Aristocrat Tour which covered many areas in Retiro and Recoleta. Our tour guide Vicky was poised, knowledgeable and very eager to share the history of BA. Our walk was two hours and was well paced. We went by many home and European style buildings that I would have just passed by if I was just a regular tourist walking down the street. The last stop did scare the heck out me---the myths and supposed facts of Eva Peron were discussed. I am glad to know them but it was a damper that we left on that note. Thanks for a wonderful free walking tour. I highly recommend tipping these awesome guides!"

They were both very knowledgable and enthusiastic and their English was flawless.The tours are a really good orientation around key sights and a primer on the basic history of Argentina. They are interactive - with the guides happy to answer questions frankly about anything at all and are not constrained by time - so the tours lasted more than the nominated 2-2.5 hours.So nice to get out in the sunshine and do these tours; much better than sitting on some bus, listening to a recorded explanation.Five stars - and strongly recommended."

It was most enjoyable and I will recommend it to anyone."

These free tours are EXCELLENT and very well organized.The guides are fluent in English and locals (usually arts, history, human sciences students). There are two different tour, with different focus: the morning one is more focused on historical places and politics. It is very interesting to be able to understand several aspects of Argentinean history. The evening tour is more \"cultural\"; they talk about their life style, curiosities about buildings, architecture, famous people, points of view. It is VERY interesting. Make sure you do at least one of these tours during the first days of your trip. It will give you a very general view about what is interesting (or not!) for you to see and eventually spend more time visiting later. Also, they can provide you extra tips/suggestions about other places to visit, restaurants to try, etc. It is like having an argentinean friend for few hours. :)Th tour is free, but if you can, pay them tip. It is very appreciate and it is a nice way to keep them motivated to provide us this great \"service\".ps. apparently there are many cities around the world with these \"free tours\". Keep on eye on that!"

Both guides spoke excellent English and were friendly, funny and easy to approach with questions etc.The concept of going on a free tour is excellent, because the guide really tries to be as engaging and entertaining as possible to earn a good tip at the end. The total lack of obligation to tip, and the emphasis that you should only pay what you can afford, makes this a stress free experience, and one in which you can get local insight into the history and monuments of Buenos Aries. The morning tour is more political and focuses on El Centro, and the afternoon tour is more cultural and takes you around the fancy neighborhood of Recoletta. I would strongly recommend both!"

We will be here for a couple of weeks but wanted to get a local perspective. The 11:00am tour focuses on the area from Plaza Congresso to the Presidential Palace, the \"pink house\". Our guide, Magdalena was very energetic and enthusiastic. She provided good information about the main sights and good perspective on \"porte\u00f1os\" and life in BA. The guide will point out that \"free\" means that you can pay the guide based upon the value you perceive. What other service provider does that? Gives you the tour and then allows you to pay what you think it is worth. If you can make the time, this tour is well worth setting aside 3 hours."

Victoria is a fantastic guide, very knowledgeable and smiley.

There is a second tour in the evening I would have loved to do but we just cannot fit it in. Finally remember this is the tour guide's job so please do tip if you enjoy it.

            "review": "Interesting and informative tour, and you tip what you will!. I decided to try this tour based off of reviews from here, and wasn't disappointed. I first did the morning tour with Gaston, and liked it so much that I decided to do the evening tour the same day with Victoria. The morning tour goes more into the history and politics and the afternoon gets more into the culture. Both tour guides are excellent and know what they are talking about. They are friendly and able to provide the information in an interesting way.I only have a couple of other comments. Although Gaston says that he will wait for people to take pictures and cross streets, he seems to continue on without noticing when group members get caught up. That being said, the pace is slow enough that as long as you don't lose sight of the group, you won't get lost. Victoria was much better about waiting for everyone, and I found that more relaxing as I didn't have to worry about hurrying to catch up. Some small tidbits in each tour were the same, but it was more for a contextual basis on what each specific group was talking about, so it was warranted and didn't feel repetitive. At the end of Gaston's tour he teaches how to talk with your hands which I found interesting, and helpful. After that, I began to notice everyone doing the same signs that he showed! Victoria tells some interesting stories about families that used to live in the magnificent palaces you'll see along the tour. The afternoon tour also is a little shorter in length and you don't walk as far, so keep that in mind.Overall, both tours were excellent and well worth the time. And since you can tip what you want, you decide how much the tours were worth!"

The tour with Gaston seemed contain a large amount of his biased view of the Argentinean political system rather than substance for a city tour. Victoria was friendly but provided different answer to that of Gaston's when asked about the protesters in front of the presidential palace. Both tours talked about the thousands of people kidnapped during the military dictatorship and the tour with Victoria mentioned the Jewish memorial, however both tours failed to even mention what happened to the African slaves which at one point consisted of one third of the Buenos Aires population; a pretty significant piece of history I would think to at least deserved a mention."

The three hours passes quickly as you are regalled with stories of history, politics and just plain fun about this great city. When they started by asking us to say our name and what city we were from we thought it was a bit hokey but were quickly interested at the broad range of people we were walking with. The 'free' part of this should involve a voluntary donation of around $US20 but that is up to you. We thought it was well worth the cost. Look for a small crowd and their distinctive green shirts at the meeting points."

Although they say Recoletta Cemetery is one of the stops, it is closed by the time you get there and the guide just briefly talked about it when we were standing in front of a nearby church.Overall, I would recommend both tours as a starting point when you first come to Buenos Aires and if you have the time, go back to each of the stops and spend more time exploring. At the end of the tours, there was no pressure to give a tip from either of the guides.I have heard that sometimes there can be a lot of people on the tours but we were lucky to have been in fairly small groups for both tours."

The tour was scheduled for 11. We actually did not leave til after 11:25. It was hot out that day and those of us who were on time, or early, had to stand out in the sun and wait for another 25 minutes. That is not pleasant. I believe that if you say you start at 11, then please do as you say. if not, let your guests know there is always a delay. The tour lasted for 3 hours. It could and should be about a 2 hour tour. At least 1 hour was spent on self promotion. Again it was hot out and we stood in the sun listening to our guide talk about himself and not the history or sights of architecture we were seeing. We have been traveling in South America for 2 months and this was by far the weakest city tour we have been on. Juan the tour guide had quite a good sense of humor and he knew his stuff. But he always was very full of himself, thought he was terrific, and told us constantly how good he and his company was. He also dropped the [--] bomb several times. Now I myself use that word. But I saw how uncomfortable this was for many of the people in the group. There we people of many different ethnicities there. This not how a proud Porteno should conduct himself. This tour may be \"free\", but I would rather pay for some professionalism than stand in the hot sun listening to a stand up night club comedy act. I do hope the tour people take some notice here. This could be a fabulous experience."

Aside from the cultural information she gave us, she armed us with tons of useful practical information re: where to go and how to make the best of our time in BA. It is easy to see she is passionate about the city and enjoys sharing it with visitors. We felt like we had made a friend! The tour was so good we made sure we went to the morning tour with Gaston the following morning. This was a more historical view of BA and really put everything into context for us. I cannot recommend these tours highly enough, if nothing else its so nice to meet up with a group of people and get some local insight into the city. Also becasue the tours focus on point out the features of BA rather than visiting attractions in detail, it allows you pick and choose what you wish to visit later on in more detail. An invaluable experience at the beginning of your trip! Thanks so much again Sol! Rach & Andy"

Shepherding a group of English speaking strangers through Recoleta, within minutes she had memorized everyone's name, quite a feat. The pace of the tour could be characterized as leisurely, and as other e viewers have indicated this is a combination of history and culture with some current culture throw in. Sol was very entertaining and truly shows her love of country, we tipped in US dollars which I think was preferred,"

She gave many sideinfos and went with us to one of the best pizza-places in the Baires after the tour. Highly recommended, its very good to go there in the first days of your visit and you will get many usefull informations like safety, fake money, trips, how to safe money, up-to-date event infos, political information aso.

The info was communicated in a fun way, often with sarcasm and jokes. I took both tours - morning and afternoon. Once I had it with Sol, another time with Gaston. Both were really good and entertaining. Personally I prefered the one with Sol because of the tour agenda. The afternoon tour covers less know buildings, facts. The morning to me was quite obvious as I already lived in B.A. for few months and had seen the points of interest by myself as they are the most popular attractions - Casa Rosada, Catedral, Palacio Barolo etc. I recommend taking the morning tour as soon as you arrive, the second tour as a second. And do not forget to tip, that's how they can do this for you."

Best bits were learning about how to order coffee in BA, e.g. the difference between a lagrima (3/4 milk and a \u00bc coffee) and a jallista (?) which is the other way around, and a cortado (an espresso) and the word for a cappuccino which I have now forgotten! I also liked getting the bits of recent history about the veterans from the Malvinas/Falklands war who were on hunger strike outside the presidents palace to claim their unpaid wages, and the condom over the obelisk story. Nicely done!

She was passionate about her subject and very informative - not just about the historical stuff but also personal information that only a local would know. Hey - walking through the \"plastic surgeon\" part of town we got to see some pretty wild \"fixed faces\". Just not very happy that the tour ended at 8pm, in the dark, out by Recoleta cemetery - our only way home was by taxi. The 11am city tour with Gaston was OK but he seemed to be having a better time than the group. Everything was delivered with a funny/clever line when actually most of what we needed were the facts. It was a big group so maybe a little difficult to keep us all interested. Two days earlier we had walked the same walk with a different \"free tour\" which hands down was 100% better. Same walking distance but much more information delivered in a much more professional, interesting way. The tour says they are free - therefore it is not acceptable in our opinion to hear Gaston saying/laughing that 100 pesos would be an amount to give. That said - we defy you to walk away without giving anything. They say: \"spread the word\" - they also mean: \"give us the peso\""

I wandered towards the appointed meeting place and was amazed to see people just rocking up to a sign in the middle of the plaza del congreso, on time!! We all shook hands and introduced ourselves and were off on an amazing walk with Virginia (Vir, like beer) as our guide. All of a sudden the mysteries of the city I had felt quite alone in for the past week were opened up. I at last found out how to order the right coffee ( a jarita as opposed to a lagrima or cafe con leche), what a submarina was (something yummy to do with chocolate!), where parliament went during the revolution (the coffee shop of course!) and was totally blown away by the story of the abuellas de la plaza de mayo, who still walk every Thursday at 3pm. Thank you for sharing the stories of your amazing city Virginia!! I thoroughly recommend this walk and can't wait to return another day to find out more!!"

We did both tours (downtown/central Buenos Aires & Recoleta/Retiro), and they were indeed some of the most fun and entertaining hours we had in the city. We were lucky enough to have Gaston as our guide. He has a great sense of humor, which made the tour really fun as well as really interesting. The pace of the walks was pretty leisurely, and Gaston answered all questions. He also asked the group questions to get people talking and involved. I felt that we got a better perspective on the city's history here than in some of the museums, and that Gaston's company is a very good ambassador for the city to us English speakers. This is a free tour, so no one is obligated to pay; or you just can tip the guides what you can. However, I would value the service being provided for each 2-3 hour personally guided tour at least at 100 pesos ($20-$25 US). I would certainly have bought a ticket for such a tour for this amount, and I would have felt it was a really good value. One other benefit of the tours was being able to meet other tourists who were in town. We kept bumping into the same people during our visit, which was also fun."

Our guide, Virginia, was very good about explaining the different aspects of typical BA life, showing us the major sites and giving us information about the political background that has shaped the lives of Portenos over the years. At times, she was a little animated, which is probably better than being dull, but it felt a bit over the top for my wife and I. Overall, highly recommend the tour as it is an easy way to see the city, get information that you wouldn't typically get from guidebooks, and obviously very reasonable even with the tip at the end. I would recommend doing this early in your visit as it gets you used to the parts of the city, and is a good venue for asking questions about what to do in BA. Good overview of the city and very knowledgeable tour guides."

I especially commend her for making our group feel comfortable---with people from all different countries, she made us all welcome and it was a pleasure to get to know them as we strolled along. Another plus was that we were encouraged to ask her any questions (unlike other tours I've taken when you feel like you shouldn't interrupt the guide). This tour gave us a good overview of the city and it was beneficial to orient ourselves. There was also a 15 minute stop where you can grab a cup of coffee or use the restrooms which I thought was convenient. We were sorry when it was over!"

My husband and I are not big tour people, but we read such good things about BA Free Tours on Tripadvisor that we decided to try it this past week. We started with Juan for the morning tour and had a great experience. He was extremely knowledgeable as well as personable. He presented a lot of very interesting history and added information about Argentinian culture as well. His \"chamuzo\" kept us all involved with the tour from start to finish. I was so interested in some of the history after hearing Juan that I bought two autobiographies on the Dirty War that night. We actually ran into Juan with another tour group two days later and joined them for coffee. We had a two-hour discussion of philosophy, literature, and culture that can't be found in a tour book or on a tour bus.Because we enjoyed Juan's tour so much, we did the afternoon tour as well with Sol as our guide. Again, we had a wonderful experience as Sol really knew her stuff. She showed us the Recoleta neighborhood in great detail all while adding in more cultural information that was fascinating. We continued to \"look for lions\" all over town after that tour.We highly recommend the BA Free Tour! They are at the meeting places in their bright green hoodies rain or shine - and we know that for a fact since the second day we ran into Juan with the other group, it had been raining all day. The four people in that group said that they figured he wouldn't show up, but they were wrong. Reliable, interesting, and fun - what more could you ask for?"

My and my boyfriend took both free tours: the morning one through the city center and the one in the afternoon though the Recoleta neighbourhood. It was a great way of getting to know the city, the Argentinian culture, the habits of the people. Both guides were local youngsters, which gave us the feeling we were really getting a local perspective, and were very knowledgeable about the history of Argentina and the monuments in Buenos Aires. They made their best to be very engaging, by telling jokes and making personal comments, and to make the visit as interactive as possible, by posing questions to the tourists and encouraging them to do the same. Personally I prefer low-profile guides, who state the facts and leave all the judgment up to myself, but still I enjoyed the guides and both trips!A tip on how to find the guides: they wear bright green hoodies with black letters on their back."

We might have seen everything on the list but the following attractions were never talked about Calle Florida, Manzana de las Luces, Cabildo, Estacion Peru and Teatro Colon.

We went on Gaston's morning tour that starts at the Congress building on our first morning in BA. The tour lasted around 3 hours and he took us all around the Centro area, visiting the Congress building, Avenida de Mayo, Casa Rosada, Cafe Tortoni, Peru Station, Calle Florida and ending at the Obelisk. Gaston was a fantastic tour guide. He is a porteno who also spent some time living in the States. His passion for his city is contagious and he gave us a great historical background of the city and its culture. The tour also was a great way to get a feel for the city and its geography. Gaston is one of the owners of BA Free Tour and he gave us lots of suggestions of other things to do in the city and offered help planning. We had such a great experience that we decided to go on the 5pm Recoleta tour and had Sol as our guide. This tour explores a different area of BA and Sol was just as phenomenal as Gaston. She gave a great context for everything we saw (San Martin monument, Malvinas/Falklands Memorial, British clock tower, embassies in Recoleta) and what it means to Argentinians today. These two tours together made for a great start to our trip and gave us solid bearings on the city. I cannot recommend it any higher. These tours are so worth it!"

We were met promptly at 11 a.m. by Gaston, our guide. His love and enthusiasm for the city where he was born and raised was contagious. He shared the history and culture of the city on many different levels and would answer ANY question that you might have. He said that if he did not know the answer, he would look it up, but he never had to because he knows his stuff. We had such a great time that we decided to do the second tour of the Recoleta neighborhood later in the day. Again, we were not disappointed. Daniela, our guide, was just as professional and enthusasitic as Gaston and had all the answers. She was even quite the dipolmat when she thought I was asking her about her opinion of the current President - where I was really asking about the general country's feelings. Our one suggestion with this tour might be to bump up the start time a little as we finished in the dark. We would highly recommend these tours.

It focuses on the historic sector centre part of the city, National Congresso down Avenida de Mayo (finishing at the Oblesik). The best part is Gaston's knowledge and the insight you get to Argentina today, plus history and how Portenos live - plus he can give you tips on Tango shows etc."

I can't remember the name of the guide on the afternoon tour but Gaston was who I toured with in the morning. They take their time, and know the answers to all of your questions. They are so helpful and friendly and even let me talk about the Dirty War when questions came up about it. They love their job and work very hard for their tips. I can't imagine a more in depth and awesome tour. Every city in the world needs to establish this! Genius!"

We recommend you to take this tour and walk around this loving tourist guides and enjoy their information and tour. Don't forget to tip because even though it does not have. price is not free!!!

Sol explained a lot on how portenos think and their culture and customs. I recommend this tour to anyone traveling to Buenos Aires. It is also worth taking a tour in Buenos Aires because there is so much history there and influences the way the entire city is. You basically tip Sol how much you want-- she recommends 50 pesos per person which I think is a very fair rate!"

This tour runs from the congress square along Avenida de Mayo to the Plaza de Mayo, then back up to the Obelisk. This seems a short route but still takes 2-2.5 hrs as there are a number of stops along the route where the guide (I had Gaston) gives a very thorough and entertaining explanation of the history and current uses of the sights. Overall an excellent tour with a good and entertaing fuide that had all thr knowledge abd was able to answer a whole number of quedtions from the group. Expect to tip only what you can afford - there is no hidden \"mandatory\" charge but it would be rude not to for such a great tour.A couple of notes on the meeting point, tour begin at 11am in the congress square, but it does not begin from directly outside the congress building. Instead the meeting point is along the right of the large gated monument opposite the congress building when you are facing the congress building itself. Look for a guide in a green T-Shirt."

We learned quite a bit about the history of the country, city, and its people and government. We took a 45 minute break outside the President's house, and the only thing I would suggest BAFT change would be to increase the break time and allow/encourage participants to tour the President's house (if on a weekend) and/or the Cathedral before regrouping and leaving the area. Either that, or rearrange to have the tour end there so people can explore it on their own time.We tipped generously and would encourage others to do so if they enjoy the tour."

They showed us the usual city info plus shopping tips (but not stop and shop), local interest, history, gossip, and funny facts. Gaston also gave us his email address so we could ask questions about BA during our stay, which we did and his answers were helpful. Having a local resource, other than the tourist bureau is useful.I have to admit we probably tipped our lovely guides close to what we would have paid for a commercial tour, but two points on that; we did it because we thought it was extra good value (not because we were pressured) and the initial premise is; pay what you think the tour is worth & what you can afford, and if you can't afford much they are good with that.Enjoy BA it's a great place."

Walking is a perfect way to explore and get to know the city, but the usual warnings about the elements apply - it was 32 degrees Celsius when I went.There are no charges for either of the tours, you are encouraged to tip the guides as a sign of appreciation - the recommended amount was 50 Pesos (about US$11 at the time of writing) but there was absolutely no pressure to pay anything if you didn't want to or could not afford to.All in all - well worth it.

The 2 guides both have great knowlegde of the city and we especially appreciated hearing about the people who leave in BA. A very professional tour. If you have the time - go for it. Both tours last about 2.5 hour and the walking distance is easy. Don't forget to tip at the end of the tour!!!! they deserve it."

Gaston & Sol were fantastic, we all learnt so much. We had 2 kids 9 & 12 which were never bored, they always included them. They answered our questions, gave advise and helped guide us so we had a safe & enjoyable experience in BA. We also brought tickets to a Boca game to give the kids (& us) an amazing experience. We were not disappointed. Unfortunately though we had problems with the kids tickets, when I contacted Gaston he was amazing and Sol personally delivered a refund to our hotel. I highly recommend both Gaston & Sol's walking tours & the soccer game. It's nice to know you can trust someone when you are away from home in a strange country."

We joined both tours on the same day. The day tour was led by Gaston who was friendly and humorous. He speaks pretty loud, so you should be able to hear him very well on the busy streets. Gaston told us interesting stories/history about different buildings and areas. We also joined the evening tour and met Sol. We were so lucky that no other people were joining us, so it was a \"private\" walking tour for us. Sol was super nice and sweet and helped us take many good photos. She was very familiar with the area and told us interesting stories/history too. She also recommended to us a very good restaurant (La Cabrera) for dinner. We enjoyed the tours very much!

At my recent visit to Buenos Aires I made both walking tours in a single day - this is the way to be done as the two are really complementary. Overall, excellent indeed - in the morning with Virginia, visiting the main attractions in the central area and listening to the history of Argentina, its psychology, social structure, etc., in the afternoon with Sol going to the aristocratic part of BA. Both girls with a lot of info, different characters but so charming. Learned very much about Argentina - things you cannot find in the books. The two groups were quite big, each about 30-40 persons (mostly from US, Australia, less from Europe) - and among them there were some very interesting people as well. The second group finished with a good cup of beer in a resto close to Recoleta cemetery. Lovely, and highly recommended."

Each tour gives you a great overview of the main (and some not so main) historical sites in BA. Afterwards you'll know where everything is if you want to go back to spend more time. The history and information the guides tell are great, and they come from a local's perspective. Sol's description of the war in the Malvinas/Falkland islands was great because it gave me a better understanding of the view from an Argentinian. Walking around, seeing the cities highlights without a guide of some kind is like looking at a nice picture book with no captions. You're only getting half of the story. Having the other half of the story told from a local's perspective really enhances the experience, and taking these tours is a must do no matter how much or little time you have in BA. Note: be sure to schedule some time to see the Recoleta Cemetary other than after the evening tour as it will be closed by the time you get there."

I'd highly recommend it to anyone new to Buenos Aires. I have been there before but had really very little knowledge about the place, other than the fleeting association with Parilla, lomo, vino and Tango. Of course we have all heard of Eva Peron, but there was so much else to learn of the history of the place and the politics of the past 200 or so years since independence, ably re-told by the very knowledgeable porte\u00f1os and what better way than to see the splendour of the city and its famous monuments and palaces at street level, all taken in whilst walking along its grand city grid and while negotiating the weekday traffic, both vehicular and human! The porte\u00f1os rely on tips (which they gamely say is optional, because they are advertised as being free), but these tours are well worth more than the price of a commercial tour and I do not believe that there would be anyone mean-spirited enough not to repay their splendid efforts!"

Morning tour had emphasis on political history, and afternoon tour talked more about the influential families of BA's past. I appreciated getting information from a local who was consistently able to express and explain events from more than one perspective. After each tour I was inspired to learn more on my own about the events and sites covered. It was also a great way to meet fellow travelers and learn a lot from what they had been doing in the city.Gaston was informative, friendly and entertaining. No pressure to tip (although I highly recommend you give as much as you can afford because it's worth it!) and certainly the tours were not in any way an attempt to sell any other product or service. Each tour lasted between 2-3 hrs . Buenos Aires Free Tours are, as many others have indicated, a must do for any trip to BA."

We had been walking around and exploring for a few days already, but she pointed out interesting bits we had missed. Sol led the afternoon tour we took and very passionately described the history, the politics, and the sights in Recoleta. These are not your typical guides with pre-selected sets of facts and figures. They are real Portenos, who are clearly excited to show you their city. There is absolutely no pressure to tip (in fact, I think they should sell their services more aggressively). We definitely recommend taking the tours even if you think you have seen it all. You will certainly learn something that is not in any guidebook."

Each tour is about 2 - 2.5 hours, but the time goes fast.There is not a fee for the tour, they work on tips.The tours are in English and you get to meet other English speaking tourists (and compare notes about the good/bad of BA).I highly recommend making this one of your first stops in BA so that you can use your knowledge for the rest of your stay.

Their recommendations range from super turista to super local. All the food recommendations we got were SPOT on and so well-priced. They went above and beyond to learn the interests of my group and would point out certain spots that they knew would have particular appeal.I cannot recommend anything in BA more than BA Free Tours!"

I did this tour previously 2 years ago with some friends who came to visit and loved it, so when my girlfriend came down to visit Buenos Aires we once again did this. There are two tours - the historical and 'aristocratic' one which look at the oldest part of the city where all the government houses are located and one of the most expensive neighborhoods which look mainly into the Argentine culture. Both are great, but if you only have time for one I would chose the later - because I think this one gives you a greater feel for what the Argentine culture is. Anyways, the tour is very informative and the guides very charismatic. Even as a local I still was able to learn quite a deal about my own city so I think for tourists there will be an even greater payoff. As far as bang for the buck is concerned, this is the best tour in town."

There's 2 tours on offer, a city tour in the morning which meets at the Plaza del Congreso and an afternoon tour of aristocratic Beunos Aires which meets at Plaza San Martin. The meeting point board is easy to spot (as is the guide with his green top on)!My friend and I did the morning tour. It was a good introduction to BA. We covered the obelisk, Av. de Mayo, Av. 9 de Julio, Teatro Colon, Plaza to Mayo and more that I can't even remember now. It was relaxed and easy going, stopping for a 15 minute break inbetween. We spent about 3 to 3.5 hours on the tour.We went on a Friday, we bumped into our guide on the Saturday whilst he was doing the tour and there was double the amount of people on that tour, so if you can, do a weekday."

It was really interesting, he had tons of fun facts and stories about the buildings, the culture and the county in general. He knows the opening and closing hours of every important building, and the prices for visits... Thanks to him, we saw a wonderful tango show for only 50pesos, while our hostel told us the cheapest tango show costed 140pesos.I highly recommend this tour. If you do it, be sure to bring a couple of pesos to thank him. And if you're planning to go there in July or August, dont forget to bring warm clothes (and a notebook to jot down opening and closing hours of each building you'd like to visit)!"

You get to learn facts you would have not known otherwise, in a very fun way. You get to communicate with the locals and ask them all sorts of questions and they are very good with recommendations! They tell you places where you should and should not go from a local point of view and with a history background. I would recommend going on your first day, as they take you to the most touristy places and explain how to get arround the city easier. Totally worth it and great fun!"

            "review": "History and Aristocrats In One Day. Based on Trip Advisor reviews, we decided to take the Buenos Aires Free Tour starting at Congreso. Our guide was Teo and we had a great time with him. As promised, Teo pointed out the major sites, but he added the extra value of his Porteno point of view, including doses of political commentary at appropriate moments. We had a small group of six from the US, Venezuela, Germany, and Australia; and as many have found, we were all friends by the end thanks to Teo's enthusiasm and humor. Teo particularly brought the Plaza de Mayo to life with his firsthand commentary and experience related to las Madres de los Desaparecidos and their marches at the Plaza. This history tour of the Microcentro lasted about 2 1/2 hours starting at 11:00 a.m., so the end of the tour was perfect timing for a lunch break, including the invitation to join Teo after the tour.We headed off in our own direction, enjoying lunch at Los Inmortales (fantastic empanadas) a few blocks from El Obelisco and near Calle Florida. The timing and location of that break was a perfect setup to walk to the afternoon Aristocratic Tour that starts at 5:00 p.m. at Plaza San Martin.Our afternoon tour guide was Sol. She was equal in enthusiasm and humor to Teo, and as anticipated, this tour was a much different point of view. Passing through the luxury neighborhood of Recoleta, we learned much of the culture of wealth in early 20th century Argentina that brought the essence of Paris and European style and architecture to Buenos Aires. Since we toured in June (late autumn), this walk was mostly in the dusk and dark evening, but that made the sites all the more interesting.Overall, the Free Tours were well worth the time and can serve as both an introduction to the city and more in depth experience. Like many of the reviewers here, we tipped about $15.00 per person for each tour - a great value considering that the more impersonal and commercial tours start around $30 per person. These are the perfect tour to take in the first day or two in BA. So meet up with the green sweatshirts and enjoy the walk."

The two offered in BA are both unique and gave me exactly what I wanted - an insiders view on the streets, neighborhoods, history and most importantly, a chance to get some questions answered. I joined the morning tour, it took about 2.5 hours and the guy (can't remember his name) reallly put his heart and soul into it. We were a mix of single travellers and a couple of couples - at the end of it he suggested a good local restaurant and some of us went there as a group. Liking the tour format so much, another traveller I met on the tour and I decided to do the evening one as a few of the others had done that one the night previously. Sol was our guide and it was completely different but equally as good. Again she worked really hard at delivering what the group was interested in. This personal delivery is why these tours work. Good job by both guides - tip them well, they are working really hard to build a company and you won't be disappointed."

They each show different parts of Buenos Aires and I highly recommend you do both! They are casual, fun and you learn a ton! It's also great to connect with other travelers from around the world. The tours lasted about 2 hours and you should have good walking shoes. If you go in May, on the evening tour, bring a jacket b/c it gets a little chilly. They provide a great introduction to the city and also share some good street smart advice for tourists in BA. they give great recommendations for hostels, restaurants, etc. The tours are totally free and then you can tip the guide at the end if you feel they earned it and trust me they will! Just look for the guide in a green shirt/jacket and a bunch of lost tourists gathering together--you'll have a great time--it's totally worth it!

We had read the reviews of this tour on Trip Advisor and decided to try it out.It was very enjoyable and I'd recommend this tour to anyone. We did the evening tour (5pm departure, Aristocratic tour). It began approximately on time. The guide was there early, but she gave people 5-10 minutes to join the group. Our group size was decent (15-20 people) and that is probably the only negative of the tour. The sidewalks on some portions are narrow and people end up spread-out and thus with limited ability to hear the guide. Any major spot, the tour would stop and everyone would gather round to hear, but if you wanted to engage in additional conversation you needed to stay at the front of the group.I wasn't watching the time, but I think the whole thing took a little over 2 hours. thus leaving plenty of time to find a dinner location.One other positive -- since it wasn't clear to me from their website if the tours ran rain or shine, I sent an email the day before we were leaving the US. The Buenos Aires forecast included rain for the day we would be there. Very prompt response to my question -- the answer is the tours are operated rain or shine."

I really enjoyed our tour guide, Gaston, who was very informative and funny. Plus he was not really pushing for tips like the other free tour I attended...he didn't mention once how much we should give.I feel that walking tours are more intimate (better pictures) and more hands on, but walking 2.5 hours can be tiring...so it really is up to the person.

Her sweet and lovely manner are really entrataining, it goes from Plaza San martin, through Retiro and Recoleta.On my own I did not understand all the similarities with Paris, after a while with Cecilia no more doubts... Her father was with her for a walk and added some nice stories to the walk.As we liked the one with Cecilia (and it does not cost 200 pesos per person) we went on the following monday to the other one, with Gaston, the guy who invented the free tour (you give a tip at the end if you want). Talking about politics of your country is always not easy, but he tries to stay as neutral and laid back as possible, making it fairly entrataining... It goes from Plaza del Congreso through all the Avenida de Mayo up to the Casa Rosada...These guys put a lot of hard work in what they do without a guaranteed return, they also offer you free advice on restaurant and attractions in BA...

We learnt a lot about the history of Buenos Aires and Argentina which gave a great insight into the city which otherwise we would not have had. Since we enjoyed the morning tour so much we decided to attend the afternoon tour also which covers a different area of the city. The afternoon tour also lasts approximately 2.5hrs.Both guides were great and were very passionate about their city and also very knowledgeable. Very energetic also! As the tour is free a small tip is expected at the end of each tour however we found this to be no problem considering the information and time the guides are giving.I would advise to have plenty of sunscreen, water and even a hat. Also wear comfortable shoes. There is a lot of walking and particularly when doing both tours in one day...it is quite tiring. We were exhausted by the end as were others in the group who had attended both tours.All in all, it\u00b4s a great way to get your bearings and learn something along the way. Highly recommend!"

There was a group of about 15 of us, and she held our attention really well with her interesting bits of history and funny jokes. We didn't cover a lot of ground, physically, but I felt I learned a lot. She also was really helpful with tips about what else to do and where else to go in Buenos Aires. All in, the tour lasted about 2 hours, I think. For the price (honestly, it's free), you can't beat this tour. The guides work for tips alone, and perhaps this is why they do such a nice job! Thanks, Sol!"

The tours took about 2 hours each, and you don't cover that much distance (maybe 2km.) The tours were really for free. We tipped the tour guides at the end of the tour. Neither tour guide went around the group asking for money. Everyone who wanted to tip had to approach them to say thanks.We did the 5pm tour with Sol starting at the San Martin Plaza. Sol wore a green shirt with the BA Free Tour logo on it and asked all the people that looked like tourists if we were looking for her. Be warned that there are other \"tour guides\" that lurk in the area to lure you to their tours set at different days or times. Sol was very informative and told great stories and answered all the questions that we had about the tour, sites, and Porte\u00f1o way of life. She was very helpful in recommending good restaurants for us as well. We ended the tour at the Recoleta Cemetary. Sorry - by the time we get there, the Cemetary is already closed but Sol did recommend a few things to look for when we got a chance to go in. The 11am tour with Gaston started at the Plaza del Congresso. It was very hot that morning so he waited to make sure that everyone was able to get water, etc. before he started the tour. We recommend doing this tour on Saturday as it ends at the Casa Rosada and you can do a free tour of the government house then."

It was interesting to see people from all over (though mostly from the US), and even a few of the locals were intrigued and joined parts of the tour too. We were sad that we didn't have time to do both tours they offer. Ultimately they do ask for tips if you enjoyed the tour, but there is no real pressure. They certainly deserved a tip too. I don't know what other people give, but we gave 100 pesos for the two of us."

The first one starts daily Monday thru Saturday at Plaza del Congresso at 11 am and the second one starts at 5pm at Plaza San Martin. Both tours are definitely worth doing. The first one is a general tour and gives one a good overview of the Argentine history. As I already mentioned it starts out Plaza del Congresso and ends at the Obelisco. On this walk you will go down the main artery of the city toward the Plaza de Armas and then from there will take side streets to get to the Obelisco. This tour company is operated by two females who primarily operate on tips. Their knowledge on history of the county and the city is quite decent but don\u2019t expect a PhD tour guide. Some information we received was not entirely in line with what we knew about the city and the economy. With that caveat, this tour is totally worth the time. This tour takes about 2.5 \u2013 3hours. The second tour is called the aristocratic Buenos Aires and takes you on a walk through the neighborhood of Recoleta ending at the entrance to the Recoleta cemetery. This tour is packed with history as well. However, it is more geared toward architecture of the city and more precisely what that archetecture used to be like. On this tour you clearly see the European influence on the architecture and you will visit a few mansions that used to belong to private parties and now are owned by either large hotel chains or various embassies. This tour takes about 2 hours and again if you like architecture this is a great way to get to know the Architecture of Buenos Aires."

This tour is well worth to do on your first or second day in Buenos Aires so you can get an overview of the city.Gaston, the tour guide, is very energetic, funny and extremely friendly. He speaks fluent english. He'll take you around the whole downtown of the city and give you an insight of how portenos (people from Buenos Aires) live, think and enjoy life.There are two tours. One is the morning (downtown area) and an afternoon one that is more dedicated to the Recoleta area.We did the morning one. It was very sunny and hot too so if you go to BA in the summer, you must wear a hat (I didn't and burned my scalp!), sunglasses, light clothing, lots of sunscreen and comfortable shoes. The tour takes about 2.5 hours, lots of walking but it actually doesn't feel like it because Gaston was so very entertaining!He even stopped twice on a little convenience store so we were able to get bottled water.It is a free tour but he makes his money out of tips and for a tour like that you would be charged at least $US 25-30 per person somewhere else so keep that in mind when you tip him.Don't even think about taking the double decker bus tour. It is a disaster. This walking tour is 1000000 times better. You actually walk on the streets, see the locals, can take great pictures and will learn things that are not explain on a conventional tour.This tour is for all ages. Our group had people from 10 years old to probably 70.Great tour Gaston!"

Gaston, the guide, has done a terrific job in putting together this tour that will fill you with lots of cultural and historical information in a very dinamic and fun way. IMO, there's no better way to feel a city than walking. He takes the time to answer all questions and he even helps taking some pictures so that you can actually appear on them :). The tour begins at 11am every day except Sundays, it lasts around 2.5 hrs and it's only in English, which he speaks very fluent and neat. Even if English is not your first language (we're mexicans), I strongly suggest you to take it, as you will have no trouble in understanding him. They also offer another free walking tour through the Recoleta area (Aristocratic Tour) on the afternoons, we didn't have a chance to take but I'm sure it's also worth it.At the end of the tour Gaston also helps toursits with recomendations and tips for during your stay in BsAs. He can also help you arrange tickets for Tango Shows or some other tours.Final recommendations:- Arrive with enough time so that you can locate the group, the plaza where the tour begins is medium size.- Wear sunblock and hat, never underestimate the sun of BsAs- Take the tour as early as possible during your visit, so that you can take advantage of the tips and hints during the rest of your stay."

She filled the tour with all kinds of funny stories and insights into Argentine life and culture. We started at the Plaza del Congreso and spent about 2 hours walking around downtown. We saw the Obelisk, the Casa Rosada, Calle Florida, Avenida 9 de Julio and the Plaza de Mayo. We enjoyed ourselves so much, we opted to take the other tour offered by the company later on in the week. We met our tour guide Sol in Plaza San Martin and off we went. This time our group was very small, just 5 of us, so we got a lot of personal attention. This tour was completely different than the first one. This one was called the \"tour of Aristocratic Buenos Aires\" and they were right! We saw more of the ritzy neighborhoods and tons of great the architecture, shopping and people watching. Sol was super sweet and funny, and went out of her way to give us the real story of BA. After our tour was over, she helped my sister and I plan a trip to see a Boca Juniors soccer game.

The guides are really nice people, and very keen about their city and about comunicating all the charme of Buenos Aires to tourists. I have been to Buenos Aires before, but this last time after taking the tour, I gained a better knowledge about the place."

The 5pm tour start time is actually perfect as it gave us the whole day to explore and do other things in the city. Our tour guide Sol made the tour, what could be very dry and boring information, she made come alive with her local knowledge and flair. She is a wealth of knowledge on all things BA, from history, cultural, activities, eateries, shopping, politics... A MUST DO! Most importantly do not forget to tip your tour guide as this is a free tour and they deserve every penny for the great job they do!"

I've traveled all around the world and I try and take the free tours whenever I can. I have never been disappointed. Although this isn't affiliated with any of the European free tours, this one was no different.Honestly, I hate those big tours... its probably the combination of being shown around by some old person and being surrounded by old people in your tour group. With the free tour you feel like your being shown around by your college buddy and these free tours always seem to be attended by young people as well... maybe because it involves a lot of walking and you have to be reasonable fit to complete the tour. I had the evening tour with Sol and the morning tour with Macarena... both were awesome and both are now my facebook friends."

She treated you like a friend who wanted to show off the city where she lived. She even took the time to find us a cab at the end of the tour and later sent us an email on information about other things to see in BA. This tour was one of the best things we did while staying in the city."

The morning tour with Gaston was all around the Microcenter and ended at the Obelisk. We had walked those streets many times before but saw things we had not seen and hearing the history and the stories was amazing. Gaston was entertaining and friendly and really knowledgeable about the historical contexts, politically, economically and socially. He was also helpful in general about things to know in BA. The afternoon tour began at San Martin statue in Retiro and Sol was our guide. She was also amazing in every way! Friendly, funny, smart, personable and filled with tips and info for the rest our trip. The tour took us also to places we thought we would have been to, but had not. Streets we never would have found on our own, even with the map. And the funny and interesting stories she told about all the aristocratic families from the 19th century. And the wars, and the politics as well. I can not recommend these tours enough. The company and the guides survive on tips so tip well, they earn every peso!! I think they should franchise all over the world! Bravo folks...keep up the good work. S&S from Boston"

He took us around to see various landmarks and gave us the history behind each location we stopped at. The information he provided made the tour much more interesting than wandering around town on your own. I read a previous review that complained about waiting for other tourists and the counting of missing people. We also waited and collected late comers. I think that's expected when tourists are making their way to a destination in a city they've never been before. Also, nice that they keep the group together, so no one gets left behind or lost.My friend and I had to leave early. We didn't just take off, we told him we had to leave. He didn't force us to stay. He suggested we go one more block to see one more thing. Really glad we stayed to see something quite unusual.I recommend the tour if you've got time."

The morning tour starting at Congresso was also well attended and even the rain starting half way didn't stop the group from following our guide.

We met with Macka (?) the young girl who was our tour guide for the Aristocrat tour right before the new year. She had us hanging out and waiting until everyone (who wanted to come along) showed up so we started about 10 after 5. Then as soon as we walked over to another attraction, she started counting us. She planned to do this every time we moved. A couple had already left. She went after them and had us WAIT. On a free tour that there is no commitment, she had us wait while she went after other couples. Then in Recoleta, she had the more immature attitude towards the rich and wealthy who lived there, using code words to make fun of them. I found her immature beyond words, and while my husband insisted on tipping her, I would never recommend this tour to anyone."

Planning a recent trip to Argentina, I relied on the advice of fellow traveler comments on Trip Advisor, so it is only fitting I share my experience with you.We wanted to make the most of the limited time we spent in Buenos Aires. BA Free Tours (yes, FREE) was an excellent resource for learning a lot about the city in a short time. We took the morning \"city\" tour, did a little shopping on Florida Street, then joined the afternoon tour, called \"Aristocratic Buenos Aires.\" The morning tour starts at the Congress building and ends at the Obelisk, and covered everything in between. The value comes from seeing the city through the eyes of a porteno. Read the travel books for a black and white understanding; but if you want to add color to your experience, take the tour with a native who puts all of what you read into the context of living in B.A.The afternoon tour starts at Plaza San Martin and finishes at the Recoleta Cemetary. Walking through this section of town you get a strong sense of the history of Buenos Aires. And it is a beautiful part of the city. Gaston and Sol, the tour guides, were excellent. They are very knowledgeable and passionate about the city, and its rich history. As well, ,they are vey amenable to providing you additional information about the city; restaurants, tango shows, etc... Their web address is www. bafreetour.com.Enjoy"

Also, you walk past the Park Hyatt hotel at one point and Sol tells you that for 120 pesos you can go and have afternoon tea there. t's actually 105 pesos for two people as we did it the following week.

First of all, both tours are seriously FREE - no hidden fees... we just tipped both tour guides $30 USD each. But I noticed some who tipped a little less and a little more. It's really up to you what you want to give them. The best is that they don't pressure you about ANY tips at all. I think you finish the tour, and enjoy it and them so much that you want to give them a tip. My husband and I did the City Tour on a Tuesday morning with Marca last week and then we did the Aristocratic Tour on Wednesday afternoon with Sol. We thought both of the tour guides were very passionate about their city giving us great information about the major landmarks while also incorporating aspects of the culture you wouldn't otherwise get unless you knew someone from BA. Both tours were like having your friend take you around their home town. We were especially grateful to Marca for taking my husband and I, along with another tour attendee to a local Pizza place that was so delicious after our tour. We were also especially grateful to Sol who took us on the tour, despite the miserable, cold rain -- and for her to give us a virtual private tour - because nobody else showed up! Plus, she didn't even skimp out on the tour --- she gave us the full tour plus answered all our questions! Both Sol & Marca were such great tour guides!!!! Anyway - obviously I'm giving a high rating because at the end of it all - you see the best of BA plus the culture from very passionate tour guides who clearly just love what they do --- oh and it's FREE (but you really should give a tip)!"

As we can attest, I highly suggest taking the tours early on if not the first day you are in BA just so you can get a sampling flavor of what the city attractions are. My bf and I attended the evening tour on our first full day in BA and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We were lucky enough that the group was small and Sol, our tour guide was able to provide a intimate and more personal tour for us all. I love the concept that they create the tours with the idea that you have a personal local friend in BA. One of the ladies in our tour was craving ice cream and Sol took us to one of her favorite gelato shops on the way of the tour and introduced us to the local flavors. Also upon our arrival, our electrical adapter did not work and Sol helped take us to a local stop and helped us purchase what we needed. She also welcomed us to email her while we are in town if we had any other questions. During the week, I emailed Sol for Malbec and restaurant recommendations and she was prompt in her responses. She was great and I highly recommend anyone to take this walking tour. It is much more personal than an organized paid tour and the guides work on tips within your budget. They are gracious, fun and personable!http://www.buenosairesfreetour.com/en/index.html"

How could you go wrong with a 2 hour free tour giving you unique insights into the history of a great city, led by charming and charismatic guides?We took both the morning and the afternoon tour and they were fantastic and informative. Maca(short for Macarena) led both of our tours and she was funny, smart, and enthusiastic. She was incredibly knowledgeable and had great tips and stories. There is no better way to get an overview of the Microcentro or the Recoleta/Retiro areas. We tipped her each time and it was money incredibly well spent.

They know the city well. And they genuienly want to help you make the most of your trip. We emailed them shortly after the tour for some specific things we wanted to do, and they responded to us right away. The tour is fun and very informative.

Our guide was Sol, who was knowledgeable, friendly and communicated well in English. I also took a 1/2 day city tour run by a major operator in a bus, and enjoyed the Free Tour much more. The sights are best seen on foot, you get more time, you generally meet some interesting people on walking tours, and the guide was much better. The only advantage of the 1/2 day city tours run by larger operators is that you see the \"uptown\" sights as well, though BA Free Tour also operate a second walking tour (which I didn't do) for those sights.I really like the idea these tours are free - but they earn their money from tips. Although having free tours is a great way of introducing their company, Sol told me that they want everyone to be able to take these tours regardless of how much money they have, so they intend to keep them free even as they develop their travel business. BA Free Tour also offer full day tours to the Mataderos Fair most Sundays (not free !). This is one of the less touristic attractions of the city - I signed up for this and was really disappointed when it was cancelled the previous evening as other participants had cancelled.I highly recommend BA Free Tour and hope that Sol and her colleagues are successful in developing their travel business"

The free walking tours of Buenos Aires given by Gaston and Sol are a terrific way to get oriented to the important parts of the city while getting a nice laid-back education about the history and quirks of BA and Argentina. I guarantee you'll have a blast (assuming you like to walk around) and will get lots of ideas about what parts of the city to revisit and spend more time in. Both of the tour guides are great young people who obviously love their city and love showing it to new friends. They'll fill you in on upcoming events to visit, and make themselves available to help you figure out the best restaurants and other places to go to. Thanks guys!"

They have been in business (although the tours are free, they do live off of the tips) a little less than a year. It is suggested to take both tours as Gaston concentrates in the downtown area while Sol covers a small portion of a business section, a wealthy residential area with alot of European architecture and the Recoletta area. This tour does not go into the Recoletta cemetary where Eva Perone is interred. If you are planning to see her crip, there is a charge to get into the cemetary and it closes at either 5 or 6 pm. Sol's tour arrives at this location after the facility is closed so it is necessary to plan the visit either before the tour or for the next day.If you like information/history in a casual atmosphere with some light exercise, don't miss either of the tours."

The evening tour show the rich area of BA (Recoletta and Reitro) and told you about the rich family and there homes. Both yours were different and should be completed. WARNING: The day tour guide warned us about people with green vests at the 5 PM tour saying they are from Free BA tour and asking for money for the tour. This tour is completely FREE tour, they will not ask you for anything except feedback if you want to give it and of course if you enjoy it, which I know you will, you can give them a tip since this is how they make there living. You cannot miss this tour when you visit the city, well worth 2 hours."

We don't normally participate in guided tours or activities, but we had been traveling around the world for 6 months and we were getting a little tired of figuring out stuff for ourselves. We did the evening tour January13th and the afternoon tour January 14th. We arrived in BA on the afternoon of the 13th, so the evening tour that night and the afternoon tour the next day were a good way to familiarize ourselves with the city. Both tours are very informal and more like going on a walk with your local friend as a tour guide . We enjoyed Gaston's afternoon tour most because it's sights allowed us to learn more history about the city. Sol's evening tour is more residential, so their is not as much to learn. Also the way both Sol and Gaston collected the tips was great. At the end, when you gave your tip they just placed the money in their bag with out looking, thus eliminating an awkward transaction. All together the walks were a great thing to do.Danielle & RyanSt. Louis, MO"

Not knowing where to start with the many places to visit and things to do in Buenos Aires, I was happy to find through Trip Advisor this website that advertised free tours of Buenos Aires (http://www.buenosairesfreetour.com). Feeling a little skeptical (\"free\" tours? must have a catch!), I decided to call them anyway to arrange a tour (well, it's not actually \"free\", they work 100% for tips). Little did I know, it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made on the trip. The Aristocratic BA walking tour my wife and I joined was two and a half hours full of fun and very interesting insights from our very friendly guide Sol, who took us around the neighborhoods of Retiro and Recoleta. It was like having one of your good friends (who happens to be a local) take you around town and give you a tour of the city that only a friend can give you (not to mention happily take photos for you!). We had such a good time that we ended up also taking the next morning's Buenos Aires free city tour, which had Sol's equally friendly brother Gaston as our guide. Gaston took us around Plaza de Mayo, Congreso and other places in Centro, and we thoroughly enjoyed his humor and attention to detail during the tour as he toured us around. Between those 2 tours and total of 5 hours with Sol and Gaston, my wife and I felt that we had covered so much of Buenos Aires' most interesting places to visit as well as learned quite a bit about the city's history, culture and people. All in all, I was extremely pleased with both tours. Very highly recommended!"

My 12 year old son and I booked in for the City walking tour, starting at Recoleta cemetery, walking through Retiro along Alvear to Plaza de Mayo. We chose the extension, so our walk was meant to last 4.5 hours and went for closer to 7!Our guide was Don, a very personable North Carolinian who has lived in BA for six years. He was a very nice man, amazingly knowledgable and pleasant to spend time with. We spent more than two hours at the cemetery and we felt we came away with a pretty reasonable basic grasp of Argentinian history, told through the stories of the characters in the tombs. Another highlight was coffee and cake at Cafe Tortoni, said to be the most famous cafe in BA. This is delightful place, old and witness to many of the greats of BA life over the years and an excellent place to rest up for a little while.I can't recommend this company or Don enough. The tours are not cheap, but are well worth the price and for anyone with limited time to spend, or looking to get a good introduction at the start of a longer trip, they are good value.My son highly recommends the tour with anyone his agePack good shoes!"

Jack was simply fabulous, he knows the history of BA and Argentina well and was able to make it relevant to all of us. We fell in love with BA, largely from Jack enthusiasm. I strongly suggest this tour."

We lost all track of time as we toured hidden places while stopping in cafes and wine stores on the way through the historic city centre. Thanks Ceri!"

We thought we would have a short tour of the City and learn some history with Richard but ended up spending about an hour extra because we drank Mate and had a couple of diversions. Great tours."

They arranged transport to pick us up each day for two half day tours of the city, and refunded us some money when not everyone could participate. Richard, our tour guide, has lived on BA for some time and shared lots of interesting history and personal knowledge about the city. We got to tour everything we asked for and more. Do not miss the feria in San Mateo or Cafe Tortoni, a classic tourist cafe. He also knew the lesser known, but really awesome cafes in other areas. Recoleta cemetery was amazing and we actually discovered relatives of in-laws are buried there! Our private walking tour was fantastic and at our own pace. He made sure we saw want we wanted and always checked to make sure we had options. If this is your first trip or a return trip, I recommend this tour."

It was absolutely fantastic and we can't believe how quickly the time flew. We covered the majority of the tour on foot however we managed a taxi ride, bus ride and subway ride. We found this company on the internet and after extensive research decided they best catered for what we wanted to see and do. This has been a highlight for us (2 couple travelling together) and we truly thank Oliver for showing us the sights. We loved eating at a local restaurant for lunch (empanadas and delicious soup) and morning tea at a gorgeous cafe. Oliver was very interesting to chat with and well and truly knew his stuff. I would highly recommend this company. Everything went smoothly and we enjoyed the day immensely - thank you for your company!"

In addition to knowing all the best spots for photos he also made sure we gained an appreciation for the history and the architecture of Buenos Aires. We loved our tour with him so much that we followed up and booked a full day walking/photo tour with him for the following days. He conducts his tour like an old friend showing you the best parts of a city he loves. The next time we are in Buenos Aires we will book him for a tour again along with a midday coffee. If you want a typical \"tourists\" view of BA, he can make that happen. If you want to go \"off the beaten path,\" he can make that happen. If you want to combine your tour with some farm fresh meals from a local co-op and then a pizza from a local shop, he can make it happen. I have honestly never had a better tour in my life and I have taken tours in over 20 countries. My wife and I were very pleased."

Jessica was extremely knowledgeable on all relevant touring topics including history, culture, arts, politics, food, etc. etc. etc. Her time in country along with her educational background and experience lends much credibility to her as a guide, right off the bat. Also importantly, Jessica was adaptable to mine and my traveling partners' varying sightseeing styles. I had a traveling companion who had not taken a private tour before, and this surpassed expectations! The tour of BA infused my short trip with a richness that was unexpected and much appreciated. Cheers to Jessica's office colleagues Justine and Frank as well. They were incredibly responsive to my emails and made my choice to book so easy. The touring staff were kind enough to answer questions before, in between, and after tours. I would say that this is an added bonus as a newcomer and non-Spanish speaker.

We wrote back and asked for some restaurant and activity recommendations, and they responded promptly (and the advice was spot on). Would definitely recommend and use again!

Our first trip was in 2008 and we ran around the city with the Lonely Plant as our guide. For this trip we wanted to get a more in-depth experience and better understanding of the city. Buenos Aires Tours delivered that and more. Since Sunday was the only day we had completely free we opted for La Boca and San Telmo tour. I know Sunday morning can be pretty sleepy around most cities but Jessica met us at our hotel and was ready to go. Jessica currently lives in the San Telmo neighborhood and had a lot of great local insight about the area and what it\u2019s like to live in Buenos Aires. I particularly enjoyed learning about Republica de La Boca and the conversation on current events over a cup of coffee at El Federal. If you are looking for a great walking tour that does more than scratch the surface than this is the group to go with. I have been around the world and taken several walking tour, this one was one of the best."

Bottom line - FABULOUS!!!We read about Buenos Tours on Trip Advisor and we are so happy we booked with them.When you go to Buenos Aires, do yourself a favor and book an amazing tour with Buenos Tours before you go. We booked a private tour. Ask to have a full day escorted tour of the city. Guides are fluent in Spanish and in your language. Our guide was Ceri (pronounced as Kerry) and if the other guides with Buenos Tours are half as great as he is, you are in for a great time. With Ceri we felt like we had made a new friend! We did this \"cab/bus/walk around\" on a cruise day in port (last day before officially getting off the ship), and it gave us a great feel for this beautiful city and we were completely comfortable to go back to many of those places on our own after the cruise. Not only will you see the different neighborhoods, but also you will get to meet fascinating people of Buenos Aires as you tour the neighborhoods: like a wonderful lady who sells wines in San Telmo, the shopkeepers in the local food gallerias, along with various people you will meet along the street. We wanted to go to Boca and that is where our day began. You'll see the Recoleta neighborhood and its tree lined streets and park where you can learn to Tango. You will see the Casa Rosada (and if lucky changing of the guards) and the incredible cathedral across the street - where the guards from Casa Rosada also stand guard, a bookstore that used to be an opera house, and then you can taste the creamy gelato flavors in one of the fabulous ice cream stores. Want another treat? Go to lunch with your guide at the Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, a Buenos Aires fixture for over 100 years (where you can also book reservations for a Tango Show that will not rip you off.) And who knew a cemetery could be so fascinating? Recommendations for dinner? Just ask. No pressure, no hard sell - just honest answers. My husband and I went to a recommended San Telmo parilla for dinner --and experienced a steak you could cut with a spoon, done just right, along with salad and a huge slice of grilled provolone -- all for less than $US40. Ceri knew all of the best places to shop -- without pressuring you to buy anything. They just tell you where the best shops and values are for what you are interested in. My husband bought a beautiful handmade reversible leather jacket (suede on one side, smooth leather on the other) for a fraction of what we would have paid outside Argentina. Whether you are going for a long weekend or for an extended stay, Buenos Tours will give you a great exposure to the neighborhoods, the people and a list of places to see and things to do. Ceri gave us great advice on money. We would have never thought to do this - write your initials on currency to make sure you don't get ripped off in stores, restaurants, cafes, taxis, others who might claim you gave them \"invalid/old currency\". And how to take a taxi. He also gave us great advice on what not to carry (big purse, big backpack) when waking around by ourselves. And not to carry a camera over your neck, an iPad in your hands or anything that someone could easily grab. Thanks to Ceri - we had a fabulous first day in Buenos Aires. And his advice carried us thru..."

Our tour guide, Ceri, was wonderfully funny, personable, and intelligent. The entire time we spent with Ceri he had us thinking deeply about history and current social issues while also laughing hysterically with his sarcastic sense of humor. He was an absolute wealth of knowledge about the city, and particularly knowledgeable about Recoleta Cemetery. Touring the Cemetery with Ceri allowed us to experience so much more than we would have if we visited on our own. Ceri gave us a comprehensive history of the Cemetery and was able to point out unique architectural details that we certainly would have overlooked on our own. Ceri was also very cognizant of our interests while on the tour, and frequently checked in to make sure we weren't feeling overwhelmed by information. Spending the afternoon on tour with him was like exploring the city with an extremely knowledgeable good friend.

He showed me some good places for food and coffee, and ice cream, of course.It was so much fun and a highlight of my trip. Ceri is also a really funny guy, and a pleasure to travel with.During the remainder of my trip I took Ceri's advice, and I had a fantastic time. I went many places along, visited great neighbourhoods, and took reasonable precautions based on his advice. I also had a good idea of where to spend my time, what to eat, and because of that I was able to pack a lot of great experiences into my trip.I highly recommend that anyone who is going to Buenos Aires for the first time to go on a good walking tour with a knowledgeable guide and do not be shy to ask for advice and street proofing.

There are a number of free short walking tours available but we decided that a full day private tour would provide a better understanding of Buenos Aires culture and highlights. We selected Buenos Tours and were not disappointed. Our guide, Richard, did a great job, tailoring the tour to our needs and provided recommendations for the rest of our trip. He had an impressive knowledge of Buenos Aires. We saw other guides during our trip that confirmed we had one of the best guides. Great way to learn the city."

            "review": "Great Introduction to Buenos Aires. We only had 3 full days in BA so, based on the reviews on Trip Advisor, we decided to do the full day tour (including La Boca) with Buenos Tours (in Feb 2016). First, the booking process was seamless and the additional information provided by Buenos Tours extremely helpful (Spanish phrases, meat cuts etc).Our guide on the day was Jessica and she was of great assistance before we even got to Argentina giving us advice on our planned day trip to Uruguay (Colonia del Sacramento). It was possible to contact our guide ahead of the tour because Buenos Tours provides contact details on confirming the booking - a neat feature that we found very helpful, and Jessica responded to these additional questions patiently and with good advice (eg where to change money). Jessica is American and besides showing us the highlights of BA was also able to give us an ex-pats view of life there. She was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable. We mainly walked but also took a taxi and the bus to relocate during the tour (included in the tour price). We were glad that we had booked an exclusive tour just for the two of us - we were able to go at our own pace and linger over the things that interested us (like lunch in Cafe Tortoni).At the end of the day we felt we had really experienced BA and knew the layout of the city well. We thoroughly recommend this tour. [Don't forget to weigh yourself in the old Pharmacy]."

Jack, whose been living here in Buenos Aires for the last 3 years, picked us punctually and took care of us during our 3 hour tour to La Boca and San Telmo - his historical knowledge & keen awareness of current affairs (all mixed with a dose of humor) made this tour a pleasure. We hit all the spots in a carry relaxed manner, stopping for great coffee & empanadas along the way. We thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent with Jack and Buenos tours (booking was efficient and hassle free)! Highly recommended."

She told us about the history, culture, religion, politics, and language of Buenos Aires and was able to answer all of our questions. She was the best tour guide we've ever had.

We stopped at specific places for beverages and snacks that had stories that enriched the tour. We ate the best empanadas in Argentina.

I originally found BuenosTours in a guide book I purchased (I think it was Lonely Planet) for Buenos Aires. Then I saw the reviews on TripAdvisor and couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were. We had never been to Buenos Aires, I have always wanted to go, so I was excited to get a \"lay of the land\" via Buenos Tours and decided to book a walking tour of Recoleta and Retiro for our first full day in the city. This turned out to be an excellent idea and I highly recommend this as an intro. into the city, but regardless of when you do the tour during your trip, it'll be great. We were staying in Recoleta so we decided to start with the walking tour of that neighborhood. I was so impressed by the booking process, thoroughness of the staff via email before we even left the U.S., and amount of info. and thoughtfulness that was put into the booking process that I immediately booked a 2nd walking tour for San Telmo and La Boca for a few days later in our vacation. Both turned out to be wonderful. Our guide was Jessica and she was great, full of information from both a local and an ex-pat's perspective, plus she was very welcoming and ended up being a wealth of knowledge for us during our stay in the city. I cannot express how great it was to be on a walking tour with just my partner and a guide.. no large groups, super one-on-one, easily tailored to your pace, etc. I cannot recommend BuenosTours highly enough and would actually do more tours next time we're in Buenos Aires if we're lucky enough to return to that beautiful city again someday soon! Thanks so much BuenosTours!"

            "review": "Stellar Customer Service & Tours. I've been remiss in writing this review but my delay should not reflect negatively on Buenos Tours whatsoever. I was in BA for business in June, arriving two days early so I could see the city. From the moment I first sent an inquiry to Buenos Tours for a quote for a 1.5 day private tour to after my leisurely weekend passed, Alan was quick to respond to my emails, provided very clear and abundant details, and was very amenable and friendly. As a project manager, I'm very organized and an information hoarder; Alan eased any concerns I had.My assigned tour guide was Richard. He met me at my hotel at the appointed time and waited patiently for me since I was running a tad late from my morning flight arrival. We went over our agenda for the day and set-off. We began at Recoleta Cemetery where Richard impressed me with his immense knowledge of BA/Argentine history & its prominent players. (Recoleta is an amazing place; a must-see!) We then spent the balance of the afternoon strolling through Recoleta & Retiro. While I admired the gorgeous architecture and charming neighborhoods, Richard departed many wonderful stories and historical tidbits. We also stopped at a quaint neighborhood eatery where we enjoyed a lunch of empanadas and a boisterous server who made my day. We also made time for a gelato shop whose interior was all marble and gilt. A great find! Our first day's tour ended conveniently in Plaza San Martin, right in front of my hotel. Our second day began earlier as we had a full day's agenda. We began in La Boca with breakfast at La Perla followed by exploration of the touristy area and warren of shops where Tango was infamously founded. We then ventured into the more residential area of Boca to see the futbol stadium and get a sense of the blue collar area of BA. We also visited a local fire station and visited with the firefighters. Our next destination was San Telmo for their Sunday Market. We spent the better part of the day here shopping, eating, learning more about history & culture, admiring more fabulous architecture, meeting some of Richard's friends, and enjoying Milonga dancing. (This area is where several scenes in the Will Smith movie, \"Focus,\" was filmed.) We made a pit stop at a great Vinoteca whose proprietor gave us a lesson on local Malbec & Cabernet with a generous tasting. (Note: The tasting is not complimentary.) Late afternoon, we walked through the Monserrat neighborhood and to Microcentro to Plaza de Mayo. We explored the area, including Casa Rosada, Metropolitan Cathedral, Cabildo, and a local upcycled craft market. At dusk we chose to walk down Avenida de Mayo to see famous Cafe Tortoni and ended-up on Avenida 9 de Julio in a prime location, right where the Iguazu Falls fountain, another beautiful fountain, and an excellent view of the obelisk and Evita facade are located. There was only one more building I wanted to see - Palacio Barolo - but it was further east on Avenida de Mayo (opposite direction of my hotel) and we were already about 30-45 minutes past my allotted tour time. But, Richard was generous and wanted to ensure I saw everything I desired so we continued our walk despite it being dark. Unfortunately, right before we arrive to Palacio Barolo, we had an incident...a mustard incident to be exact. Luckily, I felt being sprayed and notified Richard immediately and thus did not allow the culprits an attempt to pickpocket us. (Poor Richard got it worse than I did, but it was still in my hair, on my jacket and jeans. Let me tell you, it wreaks horribly and is very difficult to wash out the smell and stain.) Richard offered to take me immediately back and pay for the cab. I declined because we were so close to the Barolo. We soldiered on only to arrive right after the building closed. It was disappointing but it was my fault for not mentioning wanting to visit the building earlier and planning our time accordingly. We then turned back west to find an easier spot to flag-down a taxi. When I finally found a taxi closer to Avenida 9 de Julio, I said not only goodbye to my tour guide, but my new friend. It was a disappointing way to end such a wonderful weekend, being doused in mustard/vinegar, but I refused to let it taint my experience. The next day I received an email from Alan who told me Richard informed him of the mustard incident. Alan offered his apologies and to pay to clean my clothes. I politely declined as it was not Buenos Tours fault (Richard's or otherwise) that we were targeted but I was immensely gratified by the gesture.Bottomline: Buenos Tours was exceptional to work with from the time of inquiry to post-tour. I would whole-heartedly recommend them and certainly hire them again, even just to visit with Richard for the afternoon, exploring neighborhood hidden treasures like a local. They exceeded every expectation, being knowledgeable, friendly, flexible, and customer-oriented."

Alan also arranged our transportation to/from the hotel to meet Jack downtown. Fill out the questionnaire they send you ahead of time so they can tailor the tour to your liking. Not only did we see the tourist spots, but we also immersed ourselves in the culture visiting local cafes and off the beaten track sites. I can't speak highly enough of Alan, Jack and our driver Dario. It was like taking a tour of the city with a member of the family.

We arranged the tour with Frank, who was great about responding to my emails, customizing the tour to include sights and stops to match our interests and then providing additional information about Buenos Aires including restaurant and tango recommendations. Jessica was our tour guide. She is a U.S. expat living long term in Buenos Aires. She has extensive knowledge about the city and Argentina in general and is very good at transferring this knowledge in an engaging manner. Plus, having grown up in U.S., she was able to explain Argentinean history and politics relative to our frame of reference. Jessica met us at our hotel lobby, we reviewed the plans for the day and then we were off to La Boca by taxi. We started early and were able to tour the Carminito street area before it became crowded. A short bus ride brought us to San Telmo for a walk through the neighborhood. We stopped at a local caf\u00e9 for a coffee and then walked on to Plaza de Mayo. Jessica explained the significance of the Plaza in Argentinian history and the principal buildings around it, including a stop outside Casa Rosada. We also visited the Metropolitan Cathedral and it was most impressive. Another short bus ride took us to Recoleta and a walk through this neighborhood. We stopped at a local restaurant that is known for their empanadas and sampled a variety. The tour finished with a visit to the Recoleta Cemetery, which was more impressive than anticipated. Afterwards, Jessica arranged a taxi to take us back to the San Telmo area where we were staying.I'm not able to compare BuenosTours to other agencies as we only used one during our visit, but I do feel very comfortable recommending them. You won't be disappointed with your tour."

I could go on and onabout our day and left much out except to say that Ceri took most ofthe strain of a full day walking tour to use taxi's as needed to movearound on occasion.

We wanted to see the city and experience the culture but knew we couldn't do it on our own. Booking with BuenosTours was easy and lots of information was sent to us in advance to prepare for the private full day walking tour. We arranged to meet our guide, Ceri at our hotel. We wore comfortable shoes, hats, had water & sunscreen and of course, a camera. We had a very special day of seeing not only the history and architecture of the city but it's wonderful people. We had many conversations with people we met on the street or at a shop. We went to little known city gems that reinforced the feeling that we were not on a typical tour. We were with a very special gentleman, who was concerned that we got the best possible experience while visiting his city. Food: For lunch we wanted to try the beef the country is famous for & Ceri's local lunch choice was the perfect choice for us.. We had dessert later. Gelato at another local shop. Truly the best gelato I've ever eaten. To be sure we saw as much as we could, we did opt to take 2 taxis. The cost of the taxis was our responsibility. We knew this and it is explained in writing when we booked & with our guide. However, taxis are inexpensive and we had a guide who knew where we were going. It was a very good option for us on a hot day. We choose BuenosTours based on the reviews of tripadvisor travelers. We feel we made the correct decision to book with BuenosTours and will certainly book again the next time we visit this amazing city."

If you are short of time and if like us you haven\u2019t been to Buenos Aires before then Buenostours \u201cFull day walking tour\u201d, maybe the answer, it is a great way to cover a lot of the city\u2019s attractions and get a feel for the city. Our guide (Jessica) was very friendly, knowledgeable and informative, she walked us through the old city, showing us street art, sculptures, wonderful churches, the Evita balcony and finishing up at the cemetery (a surprising highlight with its eccentric tombs). Jessica gave us a few rest breaks along the way, with time to have a coffee at the local cafes and to discuss local politics, art and life as an expat. We had lunch at Cafe Tortoni, a beautiful art deco caf\u00e9, full of people and a great atmosphere (a must for lunch). I would recommend this tour as a great way to see the city, and if you do go on this tour ask Jessica to introduce you to Mafalda."

I suggest a weekend when possible because the streets are much less crowded (we went on a Saturday)."

Downtown & Recoleta are pretty well covered by some of the excellent free walking tours but for San Telmo and La Boca I booked a half day tour with Buenos Tours, and this proved to be an excellent choice.Ceri met us at our hotel and gave us a most entertaining and informative tour - he certainly knows his adopted city, and had done his homework on our background & interests. We became so immersed in his stories that we all lost track of time and had a bit of a rushed farewell as he left for his next appointment! A great tour of 2 most interesting suburbs, well organised by the tour company and brought to life by a most knowledgeable & entertaining guide."

I had such a fantastic time with Richard, a very interesting, personable, and knowledgable guide with similar interests who I related to perfectly. He is originally from New York but is married to an Argentinian and has such love and enthusiasm for the city, you would think he had been born there. He not only took me to the normal tourist venues but shared some more personal sites that I would not have experienced on a typical tour. We even shared a drink of mate, not my favorite drink, but worth the experience. By the end of the day, I felt like we had known eachother for years.Buenos Tours was also very detailed in their correspondence to me before I arrived in Buenos Aires and responded quickly to every question I posed.This was the best private tour I had during my vacation and I highly recommend both Richard and Buenos Tours for an outstanding experience. My only regret is not booking them for the other days I spent in Buenos Aires, however, I will definitely use them again when I return. Bravo to this company!"

We corresponded with Buenos Tours via e mail and worked up an itinerary. When we met our guide, Richard, we were totally surprised to find he was an American from New York living with his family in Buenos Aires. Needless to say there was no language problem. We explored La Boca, San Telmo and the Jewish area. We found that Richard had many insights, and, to sum it up, we had an amazing day. We spent it exactly as we had hoped for. Walking through the areas, eating local food( we stopped in a delicious empanada place and another local cafe for lunch), riding the local transportation, and experiencing the tour through a local's point of view. If you want to see and experience Buenos Aires, I highly suggest you use Buenos Tours."

I usually take bus tours or private tours with drivers with limited or no time at each site. I was a bit concerned about a walking tour for 8 hours so I divided it up into a PM session on arrival and AM session before our plane. The tour agency was very flexible as our plane was late so we were arrived to the hotel as the guide Richard arrived. He calmed our fears and told us to take our time checking in. Richard is an expatriate from NY who is married to an Argentinian and has lived there for around 15 years so he really understood our culture and homeland and had come to understand the history of Argentina intimately through studies and family relationships. As he toured he made many informational and humorous analogies between our home (NY) and his which made it interesting and fun. We saw every neighborhood in BA from the earliest to modern and came to understand their progressive history. We took buses and cabs and breaks in cute cafe's in between explorations. He made it easy for his two 65+ clients and I would certainly tour this way again. The second day he accommodated our plane departure so we had plenty of time to get to the airport. Thank you BA tours and absolutely recommend Richard. During high seasons he may not be able to be so flexible but if he can he will do anything to make you enjoy the tour."

I would give these tours the highest possible recommendations for an amazing day out on holiday but also to acquire a knowledge and the inside local knowledge of the city and its history.

Traveling for business is a great opportunity to see new places; the downside is how much time you sometimes have to actually SEE a new place--we have learned to make the best of our time with a private tour guide. Typically we do our own research, determine what is of interest to us and style our time that way--other times, we are just on the road non-stop that we DON'T have time to research and just put ourselves into an experts hands letting them know our interests and then listening to their suggestions. Such was the case in BA....we had a WHOLE 6 six hours to spend 'touring' (Sad, I know after being there nearly a week, but we did do some excursions with our business guests) and we met with Ceri. Justine at the office was great in making the arrangements and working with our crazy window of time. We really like being on the streets as much as possible walking or taking public transit--to make the most of our time we did that AND a taxi and we were able to cover a lot of territory---We learned so much and discovered some great places to return and further explore. Seriously consider treating yourself to an expert 'friend' for the day--you really will enjoy it!"

He showed us how to use the subway, ride the bus, explained how the currency exchanged worked, and was very flexible with showing us places and things that we wanted to see. One great example is our desire to try Mate for the first time. He took us to a great little place, ordered for us, showed us how to prepare it, and shared it with us.

Tour - Intro to Buenos Aires and Recoleta Cemetery TourWe had been on a tour 15 years ago and wanted to repeat the experience since the first tour in 2000 was with a cruise line and the tour group was about 60 people. It was a great tour but not very personal. My goal this time was that I wanted to be able to ask more questions, gain more insight and feel free to have a discussion about the aspects that interested us without fear of being rude to other tourists (as you would, if it was a large group). We communicated in August with Buenos Tours (BT) and submitted our request, talked about our interests, some of our history and even some limitations that we have while touring. Through those email conversations they paired us with a guide who had similar interests / background and we locked into the tour. The guide was Ceri and we found him to be intelligent, insightful, patient and very professional. He did a very good job of assessing us in the beginning of the tour to get a better understanding of who we were and what our expectations were. But he did this all in a way that was friendly and very conversational (the mark of a real pro). He listened as much as he spoke and was able to \u201ccut to the chase\u201d as to what we needed and what we wanted to do. Our first stop was an exchange location where we were able to understand and become comfortable with exchanging our US currency to Argentine peso\u2019s. The famous blue dollar. He provided us a lesson in how / where to get a cab....the correct side and the wrong side for getting in and expectations on tipping. We stopped at a beautiful caf\u00e9 for a quick coffee and bathroom break before we entered the cemetery. Recoleta can be appreciated on many levels. It\u2019s an amazing cemetery, it\u2019s a slice of history that will never be repeated, the architecture is very unique, the sculpture is amazing, the mosaic tiles are beautiful. Ceri was a great guide with insights from all of those perspectives. He has a great sense of humor which both Linda and I appreciated as we toured. He confided to us that he had done a quick refresher tour for himself a few days prior so he would be able to guide us to the multiple highlights. My wife and I are both architects and have a strong interest in cemeteries from this period in time. As we entered the cemetery, the first stop was to the guard desk where Ceri spent some time joking with them and introducing us. One of the gaurds was having a mate tea break where the tea is consumed from a decorative wood cup with a silver straw. It was shared by the group. Clearly, an experience that we would not have had on our own. Recoleta is so large and when you start to spend several minutes at each mausoleum ... our morning was quickly being used. I could tell that Ceri was \u201crecalculating\u201d what he wanted to show us so that we could see \u201cthe best of\u201d before his time with us was concluded. Not an easy task when your audience is so keen to see it all. We were surprised when one of the Recoleta care-takers approached us as we were admiring a tomb and we had a conversation. Ceri has a way of speaking that shows a great deal of respect and before we knew it, the caretaker offered to show us some of his favorites and even joked about his large key ring, making him look like he was an earthly Saint Peter with the keys to heaven. Before we knew it, our time with Ceri had exceeded our tour, which Ceri was very generous with. He could see that we were still entrenched in our exploration so he recommended that we stay and continue to tour and directed us to the other areas that we had not seen yet. Ceri and BT exceeded our expectations. The informative emails in August to put the tour together were exchanged in a prompt time frame. The emails a week prior to the tour to coordinate the initial meeting were detailed and exact. The follow up after the tour has been a lot of fun too. A great guide, great tour and great tour company."

Before going into how special this tour was, I should state that my husband and I usually never take tours anywhere because we worry that most offer only cookie-cutter, superficial experiences to tourists. Having looked at the reviews for this company and the kinds of tours they do, however, we decided to try it out to see if this was the type of tour that offered a more intimate experience of the city.On short notice, I emailed Buenos Tours and had a very nice and friendly exchange with Alan, the company's founder, who quickly facilitated our interest in taking a half day tour (4 hours) customized to our interests. We were lucky enough to get a tour booked only 3 days from when we arrived (although I would advise that if you are interested in taking a tour, book well in advance and maybe even schedule something a day or two after arriving).On the day of the tour we met our guide, Ceri, at our hotel and discussed what we might like to see. We were interested in seeing most things and were open to wherever he thought we might like to go, which was the right decision. Not only did Ceri take us to some intriguing places (a wine shop in an art deco building, a used bookstore, a tango club, a cathedral, a cultural center, an anarchist craft fair, the Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, and many others), but he engaged us in the kind of conversation that was an experience unto itself. In other words, there was a spirit of camaraderie and affinity that developed around us, a buena onda (good vibe) as they say in Argentine Spanish. Ceri is very funny, which lends itself to this spirit easily taking shape. But he's not just funny, he knows what a genuine engagement with people looks and feels like and tries to offer that on the tour. This was proven, for instance, when he took us to a club where older people dance the tango. There, I was moved to tears by the unmediated expression we witnessed (something that seems rarely to occur in the US). No matter how old or fashionable the people were in this club, everyone looked absolutely gorgeous. We looked upon them with admiration and appreciation. I don't want to spend any more time writing here as I'd like to sit back and savor the experience, but needless to say it is well worth your time and money. Do this. You will enjoy it. Perhaps you will even laugh and cry, too!"

This was absolutely the best possible way to see the city. Our guide Jessica was enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and made the day a special event. She met us at our hotel and then we were off via taxi, subte (metro) and walking. Cafe and restaurant stops were based on our desires, but do not miss these opportunities. The tour format is flexible and can accommodate any circumstance or interest. Perfect Day!"

Firstly, we did the day trip to Colonia with Oliver, only the three of us so my wife and I had his undivided attention, we booked quite late but they still took our booking. Oliver was a very informative, entertaining character, his approach was unique and well enjoyed by us. He showed a high level of passion for his job and made the tour interesting despite the town being very simple and quaint. Fully recommend to do Colonia with Oliver.Secondly, we did a VIP tango dinner/ show through the same company. We had a private booth, private transfer and drinks with dinner which were all wonderful and worth the extra if you can afford it. The musicians made the show however as they played non stop between the dancers and really worked hard!The only criticism is that you are still expected to tip/ pay for the service at the tango show, which should just be all inclusive."

Being in the travel industry, I have many dealings with tour companies and I felt the response and time given to me by Buenos Tours was one of the best!! We did the VIP Tango show at Piazzolla Tango. Our seats were amazing (we had a private booth elevated so we could see everything) and the food/wine was delicious!! We were completely captivated by the show...the dancers and the music. It was beautiful. There was a slight mix-up with the transportation to/from the venue (which was included in our VIP package) but I contacted Buenos Tours immediately and they were very receptive and helpful in making sure all was taken care of. I was impressed by their response time and willingness to help (no matter the fact it was in the evening and after business hours). I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this company to anyone wanting excellent service and experiences in Buenos Aires."

We arrived in BA after a long flight from London feeling lousy - but we had to stay awake because I'd arranged a walking tour of the Retiro and Recoleta with BuenosTours. Travelling with two teenage boys I was concerned that everything could go wrong. In fact, I needn't have worried at all! Our guide, Ceri, arrived at the hotel bang on time and was friendly and engaging right from the start - even managing to get my boys interested in the Recoleta cemetery and the other sights in the vicinity (although best for them was a trip to an ice cream parlour). Not only was Ceri a great guide with loads of knowledge about BA and an opinion on everything he took us to see, but he also had loads of practical tips which helped us on the rest of our trip to BA and Argentina. Of course it helped a lot that he was a native English speaker.This tour was such a great introduction to Argentina that it really gave our trip a boost, right from the start - it was bit like taking a tour with an old friend. I really cannot recommend this company highly enough."

My mother and I were visiting Buenos Aires for three days, and didn't really know what to do, and so we decided to take a tour based on all the rave reviews posted on tripadvisor. Buenos Aires is such a big, modern, bustling city, but I think it would be hard to see all the secret little gems that make it so enchanting to visit without a tour guide. Ceri was awesome, he took us all over the city, walking and in taxis, but we never felt rushed or tired. We had coffee, empanadas, we saw tango, and everywhere we went felt local and special. I especially appreciated the tour the next day, when my mother and I got lost and frustrated every two blocks because I am a terrible planner. It was nice to have a day planned out for us, especially when we got to look at art and architecture, eat delicious food, and have such a gracious host. We loved our tour, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."

All three were excellent. The staff at Buenos tours communicate very well with you via e-mail. They answer your questions and keep you up to date with the details of your tour.Our walking tour guide, Jessica, was outstanding. She showed us things we would have otherwise missed, all while giving us a fascinating look into Buenos Aires. I would highly recommend a tour with Jessica. It goes at your pace, and you learn so much.Our day trip to the Camino Pampa estancia was the highlight of our trip to BA. This tour is priced higher than other estancia trips offered by other companies, but it is worth every penny. We were picked up by a driver (Mr. Cesar) who gave us a very nice history of Argentina on our drive to the ranch. When we arrived at San Antonia de Areco, we were met by an absolutely amazing guide--Juan Manuel. We can't say enough good things about Manuel--he was wonderful. Knowledgeable, friendly, and he clearly loves what he does. That translated into an exceptional day for us. We learned so much, and really enjoyed our day on the ranch--horseback riding, having a traditional \"asado\" lunch, and listening to traditional gaucho music. It was all topped off with a display of horse taming that was incredible to watch. This tour is worth the price of admission.Finally, we used Buenos Tours to see the Piazolla Tango show. Tango shows are clearly aimed at tourists, but again, this one was a notch above the rest. The food was average, but you're not going for the food--there's plenty of excellent food available all over Buenos Aires. Where the Piazolla Tango show stands out is the talent. The dancing was outstanding as was the live band--really a treat to watch. The added bonus was the group tango lesson before dinner. It was fun to try to tango, but it just makes you appreciate the talent level of these dancers."

Highly recommend these guys for the private walking tour, we did the Recoleta & Retiro tour but if we had more time would have loved to have seen more with them!"

He seemed to very quickly understand which aspects of Buenos Aires we were interested in and worked hard to ensure that my father, in his 80s, did not get too tired. The cold beers were an added bonus!I would encourage anyone visiting BA to give this tour a go."

            "review": "Perfect way to spend a day in Buenos Aires. I cannot say enough good things about this experience, so I guess I will start at the beginning.I got two days notice that I would be going to Buenos Aires for work and would have one day (Sunday) to myself upon my arrival. So I quickly went to google looking for a bus tour or traditional walking tour. Instead, I found BuenosTours.I filled out the online form and within minutes, Justine responded to me with a recommendation for a 7 hour walking tour (Buenos Aires 101) with details on the stops while also making sure to let me know that there would be opportunities to tailor my tour to fit my needs because it is a private tour so it would be just be me and the guide (if you are traveling with a group, obviously it will be your group and the guide). We went back and forth with a few questions - all of her responses being timely and extremely helpful, and I went ahead and booked the tour.After doing so, I filled out a form with more information about myself and was sent a picture of my guide, Jessica. In the form, I mentioned that Monday and Tuesday I would likely not venture far from the hotel so would be interested in recommendations from Jessica about the immediate area. I didn't even have to wait until I was on the plane before Justine had emailed me with a list of fun to do things, places to see, and restaurants to visit, all within a few blocks of my hotel. Honestly, having not traveled internationally in many years, and being a woman by myself, I was a little nervous about this trip. Just the act of booking the tour and seeing how they do business, eased a lot of my nerves.Sunday came, and Jessica met me in the lobby of my hotel promptly at 10am. We began to walk and she helped me get a bit of a general orientation of the city based on the location of my hotel. After that, we jumped into a cab to head to San Telmo, the start of the tour. If you can come on a Sunday, definitely visit the market in San Telmo. Jessica and I wandered the market, hopped into interesting architectural areas, and walked down side streets that had interesting stories and things to offer. Jessica was overwhelming knowledgable but also extraordinarily relatable. It can be nerve racking spending 7 hours one on one with a stranger - but almost immediately I felt like a friend was showing me the city as locals would see it.At the market, we came upon an antique stand with horse tack. Owning a horse of my own, I was extremely interested in this. My Spanish is minimal, at best, but Jessica helped me have a rich and informative conversation with the vendor and I was able to learn tons about the gaucho culture and the ranches in Argentina. This was a highlight for me as it included something I am passionate about at home as well. She also helped me navigate buying a souvenir for myself in the market, exchange rates, etc.We traversed the market, went inside to a food market that is there all week, and made our way into the center of the city. All the time Jessica provided me with information about the amazing immigrant history of the city, interesting facts about the origin of tango music and dancing, and information about what it is like for people currently living in this amazing neighborhood.The next highlight was Plaza de Mayo, where there was a Basque festival going on. We were actually able to go into the Pink House, and Jessica was able to tell me information about the current government as well as the history of the military state in Argentina, the Perons, and protests that often occur in the square.We then had a perfectly timed coffee stop and I followed Jessica's recommendation of getting Chocolate y Churros. Delicious! During our coffee break, Jessica was able to fill me in on the cafe culture within Buenos Aires, some of the artistic history, and current Argentine's views on their place within the world. After a nice break, we continued our walk, hopped a bus (a great experience most tourists don't get) and headed into some of the upscale, northern parts of the city. Wow are these houses gorgeous. We stopped for lunch and once again I followed Jessica's recommendation of getting empanadas that I washed down with a delicious house Malbec (I am in Argentina after all). At this point, we ran into another one on one tour from BuenosTours which seemed to be having just as much fun as us, so we decided to join together to finish the tour at the Recolata Cemetery.This place gorgeous! Both guides had amazing stories to tell about the different people buried there, pointed out details on some of the structures I would never notice, and provided a laugh (or many) along the way as well. They were right, that this Cemetary doesn't feel like a place of death but more like a celebration of life.We ended our tour with an ice cream and a good bye near my hotel. I was sad to say goodbye to Jessica as I had such a relaxed and fun time with her and felt that I probably only had the time to crack the tip of her knowledge about this amazing city.Overall, this was an unbelievable experience from my initial inquiry with Justine until the end of the tour. Jessica was so knowledgeable and able to relate that knowledge in an accessible way, tailored the tour to my interests, and really made me feel like a part of this city, all while creating an informal enough environment that it felt just like chilling with a friend. Justine (who I believe is a lot of the organization around the business) was also extremely helpful, responsive, knowledgeable, and eager to make sure my experience was amazing. All of this with only two days notice!My one regret is that I will not get to spend more time in this amazing city. I would say to anyone, skip the group tours, skip the bus tours, and take the time to do BuenosTours - it was an excellent day! I can't say thank you enough to Jessica and Justine!"

After reviewing their informative and thorough website, we chose the all-day tour as we wanted to see the city \"up close\" not from a bus window. The tour and our guide Don were amazing - a highlight of our trip. He met us at our hotel .. it was like having a personal friend show you around his city. We loved La Boca, the history of Buenos Aires we learned, the chance to stop and photograph whenever we wanted, and the chance to ask every question we could think of. It was a close up look at a city with one who lived there and could share so much of his expertise.I needn't have worried about walking all day, as we didn't! During the day we took taxis, bus, & subway at opportune moments and there were refreshment, lunch stops as well. We also had input throughout the day on what WE would like to do/see next. This was the first full day of our trip to South America where we cruised around Cape Horn, and we both voted the Buenos Aires tour as the best part of the entire 2 weeks."

His knowledge of his city went way beyond what you read in guidebooks; he was able to impart the feel of each neighborhood we visited and what gives each area its distinctive identity. A gifted storyteller, Ceri made each place we visited memorable by providing insight into the history and people who made it what it is today. His love of Buenos Aires was contagious. Though this tour came at the beginning of a three week trip that took us up the coast via Uruguay and southern Brazil to Rio, it is still the highlight of the whole trip, thanks to Ceri. Buenos Tours isn't the cheapest way to see Buenos Aires, but it sure is the best. Worth every peso!"

We visetend Buenos Aires during our cruise of South America which lasted 10 weeks and our visit to BA was one of the highlights of our visit. All communication with the company before our visit went really well but there does seem to be a bit of a turnover in staff so there were a couple of changes to our name guide before we went. We also felt we were bombarded with too much information. Maybe that's a British thing? However that should not detract from the fact our guide, Jack, was excellent - warm, friendly and knowledgeable. He was unstinting of his time, and tweaked the tour exactly to fit in with our requests. We loved the included rip on the subway and also the fact he was so helpful in helping us find a place to change our currency. He also answered all our questions quite happily and gave us fantastic advice with our plans for the rest of the day after we left him and for our second day in BA. Great guy, great tour."

My husband enjoys discussing politics and history and both Jack and Jessica provided lively discussions. Smart people who know their stuff! The tour company provided detailed instructions on pickup times and provided a driver for our first day tour to meet Jack. The price was very reasonable for a private tour, which to me is the way to go in a big city. I can't say enough good things about this group. Just book and you will not regret it!"

Justine patiently crafted two day tours for us and tweeked timings and content to fit exactly what we wanted to do. Jessica, our guide was excellent, really easy to get along with, and so passionate about Buenos Aires, but also honest and frank with any questions we had. We loved all the little food stops along the way, she very quickly grasped that we wanted to eat as the locals would and took us to some great little spots that we probably would not have gone to on our own. We covered so much ground in two days and we felt like we spent the days with a friend showing us around their city rather than just a tour guide! We also booked tickets for the Piazolli Tango Show through Buenos Tours and it was a high quality show with excellent food. Highly recommended!"

The day of the tour, there were downpours all day and we were offered the opportunity to reschedule or proceed-completely our choice. We went for it and our guide was a real trooper- we had a full day's adventure that will stay with us forever. Ceri (by birth Canadian-English) was an amazing raconteur and shared so many insights into life in Buenos Aires that we could never have gotten. He led us around the city much more efficiently than we could have on our own (taxi, bus, and foot) and took us to some small markets, shops, cafes and no tourist traps that we would never have found on our own. We are very independent travellers- plan everything ourselves and one of us is fluent in Spanish so we would have been fine seeing Buenos Aires on our own- BUT we would never have had such a rich experience. This will stay with us forever. I would (and do) recommend this tour to anyone who has the chance. They tailor the tour to your specific interests. If you are spending several days in Buenos Aires, I highly recommend arranging a half- or full day tour for your first day with BurnosTours- it is not to be missed and it serves as a great orientation for the rest of your stay."

My wife and I are seasoned global travelers who only want to take private tours with our own guides and drivers. Boy, did we find the right agency! This was our very first visit to South America. We were spending three nights in Buenos Aires before going on an Oceania cruise. Ever since my first contact with Alan, he was thorough and tireless in giving me advice and direction in designing a tour just for us and on things like money exchange, transportation, safety,...He was a remarkably responsive e-mailer even under heavy workload. I felt like our tour started days before we set foot in the city. Alan arranged an excellent VIP Tango dinner-show for us on the first night. On the second day, we had an in-depth tour of the city with Ceri, a multi-talented Canadian expat who was very much into the history and architecture of the city. Even our warm and enthusiastic driver, Gilbert, could easily serve as a guide himself. The following day we had an exciting cruise on River Tigre in a private boat with Oliver who is a conscientious and delightful American expat. What sets BuenosTours apart from many other tour agencies is that their staff are flexible and proficient in communicating with foreign visitors. At the end of my tours with them, I fancied taking a couple of BuenosTours guides with me to the other ports of call!"

They arranged to have a driver (Chris) pick us up at the airport (me, wife, son and son's friend) and take us to our hotel in Palermo for a quick change, and then to meet Ceri, our tour guide for the day. Ceri was incredible. Friendly, knowledgeable, funny, a native English speaker: the whole package. We began by touring the Recoleta Cemetary, where Ceri used the identity of the famous dead as a backdrop for a lesson in Argentine history. After a lunch of enpanadas and beer, we continued our tour through the area, to Alvear avenue by the perfume shop Fuegia and the Park Hyatt and Vatican Embassy. We passed the Brazilian and French Embassy before crossing the 9th of July Avenue. In Retiro we walked through the Plaza San Martin, saw the Anchorena building, Kavanaugh building and the Paz palace, before taking the subway from San Martin to Av de Mayo. We had coffee at the Cafe Tortoni, visited the national cathedral, talked about the Mavinas/Falklands, saw the Pink Palace and walked down Defensa to the Franciscan church, walked by the Puerto Rico church, the Avila bookstore and the Jesuit church by the Roca statue. We then walked up the Av de mayo, crossing the 9th of July. We saw the Palacio Barolo and the Hotel Chile (art nouveau) and then to Rodin's the Thinker in the plaza de Congreso until we stopped by the congreso and the confiteria molino. By this time, it was time to return to the hotel and get ready for a tango show, all of us feeling like we had learned a ton about this new and fascinating city. I can't imagine a better introduction."

We explained via e-mail that we only had one afternoon in BA and said we were specifically interested in Recoleta Cemetery and having lunch at Caf\u00e9 Tortoni. Based on the great response, we booked our private, half-day tour. During the booking process, we also mentioned we were specifically interested in Recoleta Cemetery and having lunch at Caf\u00e9 Tortoni, as well as our need to be back at our hotel by 5pm that day.Our guide met us at our hotel on-time and was a very nice guy. However, when he went over what we would be doing on our tour, we were surprised that we were not going to Recoleta until the end of the tour, but assumed he knew best.Throughout the tour, we did mention a couple of times how Recoleta Cemetery was a focal point of our visit... but as time went on, we finally had to come right out and ask him if we could go to the Cemetery without doing the rest of his tour first. He seemed almost upset about that, saying we'd have time to do all the tour and Recoleta and be done by 5pm. We reiterated that we needed to be AT the hotel by 5pm (and not done the tour by 5pm) and insisted we go straight to the Cemetery at that point, which we did.However, by the time we got to the Cemetery, we did NOT have enough time there (about a half hour). We definitely wished we had more time there, and were disappointed that we did not... and then had to rush to our hotel by taxi to be there by 5pm.Don't get us wrong, we enjoyed our tour and got to see a lot of BA and were given a lot of information, but... we booked a PRIVATE tour with specific requirements and in the end felt that it was our guide's tour and not \"our\" tour, customized to us.Our recommendation would to be to use BuenosTours, but if you have specific requirements, make sure they will be met. In hindsight, we should have insisted we start at the Cemetery so that we could have spent all the time we wanted to there, and then done as much of the other part of the tour that time permitted (not the other way around)."

We didn't think that anybody could be better than Don, but Quincy was just as great. She really gave us a good feel for the city, and when we came back from our cruise, we were able to retrace some of the paths she had showed us to spend more time in some of the places she showed us.We are very glad we split it into two half day tours - it gave us some time on our own to wander around after the tours. Both Quincy and Don obviously love the city, and we started to really like it, as well. They gave us advice on restaurants and other places to see. I can't think of a better way to get an introduction to the city. There was a group tour staying at the same hotel, and their bus passed us 2-3 times while we were walking.

She was great and very helpful in trying to help us get our coats that we left on the plane. She was very informative and gave us lots of insight to Buenos Aires. We highly recommend her and the company. The company is very easy to work with. They give lots of information for pre planning. I was very impressed with the way they run their business. They deliver on what they promise."

We like walking and had limited time, so we decided on a full-day walking tour, including La Boca, San Telmo, the Center and Recoleta. Our guide, Richard, was WONDERFUL! He's a transplanted New Yorker who has lived in BA for the last ten years. He loves showing people around and is just a terrific person. He's also a film maker and took us for a brief detour to his studio in San Telmo. We set out to see a number of the basic sights, but as the day went on and we shared our specific interests, he modified the tour accordingly and took us to places off the set tour route. He also had great recommendations for things we could do the next day on our own (we would highly recommend both the Evita Museum and the MALBA), as well as giving us some good restaurant recommendations. BuenosTours would be at the top of my list for good walking day tours; my Fitbit said we covered almost 8 miles and it was a joy (a couple of taxi rides and a bus ride also moved us from area to area). In fact, we're now planning a trip to Patagonia next Jan and we plan to stop in BA again, where we'll definitely have Richard give us the post-graduate day tour in Buenos Aires! Mike and Roz P"

We reserved the San Telmo/La Boca 1/2-day tour with Buenos Tours, and had such a great experience with the booking process (responsiveness, courtesy, restaurant recommendations, etc.) that we decided to also book the Recoleta/Retiro tour for another day. We had Jessica as a guide for both tours, and she provided excellent insight on all of the areas we visited and even allowed us to stray off the normal tour schedule in La Boca for a visit to the Qunquela Martin Museum. The tours were not rushed or superficial, so it was nice to get all of the information in a more relaxed and unscripted fashion. It was also cool to have an ex-pat's perspective on Buenos Aires and compare Argentinian events and culture to the USA. I highly recommend this company, and Jessica as a guide. Their rates are incredibly reasonable, and you won't be disappointed."

These communities are best suited to touring as a very small group. Richard's extensive knowledge from having lived in both areas over a number of years enabled us to visit a number of unique out-of-the-way spots that we never would have come across on our own, nor been able to visit as part of a large group. Along the way we also met several skilled artisans in their little workshops, which was great, but never felt that we were getting steered or influenced in any way to buy. We were however very impressed with the unique quality of the work and plan to return to some to make purchases. This is a great tour to do on a week-day if possible, to get oriented prior to returning on Sunday for the big San Telmo market. Richard is a very knowledgeable, interesting, and personable guy; and we chatted about everything from politics to film-making to art in the tour context. If we only had more time we would have loved to do another tour with him, such as the photographer tour.If you found this review useful kindly click on Helpful YES."

To put this in context, we spent 2 weeks in Santiago / BA / MonteVideo / Rio doing this sort of thing with our two kids (15 and 17).It's crazy, really, the extent to which these guys went to make everything go smoothly. I'm not sure I've ever seen such a professional response, and certainly not in South America (sorry SA, but your customer service ability is 20 years or so behind Europe and North America. Too many companies, too many minor problems for it to be a coincidence. But these guys are an exception!)First of all, they sent a confirmation email with pictures of the driver and guide attached (ie. so we would recognize them), with every possible logistical question answered and a bunch of links to more information. We got picked up at our B&B (this in itself was impressive, as literally every taxi we took in BA had trouble finding it, despite our showing them a map and it being on an apparently normal street, a few blocks from the downtown airport) and driven to La Boca where Ceri was waiting for us.He took us on approx. 45 minutes in La Boca, then a public bus to San Telmo for another hour or so, ending up in a wine shop just off Plaza de Mayo, where he had a chilled bottle waiting for us. We hung out there with him for 20 minutes drinking it.Those are flawless logistical details. It goes without saying that Ceri's knowledge of BA, both currently and historically, seemed to be encyclopedic. What was even more impressive was his obvious love of BA specifically and travelling in general (he's from Canada and spoke flawless English and Spanish and seemed to be on a first name basis with half the people in La Boca).He's the kind of guy I occassionally meet travelling who makes me wish I could/had spend/t a lot more time actually living in different countries, instead of just visiting them. Lastly, he was great with our kids, and went out of his way to make them feel comfortable and engaged.It's really hard to think of anything Ceri or this company could have done better."

He showed us things like street art, hidden churches, and local lunch spots, which we would never have been able to find on our own, and which made our day special. He also took us to several historical sites like the Pink House and the cemetery where Eva Peron (and several other notable BA figures) are buried.

Before I booked, I had several requests, including to pick my guide (I thought I'd get along better with a woman, so I chose Jessica), to start the tour a bit later, etc. Buenos Tours was very quick to respond and more than accommodating with what I suspect were pretty unusual demands. (No doubt most people just take what they get, but as this was my first trip to BA and as I only had one day, I wanted to get the most out of it). After I booked, I received several emails from them asking what my interests were so that they could tailor the tour to me, in addition to several tips for what else to do in BA. I ended up booking a tango evening through them as well.I was really looking forward to my tour as well as the tango dinner, until fate intervened and I came down with a terrible case of strep throat. I had to cancel at the last moment - and I do mean the very last moment. In fact, due to some email difficulties, they did not receive my cancellation until the evening before my tour (and after the bus had come to pick me up for my tango dinner). I felt awful for cancelling so late, but my poor health left me with no other choice. I could not talk or swallow and my fever was such that I was starting to hallucinate.Long story short, the folks at Buenos Tours were more than understanding. They issued me a full refund on the tour, were able to negotiate a 50% refund on the tango dinner (even though the theatre had a strict no cancellation policy), and they were very kind in wishing me a quick recovery.I have never before left feedback for a tour I did not even go on, but the customer service of Buenos Tours was so superb - and so rare - that I felt obliged to do so.I am sure the tour would have been fantastic, and I will definitely be in touch with them the next time I am in Buenos Aires.

I can only guess that she knows more about Buenos Aires history and culture than most native-born folks. She had majored in Latin American studies and, as I recall, Spanish as well. And, she was very friendly as well. She took an interest in what we wanted to know and, since we are Jewish, she made it a point to weave her knowledge of Jews in Buenos Aires into the tour.Jessica picked us up at our hotel and we took a taxi to the start of 7ish hour tour. I'm terrible at remembering names of places but we saw A LOT in those seven hours. The day was packed but not rushed. And, we stopped for \"lunch\" which we turned into an appetizer break, and later had ice cream.We booked the tour just a day in advance, we paid online, and the office handled our logistics perfectly.I give a 5 star review to Jessica and to Buenos tours but I'd give more stars if I could."

An ex-pat living for a long time in B.A. Jessica is able to share her true love for the city, mixed with the realism of an outsider loving and forgiving look.I particularly enjoyed our conversations on the daily life, economy, and hopes of portelenos, a great day, even if it rained cats and dogs. Imagine this summer..."

Finding myself alone in Buenos Aires for a day and hardly knowing the city at all led me to book this private tour and it was the best decision. From the moment of my 1st email enquiry the process was so well organised and the response to my enquiry was incredibly prompt. I met my guide, Richard, at the designated place and from there we walked and chatted and it was hanging out with a friend. He is extremely knowledgable with all the facts and and obviously very passionate about this city. I loved that he didn't seem to adhere to a strict schedule or itinerary. The cemetery is fascinating and it is particularly worthwhile walking through with Richard as he points out various graves, explaining who was who, the historical importance and any curious little intrigues. Walking round Retiro was also fascinating, learning of the past grandeur of all the mansions, the families who occupied them and the lifestyles they must have led. At the end of the 3 hours I felt I had a wonderful insight into the life and history of Buenos Aires."

His local knowledge and very informative 'presentation' was brilliant. We did the full day walk (about 7.5 hours) and it was worth every cent. From being met promptly in our hotel foyer, to having a tailor made walk centred around the information you provide at booking, the day is filled with hidden gems of little known facts and insider information that is priceless. Not rushed in any way, we were able to stroll through various parts of old and new BA, stopping to admire the architecture and statues around the city. We stopped for lunch at a great little restaurant in Recoleta where we had the tastiest selection of Empanadas we've had while here.If there is one thing you do while visiting this history filled city, this would have to be it!! Thanks Ceri, was an exceptional experience."

Our guide Richard was wonderful for the first day - made sure to tailor the tour to things that interested us, was very knowledgable and really went above and beyond for us (checked on us the next day and sent us follow up suggestions for the rest of our stay). Oliver was also great on our additional day, and he had communicated with Richard to know about us ahead of time. The highlight was the cemetary tour with Oliver as he included some really interesting (and spooky!) stories that aren't often told and is an excellent story teller. He is an actor as well so this really added to the experience when hearing about the history, etc. Overall, we really felt taken care of and that we got the most out of our short visit.The bookings team is also great - they were super fast via email with responses and sent a photo of each guide so we knew who to look out for (clever!). They are pricier than other companies out there but well worth it to us.Highly recommend!"

We loved the \"caf\u00e9\" she took us to for lunch/snack just outside the Recoleta cemetery. (I will review this separately). She had wonderful stories to tell about various masoleums in the cemetery. Without her we would not have found Evita's resting place. Many other interesting \"characters\" and facts!Afterwards, she found us a taxi and even offered to go back to the hotel with us because the wheelchair did not fit completely into the trunk.

This time we thought seeing a city through a window was like watching a video, so we choose to do a walking tour instead. We found Buenos Aires Walking tours on Trip Advisor and made our plans.Our guide Ceri (pronounced Carey) met us at our hotel and we took a taxi to La Boca, the home of the tango. It was Sunday and there was soccer match at the stadium and there were craft fairs in the streets. The air was electric with the sights, sounds, and aromas from the restaurants that had set up tables in the streets in front of their dining rooms. He escorted us around and filled us in with the history of the area and encouraged us to become part of the party.We took a bus to another area where the streets were full of street performers and live music and there were art shows and antique shops and restaurants. We felt that for the first time we were part of the fun of Buenos Aires and not just observers from an air conditioned bus.Ceri was an excellent guide who is well worth spending time with. He was born in Canada and raised in England (so the there is not language problem) and now becoming a citizen of Argentina. He and his wife are in the Theater and their story is a great one. We shared a lot in common.After the tour we took a taxi back to the hotel.

We met Chance at Sheraton Hotel, which was close to the port, and started our day. We had said we were interested in looking at things away from main tourist areas, and Chance showed us some great neighbourhoods, with really beautiful old buildings. We went into one of oldest cafes, and original shopping arcade and the food market. Chance had an amazing knowledge of the city and the buildings. We had lunch at very popular restaurant(Caf\u00e9 Tortoni), had to queue outside, and then waiters were bustling around . Also Chance took us into a very beautiful bookshop that had once been a theatre and all the original structures were still there. Had basically just removed the seats, all the private boxes remained, and the stage was now a caf\u00e9 , but all the lighting switches and stage props remained. Was great to see that all that hadn't been lost, when the use of the building changed. We then we out to Recoleta cemetery, and saw all the enormous tombs and Chance explained all the different methods of storing the dead. Then it was time for a gelato and a sit down inside the gelato shop, which was great after all the walking, and it had been a hot day. Chance had however tried to find shady areas to stop when we were looking at the sights.We felt very safe walking around the city, and really had an amazing day.Would totally recommend this company and our guide Chance, thank you so much"

Originally, we had planned to explore BA by ourselves, but having read some good reviews about Buenos Tours, we thought it would be worthwhile to do a walking tour and we are so glad we did.We reached out to Buenos Tours via their website and we had a prompt response about availability and options. We booked a half day tour of the City Centre & San Telmo, but after reading our traveller profile, Buenos Tours emailed us to tailor our tour a bit more based on our traveller profile (we were interested in seeing some Tango during the day). They suggested that instead of starting in San Telmo, we start in La Boca, where we'd have the opportunity to see tango dancers on the street and in some of the outdoor restaurants. I must say, it was a brilliant suggestion and ended up being one of our favorite parts of the trip.Ceri, our tour guide, met us at our hotel the day of the tour. It was an interesting day for a tour, as it was a public holiday and there was a peaceful (but major) protest in the city. However, Ceri, was able to maneuver us through the city with ease from our hotel to La Boca to San Telmo and finally into the city centre. As he got to know us, he directed us through the different neighborhoods to various things that we may find interesting and suggesting other things we may want to do / try after our tour (e.g. good wines, local parillas, places to explore by ourselves). One unexpected highlight was walking through the protest, which stretched from Casa Rosada to National Congress. As a foreigner, we never would have done this, but it was peaceful (albeit very large) and yet we felt perfectly safe with Ceri. It was truly an amazing experience.Thank you Ceri and Buenos Tours!"

Our guide, Ceri, is an ex-Canadian actor who has been living in this great city for a number of years. Although English is our second language, his clear speech was easy to follow, even for a slightly deaf elderly lady. He has a relaxed, friendly way of imparting his knowledge of the city's history, architecture, monuments and customs without being pedantic. Wear comfortable hiking shoes and a hat, because the distance covered is 11-12 km. Don't forget your camera! Ceri took us for coffee in the restaurant the Pope used to visit for his coffee break ( when he was still the Archbishop of Argentine) . We even ate the traditional Brazilian biscuit filled with milk jam - not recommended - too sweet! He could help us change US $ into Pesos at the best rate found during our whole 18- trip.

We and another couple were in Buenos Aires for a two days prior to taking a cruise and had set up two tours with Oliver, an American who has lived in BA for the last seven years. The first tour was on a Saturday afternoon and took us from the marriott to the famous cemetery, and the second was Sunday morning and took us down to the Rose house area. Oliver was extremely knowledgable and had many side stories about the places we visited. We all had a great time and learned a lot. Buenos Aires is a fantastic city with incredible history, and Oliver was fantastic in telling its story."

I had limited time available but was really keen to do something and the La Boca area was one area I wanted to explore further.Looking at the options available, there weren't many that would allow me to do what I wanted at times that would work with my flights. I landed on BTours and am so glad I found them.Jess was just Fantastic and accommodated the 'standard' La Boca and San Telmo walking tour to fit in with the time I had. As it turned out, we managed to fit it all in including a coffee at a truly wonderful cafe that itself had so much history. An American expat, San Telmo was Jess's local neighbourhood and as such she was able to give those extra insights that only a local can give.I would thoroughly recommend Buenos Tours and will definitely look them up again when next visiting what is becoming one of my favourite cities."

This is the first review I've ever submitted, but I want to share an outstanding \"walking\" all-day, personalized tour of the city's neighborhoods and key sites. Oliver, an American emigre to BA seven or so years ago, had a passion for showing us the real BA. He was interesting, had a sense of humor, was extremely well informed about all matters Argentine, organized, understood that safety was important to us, and committed to our having an excellent experience. Don't be put off by \"all-day walking,\" as we are in our late 60s, in just reasonably good health, and had no problem with the distances or pace. There are opportunities for breaks in addition to lunch in an interesting BA restaurant. We were a party of two, so we could take a break by sitting on a park bench listening to Oliver for a few minutes here and there. We rode the subway, guided by Oliver, crossed busy streets on foot, took taxis to and from our hotel - in short, had an adventure, secure in Oliver's presence. And the price was surprisingly reasonable.The company is excellent at communications, arranged admission to a late night tango show for us, which was also exceptional.Believe me, we've taken many bus tours during our extensive travels in retirement with mostly positive results. This private tour up close in BA, on foot and using public transportation, with Oliver, however, was in a class by itself and uniquely unforgettable."

I definitely made the right choice.My positive experience began as soon as I submitted my request through the BuenosTours website for a \u201cBA 101\u2033 Full Day Tour. Throughout the entire booking process, the customer service was excellent. I received follow-ups, confirmations and travel tips from Quincy, Alan, Justine and Oliver. This high level of customer service made me feel very good after booking my tour on-line \u2026 from the other side of the world.On the day of the tour, Oliver, my tour guide, met me at my hotel at the agree-upon time. He was a wonderful tour guide. He is very knowledgeable about BA and has a great personality. He made me feel at ease in a strange city and he truly brought BA to life with his stories. Unlike other tours, where you can feel like you\u2019re on a walking lecture, with Oliver I felt like I was exploring a beautiful city with a very knowledgeable friend.I usually don\u2019t write reviews, but as I hope you can tell, I highly recommend BuenosTours!"

Oliver was very knowledgeable about everything he showed us. We went to different areas of the city, and learned all about the history, culture, and people famous in the area, and how they contributed to Argentina. He brought the city to life with his stories and entertainment. We had planned to spend two days with Oliver, but it was pouring rain the next day, so we opted to cancel. Buenostours was very timely in returning our money because of the rain. Highly recommend Buenostours!"

His written instructions for us to meet were detailed and perfect.We met Jessica on a rainy morning in Buenos Aires. The bad weather did not spoil our plans. She is an expat from New Jersey who has lived in Buenos Aires for years. We met in the San Telmo are of the city. Not only was Jessica an excellent tour guide but also very gregarious. It did not take long for us to feel like family on a visit to a long lost relative! :-)My phone serves as a pedometer so I know we walked 6.3 miles with Jessica. I never would have guessed. We talked and talked. She really knows the city and answered all of our questions whether about history, politics, religion..whatever. I was fascinated by her explanation of the tango dance. It made so much sense . It was fun to see her act out the dance as it was intended. I could imagine the young couple on the street dancing as she described it. What fun!We saw a lot but another highlight for me was to enjoy meeting some of her friends along the way. She is certainly well-known and well-liked. One stop was for tapas and a drink. The owner learned it was my birthday and sent over a birthday treat and congratulated me in broken English. Thank goodness for Jessica...she translated everything.We saw so much and enjoyed her company so much. The sun came out and it turned to be a most memorable day! Thank you, Jessica!"

We stopped for coffee at a tango caf\u00e9, had an empanada lunch at a locals caf\u00e9, and a gelato at an Italian ice cream shop. Because she knew so much about Argentine history and inside stories of the beautiful parks and mansions we viewed, Isabel was able to make our visits to the sites especially interesting. The last stop at the Recoleta Cemetery was made more understandable since she could relate tales of the people who were placed there. I am now inspired to learn more on my own.

She met us at our hotel and before we started, she gave us an overview of her planned walk to make sure we understand where and what we would see. We had had a private car tour of the city the prior day but wanted to get a better flavor of some of the city. Jessica was tremendous in providing a historical and cultural perspective and also just explaining the differences between our customs (we are from the U.S.), and those in Buenos Aires ranging from ordering ice cream at Freddo's and Volta (WONDERFUL), to understanding the cubierto on our restaurant bills, enjoying time at a cafe and what we may want to see and do on our own. She provided great guidance on getting around and what to watch out for. As with any large city you need to be aware of your surroundings. Had we more open time on our trip we would have taken another walking tour from her or her other team members. The experience far exceeded any of our expectations. Jessica obviously enjoys helping others appreciate a city she loves."

We saw BA through the eyes of an ex-pat American who had an entirely different spin on the culture and acclamation to Argentine life. We saw the architectural, historical and political places of importance as well as the beautiful and perhaps not so beautiful aspects of life in this Argentine city. Oliver had the knack of having us at the right spot at the right time and had us take breaks at local cafes and then lunch at the oldest cafe in BA. We were all impressed by the waiters who memorize orders from 6 tables perfectly. Although the weather was ify, the 8hours passed quickly and we felt we had made a good friend as well as had the experience of a natural tour guide.

Our guide was also very happy to recommend restaurants and bars in different parts of Buenos Aires - we took his advice and had some wonderful experiences whilst we were there (I particularly liked Floreria Atlantico cocktail bar, a 'secret bar' hidden in the basement of a florists, which has wonderful food, and well-made cocktails.)"

My husband and I only had 1 day to visit Buenos Aires and were lucky enough to have Oliver, our guide, show us the most important sights in the city (titled the BA '101' tour). Having lived a number of years in Buenos Aires, Oliver was able to give us in depth details on Argentinian history as well as share what current everyday life is like. We took taxis, the metro, and, of course, we walked! Our tour covered San Telmo, Monserrat, Casa Rosada, and Recoleta Cemetery; just to name a few of the places we visited. Furthermore, we enjoyed a lovely (if slightly touristy, by our choice) lunch at the historical Cafe Tortoni. During the course of the tour, my husband's interest in South American wine became known. As our tour ended, Oliver extended his stay with us and helped my husband purchase a few bottles to take home.Furthermore, all of my interactions with the staff at BuenosTours were prompt and comprehensive. They were even able to accommodate our change of tour date without any hassle. All in all, we wouldn't have wanted to see the city any other way."

Cari, a British/Canadian origin greets us at the Plaza Hotel, on time (being on time not to be taked for granted in Argentina). I strongly recommend that you communicate your particular interests prior to arriving.We spend the first afternoon with Ceri and before starting the tour, he was kind enough to get us SIM cards.Be aware for US and EU visitors, that although the formal Excange rate is $1:$P6.8 one can get a much higher exchange rate in the \"blue market\".The old city is dilapidated and the sign of broken economy are everywhere.Our guide helped us with dinner reservations at La Cabrera steak house where the food was fantastic. Even with reservations you will wait over an hour, as time punctuation doesn't mean much here ( did I said that before?)Make sure to visit the cemetery as it is unique and gives one a glimpse of the society in buenos aires.We are stuck all day today at the local airport, trying to catch a flight to Iguazu Falls. No announcement nor customer service. one can not relay on internal flights as this is a third world economy and it feels very chaotic. When a flight finally boards, one could hear people cheering.Back to BuenosTours - highly recommended. Wonderful and reliable guide."

It was lovely to have someone to take photos of us together too!We travelled through a mixture of public transport, walking and taxis between the locations on the tour - all of these options are very cheap in BA but it is nice to have the option to experience it all at your own pace, in your own way, rather than being rushed through as part of a big group."

Note that any transportation will be paid by you (you'll need a taxi and probably bus to go to La Boca and then San Telmo.) I was hoping for much more history and fun facts about the barrio's overall and development over time. Instead it's much more focused mostly on recent history and only for a few spots along the way. Overall, the tour isn't bad or lacking knowledge, but it's definitely not worth for that kind of price. If you buy a local guide and walk around, you'll get close to the same amount of info."

If you have only one day in BA we strongly recommend one of Buenostours walking tours.

We then had a flight issue which meant we were re-routed to Rio and we went through various potential changes to our planned itinerary and timings as consequence of this - again all dealt with quickly and efficiently - which meant we felt in control and would not lose out on seeing the best bits of the city.

Our first day was San Telmo and the City Center with Ceri. Ceri was a terrific guide, he was knowledgeable, very personable and we enjoyed his sense of humor. He was very sensitive to our interests and gave us advice on what else to go see (some of our stops were closed because it was a Sunday, for example Manzana Las Luces). The second day we toured Retiro, Recoleta and the Cemetery with Alan, also a terrific guide who entertained us with his knowledge of local lore and gave us several tips on places to visit. I was especially impressed with the \"personal touch\" Alan (who learned from Ceri our interest in craft beers) gave by recommending a local \"closed door restaurant\" with craft beer dinners. Unfortunately our schedule did not allow this special experience but we truly appreciated the personalized recommendation. Both Alan and Ceri were extremely helpful with other recommendations and I suspect it is a core of the business practice at BuenosTours. I highly recommend BuenosTours for a private guided walking tour of BA (but bring good walking shoes!) I felt we left BA having made new friends."

If you are a first timer as we were and only had one day, then the BA 101 tour is the way to see the main attractions and neighbourhoods. Our lovely guide Jessica took our group of seven all over the city and consistently kept us enthralled with her knowledge of the main streets & avenues, the history plus a few unexpected quirky areas.We joined this group via a roll call on a South American cruise and as per the norm we had one-day in port. The cost split between everyone was excellent value compared to one or two people. However you would move a lot quicker or have more break time if doing this walk as a couple - just costs more. Having said that, it was great to share this scenic milieu with like-minded people.We shared the cost of a taxi from the cruise terminal to our meeting point close to San Telmo and again on the way back to the ship. Fares are a little higher coming from the port (of course) but it was a quick way from this industrial shipyard. Our guide was prompt and the meeting location got us into the San Telmo neighbourhood where she regaled us with its history. After seeing Casa Rosada and Plaza we walked to Ave. De Mayo where we had a delightful late morning break at the Caf\u00e9 Tortoni. Ignore the pretentious waiter and enjoy the ambience, the coffee and delicious cakes! Frome here Jessica took us to Plaza San Martin on the Subte (underground), which is just a couple of stops. Located in the Retiro neighbourhood this leafy and up market area is simply beautiful. Everywhere in downtown BA there is superb architecture on a par with or even more stunning then Paris.We had a late lunch of tasty empanadas, wine & beer at a local restaurant (or anything else you wanted on the menu). Food and drinks are extra but worth getting into the Argentine culture. Our last stop was La Recoleta cemetery where of course we saw Eva Peron\u2019s vault (Family Duarte). In the time we had there we also saw famous and fantastically designed tombs - on the other hand some crumbling vaults had exposed coffins which was a bit sad.Do yourselves a favour, if you are able to manage a walking tour try any of the tours on their website. They simply couldn\u2019t have given us a better day out in Buenos Aires for the money - more importantly though, they gave us their expertise!We enjoyed every moment and you will too!"

Buenos Tours have you complete a series of questions when you book (about your interests etc.) and each guide actually took the time to pre-read this and had suggestions ready to modify our tour to our interests. This was really impressive! What was also great was being sent a picture and little biography on each guide before the tour so you knew a little about your guide also! We defiantly saw more of Buenos Aires doing these tours than we would have discovered on our own. I was pregnant and also love stopping to take photos and the pace of the tours was spot-on.

            "review": "A must-do introduction to beautiful Buenos Aires for first-timers. We had a bit of a tricky time getting to Buenos Aires (airlines issues/lost luggage), but once we hit the pavement with our guide, Oliver, things began looking up. For anyone who has lost luggage, you know it's a drain, particularly after a full day in transit. We almost canceled our tour, and we are so glad we didn't. Oliver, a US expat, saw that we had little more than lightweight clothes while our heavier clothing meandered from the States to BA. Oliver made some adjustments, detouring straight away to Av. Santa Fe where we swiftly found some jackets for my two daughters (preteens -- not an easy task!). Within about 30 minutes we were officially on tour, garnering an extra site, El Ateno, for good measure.Oliver is enthusiastic and obviously loves his adoptive country. He enjoys history, local folklore and offers up a few curious urban legends during the full tour through San Telmo, Micro Central, Recoleta, to name just a few districts. He illustrated the major historical, religious, cultural (arts, tango, etc.) and political sites. He engaged not just the adults but made particular effort to engage our daughters as well, who took pride in challenging his knowledge of the symbols on the mausoleums in the Recoleta Cemetery. (Smile, Oliver!) The greatest benefit for us was that he provided an excellent foundation to create our own more detailed explorations geared to our personal interests the remainder of our stay. For these reasons and many more, I definitely recommend the full-day walking tour with Buenos Tours. The walk itself was not particularly difficult nor strenuous. The day was broken up by a snack/breakfast and lunch at some of the city's popular cafes.Buenos Aires was an incredible city with so much to offer. Not only would we return to the city, but we'd definitely give our new friends at Buenos Tours a ring to see what new offerings they might have at that time."

He presented a great balance of cultural and historical information, and is clearly very knowledgable about the city as a whole, not just the areas we walked through. We never felt rushed or hurried, and Oliver knew the answers to all of my questions, not matter how mundane or seemingly off-topic they might have seemed :) I learned a lot, and really enjoyed seeing the sights through the eyes of someone who has such a firm grasp on the local culture. Oliver was also able to make recommendations about what else to see and do during our visit, which was super helpful. My favorite part of my trip to Buenos Aires!"

Not only did we 'see the sights', but her personal reflections on the governing party, cost of living, lifestyle and the quirky, and sometimes bizarre outcomes of the decision-makers added to the feel of the city. Highlights were the morning tea stop at the atmospheric 'poets corner restaurant',the necropolis and for an avid junk fossicker like me, San Telmo. Our overriding impression was that we had barely scratched the surface and needed to go back for more, and our 2-day stopover was far too short !"

The day started in La-Boca and then progressed and included walking, bus,and using the metro around some brilliant areas of BA like San Telmo, Reocletta and all the 'must see' areas of BA . Chance's history and local knowledge was empowering, comprehensible and so fluid. Nothing was above us, the whole day was so very interactive, and well orchestrated. The stops for morning tea and lunch were wonderful choices and not only the knowledge but the confidence Chance gave us on the streets in BA set our weeks holiday up to be so enjoyable. We truly experienced close to most of BA. This is a must do tour- a must do if you only have 2 days, just as much as a must do if you have a week- this tour really leaves you loving so much about the city and close lying areas."

We went with her two separate times during our visit. She is personable, friendly, knowledgeable, punctual and plans the tours extremely well. We saw what we expected to see and she was also flexible enough to allow us extra time in one place or another if we saw something we wanted to see along the way. She also plans the tour so that mid way we would make a stop at a cafe to rest, get a snack, talk about the city and have our questions answered. Jessica was also very helpful in recommending shops and restaurants for us to explore on our own. Besides her skills as a tour guide, the fact that she was originally from the United States and we shared a common background made it easy for us to relate to her which in turn made it easier for her to compare our culture and experiences with those in Argentina. It was like having a friend with us instead of a tour guide. The time we spent with Jessica went very quickly, was most enjoyable and we would most heartily recommend her to anyone traveling to Buenos Aires."

They oriented us to the subway, they recommended they favorite out-of-the-way spots, and they explained the Buenos Aires dialect. By the time we parted ways, I felt much more like a local than I expected, which meant we could enjoy the rest of our week with that much more confidence and excitement. It's also worth noting that our flight was half a day late, yet Jessica changed her schedule to accommodate us. The folks at Buenos Tours we totally understanding and figured out a new plan on short notice. This is a great group of people."

We visited BA for the first time as a starting and ending point of a Celebrity Cruise to Antartica.Looking at the reviews, and exchanging emails prior to arrival, we were very impressed before we arrived. To have a photograph of the guide, and make contact beforehand was definitely reassuring.We took a half day tour with Chance the day we arrived, after a 13 hour flight from London - he was amazing, we must have asked him so many questions and he tailored he walk, as he learned more about us. He met us in the Hotel lobby, and made sure we were back safe - talking to others in the hotel, they had not had anything like the experience we did.On our return, we went out with Jessica again for a half day tour - she was equally as informative and fun, it felt like we were out with family. To say she was reassuring was an understatement, we were worried about our airport transfers the next day - and with no hesitation she told us to ring her if we got stuck - what service.We took the advice of the company and booked heir recommended tango show - amazing, value for money, and again better Han others in the hotel had visited, and had been charged a fortune - we were a little nervous of safety, before we arrived - not with our guides, and the tango show pick up and drop off.I would urge you, to use his tour company - faultless! We noted from the reviews that not too many Brits had used them, don't look elsewhere, they are worth every penny, and we promise you that you will not be disappointed at all."

When you spend over seven hours with a person, you really feel like you get to know them, and it was a pleasure getting to know Jessica--a girl from Jersey by way of Chicago!

Coffee at Tortoni's just exactly when we needed a break, lunch was empanadas at this great place in Recoleta we never would have found on our own. The flow of the day was the perfect pacing and you really should do a tour like this when you first get into town because you feel so familiar with Buenos Aires afterwards--like you know some of its secrets. Be sure to book the recommended tango show they advertise on their website. The opening number was one of the best choreographed numbers I have ever seen--and I had two daughters in competitive dance for over 9 years so I've seen a lot of dance. It was amazing--and the food was pretty good as well! Hi Jessica! Tom, Patti and Sara"

He answered our questions but did not seem as engaged as we would have wished--asking no questions of us, for example, about our interests or what we hoped to see and learn about during our visit to Argentina. Upon our return home, I reread a number of the reviews on TripAdvisor, and feel in retrospect that this particular tour itinerary may not have been the best choice--San Telmo and/or Recoleta (which we happily explored later on our own) might have been better. Alternatively, a longer tour might have provided a richer experience. On the 3-hour walking tour of Centro some sites were treated in a very cursory way and we might have gotten more out of a more extended visit (e.g., to the explore the tunnels and do the tour at Manzana de las Luces rather than simply walking in and out of one building). We did spend time in the interior of the cathedral and enjoyed that part of the tour and Oliver's more detailed explanation of particular features of that site. All in all, a good experience--but a bit disappointing given our high expectations."

It covered 4 areas in depth--San Telmo, Retiro, Monserrat and Recoleta, and lasted a full 7 1/2 hours. Our tour guide was Oliver. He arrived at the hotel right on time, and we hopped in a taxi to San Telmo, arriving just outside of the San Telmo market. Oliver really had a good knowledge of history of each area we walked through, and provided both the official and unofficial versions of historical events. (The unofficial versions were probably more accurate!). We stopped for coffee at the Tortoni cafe and had an empanada lunch at a charming restaurant. I would highly recommend this company and Oliver's tour as a way to get an in depth view of the main areas of Buenos Aires."

We took a quick taxi to the area where our walking tour would begin. It was a beautiful, relatively quiet morning, and we enjoyed our tour very much. Chance provided a unique perspective of life in Buenos Aires, and he imparts information very easily.

Walking the streets of BA with Jessica, enjoyingcoffee and lunch with her was like spending the day with an old friendwho'd moved to Argentina many years ago and we were all catchingup.Thanks Jess for making our stay in Buenos Aires so enjoyable. If you enjoy walking, talking, learning, sharing and smiling then book a tour with Buenos Tours. They were helpful from the first contact until the end. By booking this walking tour we had no problems walking the rest of BA during our next three days there. We also did the Tango show which really wasn't our thing but the theatre was gorgeous, the food quite good and we met a lovely table of French people so it was not a bad night."

Isabel, who had dealt with our emails at Buenos Tours had advised us that as we didn't land at EZE until 8.30am it was unlikely that we would get to our hotel until 11.00am (how right she was) the 4 hour walk would be our best option. Oliver was an excellent guide, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, informative and helpful. We learned a lot about his adopted city's culture and history in a short time. The pace was perfect for 2 very jet lagged people and we had a perfect coffee stop at Cafe Tortoni. We were really pleased we had booked the tour and Oliver was outstanding.

While he's super-knowledgeable about Buenos Aires' history and architecture, the tour never felt like a list of facts, but rather a series of vignettes with reoccurring characters and themes.We took the full day tour, beginning in La Boca. In one day, we were able to weave our way through San Telmo, Microcentro (downtown), Plaza de Mayo, Retiro, and Recoleta. We went inside famous buildings of all sorts, from churches to government buildings. We had a relaxing coffee break at the famous Cafe Tortoni and a nice empanada and salad lunch in a charming Recoleta restaurant. Our tour finished at the Recoleta Cemetery, where Alan expertly weaved his way through the maze of mausoleums, highlighting the famous (Eva Per\u00f3n) and the not-so-famous-but-interesting (a domestic servant buried just outside her employers' mausoleum). Having done all of these things, I am both surprised and delighted that the tour never felt hurried.As a two year resident of Buenos Aires, I experienced the tour in a different way from other tourists. I didn't really need Alan's accurate translations, and I already had been to most of the locations on the tour. But, for me, it was an eye-opening experience. Anyone can get a map and walk around a city. But to really understand what you are seeing, from the cannon balls embedded in a historical church tower to the graffiti painted the day before by some politically active youth, one needs a guide. Moreover, I now finally understand who all those old men on the Argentine currency are.The private tour format is a huge advantage. During our tour, we saw plenty of other tourists in large groups following lazily behing their guide. The were talking amongst themselves and had little or no connection to the guide. For us it was completely different: an engaging, personal and memorable experience."

No worrying about finding my way around or getting ripped off by taxi's. She took care of it all. She spoke English and Spanish fluently. I really can't believe how much of the city we were able to see. Quite an accomplishment. If you are worried that a full day may be too strenuous well don't be! They expertly place subway rides on 100 year old wood carts, lunches at famous cafe's, and leisurely walks throughout the tour. My guide also helped tailor the tour to my likes and wants. Something you don't typically see. Usually they are rigid schedules that you can't deviate from. She went the extra mile to make sure that it was perfect.

Jessica was of great help in locating and describing the most important features and locations there.On a walk like this a guide is a must for two reasons. First, a do it yourself walk with your head in a guidebook wouldn't come near to gaining an understanding of the locale.

We wanted to break up our return and get a bit of the city's culture. It had been 12 years since I'd been to BA and had friends with us who had never been there, so we thought the tours was the way to go. They were a real highlight of our overall Argentine experience. Alan and his team do a great job of communicating before you book, after you book and prior to arrival and the tour dates to prepare you so you get everything you possibly can out of the experience. We had four people so it was really cost effective because they were running a special of \"pay for three and the fourth is free\". We did a tour our first two mornings: San Telmo and La Boca one day and Retiro/Recoleta the second with the cemetery being a big highlight. After the first day, we knew how to use the subway and bus system thanks to those being the way we got around for the first tour. Alan lead one and Jessica the other - both excellent tour guides. We also took the company's recommendation for a tango/dinner show and it was excellent. Everything came off without a hitch, we were picked up at our accommodation by private car and taken to the show and returned afterwards as part of the price. Also a real thank you to Isabelle who communicated by email very effectively. Such a pleasure to deal with professional friendly services in a foreign city.

The tours themselves were great - my guide would meet me at my hotel, and we would then walk, cab, subway or bus our way to the tour route. Midway through, we'd have a break in a notable cafe; we'd rest our feet, have some friendly conversation and a snack, and I'd learn more about the venue and surrounding area. The excursions were excellent for me as a solo traveler, and I think they could be even more fun with one or more additional people.I had two guides; Jessica for two tours, and Oliver for one. They were both very good, and Jessica was truly outstanding. In the end, I got a fantastic introduction to many major landmarks, learned a lot of the city's and nation's history, and also benefited from practical tips on how to use public transportation, make/keep change, etc. There were a couple of places I ended up going back to for more in-depth exploration on my own, and I probably never would've discovered them if relying solely on guidebooks.

This is evident in his intelligent and humourous tour. His grasp of history is excellent. I am a history buff and knew bits of the Argentine story, but during our walking tour Allan wove it all together so we came to understand the development of not only the city but the country, along with the Argentine character.Allan's insider tips are also great for getting the most out of your time and money.We have taken many tours and this was one of the best."

In Buenos Aires, Argentina on the 28th September at 8.45 - 4.00 Pm., my wife and I arranged a private walking tour with Alan from his company Buenostours [see website above].We were met at our hotel and over the next 7 hours visited many \"out of the way\" places in the capital city, rode the oldest train, had coffee at the oldest cafe and lunch at an authentic Argentinean pizzeria. One of the many highlights was a guided tour of the Teatro Colon a magnificent Opera house, being among one of the best in the world with a special & for us a lucky female guide who sang two arias for the tour group - very special indeed. Alan organized the tickets in advance, planned the tour and was extremely pleasant and informative to be with. For anyone wishing to spend a great day walking around this magnificent city with a guide, we would highly recommend contacting Alan in advance of your visit or after arrival.

This was my first time to B.A but as I only had 2 days there i wanted a tour which was flexible to cover my interests but also ensured I'd get to see all the important attractions. My guide was Jessica a native of NJ who'd been living in B.A for a few years. So it was great as she gave me examples in the US i could relate to and she spoke fluent Spanish. What really made the trip was that Jessica was so well informed about the history and architecture of the city and took me to some off the beaten path places. She also answered all my questions very patiently and really helped me to have a great day out!!"

From the first contact with Alan, owner of Buenos Tours, until the end of our time in Buenos Aires, this was by far the most interesting tour we took there! Learning about the historical development of the city with the many personal stories, drama, myths, and legends gave us a true impression of the Argentine Culture. Digesting the causes of the rise and fall of the area neighborhoods from the working class La Boca situated along the old port to Recoleta, sipping tea at elegant caf\u00e9s, and VIP seating for Tango shows, was just a taste of our some of the experiences we had with Alan. Alan\u2019s knowledge of every inquiry whether architectural or cultural was truly impressive because it is sometimes difficult to portray the past in the present due to dramas or biased interpretations. Leaving us with a lot more knowledge and a sense of mystery combined with English humor made this tour more valuable, interesting, and enjoyable than any other we have taken. Alan\u2019s insider tips and resources for other attractions, events, transportation, and even lodging proved to be invaluable and even his contacts even helped saved us money when booking other activities in the city. Thank you Buenos Tours and Alan for a most memorable and unforgettable experience, one we will not soon forget!"

As I had never \"done tourism\" in Buenos Aires, I looked into a guided walking tour, and signed up with Buenos Tours. We were able to arrange the date and the time for our convenience, and the price was fine. Our guide, Jessica, while originally from the U.S., has lived and studied and worked in Buenos Aires for five years. My wife and I agree that Jessica was the best guide we have ever had in that she was extremely knowledgeable, objective, and a fond of relevant (for me, politics and for my wife, history and culture) information. My wife and I have traveled extensively in Latin America and Europe, and have a good basis for comparison."

She perfectly understood our needs and made our visit really enjoyable. Besides the classical sights of the center,La Boca, san Telmo we went to the Feira de Mataderos, travelled by bus, walked around,ate at market stalls and mixed up with the local people. Also saw a Tango show at the wonderful Caff\u00e8 Tortoni with dinner at a very reasonable price.It was perfect.

I booked a tour with Buenos Tours. A major appeal was the fact that my guide, Alan, met me at my hotel to start the day. Once on our way we covered several parts of the city including San Telmo, Monserat, historic city center and Recoleta. Alan was a walking encyclopedia on the history of the city. Being a teacher I loved this part of the tour. Since I was on a 7 hour tour we had a midmorning caf\u00e9 and medialunias and later empanadas for lunch. It was great and both restaurants were classics. The best part is that Alan gave me several handwritten notes for follow up to other places I wanted to see. This was a great way to learn about the city and be familiar enough with it to go exploring on my own."

One could easily be overwhelmed by a city of 13 million people, especially when your native language is not Spanish. After our tour we were comfortably and confidently navigating Buenos Aires with a familiarity that was hard to believe after only one day. Jessica met the three of us in our hotel lobby, on time, and we headed out to learn and enjoy Buenos Aires. We took a taxi to San Telmo and started to learn about the founding of the city, immigration, cultures, economy, wars, politics, religion, architecture and traditions. All of this was done as we walked through fascinating areas, stopping for coffee, drinking Mate, we toured churches, walked cobblestone streets past small brightly painted wooden houses all the way up to massive mansions. We visited Plaza de Mayo where she pointed out and described every significant building and told us about many of the events that had taken place there in the past and explained the protest signs that were there on the day of our tour. We used the Subte (subway) and we were immediately comfortable with its simplicity. We ate at a couple of really good restaurants and we worked our way through many neighborhoods until we toured the amazingly beautiful Recoleta Cemetery where she brought us to many of the most famous tombs of major military and political figures, including Evita\u2019s.  I asked Jessica no less than 100 questions throughout the tour and she had a deep knowledge of every subject. She was born in the US, so she knew what we were likely to find interesting about Buenos Aires. She certainly has a long list of sites to show you, but she also does a great job of listening to your questions to customize the tour to your tastes.  I highly recommend that you take this tour as early as possible on your visit to Buenos Aires; it will enhance the rest of your stay. Wear comfortable shoes because it is a seven hour tour on cobblestone streets and sometimes rough sidewalks."

Jessica was my tour guide (although Alan answered all of my questions via email prior to making the reservation and was very helpful). Jessica was incredibly knowedgeable. She arrived on time at my B&B. She showed me all of the main historical sights in the downtown area, including the Casa Rosada, Plaza de Mayo, Avenida 9 de Julio, etc. She was also able to navigate throught the line to have lunch at Cafe Tortini. Later on we took the Metro to Plaza Dorego and took a walking tour through San Telmo. I love to walk around cities and soak everything in, but doing so in a faraway place can be challenging. I also enjoy a good conversation. But I like to be able to converse with someone who knows the region and history. Jessica met both of these qualities! She helped me to navigate the city and she was very knowlegable. I learned a lot about Buenos Aires from her and I also enjoyed her company. I highly reccommend this tour. I did not have a lot of time to spend in Buenos Aires, but felt like I got to experience in the city because of Buenos tours.(FYI - the date of my review says August 2011 but I came in August 2010)"

Don't let the \"7 hour\" length scare you away - it is a very comfortable pace, many opportunities to rest, and many stops where the tour guide will point out interesting things to look at and offer some background information.)We had had the distinct pleasure of spending our first full day in BA doing a 7 hour walking tour with Jessica - a cheerful, young, and extremely knowledgable ex-pat American. She met us at our hotel, and we went off from there. Jessica was friendly, entertaining, and informative - we peppered her with questions all day about politics, culture (historic and pop), food, daily life, you-name-it, and she had intelligent answers for everything. We were very pleased with the tour route - many very interesting stops along the whole way, some at very obvious locations (Pink House, for example, and the Recoleta Cemetary), and some at spots that you would have never come across on your own. Food stops were also great - South American style hot chocolate and medialunas at Cafe Tortoni mid-morning, a great treat and Jessica offerred us many very interesting tidbits about the cafe, its history, and its famous clientelle. Lunch stop was a local restaurant in the Recoleta area - empanadas and provoleta - and a cold beer for the hot day! Recoleta Cemetary was our last stop, and Jessica navigated us through the maze of mausoleums, pointing out various interesting \"residents\" and offering historical information and ghost stories to boot! Should we ever make our way back down, or ever hear of someone who is on their way for a holiday, we will not hesitate to recommend Buenos Tours (and Jessica especially!). We hope Buenos Tours expands into other parts of South America, too - we'd love to have the same opportunity in another one of South America's beautiful cities!"

We love to walk...so this tour was made for us. We really enjoyed being able to ask questions at any time...and be able to hear and understand the answers. It was also extremely interesting to get the view point of a US expat living in Buenos Aires long term. We spent our full 7 hours walking...not countings a mid-day coffee and a late/long lunch at a unique local restaurant with regional specialties. We feel that you can only truly get to know a city on foot...and it was certainly true in this case. To take this tour, you need to be capable of walking several miles. If you can...we highly recommend it as the best way to see Buenos Aires up close and personal."

We decided a walking tour would be the best way to see the highlights of BA and burn off some ot the calories from the flight down to Argentina. We pre-booked with Buenos Tours and easily paid through Paypal. Our guide, Jessica, was kind enough to meet us at our hotel in Palermo Hollywood and we caught a cab downtown. I don't want to spoil the tour because not knowing what we were going to see next was part of the appeal. Suffice it to say whether you are intereted in art, architecture, historic monuments and landmarks, mass transportation, or grande cafe's, you will see it all . Our guides, Jessica and Oliver, were unflappable regardless of scope of questioning. Their knowledge of Buenas Aires from the Aboriginals to current sentiment on politicals was awesome. Without reservation, we recommend this tour, it is well worth the price!"

I was dithering between doing a standard group tour or splashing out a bit extra for a private tour. I've always had good experiences with private tours before so I went with Buenos Tours, which was recommended by a friend, and was very glad I did! I was met at my hotel by Alan, a friendly young man from England who has lived in Buenos Aires for several years. He took me around the city on a three hour tour, answered all of my questions, and gave me an insight into the city that I simply could not have got from guidebooks or group tours. His knowledge was infallible, and he made the tour feel very relaxed and informal. If you want an interesting, friendly tour, without having to worry about other people on the tour, then this is for you."

Just a quick note to say how much we enjoyed our day with you exploring the layout and history of Buenos Aires. We both felt that we got to understand the development and growth of the city so much more by spending the day with you than we could ever have wandering about with a guidebook. You brought out the details behind the facts and your extensive knowledge of all those small details in the cities history made everything we saw come alive. The remainder of our visit was certainly enriched by having that head start and we enjoyed the remaining time in BA immensely. Our trip Colonia made for the perfect antidote to the bustle of BA and I can heartily agree on the suggestion to spend a night in the town and enjoy it without the tourists. We are now thinking about a return trip to see the rest of Argentina, (or at least a large swath of it) since it has so much to offer."

After reviewing the options we decided on a personal walking tour with this company.They do various tours but we elected to do the Day Tour. This was a 7 hour private tour and the cost was US $200 - this covered up to 3 people. (US $300 for 4 - 7 people). This is the total for the group and not per person. The tour will be for your party only. They do not mix groups together or add other people. We made payment in advance via PayPal.We were staying at Hotel Madero in the fabulous harbour area full of its new hotels, restaurants, etc. Our guide was Alan who met us at our hotel at 9:30. After brief introductions we set of on our walk - Alan, myself and my wife.We are both fit and good walkers but the pace was not strenuous. The time just flew past and the sights we saw are too many to list. What I can say is that Alan is highly knowledgable and delivers the information in a relaxed manner. He took as to great places such as markets, old buildings, museums, churches, trip on the underground and the most wonderful cemetry. The dead are really very interesting! His knowledge of the city, the people, the history, architecture, etc. is excellent. On our tour we also visited an excellent cafe and a great local restaurant - Alan's recommendations for drinks and food at these places were spot on.At the end of our tour Alan also gave us recommendations for an ice cream shop and a restaurant. We visited both and loved them - can't remember the name if the ice cream shop but it was just along from the red phone boxes on the street corner. The restaurant was La Brigada.As I mentioned the time just flew past and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. Although expensive for 2 people we thought it good value - and much better than sitting on a tour bus! So unless you are on a tight budget I would encourage you to do this tour - and you will never do a bus tour again!"

He clearly tailored our tour around things that we found interesting, and helped us gain a true understanding of the city and how it has evolved. We travel a lot and never take guided tours but after seeing Buenos Tours was recommended by so many people we made the reservation - all I can say is don't hesitate, it is great value and you learn so much more than is puiblished in the travel guidebooks.

I definitely wouldn't get all the information Jessica provided us in books or on the internet. She gave us excellent explanations about the history, politics and architecture of the city. So this tour was definetely worth the money. I think you definetely experience the city in a diferent way once you know a little bit more about it and i think the diference between this tour and the others is that they present the information in a very cool and interesting way leaving out the uncessary and boring parts - awesome.

Buenos Tours was the perfect way to start our 3+ week stay in Buenos Aires. Jessica (our guide) was able to give us a very comprehensive tour of some major parts of the city and we were able to take notes of what we wanted to go back and hit later in our visit, which is very valuable. The tour helped us to get our bearings and feel more comfortable navigating the city (including taxis and the subte) making us feel more confident and excited to head out on our own as our trip progressed. The best parts about Buenos Tours is the size--the walking groups are small and only consist of those people that you sign-up with in your group (in my case, it was just the three of us!). This means that there is plenty of time for questions, photos, customization of the tour, and having longer or shorter stops based on preferences. We were given choices of when to eat (whether we wanted to follow an Argentine or typical United States schedule) and where to eat. It is customization like this and the small group size of the tour that made it truly valuable. Also worth noting is that the tour guide meets you at wherever you are staying in the city, in my case a private residence. This is incredibly helpful and valuable, as this was our first experience getting a Radio Taxi and it was nice to have a seasoned veteran help us out and teach us the cultural tricks. All in all, enough good things cannot be said about Buenos Tours. The tour guide was knowledgeable, friendly, professional, on-time, and very much on-point. The cost was incredibly reasonable, the sights were perfect, and it was the best way for my small group to feel comfortable in the city right off the bat. Our 7-hour tour seemed to pass very quickly because we were all having so much fun, learning a lot, and being so engaged by our tour guide. Highly recommended! It will definitely be remembered as a highlight of my trip to Buenos Aires."

He had answers for all of them. Standing in front of the Pink House and hearing Alan explain how, when and where Peron and Evita spoke to the crowds and how Maradona raised the World Cup from the same balcony sent chills down my spine. I leaned up against a 400 year old wall. I touched San Martin's tomb. I went for latte in a century old coffee shop. I listened to accordian (or whatever they call it) in La Boca just like the immigrants would have at the turn of the century. My sister, who lives in BA and has been on numerous bus tours, learned more about the city in 4 hours than she has in 10 years. Alan was a real gentleman and was full of knowledge and good British humour. DO NOT leave Buenos Aires without going on a tour with Alan or one of his associates. It's worth every penny!

Alan even helped us find a currency exchange that was open on a SUNDAY and gave us directions to all the best ice cream places!!! We felt like we were leaving behind a friend!! Thank you Alan!! There's no way we could have seen so much of Buenos Aires without you!!"

Jessica was extremely knowledgable and personable, she did a great job of fitting all these sights into the time. The booking was handled efficiently and the details communicated clearly in advance. Jessica met me at my hotel promptly and took me on a very interesting tour. Highly recommended."

They are professional, reliable, knowledgeable and fun! We highly recommend the Recoleta Tour. Our guide was Alan and he took us through this upscale barrio of Buenos Aires where we experienced beautiful architecture, quiet streets and cafes. The most spectacular part of this 3 hour tour is the walk through the Recoleta Cemetery. While the tombs are magnificent to admire, even better is the history Alan reveals with each gravesite. An experience that will transport you back in time. In addition to his knowledge of the city's history Alan shares his personal experiences living in Buenos Aires, cultural nuances and best of all his favorite places to dine! Many tours are canned responses, not with Buenos Aires Tours; Alan and all the guides cater the tour to your interests. With so many activities to experience this is truly one tour that will provide you with the essence of the city. My husband and I travel extensively and have taken many city tours. Alan is terrific! He is passionate about life and history and will make the city come alive."

Jessica, the guide, was an American expat who has lived in BA for 3 years and has a degree in literature and history. She was extremely knowledgeable and personable and the perfect resource for anyone that wants to understand more about the history and the culture of BA. The tour was worth every penny, highly recommended."

Fantastic way to get to know and understand the city. A fair bit of walking, but well worth the effort. Great choice of coffee shop and local lunch restaurant. Would highly recommend it. Painless to book, and very speedy communication. 5*"

We booked the 7 hour walking tour with BuenosTours and enjoyed every minute of it. Jessica, our guide, was a young American student who had a clear affection for her adopted city and its history. I've given walking tours myself and you can tell when someone is just reading a script versus sharing their enthusiasm. At the end of the day, we were tired but I had an understanding of the how the city is laid out and its history. It was also fascinating to hear about Jessica's experiences living in BA. We also went to the Piazzolla Tango show recommended by BuenosTours. A tango show might be touristy but I thought this one was excellent. The theater is beautiful. Many styles of tango were danced. The dances were interspersed with songs and it was a very entertaining show."

Buenos Aires was our second stop and we did a lot of research to find a walking tour of Buenos Aires that was in English. We read many good reviews of Buenos Tours and sure enough, the reviews held true! Alan was a fabulous host of the city and was extremely accomodating. He stopped for pictures, answered any and all questions and really gave us a real great firsthand experience of Buenos Aires. He met us at our hotel and took us all over the city for a good 6-8 hours worth of sightseeing.We rode on the city's first subway car (found out Buenos Aires was one of the first 7 cities in the world to have an underground subway system), had a snack at the city's most famous cafe, ate some amazing Empanadas at a smaller restaurant and many other things.I'd recommend Alan and this tour to anyone else visiting Buenos Aires. He's lived there for 5+ years and knows the city in and out. Top notch experience...."

Buenos Tours\u2019 seven-hour private walking tour of central Buenos Aires was the perfect orientation to the city on our first full day there, not to mention being a completely enjoyable day with our guide (and company founder) Alan, a young Brit full of enthusiasm for the city. Alan not only provided the facts and figures of the key tourist sites, he shared enough of his expat experience in BA that we parted at the end of the day well supplied with recommendations and prepared to dive deep into porte\u00f1o life for the remainder of our holiday. The tour began in San Telmo and worked its way to the Plaza de Mayo and its environs, eventually taking us through Retiro and Recoleta on foot and by subway before concluding with a walk through Recoleta cemetery. Alan\u2019s wide-ranging and impressively deep narration encompassed topics from architecture to history to politics, economics, urban planning, culture, society and more \u2013 all relevant to where we were standing at that moment and placing Buenos Aires in its proper (and highly entertaining) context.Alan displayed sensitivity to our tastes and desires, and as he got to know us over the course of the day his recommendations for activities, places and events dovetailed nicely with what we wanted to learn. These included a peripatetic wine tasting in Palermo (http://www.winetoururbano.com.ar) that provided an excellent introduction both to Argentine wine and to the Palermo Soho neighborhood, a caf\u00e9 in Boedo that gave us the perfect tourist-free porte\u00f1o experience, advice on attending a Boca Juniors football game, and much more. He also taught us how to board a city bus (which is an oddly overcomplicated transaction in BA), and advised us which bus lines would serve our needs.In true Buenos Tours form, as Alan made his goodbye he pointed across the street toward a bar he likes that brews its own beer. And by then we really needed to sit down so it was much appreciated.Thanks, Alan!"

I have never enjoyed myself more on any tour! Jessica immediately got to know us and made us feel like we were walking around with an old friend who just happened to live in Buenos Aires! She answered any question we could throw her way and then gave us really interesting and fun information about each place we saw in Buenos Aires. Like any big city, it's a large place and seems kind of cold at first if you don't know anybody. However, having a guide who knows the place instantly makes Buenos Aires sparkle! I would recommend this tour for any audience. The guides will fit it to your interests and I promise you won't be disappointed!"

Tennis shoes, water, Camera & money (small change) Get lots of small change. The Subte & busses are so cheap and paid with nickel. Taxis are very affordable. The 7hour tour with Alan was so worth it. We covered alot and there was a lot to hear & see about BA. Tortonis was cool. Alteno Awsomely beautiful. Restuarant c\\o Viamonte & Rodriguez Pena meat was so good. You have to buy 2prs of Tango shoes. Could eat tons of Dulce de Leche! Havanna Alfajor a must. La Defense, Caminito, Recoleta, La Boca, Puerto Madero.Retiro. All a must to see. To walk was safe, keep your valuables close to your body and not in bags with easy accessible pockets. Leather shoes are good buys. Check your change from small side cafes where you buy sweets and cooldrinks. When using a taxi, make sure the car is clean, driver has a name tag hanging on the back seat, use Radio Taxi. If in doudt don't use the driver but most are very good with change and slips. If I had more time I would have definitely done more tours with Alan. The tours are VERY informative with lots of good details. Alan always notified me that he was on his way. Very friendly and polite and I had lots of fun with him. He is very attentive to detail and is punctual with emails. I would certainly recommend Buenos Aires Private Walking Tours as a starting point in BA. You won't regret the time with Alan."

Alan is the founder of the tour group and has multiple other well experienced guides working with him taking individuals (or small parties) around BA for private walking tours. The amount I was able to learn about the culture, turbulent political history, food, architecture and also activities of this remarkable city and surrounding areas in that 7 hours (1 day) has set up my fortnight to be a highly productive and fascinating period to understand this place well. I have been able to smatter my schedule with dates/times with upcoming activities to truly immerse myself in the culture during this stay. Alan is able to highlight some very key reasons why this city has formed like it has and delves into the underbelly of BA to provide a rare and somewhat unique insight his five years of living in the city (from his UK upbringing) has afforded him and his clients. I highly recommend contacting Alan and booking him or one of his team members for a wonderful introduction to Argentina, specifically, Buenos Aires. Regards,Scott Crank"

We arrived into Buenos Aires early on a Friday morning and immediately met with Jessica, a guide with Buenos Tours who was US ex pat living in Argentina, who took us on a walking tour of Buenos Aires for 7+ hours. The tour was a great way for us to orient ourselves into the bustling elegance and style of this great city. Jessica's knwoledge of Buenos Aires goes beyond that of most tour guides, and she was both professional, likeable, and genuine. Also, Alan at Buenos Tours who owns/manages the operation is a great resource and makes it easy to schedule a tour and provide you with links and refences of other things to see and do in Buenos Aires. Finally Jessica listened to our needs and desires while on vacation and assisted our efforts to line up activities and experiences that will always be remembered long after the 35mm's have been developed and credit cards paid."

The first time around I booked a private, full-day walking tour with Alan, and he absolutely delivered! He engaged all of us with a highly informative and well-planned tour. Alan's pleasant, easy-going style mixed with a touch of classic British wit resulted in an outing that was truly memorable. My parents raved about the tour, and I scheduled a second tour for my dad and his wife when they returned for a visit a year later. Jessica, an American expat living in Buenos Aires, was the guide for the second tour, and she was also very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the city. Buenos Tours is a first rate operation - don't hesitate to use their services."

They went over and above their duties and showed us so many wonderful sights. I would and will strongly recommend this company and specifically Alan & Melanie. We were able to see so much more than being driven around on a bus. Our tours were half day tours, with stops for coffee. We visited this wonderful city by walking, local transit and private van. Do not hesitate to book this company asking for these guides. ...............Phyllis Robertson"
