There's a cornucopia of performing animals all there to relieve you of your dirhams, there are stalls selling everything from superb and salty pistachio nuts to tables covered in used teeth, molars, incisors but not a great deal of wisdom! You will experience and olfactory overload with a variety of food on show from koftas to tangy tagines. Indeed some of the ingredients aren't even dead yet; one man was carrying around a fistful of live chickens! Take your camera and shoot from the hip. It's barking!!"

A lot of other reviews say about the snake charmers and monkey men, forcing you to pay for pictures, just avoid them. Walk around them and they won't bother you. We had a lot of fun here, just don't leave your common sense at the airport."

Had dinner in the market place (Aisha, stool one) it was pleasant to see it run by two sisters in this very dominant male culture.There were snakes and monkeys on chains (not a fan of animals being used for circus). The restaurants around are expensive. It s better to eat at a stool. Make sure you choose a busy one so you know the food is freshly cooked.Walked all the way to the big mosque. Watch out for pickpockets. Do not stop and watch the little shows, that is where they will try to get you.Overall: Use hand sanitiser before eating and keep moving"

You need your wits about you and a big dose of humour for fending off the touts advertising their own particular food stall.Personally, I found the monkey and snake exhibits in the square outrageous, inhumane and very upsetting. I despise the people who pay to have their photo taken with the poor monkeys who are dressed in nappies and desperately pulling away from their neck chains and sincerely hope you won't be one of them."

It's great--the people are crazy, the crowds are crazy, the food is pretty great (the snails taste like boogers though... just saved you a meal). *Watch your belongings* as the child thieves are brazen (I caught a girl with her hand in my back pocket fishing for a wallet while two other little boys \"accidentally\" ran into me). That's to be expected for any big bustling touristy area like this, so don't let it deter you. Its an amazing place. Watch out for the cobras all over (their mouths have been sewed/permanently glued shut--which is awful, but that's the way the world works I suppose), weird monkeys and apes, and all sorts of other critters and creeping things. Make sure you go both during the day and night to really appreciate how cool the setups are. Pretty much any tangible goods you'll find here are completely worthless, but you'll pay a premium and people will bold face lie to you about quality and who made it. If you're cool with that, it's fun. Otherwise get your goods elsewhere (especially rugs... please don't buy them here--they're garbage). Anyways, this place is a sight to behold, and it's worth a few hours of your time. Watch your things, don't buy stuff (the orange juice is awesome though--try to get some Pomegranate if they have any, if it's cold at night see if they have any Khodanjal (its a cinnamon spiced drink--tastes like you're drinking Big Red Chewing Gum--it will wake your mouth up for sure)-- Cart No. 70 has good stuff (I have no basis of comparison but that's where I got mine and it was weird--didn't drink it all, but glad I tried it).Also make sure you get some mint tea and watch the sunset over the square. It's fun and relaxing!"

As long as your are sensible and keep any cash/valuables tuck away safely, ideally in a zip up pocket or money belt, then you can enjoy this amazing spectacle. I must point out that I would take the same precautions spending a day in any busy city centre. Marrakech is by no means exceptional for problems with petty crime.We found hawkers etc to be easily deterred as long as you remain firm and polite.The evening set up is exciting and well worth enjoying, from impromptu street fights, great selection of street food, fizzy drink fishing, on the spot dentists (dont..!!!), snake charmers and monkeys (the later two we fundamentally disagree with and therefore never engage with).Atmospheric, noisy, lively, colourful.......great."

But here\u2019s a tip for those who do not speak Arabic and actually do not understand the performance: In the Medina there\u2019s also Dar Bellarj, a former birds (storks) hospital, now a cultural institution; you can find in in TripAdvisor as well, it is not far from Jemaa el-fnaa. Currently they have an exhibition on the performers in Jemaa el-fnaa, including documentary films where they interview performers. The films have English translation, and you get to understand much better what is happening in the square. Entrance is free. Recommended!"

Prepared to be hassled by various sellers a lot and if you don't want to ideally don't make eye contact or engage in conversation particularly with young men under 25 who may try to take you off to a particular shop or souk where they will get a commission.

At least in the souk you walk out with something here it's just a photo or a memory that will cost you. Some like it but others find it too much of a tourist trap but as the main gateway to the souk you can't really avoid it so may as well try to enjoy or just walk as quickly as you can through it."

The food stalls where rows upon rows of outside stalls selling all sorts of foods from goat heads to beautiful petite fours. I personally wasn't brave enough to eat but plenty were! Watch out for the henna women though, they're speedy and before you know it they will have you! Girls we met paid 300 dirhams for tattoos that lasted 2/3 days not the 30 days they claimed they would last.We went to one of the many cafes that had a roof terrace to take photos.. amazing sights!!"

Lots of questionable looking characters there either to pick your pocket by slight of hand, or by persuasion. We didn't have any thievery, except by those selling food in the temporary tents. We ordered one plate of lamb squeezers (40) and one chicken Pastilla(30). Two plates of skewers later, we had only a quarter of a Pastilla served with a piece of eggplant. The bill should have been 70dh but it was 250! They charged us for double orders plus \"salad\". The table beside us argued their bill, but my husband prefers to avoid conflict.

In the evening, Jemaa El-Fnaa was lively, exciting and fun! There were a number of entertainments on going to suit everyone (adults and children) and all of them were free, most of the time! You were expected to pay/give a tip to many of the entertainers as this was their way of earning money. But most of them deserved it, as they were hugely talented. The square really came to life in the evening around 18:30 when the food stalls were set up. There were open grills cooking fresh meat right by your side. Many of the restaurants also offered free delicious mint tea after too. The only thing I would say about the square is that be wary of your bag as it gets very busy and if you're going alone as a female, be wary of yourself as there were many touchy/feely men out there trying their luck! Try visiting one of the panoramic view restaurants during the evening or day to get a beautiful view of the square and its surroundings.During the day, the square does not have the eateries and entertainers set up although there are still a few entertainers such as monkeys/snakes, talented henna artists and dancers around. The square is joined to the large souk which would easily take up your full day to explore. Be careful of the traffic of cars, bikes and horses travelling through the square though as I witnessed a few near misses! There are many restaurants and food places around the square for you to eat during the day. Lastly, the square has many fresh orange juice stalls which I would highly recommend! It is perfect to help you cool down and take a break during the scorching heat... Many workers of the stall will most likely coax you in anyway and you can't walk by the stalls without being caught! Would highly recommend to all- Enjoy!"

You have to be on the alert and have your wits about you, so that you don't get conned (or talked into paying for something you don't want). A few sellers here - when I wouldn't pay what they asked - reduced the price when we walked away. So walking away can be a good tactic to get items reduced. Some sellers follow you, if you've shown interest in their goods- they don't want to let you go. Although this was a bit harrassing, we didn't feel threatened at all. Most sellers are nice. Beware of anyone drawing henna tattoos on you, before you've had a chance to refuse- or agree on a price. Somple we talked to had been charged bout 400 dirhams and some had paid 600. Far too much- locals pay about 30 dirhams for henna tattoos. We enjoyed our experiences here, but I did feel harrassed at the end of it. It wouldn't suit everyone - we met some people who really didn't like it at all. And of course, you have to like shopping. We did get quite good at haggling down prices and got some bargains. Then we went to a rooftop bar and watched the activity below- that was great."

The stalls are all very similar; but be aware that the bread/olives/harissa they bring to your table come at a price! We paid 150dh each night for two, which is still pretty reasonable, but restaurants near the square are often cheaper, with less hassle! Still one not to be missed, especially the music, snake charmers and storytellers!"

This is something else ..A sudden burst of colours and chaos and frenzy and madness..a hyperbole of adjectives could be less specially when marrakesh happens to be your last halt right after touring around morocco..The sudden refinement..the sudden cosmopolitan pulse ..the sea of white skin and blonde hair healthily mixed amid motley locals in variety of grabs is intoxicating .Jmaa el fena is life itself ..it beckons u at night ..it beckons u in the morning ..Right at 6.30pm..it comes alive with all hustlers and hawkers selling your wares ..entertainers galore ..food carts and henna aetistes.. ersatz perfumes and ersatz oils clamoring for your attention visavis the brick and mortar shops ..Go enjoy the experience ..music is rife ..and colour is unmistable ..jma it is !!!!And the souks surrounding it which meander from one gully to other is a labyrinth no doubt but wondrous ..Reams and reams of Moroccan glasses.. morrocan lamps ,wares..leather lovelies , tagine pots and shoes and Chinese duplicates and what not .. And it's amazing how they all quote different prices for similar things ..find your thing around..u will figure how to.haggle and where to make a full stop.usually; less than half the rate is correct .Remember one thing though .Moroccan hawkers and sellers are agressive,pushy and emotional .They lure u.they beckon u..they psstt you and drag u in their shop .u only need to look.casually at something and u can be rest assured; u ain't getting out in a hurry..They force u to quote a rate and incase u don't want it ..they get emotional and huff and puff as though u wasted their time .It's alarming sometimes and u need to be firm for no pushing ..Yet they are harmless.. it's just their way..It's actually fun how they operate and live ..observing small nuances and small cultural ethnical differences in humans ..Something that segregates their reactions from maybe ours ..Another warning ...Don't buy argan oil from just about anywhere . They could be fake .Right rate is around 500dirhams for a lite and purchased best from an apothecary. .best reverence is rehba kadima.shop no 156 brahims..the purest and original ..tried and tested ..or pick from essouairia..Also don't have the oily street food at jemaa.Unless u don't value your intestines ..stick to fresh grills and no tagine ..enjoy the orange juice and juggler acts galore at the square ..Don't miss the live band of musicians who drum themselves out mad at around 7pm..it's such fun.."

It was so buzzing at night but I don't feel like anything was really going on. There are people standing in circles around different performers but to me it wasn't worth anything to watch. i'm glad I went and experienced the energy, culture, and history but found myself underwhelmed by it all. Be careful of the henna ladies grabbing your arms. I saw a lot of that (but didn't experience it perhaps because I'm a guy). yes the vendors will be pushy and follow you around but a few firm and polite no thank yours (no merci, la choukran) will drive them away..it also works if you can walk quickly to get away from them. I also found if you say no thank you and put your right hand over your heart while bowing head, it will also cause them to not be so pushy. Also, it works if you act like you cant speak English or French- they will realize they cant communicate with you and will leave you alone. Do stop by the many orange stands to drink a glass of orange juice. to conclude...you cant not go if youre in Marrakech, but keep your expectations low but your wits high. Go to experience the energy and hustle/bustle."

We watched the vendors set up the food stands and eventually ate at booth number 1. Do not miss visiting Jemaa El Fnaa during the evening. The food is excellant and very reasonable. For 100 Dirhams we had chicken skewers, vegetable skewers, chicken tangine and bread. When we ordered we thought we would have one small skewer with about 7 small pieces of chicken. What we received were about 5 or 6 skewers with approximately 7 small pieces of chicken on each skewer. It was more food than we could finish. The tangine was excellent. The highlight is just hearing all the sounds coming from the performers in the square and the great aromas from the food vendors cooking their food. The smells, noise, and mass of people make this an exceptional experience that you should not miss if you are visiting Marrakech."

Food control: be sure u eat in a clean place cause as u can see they don't use fridge so is very dangerous during hot time and u dont know for how long food was out of fridge.But don't be afraid if u want to try the experience is nice and very folklore, just be careful.I did an intoxication once and from there i go here for eating but i choose always the same restaurent where now i am sure to eat safe."

It took us awhike to find it but we were just strolling around with no local map which would of made it easier. There's musicians, street performers, snake charmers, lads with monkeys doing tricks and locals selling anything from cigarettes to gold and leather. My mate wanted to go to the food souks but my god are you absolutely plagued by locals shoving menus in your face, literally one person from one stall on your left and another from the stall right next to it on your rightshoving a menu at you all promising the best food in Morocco and they have all the tricks and short greetings in most languages. One fella was spouting off some \"Gaeilge\" to us to even get us in. It's all the same stuff, lovely jovely, why walk down there when you can just get the same here. As soon as theh see you're not interested they're gone to the next. We eventually sat down at one food souk, I wasn't eating as I wasn't hungry. We were having fun with the cooks, posing for photos and then when I wasn't eating he said sorry but the seats are inly for 2 people eating so up we got and left. Walked through another aisle of stalls with more locals trying to get us seated to eat and at this stage I was so fed up with them and couldn't wait to get as far away as possible from them. So be prepared for all of this, including street traders and you will be fine. It's definitely worth a visit though. I'd say we stayed there for about 1 hour. A better option would be to find a good restaurant that overlooks the square, eat there and get a birdseye view of all the madness from one of the restaurant terraces."

It is a large open-air square filled with people selling food, drinks and various items (primarily souvenir related) or services (like pictures with monkeys, guys dressed up in stereotypical Moroccan wear and women doing Henna). Everything is negotiated in here. There are also various performances usually at night time and that is really when the square becomes alive. And hot food stalls also set up during the evening. Men singing and playing instruments in circles throughout the square while audiences build up around each circle.I think what is really important for people is to know that it will get busy and chaotic here. This is something you need to prepare yourself for and a fact you need to accept before coming into this area. It is possible that this is not everyone's ideal space to be in so that is something to consider.Also do not be gullible. People will try to sell you something or invite you in to something you may not necessarily want. For example one of the men dressed up in Moroccan wear tried to invite me to wear a Fez hat and take a picture with them as my boyfriend and I walked past. It all happened so fast and they just about put the hat on my head (without my permission). I quickly tried to brush the hat off and politely declined and walked away because I did not want to pay for the photograph with them. If you want this photograph and are willing to pay then this is all totally fine: they are very friendly. But do not assume they are being friendly because they randomly want to be your friend. They are trying to sell you something. That is business. So it is important to be aware of that to have a safe and good experience in the square.I rate this site 5 circles because it is truly a one of a kind experience that I enjoyed. Keep your wits about you and you will have a great time exploring the square and seeing the performances."

It's also sad to see all the poor monkeys in diapers on chains taking pictures. Basically anyone you take a picture of/near will ask for money, so be prepared to either pay or argue.

The souks leading off it provide a myriad of streets (over a 1000) we were told housing everything you can think of. Yes we were approached by sellers and their wares but nobody was unpleasant. Haggling is expected and I would advise trying a few places for the thing you want to measure reaction. If you walk away and they don't follow you have hit below their price! DO have a price in mind before you start the process. We walked to and from the square at night and felt perfectly OK. Crossing the street can be interesting.

Every evening (7 days per week, don't believe it if you're told otherwise!) the square and surrounding souks come alive. In the day it's all tourists, in the evening locals come out and join the crowds around storytellers and artists. The noise, the hectic hubbub, make for an electric atmosphere. The street food is amazing and the souks are fun if you feel like haggling for something and don't mind the typical marketplace pushiness. A word on this, and also a couple of tips... I strongly recommend taking Marrakech, and the souks in particular, as an experience. What I mean by that is that it is illogical to come to a place known for its markets and bartering and not expect some quite determined salesmen! This is their living and they are working hard for it, personally I absorb their insistence with enjoyment as part of the whole spectacle. If you don't want something, be polite, firm and walk away. You may have to put aside the manners you would expect to use at home and walk away with someone still trying to talk to you, but then again, you're not at home...Regarding bartering, DO! It's part of the way of life. There are a few places where prices are set (such as the artisans complex a couple km to the south) but not in the market stalls. As a (very) general guide, I would halve the first price they offer and then only pay maybe 10 dirhams more. Obviously this is relative to the product. The best method I found was to try offering a price I thought was fair -to-low and see the reaction. If they look nonplussed but continue in conversation, you can probably get them to that figure or close (it's simple good haggling to give a little!)If the stall holder freely steps back and lets you leave, without any attempt to keep you engaged, you know it's too low. Then you can adjust at the next stall until you hit the mark. Don't worry about finding the same thing again, I can guarantee you will!As for non-shopping tips, just beware the snake charmers and henna 'tattooists'. They can loop a snake around your neck to pose for a photo or grab your hand to start drawing and then will expect payment. Be insistent and pull your hand away; don't be afraid to put a snake (or anything else put on you) on the ground to be able to walk away, but do it immediately and don't take photos, as by that point you will be pretty much obliged.Biggest tip: relax and enjoy the craziness. It's a blast to the senses but a good one."

Great place to hang out and people watch, see the local entertainers singing, dancing, telling stories etc. The snake charmers, dancers, monkey guys etc will want to take money off you of you have photos taken with them so just be aware, but enjoy it! many many stalls here during the day and more in the evening with the food stalls (almost like mini restaurants)...you'll get a bit of pressure from the touts who are there to bring people in, with shouts of \"takes you to heaven\" etc...oh and expect to be introduced to \"Moroccan Jamie Oliver\" at almost every stall! Most of the food is pretty much the same everywhere so pick the one that makes you feel most comfortable or the right budget for you (we had a filling meal of couscous, tagine, bread, olives, salad and mixed kebabs, with a coke and complimemtary mint tea at the end, for around 170 Dirrhams, which worked out around \u00a315 for 2 people, so it's not exactly expensive for what you get).Restaurants around the Jemaa will charge a little more but again you pay your money and take your choice and you shouldn't have much trouble...most of them have at least one waiter who will speak more than one language so you should be able to find somewhere with staff who speak your language.Henna \"tattoos\" are very overpriced here for tourists...the back of one hand should cost no more than 25-35 Dirrham...they'll ask for between 300 and 400 so beware of this, agree prices for anything beforehand and hold the money in your hand so they can see what they will get, so no misunderstandings, and pay on completion, smile sweetly and walk away. Photos with street entertainers will also cost you but pay a modest amount and don't get into a long drawn out discussion about it...at the end of the day it's just a photo and you have the rest of your holiday to get on with so don't let one experience spoil the time...a good tip is to keep maybe 20-50 Dirrhams in your pocket for such an eventuality if you WANT a photo...and ask them for one, tell them what you are willing to pay, agree and pay what you agreed and be polite but firm.Most people are polite and friendly here, just be firm if the pressure builds too much, and walk away with a firm \"merci, Non\" or \"Shukran\" (thank you in Arabic)The atmosphere at night is soooooooooooo different, you really must visit in the evening...we had warnings about pickpockets etc but in the entire week (and we were out and about almost all day every day) we never had any problems with pickpocket attempts or any kind of aggression from anyone.You can also hire a horse drawn carriage from the square for a tour around the Medina...again agree prices beforehand!

Anything and everything you could possibly want shopping wise is to be found and all the fun is in the haggling! Remember to aim for a third of the price initially given by seller, its all part of the fun to barter and negotiate the final price! Food stalls are superb quality and excellent prices as are the rooftop restaurants that provide spectacular views of the human jungle that lies below. Cobras, berber tribal musicians and the freshest orange juices known to man all lie in its maze of artisan and cultural epicentre. I felt extremely safe and welcome by the locals at all times not just in the square but throughout the entire city. One day I will be back, Inshallah."

You can watch the sun set for a rooftop bar nearby, and watch the food stalls light up and the people come to eat, and it's mesmerising. The chanting from the mosques is incredibly atmospheric, and the smoke from the barbecues in the square smells mouthwatering.Down in the square, there is a huge assortment of food, from a plate of french fries to a roasted goat head, and everything in-between. Plenty for vegetarians. And the orange juice stalls sell the best freshly squeezed orange juice from the sweetest of oranges.If you're visiting Marrakech, there is no way you'll be able to miss this, but it is really worth a visit at night.

If you\u2019re thinking of going to Marrakech and haven\u2019t booked anything, do you & yours a favour and give this forgettable, over-rated part of the world a wide berth. I\u2019m at a loss as to how this place gets 5 star reviews, but hey, each to their own. I\u2019ve roughed it in similar countries over the years and have had better, far more interesting experiences. Anyhow, on the face of it, Jemaa el-Fnaa is a huge square that promises exciting insights into North African culture that might make you want to jump right in to gorge the senses. Scratch the surface though, and it really is just a massive dump full of rip-off merchants and folk who are about as sincere as the depth of your wallet. As for the hype about the souks, they are about as interesting as a glorified flea market\u2026if the merchandise looks like a bargain of the century, it\u2019s probably junk. On the other hand, if you haggle hard enough in the belief that you\u2019ll bag a quality item, you might strike lucky, but chances are you\u2019ll be screwed, and will probably feel confused and good about it at the same time. And watch out for those crazies on scooters & motorbikes that whiz about in the tiny alleyways in the souks, and that don\u2019t stop for man, child, let alone a woman. On the subject of women, I would rate this place a no-go zone unless you don\u2019t mind being constantly leered at\u2026and don\u2019t think that having a strong male by your side will deter these wannabe suitors with their tacky charm offensive. You won\u2019t feel any more protected by the occasional presence of the local armed police around the square, as their record is apparently mute on the subject.So despite this well-intentioned heads-up, should you still feel the urge to visit this area, here are a few tips:-Carry small notes at all times and do not produce your wallet/purse unless a deal is struck\u2026what\u2019s makes a good deal is difficult to tell because of the generally crappy quality of the goods, but whatever they quote first up, offer at least half that\u2026.and be prepared to simply walk away as it tends to concentrate minds.-Beware of locals befriending you as you walk along and start telling you in earnest how they want to learn your language\u2026these guys works in groups and will do their utmost to walk & talk you into some relative\u2019s rip-off store.-The main tannery in the souks is touted as worth seeing\u2026.it\u2019s stinks like hell and is nothing special and could end up being a bad experience if intimated into buying something you probably don\u2019t want\u2026also, as it\u2019s deep into the souks, you may end having to pay some ropey local to navigate you back to the main square.-Don\u2019t even look sideways at those snake-charmers who will latch onto you and try with their toothless grins to wrap a snake around you and then aggressively demand money off you.-Some will say you\u2019ve gotta to try the fresh orange juice from the open stalls in the square\u2026.we tried 4 different stalls all offering different quality (usually watered down), but none nearly as good as Tropicana\u2026seriously!-The ultimate hypocrisy was the woman in full burka regalia who desperately tried to seize my adult son\u2019s wrist to scrawl a henna ink design on. Dare any male tourist to grab this dame\u2019s hand back as it would seriously offend the whole of that world. And by the way, the henna ink they use is by all accounts lousy quality, but once they get you by the wrist you\u2019ll be squeezed hard for money. These are just a handful of experiences that my particular group and many others we met on the trip experienced in Marrakech\u2026in short, these people don\u2019t deserve your hard earned tourist dollars."

The guys in our group were several times called skinheads as we walked past and we were a group of 40-50 year olds not young teenagers! It may have been their way of trying to be funny and mock the different English dialects but we found it very distasteful and down right rude!

Visited September 2016 as a couple, and as a group of 4.The Jemaa el-Fnaa (or as people called it, \"the big square\") is easy to find, has plenty of places to eat or drink, shops and various sights.It is a bit lack-luster in the morning and during the day, with the most activity being getting set-up for the evening. And it is the evening when the big square is at it's busiest. It is a real hub of activity as it gets later, with story tellers and musicians (but this is in Arabic), snake charmers, monkey handlers, \"sales people\", and food stalls.The food stalls sell really tasty food at low prices, and amongst all the touting / competition for your custom the people are actually pretty friendly and funny at the stalls.Having visited the big square 3-4 times and at different times of the day I can say that it doesn't compare to other sights of Marrakech. The snake charmers and monkey handlers will demand high prices for those pictures you're taking (unless you're very subtle), many people will tout for your business (best drinks in town), and the worst offenders are the woman who will grab the hands of your nearest and start drawing henna without warning. Of course everything is taken in light spirit, as the local people are much more to the point and crafty compared to the humble Englishman!The cafes do not even compare to the stalls for food, on both price and taste, but they do offer fantastic views of the square. The best thing about this place is the view during late evening, while drinking a refreshing lemonade or eating (expensive) ice-cream on one of the terraces.Tip: take a break by the carts and buy some freshly pressed orange juice. They are so cheap and delicious! If you're worried about hygiene, ask them to make it into your own flask or use a straw.Overall it felt too touristy and less charming, I certainly had higher expectations. It is not the best thing about Marrakech.3 1/2 stars (if I could give 1/2)."

There were good souvenir shops where you can practice your haggling skills. There were locals and monkeys posing with tourists but you have to ask for the price first otherwise you'll get ripped off. I was asked to pay 200 Moroccan dirhams for a photo with a monkey which was ridiculous! Of course I didn't that amount but paid 40 dirhams which some say is still a lot. I could have paid just 20 dirhams. Be careful taking photos of the snake charmers as they were very quick to ask for money and they will follow you everywhere should you decline. A lot of horse carriage around. There were local women who offers henna tattoo. The place goes lively esp at night when people starts to open their eatery for good moroccan food. Some tourists have tea in the elevated terraces to watch the lovely moroccan sunset."

It's a nice place to grab a very cheap fruit juice, we didn't eat from any of the stalls but food was plentiful if you fancy it.We found the market and surrounding souks very pushy, in the main not very friendly and I favoured other parts of the city (Mellah and Kasbah). If you take photos of anyone they will actually chase you demanding payment, which isn't that much fun.I'd say go and have a walk around, soak it up but head for a drink on a terrace to enjoy the lovely sunset in a more peaceful surrounding."

The Jemaa el-Fna is certainly touted as the main sight to see (and experience) in Marrakech, but I found it to be a bit of an overrated distraction. The Medina has much more to offer in the winding alleys, souks, riads and courtyards than the carnival atmosphere in this touristy square. (By the way, touristy does nit necessarily mean foreign - the vast majority of people there were Moroccan). Definitely stop by to check it out at different times of the day during a visit to Marrakech (or if you only go once, go in the evening), but don't make this the main objective of a trip here. The food was unappetizing and stalls uncomfortable, while the entertainment was largely unimpressive with little true talent on display. Nothing of quality to buy, either. Don't miss it if here, but don't plan a trip around it either."

Many are friendly and will just point you in the right direction, without hassling you. Some will say they work at your hotel. They do not work at your hotel! If you follow them, they will most likely take you to shops (where they will get commission if you buy something) or will provide you with a tour, expect to tip them you do this. Some will say they are a tour guide, most are and will show you their I.D, but again they will want paying. Once in the square it is very busy, have bags close to your body. Cyclists, cars and mopeds will travel very quickly, alongside donkey carts make sure you have your wits about you. On foot, again they will make conversation with you and try to get you inside their shop. If you venture into the middle of the square you will see many shops with a fixed price which is reasonable. I did try to haggle with them, even on a fixed price but they did not budge. You will see snake charmers, entertainers and monkey. All saying take a picture, again for a price. I had picture with a monkey, he wanted 200dirhams, then dropped to 100, then 50. I gave him my loose change and I would not give him anymore. He even said before taking photos, I will accept any amount of money, but then it changed to only accepting notes. Do not give in and stand your ground! Souviners are very samey, when you see them in one shop, you will see them again, again and again. Keyrings and magnets cost average of 10 dirhams. Bracelets 5 dirhams. Postcards you can buy good quality for 2 dirhams. Try not pay any more than this. Overall fantastic experience!"

During the day. No beggars. Fantastic live snake charmers, henna artists ( 5 dhms) great customer service! Though the food stalls aren't open during the day, you should head to a rooftop restaurant grab a mint tea and watch the sun set and Jemaa Al Fnaa come alive! Always start at less than half the asking price, be confident, shake hands, and walk away if they don't agree to your price! They will whistle to you as you walk and agree on your first price! I'm not into fakes or replicas but you can nab lots of fake swag here! At the front of the market they will lure you and say everything is cheaper than Asda or Primark! It's not I can assure you! Some things are relatively cheap like t shirts (150-300 dhms) for designer replicas. Try looking further back into the souks as you will get better prices! Pay for quality items such as leather and gem stones but don't pay more than 5 dhms for souvenirs like key rings and coin purses! The soul is best for its craft and artisan pieces so make sure you nab some cultural pieces! Be careful of bringing ceramics back unless u have bubble wrap as the airport staff throw bags about a bit.. And if you want to avoid tears like me...

A must see when visiting this area of Morrocco. Have your wits about you, your purse held tight and enjoy the craziness that is Jemaa el-Fnaa. If you want to eat be careful of the street food,we watched it being set up early on and left in the heat for hours. The streetfood sellers are entertainment in themselves, impersonating Jamie Oliver and throwing us some great catchphrases to draw us in. The square changes from day to night, and as dusk falls the music players and dancers, the story tellers and snake charmers, the tooth pullers and henna tattooists make for a fascinating spectacle. Be warned, you need to be firm. Only show interest if you are happy to pay for the view. And use the phrase non merci as often as you need!!"

People will try to get you to shop/eat with them and some may even try to steer you in to their places but don't be put off. A firm no (possibly repeated) and they generally back off. There are always police patrolling the area also which makes for a safer feel if you're worried about crime.Also be aware of the entertainers who will try to get you to pay for services you didn't actually ask for for example pictures with monkeys/snakes so it's best to take pictures from afar and/or stay a bit further back from them when walking past.Over all a crazy experience not to be missed!"

I was a bit too nervous to venture right into the midst of the souks on my own for fear of getting lost so I just went around where I knew and bought some fantastic items. I didn't get hassled as I thought I might. I was approached but a simple, polite \"la Shukran\" and people let me get on my way. When I'd had enough I stopped for some mint tea in a cafe with a terrace and watched the world go by until it was time for my return shuttle bus.I also went on a guided trip on a caleche via Thomson at night.

During the night plenty of food some of which is rank. They did have some events on whilst we visited but not very Islamic and considering the noise reaches the Koutubia Masjid it does put you off a little. Having said that it's a nice place to walk or just relax if you can find a nice restaurant charging you surplus amounts due to location. There are some non harassing shops leading up to the main open area with some good restaurants to choose from that are better priced and have better food. As always you do have to watch out for pick pockets and chancers as well as mixed cultures from marrakech (new to old). Other than that people there's not much to see so best to move along to the souk."

Some of this could upset you and I have to agree I didn;t like seeing how the monkey's were treated and wouldn;t give any money to something like this. We went on a food tour while in the old town and the man doing the tour told us that one of the snake charmers had died recently when his snake bit him!! Be careful of some of the food stalls and juice stalls and do your research well. I gave mineral water back at one place as the cap wasn't sealed (I've heard they do this a lot). We ate at one of the friend fish stalls that had good reviews and apart from the dodgy mineral water the food was good.You'll get a lot of hassle from people in the square so keep walking and don't let it offend you."

Stand your ground and be firm if you do not want a henna tattoo, a firm \"la shukran\" (no thank you) usually does the trick. Please try the freshly squeezed orange juice, so delicious!!!

However be careful of eating food or fresh juices as they are not covered and are mostly out in the dreaded heat on the stalls I have personally seen loads of flies bees around the food which is disgusting as they don't cover , If you are looking to go into the small market shops be very careful in getting ripped off as they charge triple prices for tourists . So make sure you a calculater to convert and check how much they are charging you always give them a low price an be prepared to haggle they can end up following you if you walk out of shops given into your price so that is normal . There is loads of scarf and kaftan stalls . You will find spicies and loads of lamps . Taxis do over charge too so make sure you ask hotel for prices to and from there so you know . There are loads of henna stalls very fun to get they have pictures of designs for you to choose however again check you are not allergic to the black dye that is used is black henna ."

Dress modestly Sexual harassment is a big thing in Morocco. Local women and girls suffer from it on a daily basis. It's alright to wear shorts and tops, but make sure that they aren't too revealing. Their stares will literally \"disgust\" you. So, protect yourself and pride. If you're a tourist, they will still look...but there is a difference between a glance and a stare.2. Don't be afraid to say \"no\"In Marrakech's old medina, people can become pushy , when it comes to selling handmade goods. If it interests you, stay for a few minutes. If you don't, just walk away. You don't have to justify yourself with a \"no, thanks\"3. Crowded places Keep your bag close to you. Take picture, but be aware if someone is getting too close.4. If you take pictures of local people, ask if it's okay.Taking pictures with a monkey on your shoulder is very popular, but don't forget that those people will ask for money. If you don't pay them, they might get loud and aggressive. Marrakech is a beautiful city. I hope that my tips will help you adapt this new exotic world."

Watch out for the guys with the snakes, they take a photo with your phone then want a load of money for it, trying to rip you off! Luckily my gf speaks Arabic so that seemed to help us not get mugged off, just be careful.Felt really safe here, we got lost one night walking round the back streets at around midnight but didn't feel worried or intimidated at all."

You see tons of shops and restaurants lined around the square with peddlers heckling you every step of the day. The snakes and viper charmers were interesting but it's more about making a quick buck than providing a traditional experience. The night market is interesting. It's definitely a must see as it's a symbol of Morocco. I really wanted to love this place, but sadly, did not."

Anyway visited one of the food stalls and had a quick bite to eat. Paid 100 dhms for a few skewers of meat and a handful of sausages. Although they were tasty not worth the money. Be aware of thieves though. One of our party had some money stolen from a zipped up bag. The kids holding your hands are the distraction it seems so shoo them away."

They call you, praise you and the country you come from and the next thing you know she's doing a henna design on your hand. Shocking price comes later. When shopping remember to bargain for better prices. It's amazing how much the price drops once you start walking away. Marrakech was an amazing experience.

Atlas\u2019 highest peakWhich many are trying to conquer as we speak!Despite of these variations, this place makes me feel at homeMay be because it\u2019s like the country where I have grown.The inhabitants being Arabs, Berbers, Africans and EuropeansAll of whom are ruled by the KingCasablanca, Rabat and Fes are it's most important citiesBut Marrakech, a place very close to my heartIs the one about which I would like to, today, singMarrakech, the Land of Gods, with city walls all in pinkReminds of the glory of the bygone era and surely makes you think.Standing near Koutoubia Mosque, the inspiration behind Giralda tower in Seville, SpainThe guide explains us about the once misaligned mihrab, the pink stone minarets wallsThe floral motifs and the folklore, all cut short by the muezzin\u2019s afternoon calls.Koutoubia MosqueOn hearing the call for adhan, like others, I too take-off my shoes to step into the mosque,To be told non-Muslims not allowed by law, even when there is only one God.This statement certainly makes some noises in my headBut not to question the State law, I slowly drift away and start walking ahead.After walking for a little while I reached a crossroad crowded with vehicles, To one side, drove a young couple in high speed in their black Mercedes newAnd to the other, an old pair leisurely in their royal horse carriage drew.While both paused for the traffic light, I crossed the street followed by the parking lot of horse drawn carriage fleetJamaa-el-Fna, Marrakech\u2019s soul is the square where now I reach.It\u2019s one in the afternoon, the place jam packedWith orange juice stalls, snake charmers, magicians,Water sellers in traditional red costumes with brass cups and leather water-bagsCharging anything between five to ten dirham for their single photographLarge green garden umbrellas dotted the squareBelow which sat men wearing djellaba selling everything from fresh fruits to clothes to platesWhile beautiful women in colorful kaftans and belghas, waited with henna cones to decorate.Beside them sat an old palm reader, with his hair as white as snowHolding loosely Misbaha (string of prayer beads), in his wrinkled handsAnd waiting eagerly to reveal the fate of your entire clanHe tells me, \u201cYou are one of those lucky few, who follow the heart,And I can assure that you\u2019ll fall in love with this place before you part\u201d.In order to get a panoramic view of this majestic square, I climb up the stairsPulled out a corner chair at Caf\u00e9 de France, overlooking this giant fairAnd quietly listened the concoction of Chaabi and Gnawa musicAnd felt the happiness that filled the air.Deep down inside I wished, if somebody could translate and explain me the verseBut then they say, music is the universal language of love that touches the soul and need no words.The more I looked at this place, the more mesmerized I became.While I was still lost in my thoughts,A man in his thirties walked up to me and exclaimed, \u201cYou seem to be new,Why don\u2019t you come and join us for a bowl of stew\u201d.They narrated folklores of both hills and plainsAbout which I\u2019ll surely write sometime later, cause there is too much to explain.With the sun turning dark red and the night slowly crawling out,The square became even more crowded, noisier and merrier now With the food stall owners calling out\u201cCome try and taste our famous beef, mutton, rabit and chicken breastIf you don\u2019t like them at all, we\u2019ll serve you some fresh camel\u2019s chest\u201d.My newly found friends treated me with Couscous, Pastilla and TajineEach of which had some seven different kind of meats.Here in a country that\u2019s thousands of miles away from homeTheir warmth and hospitality, makes me feel that I am a part of their own.Once strangers, now friendsWarn me not to walk in this crowded square alone\u201cCoz in the shadows, you don\u2019t know who\u2019s your own.In these hours of darkness you\u2019ll lose your wayAnd in the end blame us that we didn\u2019t say\u201d.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll do as you say\u201d Only condition being, \u201cyou all will, with me, some more time stay\u201d.I wandered there throughout the night with my recently found friendsAdmiring the magnificence of hundreds of beautifully lit stalls,Enjoying the musician\u2019s tunes and the seller\u2019s callsAnd even this rainbow of chaos,Managed to touch my heart\u2019s right cords.And with the muezzins final call of the day sounding across all Marrakech in unisonThe noisy square for the first time became composed,And with a heavy heart, we too called it a day.Though I part today, Memories of Marrakech, the soul of Morocco, would in my heart always stay.And finally, the swarm started leaving the hiveWith a promise to assemble again tomorrow, with some more nectar for the soul!

They are put on tourists shoulders to have pictures taken for a few dirhams. The snake charmers goad the snakes out of boxes and baskets, harassing them with flapping material and sticks. The snakes appear listless and to have given up. The kaleshe horses are supposed to be inspected but I saw many lame and very thin animals, many with sores on their legs and bodies. I woke up at 5am to see the same horses still harnessed to their carriages stood in lines at the edge of the square. Some of the donkeys that are used to cart stuff round the city were also very thin, covered in sores and more often than not overloaded.Very depressing and ruins the square in my opinion. "

First of all, if your hotel is closeby, even a km away, comsider walking down Mohammed avenue, wide pavements and lots of families take this straight road to the fenaa. If you take taxi, don't let him persuade you that you can shop elsewhere better, its not that much of a problem, you can walk the back streets to the fenaa, its just its incredibly busy, hot and tourists stand out. At the fenaa, first of all make sure you get the ladies get hena done for no more than 10dh, find one which uses dark colours as they are beautiful and stay for longer. Note that all performances here are for money, so if someone dances in front of you, they're going to ask for money later. Avoid the snake and monkey charmers as they are aggressive and I personally don't like animals used for entertainment. There are amazing markets and food stalls, haggle as much as possible. Don't give any if the foods to young kids, the risk is to great. Try to stay till maghrib (sunset) when the lights are switched on. After sunset pop over to Koutoubia mosque and take your shoes off and walk inside and into the courtyard. Ask your hotel staff about mosque ettiquette, which should be fairly simple. After all is done, haggle and take a horse carriage ride either for a city tour or back to your hotel. Start asking from the back of the queue where prices are lower. This will give a lasting impression to kids, mine loved it!"

Make it through to the other side and stop in a cafe, get a coke/coffee/mint tea and take a breath.Then... You've got to go back into the square, steer clear of the monkeys and snakes unless you want to pay to see/photograph them. Get a fresh orange juice for 4dhr (prices are listed), make a mental note of everything you see for sale with a price, then enjoy yourself haggling with other vendors.All if the family enjoyed the haggle and vendors played along, we normally got a 300/400% discount on most things within 50-100 feet from the main square and 200/250% further out.Regardless of what you pay, ask yourself am I happy paying this price for this item? If it's a no, walk away, most of the time the vendors will try to find out your walk away price and if they can, they will offer it to you.Smile and enjoy the experience."

Vendors are aggressive but stand your ground and know what you're looking for. They are there to take advantage of tourists who don't know what they want. One night all the electricity went off, and many stands pulled out flashlights and kept working, and customers/tourists were all fairly calm, until the lights came back on five or so minutes later.

Only a few stalls selling fresh orange juice (which is beautiful and delicious but make sure you get your change!) and some sad monkeys with chains round their necks and snake charmers. Bt at night it's insane! Keep your wallets in your hand as it's classic place for mugging, that being said the atmosphere is amazing. You have to have your wits about you and learn to say no to the end lessen wanting you to sit down and eat at their market stall. I saw acrobats, snake charmers, lots and lots of musicians and what seemed like magicians or Street entertainers of some sort. Defiantly go in the evening but embrace the mayhem!"

After dark it is organized chaos, and if you do not like crowds, stay well away. It is worth visiting for the experience, but personally I found dressed up monkeys, de-fanged cobras and tortoises flipped on their backs onto the roasting hot ground too much and disturbing. Yes, I know it has been this way for centuries and will do so for many to come, but it is not for me.All I can recommend is to walk around for the smells, sights and sounds, and then head to once of many restaurants with a terrace to sit and watch from high above the milling crowds. However, if you want something alcoholic to drink, licensed places are rare, but the orange juices both on the terraces and in the square itself are to die for.A warning; be very careful of pick pockets, and the beggars are very demanding, more so than in Tangiers, but I guess if that is what you survive on, you have to be. Marrakech as the gateway to the Atlas was great, but personally I prefer Essaouira in every way."

But as soon as you get less nervous and less stressed when you realise that just saying no and ignore them works well to get rid of them, this place and the souqs are just over beyond! It's so different and you should just take yourself a few hours from 18:00 to 22:00 maybe to try all these funny things! And for the hennah We got ripped of and paid 200 drh for something that would have cost 30drh as a maximum as later our riad manager told us!

It was unbearable hot when the sun is up, so your best bet is to chill in the hostel or find some other activities and wait for the sun to set. At night, we felt like a whole Morocco is having a rendez-vous here at this famous square. The medina is a maze, a real one, though, we didn't get lost, thanks to some kid walked us out of there and somehow we ditched him. My experience in Marrakech wasn't very nice. The day I arrived in Marrakech was also the first day I arrived in Morocco, was also a first day I was in Africa. I took the taxi from the airport to the hostel which cost 200 dirham, which I shouldn't have done it. It would be so much cheaper if you take bus 19 from the airport and it will drop you off at the square for 30 dirham. How convenient. It was my first time, I didn't know better, but next time, when I come back, that's what I would do. Outside the airport, walk to your left and across the street, you will see the bus stop and get on bus 19. When the taxi dropped me off at my hostel, I was threw off by a guy walking me over to the hostel from the taxi for about 2 steps and asking for money. I didn't give him any, but I had a bad impression about this city. I learned that if you need help or want to ask for direction, go into store and ask the store owner, they will be glad to help you. Don't rely on the kids or people in the street, they will always ask for something in return after they help you. But we also got some free help along the way, so it is really your luck and play it smart. I was nervous, but I was fortunate enough to meet 2 girls at the hostel who were kind enough to take me around the medina for dinner ( I wasn't even feeling hungry, but I know I need to eat). My first meal in Morocco was lamp head dish. I am going to leave my comment out for this one. We walked around, drinking juice, watching shows until late at night. It is totally safe to be a girl and to be out that late in Marrakech. So stop worrying yourself sick from whatever you read on the internet about Morocco. The entire time, we were in Morocco, we felt safe and not once we felt threatened, though, you felt annoyed by Moroccan men and store owners from cat calling you, name calling you, and constantly inviting you to their shops. Only on one incident, there were some touching, but I stood my ground and yelled at them, they backed up. Also, the local women stepped in to help us and protect us. So you just need to be tough, and things will work out for you. The local women are very protective of you. We met so many solo female travelers. And also, it is not necessary to carry toilet paper around in Morocco, because everywhere we went, cafe, hostel, museum, studio, there are toilet paper. Another time I was in Marrakech, I got sick the last day I flew out of Marrakech. It could be the bad food we had the night before, since I decided to stuff myself with Moroccan food on my last day before going home. Not a smart decision. Also, there was no air conditioner at the hostel we stayed at, so I was sleeping in my sweat and it turned into a cold the next day. Try to buy water at convenience store, if you pay more than 6 dirham, you overpay. When going to the airport, I was going to take the taxi but the guy at the hostel advised me to take the bus. Going from the square to the airport, just go to the bus stop where you see the tallest mosque, get on bus 19 to go to the airport for 30 dirham."

He said there is no refrigeration (confirmed), and unsanitary handling of food (confirmed). Now I know that this is a really unique experience and while no one in our group became ill, the whole notion makes one a little queasy. Especially, when untouched skewers found their way back onto the grill and were served to other patrons. This made me ponder the origins of our food.

You could buy stuffed pizza like things fr 10ds absolutely scrumptious and filling. Ice creams were a treat, crepes, food everywhere, carts outside, snake charmers, henna stalls, and what not. The true culture of Morocco could be experienced here, and don't be offended if people as you for money, just politely say no to them if you don't want to spare change.

During the month of July, the action only begins in the evening, and is like a carnival ever night of the week until about 1am.There is a lot to take in here; the juice salesmen, the outside traditional BBQ stands, the music, the smoke, the performers, the beggers, all of the people, the salesmen. Its a lot to take in, and it can be hard to let your guard down, but you can.The Bad:-Everyone is trying to make some money, you are approached by a lot of people if you walk through the square; selling anything from morrocan hash to cigarettes to napkins or toys. Some of these people are legit businessmen and some are just beggars. It can all get a bit much, but it is a great experience.-The performers are very nice at first but then turn very sour, rude and even offensive. On one occasion a man was very jolly, he put his hat on my head as I was trying to walk away from him and I couldn't give him anymore signs that I did not want anything to do with him or a photo. Then the jolliness soon turned into an evil look and a smarmy Arabic comment underneath his breath as he walked away with no dirham from me.-The vendors can be to much sometimes, you could be approached 10 times in just 1 minute in a busy section of the square. You soon learn how to be nice but very clear about your standing.-The beggars, you can't help everyone.- The souks close to the square are aimed at silly tourists and are ridiculously over priced.The Good-It is a spectacle everyone should see.-Some of the vendors are very nice and do not turn sour if you do not pick their BBQ to eat at. -It is like stepping back in time"

Acrobats were amazing and well worth a modest tip. Restaurants were ok, there's better dining away from the main square, but you should go at least once during the day to watch the endless activity. Most don't sell alcohol here.Night time, dining at the stalls is huge fun, good food, didn't feel ripped off at all, and sat alongside a Moroccan family who were really friendly.If you sit near the front, you'll have to go through the no thanks routines all over again with the cake etc sellers. Not a big deal. Fresh orange juice stalls afterwards are not to be missed. Go and enjoy."

We had a snack and mint tea on the balcony of cafe de France. Perfect spot to see everything and to take photos without being asked for money. Behind all of the relentless money making we discovered that the Moroccans are very warm and generous. Despite getting there early It was 46\u00b0, our daughter almost fainted outside one cafe and the locals couldn't do enough to help her.Tips: a polite no merci stops most of the attention.

In the daytime I could see much more. The large square is surrounded by touristy shops all trying to sell souvenirs, leather goods, traditional clothes and lights, creams and potions etc. There are many shops selling the same things. You can see snake charmers, barbary apes, traditional water sellers, all trying to get you to pose and have a photo taken for a few dirhams. Ladies try and sell you a henna design and children try and sell small packets of tissues. Acrobats tumble in front of the cafes and pass round a hat afterwards. It is a different world, the noise of the snake charmers flutes and the constant drumming add to the atmosphere. The atmosphere is what I like best about the Square, the pressure to come and look in the shops, to eat at one of the food stalls or to have a henna tattoo are the things I like least. I declined to go near the snakes, but the man was persistent. I absolutely hate snakes. I declined to have a henna tattoo and the lady said, it is a present. Of course she went on and on up my arm and then demanded a huge sum for her 'present'. The traders are there to earn a living of course, but if you don't want something you have to be firm or they will take advantage of any perceived weakening. If you take a camera ask if you want to photograph an individual, and be aware that the regulars will expect money. Pickpockets and thieves are expert at relieving you of your property so carry your backpack in front of you and keep your hands over the fastenings, especially in crowds. Because it is a tourist area the cafes charge more for beverages and food, but look for the cafes that the locals use. They are cheaper. Even so, the food is very good value. There is an open air food hall with countless food tables at night and I can recommend Stall 14 for fish, calamari and shellfish. It is unlike anything I have seen before."

There is nothing you can't find from tarot card reader to snakes charmers and henna tattoos however you need to be very careful so if the market traders can be pushy. The square get transformed at night it becomes very lively with live traditional music, dances food and market traders I will say the real hustle and bustle of Marrakech. It is a wonderful experience and I will recommend everyone to visit the square at least once at night. Be careful of the traders they will try to push you to buy things and always agree on a price before as they tend to change their price. There are a lot of small shops with fixed marked price I will advise you to buy from them. Morocco is well known for their Argan oil and every trader will advise you to buy from them but please double with a guide or your Riad that they are proper Argan oil. Enjoy the city it is very safe, I was travelling alone and didn't face any issues"

The henna artists in the square are everywhere and I'm pretty sure sanitary measures lack.

And then, suddennly, you are in the middle of an almost medieval show: musicians, dancers, fortune tellers, trained monkeys, \"traditional\" travesti dancers, snakes charmers, the smell of spices, of fresh squized oranges, etc, etc. If you like you can mix up with and let yourself go with the crowd, but a good idea is also to see all this show from a restaurant or bar balcony. From time to time you hear muslim prayers from the mosques nearby, you can catch a tuk-tuk or a caleche or you can adventure yourself throug the souks. And the funny thing is that a century ago the square shouldn't be much different from today. Don't miss it! Just magic!"

I would pay if they were dancing or performing but they weren't. The man got right in my face & swore at me. My friend felt very intimidated. I would suggest going in a group for safety and if you go shopping in the souks round the edges of the square go up & come back down each alley because if you turn off you'll be lost forever!!

That said, the people were friendly and we loved the sounds of the call to prayer; the music; the chatter and the ambience. The smells were heavenly with a mixture of exotic spices; incense and foods. We felt it was important to dress respectfully and wore a scarf to cover bare arms and a low top. The souks were a sight to behold. Came away feeling truly humbled and with a great respect to the friendly people of Marrakech. No words can truly describe this place. A must for all visitors!"

There were not as many street performers as we had hoped, which was one downfall.Another was the constant badgering for money from the performers, and the beggars. A word of advice about taking pictures. Make sure you have settled on the amount up front and then stick with it. We ran into a situation with one of the snake charmers, we settled on amount to take a picture that included me with the snakes, and then he wanted more. We offered and paid 50 dirhams, which was a fair price, we thought, but he insisted he wanted more. We finally walked away.Also, unless you want to pay, do not stand too close to the monkeys. They have apparently been trained to jump on people, and once they do, their handlers immediately want paid, whether you wanted the monkey on you or not.Also, if you decide to walk through the souks to get there, make sure you know your way. There are signs along the way, but we are not sure they take you the quickest way. And if you ask for directions, make sure you ask for Jemma el Fna, not the square. The square is apparently another spot.Overall though, it was a wonderfully exotic place, the people were generally friendly, and it is ringed with cafes that provide excellent food and some of them provide terraces where one can watch the chaos from above."

We were even recommended certain food stalls to try, specifically 14 for the seafood and fried calamari. However, after about 2 minutes walking through the square, we were accosted by a performer with a monkey. When my husband refused to want to take a picture with a monkey, it was placed on him against his will and then asked to pay for the handling. After a confrontation about payment, I was grabbed by one of the henna ladies and after saying that I wasn't interested in henna, she grabbed my hand to start the design. I literally had to pull my hand away and shout no! On our walk back through the square to go back to our hotel, again, we were a accosted by a snake charmer and asked to pay even though we were literally walking by. I am okay paying performers when watching or partaking in a performance or service is something that I am seeking out but this was ridiculous! We have traveled a lot and this was the first place where I felt very uncomfortable and it was more of a Hassle than enjoyable. There were some great performers out that did not use this tactic (the musicians) and they were entertaining to watch so if you can bear the crowds and the harassment by performers that aren't drawing the crowds, then give it a go!Another option is to go on top of one of the roof terraces overlooking the square and grab a drink! You get great Ariel views of all the people below without the hassle and hustle. As for the foods stalls, 14 is hit or miss to when it is open. It wasn't open for the 2 nights we tried going to I can't review it personally, but we had multiple travelers as well as locals tell us to try it!"

With families, women, children out, we were basically left alone. Be aware of your surroundings and firm around the sellers, snake charmers, etc. Also, it goes without saying that quiet, dark alleys can be intimidating.

It's called the big square and the name is suiting, it's a very big square.

Be prepared to be hassled, the people are ruthless. One man followed us for a long time then started yelling expletives at us since we wouldn't give him money.

You do get hassle from people wanting to sell you stuff especially if you stop and look at something but this is all part of the culture and adds to the atmosphere of the place. Just remember that you do not have to buy and remember to haggle hard if you want to buy something.Generally if you say you are just looking they don't try too hard. I have found that the best way to get money off is to tell them that you don't want it and walk away - the price soon comes down. When haggling you need to have an idea of what you would be happy paying and if they are happy with it they will agree - if you are not happy keep walking. If you want to buy an item, stop and ask the price and then walk away, look for it somewhere else, ask the price and walk on. Doing this I was quoted 120dhr, 90dhr 80dhr and 60dhr all for the same product which I finally agreed to pay 40 for! (Although I did give them 50 in the end as I didn't have exact change and I thought 50 was reasonable and we'd had a bit of banter!!)Remember that they want to make a sale so just tell them you have found it cheaper elsewhere and stick to your guns. If they don't want to sell it for that price they won't, they just want to make as much profit as possible and you can't blame them for that. When you find that you are arguing over less than a \u00a31 you have to think is it worth it - it may be time to concede that 10 or 20dhr!People will come up to you in the square trying to get you to have your photo taken with a snake or a monkey or to have a henna tattoo. If you don't want it say no and keep walking, don't engage in conversation. Say no in Arabic, la shukraan, or I don't like it, mahaj'baneesh but most of all just smile and keep walking.The cafe's around the square are expensive and charge 'tourist prices' it is better to go off the square a little way where things will be much cheaper. If you stand in the square looking towards the nearest, biggest mosque there is a good selection of caf\u00e9s such as Nzaha Snack Restaurant to your left. Here the food is really good and a fraction of the price of places a few hundred yards away. Chicken tagine is 30 dhr compared to 60, a soft drink is 8 and not 12. I had a really nice vegetable omelette for 12dhr and the bread and sauce was free whereas some other places charge for it. The food her is really good and the restaurant is popular with the locals.The square really comes alive at night and is well worth experiencing. Food stalls are set up in the square at dusk we usually go to No 1 Ayeesha, apparently she is the only female chef in the square and stands command over her army of men! Most of the stalls sell the same sorts of foods, just chose one you like and sit down. Generally you don't get hassle when you are at one of the stalls so it's a great place to watch the madness that is the square. If you really don't want to engage with anyone or be asked to buy pastries or tissues, or African paintings or carvings, then sit in the middle of a stall and away from the thoroughfares.I have found the Moroccan people to be lovely, very warm and welcoming and have made some very good friends here. The people like to stop and chat and ask where you are from. If you remember you are in control and you don't have to buy anything unless you want to you it will be ok! It's fun just enjoy the experience!"

The souks are great places for shopping and always barter. If you are staying in a hotel look at the hotel shop prices to give you an idea of what not to pay. If you are thirsty or need food there are plenty of places to eat and drink, but very few which are licensed. We ate in the Le Marrakchi, which is on the square and has great views and is licensed to sell alcohol ( See my review under the Restaurant name). There is also another place where we only had drinks and did not eat which is called Le Salama which is licensed and you can eat or pop I.

However, we were very irritated by the constant harassment and unwanted solicitation by the vendors and beggars. Often the same vendor would solicit you more than once and sometimes they would not leave you alone. Everyone who offers to help has an angle and wants money. My children were very uncomfortable with this and I worry they got the wrong impression of Marrakech in general.  To mitigate this experience I suggest going to the square during the day first, don't take a lot of extra stuff (purses, bags, etc), and do not be timid. Marrakech protects its tourists and it's undercover police step in quickly to remove overbearing vendors. In short, the square is safe but you may feel harassed."

Also, unlike in the West, no drunk people walking about, which makes it feel a little bit safer. And the shops are closed late in the evening, so no people aggressively trying to sell you stuff!In the day, this is a great place for freshly squeezed juice. Freshly squeezed orange juice costs just 4Dh (the equivalent of about 35p in British currency).If you're a woman, beware of the henna ladies, especially the burkha-clad ones.

Seeing people follow us and beg for money and repeat things over and over was initially frustrating until the penny dropped. We walked past dozens of people sleeping under bed sheets, children from the ages of 5 to old men in their 60s desperate for a few pounds. It really was heartbreaking and I fail to see how anyone with a deepened level of conscious empathy could possibly enjoy such an experience. Sure the food and spices smelled amazing and there was a buzz to the square, but we are now sitting in our Riad wondering how a country so beautiful and rich could leave the people in such poverty. Families melting frozen water to drink, going through rubbish bags for food. Monkeys in chains and boxes being used for tourist photos, ferrel cats everywhere. It's heartbreaking and if you really enjoy yourselves there I think you need to get more in tune with reality. Praying for those in Medina struggling.

Some of the terraced bars are equipped with an outdoor a/c solution which makes you feel like a plant being constantly watered. Really nice. The place starts to buzz when the sun goes down and it becomes bearable not to have to be in shade. Now your choice of eateries trebles all with good natured touts.

This is to allow for a cautious observation on your first visit. See the Mad antics of the snake Charmers and monkey trainers. Watch them argue with tourists and fight amongst each other. Even the over supply of orange juice sellers get passionate for your business at around $0.50 a cup. The persuasive staff at the pop-up BBQ eateries will make you feel obliged to a eat at every single one of them. Check out some of the side stallswhere you can get a deep fried sardine in a bun, check out the flamboyant henna tattoo artist who will smoothly charge you $24 for a tattoo you you can get for $3 in Southeast Asia. If you don't want a monkey or snake on your shoulders don't shake hands with their handlers. They will put them on within 2 seconds. On your first day, spending some time on a roof Terrace observing the spectacle is recommended, even for the photos. But make sure you go down and get amongst it. As with anywhere in Morocco you have to be quite Savvy with your bargaining skills, firm but reasonable. Don't be led astray and don't lead them astray. Quite often I have noticed the vendors having heated arguments with each other. I would love to know what it is about you sometimes. Some of the Stand-alone acrobatics are quiet world class and all they do is ask for small change from The Observers. Get there before Sundown to watch the setting up as well as good photo opportunities of the Koutoubia mosque minaret. Keep your wits about you and by the third visit you may even feel at one with this mad place. Nothing will fully prepared for 'the square' so go there and have your own experience."

Some wont even let you take photos of their colourful stalls if you are hust browsing and making your mind up about to eat. There are many touts. In short, over the last twenty years, Jemaa el Fna has become uglier ... a congested tourist trap. You probably should experience it once, but the second time it wont be so pleasant anymore. Just like Egypt where the tourist are simply looked upon as dollars ready to be milked. And woe befall you if you innocently point your cameras at any locals.

At night the square is buzzing, it's a really good atmosphere, again you can get pestered and feel harassed but you soon learn to either ignore it or be firm with them, remembering they are only trying to earn a living. I'd probably steer clear from any stool or stand selling food and drink.The views are fantastic, you're surrounded by mosques and the call to prayer is a lovely haunting sound of that you can hear from the main square clearly. If you're in Marrakech you have to go here. I would say to dress appropriately, the streets can often be very wet and dirty."

Make sure you sit on the outside! Its crazy busy and they spill food and even hot tea on you lol. Its always busy!#115 was really good as well - calamari here#5 You MUST get your mint tea here! Its 5dh and the best I had in Mk. The guys are super nice and the glasses are big. Snails - they're snail booths on the edge were really good too. Not as good as Paris snails but pretty dang good & noteworthy. *Dont forget at the food stalls you get charged for everything the put down in front of you (except the bread). Just waive it away if you don't want it. I love food stalls, we always eat street food on vacation, its the best. Don't be afraid, just take some pepto or Imodium just in case.  * If you see a lady making \"tortillas\" with what I think was bright orange cheese, on the sides of the ally - GET ONE. They're a green opinion flatbread amazingness roll. Actually one of our favorite things we've had anywhere and we would get one every morning and every night on the way to and from our Riad! Date rolls too from pretty much anywhere and lots of orange Juice of course! Some random guy selling coconut, pineapple and fruit - was delicious. I heard some will water it down but I didn't worry about it and it was all very tasty. In fact I bought an orange juicer when we got back lol. We were on the hunt for a non wool rug - I LOVE the boucherouite style and its so expensive online. We cant have wool - we live in the tropics and it molds. I found an amazing boucherouite 6x8 at the stand near the spice square for $120! It would easily be a $600 rug online. His card says \"Carpet Souk Marrakech Rahba Kdima near Cafe des espices - 93 Carpet Auction\". He was really nice, NOT pushy at all whatsoever and a straight shooter. He didn't haggle that much but we settled on the price pretty quick. Also some GREAT deals on wedding blankets down the ally directly behind his booth. In the $50-$60 range! I just didn't have anymore room and sadly the little metal disks would just rust here. All in all we haggled, but we found the prices to be fair. We did walk away a few times to be chased down but mostly I knew what I would pay and stayed firm. I got taken on one item, a big silver fish that we way overpaid for but I feel the rest was great. Don't buy into the hype, locals were SOO friendly, it was a blast and you can tell their tourism board makes sure tourists have a great time. I know I was curious on prices so I am adding a few of what we bough here:$5-7 Shoes - embroidered leather$10 Brass Camels and other animals$20 Large hand of fatima door knocker 9+inches tall - brass $2 each - little custom made teaspoons (really cute - hand hammered)$25 Sterling Silver Berber hand stamped bracelet (I LOVE this!) Make sure you tell them \"pure silver\" or you'll get the cheaper stuff. $5 each - cool embroidered loomed cotton towels$5 each for funny hats with colorful fluff balls$8 small teapot $40 two medium sized vintage wedding blanket pillows$2 each - moroccan tea glasses with metal sleeves - there are cheaper ones, these are handmade$15 round gold colored metal hand stamped plate - was amazing to watch him make these. At the entrance to the medina by the spring, as you go in you go through the narrow entrance - that booth, he makes the plates and will demo for you. I bought $50 in stuff from him, he also let me take a photo of him working which is pretty hard to get. Its true they REALLY hate photos. *SHIPPING:We didn't ship back the rug, they wrapped it up nice and tight for us and I managed to fit it into our suitcase 6ftx8ft! We spent two weeks in Portugal (cold) so we did ship back all of our cold weather clothes and kept a few outfits that would mix and match. The post office was easy to find - its close to the main entrance where the horses line up. They don't take CCs and our clothes were a whopping $120. Ouch. No one there speaks english, I bet I could have shipped a different method that was cheaper - I guess mine was just morocco post - and gotten better deal but I just wanted room for souvenirs. Box arrived a week after we got home. I wouldn't ship too many souvenirs home, I was worried about them getting lost or damaged - the box of our clothes was BEAT up really bad."

The monkeys, snakes and henna tattoo artists are still there, but so are the food stalls. Set up everyday and taken down at the end of the evening. Boiled sheeps head, escarot by the tub you owe it to yourself to try it all. The square can be intimidating as the sellers are quite agressive, but if you have a good idea of what you want to eat make a note of the stall number. They seem reluctant to try and take business away from the competition so just say \"oh we are going to # ???\". The souks surrounding the square are quite good, but as expected the sellers are agressive. Price compare between one seller and the other. Keep it good-natured and you will be surprised at how much the price will be reduced by."

I didn't appreciate being charged for bread at stall 1 though as we did not request the bread and the other stalls offered it free of charge. All day there are juice stalls and a glass of orange cost just 4 dh. Away from the food stalls, there is other entertainment- small bands, snake charmers, dancing monkeys and gymnasts. The monkeys were sad to see but other tourists clearly consider it entertainment so it is income for their 'owners'.

We visited Jemaa el Fna Square one evening before going onto PepeNero restaurant, which is about a 5-10 minute walk away.It's a place like no other. Full of street vendors, market stalls, food stalls, street entertainers, monkeys dressed in clothes, snake charmers. Horses and carriages, restaurants, cafes. Busy, noisy, an assault on all the senses. A fabulous place!We didn't spend long there, but it's somewhere you could spend the whole evening shopping, eating, watching the entertainment. Another must when in Marrakesh. And it's easy to find as most places we visited in the Medina had signs for the square. That in itself means no excuses, as it's possibly the one place you can find without getting lost.One word of caution, as we found in the Medina, there are scams and shifty locals looking to rip-off tourists, so be aware of them. Keep your wits about you and if all else fails call the nearby tourist police! Though it's unlikely to come to that.We - perhaps naively - almost fell foul of a snake charmer. What started out as a funny and pleasant experience - the snake charmer chatted to us, put a little green snake around my neck (the snake was friendly, it was fine!), and took a photo of us in front of a big snake that he \"charmed\" to sit up in front of us. The photo was great and worth paying for. The problem was, how much to pay for it. The snake charmer demanded 200 Dirham (around \u00a314.00) and wouldn't accept any lower. He demanded 'paper money only' and rather than what we expected to be a good-humoured haggle to a reasonable price he insisted we paid him 200 Dirham. That is way over the top. A local told us an acceptable price would be around 50 Dirham. In the end we put our first offer of a 20 Dirham note in his hat and walked off, with him shouting after us. A snake charmer without the charm indeed! But again, as we later found out, a well-used tourist scam. Which was a shame as if we had entered into a good-natured haggle we would have paid more. Bear in mind a 30 minute taxi journey to the square costs 150 Dirham, so an un-charming man taking a couple of photos for 30 seconds is hardly worth 200 Dirham.But all part of the experience, and if you do not want to talk to snake charmers, henna ladies, the owners of dancing monkeys, just ignore them and keep your cool if they persist. They will soon move onto the next person...Overall Jemaa el Fna is a great place to visit and something for everyone, whether that is the tourist attractions, shopping, enjoying street food or sitting watching the world go by."

Dive in and eat or you'll be hassled to eat all the time. We wanted a picture of the snake charmers but I would strongly advise against it. They will try every trick in the book to get more money from you. Firstly they approach and try to get you to take the picture before agreeing a price. Don't fall for it. We agreed 15dihrams, but afterwards another character said I'd offended him by not giving him the money and demanded '100 more'. I refused and he squared up to me and got his well-rehearsed 'crazy eye' going. I gave him 15dms and walked off. He came chasing after me and said that I'd given him a coin that wasn't Moroccan (that he'd obviously) swapped. I kept walking away and he gave up. Keep well clear as this incident left a bad taste in our mouths."

At the risk of sounding like some boring old hippy from the 60's - it just isn't what it used to be.When we visited 11 years ago the square was probably an equal mix of locals and tourists mingling together. The souk stalls around the square were always over priced compared with further in but the stuff on sale was the same as everywhere. Now in the daytime the bad imitation kaftans are out numbered by the knock off football kits and dodgy looking watches. At night last time we found the locals sitting around socialising, watching acrobats and listening to storytellers and some genuinely crazy locals posing for photos (for DH of course what do you expect this is Morocco!) and the food stalls were set up each night and again, were a mix of locals and tourists sitting side by side alongside some serious health and safety hazards in the form of flaming bbq's and displays of everything from tame chicken skewers to obscure sheep innards and eyeballs. The prices were negotiable and affordable for locals and tourists alike and everyone mucked in together. Now the food stalls are on a fixed footing and set out like mini restaurants. There's nothing more challenging than sausages (not an eyeball or sheepshead in sight) and there isn't a local in sight apart from the seriously aggressive touts and the bored looking cooks - with not a flame in sight on the gas bbq's. We didn't bother staying for dinner. Clearly there's been an attempt to make the place safer and more user friendly for a european audience - but Disnification never improves a place. If you have to pay rent on a permanent stall I guess you have to get aggressive with marketing it - it made me really sad actually and I'd avoid the South Western end of the souk altogether now and go seek out the friendly moroccans who are to be found everywhere else but here."

Food stall is bigger and they have funny ways of attracting the customers. Probably cheaper food here but didn't try anything. If someone stops in front of these stalls to buy something, 'heena' ladies will certainly be around. Some of them are so desperate that they don't even bother to ask and after that one must pay according to their demand. There are also a number of street beggars in the square specially near the shopping carts. Snake charmers and street dancers along with watch sellers are very active here. One should have changes to take photos of them. I paid 10 MAD for one photo of a snake charmer with snakes.A safe place I would say but nothing to loose if one keeps an extra eye around. In all, one can certainly enjoy the evening here. Must see if one visits Marrakech."

I've haggled in Cairo, driven in Delhi and managed to not just survive Chandni Chowk - which has to be the busiest place on the planet and makes the Moroccan souks look positively spacious - but enjoy it. Jemma el Fna is picturesque enough - though there are a lot less stalls than I was expecting (it's Ramadan, which may explain it). The cafes around the edge provide a comfortable and stress-free place to take photos, and the prices aren't that bad (30 MAD for a juice cocktail, 15 for a tea). The food stalls, however, are another thing entirely. The menu prices bear little relation to what you're charged for - all the \"extras\" you think you're being given are going on your bill. We ordered a mixed skewers (60 MAD) and a chicken tagine (40), two cokes and a Fanta. We ended up with two portions of skewers for no particular reason, but somehow the bill was 450 - the olives, bread, vegetables and couscous (all of which was provided as standard to everyone who sat down) apparently making up the difference. After arguing (in Arabic) the guy knocked 50 off and then started to get hostile, so we left annoyed and disappointed - only to be hassled for a service charge as we stood up!It appears that the Koran's instruction to do business fairly doesn't apply to tourists in Morocco, even in Ramadan.

Everybody tries to get some Dirhams out of you and especially if you didn't pack your camera away, some of them will even follow you asking you to pay for photos you didn't take.Also the various groups only appear to perform for money, but as for dancing groups for example only very halfheartedly. I was also quite disappointed by the snake charmers. Would have been happy to give some Dirhams for a nice picture, but there was no effort, whatsoever, put into presentation and you constantly had to watch out, whether one of them wanted to put some snake around your shoulders and make you pay for it.Especially this last aspect keeps you nervously looking around all the time and at least getting us to leave the place rather quickly."

This was not everyone - just a couple of people and did not let this get us down. The constant haggling is VERY exhausting - but is definitely worth doing. In once case, we went into one shop and was told something was 900 Dhiram - he ended up selling it to us for 220 Dhiram. And it did not even take that long. This is annoying and can be deceiving for those that are not particularly clued up about this. I was trying to buy a tagine and found this one place which I didn't realise was actually 2 shops - they confused me so much as they kept contradicting what the other was saying - so ended up not buying one.

We have been a few times now so here are some tips:- if you take any photos of the water sellers, monkeys or snake charmers etc and they spot you, they will ask for money if you try and say you weren't taking a picture ture of them, they will ask to see the pic on camera.- if you have young kids (I have a 4yo ) be careful of the young men selling little lights, balls etc. They will put the toy into the child's hand and then ask for money.-the horse and carriage rides are great but haggle as they bump up the price ALOT for tourists.- The henna artists will grab your hand and start putting the henna on before you say anything sometimes so be aware.- As with any crowded place, pickpocketing can occur so keep belongings close.- The souks can seem intimidating but they are safe. If you think u are lost, look for signs or ask shopkeepers who sell food etc. The reason for this is there will be a lot of people especially young kids asking if they should show you the way to the square. But they will ask for money the end.- The food in the souks and square is amazing and safe: you can see seafood and meats being grilled in front of you or moroccan crepes being made inside the souks as well as sweet delicacies.- the alleys in the souks are narrow so do tread carefully. Also it is normal for scooters and bikes to use the alleys, sometimes cars! So do keep your wits about you; they all seem to be very aware of pedestrians and we have not witnessed anyone being knocked over. Yet.- The deeper in to the souks you go the better quality some of the stuff is and more reasonably priced. There are different sections such as the spice market or the clothes section or metalwork. - There are so many hidden gems in terms of restaurants so do look for them in the souks. They can be deceiving from the outside but once you go in they often open up in to courtyards and rooftop terraces - breathtaking and romantic. There are also lots of cheap eats.- At the end of the day it is a market pace so people will try to sell you things, some will be more persistent than others! Do not feel harassed or fed up just be polite but firm and keep walking. As my husband says 'look with your eyes not your hands': as soon as you touch something they will take out another 10 to show you!- There are lots of taxis around for taking people back to their hotels after shopping: however the rates go up after 9PM.Don't be put off by people approaching you, it is a tourist attraction and you are tourists, they are trying to make a living and a lot of the stuff is amazing.

If your going to eat on the Square, do your homework online about which stalls are the best. A bad choice could make a big difference. We ate at stall 32 and got the sausages and it was great. There are a lot of locals at that stall and we even went back the next night for the same thing."

During the day it is filled with traders, juice sellers, snake charmers and henna artists. At night the square explodes into a cacophony of drum beats and the noise of food stall owners touting for trade, smells of grilling of meats and boiling of snails from the ubiquitous food stalls, and all in a kaleidoscope of colour. Demand for tables is high and queuing isn't an option. Best to take a check on the menu, Moroccans tend to eat all of the lamb, bar the eyes. If you want to watch from above the Restaurant Argana and Cafe Glacier are good choices."

It is definitely worth a visit however it all gets a bit samey and boring after a while - everybody is trying to sell you anything or yelling at you to go to their stall. At night the food people at the market are quite aggressive at one point we had about 5 men around us with the exact same menu trying to get us into their \"stall\", when you just want food that can get very very annoying and you start to get angry. The shops are nice and I got few lovely things but be warned they do rip off tourists (a man tried to sell us a pair of shoes for 220dh when we knew it was worth 70dh) and a good tip to remember is that stuff is always a third of what they actually offer. The orange juice is a must and sitting in the balcony of a nice restaurant overlooking the market is really fun as well."

I'm trying to decline politely, and she is saying \"free sample, free sample\" and goes nuts with the henna.

Luckily, no leg henna, but when she finished, my husband gives her 20 dirhams, and NO! She wants 300 dirhams. I offered 20 for her \"free sample\" to be polite. The two women are screaming at me about they have given me a gift and now I must give a gift. And they are almost diving into my purse. I grabbed 200 dirhams--the first bill I could find, and threw it and ran. So, beware the henna ladies. You'll be covered in henna before you can say \"no.\" Other notes on the square, it is a little overwhelming, but most people are very, very nice. The Cafe Glacier opposite the French Cafe is nice and cool with good people watching. The best place was the Cafe des Epices. It's air conditioned, and the cinnamon coffee was amazing. The people watching was divine. My husband was so bad at haggling that the hat seller actually haggled himself down to about half price in sympathy.

You have to pay for photos of the drummers, dancers or the people with snakes. Sit in one of the roof-top restaurants for couscous and watch the action from above. It is not expensive, but no alcohol served. April was perfect temperature."

The views in the restaurants nearby were great and the food was cheap also. You can get tajine for anywhere from 30 to 60 DH which is 3-6 euros. Being that this is definitely the most touristy spot, that is a good price. Tons of musicians and performers. Snake charmers, street acrobats, Berber musicians, you can find it all. I loved the snail soup and it was only 10 DH!"

Watch out for the men holding monkeys (poorly treated in cages and on chains) as wanting photos only results in this horrible practice continuing. Also keep an eye out for the snake charmers who if shown any interest, might throw a snake around your neck - all for money of course. Final warning - the ladies with henna who can grab an arm and begin before you've even had the chance to decline. All that being said - it's a safe area, and as long as you're observant and say no thank you in French, English or Arabic you'll be fine and enjoy the spectacle that this place is!"

Anything above this is stupidity and daylight robbery. Don't fall for their sob stories.

Same with buskers - take their photo and they will demand money and swear at you if you ignore them.This area is definitely not typical of the people and places of Marrakech.

You need to be an assertive seasoned traveller to experience this culture at its finest, and don't get me started on the amazing Souks! Even better if you know some French. I'd highly recommend the Hotel/Riad Cecil- just take the city bus or petite cab (under $7 Cdn from the airport) to Jemma el Fna square and walk clockwise until you get to the rooftop restaurant. Keep going one or two streets to find the hotel. Tips: use an iPhone compass and landmarks so that you don't get lost in the Souks. It's too easy to do. If you do (which I did twice), just bribe a teenager to show you back the \"Jemma\" and then pay them what you think is fair, or offer them half of what they ask...To escape the city, take a public bus to Essouria on the coast- like paradise!"

And throngs of people show up to experience the craziness of it all. People walk around, avoiding the aggressive IPhone and watch vendors who will hound you mercilessly if you dare to make eye contact. Make sure to avoid stepping on a monkey's tail as you're running from the woman who wants to give you a temporary henna tattoo. And don't show too much interest in any one food stall before you make a decision, or else you may just cause a fight to break out. Luckily, as a Muslim country, most of these people are sober through all this. Because if they were drunk, I can't even begin to imagine how insane it would be. So come one down and give it a try.

On a personal note, everyone says that it is difficult to shake off people in Marrakesh once they decided to sell you something. My experience was otherwise.

If you do take a photo you will be expected to pay, that is how the entertainers are making their money, currently the excepted rate is 20dhs, however people will try and get more. If you tell them it's not your first time visiting they leave you be.If you have a photo with someone, be watchful that they do not have all their friends join in, they will all want paying individually. Keep you money in a small clutch bag in front of you, this is a busy square, there will be pickpockets."

They were walking slightly behind us and before we realised what had happened a monkey had been placed on one of them and then money requested for a photo. Moments later a lady had tightly grasped the girl's hand and, with amazing speed, had put a henna design on the back of her hand, ignoring the fact that she was saying \"No thank you\". She then demanded money to be \"paid for my work\". As fairly seasoned travellers who have been to Morrocco several times we successfully negotiated a very small payment for both incidents but it made our younger friends very wary and slightly soured what could have been an amazing afternoon and evening for them.

You have shops to buy from all around you have street food sizzling around you, snake charmers, story tellers and little monkeys hanging around! An absolute MUST see and experience..BUT beware of the relentless begging that seems to be the job of young children and old women. It's not totally a bad thing though you don't feel threatened only really uncomfortable! The women selling henna are quite rude when they are refused and hardly take no for an answer! Be firm. And walk away.But for us we had to run! The kids started gathering like a hive around us! Insistent unwavering begging, you give one, they are the happiest buy it attracts all the others! our friends behind got a little slap and at that point we high tailed out of their as fast as we could! Tip: always be nice friendly and respectful but firm when you need to be. And you'll enjoy this experience!"

There were locals with snakes everywhere, monkeys with chains on, women harassing you for henna. I prefer to be tucked in the back streets in the souks with all the hidden gems. The food market at night was interesting though, food good but don't get caught out in their traps. One of the guys serving us brought us out each dish each whereas we asked to share these dishes, therefore he charged us double! This is a money scam so be careful and specify exactly what you want- if they do it wrong on purpose do not pay them the extra!"

In reality I was utterly blown away by the size of it, the numerous alleyways, the noise, sights, sounds, smells and the utter ordered chaos of it all.What an amazing experience this place is!Sure there's the usual array of tat for sale by unscrupulous vendors - but there are also a number of serious traders with well made products that are happy to haggle in a polite and respectful way with you to a sensible price for both parties. If you're avoiding obvious designer fakes and going with unbranded local made items you'll be much better off.In the evening the Square transforms into a night food market with fresh orange juice, exotic food types of every description and snake charmers and local musicians and story tellers - a very different sensory experience to the daytime and well worth a 2nd visit.I cannot express just how wondrous this place is and if you've ever been intrigued having seen it in a documentary you need to visit in real life!"

In fact, they do not take no for an answer. If you are not very stern in your NO (La La La in the native tongue), you will soon have henna on your hands and monkeys on your head. They will tell you it is free until you try to walk away. If you do not compensate them, it can get unpleasant. You have ben warned."

Do not take pictures of the entertainment unless you are prepared to pay (or unless you have a telephoto lens). There are monkeys in dresses and snakes including cobras all over the market place with men in local attire charming them with pipes and drums. They will if your not carful simply put one around your neck and charge you for the privilege. At night the locals open up food stalls in the centre which are excellent value. Look for the busy ones. A lot of the food there is brought out Frozen not fresh despite what they will tell you. There are also an abundance of juice sellers. A glass for 4dn. Something like 30p! each. If you can go to one of the elevated restaurants. Not only are they good value for money but offer amazing views over the market but the action is on the street. If you sit at a street side cafe you will draw attention of the street vendors. Watches and sun glasses are mostly on offer here. Not legit but affordable merchandise. They will offer but will seldom persist if you decline. Law of averages they work on. Lose yourself in the surrounding market streets. It's cooler for one and ultimately you can not get lost as it is a walled city but you can walk for miles and miles until you find your way back, but you will experience a different Marrakesh, and not be so troubled by the shop stewards."

Oh and be prepared for the pungent smell as you walk up to the square from Koutoubia mosque - do horses usually smell that bad?!At night the square is filled with food stalls. The storytellers come out sometimes too but their stories seem to only be in Arabic/for locals. There were other forms of entertainment like music on the square too - which drew in a lot of tourists. If you want to hear some traditional stories in English head over to Cafe Clock in Kasbah on a Thursday evening. You can walk it from the square if you're good at navigating.

There are a lot of traders desperate to sell you their wares and will try anything.I did have one altercation with a women wanting to put henna on me. She grabbed my arm and wouldn't take no for answer, so much do I had to get slightly aggressive, she in turn then jabbed her henna needle in my backside. Don't think I've ever been so angry. The men with the monkeys are also quite pushy but do back off if you assert yourself. Putting that aside most vendors were polite and happy.Don't try taking obvious pictures of the snake charmers/monkeys or the colourful men in costume as they will run after you for money(daughter can vouch for that)In the evening the volume of people doubles, the atmosphere and noise is crazy as are all the smells from food, horses and incense, your senses are in overdrive.Soak it up and enjoy it, be aware and don't be afraid to assert yourself, just do it with a smile."

This the main square of Old Marrakech and has a number of restaurants surrounding this square, which offer terraces to sit and watch the busy Moroccan life go by.There are a large number of stalls which offer fresh juices, which are a must try. The old snake charmers were also out on the square, but this was not our cup of tea, and their handling of the snakes was a little upsetting.The hotel Ali which is just of the square offers the best exchange rates for currency conversions.When trying out the horse carriages near the square, be sure to negotiate and agree on an hourly trip. We found this out after we agreed in a price for a \"long trip\" to a number of locations, which only took 35-40 minutes, and included commentary such as \" this is a hotel\", \"this is a hospital\" , \"this is a restaurant\" etc. There is usually a price list stuck on the carriage but you struggle to find it, and no one adheres to the prices anyway.Also be careful of the usual trick of people trying to show you directions, especially to the Berber market or the leather district. If interested, this trick works in the following way: you may be passing by and someone asks if you are looking for the market. He then attempts to point you in a particular direction but somehow miraculously finds a gentleman who is going in the direction. Anyhow, this person walks ahead of you attempting to guide you (we were told that if the police find these guys they are immediately jailed for 3-4 days, hence they usually walk ahead). The goal is to get you into one of the shops under \"no obligation\" where you are pushed into purchasing something.We were taken to a leather /tannery shop owned by a supposedly nice elderly gentleman, which had a view of the tanning workshops from the first floor. Someone else came and explained the view from the first floor, and showed us some goods. As we didn't purchase anything, the old man got very angry and abusive. Anyhow, after we left the shop, the men who explained how the tanning works (referred to themselves as the Berber cooperative) in the shop and our passerby guide appeared with some friends and forced us to pay them a fee for the free explanation by surrounding us in a narrow street. Moral: Avoid this situation, and don't follow random strangers."

If you are a tourist make sure to stand at a distance so you're not expected to give change, but you can get a sense of the local culture.

If you make eye contact with snake charmers or guys with monkeys you will have a snake or monkey on your shoulder whether u want it or not,and then hey demand payment in a most aggressive manner, it is so cruel what they do to those animals- you will see lines of horses and carriages but if you look at the horses ankle you will see the rope they use to tie there legs together to stop them moving to far. Taxi men refuse to turn their meters on and if you don't agree a price before you get in they will charge you treble what it should be- from the square to any hotel in the area it's a max of 30 dirhams. If you really feel the need to go to Marrakech do it for a max of 3 days and spend at least one day in the beautiful mountain region of setti fatma which is on the way to Ourika. From the square to the airport max 100 dirhams. If you have to go to the medina be prepared to haggle,they will not give you a fixed price, if you want to get fixed price go to the centre artisans. It's a beautiful little shopping area and all fixed price."

However the hassling by the vendors, artists, dancers and charmers is incessant. We ate at a seafood stall which was busy with locals and tourists. Decent calamari, cod, chips, aubergine and tomatoes. Costs around 50dirhams a head. We'd been advised against the henna tattoos in the square as they use cheap ink and chemicals...Stopped for a minute or two to watch the dancing - Dropped a few dirhams into a collection hat to be looked at with disgust (what's the going rate then?!). Another collection hat came round not a minute later and we said we'd just tipped, only to be prodded in Arabic for more. We ended up leaving after a minute's chatter. Episodes like that leave you feeling like a walking dollar sign - and a rude one at that: the only way to avoid the hassling is to ignore completely, feign no understanding of any human language.

This is great for an entertaining evening meal at one of the numbered cooking stalls, but don't expect high quality from the 'shows' in the square. It's interesting to see it all together, but the shows are mostly all build-up to generate excitement, with little or no pay-off (I only saw quality entertainment from the music players). If you take photos you will be harassed for money, but they didn't actually try that hard if you just walk off."

Entering the square there are loads of horse-drawn carriages offering tours of Marrakech. Like all things the first price is not the price to pay. The stalls in the square offer all sorts of things, but it is often better to go into the souks to get better pricing. A must to try is the freshly-squeezed orange juice. There are various choices and prices but simply opt for the basic offering at 4Dh. In the evening there are many great places to eat at reasonable prices, and also lost of entertainment, such as singers and snake charmers. The only downside of the square is that you have to watch out for pick-pockets."

Later, the smells and smoke permeate the air adding a eerie glow to the proceedings. I was partial to Mechoui Alley on the east side of Souq Ablueh where I enjoyed slow roasted lamb carved for me for a paltry 50 dh On one corner is the medina, on the other the souks displaying their wares, aggressively pursuing a sale. Around the corner horse and carriages are ready to take you through the city.  My only warnings are the pickpockets operating here and the scam artists.

As day turns into night, the Berber storytellers come out and gather eager customers around their lamps, faces lit by ersatz campfire glow as the sounds of the stringed instruments keep a frenzied rhythm. An occasional horse will clip-clop by, pulling a carriage of tourists--local and not, mouths agape. Smoke rises above the crowds, reflecting and diffusing the electric lights around the perimeter, creating a glowing haze in the air. Come here to feel the heartbeat of the old city before you dive into the warren of the souk; its vast space filling and emptying like a human tide over the course of the day. It is a feast for all the senses, so much to take in. When you've had your fill, you can retire for a while for the traditional pleasures of Moroccan whisky (mint tea) and sugary pastries in one of the bakery/tea shops on a nearby side street. You cannot say you've been to Marrakech without having set foot here."

We decided on 5 days including travelling, which was only a 3 1/2 hour plane flight, and it worked really well. We stayed in a Riad ... please, please stay in a Riad, your experience will be so be so much better than if you stay in a '5 star' all inclusive hotel. Our Riad was in the Medina but far enough away from the main square to be very quiet and calm amidst the daily hustle and bustle of everyday life. Once you go through the big wooden door of your Raid you really are in another world. Jemma El Fna is vibrant, lively and totally bonkers, surrounded by many restaurants in which you can taste the local fayre - mostly Tajines of some kind or another, but we did find some other restaurants (reviewed separately) where you can get very good food not cooked in a clay pot. The Mosc is quite imperious and stands at the top of the Medina and apparently is the oldest in the country. The Souks are plentiful and sell local goods as well as some more touristy items. Always haggle! The spice Souks are interesting although I was not particularly wanting to buy spices which had been sat on the side of a dusty alley. However, one of our cooks took my partner to a spice shop not exposed to the elements where they ground the spices in front of him, and it was quite reasonable considering. We undertook a number of excursions during our five days which made it a busy break rather than a relaxing one but the culture of the old town is second to none and the architecture and history is amazing. A definite place to cross off your list. Would we go back? Probably, but only after we have explored many other countries. Have fun, haggle and don't be fooled by the stories the locals spin you"

Be warned you do get has hassled by all of the venders. However a firm no and they leave you alone. We were quite distressed by the animal cruelty that happens on the square. There are snake charmers and monkeys. The monkeys are chained by their necks to their owners, who encouraged tourists to pay money to have their photos with them. We found this distressing. Besides this it is inserting to see hustle and bustle of the Marrakesh square. It comes alive at night."

Think of it as live-action channel-surfing: everywhere you look in the Djemaa el-Fna, Marrakesh\u2019s main square and open-air theatre, you\u2019ll discover drama already in progress. The hoopla and halqa (street theatre) has been non-stop here ever since this plaza was the site of public executions around AD 1050 \u2013 hence its name, which means \u2018assembly of the dead\u2019.By 10am, the daily performance is under way. Snake charmers blast oboes to calm hissing cobras; henna tattoo artists beckon to passers by; water-sellers in fringed hats clang brass cups together, hoping to drive people to drink.The show doesn\u2019t peak until shadows fall and 100 chefs arrive with grills in tow, cueing musicians to tune up their instruments. This is a show you don\u2019t want to miss \u2013 but stay alert to horse-drawn-carriage traffic, pickpockets and rogue gropers. Arrive early in the evening to nab prime seats on makeshift stools (women and elders get preference).Applause and a few dirhams ensure an encore. It's a bargain show, and critically acclaimed too: for bringing urban legends and oral history to life nightly, Unesco declared the Djemaa el-Fna a \u2018Masterpiece of World Heritage\u2019 in 2001."

I've been in another markets before in Agadir, Essaouira, and Rabat and all the shopkeepers made fun about Marrakesh (\"you can come in and take a look, we won't grab you and chase you for miles\"). I always thought that it was just a common joke and couldn't be that bad. But i was wrong.First of all, let me say that it is beautiful indeed, specially at night, with all the music and all the vibrant colors on the main square. It is also a market where you can find absolutely anything you want during the day. However, even if you like haggling, this place gets annoying after a few minutes. They literally chase you after you said 5 times \"no\", trying to get you to change your mind or visiting his cousin's shop. Restaurants are even worse. They battle to show the menu, and i got seriously annoyed when one guy grabbed my arm because he insisted to show me the menu and the prices, even when i told him that i had lunch already.Beware of the snake charmers and monkey trainers, if you take a picture with them on it, they will ask you for money, and in absurd amounts (20DHM for a picture? come on..)Maybe i was tired after a long trip around morocco, or maybe i got used to all the other markets in different cities actually treating people with respect.It is a must see, but make sure you go relaxed, well rested and with huge amounts of patience"

If a lady want to put Henna on your hand (she says 1 little flower for free), just pull your hand cause she will finish a big hennatatoo and asks for money. Just don't pay for stuff you didn't ask for. If you want, 20 till 30 dirham is a good price (some will ask you 250). Always bargain! With evertyting!Don't buy souvernirs around the square, here it's more expencive and the man are rude. You can find nicer ones in the streets around in the Medina.The food looks good but they sell left-over food from the day before. Some dishes are pretty good but be picky.Go to discover other smallers cities like Chefchouen before the rudeness of Marrakesh people ruins you.. In other places people are so friendly! You'll find them in Marrakesh as wel but you have to be carefully.The jucebars on the square are pretty amazing!! If you got lost, just ask the shopowners for the big square.

I have been to Morocco many a times and this was no different apart from it being just my daughter and I. The only thing to be vary off is if you\u2019re a female on your own which can be extremely daunting. We were followed around by a male who decided to walk alongside us asking what we were planning to buy, if we wanted any Argan hair oils and if we would like him to accompany us to the souks where we would get good deals, his English was very good. I politely declined his offer yet he chose to walk and try and make conversation. As there are many people we blended in around crowds and soon lost him. The second encounter was when I requested to see a bracelet which was priced extremely high, the cost was not revealed to me at first, I asked to see this and before I knew it the bracelet was being tied on my wrist, I said I was just browsing and not interested to buy this, I was suddenly surrounded by 3 men who kept asking me how much I was willing to pay, I said I was not interested and felt as though they were invading my private space as they were so very close to me. We somehow managed to get the message across and leave. A word of advice is not to venture too further into the Souks (markets) on your own! Now back into the busy square after 15 minutes of trying to find our way out of the maze. I heard a lady say \u201cHenna tattoo henna tattoo\u201d, again I politely declined and said \u201cShukran\u201d which in Arabic is no thanks. She grabbed my hand and in English said \u201cdon\u2019t worry it\u2019s no cost, I will just do a small pattern for good luck and marriage\u201d. Before I knew it she pushed me towards another lady who was working alongside her and she quickly started to paint henna over the WHOLE of my hand. I looked over to my side and the original lady was doing the same on my daughter. I kept saying \u201cNo\u201d and she said \u201cNo problem\u201d. After the henna had been done roughly 20 seconds they started to demand money!! I felt so scared. It came to a point where they demanded 300 dirham. I said I didn\u2019t have that sort of money, they said give us English money meaning \u00a3\u2019s. I said I had no change, they even went as far as saying they would give me change. Again I said I had none and they then started asking for my lipstick\u2026. My daughter was terrified, I was then told to the bank directly opposite and get cash, one of the ladies said she was watching me and not to make her angry. No security could be seen. I walked over to the bank and ran to the left without looking back daughter in tow. We grabbed the first Petite taxi and went straight home. As I have said before this is not my first time here but certainly the first time as a female with a child on her own- Not a place for the Tourist Female. Beware and politely decline gestures of FREEBIES! If possible always try and travel in groups or have a guide."

Worth grabbing a drink on one of the overlooking roof terraces but recommend eating in the food stalls themselves - as with any late night food stall they earlier you go the fresher the food will be."

Every time you take a photo you will be expected to pay someone a fee. The food is not safe to eat. The cooking methods are unhygienic and the plates and utensils are often just scraped off and not properly washed before being reused.

Their food looked a little old and before you could really look at the food, they would try to shove a menu in your face so you couldn't look at how fresh the food was that they would serve you. At this point we adopted the phrase I have already ate just to look and see. It was all about the same.

Keep away from them because once you are drawn in they will not let you go without your giving them money. There are more beggars at this time of day. In the afternoon there are the storytellers. This is an ancient Berber and Arabic custom and there is little point in joining the throng around the teller unless you speak the language. There are also belly dancers and stalls selling orange and other juices, nuts and spices, false teeth, stuffed animals and anything else you might wish to buy. As evening descends the square is populated by pop-up restaurants all of whom have been patronised by Jamie Oliver or Rick Stein.

The very first thing we noticed about this square, was the number of people that are here. The sheer volume locals here is overwhelmingly and a wonderful sight for tourist to see the hustle bustle of the nightlife in Marrakech.There were stalls for all types of goods, from juices to dates, to pottery to pashmina scarves. You can find many of the local products in this square. You can even begin walking through some alleys here that eventually takes you to the Medina! If you intend to shop, be prepared to barter with them. Ask for the price, feel free to say no and they will counter offer you with a \"how much?\", this is when the negotiations and the fun begins. Ensure you have plenty of space in your luggage as you will find that there are so many local products on sale here. Remember, there are dozens of stalls that sell the same goods, so be patient and wait for the right deal.In the evening, you will smell the aroma of grilled meat and fried calamari! The smells alone are amazing for the nose and you will find yourself exploring the many stalls open for trade. Be warned, you will be approached by many of the locals tempting you in to their stall so you can part way with your money. My only advice here is to look for somewhere that's busy with local people as I found this is where the better quality food is served. One last thing, once you are seated, be prepared to say no to whatever they push on you. I found that in a couple of the food stalls we sat down at, they automatically serve you things you don't wish to eat as a way of making you pay more, so don't be afraid to be firm and say no.If like me, you are of the oriental look, be prepared for some casual racism. Don't be too offended, there is nothing malicious about them as I found them very nice people. It wasn't just me but also other \"exotic\" looking tourists to the locals."

Ensure you always haggle on prices for things you are being sold, including horse and cart rides and tuk tuk rides. Be sure to check out the souks too, and also the side street where you can buy hunks of cooked lamb to eat with bread!We enjoyed the brief experience there, but felt there were other places in Marrakech we preferred to eat (without the price hike of Jemaa el Fna) and places we were far less hassled."

We had a rental car and there is a small carpark right next to the entrance of the square and also a carpark couple of mins away. There is a KFC which the kids loved and many many eating options in the evening. BEWARE if you walk through the eating stalls to be hassled by almost every food stall. AVOID food stall 81, the people appear friendly, but were very pushy and EXTREMELY RUDE to us when we refused to have food there... Shopping in the souks is a great experience, I recommend you do not buy the first item that you like, because you will come across the same item further on. Try and ascertain what the lowest price the seller is willing to offer. This will give you an idea of the price next time you see that item. Always smile and be friendly when haggling and if the price doesn't suit you then be firm and say thank you and walk away, in most cases you will be followed or asked to come back, but tell them your finial price and walk away. You will find bargains and some great stuff, but more then anything enjoy the atmosphere of the busy souks. There are cafes dotted around the square with roof top terraces, which I would highly recommend to sit and have a drink or snack and take in the atmosphere of the square. I would also recommend a ride on the horse and cart but you will do well to agree a total price before you get on. We did a tour during an afternoon and also one during a night time."

The main square in Marrakech is much like any other city's focal point in that it's a great location to start your day or a great meeting point,as it is situated just across from the tallest building in Marrakech, the Katouibia mosque.Filled with market traders who ply their trade from sunrise to sunset, snake charmers, performing monkeys, horse rides and then street performers who come out at night, the square is rarely dormant.The best way to appreciate its vibrant nature is to find one of the many cafes with roof terraces around the square and sample a mint tea. Here you will avoid being plagued to buy hand carved wooden camels, have snakes draped around your neck or feel compelled to buy yet another 'Prada' bag and still be able to people watch to your heart's content."

We found a spot in a restaurant overlooking the square near sunset and watched sunset unfold with the constant sound of snake charmer flutes in the distance. The cost of the drinks was about 30 DAM, but it allowed us to remain at our perch as long as we wanted. Down in the square we found that the juice sellers were marvelous. A glass of orange juice was 4 DAM and a combo drink of grapefruit juice, orange juice and lime juice was 10 DAM and the best drink we had in all of Morocco. We went back for this combination several times. Very sweet. We took a turn venturing into one of the snake charmer activities and they swarm you, taking your camera, putting non-venomous snakes around your neck and then engulfing you with demands for 500 DAM, an extortionate amount of money. I initially gave them 50 DAM, then upped it to 150 DAM, before walking away with them screaming and hassling us. That was unpleasant."

After taking a picture the request for money started. I didn't give enough. Next person I gave the requested extra dirhams but again this STILL wasn't enough so up went the amount. The next vendor said there were 2 of us so it had to be double the amount. Seems that any amount I paid was not enough. I wandered to a group of people around some musicians and the hat went out for money but as I was just wandering by I said no. Well he rose up like a conductor and swished his arms and the music stopped and they all turned to stare at me. That was the end for me. I just wanted to go back to my inviting riad and get away from all the hassle. I don't think I am faint hearted as I have haggled with the best of them in Vietnam and Cambodia but I think I was tired and it was all very \"in your face\".

Beware the vendors selling jewelry or henna tattoos as they will try to grab you and make you pay for a bracelet or some tattoo before you know it's on you. It's also so hot during the day (were there in late June) which means you will want to find shade at a nearby cafe or in the souks.During the evening, the square lights up. I recommend finding a restaurant/cafe on the square to sit in around sunset and watch the square transform from day to night. We went to Cafe Glacier which seems to have the best views (though not the best service). It's truly incredible. At night, an entire market of food vendors pops up, lots of smells everywhere.

Our score of 4 of 5 doesn't come from performance level, but from watching a local crowd. It is amazing, but the square is filled more with locals than with tourist.

I'm somebody who doesn't like shopping anyway, Jema El Fna is a market good for buying gifts to take back home, souvenirs and finding those Moroccon cultural bits. It's not an everyday shopping place for clothes, perfumes, household stuff, although you can get genuine designer fakes if you like that sort of thing. Prepare to be bothered a little by shop keepers/workers to come and have a look around, if you're going to buy I suggest you haggle to half price as they ask for double or sometimes even triple the actual price knowing you're a tourist or a foreigner. One outstanding good thing from the market is that you can book excursions from here at a lot cheaper price than what they will be asking at the hotel. We booked the Atlas Mountains tour via a team at the market (which includes transfers) for 200 dirams pp whereas our hotel was asking for 860 dirams pp!

We was abit worried about coming out as 3 young women but it's not that scary, we did go as a group of us but you don't have to worry, if you tell the people no then they will leave you alone. You have street performers there and henna tattoos, it is a lovely place to go and visit even if your not into shopping. I would recommend going at least once in your holiday. If you go with a coach trip like we did they drop you off outside the mosque so if at any point you get lost just look for the mosque and it will lead you back. I know you might be thinking how will you see it but it is the highest point so just look up and follow it. We didn't really buy much just went to see what it was like but if you are interested in shopping there please make sure you don't get ripped off.. They will put the price high expecting you to haggle with them. If they don't budge on the price then just act like you aren't bothered and walk away, they will soon follow you and say that they will do it for a special price just for you and not to tell anyone.

Perhaps this is because we went out of season? But they were all food stalls with the owners shouting at the top of their lungs at us to try taste and buy their goodies. Not really very pleasant when you're just looking and exploring the area.Most of the stalls which sell tourist gifts and traditional Moroccan things are tucked away and the majority to my dismay sold fake knock off bags, clothes and trainers. The odd one sold lanterns, candles and leather bags.

If they come near you just say no and continue walking- best thing to do is not to make eye contact when you dont want to be bothered by someone- i was adviced by locals not to eat meat or snails at jmaa el fna be (only in restaurants just to be sure that it is well cooked)"

A quick \"La shukraan\" (no thank you) goes a long way. Bear in mind that once they do hook onto you, you will be parting with money.One further point to be made aware of is that if you start pointing your camera towards these locals/hawkers, will be asked for money. Gangs of sort do operate there and have eyes everywhere. I joke you not. They can spot a camera coming out at a 100 yds.I guess in some respects its little to pay when you consider that this is their sole source of income."

Keep walking through and watch, do not stop unless you want to pay for something.Show disinterest and do not look interested in any thing. Sun glasses help as they watch your eyes. You can then enjoy the place and take it in. A good tip is to use the nearby restaurants for a drink. 50p for a bottle of Coke. Normally I would happily give money but this is where tourists are pure prey and any mild interest causes an unwanted interaction which becomes very annoying and tiring. It takes a lot to make them go without getting angry. In reality there is nothing you can't buy from a shop elsewhere.

My traveling companion, kept instructing me to stop making eye contact with people and they would abandon their approach. It seemed to be working for her. But what do I say? I'm a connector, and the youngest in my family so don't like to be ignored. I offered a polite but firm no merci and it usually worked after the 3rd or 4th firm time with a raised voice and a smile. They are persistent people and this was their livelyhood so I sort of get it. It was suggested to me that we hire a male guide the first time going, but I was surprised at that suggestion based on my New York daily living. I personally did not find the guide necessary, but if you do not have a strong sense of direction, make sure you note some clear markers for yourself to exit. I would not have been comfortable going alone though. Be careful because people will grab your hand to put goods into it. The best and most surprising shopping experience I had was while I was soon to exit the square was with two young girls were hard at work. The older one, probably no older than 10 was selling little toys with lights that shoot into the air for a modest 20 dirhams. The younger one which I assumed was her sister approached me with a little package of tissue. I had no need for the very practical tissue, but my nephew would appreciate the other not so practical item I purchased. I did not have anymore 10 coins, and told her no merci, but reached in my bag and gave her what I had. A single dirham. My intent was to give her something so she too \"made a sell\" though I did not require the goods. She looked at the coin, looked me up and down, then returned it to me and walked away. I just stood there with my mouth hanging open. That story illustrates there are serious business people of all ages in Marrakech."

You have to experience this place at least once in your lifetime, it can be a little over-whelming at first but once you get used to the place it is amazing, the whole square is busy all the time with lots going on, especially in the evening when the whole square seems to come to life.You do need to be aware that you will get hassle of street vendors and everywhere you turn someone will try and sell you something. Also if you take a photo of the snake charmers or water sellers or any of the street entertainers you will be expected to pay them so make sure you take plenty of smaller notes and coins and don't let them see you have more cash.My friend got accosted by a lady doing henna tattoos and even though she said she didn't want one the woman grabbed her hand and did one anyway and then demanded money, she would not leave us alone until we had paid her....The roof top terraces are a must for watching the world go by either during the day or by night and the prices for food and drink vary quite a bit from place to place but on the whole very reasonable...If you want to get some cheap souvenirs the market stalls and souks are a great place to start and you can pick up some real bargains...The fresh juice stalls are a must and for 4 MAD you get a glass of freshly squeezed OJ and the bottles of water are really cheap too.All in all a great experience."

At night time it was completely different! At first we just enjoyed wandering round, looking at the different things going on, until a snake charmer demanded 300 dirhams for taking a picture. We gave him 100 dirhams and walked away but he followed us, shouting that we had not given enough money. Then a henna tattoo woman grabbed my daughter's hand and tried to give her a tattoo saying it was free. My daughter managed to pull her hand away and we walked off. Another guest at the Hotel we were staying at said the same thing had happened to her so she allowed the woman to give her a tattoo as she had said it would be free, then when it was done she charged her 300 dirhams for it.We were also constantly hassled by the food stallholders to eat at their stalls. This we took all in good fun as some of them were coming out with hilarious sayings, but this changed when we actually decided to sit at one of the stalls and eat. Because we didn't order the more expensive food that the stallholder wanted us to have, he suddenly became stroppy, even telling us we couldn't have what we wanted until we showed him it was actually on his menu. The food was nothing special either. After we paid and left we were walking across the square when a stallholder from a different stall ran after us, asking why we hadn't eaten at his stall. He got quite aggressive with us and started calling us names, loudly!! After this we had had enough and decided to go back to our Hotel, having decided not to make eye contact with anybody anymore. What had started off as an enjoyable evening, we felt had been ruined by the aggressive behaviour of some of the people. We knew there would be beggars, that if you show interest in something on a stall or shop you will be hassled to buy it, that you would have to pay if you took a photograph, but what we weren't prepared for was the aggression shown to us. Maybe it is because we were two women on our own. This was our first evening here and it left a sour note. Thank goodness for the friendly staff where we were staying and for the lovely people we met over the following few days but we made sure we didn't go back to the square again. On a future trip to Marrakech I most probably would go back there, but I definitely will not eat at one of the stalls."

After our carriage ride we were dropped off at Lotus Privilege for a wonderful dinner and entertainment. The group loved the evening."

Preferably from the balcony of a cafe. Arrive late afternoon, get a pot of mint tea, watch the square come alive for the evening, and then venture down to eat at a stall. We found ourselves spending several afternoons/evenings this way. Sunset over the square is great.If you're getting harassed then simply smile, shake your head, and continue walking - do not engage beyond saying \"no\".

The square can get very busy with many people and stalls during the day but it's all part of the moroccan experince. You will get many stall holders trying to get your attention by continuasly calling you, but my best advice is just firmly but politely say no once and when they continue badgering you just completely ignore them and carry on. I personally feel it's pointless repeating to them again and again when they just take no notice of you when you say no. Also ladies beware for women who grab your hand to apply potentially harmful henna on you and then ask for an extremely high price afterwards. Do not let them as you have no idea what chemials they have added to the henna. If you really want to apply henna go to a reliable place like a hammam or cafe."

Accept what you order and know the prices. Dont get into with the people, be clear and say no and walk away. They very purchased. If u stand still to look at something, dance snakes or what ever, its not for free. So if u find out the rules on the square relax and have fun. Rooftops are expensive but nice views!"

During the day it is time for the snake charmers to do their stuff and also for the men with the monkeys (as I don't agree with the way the animals are treated we refused photos with any of these).There are plenty of traders selling orange juice for 4 dirhams but the one we bought front number 45 tried to rip us off so be careful as they will try it on and try and get extra money from you.In the evening is when the street food stalls set up we tried the food one evening and weren't disappointed. They will put bread and olives on the table as soon as you sit down and do charge for this but it's best to just go with the flow.We used a couple of cafes that are dotted around the edge of the square just to do some people watching and take in some refreshments."

It is very different during the day, compared to the night. You should try to see the square at both times. Calmer and more peaceful during the day, where one can comfortably avoid a lot of the hassle, and enjoy a glass of juice or a bite to eat. Come sunset, the place is transformed and the constant drumming from various drummers and other musicians plays well into the night. So many different things to see, from story-tellers, to snake charmers, to many many places to eat. This place can be frustrating as well, with people hassling you constantly, to buy this or that or eat here and there. There are also numerous people begging, especially little children, so it can be hard to bear sometimes. Of course, if one wants to give charity, they can do so. I found that the best is sometimes to give food or drink. A bottle of Pepsi seems to be something the kids really want!In terms of food in the square during the night time, prices are reasonable, and food is of a decent quality (depending on what you get). Plenty of choice, from tagines to kebabs, to snails etc. We only ate there once and found it OK. However, one guy in particular seemed to take offence that we did not eat at his stall, and ate at someone else's stall. He did behave very strangely - he seemed to think we had promised him we would eat at his stall, when we clearly hadn't. All the stalls pretty much sell the same food at the same prices. I would suggest eating here once, just to feel the atmosphere etc, but after that it is better to eat elsewhere - there are plenty of good restaurants/take-aways near by for a fraction of the price. Take a walk down from the Bab Agnaou - lots of nice places to eat for a few \u00a3s! There is also a nice cafe here called Cafe Glace which has brilliant views of the square from high up. Have a cup of mint tea whilst watching the scene down below...A word of warning in the square - it seems everyone here is to try make as much money of you as possible, from crazy prices to asking for money for showing you the way somewhere! Be wary of anyone who wants to show you something, or when you ask for directions, they want to physically show you where you need to go - they will ask you for money showing you the way! Even looking at someone or something (e.g. looking at the snake charmers), they will want money from you. Taking pictures of such things - you will be asked for money too!The Jemma El Fna square can be a fun place to be, but have your wits about you at all times to make sure you have a great time. And try not to take some people too seriously - it'll help you keep sane!"

It can be a little overwhelming and there are always sellers harassing you, but its so lively and full of all sorts of things. You must see the medina and the souks in it by getting lost, it is the only true way. So go on ahead and take a fork and see where it leads! Careful of the scooters! Careful of pickpockets and overpaying for things. Most things are fake. There's a lot of great food though--we actually didn't get sick, but that might be case by case."

No thankyou in french goes a long way and so does a smile. Prepare for the odd wierdo that is present anywhere in the world you go as you will get comments if you are female only group or solo. H'shuma is arabic for shame on you, use this if you get harrassed a little too much for your liking. It will attract other locals that will defend you. Once you've learnt to cope with the odd bod you will really enjoy Marrakech. May i say we wanted to leave after our first day here as we were ripped off, felt unsafe and had abuse thrown at us. Sod 'em and don't let it ruin it because since that day we got into the marrakech flow and had an amazing time, we are gutted to be leaving after a week of being here! Must visit food stall number 1 with the female cook, a recommendation from trip advisor and an absolute must visit for Roti d'or, unbelievable food and the cheapest we had here! Going back for a double dose tonight! Enjoy fellow travellers!"

When you order your meal make sure you get what you order . Because usually they bring you different staff as well and you end up paying double . 2 people pay around 130- 160 dram . Not more than that . Fresh juices are very cheap around 4 dram. If you want to buy things make sure you offer less price . Their fiat price is always high and they go almost half or 1/3 . Never pay what they ask . About food that all restaurant has menu . So make sure you see the prices .have a good trip"

We read a lot of reviews regarding harassment from the souks and the Jemaa el Fna before we visited in March - now I don't know whether it was to do with the time of year or the fact we are both around the age of 21 but we hardly got harassed at all. The only time we got harassed was when we decided to walk straight down the middle of the food market which was our own fault as all you have to do is walk around it to prevent being harassed. If you ignore them they just don't bother with you so don't let the harassment reviews put you off because we experienced very little and we walked through the souks every day for a week. However, if you feel very strongly about animal rights then this might not be the place for you as the way they treat animals here is horrendous. They lock monkeys in tiny boxes with no windows and keep them on chains, the donkeys and horses are in terrible conditions and over worked - so this will be a massive culture shock for most people but this is their culture so even though it's not right it is worth visiting to see how different cultures treat animals."

I've been to markets all over Asia but it's a little more difficult here. Watch out for the henna tattoo ladies. They will come up and grab your arm and start putting it on you straight away, asking you questions they are very forceful and will tell you it's free because you are beautiful then their colleagues come over and you are ripped off. Put your hands behind your back if they try and keep walking. The touts don't ask you if you want a specific item, they will start asking your life story to engage you and even follow you quite a distance of you keep replying. I usually just said no thanks and kept walking. And don't let anyone \"show you where ur hotel is\" or show you around the stalls because they will demand money from you. Favours don't go free here.Stay away from the animals. There are monkeys in nappies with chain leads on, please don't pay for a photo they are treated horrendously.

A dinner for two can easily cost the equivalent of 60USD if you don't say no to the suggestions. Definitely an experience to be had. Pay attention to the crowds. Though I didn't experience it, this place is a pickpocket's paradise. It's very easy for your attention to be taken by the street performers or snake charmers while your valuables are taken by someone in the passing crowd. The best values are \"snail soup\" and freshly squeezed juices. A bowl of delicious steaming snails in broth is less than the equivalent of 1USD while an orange juice squeezed in front of you will run about 0.40USD. Fresh fruit and dates are also in abundance."

The hustle and bustle becomes apparent and you'll have a better sense of the people after their siesta style period.Snake charmers, fruit stalls, olive markets and souvenirs are all on offer and the food is exceptional in pretty much every place you visit. Surprisingly, the cost is lower than in other parts of Marrakesh."

Me and my partner went through the day and at night and whilst we've been and it was vibrant and entertaining we just couldn't shake an uneasy feeling. Everyone is out to make a fast buck from the tourist which can be relentless at times, however this was expected as it was a market... it was more worrying though that it felt you were being eyed up for an easy opportunity at every turn and not by market stall sellers...even away from the market areas you felt you were being studied. Like every city you really have to keep your wits about you.Felt sorry for the monkeys on leashes and hated the snakes...just creepy. Liked being away from the hustle and bustle and watching from some of the rooftop terraces and some amazing pictures to be had. if going through the sooks I would recommend getting a reputable tour guide...otherwise you may get lost although everyone is willing to help you get back...for a price of course!! Food was great from the stalls...the smells just tempt you in and so many to choose from, street food at its best. As I said must place to visit and tick off your bucket list but personally wouldn't rush back!!"

Whilst relatively calm during the day from mid / late afternoon it teems with performers and hawkers of every type all wrapped up in a cacophony of noise from the musicians. In the very centre there are countless food stalls although fairly, or otherwise, our local guide warned us off them. Jemaa El Fna is a buzz and and experience but my wife and I soon tired of it. After a while the noise, eternal sales pitches from sometimes quite aggressive sellers just gets to be too much. Maybe I'm cynical, maybe I'm just utterly boring and shouldn't be allowed out, but I found the square to be little more than a convenient place to get as many tourists together with the single objective of fleecing them of their money."

It's great fun to walk around and see what all the shops have to offer. There are a number of Orange juice stalls who will be shouting to get your attention! They will also give out free tasters to entice you in for a drink. I would highly recommend getting yourself to a stall and getting a freshly squeezed OJ! They are very sweet and you can't go wrong for 40 dhirams. There will be snake charmers, be wary of them as they will shake your hand and try to get a snake over your neck and then ask for money. I would stay alert when around them, however it's good to just walk over and see the snakes. Don't take pictures unless you are prepared to pay them.There are a number of food outlets, so you are are spoilt for choice on foods! This place is a must visit, especially at night when the whole square becomes even more alive. A visit during the day AND night is a must. Try to have dinner on a roof top terrace and watch the people of Marrakech go by during the night. It is an excellent experience and you will throughly enjoy this."

If you're lucky, snake charmers will entrance you and the snake - be sure to leave coins.At night, try the delicious snail soup and broth. Watch acrobats - they aren't really dancers.

After walking around the medina and visiting the most recommended sites I can honestly say that the Square is the most lively and exciting placebo go to. During the day there are juice stalls and a few stalls selling brick a brack, but at night at around 6pm the food stalls open and the crowds gather. There are loads of random things happening in the square, we saw a group of teenage boys doing basic acrobatics, snake charmers, men with pulling monkeys around, groups of men dressed in traditional clothing playing music and dancing and most random of all, people doing boxing, but not underground fighting, more like a middle aged man (in his smart winter jacket) trying to prove that he's still got it while swinging at a young guy who was clearly darting around and trying not to hurt him. It was unclear at this point whether the older man had paid to spar with him as everything that happens in the square seems to cost something. I got bored and left. Anyway lots happening and when you walk through the food stalls the workers will always try to grab you and usher you into their stalls. As mentioned by loads of fellow trip advisors, don't give in, just smile and keep walking until you pick a place you want to eat at. Me and the Mrs tried 3 stalls over 2 nights. The number one stall, which sold boiled snails, this tasted mainly of bay leaf to us and I wasn't able to appreciate the taste, though the locals I'm sure would disagree as they kept downing the broth that came with it and couldn't get enough of it. The second place we ate at was stall 98 mustapha, as it was recommended by a fellow trip advisor. They sold fried stuff: fries, calamari Moroccan style fish. It was decent, but had nothing on my local fish n chip shop at home. The aubergine was nice though. Also as others have mentioned nothing is free at the stalls other than bread and tomato salsa which my Mrs loved. The last place we ate to date at and is also my recommendation was stall number 31 Hasan. We were going to eat at this place last night but it was super busy and I didn't want to queue, but today we got there just after it had opened and they had about 10 locals sitting there eating already. This place sells grilled meats as well as tagines and like all the other stalls, you get given free bread and salsa. We ordered grilled sausage and mixed skewers which were hot and tasty as well as fried aubergines and olives. the best bit though was that we had the privilege of sitting next to the boss who was making some meat patties at the time. This old fellow was super friendly and welcoming. He did his best to speak English with us and made sure that our food was cooked for us straight away. Last word of advice, at busy stalls be prepared to be squashed. You sit on these little benches which the owners will keep adding people to until you elbows are digging into ur neighbours ribs. I say don't get annoyed though and just go with it, the locals don't mind so why should we."

They all seem to speak good English - so you can't even tell them that you don't understand (ha ha). If you take a photo of a snake charmer, or a man with a monkey, they will expect payment. I walked through the square on my own on one occasion - and I wouldn't recommend this for the reasons I have pointed out above."

Packed with food stalls, all competing for tourists to eat at their stall. Go to a stall that is busy, it indicates food is fresh and good. One stall sang 'Shakira Waka Waka' until we ate there. They were great fun and let us go behind the stall for a dance and a picture. It was amusing watching them trying to stop tourists with their charm and wit."

Pay special attention at the evening food stalls because their hawking became significantly more aggressive. Two men tried to block our path. Also be prepared to strike hard bargains. We suggest starting to practice bargaining with small purchases before undertaking larger ones. There are valuable lessons to be learned from your initial forays into bargaining. All that being said, however, this is a vibrant and visually arresting area. The best time to visit is from just before sundown until the later evening hours. There are street performers, food vendors, henna artists (who will grab your hand and start applying before you can say no- literally), labyrinthine side streets full of shops, and every imaginable colorful character. Also note that our impression is that the higher quality items are found much deeper into the side streets off the main square whereas the cheaper touristy stuff is found closer to the main square. Have fun!"

It is the UNESCO World Heritage site since 1985. The squire is located just adjacent to old medina. A labyrinth of complicated streets opens into the squire which presents so many attractions to the spectators such as snake charmers, monkey mongers, acrobats, magicians, mystics, dancers, musicians, herb sellers, story-tellers, dentists, pickpockets, juice sellers, sweet stallers and entertainers in traditional dresses. There are a large number of restaurants and food stalls in the squire which offer food at reasonable price. The squire is an amusing place after the evening for those who love entertainment, color and enjoyment. A visit to Marrakesh is never complete without an evening visit to this squire."

Just avoid the constant shouting and screaming by the vendors to grab your attention. Make sure you ask for a plastic cup ( glass ones are just rinsed in a tub of local water)The square feeds a few souks (markets) so it's a good place to start walking. It all comes alive after dark where the food stalls come up and again the vendors try and get you into their stall. We went where we saw majority locals and we enjoyed the following. 2 soup only stalls. Awesome soup (Harira, 3D, ~ \u00a30.25) a bowl. We loved it. Bread, egg or olives were a bit extra. We were the only ones having just 1 bowl!!A couple of stalls just selling sausages (Markaiz). I bought a sandwich for 20D (\u00a31.5). Fantastic. Families were just sitting there dipping them in a tomato salsa. We are 3 nights at #1, Aisha's stall. Couscous, mixed grills, etc. See separate review soon. Great service, lovely people to talk to. Lots of weird shows of dancers, snake charmers and ladies doing henna. Plenty of other shops around the square and a book fair at one end when we were there. Gets quite noisy, we used to be there between 1900-2200. It's the highlight of the old city after dark. "

Absolutely must have is snails, even if you don't like frenchor kretan snails, you will live this, taste is amazing, you also need to try lamb (I am nit a big fun, but Morrocan ona is wonderful and tender) and traditional tee. It's also an adventure (during the daytime) to go a bit further from the main place, you will get to more lical market, with fresh(alive) chicken and stuff like that.

Be careful of your belongings during any crowded situation. Keep valuables in front pockets and wear the backpack in the front.2. If you want to buy stuff like scarves, leather bags, and other souvineres, this is the place to do it. It will likely be cheaper than the small shops your tour guides take you. Remember no prices are fixed (including SIM cards). Aim for 60% of the offered price and be willing to walk away and shop around.3. Go in the late afternoon where there is still light (so you can see the sights/ things you're buying) and when it's not too hot. An added bonus is that the sunset over the mosque beside the square is beautiful.4. Wear respectable clothes. Although morocco is quite liberal, they are still a Muslim country. We are travellers and guests in their country."

We've been told by the locals that they are not poor as their fathers/ husbands are working and this is how the wife and kids make some money.Make sure to haggle prices when you are buying anything from the shops, you can knock down the price more than half. If they charge you 200dms, they will knock it to 100dms, keep saying no and if he ain't budging then walk out his shop, he will then drop it.The deeper into the market you go the cheaper the items will become, and oh boy it is a BIG market, spent 3-4 hours inside!Over all the experience is nice and something different, a must visit place."

The noise and the buzz during the evening was brilliant. There are lots of gatherings of story tellers, musicians and street performers, and there are plenty of cheap food stalls. During the day there are a lot of people trying to sell overpriced souvenirs and cigarettes, snake charmers, henna stalls and horse and carriage rides, but be prepared to pay for photographs!It is a very safe area and is well patrolled by guards. Try to visit one of the cafes with a roof terrace for a wonderful view."

High pressure salesmanship going on all the time -- you just have to ignore it. The rows of competing cheap food stalls are a feature -- noisy, brash, and something one has to experience once in one's life. Can't really imagine anybody wanting to eat there more than once! No bills are issued for the food and drinks consumed -- we had a big row with a head honcho who tried to sell me a whole chicken although I insisted over and again that a half chicken was just fine. I got a plate with chicken bits and pieces on it, and when payment time came he tried to charge me twice the price I was prepared to pay. Big standoff, and raised voices! So I paid him for the half chicken I had ordered, got up and left. I bet that thousands of European visitors are charged the wrong prices, but pay up anyway......... my advice is to work the bill out for yourself, and have enough small notes and coins to pay it exactly."

The souks around the main square are very samey the stalls selling pretty much the same stuff but if you are willing to haggle then it could be fun if you don't want to buy just walk away saying no thank you as as soon as you look or stop they will swoop saying good price etc. Best advice is enjoy the atmosphere and keep you hands tugged away if your a girl as if not careful a henna tattoo may appear that you may not want!

            "review": "A must see - in day and night!. We took the advice of our Riad (Dar Anika) manager Antonio and went to the square on two separate occasions. It really is and experience like no other on earth! By day there are loads of stalls selling orange juice (just the ticket after you've been walking out in the sun), and just hundreds of people - from snake charmers everywhere you look to blokes with monkeys who will take advantage of you for a pic (if you don't want this, just walk on by), to ladies trying to henna your hand (again, if you don't want this, a polite 'no' and walk on by). It's a bustling area and just totally out of this world. Our best tip? Grab a coffee or drink on the terraces of the nearby hotels, cafes or riads - better still a rooftop advantage position to look at all this going on without the hassle of sellers and such. You can take it all in at your own speed. By night, the square turns into a totally different place! It's where all the locals gather to catch up on the latest news with their friends, pull up benches into little groups and play drums, sing and play traditional instruments. We soon found the best way to enjoy this is to throw in some coins - and then you are welcome to watch and join in. It's basically the locals having a night out with their friends, not really for tourist entertainment or taking pics (some groups frown upon this). but it is a great experience! There's also a lot of smoke and fires from the food stalls in the middle of the square, and other things going on, such as dancing, people gathered around to hear traditional tales - and even dentistry - actual dentists pulling teeth live in the square (again, not really for entertainment, but it is entertaining to watch!) You really have to experience it! Our top tips: 1 - remember how you entered the square - as you enter, turn around and make a mental note of the way you came in - better still take a pic, as all the entrances and exits look the same, especially in the dark2. Keep your belongings close to your chest - there are loads of tourist police everywhere you look but don't let your guard down with your valuables just because you are on holiday. 3. Soak up the experience! Allow the drums to carry you into this world - so different from our own! 4. try some of the street food... It's cheap, and although some may put you off with tales of how unhygienic it is, you should try it (if you are worried, have something vegetable-based). My husband had the best flatbread-filled kebab for about 80p!"

Located in the medina, the square does not have a fixed shape or clearly stated boundaries, it has more or less organic borders that are not visible to the eye until you realize that you have left the square or suddenly appear on it.During the day time it is a fairly busy square that is used for all sorts of activities: from locals crossing the square to quickly get to the other side of the medina to real tourist traps (e.g. dancing monkeys, snakes and the almost unavoidable \"super real\" Rolex sales guys). Every time I crossed the square I had to say \"no\" 35 times or more up to the point that you cannot even have a normal conversation with your travel companion. After two days this really starts to become annoying; in fact the entire medina with its souks is more or less like this. Also beware of seemingly friendly \"guides\" that walk with you without you asking for it; they will surly want a reward for showing you which direction to head for (it is almost inevitable not to fall for this at least once since you can get lost quite easily; make sure you have small change with you for these kind of circumstances; 10DHM is already more then enough although they will beg you to give more, even more so if they have seen the other amounts in your wallet).In short: part of the deal when in Marrakech; go see it for sure. Pick a roof terrace for the occasion and absorb the square (especially in the evening when the square comes to life), but don't buy anything here and also if you have other options don't eat here: you pay a huge premium for dinging close to the square and the food is actually quite average to bad in some occasions."

Came back later in the evening and the circus was just getting started. As a female traveling solo I didn't want to stay till dark, although that's when the fun really begins. If you like snakes (they've removed their teeth), a lot of noise and people this is the place!"

            "review": "Exhilirating culture shock!. This square is a \"must see\" for visitors to Marrakesh. It comes alive at night, with a seething mass of locals and tourists, beggars, traders, snake charmers, henna tattooists, drummers, dancers, musicians, story tellers, donkey carts, motor bikes, horse drawn carriages,you name it! It's tremendous fun just to walk around and absorb the atmosphere, but there are endless food stalls and cafes and orange juice sellers, too, if you're hungry/thirsty. A couple of words of warning: the locals expect to be paid if you take photos of them, especially the traditional water sellers, with their wildly decorated hats and goblets strung round their necks, and the guys with monkeys and the snake charmers. Either snap them from the cafes' roof terraces with a zoom lens, or offer them payment in advance - a few dirhams are usually acceptable. Secondly, if you stop walking, you will immediately be besieged with kids selling tat or begging, and dodgy blokes selling fake watches or weed. They can be v persistent, so a useful phrase is \"La shokran\" which is \"No thanks\" in Arabic. Best to then walk away. Thirdly, it's v easy to get lost in Marrakesh. There are hardly any street signs in the old town medina, and they're in arabic script, so do remember landmarks as you walk. Many locals speak french, if you need to ask for directions, but some may expect to be paid for directing you, and others will give you completely wrong directions with a great air of authority! If you get so lost that you need a taxi back to your hotel, hail one on the street and insist he switches the meter on. The ones parked at taxi ranks are the worst for overcharging.With those few caveats, I found Marrakesh a safe and hugely enjoyable place to wander round. As a 60 year old woman alone with my 25 year old daughter, I'd been a bit worried about safety before going, but we encountered no problems at all. Definitely recommend it for winter sun and great cultural experience!"

I expected the bartering at the market stalls but I was less prepared for the snake charmers and henna tattooists that launched themselves at you at every opportunity - and then the histrionics if you tried to get away without paying for that henna tattoo you never asked for or that photograph you took of someone in all innocence."

In the morning its quite calm with few hawkers selling dates, spices & hammam accessories and a row of orange juice stand. As it gets to evening the place really comes alive. A lot of food stalls open up, including a row just selling ready to eat snails. Performers of music, snake charmer, fortune tellers and dancers can be found all around, storytellers are in abundance although they speak only in Moroccan. The square is popular with locals as well as tourist. Locals crowd up to hear the stories and seem to drink up the superstitious talks. Tourist are mostly crowd watching from one of the many cafes which face the squares with only the braves ones trying the local food stands. Almost all the tourist will be haggled with beggars or sellers of questionable goods (weed/ imitation watches/ iphone/ hammam)."

As per the title, Jamaa el Fna at night is so different than during the day that they can scarcely be considered the same attraction. Personally, I found the night time visit to be much better than the day - I would give the former a 5 and the latter a 3, hence the 4-star review. During the night, the sound and ambiance of the square is something to be experienced at least once in your life. The travel brochures might sound corny and a bit Euro-centric when they say that it \"awakens all your senses\" but the experience is truly amazing, from the street theatre to the fresh juices to the tasty Street food. Prices are very competitive, and although there is a bit of tourist-hassling going on, it is by no means oppressive or even uncomfortable. We finished our tour of the Jamaa with a drink on the terrace of one of the nearby bars, which gave us a great view of the whole proceedings and was a good way to wrap the evening up. Definitely eat inside the square itself and save the bars for drinking! Unfortunately, our trip to the Jamaa the next morning was nothing like our wonderful outing of the night before. Street theatre and music gave way to frankly quite sad displays of snake charming and monkey acrobatics - you get the feeling that these animals, climbing around their minders in chains and wearing nappies, would rather be in their natural habitat in the Atlas mountains. The harassment here did get quite out of hand and you feel that everyone is out to make a buck at your expense - most of the time a firm No (or three) will do the trick but be on the lookout for veiled women grabbing your hand and spraying cheap henna tattoos on it, then charging you an extortionate fee for their poor handiwork. The souks are much more interesting than the square itself, so just quickly walk through on your way there to get an idea of what it's like."

The sheer number of people all trying to get money at any and every opportunity, the incessant harrassment, the pungent smells of the food cooking and the din or people shouting, the 'entertainers' and the snake charmers was totally overwhelming. What stuck with me was the horrifying site of the gorgeous monkeys being dragged around on chains, clearly terrified of their handlers, being thrown at unsuspecting tourists who are then railroaded into having their photos taken and then having to pay for the privilege. It was a very oppressive intimidating place, squalid, filthy, overcrowded and in my opinion best avoided. The poor carriage horses at the entrance across from the Koutoubia Mosque are in generally poor condition, are overworked and I didn't see any fresh water for them. It was very upsetting to me and I hated the place!"

Always be aware of where your bag is securely over your shoulder and in front of you. At times lot of police and plain closed police. Felt sad for the animals but donkeys and horses pulling carriages overall look well fed and in good condition. Snakes getting annoyed by snake charmers to sit up. Monkeys with nappies on. Flute and drum sound echoe through the square. Food in cafes at side of square where locals and tourists eat very good value. 10dm or 15dm for bowl soup, pizza 30-40dm, salads 30dm, tajines, couscous. Lots of lovely food in an amazing location. Cafe Babouch (down street with Marrakechi restaurant at corner of square), super place run by young folk, with young male group (lovely voices) and one of the waiters sings as well. Delicious pizza, pasta as well as local food/try the veggie pastilla and morrocan salad with some mint tea."

The snake charmers can be heard before they are seen as they play there musical instruments and were easy to avoid. The monkeys dressed in clothing were a little more trickier to spot but also avoidable. There were also musicians and dancers in the square.

We have condensed all info regarding marrakech visit for couple with young 15 month old son.Tips and Info for Marrakech Tourists1.Stay in traditional Moroccan Riads and some come with free hamam if you book ahead for 3 nights2. Baby push chair is not a problem to move around.3. Airport to Riad book it through Viator from 7euros to 10 euros, most of the riads charge 18 euros4. But book tours through Riads comparing with viatore as riad deals are usually cheaper and you can have a deal with the same driver if you want to visit anyother place in and around the city5. Moving around at night is not a problem.6.Have a bright smiling face, words like no thanks, may be later, may be tomorrow, and big Harlem style headphones if you don't want hagglers disturbing your shopping.7. Make sure you ask about price before touching any product be it in riad or souk or any shop and this applies to photograph requests with locals/entertainers. Selfie stick is worth an investment and you can get it for 50 dirhams in the square.10 Dhs for photographs. Charity as you please. 8. Make sure your kid doesnt get forced in with any toy or balloon as you may have to pay at the end to the kids selling it.9. First day don't buy but go for window shopping, but DONT buy. Have an idea or make a list of what you like. Second day, go to Ensemble artisanal 5-10Dhs by Taxi or 15 mins walk from square. Good quality products, no bargaining, good for everything including argan oil, perfumes,incense, crafts, decoration stuff, thuya wood box,carpets etc and a lot under one roof. Serious shoppers will spend one day, but minimal shoppers can spend an hour or two. It has two floors. They have chinese stuff as well but buy what you can get only in Morocco. Unfortunately no discounts. Prices may be slightly higher than souk but its worth the time and saves precarious shopping despite bartending.10. Food- Enjoy Jemaa elFnaa food in stalls(Just for an experience). Make sure you decide what you want to eat be it bread, salad,sauce before dipping your finger in as anything can have unusual price and you could avoid extra charges by just saying No thanks I dont want this! Next to definitely try is snail soup, spicy tea with cake and orange juice or orange+grapefruit. Make sure you ask how much if its in a disposable cup. Next, dont have food in McD,KFC,Italian or other western or asian stuff. Eat authentic Moroccan when u have a solid aopportunity in Morocco. Definitely try Mechui. Go to Hadj Mustpha between 11:00- 14:00. Best option is to ask for 500gram meat from portion of your choice with sheep head. This will be 80+80. Make sure you get the quantity what you need and confirm the 500grams and pay before taking the stuff with you as the trick is to tell you after you've had it that it was 800grams and charge you extra. Next, have rabbit tagine in Tiznit 20 steps from Hadj Mustapha. You can also have early sunset dinner at Taj in Darna restaurant facing the square for the photograp with square in the background and good food. Other good places are Naim Food and the street from Jemma elfnaa towards El Badi palacehas very good restaurants for seafood. Just ask the way to el badi or HadjBrek(is another good restaurant that localites frequent to) the seafood restaurants will be on your left.11.Moroccans are good polite and help[ful people except for a few who can misuse tourists for their gain. Beware of intruders who can tell you that there's a tannery here, a auction sale in this street etc, don't pay heed to them. Kaftans- smarine souk, pastries and eatables-ElKassabine souk. Henna can be done in square but not great- expect to pay not more than 50Dhs for two hands even if its light/dark brown with those shiners. They say it can be washed away in 5 mins. My wife left it for 40 mins and it lasted a week.Buy dry fruits, olives and herbs for mint tea in the square. 12. Majorelle garden 40 mins, menara garden- 15 mins, palm grove 40 mins.Bahia palace 40 mins. Badi palace 40 mins. Saadian tombs 15 mins. Thats it!13. Money exchange- best near the square compared to airport. difference of 2Dhs. Airport shopping do accept euros and Dhs. Hope that was helpfulEnjoy Marrakech and see you in the next TravellogNaveed"

Even when you say no and trying to pull away, they hold it so tight and won't take no for an answer.Also be careful with people following you around pretending to be your guide, and again expecting you to pay them even when you don't require their service.

My wife hit the sack whilst I had a walk to the The Jemaa el-Fnaa, which is one of the best-known squares in Africa and is the centre of city activity and trade. At sun down it turns into a huge multi stall restaurant, market and street theatre with snake charmers, henna tattooists and shady looking arabs who will throw a monkey on your back and demand money if you're not vigilant. Beware of pickpockets as its very dark in places. If you choose to eat, make sure it's busy with the locals and not just tourists, this will insure it's of decent quality and safe. We ate the snails for two nights running and used stall Number 5 on both occasions as the cooking sauce was nice and peppery. Tried quite a few Orange Juice sellers, the best we found was Stall 40, well worth the 4 Dirhams a glass, so refreshing. I recommend trying the Blood Orange too, you can feel the goodness as you drink it.Bartering is a way of life, whether you love it or loathe it, you can't get away from it in Morocco. Many reviews suggest offering a quarter and settle for half; when I have done it this way I always felt a bit ripped off! I do it different as I spent some time in India. Offer a quarter of the asking price with a smile on your face and settle for a third of the price, many will refuse, so just walk away; they will either follow you and come to some agreement, or remember you the next time you walk passed. The nearest shop to the Riad El Farah, is run by a friendly Berber lady also called Fatima, she's really lovely. I had my eye on one of her Berber hats and my wife on a real leather handbag. We knew they were quoting the bag at 700 Dirhams at the leather/tannery market. Fatima gave us the initial price on our first day of 400D. My wife is useless at bartering, so I went in with an offer of 100D, each day we walked past Fatima slowly brought the price down to 250D. On the final day I went out on my own to do some last minute shopping, went to Fatima's, with a raised offer of 150D for the bag, she then came down to 200D, I smiled and picked up the Berber hat I had my eye on, threw it on top of the bag and said final offer 200D for the two; Fatima snapped my hand off, we both laughed and hugged each other. It was so much fun, so always barter with a smile on your face..."

It was an onslaught to the senses to visit this market in Marrakech. Mix of cultures, food, spices, smells - exotic in every way! Snake charmers, witch doctors and fire eaters and food sellers. Even more fun at night. All the weirdest things you could imagine to find in Northern Africa compressed into one small market square. Experience never to forget. Truly awesome. Watch your pockets though!"

            "review": "A very intense experience. The central square, and social hub, of Marrakech is a bit of a must-see, and it's certainly a real experience, but personally I was quite relieved to get the experience out of the way.In some respects, it's amazing: thousands of people throng the square and give the place a permanent festival atmosphere. There are snake charmers, and musicians sitting with listeners on little tables, and loads of unofficial street vendors ducking the police. It's rammed with everyone who lives there or ever wanted to visit.The downside is that if you look like a tourist at all, you will be constantly beset by people who want you to give them money. One woman wrenched my hand out of my pocket so that she could force me to accept a henna tattoo. People follow you around, you get accosted every few feet by people asking if you're lost/want to eat/want to buy a thing. The result has been that we've found ourselves marching purposefully even if we are completely lost, because at least that way we won't get hassled.In my home city of Glasgow, if someone notices you're lost and asks if they can help, it's because they want to help. In Marrakech, it always seems to be because they want money. That's caused a bit of a culture shock.The animals, too, can be upsetting if you're at all squeamish about that sort of thing. There are Barbary apes wearing nappies, or sometimes silly outfits with sunglasses, or locked in tiny boxes; horses waiting in line for hours on end, attached to carriages, with no access to water or food or just the chance to not be tied up; even the snakes look unhappy. It's difficult to watch if you're used to quite strict animal rights laws.The most fun we've had in the square has been when we've been sitting up on one of the terraced restaurants, drinking coffee and watching it all unfold below us."

So on the first night of our trip after being subtly cajoled by a self-proclaimed guide who found us and took two lost looking tourists to a supposedly authentic Moroccan restaurant which was clearly overpriced and allowed him to receive a cut. Once he realised that he was not going to gently manipulate any more money out of us, we were left alone. We wondered along the darkened streets and souks and found our way to the Jemaa el Fna. It was frenzied, busy, hectic, with a mass of people as it transitioned from stall holders to night-time entertainers.People thronged everywhere, you were constantly be heckled to buy something and there was a mass of people and activity, which left you somewhat overwhelmed and confused in the organised chaos.Wearing walking shoes is a must and on a different day, say day 2 or 3 of your break, the square might have been easier to engage with."

To be in the square when the call to prayer resounds from all sides ( lots of minarets) is truly awesome. Survival tips?

Yes it is a must visit given its history but I wouldn't linger after some photos. 1. First was in the evening. Looking for dinner. Sat down at stall 95. It looked busy with locals and tourists. We ordered one tagine with meat, one tagine with figs and two soft drinks. They brought olives, two portions of salads (which we didn't order) but fine, didn't mind that, knowing we needed to pay. Then the tagines came. One was lamb with figs and the other was beef with prunes which the waiter said was 'meat came with prunes'. It wasn't exactly what we ordered but after trying to clarify the waiter said that is what we wanted. Tagines tasted ok but was extremely oily (not the best meet quality) and small portions. So in the end we got charged double for the tagines when we asked for the bill. Including the side dishes we didn't order. It came to 250 Dh between the two of us. We may as well have went to a restaurant!2. Went to one of the many juice stalls in the market in the middle of the afternoon. The sign clearly states 4 Dh for a cup of orange juice. The seller first asked us to taste a smallsample of the mixed juice (a cup priced at 10 Dh). We had the taste but still wanted the orange juice only. He used the plastic cup we used for the tasting, filled it with orange juice, and handed over money. When we got the change back, he had charged me 40 Dh instead of 4 Dh, claiming that he had to sell me the plastic cup and hence the extra cost...!!!! We refused and insisted on him giving us back the money, only to have his attention when we mentioned the word 'police'. By the way he took back the cup of juice, and the cup was used already for tasting. Don't think he would be throwing the juice away..."

When I went there I loved it because they had so much variety of clothing, food, toys, etc. It was like a never ending circle. At night they do mini shows in the middle of the markets for entertainment; snake charmers, dancers, singers, magician and so many other types of entertainment. Would reccomend to go at night."

What an amazing place this is, it was like going back in time: musicians, dancers, story-tellers, snake charmers, gamblers betting on (rigged?) boxing matches (!), henna tattooists, vendors selling everything from cigarettes to handkerchiefs to kitchen utensils to cakes, breads and sweets. An area set aside for colourful traditional carts selling only freshly squeezed fruit juices that were delicious. There was a huge selection of food stalls selling all kinds of traditional foods, one specifically just selling mint tea and traditional broth served by a chap who was the spit of Chris Kamara (you might have to be an English football fan for this one). The food stall and street vendors calling out to attract trade, the musicians playing guitars, drums and finger cymbals, the cheers of the crowds being entertained all blended into one. Don't miss the pitch and put man - a golf club and ball, green felt mat, raised hole at one end, great fun! For the best and most popular attraction by far - look for the crowd of people in a large circle holding long poles with string tied to the end with a ring dangling on the bottom of it, trying to hook the ring over the neck of various fizzy drinks bottles with looks of total concentration - totally addictive!"

Our first visit was early afternoon and it was busy but still very chilled. Lots of small stalls selling fresh juice, and quick traditional moroccon food. I must warn all that there are shop owners who will try to scam you!! A lady on henna stall called us over and asked about mine and my partners tattoos, she then grabbed my hand and started doodling away saying it was free (I didnt have much choice in the matter! I really didnt want it done!) I tried to give her 20dh tip and then she tried to charge me 300dh! We got away with 50dh! The henna she used was also bad, my hand went really read as well as painful! Many shop owners are like this but we've learnt if you stand your ground and move on you can avoid this and police are never too far if you need help! Shop owners do try to drag you into their stalls. Other then that the medina is wonderful place full of wonders! Make sure you also visit in the evening and have lunch on a roof top restaurant, thats when the place really comes alive!!"

Remember how to get back to your riad as once you get turned around everything looks the same! Food vendors are safe, clean and cheap so eat in the square.

            "review": "a menagerie of humanity, animals, culture, and haggling!!. The heart of the city!! It is in your face with colors, smells, a zest pool of cultures and countries all making for an unforgettable recipe. I am going to give you my tips and thought about this place. My first suggestion for where to stay would be at the Palais sabban. The hotel was a palace at one point an due to this it has a lot of ground to cover. Never the less it is traditional moroccan design. The room are unique and charming. there is a huge courtyard with a pool and amazing flower shrubs and trees. there is also a courtyard in the top, now there are no great panoramas, but many of the hotel in the area did not have any as there are no building higher than three floors. if you go to the website the photos do not do them any justice. We only stayed here for a night because we put a lot of weight on the photos, but man was I sad when we left, not only because of the palaces beauty, but because the food was amazing, and there alcoholic drinks were incredible as well as there food. I recommend the lamb tajine!! another great hotel is riad wow. the location is just as good. the service was great, breakfast was the best we had. The decor is modern morocco and did not quite have the charm of the previous. However this place was still top notch. The drinks left me wanting and expensive!! Now, remember than morocco is a muslim country and the only place you will see alcohol served everywhere. Okay, back to the Souk. We spend about 5 days touring the souk and even that was not enough time. We would be out for 5 to 8 hours at a time and even that was not enough time to see the whole place. The souk streets are amaze that intertwine back and forth and i believe local get a kick out of lost tourist scamping wildly thought the streets. so keep this in mind and give your self lot of time to explore. shopping and the souk require patience, and haggling. My advise to not buy at first sight, but compare prices with other vendors, but keep in my that is you think you'll find that shop the next day your more than likely will not find it again. There was a shop we wanted to return, but could not find again. The big seller is souks are the carpets and these can fetch astronomical prices, the king of souvenirs!! The leather is amazing, and not too badly priced. There was a shop that i found that the gentleman had his shop in the back so there was no middle men and his prices where amazing!! and the product excellent, once again i can not tell you where it is located cause i never found it again. just remember not all products are of the same quality so inspect them.The square itself. At night it is full of food vendors and tourist. try the orange juices while your there. It is the most amazing tasting and one of the cheapest thing to buys, about $1 for incredible taste and freshness. The US could only dream of having such quality!! Beware of the snakes charmer!!! Please be warn that these guys will approach you with a huge smile on their face and be uber friendly. When you ask them how much it will cost to have a photo taken they will answer \"don't worry, small price\" not that i believed them, but I figure what is the most that they can ask out of me, maybe $5 to 10 dollars, so I, even you might take the chance. After snapping several photos they tell you the price, which is between $25 to $50!!! and they will gang up on you and haggle you. Luckily, I only has 20 dirham, $2, on me at that point. so they vexed about this and i told them that i could erase the photo and at this point the took my $2 dollars disgusted. Now, I was not the only one that this happened to. I witnessed as these guys did this to another tourist and the same scenario as mine played out, except the guys had to borrow money from his buddies to pay them off. Be ware of people giving you \"free samples\" most of the time this involves food. once you bite it they will shake you down for money. Now with all this you would think that there is lots of crime and theft, but you could not be more wrong!! This morocco was one of the safest places i have traveled in and the square is the same. I would walk after dark, around 10 at night, with my camera equipment and feel at easy. There are police everywhere and guard and as much as the vendors try to extract crazy amount of money from you they provide for a safe environment.now, when it come to bargaining the only thing that I can tell you is that you should not accept the first price ever. cabs, try to agree on a price before you get on. At places that have set prices try to haggle it is part of the culture and you'll usually get it about 25% cheaper.now is you are in a large group tour and you have a guide and you go into a \"co operative\" let it be know that that you guide get a cut of the sale, so there for the vendor will care you more for that a item. So if you have time in marrakech it is better to come back by yourself and you get a better price. Now if that is the only evening you have at that location than use you judgment. I am not sure how much of a cut they get, but I heard that even official tour guides get a cut. Now if you take a guides tour thought your hotel they will charge you a lot more. Our official guide in Fez was only $15 and he was amazing, and his english was second to none. He had also being Ronald regan guide in the 80's. So my time in marrakech was great. i have a great time at Jemaa el fna, but I was glad to move on. The souk will try you patience and good will, but I am glad to have done it. hope this helps someone!"

The dishes and cutlery are washed in a bath on the premises!Other restaurants are around the square; some accessed by two flights of stairs ( no handrail nor disabled access). Assertive 'Touts' vie for business to the restaurants and shops.Groups of 'Berbers' local folk in Berber costume, sit in circles with their musical instruments and invite you to sit and listen. A small donation is appreciated. The Square in daytime, is minus the food stalls, but has stalls selling fruit, dates, figs, fruit drinks. Vendors 'on the hoof' sell mobile 'phones, watches, toys. Cafe, Le Classico, is good for snacks at reasonable prices.Adjacent to the square are the horse drawn carriages available for hire. The brasses are well polished and the horses in good condition."

There are stalls and vendors on the square all day, but it is the evening when the place really livens up, with the food stalls popping up and the musicians really getting into their stride. However, I think if you removed the food stalls, juice stalls, henna ladies and people selling argan oil, there would be very little left - just a couple of snake charmers, photo-op people with monkeys or traditionally dress water carriers, the odd troupe of acrobats, few musicians, few vendors of pottery nik-naks and metal tea lights and that's about it.Seems quite popular with locals as well as tourists though and I guess if you're in Marrakesh, you have to visit the square at least once. There are lots of cafes and restaurants around the square, some with terraces, so you can view the square whilst dining. Felt safe and at ease, but ladies, don't allow any of the henna ladies to get hold of your hand, unless you want to have a henna tattoo and are willing to haggle a price for their service - I gather they can be quite aggressive and unpleasant to deal with, but have no direct experience in this area.To me, the souks are much more interesting and offer a great deal more."

I would recommend Cafe France or L'ancien Cafe. The square is the hub of Marrakech, where traders sell their wares and food from stalls. Based on reviews, we decided not to eat at any stalls as some of them are not hygienic. As with every tourist spot in Marrakech, you will be bothered by people and traders who see Western tourists as easy pickings to sell things to. If you relax and accept the culture difference, you will normally find that a smile and a polite \"la shukran\" (no thanks) is enough, but with others, it is necessary to be slightly firmer - however, do keep in mind that the tradition of trade is so established in this culture that the people can seem pushy and sometimes even rude. It is the unfortunate consequence of tourism that you will hear things like \"Cheap as chips\" and \"That's Asda price!\". If you do want to buy something from the traders in the square - as you'll know from the first research of Marrakech - the initial price is hugely inflated. Bartering is a way of life here and prices are only rarely displayed for small souvenirs. There are government owned shops for those who aren't confident in their haggling abilities. The two we found are called Centre de Artisanals and one can be found across from the Cyberpark on Mohammed V ave - the other is at the bottom of Rue de Kasbah across from the souk there. You cannot avoid Jemaa el Fna, so try and enjoy the experience."

Sit, enjoy coffee, absorb the atmosphere and then later brave the chaos.At night the square changes entirely, but do eat here. If worried, choose food that's well cooked and eat like a local.Before we travelled, we had read up on the square and were well prepared to be pestered. Thankfully things have improved. Just bear in mind that a lot of the people make their money from the pictures you take of them. Be respectful. Set your price, do not budge and you'll be good.One last thing, local guides a really worth it.

It also helps when eating out in restaurants later because you may then recognize some of the dishes. The Square looks like organized chaos when you enter it and it is! but don't worry about the constant calls from the various stall holders to come and eat at their particular stall - just take a 'browse' up and down the rows first and then decide.

Be aware you do get hassled but they are only trying to make a living. Have fun , be polite, tell then maybe later , maybe much later , they will laugh with you, your not the first person to walk buy, enjoy it, take it in. I was offered a lovely Morrocan tea set for 150 mad , so I'm going back for a couple at 70 mad each . The passages are vast, and we got seriously lost, we decided at this point to sit down and eat , just a lite snack and to refresh , my beef tagine with prunes and apricots was delicious . Salad , tagine , olives , bread , Coke , and sliced oranges with cinnamon and sugar , oh! And mint tea for two people came to just 130 mad ( appx \u00a39 ) really !!!!! .

After being told how to get back to the main square and after a lovely horse and cart ride ( I happily agreed 100 mad , probably could of bartered him down but hey \u263a\ufe0f) back to the hotel we returned that evening before our restaurant reservation at Le Strass ( see review ). The evening at the square was so different , I had realised that food sellers would be there then but not to this extent , OMG.

A little girl was selling what looked like macaroons for just 1 mad each , I tried one , they taste lovely , I bought 4 , she was very happy and she was over the moon when I gave her 20 mad , smiled at her and told her to keep it . Definitely taking a box of 20 or 30 of those home . The orange juice sellers offer fresh juice at 4 mad but make sure you tell them you want 4 mad orange juice otherwise you get mixed juice at 10 mad.

After this experience, we just stayed away from the middle of the square and walked around it. Negotiating for prices is also something to always keep in mind because they do try to sell items for ridiculous prices."

We went out of season so it was quite possibly a bit quieter than normal but still a good atmosphere with the usual snake charmers etc, Top tios, the orange juice is a bargain at 4dirham and very tasty. Steer clear of the monkeys and snakes etc if you don't want to be approached, you can get good pictures from the roof top cafes with a zoom. Ladies keep your hands in your pockets when near the henna tattoo ladies if you don't want to risk an unwanted tattoo.. heard a story of one lady trying to ask for 600dirham for one so if you get one agree the price (in writing) in advance. We did eat at one of the street stalls in the centre, stuck to the grilled skewers but be careful a/they will put food infront of you and if you accept it you get charged, if they try and give you something extra that you don't want then give it back and b/ check your bill.. even if they add it up on paper infront of you, ours tried to charge 495 dirham which I knew was wrong, as soon as I questioned it and asked for a menu to add it up myself they left me to it and just accepted what I said it should be! 270 dirham !

There are snake charmers and monkey tamers in the square - none of which appealed to me, I think it's plain cruel. The poor snakes looked lifeless and monkeys are chained around the necks which are constantly getting pulled by their handlers. Also beware of the women applying henna, negotiate prices first else they will just grab your hand and start to apply.The shopkeepers too, will try charging extortionate amounts for items which can cost a lot less in Rahba Kedima (always remember to haggle wherever you go). To be honest, I think Jemma el Fna is only good for cheap street food (stalls opened in evenings) and drinks. There are many stalls selling fresh fruit juices costing only 4dhs. As I'd mentioned earlier, Rahba Kedima square is a lot cheaper for purchasing souvenirs. It seemed to be the place where the locals did their grocery shop as well - there were plenty of spice markets around and fruit and veg stalls. Madressa Ben Youssef is also in the same area which is worth taking a look at. It is inevitable that you will get lost within the souk, the signposts aren't particularly helpful so you will just have to have a bit of a walk around to get out. Be prepared to get gawped at by the men too.The alleys are narrow and scooters are always riding past, as well as donkey drawn carts so do be careful! "

If you are looking for an in your face market experience with a touch of animal cruelty you will find it. If you are, however, looking for a quiet coffee and a panoramic view of the madness you can find that too. It is very much a place to choose your own adventure. I would suggest a few quiet beers at Cafe Arabe before diving into the food markets in the evening. You can find an absolute throng of food stalls at night serviced by boisterous individuals who have a rehearsed and at times hilarious patter. My highlight would have to have been \"mushy bloody peas\". It is all a little same same but different but if you can find the courage it is well worth it. The atmosphere alone is worth the cheap price of the Moroccan style tapas. I would suggest that you keep an eye and maybe both hands on your personal belongings if you intend to immerse yourself in the crowds. Allegedly pick pockets are rife within the square at night but we seem to have gotten away unscathed so far (unless you take buying trinkets in the souks into consideration). I can see how the square would not be everybody's cup of sweet mint tea but it is a fascinating place to visit."

I'd go further away from the main square to get better deals though. When you're there watch out for people putting monkeys on you and snake charmers. Also, I wouldn't recommend getting henna done there either. My husband decided he wanted to take a photo with 2 cobras (he was in the background but he angled it so it looked like he was close to them). One of the guys grabbed his phone and took a few photos. My husband gave the man equivalent to $5 but he demanded $20. We weren't giving them another dime so hubby snatched the phone back and we got out of there.It's definitely an interesting experience. My advice is to go to one of the rooftop cafes surrounding the square, grab a soft drink or tea (they make you buy something of course but don't expect to pay more than $2-4), and enjoy the view from a distance."

The grilled food is outstanding at night, and the orange juice definitely worth a try during the day. At all times of day and night the square is well worth a stroll. Despite my 5-star review of the square itself, I'd recommend sticking to the grilled lamb and avoiding the chicken. On our last visit, a group of us came away with two kinds of food poisoning from lukewarm chicken - the only time in my life I've been poisoned and I've eaten in all kinds of dodgy places!"

Everywhere you go you'll be approached by people asking for money or trying to sell you things. Get into the mood and soak up the electricity in the air. Sample spectacular foods at the carts, or sit in a cafe and watch people go by. You'll be amazed at what you can see. Remember the word \"Balak\" - or \"look out\" (usually called by someone trying to pass you on wheels)."

Well...Your taxi drops you off (after standard argument on pre-arranged price). You walk through a patch of land absolutely reeking of horse urine and feces, as someone tries to sell you a horse carriage ride that you really don't want. You walk further to see 20 plus identical orange juice stalls trying to sell you orange juice. You trip over a man with snakes (charming.. not) - and almost get bitten by a very tired and angry monkey being dragged along on a chain. A man in a wheel chair with the majority of his limbs missing \"asks\" for money.You feel you are in the constant company of crooks, thieves, cheats and failed circus performers. It's dark and you feel not entirely comfortable.Then you finally reach some food stalls where a man says..and I quote \"I guarantee my food won't give you diarrhea\". You can then head into a shopping area where no doubt the hassle level increases further.I think I either missed the point of this \"attraction\" - or civilization has moved on.Now hold your breath as you walk back passed the urine drenched horse stands...."

If you are eating at one of the stalls, you have to watch out for anything MIXED as they will inflate the prices, charging each of the items separately.

They are quite happy for you to sit with a pot of Mint Tea! (many drank!)During the day you can experience the snake charmers, Henna Tattooists, the 'poor' little monkeys, musicians & bell ringers brightly dressed waiting to snare you for a price!!! But what an experience! IN addition at night the story tellers and magicians come out, to stand among the crowd and to listen is fascinating even although you don't understand a word they say! But the expressions make it an experience! Rows and Rows of every type of food - with long trestle tables and benches, you have to be pretty agile on occasion to squeeze in!Not just a tourist attraction because you can find yourself on a bench and every person in the place other than you is Moroccan!The transformation which takes place at dusk is amazing, day time you can buy virtually anything, but masses of stalls squeezing oranges into a glass in front of you, to the many other other Moroccan and African attractions - and the lights!!!!! these still all remain in place, as an army of all ages set up eating stalls! An amazing sight! You can buy from the very cheap to relatively expensive! My favourite for many years standing is my Bowl of Soup... still only 3 dirhams, which is less than 20p(sterling)!!! There is a lot of haranguing due to pressure to have you visit their stall and can be more than a little daunting. As for the sweets that get pushed around on carts....!!!

Sadly, our visit to the square has left us with a bad taste in our mouths. Having travelled through the Atlas Mountains and staying in various traditional towns and villages throughout the south of Morocco, this square is in no way typical of the country. The smell from the area containing the horses and carts is atrocious, rubbish can be seen in piles and as for the \"entertainment\", well I'd rather eat my own eye balls than spend any time there. EVERYONE wants money. Be carful where you point your camera as some plucky lad will accuse you of taking his picture and demand money. Even asking for directions will cost you money. As an extensive traveller, I have found that most locals are more than happy to help tourists without feeling the need to rip them off. I certainly would cross the street to help a tourist when I'm at home. The stalls are selling tacky, mass-produced items for above average sums of money. I can't comment on the food served on the stalls as we did not eat there but can you see any fresh running tap water? We have spoken to people who have had very bad tummies after eating at a stall so we chose to avoid. If you approach the food area, you will find yourself being shouted at by all the \"waiters\", trying to coax you in. They are more than persistent and even become hostile when you politely decline.You will be deafened by musical groups who are appalling.Finally, the treatment of the monkeys and the snakes was the final nail in the coffin for us. We were appalled to see the monkeys dressed in human clothes and sunglasses and being dragged around by metal chains. As if this isn't bad enough, they were surrounded by European tourists who actually paid to have their photos taken with these poor creatures. As other TA's have posted, please ignore these horrid, cruel individuals.....you are only encouraging their behaviour.I know we are in the minority as most people posting appear to find this place to be fun, entertaining and a \"must see\". Please, if nothing else, think about the animals."

She got 3 choices : orange, brown or black. Orange lasts a few days, brown a week, black more than 2 weeks. So she went for black. It was done within 5 minutes, dried for sevral hours and..........dissapeared completely after 3 days. There were guys playing intruments making a snake angry and few people with pitiful monkeys. Prices of fruits were 3 times more expensive than ''down the road''. So all in all : not impressed at all."

Beware the gangs of women pedaling henna tatoos - Black Henna is common and my companion despite protesting that she did not want one was given one anyway \"for free\" on completion the woman demanded 500 dirhums for 5 minutes work. We refused and paid 100. The henna she used has now left serious scarring on my partners hands. AVOID them. The food stalls in the square itself seem to have hygiene standards well below par to be serving cooked meats and meals.

At night the square comes alive with souvenir vendors, orange juice carts, food stands, and entertainment from all over Morocco. Be prepared to give tips if you want to take pictures or video, so have change with you. The wide varieties of music is enchanting as well as the story tellers, snake charmers, and playful monkeys. It does become very crowded as this seems to be the place that everyone in Marrakech goes at night, but well worth the visit to really get a magical experience."

The sight and sound is like nothing most of us get to experience and everyone should visit at least once. As always, it's important to stay vigilant in crowds but I never felt unsafe. The key is to be firm: don't let the women doing henna grab your hand without your consent. Also don't take unauthorised pictures of people with things like snakes and money's (no idea why anyone would want to in the first place) but they will demand payment if you do. But the atmosphere is second to none and needs to be experienced at least once in a lifetime!"

Also, keep your handbag or other within sight and ensure you have your valuables well protected as there are many young kids on the prowl.At dusk the square comes alve with foodstalls setting up and offerings traditional moroccan dishes, including vegetarian, fish and meat. The food is prepared in front of you so it is not for the faint-hearted!Snake charmers, gift sellers, acrobats and dance troupes can all be found there at night....enjoy!"

It's an amazing, magical place. It has its own vibrancy, its own life. Not sure the locals are aware of the jewel they have there. It's just amazing. I want to start by saying that we never got lost, even though we wandered the narrow streets of the Medina and checked every little souk. It's spider-web-shaped, so wherever you go, you'll end up in the main square at some point. No guide, it was just me and my husband. Never felt unsafe, but I respected their privacy, didn't take pictures, tried not to make eye contact, ignored the aggressive vendors and just enjoyed the experience. It wasn't as bad as people described it, sellers in our markets back home are sometimes similar to those in Marrakech, so nothing new for me. Avoid the place where they park the carriages, the horse smell is unbearable in day heat. We went to Morocco in September and it was hot. My husband was a bit overprotective and was always on guard but, to be honest, there's nothing to worry about. Have some common sense and, as long as you respect their privacy and culture, nothing bad will happen.You can mingle but never be under the impression that you'll go unseen, that's an illusion. They know you're a tourist from miles away and will always try to rip you off. Keep your wits, be polite, walk away and be firm if you're not interested in what they're offering or just buy what you like. Enjoy the main square, it's an experience I'll never forget!!!!"

The food market at night, though, is a definite must and lots of fun deciding on a table to sit at. I would personally not support the snake or monkey handlers. The monkeys are badly abused and the snakes are barely alive."

The events at night are very amateurish and really do not a look. During the day there are snake charmers but if you dare to take a photo they will pounce on you looking for money. The entrance to the square from the main road is where the horse and carriages line up. There must be over 100 of these and the smell of horse droppings is sickening. Overall I was please I visited but is not a place I would rush back to. Where as the souks and medinas that surround the square are bustling and definitely worth a visit."

By day, it is a busy square with souks leading off and various stalls. By night, it is a seething, joyful mass of people. Snake charmers, monkeys, male dancers dressed as women, musicians, comedy acts (largely meaningless if you are not a local) food stalls and the all-pervading smoke from stoves filling the night air. The throbbing music and insistent rhythm of the pounding drums are mesmerising. Apart from the snakes themselves (??looked like hooded cobras - but probably harmless - their owners handled them without bother!!) there is another serpent to contend with - the pick-pockets. Unfortunately, we had a camera stolen while there. With so many people pushing and bumping into you, it is a paradise for the forty thieves. So, carry the minimum amount of cash for your outing and keep a very firm hand on any valuables. But even so, do not be nervous about going there - Jemaa does not feel personally threatening."

Definitely over priced for the tourist - best is to go from shop to shop and bargain! Also - if you like something in Jemaa el Fna - see if you are able to go out in the city and get those goods (or inner medina perhaps). A tea pot set with glasses & tray, which we couldn't get for lower than 900 dh in Jemaa el Fna - we were able to get in inner medina for less than 200 dirhams. Just bargain! It's fun. We went in mid November, so was definitely a bit chilly after sunset - so have a light jacket or sweater with you. Also, do try the sugarcane juice - it is so good & refreshing! Cant exactly remember the name of the place, but it's in the alley where there are many shwarma restaurants."

I went once before in 2007, but I guess I was too young to remember how horrible it was. I was so excited to be there sitting by the stalls, smelling good food, sampling different options, sipping tea, enjoying the beautiful lights and colours... It's a different reality though. As soon as you set foot in the square, be prepared to be harassed by anyone within 5 meters of you. The hustlers just cannot let you pass without annoying you with their products or restaurant menus. They do not take no for an answer and I can assure you, after the 5th time (make that a few meters), it becomes VERY VERY ANNOYING. The first day, you have patience and you keep saying no politely. But it does not get any better, and I had to devise methods of not being harassed by looking down and avoiding eye-contact. Some people can make you very angry as well by blocking your way and then having a laugh when they succeeded in ruining your day. This has been a general experience in Marrakech. Now to come to the square itself, during the day, snake charmers, monkey owners (dirty!) and women who apply henna will harass you the moment you make eye-contact with them. Do not take any pictures, unless you are from very far away! At night, the whole square becomes bustling with light, people and stalls selling food, most of them having the same thing; there are 3 kinds of stalls: all the mixed meats, lamb head and harira soup. They are all pretty much the same. Word of advice, make sure you add your bill before they tell you the total, as my stall tried to overcharge me 60dhs (that's another 2 meals!!). And the stale bread you have when you sit down, is not free; make sure you want it or else you'll pay 20dhs for stale bread. Prices are very hot as well; 70dhs for a seafood platter to sit on a wooden stool, when 70dhs can get you a 4-star restaurant meal! As much as I wanted to be there and enjoy this place, the stereotyping (not to say racist) hustlers just ruined every time I went there."

Here's a word of advice, you really need to get the people who frequently deal with tourists under control if you're going to want visitors to keep coming back. They really prey on tourists here, for sure, so you really need to #1 be prepared to be harassed by the most aggressive sales people that you'll ever meet. #2, be aware of your surroundings at all times to make sure you're not going to be taken advantage of. #3, know how to, and be prepared to say NO, no matter how aggressive the vendors are. As I stated earlier the folks in the square were overly aggressive, and really made the experience generally unpleasant. Unsolicited, we were approached by a guy with a monkey, who basically threw his monkey on the back of my wife, who did NOT enjoy it. Of course, everyone expects to get paid for every little thing if you take any pictures, so we politely declined to take any pics and went on our way. A few seconds later, we were aggressively approached by a henna tattoo artist, and despite telling her multiple times we weren't interested (she was fluent in English), she basically threw some henna ink onto my wife's hand, and left a stain. Really? Was that necessary? Do you think that's going to make us come back? There are a bunch of snake \"charmers\" in the square as well, so as we were leaving, we were approached by a guy trying to sell us merchandise again, so we politely declined. Then he reached into his bag to pull out a rubber snake for sale which scared the crap out of me! I'm not that afraid of snakes, but we had just walked by about 10 cobras, and that rubber snake was life like! No thank you!!!Anyway, we don't plan on coming back to Morocco after this experience unless significant changes are made. Here's another piece of advice, have the folks in the marketplace post SOME prices, and start hanging price tags on the merchandise like every other civilized country. The sales people in the marketplace could literally charge ANYTHING they want, and get away with it with uneducated tourists. Luckily we had done our research and knew what was a fair price, but having to haggle over EVERY purchase is tiresome, and honestly just made me want to leave sooner than we should have, and made the whole experience not as enjoyable. We had plans to spend 2-3 days shopping here and at the various souks in the Medina area, but once was enough, and we didn't really want to come back. I'm giving this 2 stars just because, yes, it was a unique experience, and something you have to do when you visit Marrakech - but anytime you have a generally unpleasant experience, and don't want to come back, warrants a 2 star review, at best."

It's like going to the circus except you get to walk around in the three rings where the show goes on and on. Acrobats, drummers, stands with delicious orange juice for 40 US cents, snake charmers, hucksters, food at every turn, cafes to sit in when you need a break and from which you can continue to watch the show at a slight remove from the action. Then there are all the twisted alleys of the souk, taking you by shop after shop with everything you might need and many things you don't: shoes and leather goods, copperware, silver, more shoes, olives, slow-roasted lamb, djellabas, cotton shirts, fabric, souvenirs, and more. Be ready to bargain, and you probably shouldn't ask about things you don't intend to buy, but other than that, it's the free market in action. Beware those Invisible Hands!"

We still marvelled at the vivid life each visit we made, enjoyed the fresh juice, got asked our country of origin many times, got called blondie a few times, almost man-handled into a carpet shop, cursed by a little girl when the waiter chased her away, and generally just tried to stroll and take it all in.

Alongside more stalls and shops, you now encounter snake charmers, henna tattooists, musicians and other street entertainers. Still some risk of being run over by motor bikes, but much fewer than in the medina, and easier to dodge in a wide space. Wonderful stalls selling fresh fruit juice are everywhere. The square provides loads of caf\u00e9s and restaurants for all tastes and budgets. Lots of waiters trying to get you into theirs, but not such aggressive hard sell as in the medina. When eating in outdoor caf\u00e9s you do get irritating interruptions from sellers and baggers that are allowed to wander in and hassle you. The square is busy in the day time, but really comes to life after dark, when more entertainers appear, and extra people pop up to sell stuff just from a box or sheet on the ground. If you want a quieter experience, I found there was a brief lull around dusk between day and night visitor traffic."

Other tips:- Make some shopping and remember to always ask for a lower price.- Eat there thamaras and damascus - Drink the mint tea and one orange juice- For a photo with the monkeys I payed (10 dirham)."

The night prior, I was dropped off by a family I had been visiting outside of Marrakech, and an employee of the Riad I was staying it came to meet me there to show me back to my accommodation. Even with a local family by my side, I was immediately swallowed into this insane whirlwind of people constantly approaching with toys, snakes, offers for henna, men dressed in traditional Berber outfits, and guys just flat out asking for money. The next day on my own without the shadow of the family covering me, it was 100x worse. People got physical- men demanding money from me, refusing to stop following me. A younger kid grabbing my canvas tote bag, a guy thrusting a snake in my face and refusing to leave me alone after I said no thank you several times. The men are VERY grabby with women who are alone- there seems to be no public consideration or rule of respect. I met up with a make traveler there and walked through with him- he was physically assaulted by 3 me demanding 200 Dirhams for taking a picture of the square, which they claim they were in. The place is total insanity. The only reason I'd ever recommend it is for the orange juice & the nice guy selling it @ cart #18"

Smells and sounds are exotic and pleasant. Watch and see, preferably from the safely of a roof top restaurant. Most do not do alcohol so check first if you need a drink. The canteens in the market are clean and fun but expect to pay normal restaurant prices. We ate for just under \u00a320 per head and had a bit of everything mezza style. Not sure it was a good idea but chance to try stuff out."

To see the snake charmers, fortune tellers, henna artists. All the food venders from cooked food, fruit juice, many stalls selling snail soup where the broth is supposed to help with a cold. Everyone is looking for a tip from the tourists. You can't watch the snake charmer without giving them a few coins. But you don't feel hustled. The one thing I hated to see were the monkeys on chains and the horse carriages for the tourists. You can see the animals are not well cared for and its a cruel way for them to live. If the Moroccan government cleaned that up the square would be perfect."

The square comes alive in the early evening with snake charmers, monkey's, henna tatto, and lots of things on sale. there ar lots of food stalls to choose from or if you prefer you can find a restaurant around the square.The square is very busy so take care with bags and cameras. The people are poor and see tourists as rich with lots of money to spend. Most of the people are really nice and helpful. However beware of the women walking around the square doing Henna tatoos. They walk towards you and start the tattoo without asking and then they demand 300 diram for the pleasure! Other than that we had a great time. Take care not to photograph people as they will charge you."

I was fortunate enough to visit many other Moroccan cities before I came to Marrakech which gave me a wonderful impression of Morocco before I came to this hell hole.This square is a tourist trap. There are men there with monkeys with metal collars round their necks that they drag about for photo opportunities with tourists. There's snakes on the floor that are more drugged than charmed and the souk people are forceful and aggressive. They walk in after you to try and stop you getting out and at one point a very aggressive stall holder had hold of my wrist trying to stop me from leaving.I am quite a strong willed woman, unphased by pushy sales people but I found this pretty intimidating.The entrance to the square is lined with malnourished horses pulling carts and most of them look as though they have conjunctivitis and they are all twitching.The food in the square is apparently nice but any food on show is covered in flies. I will definitely return to Morocco but will avoid this square at all costs."

The downside is that if you point a camera at anything you will be hassled for payment - the usual sum being 100 dirhams (around \u00a38). To some travellers less experienced this could be fairly intimidating but, ultimately, Jemaa el Fna and the souks beyond are very safe. The trick to negotiating this part of Marrakesh is to avoid making eye contact with anyone unless you are interested in buying from them. If you should get lost in the souks (as many people do, even locals) don't make the mistake of asking directions or, again, you will be expected to pay even though, most of the time, you are being sent even deeper into what I can only describe as a labyrinth. In our one and only venture into the souks, it took my friend and I three long hours to get out again, during which time we were cajoled and hassled by vendors and locals looking to part you from our cash. If you must go into them, make sure you remember how to get back to where you started or hire a guide."

I ask you kindly not to take photo with the monkeys in chains. They have chains around there necks and get pulled around the Jemma El fna so tourist take photo with them. There tails have been cut and they are put in clothes and nappy for our entertainment. I sat on the roof and watched how bad the handlers treat them. Pulling them around , kicking them and hitting them .They look so sad. Maybe if people stop paying there handlers will go and find real jobs and stop abusing these poor animals.

When viewing any of the side shows - the \"performers\" will draw you into the circle and they have cronies who come up next to you and try to pick your pocket! It happened to my husband but fortunately we wore a money belt along his waist. He felt the pick pocket, but also noticed the guys friends surrounding him (the pick pocketer) so he could make a quick get away and you would be blocked from going after him.Other than that, it is a marvelous place to wander around feel the pulse of the city. We recommend having a break at the Cafe France restaurant second floor terrace and watch the stories unfold below."

I knew not to take photos unless I wanted to fork over some money, so I didn't have the experiences some of the previous reviewers had. However, we learned that if you are standing waiting for some entertainment to begin, someone may come and tell you to give money. When that happened we just said that nothing had started yet and we walked away. They usually went to the tourists first. I have never traveled anywhere where people asked for money so much or were so aggressive of sales persons as in this country. By the time we went to the square, we had learned how to say, \"No\" easily. The square is certainly not to be missed. I would not take young children there in the evening since it is so crowded and dark in several places."

Most of them selling souvenirs, fresh fruit juices or nuts/dried fruit. I would recommend to at least try the fruit juices. They are freshly squeezed and cheap; you can drink them from a glass on the spot or have them to go in a plastic cup.In the evening the square really comes to life. Music groups and all kinds of other \"artists\" do their thing and a circle of mostly local people forms around them. If you enjoy what you see you are expected to leave a small amount to give expression to your appreciation.Furthermore, the food stands open up. You should really try them. The food is absolutely safe and prices are low. A two person meal including drinks (no alcohol obviously) will cost you between 150 and 250 MAD, unless you're a really big eater. Most of the stands offer the same for exactly the same prices (we counted four kinds of food stands), so just pick the one that looks best to you. Or have yourself reeled in by the men in front of the stands. It's kind of a sport to them. We liked to go with it and choose the stand which had the best talk / pitch that evening."

The two gents in the attached photo came over & asked her for a donation then, when she went to pay them, instantly became more friendly, dressing us up & taking our picture with them.

I must admit, I was somewhat familiar with what to expect when I entered the main square in the medina of Marrakech, Jemaa el Fna, but that still did not prepare me for the reality of all the sounds and sights of what I experienced. Apparently in all my preparation, I completely missed the part about not photographing the snake charmers unless you are willing to fork over some moroccan dirham. Yes, I made THAT mistake. Next thing I know I am being chased and hounded by one of the men surrounding the snakes. The lowest dirham amount I had was 100, the equivalent of $10 USD-but there I was being forced to fork that over or cause a small riot in the square. Next thing I know, another man goes up to the man hounding me. They proceed to exchange words and the shoves and there I was, in the middle of what appeared to be an all-out brawl about to happen because I didn't pay the snake charmer. With that, I threw the 100 dirham at the man and left in a panic due to fears that my iphone camera would be smashed. But again, I didn't learn my lesson because I wondered over to one of the henna artists. Completely absorbed by the quick artistry of the woman, I snap a picture with my iphone. Next thing I know, a woman comes up to me and proceeds to grab my hand and start to draw with her henna bottle. I told her numerous times that I did not have any money-it went to the snake charmer-but she kept doing her thing. So there I am standing with a beautiful design on my hand and no money to pay the woman. It must have been the final and strongly asserted \"NO MONEY\" that made her grab my hand again, take her finger and wipe the design off my hand. If she didn't have a veil covering her face, I think she would've spit on me. So, there you have it-the stupid American tourist tale of Jemaa el Fna. Even with that bad experience, there is nothing like the square-enjoy it, absorb the sights, listen to the lovely call to prayer that blasts from the speaker above the mosque in the square, and have a freshly squeezed orange juice from one the of million stands. But whatever you do, don't photograph the snake charmers or henna artists unless you have some dirham to pass out!"

            "review": "A must see, but go prepared!. A visit to Jemaa El Fna is an inevitable consequence of your trip to Marrakech, so dive in and enjoy the madness. During the day time there a some stalls open but these are predominantly orange sellers where a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice will cost you 4 dirhams, roughly 30p depending on the exchange rate you get. We had lots of these and they were all delicious. All the stalls display the same price around the market. There are also snake charmers, people with monkeys and water sellers in traditional costume. All of these will want you to have a photograph taken with them. If that's what you want then fine, but they will expect payment in return. Most will ask for 'paper', meaning a note, 20 dirhams or about \u00a31.50. Some will suggest that it's free. Nothing is free in Marrakech, you'll get pestered for the money, so accept that is how it is. Top tip is to carry plenty of change, 5, 10 dirham coins, which you can give for tips if you really want those photos. If you are friendly but firm in saying NO then you'll have no problems. If you look like a soft touch, you'll be pursued recently. The market people will have been told NO a thousand times already that day, so it's no big deal. Just walk on, you don't need to be too polite and British about it!Many ladies will wonder about what to wear whilst out. In general it's fine to wear short sleeved tops and shorts. Just understand that the tops are best not too revealing and the shorts not too short. You do not have to cover your head.Tourists wander around the streets entirely safely, even in the dark alleys and souks at night. The locals will almost invariably be respectful and courteous. Public displays of affection are best limited to a hug and a peck on the cheek and perhaps holding hands, to avoid causing offence.Another top tip when out and about is to have a decent street plan and after your arrival have a walk around and get to know your way. If you need to ask the way it will cost you, remember everything has its price. What can happen is that you ask the way and you'll get sent in completely the wrong direction, then when you get lost, miraculously the same person will then stumble across you and very politely take you on a big loop back to where you wanted to go, then expect a tip. Just go with all this kind of thing, let's face it a few dirhams is a lot of money to the locals and nothing to most of us, treat it as part of the experience. If you fight against it, you'll not enjoy Marrakech at all. In the evening, around 1900 hrs at this time of year, the place really comes alive. Loads of stalls, loads of food. Some of it is good. Go to where the locals gather is the best tip. Always order off a priced menu, otherwise you'll get all kind of things and a big bill you didn't expect.There are all sorts of gathering for everything from storytellers, musicians, even boxing if you fancy it! You can happily watch all these for no cost, so it's possible to spend and evening out for little cost.If you are buying in the souks, obviously never pay the price you are asked. A reasonable rule of thumb is to offer around 1/3 of the price asked, but sometimes this can be too much! You'll know you've got the lowest offer if they let you walk off without selling it to you.Never do anything without knowing the price first. Local trips of a couple of miles in a taxi should cost around 30 to 40 dirhams. A trip to the airport around 100. There are thousands of taxis, you'll never ever have to worry about finding one. If you take an hour long trip on one of the many horse and carriages that should cost you around 100-150 dirhams. It's all pretty cheap.The sweet pastries on sale everywhere look lovely, just be aware that they are not as sweet as they look and may might not be to your taste, so ask to sample first.One final tip, Never Ever change money at the airport. If you do, either in the UK or Marrakech you will receive a truly miserable exchange rate. At Gatwick 1000 dirhams cost us \u00a3104.00, from an ATM in Marrakech HSBC gave me 1000 dirhams for \u00a366.00. I will never make this mistake again, I urge you not to get caught out.In short, if you practice saying NO thank you and carry a pocketful of change, you can't go far wrong. I've been twice and will definitely go again. My partner wouldn't want to go alone, but many people do. It's safe, but the faint hearted Can find it a little intimidating."

During the day it's hot, it's full of people, you have your pick of hundreds of different stalls, there's live music and plenty of options in regards to food.At night is where it really comes alive though, 6pm until 2am, this place is buzzing.It can be aggressive at first, people seem aggressive and pushy. But once you learn to say no sternly, and they know you mean it, it's fine. I also found that being a ride aggressive yourself and threatening violence casually seems to make the sellers laugh and then it gets friendly.There are guys with monkeys who come very close to you and will often sneak up behind you and lob their monkey on you. They then haggle with you for a price to get the monkey off. This can be a bit scary, as the monkeys are quite big and have obviously sharp teeth. But being stern helps and the guy will leave you alone.There's also snake charmers. If you get close, you will be asked for money, if you take a picture, you will be asked for money. My tip here, is pay first! I offered 20 dh just to get close and take a picture, the guy said to me \"fine, but pay after\" he then lets you take pictures and takes your phone off you to take a picture of you himself with the snake, he then insists on a group picture etc etc.Then you go to leave, and he says 20dh is no good, and refuses to let you leave until you pay 200dh. To make sure you don't leave, he wraps a python around your neck and asks you to hold the head, and he continues to push (aggressively) for the 200dh.Do not be polite here! it doesn't work. With these guys, when they do this, you must be assertive.I threatened to knock this guy out and I was firm and rude about it. I also threatened to remove the snake and shuv it up his ....Entertaining though... you'll have some good stories.The food markets are also very pushy trying to get you in. But they're good natured and it's all fun.Food on offer, snails, sheep spleens, goat heads etc.Live music is always on offer, and this is really great music. Gnaoua music is like a trance music and you will be hooked on it.There's so much going on, it's not worth talking about. I won't cover even a fraction of it.Good times!"

It is easy to get resentful as a visitor to the constant hassle for cash and feel you are just a walking ATM but I saw one of the Henna Bandit women set up and start the full on hassle for about an hour with the hand grabs etc. She finally got a customer and then disappeared. I saw her half an hour later and she had gone to get something to eat with the money she had just earned! I still didn't give in to the hasslers (and some could be insistent, aggressive and rude) but (as I had dinner with a couple of local people I knew) realised that most of them were living hand to mouth and a few dirham more would make little difference to me but would help some desperately poor people and their families in most cases so was happy to help out the quiet ones,"

It is a great animation, and many people (especially tourists) are going to have dinner. Take care, and order always with the menu, after agreeing the price. If you are offered the possibility to have a choice of different specialities, take care: the trick consists in giving to the tourists many small dishes of every kind to \"discover moroccan food\".

When entering the jemaa, you will be bombarded with people lobbying for you to choose their food station. Once you accept that you just have to keep walking and ignore their pleas to sit at their station, and begin see all of the different stands, the fun begins. There are a variety of interesting foods on display and a variety of prices, but at the end of the day you can get a full meal for 2 for under $15 easily. The lesson we learned was that the more patrons you see, the more likely that the food is good and freshly cooked. Overall this is a fun experience, and you can eat normal moroccan food or you can get adventurous and have snails or whatever part of a lamb you choose, for example, but no matter what it is a fun eating experience like no other. As a personal recommendation, I recommend Chez Aicha (stall No. 1) as the place to go. She is queen of the jemaa for a reason."

The bad thing about it is you will be hassled SO much by stall holders, sellers, henna artists etc. to the point where it's completely overwhelming. You cannot take a photo of anyone without them wanting a tip and that's fine but they will get aggressive if you don't tip them enough. Also, as a western woman I was harassed by men a lot.. Some of which where touching/grabbing me but they would quickly walk off into the dark sea of people before I could properly react. WOMEN: be very aware of who is around you.. I saw men getting extremely close behind my friend whilst she was watching a performer obviously trying to rub up against her. Just be very careful of this."

Of course you can call it a tourist trap, but you can say that about almost every \"city center\" on earth. The old market is FULL of life and it is so much fun \"getting lost\" in the market, just walking around and looking at all the stuff the locals are selling, spices, beautiful tea glasses, pasminas, fabrics, all kinds of crazy medicine in the pharmacies, and you name it!. You see a lot of expensive crap but you can also get a good deal on good stuff if you are a master of bargaining. That is what they want you to do. Just start by taking half of the price they start with and work your way up, or down for that matter. Just decide on what you are truly ready to pay for the things you want and stick with that. It\u00b4s a little show you make together, you and your seller. Sometimes it\u00b4s good to just walk away end they will run after you and offer you a better deal. And don\u00b4t buy what you are looking for at the first shop you see, take your time. Often you'll find exactly the same stuff in another shop much cheaper. Try to find a small place inside the market that offers mint tea and have a seat and chat with the host. The square is full of people with animals, henna tattoo artists, fortune tellers, story tellers and you name it! They will all try to sell you or \"show\" you something and they ALWAYS want money. It is a good rule to start every conversation with \"I am not going to pay you anything\" and then later if you feel like it you can of course always pay. You can also except to have kids coming up to you and offering to show you the right way to some restaurant or if you are a bit lost in the market (it\u00b4s huge and easy to get lost) and they of course want your money too. My husband started to have a lot of lollypops in his pockets and give the kids instead of money. You have to be very firm in every situation if you don't want to give everybody money! The orange juice they are selling on the square is so good, some people say that they mix it with tap water and you can get ill in your stomach but I have not had that experience, I just love it and you can taste how fresh it is!! And it is also great fun to eat on the square with the locals\u2026very cheap street food that they make on the spot.

I speak Arabic so I found it fairly easy to Tam call me haggle with the market people, however I understand it can be difficult for westerners because they do often ask for 5 times more than the value. We developed a technique of chanting \"50 dirhams, 50 dirhams\" as a group (or however much we wanted for the item) this would both make the shop keeper laugh as well as embarrassed and they will often give it to you for the price you offer- we would also always clap and cheer when they agreed the price! They found it entertaining and we got our price- win - win really! The thing I found most annoying is the shop keepers harassing you to come in and have a look, we often found that the ones who let us be were the ones we bought from. Be sure to acknowledge their harassment or they tend to get pretty rude and take it very personally. Also be very firm about beggers and where you point your camera. If you take a photo of he performers they'll harass you for money. We bought so many things from here. Be sure to visit!"

It is very hard to visit the city without spending some time here. It is vital to have your wits about you in the square though. You must be ready to say \"no\" to pretty much every person you see as almost everyone there is trying to sell you something. I would give this 4 stars as an experience while in Marrakech and it certainly is a must see, however, there are a number of downsides. There will be a number of people walking around with monkeys on chains who will try to put the monkeys on your shoulder and offer pictures then will try to charge ridiculous amounts of money for this. The best way to deal with these is to either give a firm \"no\" and keep walking or if you do really want a picture, get the monkey off of your arm and demand that the price of a picture is agreed and written down for you before any other step is taken. Additionally there will an array of others trying to sell you one thing or another from food to henna tattoos to orange juice etc. The most important thing in the square is to be very firm but not rude with everyone and if you do not want something refuse it firmly but politely.Finally, there are a number of restaurants with rooftop dining areas overlooking the market which are worth eating in at least once for the views of the market. Overall it is definitely a must see but it must be remembered that the vendors there will be trying to sell anything to you. Just be careful and enjoy the sights and sounds."

As the evening deepens and the air cools off, the vast open square fills with people. Rows of food stands are set up, each complete with its own seating. A row of carts sells dishes of cooked snails. Other rows of carts sell freshly squeezed glasses of orange and other juices. There are storytellers, acrobats, monkeys with diapers, women painting henna tattoos on tourists, shoeshine men, and people set up on blankets selling all sorts of items. I enjoy walking past the carts that sell spices and incense, as the fragrant smoking samples perfume the evening air with frankincense. Around the perimeter of the square are dozens of small stands selling all manner of Moroccan souvenirs.

I preferred evenings there as it was bustling with entertainment. Do not take your camera phones out unless you want to give the entertainers money. As soon as they see your phone in hand, they ask you for money and behave rudely. Don't make eye contact with any stall holders or entertainers unless you want them to bother you. Take your time there and enjoy the atmosphere."

This place can be very very overwhelming and you need to just take your time with the place. give it a couple of visits and it will definitely grow on you. dont dismiss it on the first visit itself. make sure you are firm with your NOs. there are all manner of people vying for your attention, there are street performers, monkey wranglers, snake charmers and Henna-appliers just make sure you are firm with your NOs and dont extend your arm out too much lest they grab it . people here are generally good natured and all just looking to make a quick buck. it is a photographers paradise with so many opportunities to click that amazing travel-blog/magazine worthy picture. but these people are quick and even when you think you are sneaky with your photography they will descend on you to ask you for money. instead agree a price for a picture first and then take the pictures your want to they will ask for an absurd amount of money and be firm with how much you want to pay them. do not miss the orange juice carts - the sellers are all very good natured and they put on an act of being disappointed when you chose another cart than theirs and its all good natured banter. after the second or third night in Marrakech we began to love the energy of the square and were sad to be leaving at the end of our trip. we didnt sample the food there because we are vegetarians and didnt feel like eating there but we saw a lot of people eating there so if you are feeling brave then by all means go ahead! if I ranked it on first visit it would be a 2 star but it grew on us and we hope you give it a chance as well"

The square is quieter with stalls selling delicious fresh orange juice for approx 50p - not to be missed. My teenage daughter found it quite upsetting to see the monkeys ( chains around their necks and dressed up in diapers). At the far side of the square close to the Mosque La Koutoubia there are many horse and carriages - the horses looked very tired and not so well looked after. She did not want to go back, but I managed to persuade her to visit in an evening.....The square came alive with many food stalls selling all sorts of Morroccan dishes, sweets, fruit, dates and nuts. Of course we were hassled to come and eat, but it was not intimidating and fun if you joke with the friendly sellers. Our only regret was we had just eaten and did not try any food. It all looked so delicious.. The monkeys and snake charmers were still there, but not so i\"in your face\" as they were shadowed by the entertainers and music. Not to be missed in the evening, but avoid in the daytime if you are a bit sensitive to animal welfare."

At night it was buzzing and crazy but my friend and I were disappointed with the vendors particularly where the food stalls were. They were very much in your face and aggressive. We were polite and told them we were just looking around and they swore and spoke to us quite rudely. Which for two young women isn't a particularly nice memory of such a lovely city. We tried to purchase a couple of traditional dresses and when we tried to barter the vendor still wanted to rip us off. We told him we didn't want to buy them and we walked away but the vendor grabbed my arm and held it tightly I had to prise my arm out of his hand. That really put me off. The women who do the henna they get you to look at the designs they say they charge 120 dirhams. We told her we'll come back she said to my friend let me give you a present and took her hand and starting doing a design which then became a full blown design. My friend gave her 30 dirhams she said this is nothing I told you it's 120. My friend said you told me it's a present! I understand they need money but to feel like you're being taken the piss out of on your holiday can spoil it. We found the local market close to our riad a much nicer experience.

A polite ''la shokran'' may work, it may not. A more forceful ''no thank you'' may work or may not. Our experience was that when VERY POLITELY told ''la shokran'' (no thank you), you could be ignored and an attempt to paint you regardless may continue. Being more forceful is met with ''Oh my God'' or a very dismissive ''Jeez''. DO NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT LOOKING AFTER YOURSELF AND SAYING A VERY FIRM BUT POLITE ''NO''.We only ventured in by day when the market wasn't at full flow so cannot comment on evenings in the square. Daytime was enough for me personally - busy, vibrant, harassing, smelly, uncomfortable and constantly waiting for the henna hag from hell to abuse us for not wishing to be dyed with some indeterminable gloop. If getting henna'd, I'd advise to go somewhere established where the product is less likely to cause a bad reaction and you'll be able to barter the price BEFORE being ''inked''.The ladies in the square will try to make you feel really crappy for rejecting them. Don't fall for it.Everywhere we went people were literally shouting at us to go buy their orange juice. It's neither here nor there and was acceptable as everyone is trying to make a living. Just be aware this kind of thing may happen. After reading on TA about others' experiences, I was weary of even getting my phone out let alone of taking pictures, so took none. By day, there's little to see to be honest.The souks were far less forceful - however, I did dress respectfully; covered head to foot, arms covered with a headscarf on which bought me more time than the average tourist as I didn't stick out like a sort thumb.Jemaa el Fna is possibly something to experience by night providing you are incredibly aware of the fact that practically everyone is trying to part you from your cash by fair means or foul."

Night food market from about 6pm is brilliant - look for the one or two stalls amongst the 100 that have locals eating and don't have hawkers trying to drag you in. Cafe Glacier has great views from above the market and do a great tagine."

            "review": "A crazy place!. So much is going on in the Jemaa that you don't know where to look. It's easy to find from anywhere inside the Marrakech Medina - especially since everyone everywhere assumes that is what you are looking for and points you in the general direction. Beware of those who want to walk you right there - or walk you anywhere, for that matter. The trip will end with a hand out, palm up, demanding money for the service. A service that you didn't necessarily ask for, by the way. But that is the way it goes in Marrakech. Anything can be had for a price. And even when you agree on a price first, an extra service or item you didn't request will ratchet the cost up a bit more. The Jemaa is geared toward tourists. Henna, snake charmers, dancers, musicians all abound. And if you linger anywhere close to where they are \"performing,\" or, God forbid, bring your camera up to snap a casual photo, you will be immediately accosted - \"You take photo, you pay!!\" At night the scene changes. Food stalls everywhere, with cooks and servers all doing their best to lure you in to try their offerings. Most of them seem to have the same food, although a few have goat, sheep and calf skulls on display on the tables where customers eat. Not sure what that's trying to advertise but it didn't look too appetizing. Most of the kebobs are good and tasty. The pastries that are sold from the carts look better than they taste. It actually seems to be a \"chain,\" so all the carts offer the same little cakes. The Jemaa is a must-see, day or night. It's easy to figure out what to try and what to try to avoid."

I kind of liked that you could take a picture with the animals and play with them and you give what you think is a good price and they are more than happy to accept whatever you give them. Freshly squeezed orange juice available at almost every turn. their also lots of women who were doing henna tattoos."

There are great prices on pashmina, leather goods, pottery, woodwork, tile mosaics, and just about everything else you could possibly be looking for. On the negative side, I was definitely more nervous about pickpockets here than anywhere else in Morocco since the square is open and swarming with people, and there were a fair number of child beggars. I felt pretty horrible for the collared monkeys on chains - they looked well-fed but miserable. The overall experience shouldn't be missed."

It's certainly an overload on your senses from the sounds of the snake charmer to the smells of the food being cooked at night. Start taking photos of the snakes, the monkeys or anyone and expect to be shown a hat to put money in. In the food market at night expect to get hassled by every stall plying for your money.

Wear comfortable shoes as there is plenty of walking around the souks and ensure you have a hat and water if visiting in the day as can get very hot.Orange juice is plentiful and a must try along with the food that is sold by a number of vendors both in the square and just on the outside the square. The souk in itself is an experience and easy to lose your way. If buying spices such as saffron ensure you do not buy it in powder form and ensure it is strands. Some vendors may try and pass saffron of as another spice. Remember to barter in the souks and walking away often helps lower the price even further."

There is so much to see and take in, it can overwhelm.If it's your first time I recommend eating at number 25 (i have eaten here6/7 times over two trips) I found the men that run it very honest and polite. The guy in the red shirt speaks good English. For orange juice i liked number 36.Every store claps as you enter it is a greeting and almost a thank you for stopping don't be embarrassed or alarmed!If they bring something you didn't order simply say so! Or tell them it wasn't you that ordered the dish. Don't let it sit by you.. moroccan menus keep the food coming this is where this practice comes from it is to make you feel at home, not to dupe you as a tourist it is to ensure you leave full and more than likely happy. Do query your bill if it Is higher than expected, they will explain and if they make a mistake it will be corrected.After eating If it is your first time I recommend heading to the roof top bar next to the bank. Go upstairs it overlooks the main square. Entry is the price of a drink (25dh) from this height you get to take in the beauty and atmosphere of the square and skyline without being asked to 'have a look' - when you do brave the square and you're asked to have a look and are not interested say with a smile 'maybe later' or 'fo-lus ka-las' (means money has finished) the locals will laugh and laugh with you, possible pat your shoulder and send you on your way.There are small children and old people begging. If you are looking in your bag/ have a kind face expect to be approached. Enjoy your time here, let the good times roll! Don't be scared or put off, the culture is very different but embrace it!"

In any case it is like walking back in time and can feel like a film set, but in a good way. The cafes and restaurants are good but the view,the noise, the atmosphere and yes the smells are what it is all about. The experience will never leave you. Be careful of the street vendors, they can be somewhat bothersome and avoid the street vendor food unless you have an iron stomach. The cafe food is safesafe. The adjacent souks are fabulous but maze like, don't bother with a map just lose yourself for a few hours. Jemaa El Fna should be on everyone's bucket list. Oh and if female, dress modestly or you will get unwanted attention."

One of them threw a snake around my neck, took my camera and said \"picture, picture\" ... and only afterwards did he ask for an OUTRAGEOUS amount in dirhams before giving me my camera back and finally removing the snake from my neck. Kind of a dirty trick - he must be a wealthy man! But we learned not to get fooled so easily! At night it's quite a struggle to get past the food stalls, because everybody comes up to you and guarantees that theirs is the best place to eat. Just pick one of the places - they more or less all offer the same food and it'll save you for a lot of struggle getting past the sometimes almost aggressive people trying to get customers. But - after all, this is a good place to learn your lessons ... go there on your first day in Marrakech and learn the rules. Knowing how to bargain will make the rest of your stay a lot more pleasant and will save you a lot of money!"

The fresh juice can sometimes be warmer.If you have the opportunity, try and get a reservation at one of the medina restaurants with a terrace for around 6:30 or 7:00. You'll catch the sunset, and have a great seat for the change over from day to night. The food's not great but the action is exciting.If you not something a little more local, try one of the orange roofed food stalls, but do know that as soon as you sit down, they might start putting food in front of you without you ordering.

            "review": "Ok and worth a visit but over rated.. This is the main place to go at nights, you get variety if food places from stalls to restaurants, souks and traders and not very good shows. Initially the senses are overwhelmed with the crowds, music, noise, smells,lights etc and is worth a visit but it can get tiresome after a while. It is better to visit at night than the day in my opinion.There is far too much hassle here which after experiencing the souks in the day can really irritate. Apart from the stalls you will be hassled by street traders with sweets, henna artists, snake charmers, people with monkeys, people at the so called shows if you stop to see what is happening especially if you try taking pictures, food stalls and small taty restaurants. Be warned that alot of the people don't understand the concept of no and can be quite sarcastic when you walk away so try to have a light hearted approach even though it can be hard.The food at the stalls is nothing special, good enough to fill you for a a cheap price. Less than \u00a315 for 2 people including drinks but you get what you pay for. The foid is the same in all the stalls and be warned they will charge you for everything, nothing is free including the bread and olivs they give while you wait for your food even though you did not ask for it. Also you Street traders selling fakes watches etc approach people while they are eating which can.be frustrating.The best thing about the square is the fresh orange juice stands. The juice is amazing and starts at 30p for a regular cup from mcdonalds in the UK. The stands are there throughout the day and night.All the stalls sell the same tat throughout the medina. For those that do not want to trall through the he souks constantly and go through the process of haggling or are not too confident, I recommend doing the shopping from here at night. Over all the items are more resonably priced and you can get them for a good price without haggling too much, also many stalls have marked prices on smaller items. You will also find some items that you wont in other parts of the souks.The square also has a few nice restaurant that do good food and also have terraces offering great views."

Bartering is quite fun and you can usually knock them down to at least half the price of their original offer. There are a lot of beggars and horses/cats which isnt very comfortable to be around. Beware of henna women! They don't tell you the price of the henna and keep decorating you until you physically pull your arm away then charge you extortionate prices! My friend and I asked for a design on our hand but she started to go up our arm. When we said stop, they told us it would cost 800dhs each (\u00a3130 total!). We didnt have this much money on us. We only had 50dhs and so had to surrender a scarf and a purse as payment before they would let us go! Completely shameful behaviour and makes the rest of the sellers down who try to be fair to tourist. Now that I've been, I can tick it off the list and not have to visit it again!"

They are next to each other, often difficult to decide what seting area belongs to which but they pretty much d the same food: the grilled food ones(kebabs, veggies, often tagines, soup - some veggie broth soup, somewhat underseasoned but still nice) and the ones you won't know what to make of: half flat bread stalls where they cut the bread, fill it with mashed boiled potatoes, egg and olive oil. Ahh and the orange juice stalls. Again, if you wondering which one to pick: even they will tell you, they all do pretty much the same food! It is quite smokey within the square but also the little restaurants and cafes around the square are worth looking at, if for nothing else then go to the roof terrace and enjoy the evening views. Also some of those cafes have the same prices as the actual stalls. Prices: a soup is 5-10 dirhams, bread 5 dirhams. Kebab sticks cost about 40 dirhams and you will fill up. Even if you are really hungry, you wont spend more than 80 dirhams and be painfully overfed!One thing i found quite annoying was that once they get you to sit down, it might take a while to actually get some food so do not be in a great rush. Also the food is safe, noone had any funny tummy from the 8 of us stuffing our faces."

The square comes to life after dark there are a huge number of food stalls, cafes and restaurants to chose from catering to most tastes and pockets. The atmosphere is chaotic as the masses bustle around looking for bargains or for a spot to eat, the noise aromas and sights transporting you back in time. Entertainment comes in many forms from dancers, snake charmers, story tellers or just observing the crowd my favourite being watching the gangs of young pickpockets ply their trade. If you visit Marrakech if you only do one thing you must pay the square a visit."

Its so funny because the Moroccan guys have learnt the English/Cockney accent to catch our attention and try and get you to eat at their stall. We had such a laugh with one of the guys from stall number 31! So funny! The orange juice they sell there is so refreshing, I need a glass right now!Now, the 'Be careful' bit....So all the different entertainers, they will just grab you, and role you into part of their show/service/whatever they are offering, and then, when you try to walk away, they wont let you go because they start demanding money! It gets a bit uncomfortable and strained when you try to walk away. Do NOT just let them put snakes on you or hats or take part in anything unless you want to and you are prepared to pay them. Always bargain and half the price of anything and everything you buy/use because the horse & carriage people, taxi's, keepsake sellers will always try their best to take as much money as they can with you.Putting all that aside, I loved it! :D"

Surrounded by lovely rooftop restaurants, serving traditional Moroccan food and everywhere serves pizza and pasta, if you're not feeling adventurous. Every stall sells the same sort of thing, so have a look around and barter your socks off! I would definitely recommend trying the fresh orange juice from one of the stalls in the centre of the square, it's delicious and only 4dhs, which isn't even 50p. As two young girls we did get some unwanted attention from men, but they soon got the message. They will try and attract you into their shop by saying things like geezer, fish and chips and various other britanisms but it's all in good jest. We didn't get pictures of the monkeys or snakes, as it was clear that they were being poorly treated although our vey nice taxi driver did tell us to pay no more than 30dhs if we did, so keep this in mind. They wil approach you and out the snake around your neck without you asking and then try to charge you about 600dhs, as will the henna ladies. They will grab your arm and just start doodling away, but if you didn't ask DON'T PAY. As the hours go by the square will get busier and busier and be prepared to be knocked about when they call for prayer, as they rush to the mosques. There are at least three around the square, so the call is very loud. Definitely worth a visit if you are visiting Marrakech."

A mint tea now costs 14 dirham, about a dollar fifty.There are, however, a number of ridiculously cheap restaurants which set up under awnings in the square but the level of hygiene they have is positively subpar. Same goes for the numerous 'fresh' fruit juice stands where a tall glass of fruit juice cost about 40 cents.Never forget, you get what you pay for, and Marrakesh is a spot where this saying could not be more accurate."

I loved it but there are some tips to make it a fun AND safe experience: It's best not to carry a handbag. If you want to take photos of the entertainment acts, be prepared to pay them or they get very nasty. Give them what you want, ignore their insistence on more, they always want additional cash. Beware if you are afraid of snakes or monkeys, you will have one on you the second you come close, then get charged for the photo op, like it or not (I have a viper-pic to proof it haha). Vendors are on tourists like ticks. Firmly saying \"La\", which means \"No\" in Arabic, gets them to disappear a little faster. They miraculously speak just about any language and will engage you in endless sales pitches and negotiations. It can get annoying and time consuming. The souk around the plaza is fun and interesting also, but the souvenirs are more expensive here. Overall though the prices in Marrakech were rather low. Shopping here won't break the bank but hackle a bit and keep your cash hidden at all times. The fresh squeezed orange juice at stand # 38 was delicious!"

But at night, all the locals come out as well as the tourist filling the square.There are food stalls, street acts and lots more.

However come dusk the place comes alive with a great feeling and loads of atmosphere. The street stalls or pop up restaurants are an experience in themselves. Could it be that you pay too much for just a decent meal. Sure. However, will you have that experience anywhere else in the world? I think not. We took our daughter who was 11mths old at the time and she loved it. The whole experience was super family friendly and very safe. Be smart about what you choose but we had no ill effects from eating from the stalls. Also loved the dessert sweets carts that came around and sold boxed sweets to go. What wonderful memories you will make here!"

On the main square during the day, you can wander amongst the orange juice stands and street vendors, and watch the snake charmers and belly dancers. It's also the central hub for accessing the souks. Despite being tourist-driven, the hassle of everyday life can also be seen here. Once night falls, the square turns into a street food markets with lots of stands offering Moroccan style food such as meat skewers, tagines and a whole sheep's head (including brains and tongue!) The night market has an electric atmosphere, with music and entertainment scattered everywhere so has a festival-style feel too it. It does get exceptionally busy though especially on Saturday and Sunday nights. Be prepared to be harassed by hoards of locals trying to get you to eat at their stand, there's a lot of competition, and once you are seated, they don't want you to leave."

After litterarily escaping we decided to eat where we were bothered the least; food was, by the way, o.k., not as good as in real restaurants, and due to this experience we never went back.

It's quite a large square, and depending on the time of day, the stalls may only take up a small part of it. The rest is snake charmers, monkey dancers, storytellers, and all sorts of street vendors, many of which will be unfamiliar to you. We went in August, which is when many Moroccans get their vacation, so most of the tourists were domestic. This made it more fun, and it was interesting to see what the locals were most interested in.Vendors can be a little pushy, and can annoy you trying to get you into their restaurant. Be ready for this; either ignore them completely, or a firm 'no', 'non merci', 'la shukran' usually gets the job done without the need to be rude.I mean, if you're in Marrakech, you can't not go here.

They ask around 150-200 dirhams to take one photo! In the market stalls there are plenty of gifts and souvenirs to buy, but beware as the prices are VERY high. You can usually buy goods for 30-50% of the price they ask for! Don't be scared to walk away if they say no for the price, as there will definitely be another shop selling the same thing.

At night however, the place really comes alive and it is a sight to be seen. The locals are all out with their children and the world and his wife seem to congregate here to feast and shop.

Do not let people say it is there just for the 'foriegn' tourists, if someone does, just ask them if they can understand Berber.

I visited with my husband and 3 kids (11,8 &7) Prior to visiting, I had the impression we would be seeing a beautiful, busy, vibrant hive of activity with stalls, food, entertainment. What we actually got was a vast, unattractive square with a couple of snake charmers and a few stall selling cheap tat. The kids wanted to see the snakes so we peeked around some other tourists only to be grabbed by an old man who then stuck a snake (which looked dead) around my daughters' necks and then started demanding money! Now I am good at saying no and can be very firm but this man got very unpleasant and even grabbed my daughter's shoulder and stated telling her that I was bad for not giving him money. She was understandably frightened and was then very nervous for the rest of our trip. Once you get past this area, the markets are lovely, especially if you can make your way to the leather and silk areas where you get to see little workshops as well as stalls.Maybe the square is different at night but my kids didn't want to go back so I never got to find out!"

If you like a quiet life, stay away!The overriding ethos in the square is that all tourists are game! Every single person has their hand out, literally in most cases. This does not make it a bad thing, but there were some overly 'aggressive' selling methods that you need to be aware of.Henna - if you are a lady who wants their hands covering in henna, then great as you have plenty of choices. Just sort out the price BEFORE they start covering your hands. Saw a few occasions where women were physically grabbed and had henna on them before they knew what was happening.Animals - Snakes / monkeys/chipmunks, etc. Basic rule, be prepared to pay for asking questions, taking photos or sometimes just being mildly interested.Guides - don't want one? Then just politely keep saying no to anyone and everyone who wants to help you get to the 'big square' or tell you the best cafe, or point out what is open or closed. Lovely people, BUT they don't talk to you for nothing.As I said early, We loved it. It is an experience, but you must be aware of what is around you, be prepared to haggle (50% of original prices is a good pointer), it is a vibrant and amazing place and should not be missed. But EVERYONE is there to make money from you. Accept that and have a great time."

So much as look at any of these creatures and you will be accosted for cash. The fresh orange juice stalls are a must - it was the best orange juice I've ever tasted and at about 20 cents per glass, one cannot go wrong. Come nightfall, the snakes and macaques go away only to be replaced by hundreds of outdoor food/drink stalls (the orange juice vendors being an all day mainstay) along with huge group circles at the center of which Berber soothsayers, storytellers, shamans or dancers dazzle onlookers. The square becomes so crowded by night it is truly difficult to process, but absolutely must be experienced. Unless, of course, you suffer from agoraphobia in which case steer clear of the Medina altogether and especially Jemma el F'naa."

We actually ventured too deep at one point during the night and found ourselves amongst the working men and women and families who actually lived there. A young man saw us and realized that we were sort of lost and pointed us into the right direction back to the main square. But what an experience! Truly a sight to see!

The locals will shout at you, talk in a rather pushy manner to lure you into their restaurant. It is funny for the first time, but can become annoying and sometimes they make comments that might be a bit aggressive...The prices are a bit high compared to the standards of Morocco, but still cheaper than the typical touristy restaurants in the city. All in all, you can have a decent dinner from about 60-70 dirham per person.Don't spend too much time on comparing the prices of stalls, they are nearly all the same, rather look for the place where more locals eat and not only tourists.Food to try:- snails- harira (chickpeas soup) with dates and sweets- lamb's head- different types of kebabs (lamb, beef, chicken...)- fried seafood (this was not so good...)- olives/bread/chili sauce- grilled vegetables- different types of tagines- variety of couscousGood advice:- Ask for the price of everything put on the table, there is no free stuff in Morocco, whatever is put there and you haven't asked for but touched is quite likely to be charged on the bill- Don't eat fresh salad and other fresh things...Risk of contamination is high."

Jamaa El Fna is simply the market square, a huge open space where market stall holders sell their wares or food. By day it is totally different than by night, but be sure to experience both.During the day it's more subdued, lots of juice and water stalls, dried fruit & nut stalls, some snake charmers, henna tattoo artists and people selling argan oil in all forms. At the juice stalls you'll get harassed by the local kids begging for money - offer to buy them a juice, they are really poor and this simple, cheap experience for you will be something important to them.There are also a bunch of horse and carriages for tourist rides. It's busy, it's dusty it's smelly but it's an amazing experience. The juice at the stalls are incredibly cheap and with all the Moroccan sunshine taste sweet and quench your thirst. Watch the charmers but don't take photos as they will expect a fee (maybe hide behind some people and be quick!). Henna tattoos are very popular but be careful as there is no hygiene here and you can get an infection. By night the place is like a market, nightclub, restaurant, theatre, festival all wrapped into one. You'll hear the drums and the music being played until about 1:00am every day and you'll see the lights across the Medina as far as the eye can take you. This is when Jamaa El Fna comes to life - all the day stall holders and entertainers are still there but now add, musicians, singers, theatre entertainers, rows and rows of food stall holders with seating - you must eat here regularly, it's fantastic - acrobatics, flying toys being sold and a tonne of people. I love, love, love this place at night. Each food stall holder sells something different, chicken at one, seafood at another, lamb at another and cooked all different ways. Don't forget the delicacy of snails which are popular too! Local kids love the snails but often can't afford them. They are so cheap to Westerners, if you feel so inclined please buy a local kid a bowl of snails. They will come up to you asking for money, but just offer to buy them a bowl of snails and they will smile.Please enjoy Jamaa El Fna, it's a mix of wonderful things, cultures and experiences just waiting for your participation."

Taxis too enjoy the lawlessness, even infront of Airport they were fighting with customer on charges.The so called 5 star hotel did not offer a glass of water at 13:30 july 14 (outside temp. 47 deg-C) it is not in their culture to see visitors as sources of income rather enemies whose money they should fleece by any hux and crux.

Do you, as a traveller, wish to submit yourself to a cultural melting pot of chaos and colour, and get lost in a world away from the comfort of home? If so, Jamaa el Fna is the place to go.Accessing it along a street opposite Koutoubia Mosque on Avenue el Mouahidine (provided you aren't struck down by the crazy traffic first), you enter the heart of the old city of Marrakech along with a seething mass of tourists and locals, traders, motorbikes, and horses pulling decorated carriages. This is where the aforementioned carriages and their drivers line up to entice tourists, offering a tour of the city for wallet-melting prices. My better half and I affectionately named this route as 'Rue de Horse P*ss', as the lack of any purpose-built drainage means that the road is often covered with puddles of urine that wake the olfactory senses with something of a beating.Make it past that, and you find yourself in a vast, open space where thousands of people swarm. The heart of this market square beats with the sound of snake charmers and traders during the day, and surges to a new level of life at night when the dancers, drummers, story-tellers and entertainers, monkey handlers, henna artists, and everything inbetween emerge to ply their trades or promote their talents.Across the square, a bright horizon of juice vendors and food stalls eminate such noise from the edge of the souk (market) behind them. All will fight for your attention, urging you to try their juice (albeit they all sell the same thing for the same price), or their delicious, cheap food. Young men will step in front of you as you dodge and weave your way through the swarm, greeting you with comical cries of \"this place like Sainsburys, come and eat\", or \"more reasons to shop at Morrisons\", and attempt to steer you to their little business. A word of warning at this point: the water used is rarely bottled, and likely to cause considerable unhappiness. The food is unprotected from the flies that naturally thrive in such a climate, and the crockery and cutlery is often only rinsed under tap water by hand. I am sure it tastes wonderful, but we were not disappointed to have avoided such places.The markets remain open until around midnight each night. The cool evening air catalyses the mixture of sights and sounds, and brings out the most incredible stageshow of culture, chaos, and crafts as leather meets silverware, meets spices, and meets silk.The square is policed - officers can be seen patrolling on occasion, and there is a larer police station on the edge - however pickpockets gravitate to the tourist-rich centre, and young men such as myself will be asked by questionable-looking characters to join them for 'hashish' when the officers aren't within earshot. Entertainers and dancers will latch onto those taking photos or filming, or even looking a little bewildered by the whole thing, and will pose for that snapshot or two before insisting on being paid for the pleasure. Having fallen for that trap early-on, I can only recommend maintaining your wits as best you can, and hiding a majority of your cash where nobody can see it so you can demonstrate, with empty wallet open, your inability to pay them the \u00a35 or so that they demand in Moroccan currency or Euros. Vendors and market traders are the same; expect an unhappy response to attempts at photographing the mounds of spices, beautiful lamp collections, or colourful silks unless you tip them for the privilege.The square is, without doubt, a place to revisit during your stay. Don't be put off by one bad experience - being mobbed by entertainers for money, for example. Learn to say \"no\" (I found the phrase \"non, c'est bein, merci\", accompanied by a wave of the hand and walking on briskly, ignoring any pleas, worked brilliantly) and instead soak up the immense atmosphere and amazing whirlwind of this vibrant, beating heart of the city. Haggle if you wish to buy - it is accepted practice and expected in the souks - and grab yourself a bargain or several. Alternatively, seat yourself in one of the many coffee shops around the edge of the square, and enjoy the spectacle from the comfort of your table.Whatever your desire, and whatever your agenda: visit Jamaa el Fna. You wont be disappointed."

Their veins and arteries are the souks, the alleys and small streets that surround it. The blood are the people who swarm around in a constantly back and forth. And when the sun begins to fade into the horizon, the heart pumps even harder. The square builds on itself and becomes a bustling hive, chaotic, noisy, intense. A living organism that is not to see but to feel. Only few places in the world have this intensity and will cause immediate feelings as contradictory. Astonishment and fear, between wanting to go and wanting to stay. However after some time just a feeling might overturn all the others, in my case was to let me swallow.Tip: Whenever you want to say no to salespeople, the photo hunters and beggars, don\u2019t need to be unfriendly, a smile and a firm attitude are enough. 99% of the time results."

Yes you will get bothered by traders and touts but nothing too intimidating and a polite no thanks with a smile will usually have them move onto the next person. A little common sense goes a long way - if you choose to wander around with your wallet on show or expensive cameras or electronic items in hand, no doubt you run the risk of something getting stolen. If you're careful and keep valuables hidden away and money in a front pouch or pocket, you should be fine. On a busy weekend night, this place is heaving - its vast but when busy every single inch is full of every kind of person on earth. Local musicians join up for impromptu jam sessions - if you want to watch and listen, be prepared to drop some coins in the hat as it goes around - after all they do need to earn a crust. The transvestite belly dancers are fun - they wait til someones gives them some money then dance for a short while for the benefit of the person paying. They then stop dancing and taunt the crowd til someone else coughs up, great fun and worth donating a few notes for. Watch out for the henna ladies - they are probably the most aggressive in the square. They do tend to want to grab your hand and start drawing before you realise it, then are likely to demand some money for it. Just avoid them, they dont attack they just take advantage of those who arent concentrating. As soon as you say no firmly but politely they go away and try someone else. Also annoying are the small children trying to sell packets of tissues - they have a habit of walking right in front of you and its often hard to avoid tripping over them. They dont seem to take no as an answer as easily as the traders and food vendors. Dont be tempted to give them money, youll be a target for hundreds more. It's noisy, crowded, in your face and an assault on the senses but it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to see something that will make your jaw drop.. There are some good bargains too to be hard at the stalls in the souks leading off the square into the rest of the medina. It's not all nasty tacky rubbish, the main open fronted shops in the alleyways just to the north of the square sell some exquisite stuff. Just be prepared to enter into lengthy and tiring bartering to get anything however. The stalls and street vendors in the square itself are mostly cheap stuff but some fun items for jokey gifts to take home if you wish. Plenty of nice cafes and restaurants around the edge of the square, some with roof terraces three or four storeys up from where its a great viewpoint to look over the vastness and volume of the square."

Although the sunset view is one to be marvelled at, be warned that the restaurants with the terraces charge you for the privilege whether you order food (over market value) or not. One tip to avoid the constant scamming is to eat on the side streets which run off the main square as these offer much better value for money, with a kebab and chips costing just 14 dirhams. In addition, do not even attempt to take pictures of the snake charmers or monkey handlers as there are a team of them looking for anyone attempting to. They will also come up to you with the poor, abused animals demanding money.Also, do not let anyone give you directions or any help as this may seem like a kind-hearted thing to do, but it's a scam to demand ridiculous sums of money for doing so. Keep in mind that unofficial tour guides in Marrakech are illegal which the locals wholeheartedly ignore, where a simple 'no thank you' will get you verbally abused. However, if you are able to ignore the constant bombardment of stall owners and locals, the square can be quite pleasant, especially when the sun is setting and it starts to come to life."

The square has coffee shops etc for anyone who wishes to sit and watch the world go by, but otherwise if you stand still for too long you will definitely be approached by people selling goods or offering photographic opportunities. My husband offered the snake charmers a small amount of money for one photo but before he knew it they had a put a snake around his neck and taken his camera so they could take more pictures. They expected more money at the end but we refused and walked away so be careful. There are monkeys also which saddened me as they are on leads and wear nappies and people pay to have photos taken with them. We found we were harassed more on the square than in the souks. We didn't see the henna ladies but had been warned that they might just grab our hands and start painting them and then charge us. All of this made me quite nervous and wary so the experience was not especially enjoyable as I spent a lot of the time feeling very suspicious of everyone!

            "review": "Nice place if you have your wits about you. Great food in evening. There are plenty of con-artists, thieves and dishonest traders in the square, all trying to get a slice of tourist cash. If you're careful and have your wits about you, you could enjoy it. As previous reviewers said, don't look too interested in things, don't take pictures or you will be expected to pay, and agree on prices beforehand, refusing to take anything or use any service before agreeing. Walking away is the best strategy to force someone to give you an honest price. Expect to be hassled, so try to be low-key (i found buying and wearing a moroccan jellaba reduces hassle by at least half!).As for the square, the attractions are probably quite interesting for children i imagine. I wasn't very impressed, and I found el-hedim square in meknes to be a more pleasant, low-pressure alternative to the fna in marrakesh with many of the same stalls and performances. It's still hectic and interesting, but with more opportunities to peruse at your leisure without hassle, though there isn't much going on during the mid-day heat.Where the hdim square wins hands-down is in the evenings when the food stalls pop up. The variety is immense, and the food generally fresh and good quality (go to the popular stalls as the food will be fresher and have spent less time standing). The competition from the many stalls means quality is good and prices are reasonable."

            "review": "Djmaa el fna by day and by night. Djamaa el Fna is the central square of the old part of Marrakesh. This enormous square occupies a central position in la M\u00e9dina, the old city of Marrakesh, and is the converging point of many of its streets and souks.It has even been named a \u2018masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity\u201d by UNESCO.During most of the days, performers of every kind put up their shows, continuing until the evening when food trolleys force their way in and occupy half the area and all of the attention of the audience.There are plenty of cafes and restaurants with a rooftop terrace, a great way to see the spectacle unfold while enjoying a drink or a meal.The square has a very long tradition of partying and celebrating - it is here that caravans in the past finished off their route after having spent weeks and months in the desert. Caravan people would therefore stop in this square to celebrate the fact that they were still alive. Djemma el Fna starts out exciting and finishes off wild! Storytellers, acrobats, snake charmers, water sellers, musicians, magicians and just about any other form of entertainment you can think of.Love it or loathe it, Djemaa el Fna has to be experienced at least once. And I say 'experienced' rather than 'seen' because Djemaa el Fna needs all the senses - tasting the food, smelling the spices and aromas, and hearing the endless noise of the horns."

During the day the square is full of orange juice carts, snake charmers, horse and carts and monkey's. I am completely against using animals for tourism so for me that was already a no no. The monkeys looked distressed, flinched when their owners moved, were chained up in the heat and looked bored and distressed.The horses stood in the heat all day (45 degrees when we were there) had poorly fitted shoes, scars on their bodies, and were under weight. When you come from a country with great animal welfare rules it becomes very evident when animals are not being cared for properly. If you're reading this please don't feed the animal trade."

            "review": "Approach with caution. The negative comments in reviews about this area are all thoroughly justified. My own particular experience was extremely upsetting. On arriving with my teenager daughter we were quickly targeted by a group of 3 henna women. My daughter often has henna designs done when in the Middle East and was keen to get one done here. The woman who was leading proceedings would not give us a price but said we could pay what we wanted. She showed my daughter a book of designs without prices. She spent about 3 or 4 minutes carrying out the design and I gave her the equivalent of 8 euros which I felt was fair. She then produced an identical book of designs but this time with prices alongside which were about 30 euros. A long and unpleasant argument ensued during which all 3 women rounded on us. They grabbed my daughter by the arm a number of times and told her to tell me to pay more. She was becoming upset at this stage and just wanted me to pay up so we could go. In the end I gave them about 15 euros and we managed to extricate ourselves and walk away at which point the ringleader shouted '**** you' at my daughter who by this stage was in tears. She was badly shaken and just wanted to return to the hotel.We also fell foul of trying to take a photo without realising we would have to pay and yet again it was an aggressive woman who shouted that if we wanted to take a photo we would have to 'pay good money'. A few days later we were the victims of a friendly young man who offered to point out directions in the souk and would not take no for an answer. He insisted on taking us to his family's pharmacy but there was not anything we wanted to buy there, unsurprisingly. He asked for money and I gave him the equivalent of a couple of euros and he became unpleasant, saying it wasn't enough.As a mother and daughter visiting without my husband we were easy targets. People may well think we were naive and gullible, and to some extent maybe we were. I have had years of dealing with pushy shop owners in Karama in Dubai, but this made Karama look like Westfield. I don't think I am a pushover, but I really did feel this was all a little too edgy to be enjoyable.My advice would be to keep your wits about you, dress conservatively (as we did), remove jewellery and watches beforehand and spend a little time reading about the most common scams in Marrakech before visiting. The square is certainly vibrant, lively and interesting but approach with caution and see it as a one-off experience. Marrakech has much more to offer; we particularly enjoyed Les Jardins Majorelle."

But I didn't want to support that; I don't know if the monkeys are well treated or simply used to make money- like the horses. We had a guide but if we hadn't, we would have been over run with vendors and hustlers. Henna artists, fortune tellers, stalls serving goat brains with the meaty goat skulls hanging in front, people dancing, people watching people dancing, balloon sellers, jugglers- you name it.

My boyfriend and I have been travelling around Morocco now for about 3 weeks and decided we wanted to do Marrakech properly and stay in a Riad and soak up the atmosphere. Jemaa el Fna is a 5 minute walk from where we are staying so we have experienced it during the day and at night. For people who believe this is culture and the real Morocco I suggest going anywhere but here to find out what it is really about. There is nothing authentic about it. Snake charmers drug them first and remove their teeth then hit them if they do not go in the direction they want them to go in. Men are dragging monkeys around in chains. Kicking them when they pull against it. Some have nappies on. I saw one in the afternoon as I passed that was soiled and when passing through again later the same nappy was on. My boyfriend took a picture of the general square and then one of the dancers came up to him demanding money. When we said no he became aggressive and squared up to him and started shouting at him. Luckily he is not intimated very easily. This happened on numerous occasions during the night. The locals seem a lot more aggressive here than anywhere else we have been. Regardless of whether you give them something or not it is never enough for them. Women beware - I was approached for a henna tattoo. Repeatedly told them I did not want one whilst trying not to be rude. I went to talk to my boyfriend and they grabbed my hand and rushed a tattoo on it then tried demanding 300 dirham (about 20 quid) for it. I only had bigger notes on me and they would not leave until they got something which ended up being 100 dirham for shoddy work that I did not want or need. Even the women get aggressive here!! Much nicer places to see in Marrakech such as the palaces and the museums. If you are an animal lover do not go here. If you do want to visit I suggest you be prepared and be on the defensive when approached by anyone. this place is not culture it's a circus and an awful one at that!!"

Dress respectfully and you won't get as much hassle - this is a muslim country after all so be wary of their culture.The food stalls at night are an attack on your senses and you could eat pretty much anything you wanted too - including sheep's heads! Orange juice from the sellers during the day is so refreshing and delicious.Definitely worth a visit and a great place to experience the almost none stop bustle and noise - but lovely to get away from it too and see the peaceful gardens of the city."

If you are a western tourist you will be a magnet for good and bad attention. If you like a performance it's easiest to give a little money at the start so you can stand and watch for a while and take photos without being targeted. The food stands are also good but the salesmen can be intense. You get less hassle if you smile sweetly as you say no thank you (\"la shukran\") and take it with good humour."

It's a nice place to be at start but my poor ratings is because of the hassle you get from the shop and stall owners, if you just glance at the shop they all over you and won't leave you a sec on your own. Shame they don't understand that actually if they leave you alone you might look at the stuff and even buy something. I bought nothing.The other thing is beware of the guys with monkeys and snakes. Don't take a photo of them cause they'll charge you for it. They will throw the monkey on your shoulder to force you take a photo, don't let them, just say no.I would recommend the horse and carriage ride though, the driver was very nice and helpful, he showed us around and even stopped in places so we can take photos, they will jump on you to take their carriage for a ride but don't be put off by it, it's worth the ride and the experience."

NB We were there during Eid so it might be different at other times.By day it's orange juice sellers, stalls selling random stuff and people touting photos with animals. My advice - drink the juice it's fab (choose the place by the way the person makes you laugh), ignore the sellers ( there are many better in the Souks) and avoid the animals. Spend some time in a roof top cafe and soak up the atmosphere.By night it's different - loads of food on offer. There's got to be a risk but it looked ok so we went for it. Every type of Moroccan food is on offer. Usual method of selection (after general appearance) was the amount they made me smile. As ever agree the price first but then just go for it. If your instinct is to fight the place, you won't win so go home or better still keep smiling and tag along for the ride."

However, do take caution of your belongings in 2009 my partner had her mobile taken from her bag. Saying that items are stolen all over the world and this did not deter us. An eve here can be magical/mystical what with incense burning, snake charmers, and the general ambience. Bartering to purchase is top of the menu and we experienced one very young (14/15 yrs old) trader who turned out to be quite rude; I asked him to understand respect and other older traders agreed with me. The souks/alley ways can be a challenge especially when hot (mostly is in summer), and a tour guide book is useful. Definitely recommend when you feel confident - getting lost and working your way out through browsing and trying to navigate. Allow plenty of time for this kind of trip. Some amazing sights, smells and experiences to be had. Plenty of water required to hydrate, but many shops sell it. Be prepared to be targeted by locals especially the ones keen on getting their hands on your cash. This is a 3rd world culture (so we are seen as having money). However, a majot benefit of Morocco (Marrakech) is it's very close to home (UK), yet guarantees the weather unlike travelling into Europe which can be a longer flight and weather still unpredicatable. Bear in mind Marrakech is a City so no beach here yet a trip to Essaouira (pronounced 'essa-weera', or 'es-Sweera' in Arabic), on the West coast and about a 2 hr drive away, is well worth a visit/stay. We stayed here in Feb 2009 for 4 nights, having driven in a hire car from Marrakech and located accommodation with ease unplanned. I could say more and will another time as got to go out..............TBC......."

Beware though, if you pause for too long to admire or wonder at anything you will soon find a snake or monkey being draped over you or your hand being decorated with henna...for which you then have to barter a deal for something you didn't ask for in the first place.

Full of people and yes most of them are trying to get your money one way or another but just chill and don't take it too seriously. Enjoy the food at the stalls (number 15 is good) but they will pile everything on your table (at a cost of course). Watch out for the Monkey men who will literally throw the monkeys at you and then charge you 300 dirhams and the henna ladies that jump you and start painting you before you even have a chance to say hi. To avoid this grab a drink at one of the many cafes and sit back and people watch and take loads of photos. Don't forget to haggle when buying anything its all part of the game, even with the taxi drivers that will try and rip you off. Most of all have fun."

During the day time it has some stalls selling freshly squeezed orange juice which is delicious and very cheap, but probably best avoided if you have a dodgy tummy like my family & I had. When walking through it you are constantly harassed by women trying to do henna tattoos on your hands. They grabbed both my daughters and started drawing despite us all saying No. In the end we had to pay \u20ac20 and \u20ac15 for two awful tattoos which my girls hated. Then you are up against the snake charmers who walk up to you and try to put snakes around your neck despite you telling them a firm No and walking in the opposite direction. The worst thing we encountered was guys with poor monkeys on chains and dragging them around to catch tourists for photo opportunities. The monkeys were trying to hold the chain to stop the men from pulling them too hard. It was horrible cruelty and I can't imagine any decent tourist paying these people. At night the square is cleared and all the food sellers come out. They set out little cooking areas and have tables, seats where you can eat very cheaply. We were totally ripped off at Stall 34/118 and had a horrible experience (see separate review). We spent 5 days in Marrakech and this square was our least favourite part so would only recommend that you visit it once or twice purely as an observer - a very shrewd one at that."

They will all approach you and try to get you to buy/take photos or pet their goods/animals. The snake charmers are the worst..... stay well away. These men are overly agressive and look for large amounts of money if you take photos or express any interest at all. The best way is to just ignore them completely! Don't be a push over either... stand your ground and don't let them take advantage. Don't be afraid to say no and walk away. The same applies to the street performers. ... If you don't want to pay then don't express any interest. Haggling is expected.... don't be afraid to push it a little to get the price you want. ***TIP,dont get a taxi in the square itself.

One example was a henna girl who grabbed my gf's wrist and in seconds, chanting \"gratuit, gratuit!\" Had done a haphazard henna on her hand, and then a group of them appeared refusing to release her unless I paid them. Lost all faith in Moroccan people."

It was sad the amount of animal cruelty there was. For shopping, I'd say try your luck in the souks instead. The square is really amazing at night when dining tents are put up. You can get a meal for two for under 10 euro and the food is really good. I know it might seem like unsanitary street food, but that dining area was one of the highlights of Marrakech. There's also freshly squeezed orange juice that I recommend too."

We stayed in the Palmeraie district of the city, just outside Marakkech Old town. I was aware that the locals used horses and donkeys as their livelihood but nothing could prepare me for what I witnessed when we got to Jmaa El Fnaa. Monkeys being dragged around with chains wrapped around their necks, Donkeys and horses being forced to cart tourists around that weighed far more than the poor animals themselves. Constant and brutal whipping of the animals in clear view of the tourists, one example of when one Man stood next to his horses and just whipped them as hard as he could, the poor things screaming in pain and trying to get away. It was a scorching hot day (40 Celcius) and I didn't see any of the horses offered water or shade, I personally witnessed a cyclist collide at full speed with some horses and the poor things being used as battering rams for cars, trucks, lorries etc. to push themselves through busy traffic. Blatent and barbaric animal cruelty. I would insist that anyone with any ounce of compassion or empathy towards animals not to promote this business by riding one of the carts, or even visiting this place. You can't get away from it, from the minute you enter Marakkech until you leave."

Marrakech has been for many years the boho/chic city of choice for many and believe me all girls will have seen many articles of expensive boutique hotels and exotic things to do which women seem to really go for. These could be fine if you have a tonne of cash (see caveat 1) and I mean a tonne in gold at least. Caveats:1. Money: Basically if I had a tonne of gold to burn on a holiday I would go somewhere nice for starters. Marrakech just isn\u2019t nice. Burn your hard earned in nice surroundings. What the glossy mags show and what is reality are poles apart and this is an extreme example of that;2. Hustlers: It has millions upon millions of hustlers and they will get aggressive at some stage;3. Tourists: It has millions upon millions of tourists cheek by jowl and you will get aggressive at some stage wishing to kill the offensive hustlers trying to sell you garbage at prices 10x that of London;4. Tat: They are always hustling the tourists and the souk (meaning market) is Africa\u2019s largest souk selling exclusively tat/garbage/tourist trinkets and all at exorbitant prices. You get hustled even for breathing;5. Rip Off: The cost of everything is more than London even after haggling. London here I live is expensive but not as expensive as this hole of dirt;6. Food: The food is merely \u201cOK\u201d but far better in any western city that I have been to. You are highly likely to get very very sick if you eat anything in this city. Frankly I can cook better. The best restaurants are an absolute joke apart from the bill which is like swanky London;7. Drinking: Hard to find anywhere serving alcohol and is usually at rip off prices.Marrakech may have been nice once. It is a dump now and absolute dump and it depressed me how awful it was. I did some nice things but I have to look very hard. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."

Personally I didn't enjoy having my arm grabbed and having henna done without requesting to do so, nor did I enjoy having to constantly dodge men putting snakes, monkeys, and smelly traditional hats on me for the privilege of having to pay to remove them.Some of the stuff on the markets are interesting, but this soon fades upon wandering further into the souks, where everything is identical to the previous stall and the diversity of goods is non-existent.I would advise a visit so you can say you've been and who knows, you may love it, but my suggestion is to go in with low expectations and if you're scared of snakes/don't want to catch rabies off a monkey, stay WELL away."

I carried my money in a body bag and always felt safe. Make some time to wonder around and absorb the cultural life of Marrakech, you won't be disappointed at all."

Not to mention the terrifying monkeys and emaciated horses with no water to drink. The food market in the evening is good and the mountains of snails are impressive as is the atmosphere there. However when you stray away from the lights of the stalls it is dark and a strange mixture of people trying to sell you drugs, beggars and a bus playing dance music. Still a good place to get a taxi elsewhere but agree a price before you get aboard.Overall it seems like it might once have been full of mystery and magic, but now it is a tourist trap and not a fun one."

There was a great atmosphere then but I think it would have been better later when people were buying from the food stalls. What I am saying is that it is great to visit any time but later in the day is probably best. There are plenty of cafes around the square where you can go up to the first floor, if you buy a drink, and look down on the square which I enjoyed more than anything. I took a video on my camera and playing it back here in England seeing the sights and the sounds makes me very nostalgic."

It is perfectly safe, and it is full of locals enjoying the street food and street attractions. Just keep in mind that almost any interaction with the locals will be followed by an expected small payment depending on what the interaction was. There are people with monkeys that you can hold and pet and take pictures with, for that you would pay about 20-30 Dh (about 2-3 USD). There are also people doing street performances or selling stuff. They will always ask for much more than they expect to get, so you have to haggle. To get back to your hotel, again, it is better to haggle with the taxi driver, and to agree on a price before getting on the taxi. A fair price for the ride if you are staying in the hotel area is generally around 30-50 Dh (3-5 USD), but of course they will initially ask for more: if they don't budge, you can walk away and look for a different taxi.The rule of thumb is: ask for the price first, then haggle until you get to a fair price (keeping in mind that they will initially ask for much more than they are willing to sell it for, generally about 3 times, sometimes up to 10 times more), and then do the transaction and pay for it. If you accept a service before agreeing on the price, you will pay much more than necessary."

By day the souks are great. If you dont mind lengthy, often sociable and good humoured haggling then you will have a great time shopping.Be warned, the Morrocans are master sales people and will employ every technique in the book to get you to buy something you dont want for a price greater than you are willing to pay,dont be intimidated or feel bamboozled ,just get into the swing of it and stand your ground,a good bit of ruthless haggling on my part earned me many a handshake,rather than causing offence.Please dont have your photo taken with the monkeys,they are not treated well and without the participation of tourists ,hopefully this will end.I travelled with another female friend and felt safe day and night.I was relieved as i had read that it wasnt the safest place for female travellers to be.A trip out into the mountains is a must,a cab really isnt that much ,and unlike bus tours you can stop where you want along the way."

You can't go to Marrakesh without visiting the souks; leave your map in your room ( probably not acurate anyway ) and just walk; part of the enjoyment is getting a little lost, don't worry, there are plenty of people around who will gladly point you back in the right direction and if you need to give someone 10 or 20d then in the scheme of things that actually isn't a lot.

We stayed as \"out of towners\" at the Palmeraie so dipped our toes into the chaos whenever we fancied after short taxi rides into Marrakech. Not for the faint hearted, and if you are an inexperienced traveller, you may find many of the practices and goings on quite abhorrent...... until you look a little closer. (I'll explain later) Mostly I take things as they are, and respect the culture of the locals, especially if it isn't directly affecting me, or not to my personal taste. We went for the \"vanilla option\" on our initial foray and wandered around the touristy bit, haggling, enjoying the deals and following the \"international haggling formula of course\", looking at all the snake charmers and story tellers and henna artists. A few cups of tea/coffee at various locations around the square, (not missing out on a freshly squeezed orange juice- absolutely sublime!) Back into the fray more haggling. Then escape out of the madness for a glass of vino at the hotel.On following visits late afternoon and night-time we realised there's a rhythm to the place. Everyone has an area, the hawkers come round like clockwork, the police patrols just as regular, the street beggars on a circuit too. Then the nightmarket foodstalls are cleaned off and scrubbed and assembled in the square, and then there's puffs of smoke and the food market becomes alive. Even if the light is failing you cannot fail to find it due to the smells of cooking wafting everywhere.If street level is too much for you, make your way up to the rooftops and the cafes and restaurants overlooking the square. We stopped at a few but the best view and mint tea and coffees and fruit shakes we had was in the Brasserie Aqua, and in my estimation the best view of the square, great service and a good friendly chat.Leaning over the balcony, removed from the hustle (literally) and bustle of the plage, you can kick back, enjoy the view over the rooftops, never seen more satellite dishes, and the watch the world go by in the square, the only thing I've ever seen in my life that's similar is an old Attenborough documentary about bees in the hive, passing signals, interacting and generally buzzing about.

Be aware of the actions of some, and it is the minority, but a polite \"no\" always seemed to work for us!! The whole square changes early evening with the food market starting, the smell is so good :-). A lovely place to be; do be careful of some locals but make sure you enjoy every visit to this square."

Having read other reviews before our trip, we knew that we would have to visit both by day and by night.At night the food market comes alive (not open during the day at all) serving all sorts of local delicassies including sheep brains. It is a riot of colour and excitement as, somewhat like covent garden but a little more atmospheric, in the square performers gather crowds around them, Please note, if you take a photo you are likely to be pursued for a tip, and all those we saw had performers speaking in french or arabic.Meanwhile by day there are a few snake charmers performing under umbrellas and fortune tellers, but i really wouldn't make a special trip to see it. It is likely you will walk through it or onto it whilst visiting the souks or the nearby mosque, so don't make a special trip"

Whilst walking around it your trying to take it all in and have a look at what people are selling but the experience is tainted by very loud sellers constantly trying to talk to you and get your attention and always having to watch where your going so that - 1. your not standing on someone merchandaise -2. your not knocked down by a horse and carriage/ speeding motorbikes ..which are everywhere -3.so you dont go near performers or people with animals to take pictures so they dont make you pay for something you didnt ask for -4. so you dont bash into people ( which there are plenty of ) and get your bag stolen. one of the women selling henna even came up to me and grabbed my hand and she wouldnt let go .... and at that stage i was getting quite cranky . its a bit overwhelming at times ... as well as being uncomfortable. At night it does look very pretty ... but i wouldnt recommend bringing younger children here it would just be chaotic, im a teenager and at times even i felt intimidated and didnt want to get lost and was very conscious of being stolen from. But one tip is to actually have a look if you can at what the people who are coming up to you in cafes/restaurants are trying to sell to you ... i got la vie est belle which is usually 80 euro for 30 euro and it was perfect condition/quality ... :)"

You cannot even look at things in the square without people touching you and harassing you to buy something. We went here once and did not return. Definitely do not take any pictures as someone 500 yards away will come up to you and tell you you owe them money for the picture you just took. Stay away from the snake charmers as they will put a snake on your neck, demand you take a picture, and then demand a payment. Keep your money in your front pocket. If someone tells you a street is closed, they are lying to you, and are trying to get you lost, then they will magically \"appear\" to get you un-lost for a heavy fee.

I take you there... Big Square Yes? Small Fee? Probably not.All roads lead to the Big Square/La Place/Djmaa el Fna. Even some roads that don't. We realised this once we left our Riad as everybody tried to direct us to the square or even better take us there for a small fee (or was that the Small Square for a Big fee?). Best advice for anywhere in Marrakech - know where you are going. Take the map your hotel will have given you. If in doubt a shop like an art gallery or similar will give you honest directions that won't take you to someone's brother's riad/rugshop/spiceshop - you may have to browse for a couple of minutes though. Once you reach the square, the sounds of snake charmers horns and the smell can be quite overwhelming. Some people find it less than charming, especially during the day, but like a moth to a flame, I was drawn in. The square is quite amazing - we saw snake charmers with flutes, and drums blaring, monkeys on leads (really?), people walking around in colourful costumes making more noise, henna tattooists dead keen on marking up clean skins (with or without permission) and of course, the ubiquitous orange juice stalls. These are a must - just 4dh a glass (about 40 euro cents) what a steal. At the moment Marrakech is in the grip of an early season heatwave with temps in the mid 40s, so we did a lap and headed back into the souks - they are covered and considerably cooler. We returned later in our Marrakech stay to see it by night (last time we saw it was a couple of years ago). We headed along when dusk was falling and the square was coming alive(er). The food stalls were all spruiking like crazy - look out for a laugh at No. 13 - \"We have pool, air conditioning and 3 year no diarrhoea guarantee!\" - we weren't there for food, just the atmosphere. Smoke in the air, hypnotic drumming, snakes, monkeys, henna, and the sun setting and sending rays of light up behind the clouds - quite magic actually."

In Marrakech - follow these tips and u will have a great time!Prepare!Prior to your visit in Morocco apply for a halifax clarity card, as this provides you with free cash machine withdrawals. The currency booths in the airport have very long queues and are very bothersome. You also get a much better rate withdrawing straight from the clarity card. we got 15.7 DH/GBP when locally 14.7/GBP was the best we could find. Brush up on your French, as knowing the local lingo will provide you with better opportunities. Download the offline version of trip advisor, it has an excellent map of the city. Download the Google translator app.Download the currency converter plus app.Do's:Aeroport/airport. You are required to complete a passenger form when arriving AND departing, these can be found in the terminal. There are NO cash machines in airport, we asked our taxi driver who drove us to one.Pre-arrange an airport transfer with your hotel/riad..Getting around: don't be scared and use the bus, although it is busy, it is very cheap and costs 4 dirhams. We used it daily as do the locals, often we were the only tourists on the bus! Which was a novelty.Most buses end at jeema el fna, ask your hotel or riad if you are not located in the medina which bus number you need to take. Haggle with the taxi driver BEFORE you get into it. Pay 25-30 dirhams in the day maximum, be firm.if u choose to travel via taxi (make sure it is a petit taxi -Peugeot and Dacias- for 3 passengers or less) be prepared to haggle, if you don't haggle they will charge you lots of dirhams. The most we were quoted was 80 dirham in Gueliz. We managed to get the price down to 40.Grand Taxi's are more expensive and are double the price of a petit taxi, these are normally older Mercedes cars. Fnaa Square:Keep an eye out for Katooba mosque, very tall pillared building, this means u are near Jem El Fnaa square if your struggling to find it. Eat at number 32 (Hassan) in Fnaa square, lots of international people eat here as well as locals, we recommend a big sausage meal and the mixed kebab. You can have a veritable banquet for the price of a McDonald's back in the UK. You will find Hassan with huge plumes of smoke that come from his BBQ we ate here without any problems at all. Afterwards, Sit in a terrace cafe to take in the view/atmosphere. Terraced cafes are usually 25 dirhams per person entrance fee which includes a drink, you can try haggling and some are successful although we weren't! The view is worth 50 dirhams to see sunset over the square and kotouba mosque.Haggle in the fnaa square in the day time, it is a lot quieter and less pressure. Only show interest/browse if you are actually buying. Haggle 1/4 of the price they start off with. Be firm and to seal the deal by walking away,...give them your best price...., your only price.We were given a starting price for a large leather bag at 1500 dirhams, my partner got the price down to 300 dirhams!!There are Many cash machines as u enter the fnaa square. We recommend visiting the square at least 3 times to get to grips with it all as it can be quite intimidating at first. Visit the KFC opposite the fnaa square for some air con and respite. Be aware that the locals see white folk/tourists as a huge walking dollar sign, it is a big game to them so do not be taken advantage of. Walk with a purpose and take the bargaining in good humour, realistically you may only be arguing over a couple of pounds but it will be a huge difference to the locals! If you are buying something have a look and decide what you're prepared to pay and barter from there! Don't:Drink the orange juice in the fnaa square as it is watered down and will make you ill, (it wiped me out for 1 whole day!) Do not make eye contact with people who are trying to sell you henna, monkey and snake photos as they see that as an opportunity to lure you in for a photo and then ask you for large amounts of money. Work out before how much u are willing to pay, we paid 100 dirhams for cobra/ snake photos even tho they wanted 300, Just pay when you have had your photos taken and then firmly walk away. Obviously if you don't want the photo don't approach, we thought it was quite novel and worthwhile. Don't follow a stall holder to his 'factory' down the alley ways. Try to stick to a wall in the medina, if you have a good sense of direction you will be okay. If not allow a few hours and you will pop out somewhere, although it may not be where you started. Do not let the taxi driver take you to his friends shop, be firm about your end destination. For info, Petit and grand taxis do not have air con.VisitsGet to Jardin Majorelle early as it is popular and gets very busy inside. Inside you can find the gardens revived by Yves Saint Laurent after he purchased the site in a state of disrepair. The colours, plants and architecture are a real testament to design and you should allow a couple of hours to soak in the atmosphere. At the time of writing there was an excellent Berber display in the museum that is well worth visiting even though it's small, we found it fascinating. The total cost for museum and gardens is 75dh per person. We were recommended to visit the palaces by an Australian couple who we met but unfortunately we did not manage to go."

We had people try and sell us hats watches lunch , etc but as soon as you decline their offer they politely leave you alone. No one oversteps and it is an atmosphere that is undescribable in words. Truly magical. The smell of fresh nougat and the leather and the orange juice all mixed in with the heat and the friendliness makes it an experience you will never forget. Go now! Or regret it forever! We loved it there"

            "review": "Eye-opener but READ MY HINTS AND TIPS!!. This place is quite an eye-opener, especially at night. The place is buzzing, filled with market traders, food stalls, snake charmers, musicians, and so on. The food is very cheap indeed, and good value for money. I stayed here for four days and didn't get any tummy upsets, so don't be afraid to try the cuisine.The few things that did disappoint and/or anger me, are:WALKING THROUGH THE SOUKS: These are a maze of avenues filled with stalls selling everything from leather goods, wooden ornaments, spices, shoes, and so on. However, the constant hassle from the traders is tiresome. Us Brits like to walk around shops, picking up items, inspecting goods and generally having a good nose, but the minute you show any interest in any of the wares, you end up being hassled. And the traders will try and sell the goods at a silly price, so go in at one-third of what they ask and hopefully you'll meet in the middle.FRIENDLY 'GUIDES' - On the first day, a chap zoomed up to us on his moped and said he recognized us from our hotel. So as not to be rude, we shook hands and spoke. This was a mistake. From then on, he was like a limpet, and he ordered us a taxi to the kasbah where obviously he had friends with a herbal pharmacy who tried to rip us off! In the end I gave him 100 Dirhams to leave us alone (about \u00a37), but it was worth it. He even lied to us, saying the souks were closed - and they weren't we later discovered, as they never close! In a way, I am glad I had the experience as it gives me something to remember, but I felt angry that he hoodwinked us.THE TANNERY - this is worth a look, even though the place stinks. However, again, we had a 'friendly guide' who said we couldn't go round it without one, and at the end wanted 200 Dirhams (about \u00a314). And he took us into the 'cooperative' shop there where again we felt compelled to buy things we didn't want. These guides tend to be your best friend until after you pay them, when they go quiet and disappear like a f*rt in the wind!BEGGING: There are a lot of beggars in Marrakesh. Each day I gave coins to a seemingly downtrodden person, but don't go giving to everyone otherwise you run out of money.ANIMAL WELFARE: If you're like me and love animals, you will see some sad sights. There are many stray cats that look like skin and bones, and the donkeys that are used to pull carts look slake with thirst. I also don't like seeing monkeys and snakes being used for shows.SHORTS: Some travel guides state that because Morocco is a Moslem country, that you should not wear shorts. Don't believe a word of it. Many, many people wear shorts there, including the locals!!"

Very characteristic are the souks although we owr best buys, in terms of quality and price, were actually outside the Medina, in the new town, or on the way to the Atlas.The Moroccan people that we got to know during the trip was friendly and courteous and we spent beautifull days.We obviously made a couple of visits at the famous square of Marrakech, Djemaa el Fna, and we really surprised in a negative sense that this square was so praised by previous reviews and by travel stories. Even more we were surprised that this place enjoys the attention of UNESCO. If there was something traditional in this square I'm sure now it losts everything, it is more a concentration of swindlers and underhanded street vendors. I suggests definitely a step in the square to get to know all of Marrakech, but do not buy from people that animate it; I think it's the only place in Morocco that until now I have been disappointed in terms of discomfort and brutality of the people I met."

Even if you just want to look at the amazing snake charmers or monkeys there is a great chance that you`ll have to pay for it. Like my friend wanted to take a picture with snake.. He went to a charmer and asked how much it would cost, but the man just put snake on his shoulders and took him to where more snakes were.. I started to take pictures with them. In a short while I felt snake on my shoulders as well and even though I immediately told him to take it off, it wouldn`t help.. After that we were both asked to pay for it and as I refused the snake charmer just squeezed the snake tighter around my neck! I said ok, I will pay just take it off, but I didn`t and the man was angry. He asked, I think, for about 80 euros from my friend and from me, but we ended up paying him 20 or 30 and even than the angry charmer was shouting as we walked away.. So my advice would be enjoy the market, but keep your eyes open and say \"No\" before it is too late :)"

Most of the shops lining the square sell the same products as down in the souk, but the men are so arrogant that I avoid shopping here. I might buy tasselled keyrings, which make a good souvenir and a large bag with a funny camel to pack my shopping. Jemaa el Fna is full of restaurants with rooftop terraces, this time I liked to take my lunch at Tajin Darna, which serves a cool and fresh salad nicoise.At sundown the food court comes to life serving mainly the same things, meat or vegetable skewers, grilled aubergines, peppers, tasty small sausages, salad marocaine with tomatoes and finely chopped onion. The whole circus is right beside, snake charmers, dancing dervishes, monkeys and simple games. Watch your belongings!"

And many stalls will give you a plastic cup and straw helping to allay any fears of the dreaded tummy bug!Go with an open mind. The Jemaa El Fna is a once in a lifetime experience. It IS Marrakech"

But, buyer beware, ask before you take any photos otherwise it will cost you 300 dirham. There are monkeys on leashes, people playing music, places to get henna, psychics, all that one can imagine. The square is filled with locals looking to make a dollar, or dirham for that matter, off of strange, and unique talents. It is a sight to be seen. There is even the occasional boxing match in the square. The festivities come to life as the sun sets.Beware of the scammers and pick pockets as your eyes will surely dart from one attraction to the next. The area is teaming with locals and tourists.There are also many food stalls, all with numbers. They will try to entice you to dine at their \"restaurant\". I ate in a few of them and they were quite nice. Very inexpensive street food. There are also many juice vendors. Orange juice is 4 dirham, everything else is 10 driham. If it is too crowded and you just want to observe, there are some cafes that overlook the square and have balconies. You must purchase to get a view, but the cost of a beverage is worth the amazing views."

However, the store keepers are only interested in relieving tourists of all their money, often misleading visitors on prices. You really need to banter (50%) of any thing on offer. There were plentiful food at the square, if you are game, often more tasteful than main restaurants.Lots of music, dancing and display of performing artists. Loved the atmosphere but concerned about security. Not for the faint hearted."

I honestly enjoyed watching the square when it started to be empty at 7.30am and then during lunch and then at 5pm. Watching the contrasts change so quickly was amazing! I sadly have to give this square 3 stars as I was very sad to see monkeys in chains as one of their main attractions! I have read about them on reviews here on TA but seeing them in person really made me sad. I was also trapped by one of the women walking around giving henna tattoos. I was taking photos and she just grabbed my arm and said, allow me to give a welcome gift to you. After a few seconds later, she asks me for payment aka my gift back. For some people, this may be quite a negative experience. In fact, alot of the locals I met, even tour guides are very embarrassed by their fellow Moroccans with this kind of behaviour. I just laughed at her and gave her a few coins. I even bid her goodluck as other tourists aren't so accommodating as I could be...sometimes! Haha!"

It's a vast open space filled with people selling everything from orange juice to watches. The water sellers, dressed in strange and colourful costume, are intriguing but don't try and photograph them or they will harass you for money. In fact, don't bother taking a camera at all, as the chances of using it are slim unless you're willing to pay for every shot you take. Snake charmers, musicians, henna tattooists are all after your money and you need to steel yourself. Monkeys on chains will dance for the crowds at the order of their owners, which I found disturbing. We walked through the place as quickly as possible to escape the harassment. Head for the souks instead, they are actually much less stressful! Or visit one of the balconied restaurants that surround the square and view it from the periphery."

And part of the love is the Jemaa as Fna and its sheer insanity and otherworldliness. During the day find every type of entertainment (always for a tip) from trained monkeys to colorful water sellers, to storytellers (you won't understand a word, but watching the locals is part of the fun),to dancers, to cobra snake charmers (once our guy charmed 6 cobras at once!). I really believe this place was an inspiration for several Star Wars scenes. Go ahead and give a few dirham for tips and you will enjoy your pictures forever. Don't miss the tooth seller - a mound of human teeth available at any size,to replace any you may have lost along the way!! And go at night when it transforms to lots of outdoor restaurants. We shied away from this on the first couple trips, but jumped in at trip 3 and found out what we had been missing. A great meal at a bargain price and the atmosphere of the locals is wonderful. Everyone is your best friend. During the day just beware the henna ladies - if given the slightest chance they will adorn you with henna tattoos that will last for weeks (whether you want it or not) before you know it and then demand payment."

Severely lacking in any flavour, one single piece of meat in the meat couscous and dried out chicken stuck into a traditional shaped pot and passed off as a tagine. Also, I've seen bigger chunks of meat in a packet of Felix than appeared on a skewer presented to us as a kebab! Take the advice of others, mooch about, soak up the atmosphere avoiding the henna ladies and then go eat in a restaurant!"

Jemaa El Fna is the epicentre of the Medina, which in it'self is the middle of Marrakech. Whether you travel in from North, East, South or West, all roads, paths and alley ways lead to El Fna.It is like stepping back in time, or looking at historical production. Sure, there are new cafes and restaurants which overlook the square, but they are merely a vantage point for what lays below.The square is packed with locals and tourists alike, snake charmers are common place, monkeys on chains and Cal\u00e8ches line the street waiting to show you around the city.You will notice some orange covered stalls, they may not look up to much, but these are where you should head for food around El Fna at night. On the subject of food, the nearby cafes are good for a drink to view the square, but do not eat around here unless you try the stalls, the food in the restaurants is very poor indeed. To the north of El Fna the souks can be found where you can buy anything and everything.When you come away from this place, you may take any number of thoughts with you, ranging from 'what an interesting spectacle', to 'how can people still live like this', one thought that everyone shares though, is that you can't say you've done Marrakech, without witnessing Jemaa El Fna."

Yes, you over pay for the one soda that you are required to buy when entering, but If you think of it as price to one amazing show, you will realize that you getting a deal. Before we knew it four hours had passed. It is the perfect place to watch the sun set and the square come alive with performers. My favorite time in the square was during the evening call to prayer when the action takes a break and the square is noticeably but only slightly more still. On the last day we visit we fully submitted to Jemaa el Fna and overpaid for photos with the snake charmers. Of course you are being ripped off but it was worth it for the experience.

These are a really fun way to have a meal and try some different food. After eating (or before), check out the various folk bands, dancers, boxing matches and other activities that appear at night.The only real downside is the stream of snake charmers, monkeys, ladies trying to henna you, horse drawn carriages, street stalls etc who are all trying to sell you something.

Avoid eating dinner at the restaurants directly overlooking the square as the quality for price leaves alot to be desired!

After coming from Fes I found it overcrowded with tourists, full of pushy store owners & scammers & full of dirty black smoke puking scooters.... We walked through the square during the day, it has the same old shops, drank a delicious fresh squeezed orange juice, ate some tasty food. Theres snake charmers, story tellers (not in english) people with monkeys on chains, including baby monkeys! it was actually horrible to see. We stopped to get a photo with this guy and his snakes when some veiled woman offered to take a pic of the two of us with the snakes, no problem. When she gave me back the camera she grabbed my hand and proceeded to squirt hena on it. I said no thanks and tried to pull back my hand back, but she had a good grip and told me \"its a gift\" so I reluctantly stood there furious that I had to go thru this ordeal. (The reason I let her was because we were told its rude to refuse a gift) So after she was done with the poor attempt of hena (it was really bad, just a big squiggly mess on my hand!), the first thing I did was look for somewhere I could wash it off! We started to walk off and thats when it all started.... she started asking for money for the hena. I said you said it was a gift.... blah blah blah... she was almost yelling and it was embarrassing! We gave her some money just so she would leave us alone (that's how they make their money). I went into a restaurant and washed it off immediately but it has already set in and I lived with that horrid souvenir for a good week. There were guys dancing around in the square that would cut you off and dance in front of you for all of 10 seconds and then put their hat out, we ignored the guy at first then he seriously told us we needed to pay him for his dancing. Needless to say he didn't receive any money or nice words from us, as we had just had our horrible hena experience! We came back that night to check out the food stalls because we wanted to try all the different food. Walking through the food stalls we were harassed so much, we couldn't even do one full lap to see everything first. Guys were grabbing us and pulling us toward their stalls. One guy put his arm over my one shoulder and his other hand on my other shoulder and turned me around so I wouldn't walk past his stall. That was the last straw for me, I spun out of his hold and made a big deal in front of everyone about him touching me like that. I can usually handle all the touts with smart comments and humor, but after the negative experiences from that day, my tolerance was low. I'd had enough of the B.S. and just decided to make a point in the hopes he would realize thats not how you get a tourists business!Keep in mind this review is just based on my personal experience. Im not condemning the place nor am I saying dont go there! Its something you have to experience! Just take all the info you read on these reviews and become a smarter traveler. Learn from other peoples experiences and know how to avoid the negative ones.It says below visited in May 2014, but we were actually there in Jan 2012.

It will be a marmite experience - you'll either love it or hate it. Personally I loved the noise, the sights, the crowds, the small huddles of locals playing games, singing, playing music and dancing. The 'street food' stalls all basically sell the same things - look on lots of youtube pages after searching for Jemaa el Fna. Stall number 1 is run by a lady called Aisha and the food here is cooked perfectly. She is clearly in charge of the chefs and waiting staff and watching her in action is an experience in itself - I would definitely return to her stall! I noticed she gets a mention in reviews going back quite a few years! Go Aisha!"

We were staying in a Riad fairly close to this square so walked through it several times during our stay. Although it was worth seeing as a totally full on sensory experience (interesting smelling food, noise of drums, hundreds of people trying to make a living from having their photo taken, selling bangles, henna tattoos etc), I didn\u2019t like it. Although everybody sees things from their own perspective and I realise that I shouldn't judge their method of making a living, I found seeing distressed looking monkey\u2019s pulled around on the end of chains, and snakes being exploited very upsetting, so not feeling I was in a position to challenge (although I thought about it), spent most of the time trying to avoid seeing them (& avoid being run over by the bikes & cars passing so close as although the locals seem to have excellent spacial awareness, I don't!). Having said that, it isn\u2019t to be missed as it\u2019s a huge part of the Marrakech \u2018adventure\u2019. Wanting to see what it was like at night, we found one of the rooftop caf\u00e9\u2019s and after a while, got a table where we could see over the square and for me was a better way of absorbing what was going on but with a bit of space. A word of warning \u2018though, we were told that the henna used in the square has a derivative than can cause skin to react. Also, the nice ladies coming up and \u2018giving\u2019 you a bracelet want something in return, so don\u2019t put one on unless you intend to buy one, which seems fair. Also worth remembering if you are going to take photos of the men in their twirly hats and other sights, then have some cash ready as for many this is their way of making a living."

If you don't like snakes give them a wide berth - you might end up with one around your neck! I have been told that the snakes have had their fangs removed but they can still spit and make you ill. Obviously this is the poisonous ones not the boa types. If you don't like monkeys avoid these too. They are chained and wear clothes and end up on your head or shoulders for the photo opportunity, which you pay them for.The water carriers, dressed in red also expect to be paid if you take their photo.There are stalls which sell delicious fresh orange juice and SEALED BOTTLED.WATER. I mention this because I have seen people filling water bottles out of containers to sell. DON'T buy if the seal is broken!There are fruit stalls and at certain times plant stalls but obviously you cannot buy them. Don't be tempted by the coconut sellers - looks great but they swill the coconut off with water from a container I would not like to hazard a guess as to there this comes from! There are always people who do henna tattoos but they can cause skin irritation and usually don't last. You can even buy the henna kits to do your own.They even have dentist stalls - this makes me grateful for our dental care lol!At night the square is totally transformed into a more manic area. This is a massive fast food extravaganza. If you eat here watch how they prepare the food first (hygiene wise) and if uncertain there are plenty more places to eat. The salads always concern me because you don't know how they have been washed. Use your common sense and you should be ok. Many people eat here - ask someone leaving the stall how they have found the food - people are always happy to help.If you walk around you will see boxing contests which can involve children, acrobats and many other entertainments."

Of course, it was nowhere near as bad as I had feared, although you do need to keep your wits about you. Unless you want to be photographed with a sad looking monkey in a dress on a lead, or a big snake, then keep well way from them and look only at a distance. Similarly, give the henna ladies a wide berth if you don't want a tattoo - although they never tried to grab my hand, despite many review saying they might.The stalls in the day are fairly typically full of the usual tat, with over-inflated prices and a hard sell. But if you just keep moving and ignore the attempts to make you buy, then you will be fine. I was wary of taking photos on the first day, but got braver as time went on, and never got any hassle. That said, I was careful about what I photographed, and always kept my phone and camera secure. We tried the orange juice from the stalls, and it was gorgeous and no upset tummy afterwards!In the evening, its a crazy manic bustle, with the food stalls all vying for your business. Its quite entertaining at first, but after a while it gets a bit wearing. All the stall holders will try anything to get your attention \"Rick Stein here, bl@@dy good food\", \"no diarrhoea guarantee\" and \"we all sell same sh@t\". In the end we ate at Stall 31 on two occasions, primarily because it was full of locals and there was a queue to eat there, so they did not need to pull tourists in with lame hooks. If you can turn a blind eye to the plate washing and don't worry about how the meat was stored etc, you may be fine. We ate food that was grilled and cooked in front of us, rather than cooked earlier and warmed up. It was cheap and cheerful - although the bill always came to more than we expected! Beware the cover charge of bread, olives, salad etc is not free and all adds up! Stall 14 is best for seafood. There are also loads of young lads with dessert trollies - a box of cakes that you choose yourself. We tried some - they were mostly dry and bland, but all part of the experience. It is busy and noisy in the square at night, but actually I didn't find it imtimidating. There are quite a few beggars, young children with their grannies etc and stall 31 very kindly gave uneaten leftovers (bread, salad, olives etc) to these beggars in a plastic bag.There are also lots of kids selling cheap toys, biscuits, cigarettes etc. You just need to be firm if you don't want to buy, and haggle them down if you do,Its a must see place, but exhausting after a while."

Even if you say no, they may still try to grab your hand and start anyway, when you still say no, they may ask you to pay for the henna they have used against your will. This happened to me and I stuck to my guns and wiped it off. But not all of them are like this. Some do understand, that no thankyou means no. There are snake charmers and men with monkeys. They are not keen for you take photos without payment. This I understand as they are trying to make a living. We had no trouble with this as we stayed away from these. The freshly squeezed orange juice is the best I have ever had. Amazing for 4 DH. The exchange rate for us was just under 15DH to the pound. In the evening the square gets very busy, with lots of hustle and bustle. The monkeys and some snake charmers are still around, but now we have the added street performers. More stalls appear selling traditional dress, argon oils, incense, etc etc etc. it's all very colourful and lively. People do beg and the sellers do try their hardest to get you to buy. Just be firm and politely decline offers to look for free. Nothing is free here. We found the final price we paid for things cheap (didn't buy anything we didn't think was a bargain, but our bargain Price may not be yours) . We paid about 60DH for argon oil, 100 DH for tradional trousers, we even found a tradional dress stall and bought them for 50DH. We ate at three different places around the square. Paid \u00a320 ish for 2 adult meals with non alcoholic drinks. Included mixed grill and tagine. Bargain ! We even tried sitting right in centre of the square on stall number 1. This seemed popular with locals and tourists , lots of long tables with everyone packed in. 3 course meal for 2 with water under \u00a315. All food excellent and no dicky stomach later. We stayed at the Meriem Hotel which was in the new part of the city. Prices for transport back from square. taxi 80DH, they charge for size of taxi. Ours was a big old merc. Horse and cart 200DH, Rickshaw style moped 50DH. The square is something to be experienced. I wouldn't say it was something everyone would enjoy. I wouldn't take my children, and being an animal lover not overly comfortable on the way animals are used. But I love the hustle and bustle, the smells and sounds, the overall atmosphere, the complete chaos. Somehow with everything going on around you I still managed to stay relaxed and calm and enjoy my moment in a city where not much makes sense and amongst the chaos there is some kind of order."

We were shepherded into the Tanneries where the stench was appalling so we headed back out. The whole place is intimidating and threatening as you're being offered \"the best price possible\" for the tack by in-your-face traders. There really was no fun in engaging in haggling here.This place is really not for the faint-hearted looking for holiday entertainment!Around five o'clock the night shift starts coming into the square. Gangs of youths pulling and pushing carts full of the various parts that they put together to make the food stalls. These teams have never heard of Food Hygiene Certificates. You take your life in your hands if you eat here in the evening. The snail sellers were serving up the poor creatures before their stalls had been fully erected. Deregulation at its extreme here. The nightmare continued as other stall holders appeared and the variety of foods increased. Where had it all been cooked? We left the food stalls and saw a large crowd gathered with uproarious cheering. On investigating we found a boxing circle where poor boys were being pitched against each other while the encircling crowd placed their bets. We found it distasteful. Again not for the faint-hearted so we left them all to it and searched for a civilised bar and a beer to help us get over it all!"

            "review": "A must in Marrakech, but.... The rest of the reviews pretty much spell out what to expect. I'll highlight a few tips: Visit the square at least three times: once in the morning to enjoy some fresh orange juice, once in the daytime to view some of the street performers (snake charmers, water servers, tooth pullers, etc) and once by night to eat at one of their multiple food stalls. Okay\u2026 you know you want a picture of that snake charmer\u2026 and it will cost you. The mere action of pointing your camera their way will cause them to immediately go your way and ask (better said demand) a tip. The trick of the trade here is to ALWAYS negotiate first. Negotiating the photograph of the snake charmer BEFORE you actually take the photograph will mean the difference between 30 - 50 dirhams and 300 dirhams (at least having them demand 300). Make sure the snake charmer is 100% agreeable that they are not taking a single cent more from you before you start shooting away. I actually went as far as clarifying the amount of shots I was planning on taking. Doing it this way actually makes the experience very enjoyable. Avoid the henna merchants in the square. This is normally a scam. If you do want a henna tattoo, negotiate first and decide on a fixed number and tattoo before they start. Do not accept a \"what ever you want to pay me\" offer. Make sure to walk around and see the different performers around the square at night. You will notice that many of them are geared more at the local crowd. This does not mean you can't participate (as long as you tip). Our best experience was actually with a group of Berber performers catering to the locals. We were even invited to sing in that performance! The group was very kind and welcoming (and so was the crowd). Last but not least, enjoy the local food stalls. Not only are they very cheap, but also delicious. I ate a little bit of everything and never got sick. Snails, teas, pastillas, kabobs, pastries and the fresh juice are a must!"

There are brightly dressed water sellers, juice and food stalls and the entrance to the souks. Little bands of musicians and story tellers too.

We recommend Chez Zazza and Kui Zin for eating, you can check these out on trip advisor, not much of a difference in price and way nicer than the stalls."

The Jemaa el-Fnaa was both a low point and a high point for my husband and I visiting Morocco on our honeymoon in Sept 2013 (happy Belated-Trip-Advisor-Review-Day to me!). You can\u2019t really miss walking through here at some point on a stay in Marrakesh, and why would you want to anyway? Well, I\u2019ll tell you why: because there are snakes. Everywhere. On the ground. And monkeys. On leashes, but they are still just hanging out and about, free as birds (there were no birds, that I recall BTW). Next thing you know Abu is chewing your face off like that crazy chimp here in Stamford a few years ago. So, you are walking and in the distance you\u2019ll see little groups of people and baskets on the ground. Under those baskets are cobras and some kind of other antidote-requiring serpent. I didn\u2019t get close enough to find out what kind of snakes they were. In fact, I made a point to walk in the farthest circumference possible from these mini-camps of reptile petting zoos I could. So far in fact, that while keeping an eye on the snake-stations in the distance, I\u2019d have my back to a monkey man who I was inadvertently creeping up on (or, was he creeping up on me?). Yikes! So, you have to distance yourself from the monkeys and snakes equally, all the while acting like you don\u2019t hear them calling out to you to, \u201ccome here little girl, these snakes are friendly!\u201d Yeah, right. I\u2019m from Texas where it\u2019s always a snake-show out the back door, except when you do see a snake, you don\u2019t go toward it. You run like h-e-double-hockey-sticks to the shed to get a hoe to, well, you know what comes next. My mother raised me right and therefore I have no interest in the basket snakes, the chained monkeys, the boxed Box Turtles (what\u2019s up with that!?), or any of the other creatures of Marrakesh. And don\u2019t think you can sneak a picture with your phone of this action because they will call out to you to tip them. So, I have a LOT of blurry, half-fingered covered pictures of this scene. My husband did talk to one of the no-so-charming snake charmers who said he\u2019d just gotten back from Orlando where he\u2019d worked at Disney as a snake charmer for a number of years. So, the irony there is not lost on me. That was the low point. The high point was the actual food stands they set up at night. It is beyond! Endless nuts, figs, dates, fresh juices, and not super cheap, but still really fun to experience. My hubby LOVES figs and dates, so we bought what felt like 100 bucks worth and he was in heaven. The scene at night is far different from the day. Lots of crowds and it all feels a bit more congested due to the food stands and trucks that take up a lot of real estate. We didn\u2019t try any of the actual street food, but I\u2019m sure it would have tasted just as good coming back up as it did going down (I keed, I keed). It\u2019s a chaotic hot mess. There are those people selling the little light up toys that they shoot in the air similar to the Eiffel tower scene. Whatever. Oh, another high point (for my husband) and a low point (for me) was that everywhere we went, some proprietor of Moroccan goods would try to lure us in by telling by hubby that he looks like, \u201cBruce Willis\u201d (he does) and that I look like \u201cLady Gah-GAH\u201d (I don\u2019t). Why does my hubs get to look like a total hottie and I look like, well, a nottie?! I\u2019d have rather them tell me I look like Beyonce or at least Cher. Overall, this place was unforgettable."

In the evenings you literally immerse yourself in a sea of people of all colours and styles watching snake charmers and monkey handlers together with hordes of locals and tourists thronging through the various food stalls where you can drink freshly squeezed orange juice or eat a sheeps head. The quality of the foods available was excellent and very cheap, as four of us ate for a total of 220 Dirham (15stg)"

If you like being harassed by taxi drivers, horse drawn carriage drivers, market stall holders, unofficial guides, sellers of nicked i-phones, Argan oil, water boys, anyone you turn a camera on, restaurant touts, acrobats and the dubiously disabled, not to mention the owners of each and every outlet in the souks that you look at, then this is the holiday for you.If you like being ripped off by the temporary restaurants in the square in the evenings with their clever trick of taking your order then bringing you a few olives, some bread and some salad, which any proper restaurant provides as a freeby, and charging you exorbitantly for these on top of your order, then this is the holiday for you.If you like bland food, despite the mounds of spices being sold right next to where you are dining and, if you are female, like having your arm grabbed by a wandering henna artist who will have a design on the back of your hand before you can react and then want paying for her 'art' then this is the holiday for you.If you simply want to stroll unhindered, photograph the goings on, the street artists. the acrobats, the musicians, without hassle then this definitely not the holiday for you.The smell of sewage that emanates from the each and every manhole cover is not at all pleasant and on entering the souks early enough you will see the stall holders trying to block up any holes in the covers with whatever comes to hand.We spent the most of the holiday saying 'No' to every other person and were left with the impression that it was once a great place that is now overbuilt and drastically in need of a shake up. Pavements are a disgrace and are broken and in need of repair even in the new town, Guerliz, The saving grace is the collection of parks that are a delight to wander round and which are well tended and offer a quiet respite just yards away from the hustle and bustle of the streets.All that said we met a man who said he was on his 14th visit and who was recently engaged to a local girl. It takes all types. We've been, we've seen, we've experienced Marrakech but we won't return."

It's the busiest and most interesting site. You get to experience old school morocco. The plaza is this huge open space surrounded by small shops selling lamps, crafts, dinnerware, leather items, amongst many others. At the back you will arrive at the food section and you have endless possibilities! I know we want to be super adventurous and get the best foodie experience but I would recommend staying away from the food carts for food, instead go to the cleaner, bigger, a bit more expensive stands surrounding the area. And this was advice from the locals here, they said carts are not hygienic at all so it's a hit or miss. Do try all of the juice carts, amazing citrus juice! In the center of the medina is where all the entertainment happens; comedian, snake charmers, monkeys, singing, music, etc. You will probably be staying close to this area so just head out there and explore. I do advise hitting a drop pin on your phone map when you are in the hotel so you can at least see your location on a map. Behind the medina, where most of the hotels/hostels are, is another shopping section full of little alleys and you will get lost, be prepared! But as long as you have a clear understanding of where you are on the map you will be fine. Don't think you can ask around, not a lot of people know about the hostels or hotels around the area, and if you are staying at an expensive hostel you probably don't want people knowing you are heading out there. Just saying!"

It is actually amusing how great this always works... even a lot of people might not be happy with it. But just keeping your distance and not giving them your hand ( to grab you ) will keep you out of trouble.Later in the afternoon the food stalls open and offer their selling practices and nice food too. With loads of story tellers, sellers and guys setting up funny games under the sky.The best way in my opinion to enjoy this whole place is to laugh about and to dive into the atmosphere. It is just a great funny game which you hardly see anywhere else.I loved it so much that I even recorded all the noise that was around me.What a different but fascinating little universe."

I kept saying \"I don't want this\", but she persisted. it's a pity as I'd love to have taken my time and had it done properly, but in the time that we were together we had a nice chat, and of course I gave her some money. she did seem genuinely desperate to earn something for that day.

At times i can be very timid and heard so many horror stories! on my return i cannot stress enough to ignore the bad things you read, and to visit with an open mind. take a walk, get lost in the souks and enjoy. people will haggle you in various ways, just be confident with a firm no thank you. you will make mistakes (i was forced in to a henna tattoo as i was too polite to pull my hand away - she wanted 600 dirhams (we paid 150 - it should be 80!!!) but just laugh it off. it is experience, harmless and funny. say a third of the price they offer and start to walk away if they say no..they always come running!! agree a price BEFORE taking any photos of the snakes or monkeys - they will ask for more after the monkey is on your head if you don't. just be brave! at times it can be intimidating (then i just hid behind my boyfriend) - but smile & have a joke - 98% of the morrocans i spoke to were friendly and smiled back!"

Must have looked like new arrivals because we got jumped by what seemed like everyone we passed. We stopped at the outer edge to look about,at which point a henna \"artist\" grabbed my wifes hand and started drawing on it with a syringe of what looked like poo. Despite saying no and my wife trying to pull her hand away the woman carried on. Upon finishing she demanded 500dh for her child we ended up giving her 200dh and going home early wondering why we came to marrakech. Day 2,older and wiser we returned and had more of the same but used the maybe later or no thanks technique which seemed to work. Had lunch on one of the terraces which worked out about \u00a36 each including tip and was pretty good. Wandered the souks and found that trying to avoid eye contact and again saying no thanks worked. Managed a bit of bartering and found that after a visit to arinsal craft market that we had figures in our head of prices so went 10-20dh lower as our topline and the telling them you will look elsewhere tended to work. Lot of stalls are set up with mostly tourist tat and knockoffs but worth a look anyway. The cake and cinnamon drink stalls were great and only about 10dh a sitting. Orange juice was great value at about 20p a glass. Food stalls we tried were very cheap and all were pretty good where you could order a selection from menu and we never paid over about 100dh for 3 courses including drinks each. In the evening all the food stalls pressure you to dine with them and it is actually quite an amusing experience,they will watch you come out of one after eating but still pounce on you to eat with them. There is an ice cream shop with a terrace right at the entrance which gives a great view out across the entire square and you can sit and people watch for a while. The sad part is the condition monkeys are kept in, made to wear nappies and chains which they pull at only to be disciplined by their \"masters\" then thrown on the next passer-by. In conclusion this has to be seen but i almost feel if i hadnt then i would have gotten over it."

In the night, it turns into somewhat of a crazy eatery with lots of food stalls who can get a bit aggressive to get you to sit down and eat. Be warned. In the square you will find huddles of street performers or \"buskers\" singing songs for a price. Be careful though, taking pictures, or even giving attention will end up costing you. This often comes in the form of the entertainers demanding some form of payment. 10 Dirham coin is often enough, don't let them intimidate you. An amazing fusion of European, African and Arab."

Yes, it's the famous square with its snake-charmers, tooth-pullers, musicians, orange juice sellers and the night market, so you have no choice. Your friends would never speak to you again if you did not go at least once.Your reaction to the square will depend on your experiences elsewhere. If you have been living a sheltered life with your idea of hassle the check-outs at Sainsbury's on a Saturday, you will be bowled over and dazzled, but more experienced travellers are likely to be a little underwhelmed by the experience.The problem with the square is that it is a victim of its own celebrity. Most activity there is designed purely for the benefit of its visitors (tourists and locals), so that snake-charmes, musicians, tooth-pullers and water-carriers are there to extract money for photos, and nothing more.The night market was a little more lively with masses of tented restaurants put up to serve freshly-made food, if you like that sort of thing.So go there, take a few photos if you can, raid the souks if you have the energy, then get on with what Marrakech really has to offer."

I can't imagine any local shopping here.The food stalls were also a disappointment, apparentally stall 1 and 14 are recommended. Food was cheap- a lot of deep fried stuff, next time i'll probably try eating where i can spot the locals.The square is pretty much alcohol free- though apparently you can get some alcohol served in coke cans if you know where. there are a lot of street performers, i particularly disliked the monkeys on chains, which were all made to wear nappies. A particular trick is just for their owners to plonk the monkeys on the shoulders of unsuspecting tourists and then ask for money to take a photo. There are so called snake charmers with their defanged cobras also asking for money for pictures.Women will also hassle you to get henna done.I just felt hassled constantly from all sides."

The square during the day for me is a bit of a nightmare as I'm snake phobic and its full of snake charmers, but I love Marrakech so it's take deep breath and stick to the edges of the square and you are fairly safe, a lot of the day time stuff can and does contain cruelty to some birds I saw a kestrel on a piece of string with its tail feathers cut off performing tricks. Generally the animals are not too bad, cats appear to do quite well and the horses and most donkeys/mules looked ok the odd one made me a bit sad, but they provide food for them. The souks are a must, and are a lot of fun, yes you can get hassled but generally they will stop when you say no thanks and continue your shopping, I have never felt the slightest bit threatened as a woman, I fact I would say the people are very respectful and helpful. It's a place to enjoy the experience sit and drink mint tea and have fun. At night it completely changes all the day time people disappear and as if by majic the food stalls are there and almost the whole square is transformed into a big food area, I love it!! A lot of the food I would not choose to eat but I respect the fact that this is what the locals and visiting Moroccans eat and at least they eat every part of the animals they kill. But that to one side it's a really good oportunity to try lots of different food, you can see the food and I must say I found a good level of hygiene and have eaten on a number of occasions and not been ill in the slightest. Just watch the water as local water is not for drinking. "

Be selective about which stall to eat at, and have a good look around before deciding.Food is so so, and you need to be careful when it comes to paying as the bill may be higher than you expect. The stallholders can add a few things if you do not check carefully notwithstanding that a) they have to make a living and b) to most westerners the experience is still relatively cheap."

A place to go for experience,i love the orange juice stalls, they are fresh and cheap at only 5dh per plactic cup..there is a lot to see especially at night from the food stalls to the monkeys and snake charmers. But what i really dislike are the pedlars that forces you to eat or buy what they are selling even the ladies who does henna tattoo, they keep on pestering you to the point of harassment. Hence you have to be firm to say no and a polite no is no good. One of the pedlars in the food stalls even tried to hold my arms just so we would go and eat at their stalls..the food in the stalls are also serve by hand. I think it is acceptable for them to touch the food they are selling. By and large, still its a must see!"

Cobras, monkey on-a-chain (treated very badly), story tellers, acrobats, belly dancers etc. are part of the bustle on the square. Watching is free, photos result in demands for money-don\u2019t pay more than 10MAD. Always be firm, don\u2019t be afraid to say no.It is an amazing square with entrances to the souks and surrounded by cafes - go for one with upstairs terrace where you can sit and observe, and take photos without being hassled. I recommend the one on the right side when you walk from Koutubia into square (tea/coffee 20MAD).The orange juice, freshly squeezed orange juice for 4 MAD a glass or in a plastic cap 5MAD, grapefruit 10-15MAD for a glass. I recommend juice stall 24 (very good quality juices) \u2013 opposite of number 25.After 5pm the square fills up with food stalls. Avoid food stall 25 \u2013 the food was crap and they asked for 280MAD for 2 person! 4 German guys sitting next to us, paid 100 Euros-unbelievable! I just refused and paid only 150MAD. Again, be firm when they try to con you and before you order, ALWAYS ask for a price! And by the way, maybe it is worth to eat there once just to see it, but we preferred to eat far from the square where other locals eat so you still have real Moroccan food and often pay less."

At about 430 pm until late at night this plaza explodes with life. Countless make shift restaurants, stands with all kinds of pure juices, stands with all sorts of nuts and people selling everything. You can also find people telling stories, people betting in really fun games, singers, performers, you name it. All the shops in and around as well as restaurants are also open.

One couple in particular had more and more arriving all the time. The first couple naturally questioned their bill. Only to be told it was correct as each plate was counted. Far more than they had expected. The next couple had a bill of 40\u20ac for a lot of food they hadn't ordered or even eaten. It was just sat on the table untouched. They payed but clearly not happy. When it came to us. I had already totalled our bill and because we sent away all that we hadn't ordered they decided to increase the bill anyway. When I told them they were wrong that they should bring me the menu and I would show them. They tried to bring me a different menu in a different language. I refused until they showed me the large menu in English which one of them had just moved. At thus stage they told me to pay what I wanted! Beware...nothing is free , despite what might be implied."

Fabulous views. The market is a hub of activity and haggling is expected. The stalls in the centre tend to be cheaper but we found an amazing stall en route to the Berbere market which had kaftans for 50 dirhams - stunning ones. 50 dirhams is less than \u00a34,00! The noise, lights, music etc were all thrilling. At no point did we feel unsafe and there was no sign of the pickpockets we were warned about. taxis are plentiful for the return journey to the hotels, but you need to negotiate a good price - we paid 40 dirhams for the return journey of around 2-3 miles and felt that was fair as taxi drivers have to pay to get a spot there"

They are freshly cooked in front of you and locals eat there too. Usually after 6pm the square comes alive. - Have a freshly squeezed orange juice for 4 dirhams. It's very refreshing as the square is noisy and chaotic. - During the day have mint tea or a soft drink whist sitting on an upstairs terrace and take in the gorgeous view. Don't:- Buy things you are not interested in. I was approached on numerous occasions to go into shops and then look at things which I had no interest in. A polite, firm no is sufficient. (Everyone is friendly but they can also be pushy into making a sale). - Exchange money at the hotel. There is a small bank situated by the entrance of the square which I found offer better rates. - Take photos of the snake charmers, unless you are prepared to pay for the privilege! - Be confined to stay within the square, venture into the lanes and explore the souks."

Once you dive into it and the souks (which are really one thing...) the overwhelming diversity of flavours and noise might just take your breath. Most of the places and People around are likely to Start shouting, singing, dancing,... to get your attention. This place is one of the touristic hotspots of the city. In case that you will want to eat sth. this is also a good place since the whole square faces regular controls (food security). A great Start is one of the many stands which sell fresh orange juice for 4 Dh (approx. 0,4\u20ac) and then take a long walk just following your own nose. Be aware that you will permanently be asked to pay either for taking a picture (beware of monkeys and snakes) or be drawn into one of the many shops (or people sitting on the floor). If you look alot like a Tourist (and you are most likely to do so) know ahead that every favour you will receive will be followed by a request for money. I still recommend you to get sb to show around, since especcially in the souks it's hard to find the way to certain places on your own. For example once a week the Berber people are coming to the city to craft the leather which is interesting to see. And there is Way more in the souks starting from here.But most Important: take your time to see and experience this place. And try the juice!"

Monkeys on chains , wearing nappies and dresses being dragged about to be placed on tourists shoulders for a photo!!!! then when they are not needed being placed in a small box until the next tourist comes along.Snake charmers continually making the snake perform and when not obliging giving it a slap. Horses being used to cart people around in carriages from dawn till dusk in the heat and the manic traffic. I understand it is a way of life and a living for these people but if tourists condone the abuse it will carry on.There were lots of people begging on our way to the square and we did witness disabled people being wheeled into an area to beg and hopefully collected later as they were unable to move the wheelchair themselves.Our guild also warned us of pickpockets which a lot of time are children being used by their parents to do this.Unfortunately the whole trip was mard by the lack of respect for animals and we wouldn't return not just to the square but also morrocco."

It is out of this world and worth 2 visits at least: one in the day and another at night. The actual Jemaa is a large square where a lot of the old merchants would have their stalls but now in the day time it is host to snake charmers, ladies trying to give you henna tattoos, kids trying to sell you packs of tissue and small bands playing traditional music. The snake charmers were amazing but be warned: if you choose to take a picture (and you look like a foreigner) they will come up to you and will not stop hasseling you until you give them money and not \"coin\" money but \"bill\" money. We went to the Jemaa on our first day in Marrakech so my bf and I lost a bit of money: 400Dh to be exact!!! We made the mistake of feeling some sort of obligation to give them what they asked for (which quickly dissipates the longer you are in Marrakech). So my advise is One: stop taking pictures so obviously, 2. never take out your wallet (always have some small bills and change in your front pocket and say \"this is all I have, take it or leave it. They will always take it if you are firm that that is all you have. 3. sometimes watching is enough. This is a don't miss kind of place in the medina."

Various snakes are put out, wrapped around tourist necks, dragged into crowds to be \"charmed.\" Then small hungry rodents are let out of their cages and need to run a gauntlet of snakes in order to reach their food. All this in the name of entertainment. Then there are the carriage horses. These poor creatures stand on stone surfaces all day wearing steel shoes rather than rubber to absorb some of the impact. In February many were overheated; I can only imagine how awful it must be for them in summer. Turtles for sale are crammed together in filthy cages.

Fake merchandise isn't that obviously displayed and of average quality. Dont bother with a 'guide', the area is actually quite small and you wont be lost for long. Eat the food at your own risk!!"

Very noisy and busy but that's Marrakech! Eat at the stall's, pick the ones with the most locals and that seemed work for us! 14 & 31 are the best and cheapest! wait for a seat rather than getting convinced to move on to another where all the tourists are!

It was also a good focal point to head back for (or be directed back to) whenever we got lost. During the day it was fun to have freshly made orange juice and look at various items for sale. There were also several cafes just on the side of the square to have some nice food in before heading into the souqs. It was also a different experience to be in the square when the call to prayer happened from the nearby mosques. At night, we went to visit the various food stalls (there were over 100) for dinner on a few of the evenings. Most of the stalls seemed to be selling the same and we didn't find the food to be as tasty as in surrounding cafes although it was a really great experience to sit in the busy square and eat. Even though the sellers advertise that it is \"all the same food, just different faces selling it\" we did notice a difference between stalls and learnt to go for the busiest stalls.What puts me off giving the square a higher rating was the number of monkey trainers and snake charmers that we came across. We did not go near these but saw how the monkeys were chained and pulled around for photos with tourists and it made me and my friends really sad to see. "

People and stalls are everywhere, there is much to see.The best way to get a feel for the square is to be in it, but if you don't like the hustle and the hassling then lots of french style cafes surround the square and they give an excellent view of the square whilst serving both drinks and food.The food stalls in the evening are great (despite many of them selling the same thing), but it is cheap and tasty.However if you push your way to the front of one of the many mini-crowds which form around the entertainment you will find that most of it is much the same, and in truth has little entertainment value. Furthermore if you don't speak French or Arabic then many have no value to an English speaker. Finally the snake charmers do have a tendency to hassle you, and put snakes around your neck without being asked. I am ok with this - my girlfriend is not! They will also ask you to delete any pictures you take of the snakes unless you pay them. They have no right to do this but they get quite aggressive if you do not.Overall it is definitely worth a visit and it is the main meeting point and entry point of the many souks (markets) which expand from it like spider webs. I very much recommend it for dinner as a cheap, tasty and cultural way of seeing Marrakech at night."

As the darkness descends the activities multiply: snake charmers, performers, story tellers draw large circular crowds of enthusiastic on-lookers. Street sellers throw lighted parachutes into the sky to intrigue the youngsters. There are scores of temporary eating venues, hugely populated with customers wrapped in coats as the temperature begins to cool. The locals are focused on their pleasure.One was warned about pick-pockets and one could have a sense of fear, but it was also magical, strange and intriguing. The outsiders frequently watch activities from tea-rooms over looking the square, but to feel the manic, warm charm one needs to be amongst it.An experience never to be forgotten."

During the day there are the snake charmers and locals with monkeys who want you to take pictures and then pressure you for money, this can be quite intimidating. Also stay away from the ladies who want to draw motives on your hands, if you are not careful, they start to draw without your permission. In the evening it is nice to see the locals listening to the story tellers or the many bands. The best thing are the food stalls which are set up in the early evening, you can soon see smoke rising from all the freshly fried food."

By day it's a sprawling area surrounded by shops, cafes and souk entrances containing a milling crowd of people attracted to (or repulsed by) assorted animal trainers (monkeys and snakes), street vendors selling all manner of (mainly) rubbish, many stalls selling fruit and fresh orange juice, all priced identically. But it bustles and it's a good place for people watching although don't stare or, even worse, take photos of them without permission, Islam is not keen on images, photographic or otherwise. In the evening it comes to life with dozens of food stalls with their grills and barbecues all vying for your attention and custom. For most Europeans this is an exotic location and one would normally be a little wary of street food but all the stalls have to have a license to operate, which includes meeting good hygiene standards, and they are inspected regularly to ensure those standards are maintained. Nothing is guaranteed but they are probably as safe as most European cities, if not more so, I certainly had no ill effects. Best time to see it is as the sun sets, casting a glow over the steam and smoke emitted from the food stalls. Definitely better in the evening than in the day.If you are \"caught short\" be aware that the public conveniences (bathrooms!) are Arab-style with a glazed hole in the floor with foot rests on which you squat. Clean up is by taking a can of water with you into the stall to wash the relevant areas. Not recommended for the novice, to avoid this go into one of the larger cafes which have western-style pedestals, although you will need to purchase sheets of toilet paper."

Snake charmers, food stalls, horse drawn buggies, donkeys pulling food carts, women doing henna tattoos, people doing other shows I've no idea what they were actually doing, the few sordid folk selling hashish, etc, etc.But this is a different culture! Look closely and see what's going on. Hear the noises. Smell the food and spices...During the day or night, there's something going on. Here's a few things I learned.Snake-charmers: Don't take a picture unless you want to pay. We were 15 meters away and my girlfriend wanted a photo, so I took one. Mistake! Their ears are attuned to the shutter click, even amid the chaos that is the noise. One immediately turned around (their backs were turned to us) ran over to us and more or less pulled us to the snakes, wrapping one around me (which is fine - I like snakes). They will start playing that tune that everyone knows on the flute when you think of snake charmers. We took lots of pictures. 1 minute later, they said 200 dirhams. That's $20 US DOLLARS! Laugh. I said no way, while at the same time another said 300 dirhams!! Laugh again! That's $30 dollars. I said you know what, here's 100 dirhams ($10 dollars) and walked away. Really I should have just thrown 'em some coins...Juice stands: It's 4 dirham for a fresh juice drink. That's roughly 40 cents! They squeeze the juice for you right then and there and it is delicious. Use the straws provided - I've read they don't wash but only rinse the glasses they give you, even after other customers have used them.ATMs: There are several at the square and down one of the larger pedestrian roads adjacent to it.Food stalls: So at night a hundred or so food stalls materialize where earlier in the day there were none. They are cheap and very good. Maybe $10 for two people. But, what I found is to eat where the locals do, and you'll pay LESS than $2 for two people. There were two particular stalls, one serving just soup and dates (oh sooo good) and the other stall serving sandwiches, filled with nothing but butter, cheese, potatoes, egg, and a type of red spicy sauce. I recommend trying these. At both stalls we were the only tourists, but I didn't care - the food was great and so super cheap.Shops: Yes, they want you to buy their wares. Even looking for more than one second in a shop or at an item displayed out front, or even just lingering in front of a shop for a few seconds, they will beckon you to come in. It is annoying, no doubt. But, you'll become deaf to it in no time. Remember, it's their culture to trade and barter. They also make a very meager means of living, especially relative to tourists. As such, they go to great lengths to sell you things. Just smile and say no thanks and move on. Their feelings won't be hurt.Look, it is hectic and kinda crazy, but you've gotta just go with the flow. Try the food, wander around, and smile. Life is short.Recommendation: Pay a little more for a meal in one of the many restaurants and sit on the rooftop terrace to get a good view of the square and the happenings in it!"

Also it's very easy to get lost and we had to pay 5 Euros to a lad to guide us out of the maze in the Souk back to the square.

Even to the souks everyone is trying to sell something from fake garments to toys to worn battered items of clothing like old tops and shoes. It's sad to see the poor people trying to earn and living elderly people selling stuff which have no value and won't sell if it was the last thing on earth. You get elderly and children selling tissues and biscuit. The sad part is when you're eating people approach you and ask you for your food.The souks can be a bit of a maze and you can easily get lost. Don't listen to the people guiding you which way to go. To be honest if it wasn't for my other half I would have been lost. I saw videos on the markets and I really wanted to try a dish called meshui it's a little side alley just of the square it is a whole lamb slow roasted in a clay put in the ground. I highly recommend it, they will cut you off some of the meat and serve it with bread sprinkle a little cumin and salt on it. Avoid the snake charmers and men with monkeys. They treat the animals really bad. You can see the pain in the faces of the little monkeys holding on to the chains. We also visited the new town didn't think much of that. Make sure to try the little restaurants in square they serve really good food. I didn't. Eat at the stalls was a little out of from the hygiene. We went to a place called la salama just on the road next to cafe France for drinks and Shisha.It is very expensive compared to he rest of Marrakech for food but it's prices what you would pay in England."

They literally take your arm and try to pull you in. We felt a bit ripped off when we had dinner at a food place: they told us eat here and get free tea. They gave us a lot of different food without asking and of course we had to return that as it is a way to charge more money. Anyway, we ordered some food and the tea. When we got the bill we had to pay 10 dirhams (1 euro) each for the cup of tea with the explanation that we got the big cup and that one isn't free. After being a bit angry we got a new small cup for free but had to pay for the bigger one. This is one of the many ways they try to make money of you. I'd rather recommend to go to the mountains, it's beautiful and the people are way more honest."

It was fasinating to see it all.But even with all the crowds and activity, the friendliness and good humour of the locals was wonderful. More than once we were wished a \"good day\" by a complete stranger; people went out of their way to direct us if we were lost; and the man standing outside a restaurant to attract custom charmingly directed us to a bar when we said we only wanted a drink (Marrakech is not an easy place to find a beer!).You haven't seen Marrakech if you haven't been to Jemaa el Fna!"

Just brilliant!Don't be intimidated, though, just smile and don't get into a conversation. No thanks or Non Merci will get you off the hook usually but the magic bullet is the Arabic \"La Shokran\". It just means no thanks and the hustlers just disappear! Travel rep told us... And it works!One other piece of advice... If you wander into the Souks and get lost DO NOT get into conversation with anyone who offers to show you the way out. We heard so many stories of unexpected visits to tanneries and demands for expensive fees that we were almost put off the place before our first visit!If lost, either ask a stallholder or just keep wandering till you find your way out. Actually, we found the Marrakech Souks far less intimidating than many others we've been to!Have a great time in Marrakech but don't miss Marrakech food tours - the highlight of our week!"

This square is very much the gateway into the old town, hence many tourists gravitate towards the area which brings in the locals looking to capitalise on the opportunity. In the day I found this area to be quite barren - there were large gaps between the stalls and entertainers with even the snake charmers looking uninterested although it was a particularly hot day!. That said, there is some entertainment (and sanctuary from street performers) in people watching from the cafes on the periphery. At night, the square becomes an open air restaurant which i found to be the most atmospheric and interesting time of the day. Just remember to smile and take any approaches from the street performers and henna ladies in good humour."

We found them to give decent food at a cheap price although it's even cheaper elsewhere. The street theatre is fairly lame, they wouldn't earn a coin on a European street. Drumming bands add to the atmosphere. Bad points: the animal cruelty is highly uncomfortable, please stay away from the chained monkeys and abused snakes. Also the Henna ladies are dreadful, one yanked my wife's hand unbidden and started drawing on her, she then demanded money despite basically committing assault. "

The fruit and nut stands don't like to sell small quantities, be firm if you only want a quarter or eighth of a kilo.We were waiting in line at one of the ATMs located on the edge of the square when Fatima engaged my wife in conversation. Next thing you know she had seized my wife`s hand and was drawing a henna design on it against our protests. Finished, she demanded 400 dirhams! To her outrage we gave her 20 dirhams. \"Take twenty or nothing\" we countered, as we did not ask for this. Then we turned and walked away.Yes, there are snake handlers, but if you look terrified they leave you alone. Likewise the guys who have monkeys on leashes. You can get your picture taken with either of the above, but expect to pay for the photo op. Negotiate the fee first, before you agree to anything.The square can be entertaining or overwhelming. If someone is pestering you, be firm in your refusal and then ignore him. If you waver, you're a goner."

Here you will see apes, snakes, card players, birds, chicken etc. You can have a coffee or dinner in a restaurant and of course you can find souvenirs. Or you go shopping in the souks. Do not forget to buy spices. But search for a shop were no tourists go inside! When almost only locals will buy there then you will find the best price.

The highlight of any trip to Marrakesh is wandering through the tiny walkways in the souks and eventually finding yourself in the Jemaa el Fna, the main square always bustling with people with tons of things to see. Getting to Jemaa el Fna can be difficult as none of the streets have names, maps are difficult to read/are incorrect, and some Moroccans take it upon themselves to try to direct you only to ask for money in exchange. The square itself is filled with food stalls, snake charmers, people with monkeys, and women selling jewelery and offering henna tattoos. I would avoid the food stalls AT ALL COSTS. It is not worth saving like 50 cents only to get seriously ill when the place selling you orange juice reuses the same straw over and over again. The restaurants surrounding the square are considered overpriced by Moroccan standards but are steal an incredible steal by American standards. Several have great outdoor seating options with seats on rooftops and balconies, and this is an experience in itself to just sit back and watch everyone around you and the daily life in Marrakesh. Women take note, some of the men here are INCREDIBLY aggressive and will stop at nothing to touch you. I've had random men try to kiss me, grab my butt, hold my hand, take me inside their shops, etc. Most of the Moroccan men are incredibly nice and friendly and just want you have to a good time in their country, but the few that harass you and yell at you while you walk and ask how many camels they can buy you for, ruin it for the rest. I hate to say this but this is definitely a place where traveling with a man is recommended."

However again the kestrel looked in very good shape and appeared not to be stressed and happy to perch on my head and wrist. The usual stalls with more or less the same sort of stuff. Night time was a blast. Dark but the entertainers had their own lights - storytellers and fortune tellers - men dressed as dancers with their own musicians. Large circles of people around the more interesting spectacles. I was dragged into a large circle to try the 'belly dance' with the he dancer. What a laugh and I got applause from the mainly Moroccan audience. Heaps of food stalls with sitting area - the food looked delicious and the eaters all looked to be enjoying it. A must see."

You cannot visit the souk for example, unless you cross the square from one side to another, where you will be passing all of chaos that takes place within this square. The origin of its name is unclear: Jemaa means \"congregational mosque\" in Arabic, probably referring to a destroyed Almoravid mosque. \"Fan\u00e2\u02bc\" or \"fin\u00e2'\" can mean \"death\" or \"a courtyard, space in front of a building.\" Thus, one meaning could be \"The mosque or assembly of death,\" or \"The Mosque at the End of the World\". Another explanation is that it refers to a mosque with a distinctive courtyard or square in front of it.A third translation is \"assembly of the dead\", referring to public executions on the plaza around 1050 AD. Anyway, regardless of the explanation of the name, what makes it so special is the activities that takes places within this square, that includes many traditional activities including youths with chained Barbary apes, water sellers with traditional leather water-bags and brass cups, and snake charmers. During the day it is predominantly occupied by orange juice stalls, which is one of the very best things juices we had. Well worth the visit.

If it's your first time in marrakech or a situation similar this could be quite a culture shock, but you'll get used to it.Things to be aware of: a little bit of child exploitation with child boxing fights, you'll see these by a circle of men congregating and different areas in the square, personally my friends are not into this and didn't pay attention but if this is your kind of thing then please be aware you're likely to be pick-pocketed standing so close to people.Animal abuse: monkeys on chain, monkeys in clothes, monkeys being punched and kicked and twirled round on a metal chain, baby monkeys watching this happen to their mothers. If you make any form of eye contact with the owners for a period of time they will approach you with them. Again, if you're into this please be aware you'll have to pay for the privilege of a chained wild animal to sit on your head etcetc.Horse carriages: plenty of carriages and touts trying to get you to ride in them, no water for said horses and over-grown hooves been made to canter/gallop on cement roads. Not particularly pleasant for the animalsSnake charmers: dancing snakes-they might try to put them on you-you may want to take a photo-you'll have to pay/they'll try to swindle you.Child beggars: selling tissues etc, adorable sad tiny children following you for a good 10mins, we usually have them food instead of money.Henna: henna artists may approach you and put the ink on your hand, this never happened to us, we were very quick to say \"no merci, maybe later/next time inshallah\" this worked very well for us (in all situations), however we watched other tourists being pestered and bombarded for money and having their hands forcefully henna'd. A tip here is to be strong and polite! This go's for pretty much all of marrakech, don't feel bad just assert yourself and you'll be okayOkay the good things: food, banter with locals, great trinkets and gifts to buy, it's a crazy experience that you need to go into with an open mind, it helps to laugh and accept it for what it is."

Expect to pay the entertainers even a small fee if you want pictures of their monkeys or snakes. Personally I did not get a picture with the monkeys for ethical reasons as they are kept on chains. Women should be wary of the henna ladies, they can be pushy and will try to take your hand. I found that just keeping my hands out of their way helped. The orange juice is a must do as well - make sure it's the fresh one not watered down. There is one guy in particular who is nice and honest, I think it's cart no.43 from memory. (His cart is in the middle of three or four and facing one of the entrances to the medina). One of the things I found most interesting was the switch between day and night. In the late afternoon the men who run the food stalls come and set up entire mini restaurants in such a short time. Whatever time you come here there will be something to see. If you are really worried about being harassed or ripped off then get a guide (costing approx 80dh) to show you around and tell them you're not interested in buying anything. This will keep the sellers off your back."

I've experienced hassle before but not on this scale, the men enticing you to eat at their stall can be quite aggressive, annoying and some pretty funny. Hungry, we were trying to choose a stall but couldn't choose ourselves so we just chose one that didn't hassle us. The food was highly disappointing, cold, under cooked and pretty boring. looking around later on with food in our bellies and a clear mind we discovered that except for a few stalls selling soups and sheep heads, it's all the same food. The presentation of the food at the stall, the menus and no doubt the origin of the foods are exactly the same.Aside from the food, the orange juice is absolutely gorgeous so that was a great plus.There are other entertainers at the square which are great. The snake charmers, musicians and dancers fun. Beware of the men holding monkeys as they will throw them on you and demand payment, which is fine if you're happy to pay for a picture. There are ladies with henna which most, are pleasant when offering their services. However there were a couple who would grab your hand and even one who dug her nails so hard in my girlfriends hand it left a mark, so do beware of this."

Jemaa El Fna is definitely one of the main attractions in Marrakech, and I stayed in a Riad (Moroccan house) on one of the side streets leading off it.The market square has all sorts of goods on sale: food, spices, ornaments, furniture, jewellery - you name it! Also there are various people with animals that you can take photos with, for a fee of course. My main word of caution is to not let the locals overcharge you. While it is probably acceptable to pay \u00a31 or \u00a32 for a photo they will try to charge you \u00a315, so that you end up settling on something much higher than \u00a31 or \u00a32. Just hold your ground whenever bartering, and set the price before you do anything like take a photo or have henna painted. Don't flash your cash either, and be firm in your decisions and you should get good deals out of your visit. The market (in the building part) also has various fruit, nut and spice stands, and these generally have prices so you won't get cheated. They also let you taste their goods, which is useful!I definitely recommend visiting this market, you will enjoy it for sure :)"

You can also use the horse and carriage as a taxi if you can both come to a price you are happy with. The fresh squeezed orange juice stalls are not only great value the juice is gorgeous! The dried fruit and nuts are also goegeous and whats great with both of these is that they all have the same price. There is a wealth of grill stalls to choose from all pretty much offering the same thing for the same price. In the evening the sqaure fills with the smell of charcoal smoke and bbq meat. There are 3 soup stalls which sell a gorgeous soup. It is 3D for a bowl of soup and also 3D for the dates or 'sweet' which you eat alongside it. 9D for all 3 is a steal and really good hearty food. You will see a lot of locals eating this soup. This is a good way to enter the Souks, you may not get out that way as it is very easy to get lost in the market alleys. Choose a cafe with a terrace for a different view of the Jamaa el-Fna. It's interested wathcing the sun go down and the market change. Some will try to charge more for the benifit of the terrace rather than downstairs. Towards the evening to other foodstalls start arriveing and the sqaure fills with more performers. Locals also gather to hear stories and you will see circles of people watching others performing their tales.If anyone puts a snake or a monkey on you or puts their hat on your head and dances with you and you take a photo they will want paying. If you so much as look at a man with a snake he may try to make a beline for you to put it around you neck. Just walk on from these people or if they are close enough to try and get an animal on you then a firm but polite no does the trick.If you take a photo of someones snake, monkey or them with thier snake or monkey... they will want money. Do it from a distance. If you do decide you are happy to pay for the novelty they will try to rip you off. Have some coins ready in your hand \u00a32 pounds or 2 Euros is MORE than enough for a quick photo with a snake but they will try for hundreds. Just give them your change and walk away."

Added to the mix are the snake charmers, musicians, monkey handlers, dancers and story-tellers (wish I could have understood).Be careful when taking photographs as everyone will want money. This is not for the faint-hearted due to the crush of people, overwhelming calls to purchase and, of course, poor treatment of captive snakes and monkeys.This a \"must see\" but it takes a number of visits to take it all in and to enable one can start being selective. Also, you must eat, but be equally selective as to what food you think your stomach will handle (\"no diarrhea\" is one of the calls you will hear as an invitation to eat). Ask your Riad staff to suggest ( we were told to go to Aisha's stall). I will go back one day !"

As I read all the reviews prior to the trip, the outside square was smaller then what I thought. The inside with all the shops and shops and shops are more than what I envisioned. I saw my husband move closer to the men dressed in carnival wear so I thought he had dropped coins in their cup. So my daughter and I were behind him so we couldn't see what he had done so we took a picture with the 3 men. They expected us to pay for the photo, so I said, we had already paid and my husband hadn't paid he was just walking close to them and probably just waved to them and I miss read it. (Anywho, since all the horses are in one section in front of the Club Med, that area has an awful barnyard smell) Siad was a great Caleche driver. We took him back to Sidi Ben Slimane parking lot one night - horse carriage #126. He good information while on the trip and charged us 100MOD flat to go to the newer parts of the city center, near the Novotel Suites and Le Comptoir area and onwards to our Riad. The next day we came to the market (Jemaa el Fna early to have lunch and boy were we surprised........the lunch carts hadn't set up. We didn't know that they are mainly up after 3:00pm - midnight. So we had to go elsewhere for lunch.) We had no idea we couldn't get lunch from the inner carts around 12 noon. I had a lovely Calligraphy work/frame done with our names on it for 50MOD and it includes the frame. I have the 3 names of my family members on it and can't wait to display it. I love helping artists and felt that since the young man only had a table and his art behind him to support him. I didn't get his card but he is near the lane over near the post office that sells all the Chinese imported clothing gadgets. He is very quiet and just looks down at this work. He was quick and he wrapped it nicely in newspaper. Every place we travel in this world we always bring a drum back home to my daughter to add to her collection. The stands/stalls we went to to bargain for the drum was not willing to give it to us at a good rate. Once the merchants hear your accent and know you are on holiday they don't give you great deals. You just bargain the best you can and if you can live with it fine. If you can't just leave. This part of shopping takes up a lot of your time. Just go to places with the prices already written on. We only had 2 days in Casa, 3 in Fes and 3 in Marrakech. WE did not have a lot of time to keep bargaining every station we went to. It eats up a lot of your holiday. Make a list of what you would like to take back before you get to Morocco. Here was my list: Argan oil (for the body), berber rugs/carpets, small souvenirs and Orange blossom oil for the body. I got everything but the drum. Go figure."

The public bathroom in the market is horrible..is a porcelain hole in the floor..so you need to squat and target the hole...ok just horrible. Now, is useful to know how much is everything so you tell them upfront you won't pay nothing else more. Like I did, not even taxi drivers could take one dirham more from me. Like my mother used to say, do you wanna play crazy? So I will be crazy and a half, but if you don't have this kind of personality, avoid Marrakesh, seriously, because you can be very tired to fight the sellers and the rude people. Now having said that, if you focus and don't listen to no one trying to sell anything, if you ask the drivers to turn on the taximeter, and focus in the beauty of the city, you can leave the city with the sweet taste of the best orange juice as the one I had in jemma el fna.

A Berber family dancing and playing music, a game, a lady applying henna tattoos, and a fortune teller. I was a bit disappointed that I missed any snake charmers but the authenticity and vibe of the place made up for it. My family and I skipped the food stalls in the front, where there were men promising us no diarrhoea for the next two years, or others speaking in well rehearsed British accents... I didn't have the heart to tell them that I'm not British. We started off with a harira soup at a very busy stall void of any tourists and packed with locals. The soup was brilliant. Next we ordered mint tea packed with sugar but the perfect pacifier for my sweet tooth. Being pretty adventurous, I decided to try the meat. I kept my head down, trying to seem local and unassuming. But with a giant DSLR hanging from my neck, I didn't quite fit in. In another row of food stalls, only selling meat delicacies like tongue, brain, udder or the more orthodox option beef stew (which I stuck to.) I had some delicious food, the Tunjeya was great and hearty. The square was brilliant and warranted another visit again two nights later."

Find a table in one of the roof terraces which overlook the square, just a couple of floors up, and watch one of the greatest shows on earth unfold before your eyes, as smoke rises from the food stalls and dances on the evening sunlight.Do not randomly point your camera at anyone and everything, as you will be asked to pay for such photos. Politely ask people if you may take a photo and give them a small tip. Do not allow yourself to be bullied or harassed as some of the guys can be pretty full on and heavy. Watch, absorb and enjoy this dizzy delight of daily Moroccan life in Marrakech."

The square is such a beautiful place, steeped in rich history that I find absolutely fascinating. In my opinion it has been absolutely ruined by the people that live there. They seem to hold tourists in complete disdain. It's impossible to sit and have a coffee without people coming up to you literally holding out their hands until you give them money. When you don't, they become abusive, swear and intimidate. My fianc\u00e9 and I had a situation where we're taking a photograph of each other when I man came up claiming that we had taken a photograph of him and his snakes. We were very polite and insisted we were only taking a photo of each other, but he grabbed my arm and shook it causing me to drop my phone on the floor. Luckily my other half is quite a burly sort and grabbed the guy back and he backed off but I was left very shaken and with significant bruising around the top of my arm. Please don't think we are affected western tourists, I have been to many places across the Middle East and have always been respectful and courteous to the locals and their cultures, but Jeema El Fna is the worst place I have visited. We ended up spending most of our trip in the new city, which is nowhere near as historic and fairly soulless, but we felt far safer and relaxed."

Well, if you read the reviews, I find that basically everybody describes the square exactly the same, but only the ratings are different ranging from 5 to 1 stars! :)So fact is: The square is crowded and abysmally smelly (even worse during the day), the snake charmers and monkey handlers are cruel (if you take a picture, they will ask for money and coins won\u2019t do), the musicians are a sorry excuse, the food stalls look dodgy, the henna ladies are pushy (stay polite as long as possible, but get very firm if anybody touches your hand), everything is helplessly overpriced and of cheap quality.Is it worth is? It all depends on your state of mind and probably on the experiences you\u2019ll make. You might have a nice evening with tea on one of the terraces, maybe a snack and heavenly orange juice from the stalls, make a small bargain for a souvenir, and marvel at the peculiarities like the water sellers and dentists. Or you might be shocked by some of the sights and smells, have your cell phone stolen, might be shouted at for 10 Eur for a photo you took while just passing a snake charmer, molested for another 10 Eur by a henna lady who draws a undefined and unwanted swivel on your hand (it is really amazing how quick they can be sometimes\u2026) and for the grand finale might be urged to have an awful overpriced meat skewer that will lock you in the bathroom for the next 24 hours\u2026 Both options are possible and I recommend everyone to go there to see it for yourself. Try to stay at the outskirts at first, stay a little alert and do not let people push you into doing anything."

I just wanted to relax and enjoy the experience but it felt impossible to do. Make sure to get orange juice. Had read how tasty it was, but it really was so yum!!The guide books recommend if you're not interested, then ignore whoever is hassling you. Seems I felt bad doing this, so on a couple of occasions said things like 'maybe another time' etc. But then the hassle was even worse next time I passed their way. They really remember people and was told I hadn't kept my promise, needed to come in to them etc. Very, very intimidating. Yes, perhaps better to ignore if not interested, as the guide books said."

In general as long as you stick to cooked food (no salad) you should be fine. We didn't get sick even though we ate street food all the time. Don't feel pressured to sit at any stall by the continuous pushing of the vendors but sit wherever its busy, use your judgement and follow your nose. The good places are usually less pushy.Besides food you will find snake charmers, different handcrafts and products to buy, boxing matches, traditional dances (by men dressed like women), street performers, monkeys, etc. The night is particularly interesting because of the lights, the smoke, the amount of people walking by and it is completely safe. There are dozens of police officers around and multiple tourists everywhere. The souks (markets) begin at the periphery of this plaza. This place is a MUST!"

We steered clear of the snake charmers and monkeys - not really our thing but we were fascinated by everything else going on. The sounds of drumming and smells of food at night were amazing, everywhere you look there's some sort of entertainment. The transition from day to nighttime is incredible and looking out over the square from one of the cafe terraces is a must do."

Avoid the snake charmers and monkeys as the will try to rip you off, we avoided them but saw plenty of tourists get caught out with a monkey on their shoulder or snake in hand without asking and had to pay to get them removed. Main downside is the amount of kids and other beggars but every city has them so stay strong you won't be able to help all although I highly recommend getting rid of your spare coins to the kids or the ladies selling cookies on the street as they will be the most grateful for anything unlike others who expect only paper money"

If you don\u00b4t like this, here goes a precious tip: just avoid eye contact! When they look at you, just look in another direction and remain quiet...If you going to by something in the markets, you really have to negotiate. And try don\u00b4t look back after to by something, because you going to find the same article cheaper in another place.Beware about what you by. Many products comes from China. Try to by herbs and spice only in the herboristerist (special pharmacy\u00b4s supervised by the government), otherwise you can by a fake product.Don\u00b4t eat there because of the cheap price, but because of the experience. In Guelize (15 minuts from Jemaa El Fna), you can eat the same dishes, with superior quality and paying the same prices (sometimes even cheaper!)."

Of course, but that is par for the course in a marketplace.Just getting lost in the souks is a great experience, permitting us new and interesting experiences. Yep, everyone and their dog wants to help you get back on track with the inevitable little \"Baksheesh\" expected at the end but let's be honest; we are talking a Euro or so and, if you can afford to go there, you can afford the expense of a tip - after all Morocco is strongly dependant on tourism.At night the square really comes to life; with many performers strutting their act in the hope of attracting some change into their hats. You can buy anything and everything there, including getting your teeth pulled \u2013 seriously!The people are amazing and they do respect \"la shukran\" (no thanks) with grace, thanking you with \"Insha'Allah fima borad \" (Allah willing, later).

If you are a non-local looking in appearance, then you have a bullseye written all over your back. It seemed to especially bad in the evenings when we walked past the food vendors. Young men would come toward us, one after another, telling us to come to eat at their booths. We just wanted to see what the different types of foods were available, and instead we were trying to either dodge them, or zigzagging back and forth to have them stop following us. I was even more shocked, when the cussing or insults starting flying from mouths, just because we didn't take a seat in their stall. I was very excited to see all the exotic cuisines that were being offered, but extremely put off by the rudeness of the men. With the aggressiveness of the men, I didn't feel at all comfortable going back down the other aisle to eat knowing the same thing would occur. Having this experience the first night, the next night, we wanted to be more prepared. We stood away from the food stands, and talked out which food we would like to try, so we wouldn't wonder aimlessly through the stands, and even from afar, men would start coming toward us, telling us to come eat! This is was by far, the worst part.....now for the good side. Food was very cheap. We ate 3 nights in a row at various stands, and our bill got cheaper and cheaper each night. For two adults to eat, the bill was 120, 100, and 75 MADs. There will be lots of variety to choose from. Our first night, we had the chicken with couscous and little sausages. Snails in broth, meat skewers, and eggplant for the second night. Lastly, we tried the tagine and sheep head (1/4 head). All were very tasty, and would try again in the future.Some things to keep in mind:#1Be prepared to have thick skin while venturing through the food stands because you will be harassed. If approached, just keep moving on till you are ready to stop and eat.#2Be firm on what is placed in front of you and if you want it or not. We got bread, tomato sauce, olives, and another vegetarian dish without ever uttering one word. #3Make sure the worker writes down the price for you, so everything is calculated correctly. The first night, the place was so busy, they just gave us the total, but all the other places, each item was written down on paper, so we knew what we were paying for.#4Not all menus will have English. Primarily, they will be in French and Arabic. We could guess some of the French items, but mostly we would look at what other people were getting and then point to indicate our order.Overall, it was great to see the Jemaa el Fna at night and try all the new foods, but I could have definitely done without the guys in-your-face aspect of it all."

The Soukhs off the square are amazing. Wonderful spices, leather, jewellery in a labyrinth of tine alleys. I have a legendary sense of direction, but have struggled a couple of times, which can be alarming, so try to remember some landmarks to help you retrace your steps. Please resist offers to take you to the tanneries unless you are with a properly organised group. I fell foul of this several years ago, and after a very interesting visit to the tannery, we were 'handed over' by our 'guide' to a carpet shop owner, who refused to take 'no' for an answer. When we walked out of the shop, we found ourselves alone and a very long way from the Soukh and the main square, in a very rough part of town. Fortunately we stumbled on the best way out, but it could have ended up a very different story.Overall, YES, do go, do enjoy, but please do be aware this is a different way of life here, and be cautious."

For us Jemma el Fna as the Fez medina translate the \"mystique\" of Moroccan traditions (in the big cities anyway, totally different in the desert).Not so crowded during the day, the tourists can enjoy walking trough snake charmers, a few salesman and women doing henna tattoo. (if you are going for that, seek the ones tattooing the locals, and ALWAYS negotiates!). By the sunset the place is crowded with food and orange juice stands, more salesman, more snake charmers and acts of street theater (from boxing to big man dancing in veils). So it's definitely a nice and fun place to end the day. We didn't have any problems of robbery but they are often reported so be careful with you wallet. If seeking for a terrace to observe the square from above (and sneak some traditional photos) try alternatives from the traditional caf\u00e9 that tends to be more expensive and with worst service according to the latest reviews."

The big screen TV was well supported by locals too. By day, it is easier to get accosted as there are fewer people, this time by snake charmers and monkey handlers. We kept well away, having read the reports, and I would also advise the same. However, the musicians, if you like to watch and listen can be fun and they are worth paying, just be careful a monkey handler doesn't put one on your shoulder!"

By day it's interesting if a little seedy-looking, with monkeys dressed up and on chains 'performing' for the tourists alongside snake charmers and a few stalls and attractions. Late afternoon the square clears and there is a noticeable shift its use and atmosphere as the pop-up restaurants appear. I recommend going to one of the hotels or restaurants on the square at this time - order a tea or coffee and watch the transformation by sunset (be careful if you decide to order food as it often costs considerably more to eat on the rooftop terrace of a restaurant than to eat downstairs). Honestly, the street food in the square is of such a high standard that it's hardly worth eating at the restaurants, unless you are looking specifically for fine-dining. You can eat like a king at most stalls for 20-40D - stall 114 is a favourite with the tourists as the staff are so cheerful and the food prices are clearly displayed which is useful - it's also the only place i saw that served squid and prawn tagines which were delicious!"

Do not pay more than 2 Dirhams for a photograph with any of them. There are many Fresh Juice Stalls which serve excellent whole orange juice. They all display the same price but, like everything in Morocco, don't be afraid to barter. Close by there are lots of banks and ATMs. Not all accept all cards. If you can't find one which will accept your card try another. Be very aware of anything unusual at the ATM and watch for people standing close. Having said that it is the same in any Capital City in the World.By night the square is transformed into a vibrant open air market for \"Street Food\". Most stalls sell a variety of traditional Moroccan dishes. Chose one which has a limited menu. They usually do a narrow range of dishes very well. The \"acid test\" is how crowded and how many locals are eating there. The best place to people watch, by day or night, is from the Roof Terrace of many of the surrounding restaurants. Food there is generally of good quality and most restaurants sell wine. You will not find it on the menu as this is a Muslim Country.A \"must visit\" if you are in Marrakesh."

Yes you will be harassed by sellers - just get over it and if you cannot handle that don't come to Morocco. It's part of the local culture, you don't wanna buy - just ignore them. But back to the foodie experience. Food stalls start to open round 5pm so the best time to go for food will be after 6. Otherwise you will be served with reheated leftovers from yesterday. We have tried cooked snails (10 MAD for a medium bowl) You will be given coctail sticks to get the meat out of the shells, and don't forget to drink the stock - that's the best part! The portion's ok to taste but if you want to feel full, you'll need quite a few of those. After reading some reviews on Tripadvisor we've went for some food to Stall 14. It's a seafood place. Absolutely fenomenal! It's always packed but they will squeeze you in, trust me. Be prepare to eat with your hands, on a paper. You won't be given any forks or knives. Forget about the health an safety regulations too (no rubber gloves, no tongs - everything is touched witch hands), but hey - it's a local street food stand not the Ritz! We have ordered a mix plate (battered calamari and 2 kinds of fishes - 30 MAD), and aubergines (lovely, flavoursome, can taste the lemon juice) and grilled peppers (10 MAD each). As usual here you are also given a local big flat roll with your meal.My tip - just break the bread and grab food with it. It was the best meal we have had in Morocco! And the cheapest! A wee PS. There's a lot of nice reviews for a stand 114 but for us it was a greasy dissapoinment with litte portions and \"tajine\" cooked in the pot and just placed in a tajine dish for the looks - a cheat for tourists.

The main square in Marrakesh and, according to the guidebooks, the crazy happening centre of the city full of traders food stalls and entertainers.I visited 10 years ago and all that was true.This time we got a seat on one of the rooftop terraces to watch the sunset with a mint tea (well.... you have to don't you ?) and enjoy the view of the square. As well as the noise of the general hub bub \"Get Lucky\" was blaring out louder than anything else. I think this summed up the issue the Morrocans now have with this place - is it a square which is geared to cater for western tastes - and western pockets (And hey - these guys have to make a living) in which case cool - western disco music - guys who's job it is to have tourists photos taken with them in traditional morrocan gear - a huge tourist coach park and a big screen projector in a corner (which there was) OR is it going to remain a buzzing trading storytelling square which Morrocans can afford to visit.At the moment it's still an amazing place. There is still the local vibe and still the large numbers of locals buying things and relaxing here - the orange vendors and food stalls are all authentic and exciting - but compared to recent visits it's changing. More monkeys held in appaling conditions for tourist photos which is appaling - more western music and more hassle from vendors and photo guys who are there not to trade but to prey on tourists. I half expect a KFC on a corner next visit !So yes its certainly a must see - one can still lose ones self in the general local vibe and it is the focal point of the city - but someone needs to arrest the slide into this turning into a simple tourist trap soon IF they want it to retain its local vibe or it'll be lost."

On my second trip to Marrakech, and Morocco and as a sole travellor i found the guys who try to get you to go to their restaurants too much. All smiles until you decide to carry on past to browse and some can turn pretty nasty, insulting if you dont stop at their place. Some of the places were ok, and served good food for the price, just a shame its so difficult to walk around. Away from the most touristy ones is better and As a group its alot easier to deflect trouble.The other people on the square, snake charmers and drum players, if you ever stand and watch , never mind take a photo, you will get requested to tip tip tip, and whtever you tip it wont be enough. And again they can turn very pushy whether or not you do tip \u00a32 +...Overall its puts you off engaging. Watch out for people giving you any sort of directions too, you will get told the wrong directions to somewhere where one of their friends communicating by mobile will try and take advantage of you. Sometimes its relatively benign, just a big waste of your time, but sometimes yet again if someone along the line doesnt make some money from you , you will get insults. Gets tiring.....Positives: Good atmosphere, smells, sounds and generally good values for money.Away from the square ( Jamaa El Fna ) and Morocco in general can be quite different, but watch out those who seem to be your \"friend\" will often lead you down a path to exploit you."

The daytime one where, in addition to the excellent fresh orange stalls the square is alive with a variety of people. There are certain to be traditional story tellers, although their audience is made up of locals). Almost certainly there will be a colourful water seller. Unlike some locals he is only too keen for you to take a photo of him or him and you wife - for cash! There may be the occasional snake charmer, juggler or other act and there will be a lot of loud drumming. I really do recommend the freshly pressed orange juice before you wander into the souk which is so large that you are liable to get lost and have to ask your way back to the square. If you press on to the further edges you will find area where the craftsmen work to supply the stalls. There you can find the famous Moroccan leather being processed from raw skins to the dyed article. There are metalworkers, welders, lampshade makers, basket makers et al.. Though tempting to take photos and videos it is not the done thing and you will be waved away or even have you view blocked. It is a courtesy to observe this rule. Incidentally there are no restrictions on motor vehicles or handcarts in the souk or in the square. The drivers weave in and out of the pedestrians with great skill but it is as well to keep an eye open behind you. I am pleased to say that despite the apparent chaos one does not see any 'road rage' . We could learn a lot from that.Returning to the square towards evening you will see that the hawkers are being replaced by covered stalls surrounded by bench seats. This is for the nightly feasting. The food is traditional Moroccan fare. The food is very cheap and good and the cooking is quite a sight itself with steam and flames being very photographic. You may have a little pestering to sit at a table but it is not too persistent. One view of the square can be found from the terraces above restaurants overlooking the square. Seeing the sun go down behind Koutubia Mosque and hearing the muezzins call to prayer is memorable. It is just surprising that you don't see anyone praying. But maybe they are all foreigners !"

Sit on one of the upper terraces of the square's restaurants and order a drink then and watch the food stalls setting up ready for the evening 'dining experience'. Eating here should not be missed, the food ranges from prawns, squid, chicken /lamb skewers , and local couscous and salads . All freshly cooked there and then . You will be hounded to sit at one of the food stalls , but walk around them first and choose they food you best like the look of . Prices are very cheap and food tasty.

I had a lot of expectation for the Jemaa el Fna square, it sounded like it would be a place that would leave us with amazement but on arrival it was a bit under whelming and a bit of a reality check.The bad ----The square had a few ladies sitting on stools saying 'hola' but realising i wasn't spanish said 'hey', at least they are linguistic. Then i saw a guy throwing a snake around like it was a belt and then two children going inside bins to empty them on the back of horse drawn carriage but how the horse was still standing I don't know. It was so dirty with its tongue hanging out desperate for a drink.The ugly----Then I saw monkeys being swung up and around by the chain around their neck dressed in all kinds of attire and why? Because tourists pay to have photos taken with both the snakes and the monkeys. As a person who likes animals it was quite a sad feeling to see all this and my first impression of the square was that it broke my heart.I realize the people of Marrakech need to live and the signs of poverty around this square was too evident and a feeling of powerlessness to help was overwhelming. Traditional berber people trying to make a living in any way they can, people with mental illness begging with tissues, children as young as 7 and old women without legs asking me for money for food that is the reality of the square and I was not blind to the facade of what really is going on.The Good -----Now the bad side is out the way let me discuss the good. The food stalls are absolutely delicious and the people who try to entice you onto the stalls are always laughing, joking and friendly. The impression I have of the Moroccan people are the majority are very good people that most of the time, make you feel welcome. Watching the people set up the market stalls standing on pieces of rod and preparing large mounds of mint and fresh spices is quite a sight to behold. The evening is definitely the time to see this place.Overall, if you are in Marrakech, you have to experience the square but it wasn't the most breathtaking place I've been to in the world. Okay if you can turn a blind eye to extreme poverty and animal mistreatment."

The children who were trying to sell things in the evening were a bit more persistent. There were snake charmers but the snakes didn't appear to move much and there were performing monkeys on chains but I found seeing them like this distressing. There were water sellers in full costume, keen to be photographed, and presumably charged for this. The nuts and dates sold in the square are worth buying. We enjoyed having lunch or a drink in the cafes in the square and sitting watching it all. Some of them have balconies which are ideal for watching and photographing. The best caf\u00e9 we found for lunch in the square is called Seven Saints. Good service and excellent tagines !"

We walked up to the square from the Kasbah on our first afternoon and naively fell for just about every trick in the book. We were called over to buy orange juice (a big thing in Marrakech) and the guy tried to short-change me from a 200 Dirham note (about \u00a315, but it's hard to get small change when you first arrive - no-one wants to give you change). It took the guy 4 separate goes to give me the right change. Getting annoyed will not help you. I just kept handing the money back smiling and saying 'more' until he got bored and gave me the right change. He'd expected me to get bored as he served other people inbetween. I didn't. Then my partner was near enough lassoed by a dead or anaesthetised snake which a guy came toward us dangling. We laughed as he approached and he touched it to my partners hand for luck, his head for health and then looped it over his neck and pulled him in with a practiced grin for a photo. He asked for 200 Dirhams for the photo. We grinned back and gave him 20 Dirhams, and he shook my partner's hand. Ladies tried to henna my hand with a 'small flower' as I walked and I learned to keep an eye for them approaching. The whole thing is street theatre, from the acts to the salesmanship, and you just need to roll with it and smile. If you get really up-tight about this kind of thing, Marrakech probably isn't the place for you. We left the square that first evening, having sat looking down on the view from a caf\u00e9 for a while, feeling thoroughly educated.By the second time we went a few days later, I actually loved it. The square is a fabulous slice of life with the huge Koutoubia mosque as a back-drop. You need a smile, to be aware of who you make any kind of lasting eye contact with or who is approaching you, and a firm but friendly \"Non, merci\", but nothing more. There are snake charmers and acrobats that perform for the ground floor cafes and then pass round a Fez for donations. If you reach for your camera, expect to reach for your wallet and some small change. The locals are hyper-aware of being photographed and it's polite to ask. I asked many people, from stall-holders to people in the street, offering a coin if it looked like it might be helpful, and few said no. Some did say no, but better find that out before you aim the camera at them! Some asked to see the picture and were good humoured about it. Looking down at the square from a roof-top terrace caf\u00e9 (e.g. Caf\u00e9 de France), particularly approaching dusk, is magical. Circles of people - mainly Moroccan - form and disperse around magic acts and the like. There is smoke and food stalls and a great atmosphere. The square also leads into the souks. A must see."

A man sitting at the entrance of the toilet, charges 5 dirhams to use it. On the way to Jemma el fina, there are local banks, and staffs are happy to exchange the big notes to smaller notes and coins, which is needed if going shopping at the market.The juice stalls at the square serve either freshly squeezed orange juice at 4 dirhams (30 pence) per glass or grapefruit juice 10 dirhams (75 pence). At night the place is manic. The food stalls dominate the area, full of smoke. The stall holders try to tempt you to eat at their stalls. They do not have running water. Also the food is not cheap. They cost the same as the restaurants nearby."

It's huge and after you've negotiated the snake charmers and the monkeys dressed as children, Yikes! And wondered over to the food stalls which I thought were totally insane when viewed through my eyes as the vendors are pretty aggressive in their sales patter though on the whole good natured. By then you'll need a decent coffee just to unwind ruminate on all the sights and sounds, smells and the rest of it. In my case well away from the square! All in all well worth the hassle."

The over priced food on stalls (side streets locallly sell the same things better and cheaper- and the hygeine is better) was let down for us as a visit by the local rabbit catcher encouraging the chef to examine the rabbits and then continue cooking- 3 days of very upset stomachs ensued. HAssled at every moment by people unwiulling to take a simple no for answer.Got offered something nice to smoke more than once. Its overrated."

The cutlery was unwashed so bring your own or eat with your hands. I ate from stalls 1 (the better of the two) and 25.To summarise you must see at both day and night as the square is unrecognisable.

I became more alert as the space between my wife and the person beside her narrowed. My wife shifted a bit left for a better view. I watched carefully, and sure enough again the person beside her closed the space. Now on high alert I watched his hand. He started carefully sliding it closer to my wife's pocket.

The Jemma-el-Fna is a huge open market area, tapering West to East, on the edge of the medina and immediately south of the warren of lanes that make up the souks. The key for us was to go prepared, both physically and mentally. That done, it's huge fun and an eye-opening experience. So, what preparation? Go with the minimum of valuables, although it doesn't feel unsafe, but it helps you to relax. We were told that pickpockets can be very active, especially at night but it shouldn't stop you. We saw nothing at all that worried us, but don't be complacent. Don't carry too many bags, you'll be focusing on them rather than the amazing sights and sounds all around you. As a tourist, you'll stand out, but you won't be alone - there will be hundreds at least, there with you, looking, browsing, bargaining or just taking it all in.Mentally, just be prepared to relax and accept that you will be invited to spend your money at every turn, whether to have an orange juice, to have a nappy-clad monkey sit on your shoulder or to be draped in a snake or two. You don't have to of course. It's easiest and very effective to keep a distance from the traders if you don't wish to indulge, to say a polite 'no', to avoid stopping to converse and to remain polite but firm and to keep walking. This worked very well for us this week. But lots of visitors do want to be part of the action. We did bargain for some cheap jewellery. If doing so it might be useful to remember you could find yourself bargaining over a pound or less, hardly worth the effort in some cases, but neither should you be fooled.We also learned that once you start bargaining, you're pretty much committed to buying at whatever price, so stop to engage the traders in conversation only if they have something you intend buying in the first place. We found the traders to be less pushy in the square than in the souks and they generally accepted a no thanks in arabic, which I can't spell -sorry - and a smile. We needed to be firmer in the souks but it wasn't unpleasant as long as we stuck to the few self-imposed rules above.The square really comes alive after dark, full of drumming,colours, the smell of spices and incense, the shouting of traders and the crowds, both local and from abroad. We got a great night-time view from the top floor terrace of the Cafe de France. Have a coffee there by all means, but don't eat there- see other reviews.The Jemaa el Fna is a must-do, but with a little care. Underneath the surface, it has a hard edge to it. As a visitor, we get just a tiny glimpse, but you get the sense that life is pretty tough for many,, that most are canny and have found a way to survive, that only a few, and they do exist, have done very well indeed, and that poverty is very evident indeed. If you're a little wary, it's safe and certainly worth the trip."

Food was inedibleSeven States - 7/10 Reasonably friendly staff and good foodCafe Premice - 5/10 poor service, Ok foodTaj'in Darna - 8/10 good food and good service...but cats everywhere!On the plus side, they serve the best orange juice in the square and you cant not visit it at least once!"

This main square in the centre of the Medina is home to a throng of snake charmers, monkey handlers, story tellers, henna tattooists, and musicians, as well as spice, fruit, souvenir, and food stalls. By day the square is relatively tame, but at night it comes alive. Keep you wits about you to avoid any unwelcome attention from the many vendors, or at worst pick pockets, and stroll around taking in the unique atmosphere. Daunting to some, make the effort and you will be rewarded with a uniquely Moroccan experience to remember !"

It was not fun! What struck me was the aggressiveness of the folks who wanted money. Any eye contact at all was an invitation for them to not only approach but to hound for money. Don't even think of taking a photo, you will be immediately approached and berated to give money. When you give them a few dirhams, it is not enough! They act terribly insulted at such a measly amount. The snake charmers, men with monkeys on leashes, and woman painting henna designs on hands watch for families and encourage the children to touch the animals and before you know it you are being asked to pay. It was disturbing to see the monkeys, in particular being hauled up by the leashes around their necks. They tried to hold the leashes away from their necks, one can only assume it was painful from them. The snakes were out on the ground and unceremoniously dunked into buckets of water or tucked under lids, poked, and slung around necks of tourists. It was all a bit of a sorry situation. One of visits which was positive, was during the evening when the food vendors were there. We had a Moroccan guide with us who thankfully shepherded us through the huge crowds and helped us order a delicious meal from the food vendors! That being said, there are other places to get delicious food. Jemaa el Fna is a victim of it's popularity with tourists which brings out the less desirable element."

Be very careful of your wallet and purse and cell phone here. We did not have any trouble, but we were careful. The other attraction is the food stalls. We got big glasses of freshly squeezed orange juice for 5 dirham. The signs say 4 but they charge you an extra for the plastic cup. It is cold but you it's because the oranges are chilled before they are squeezed, not because of ice cubes which you should avoid. You can sit down at long tables with benches and have a pretty good meal very cheaply. We paid 50 dirham for a full meal with fresh bread, kebabs of beef or chicken, various salads and cold water. For dessert you can buy cookies or the special tea which is spicy and delicious. Another speciality is snails- you can buy a small or large portion.

Without it's religion Islam ,I do not know what would become of this City.Unlike others on here,we did not find the Morrocan men aggressive...they tried to charm us complementing me and my daughter, but they do this to extract money from your wallet..thats it...this is a place where the silly little tourist is just prey for the clever Moroccans,the man in our Riad warned us and those were his words. At night,the place takes on a sinister air...our riad was in the middle of the Medina and even though we were warned to be careful we got a bit lost and let a young man help us ..he led us the wrong way and demanded money!! this happened more than once. everytime we stopped to look at a map young men /boys who seemed lovely would try to \"help\" us claiming to only be helping,they would not take no for an answer and then demand money!! whatever you do get a good street map and ensure you know where you are going! Learn how to say NO...go away.The place stinks....the poor animals are everywhere, limp snakes,being poked and dragged about, stinking, filthy horses stood in the sun,monkeys in dresses and sunglasses being thrust at people who were stupid enough to pose with them.Only to be stuffed into a box in the heat with dozens of others!Tortoises stuffed into cages with lizards,all with no food or water!The part of the market with animals in smelled so bad my stomach is still recoiling from the stench now!We fed a starving boy who came into the pizza place...and at every minute beggars approached us,kids,women with babies selling tissues,old ladies,blind men,cripples,whether we were eating in a restaurant or walking..it was absolutely relentless!!!! We gave money to some but it got ridiculous,,as soon as they see you give one person money you get inundated!!You cannot browse in any shop...they immediately descend upon you...most! If you go in a shop its unlikely you will leave without buying. We hardly saw anyone in the shops,the spices must be so stale as we saw hundreds of stalls but all the tourists just walk past.Too frightened and intimidated to stop. You cannot stop to watch or look at anything...a man will ask for money and don't even try to take a photo without having money ready,coins are regarded as money for babies they will expect at least 200 dh!The square looks lovely at night but it is filthy! The best place to see it all from is the roof terrace bars. we ended up eating pizza as we just felt everything was sooo dirty! the other good thing is the freshly squeezed orange juices from stall 48. Also we had to squeeze past piles of stinking gut renchingly revolting rubbish, we know its a third world country and they do not have sanitation etc but people here do not care,all they want is to climb over each other to make/con/deceive the tourists who are just rich pickings for these people. Especially with our white european faces! As another reviewer said these people are actors trained to trick you into trusting them,make you feel like you are getting a bargain and then fleecing you. They see us as rich people with money so do not feel at all bothered about it. Also we were conned by a henna woman..she was lovely and sweet and charged us 400 dh for green henna...we found out we shouldnt have paid more than 50 dh for 2 hands!! and the henna was black!I wanted to love Morocco, but was bitterly disappointed,bad traffic meant I nearly missed my plane there...I wish I had! The only good thing is that my teenage kids got to see how lucky they are to live in a civilised country,and the imprtance of honesty, integrity and compassion and what the world is really like without it! Oh yes if you are vegetarian there's only veggie coucous and pizza to eat there!!World Heritage site??? This is a God forsaken hell hole!!"

Even if you just happen to get a performer or snake or monkey in the corner of a photo a payment will be demanded of you \u2013 and it is a demand and not a polite request.There are street hawkers a plenty \u2013 if you don\u2019t want anything then be polite and move on. They are really not as bad as some people make out. The same goes for the stall holders \u2013 a polite no with a smile and move on.By night it is different. For food stalls, acrobats, story tellers etc. move in and take centre stage. Wafting of cooking food and smoke across the square. It has a different feeling that the day, but you should witness both during your stay.FOOD:The food stalls really are very good and there is no need to worry about food hygiene. Everything is cooked from fresh and done in front of your eyes. Do as the locals do and eat with your fingers (fresh bread rolls are provided) \u2013 the knives and forks are only rinsed in cold water. No alcohol is served so wash down with a fresh orange juice or a mint tea. We found number 31 to be very good, with a lot more locals than tourists as well. Don\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to try any of the snail stalls either. They really are very good and the broth that they are served in is excellent. And do not miss out on Fresh orange juice is excellent. They do take away or you can drink there. If you have a 1L empty bottle then they will fill that for you as well if you want.OTHER TIPS Pickpockets and bag dippers (especially at night). Ladies \u2013 turn the flap of your handbag towards your body and have the bag to the front of your body. Keep bags and any valuables on your lap when sitting down to eat at the food stalls. Locals do a good job of looking out for you \u2013 we were warned that our wives bags were being targeted by a couple of youths, and we hadn\u2019t noticed a thing. We travel a lot and are used to bag security as well. But generally this whole area and the souks are safe any time of day and night.Side restaurants (permanent ones) \u2013 the lads working these places at night are extremely persistent. Don\u2019t be bullied or forced into one of these at night \u2013 there is far far better food available at the temporary food stalls. Keep walking and they soon get fed up following you along the square.Is this the \u201cGreatest Show on Earth\u201d as described by some of the Guidebooks? That would be a resounding no. It is a must see / experience when in Marrakech \u2013 an absolute yes, especially at night."

I'd like not to be cynical, but any authentic culture that may have once existed on the Jemaa likely died in the 1970s. Paul Bowles, when he was alive, told a story about witnessing a Moroccan man (who frequented the Jemaa) whose imitation of a goat was so uncanny that Bowles swore that the man before his eyes was in fact a goat. One would be hard-pressed to find such a \"performer\" in the Jemaa today. What there is a glut of snake-\"charmers\" and monkey-\"handlers\" and sheisty West African street salesmen vying desperately for one's hard-earned tourist dollar, which I find repugnant, even in a country as burdened by poverty as Morocco. Go at night; it's much more pleasant to deal with the food-sellers and the street urchins selling tissues than with [word-redacted] rip-off artists."

The noise, smells, tastes & sights of the place was an immediate assault on the senses. A maelstrom of humanity, with perfromers, tourists, locals & stalls conspiring to create a throbbing vitality that we had never experienced before, despite being well travelled. A sight to behold & I suggest it should be on your \"things to do before....\" list. Top tips:1. Savour the orange juice stalls - fresh & delightfully quenches the thirst.2. Secure a seat on the open terrace [3rd-floor] of the Cafe de' France which can provide panoramic views of the square [best at night].3. Easy access from the square to the 'souks'.4. If you attempt to take pictures you may be 'accosted' for a 'donation'.5. Efforts by traders to sell their wares may be 'forthright' by western conventions, but if you are not interested simply smile, avoid eye-contact, utter a polite 'no-thank you' & move on.6. Agree taxi fares before getting in - ours, for the 10-minutes journey, ranged from 50Dirhams to 100Dirhams.7. Haggle over prices - on the flight to Marrakesh a UK resident of Morrocan decent kindly mentioned that, particularly in 'the souks', you should look to negotiate down by anything from 50%-75% - we secured a leather bag at 60% less than the initial asking price [persevere, it took time, but we got there & to be honest enjoyed the experience - which the trader no doubt did as he still looked as though he had achieved a good deal!].8. We travelled in October to avoid searing heat, yet still enjoyed warm but comfortable temperatures that would put the UK summer to shame.9. Enjoy!10. Go - you know you want too!"

From late afternoon every day jugglers, tumblers, musicians, snake charmers, monkey-handlers, vendors (of anything) and even an open air dentist assemble to entertain you and endeavour to part you from your money - in the nicest possible way.... At the same time, mobile orange juice vendors align their stalls and cry our for custom from all passers by. Their chilled juices are delicious and inexpensive, typically 4 Dirhams (about 35 pence UK, or USD 0.50 approx) but be aware that the juice is usually watered down ( happily with bottled water) but it is still refreshing on a hot day.Later in the afternoon, large mobile food stalls are wheeled, with much puffing and panting, into their respective places and rapidly swing into action preparing excellent brochettes, soups,and tasty tajines for all who would like to enjoy supper in the fresh air surrounded by the noise, smoke and general chaos! Delightful!Be aware that every enthusiastic individual who offers to star in your photographs will expect a monetary \"thank you\" - usually 10 Dirhams - but they will always try for more! So make sure you have plenty of loose change but spread it between several pockets in case you are in a \"that's all I have\" situation...The whole smokey, noisy and colourful carnival continues until very late in the night - and starts again the next day!

We took a stroll from our hotel (the Pearl) of about 15mins on our first night in Marrakech. It really is the 'go-to' place for locals and tourists alike. I would say the main thing to be wary about, is the fact that there are lots of children trying to sell your items and they will follow you! The best thing as harsh as it seems is to just ignore them. I also had one lady so desperate to show me her henna tattoo work that she actually grabbed my wrist and gave me a dot on my hand... I think the look on my face said it all!!! My partner and I were trying to subtly take some photos on our mobile phones when a couple of guys in costume offered to take photos for us and then pictures of us together with them, this would have been fine only they then expected payment for their 'services' & they were reluctant to leave us alone until we had given them something, I think the only change we had was probably equivalent to a penny! Still, regardless of these experiences, it is a very interesting place to wonder around and as the sunsets it really becomes much more vibrant. We did buy some fresh orange juice off of one of the stalls and I must say it was lovely. The Medina can feel very intimidating at times but I would say that I never felt particularly threatened or unsafe even with my experiences."

It is a pity that they still chain animals such as monkeys up, to have their photo taken for a fee, but if we all boycott doing that then they will give up if there is no money in it. If you see a crowd of people gathered, stow your wallet carefully and go and have a look: it may be a card trickster or local magician, they are always good at sleight of hand - and of course, remember that they always win!"

If you push back i found they went away fairly swiftly. I did not find this square or Marrakesh itself in anyway unsafe or aggressive. Marrakesh itself is an extremely busy city but its worth remembering the serious crime rates here are pretty low with one of the lower homicide rates in the world. Personally i think a lot of this is to do with the religious life style of the people here. The square at night is alive with lights, trade cooking and culture. A must see both at night and during the day, 2 very different experiences !!!!"

I loved the colours, sights, smells and genuine other worldliness of every step along the way to Jemaa el Fna. The stalls in the souks and the winding streets are beautiful and walking through I didn't feel too harassed at any point until a young chap with arms covered in scars and clearly off his face on drugs approached me and wouldn't leave me alone. Some of the older men came to my rescue and apologised for his behaviour which I appreciated. We met a lovely stall owner who had the banter of a stall owner in London when he called \"Come and have a butchers at my awesome swag!\" - we had a chat and updated him on some new phrases from the UK and he told us if we ever got lost in the souk, all we had to do was look up for the red signs and we would find our way out - this turned out to be great advice!So far I was falling in love with the magic of the souks....then we reached the main square Jemma El Fna...This place was aggressive, noisy and full of drugged up snakes, terrified and abused monkeys, and every con artists in the country trying their very best to steal your money. I had been warned about the animal abuse, but to see a monkey screaming in pain as its owner beats it with a stick and yanks on the metal chain round its throat is heartbreaking. The line of horses and carts was a mixture of relatively healthy animals to poor souls covered in sores and dying of hunger. I know that when in foreign countries you cannot expect they same levels of animal welfare we take for granted in the UK, but as an animal lover I found this really upsetting and had to get away from there before I got myself into trouble.My advice - explore the souks. Drink tea and chill out in a hidden cafe. Soak up the sights and sounds and don't be afraid to interact with the owners there - most are pretty friendly. BUT. Avoid Jemaa el Fna, the main square, at all costs. Unless of course, animal cruelty, threatening behaviour, and getting scammed is you thing, in which case you'll love it!"

We took a seat on the roof top of the Caf\u00e9 de Paris and marvelled at the speed that everything is assembled and how organised they are. ..this really is a must see. We then went down to eat at one of the stalls. We chose a meat tagine. ..in hindsight the brochettes (kebabs) would have been a better choice. The second time we ate the egg and potato roll only because everyone else was! Delicious; filling and dirt cheap as it's for the locals. ..we were the only tourists tucking in! Our final visit was to do what most people do and enjoy a barbecued kebab with delicious salads. We also tried the tea stands with the cocoa paste sweet stuff. Not to my taste but the tea was a spiced version of mint tea and right at the end he popped some menthol powder into it. ...wow! !!!We drank orange juice each time and bought dates and almonds and had no adverse reactions. In our experience there was no hassle; we have visited Tunisia, Egypt and Agadir and have had far more 'encouragement' to buy! !Everyone we met was friendly and respectful. ..you get out of life what you put in."

It was a good experience so we took a walk around and the henna ladies with their syringes full of henna and brandishing books of photos were persistent but I firmly said no. I did not want a picture with sad looking monkey or other traders. We walked to the square when it was Eid, there were crowds of locals celebrating there with lamps various activities going on.

Everywhere you look there is something different going on. There is a real buzz about the place, there is a constant sound of music which includes the snake charmers pipes, it is almost like we are hearing the pulse of this great square.In the evening there is a different atmophere, there are lots more people about, the music is louder, more stalls and sellers, people dancing and loads of food and eating areas. The steam can be seen from the great pot, like woks, cooking up tons of cockles. This place is amazing both by night and day and worth a visit.A word of warning don't let anybody put a snake or monkey on you for a photograph as they will want money before removing it.This review does not do the square justice, the only thing I can say is go and see for yourself and enjoy."

There not! Marrakech is by far the most boring, overpriced and overrated city I've ever been to. And the square is supposed to be the highlight of the city, its a joke! only not a funny one. Yes its packed with hundreds of Morrocans who seem to mesmerised by some guy in a dress (the main at traction in the square) , he dosent actualy do anything but they like him nonetheless. Then there's the snake charmers dressed in traditional Morrocan nike tracksuits, the snakes are either drugged or stuffed it's hard to say because their not very animated. I could go on but suffice to say that Jemaa el Fna was an incredibly underwhelming experience and if you absolutly have to go to Marrakech then one day is enough. You can literally see the city in an afternoon. See my posts on how awful the food is and how unfriendly the people are."

It has something for everyone, a unesco site. by day there are monkeys and snake charmers plus the usual market and souks etc.there are also the brightly coloured water sellers. all geared for the tourist but by night it all changes, the are story tellers but these are for the locals and large crowds gather around, they also hold special events and shows here, one of the nights we were there there was Imichil Marriage Festival. Very traditional. a great find and purley by chanceEvery September, one of Morocco's Berber tribes holds a celebration whose origins are linked to a story reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet. Lured by the legend, and by North Africa's vibrant music, its a 3 day event and worth a visita lot of people complain about being hasseled here day and night, we were there for 10 days and didn't find it to bad at all I experienced a lot worse in places like Egypt etc. Don't let these reports put you off..

During the day, there is little to see, with perhaps a couple of stalls and a snake charmer. At night, though, it comes alive, with tradesmen wherever you look and a vibrant cultural feel about the place with may smells and things to see (try the orange juice!) I would advice travelling in a group with at least 2 adults, preferably more, and if possible a Moroccan tour guide. A must-see in Morocco is Jemaa el Fna at night, preferably eating a mela overlooking the square - an experience to remember!"

Now though it lack authenticity with the target audience firmly tourists. Take them away and this place fades into the ashes of a formerly bright fire. It was once the centre of life in the city, not any more. Local people have other entertainment.The main purpose of the entertainers is to procure money for photographs. Although why someone wants a picture of a monkey on their shoulder needs some examination. These monkeys have a hard, stressful and shameful history. Taken from their mothers at birth, often after killing the mother and other members of the family trying to protect them. For the sole purpose of using them to secure money from unwitting tourists unaware of there history. Please don't take photos or even worse pay for the privilege. You will find the charm transforms to something far more ugly if you don't play along. So make it clear that you disapprove of animal cruelty and don't prolong animal mistreatment by paying to participate in this distasteful entertainment."

There is also a night food market, but I was advised against eating there by the Riad I was staying in, as running water is scarce in the square, but essential to the preperation of food.

As other reviews have said, stay away from the snake charmers and this is where the most 'aggressive' selling techniques are employed. It is however not to be missed. We had no problems the whole time we were walking around Jemaa el Fna but you can see how people might. The food in the square is enthusiastically pushed by multi-lingual men. If you smile and laugh along with them then they are generally pleasant. We settled for one individual who on learning I was from London, England launched into an extremely convincing London accent and reeled off many obscure locations in London. We are a sucker for a good salesman. So we sat down ordered the tagine and were surprised at the price. That was until the food came, it was edible but lacked any of the flavour we are now use to in Morocco. It is well worth several visits just to immerse yourself fully into the mind-blowing exotic flurry of life the square has to offer."

The sounds, colours, smells it's a cacophony of everything that sends your senses alive. Thinking back on our days there we began to love it and I can't help smile at all the memories and sites. In the evening it's wonderful to watch the street caf\u00e9s come alive and the craziness of it all. Actually the souks were incredible with over 4000 stalls. I even had my shoes repaired. We bought masses. It was a memory that will stay with us for ever.

I went to take a picture on my camera of a band in the square. It was a rubbish picture as there was lots of people surrounding them however I was surrounded my the band to pay them. Which I expected so handed them some change however I wasn't aloud to go till we paid 50 dirhams which is around \u00a39. Which was ridiculous since I didn't even get a proper picture but it was that intimidating we had to pay. For the rest of et trip I just kept my phone in my bag. We ate at the food stalls at night time 3 times. 117 and 114. Both were delicious and no funny Tummys after. We would have ate there more if we could afford it. It's not as cheap as you may think. Deffinetly worth a visit!!!!"

It may once have been a glorious example of heritage but is now just a massive tourist trap. From the snake charmers to monkeys chained to their owners this was a past to humanity I want the world to forget. When reading a guide book I was worried when the no 1 thing to do at Jemma El fna was ' try the orange juice stand'. I gave it the benefit of doubt but it was that bad. During the day the main square was a mass of juice stands, henna artists, tarot readers, snake charmers, monkey abusers, and horse carriages. If you stay away from the animals and reptiles you will avoid the common complaint of being forced to take part. I am no animal rights activist but even the abuse here offended me.We ate at a rooftop terrace 'cafe de france' which was horrible food, and watched the square transform overnight where the food vendors setup. We went for walk through the food stalls and have never been hassled in all my life. Had to stop my mini tour and abandon any thoughts of eating there because of the hassle. All in all a poor focal point for any city and relic of a time we all wish to forget about."

I only had one incident with one woman grabbing my hand and painting henna on it telling my partner that she was \"giving good luck to his wife\" I kept saying no while she was doing it but she wouldn't let go of my hand, and after she demanded payment from my partner we just said \"we said no\" and walked away. The snakes, monkey and turtles are unfortunate and you can't do anything about as animal welfare is not the same in every country, my suggestion is just to avoid these stalls so not to encourage it."

There were several groups with monkies (with nappies on) and some 'snake charmers' with snakes. The snakes were cobras and I think I saw some puff adders, they weren't really doing anything, which concerned me as I'm not sure why. The night was mental! Very fun, the street market stalls were so much fun, the food was good and cheap and the entertainment was out of this world. There were the most random things to see (man with chicken on his head!), dancers, music, story-telling, fortune telling, henna. It's very busy, but definitely worth a visit for the experience, even if crowds really aren't your thing. I described it as a 'mini - festival'.

In one of the crowded souks two men on a motorbike deliberately bumped into my wife to put her off balance but she was too quick and stepped back as one made a grab for the bag she had on her shoulder. In a flash they had disappeared into the crowd. Riding motorbikes along crowded footpaths and in the souks is the norm, not the exception in Morocco. Also, expect to pay if you let the snake charmers put the pythons around your neck (they will try whether you say yes or no). They demanded 100 MAD from me and became quite aggressive when I told them no. Eventually, after several tense minutes of arguing, I gave them 25 MAD and left, quickly. Be ready to be hassled by the stall owners.

We have been a few times, and I never get fed up with the square.See it change and come alive at night, with the story tellers, anyone that wants to do anything does this in the square, we saw men dressed as belie dancers, snake charmers, sot of tag type boxing, discussions, music, drums, all the people.Eating in the square, go on risk it if you dare to eat at the white tented portable restaurants, its a sort of meza, so order a few dishes as they are small, but well worth it, sit on one of the roof terraces and watch all the fun from above its mesmerising.You can not drink alcohol in the square, but it doesnt matter.You have to haggle hard, they do think all tourists have a lot of money, and they don't like coming under a 100DHR, thats around 8.50 Euro, even if its worth it or not, it is easy to get carried away n negotiations, and I have noticed over the time coming hear, that they defiantly want more for the goods then before, but thats inflation, lots of imported stuff and also hand made Moroccan stuff, they will start at stupid prices to throw you thin k what its worth to you and stick with that, the spice square is a great place to go for a coffee the smells are fantastic, I always buy Amba block and oil as its a lovely smell, you can walk around for hours, having a chat, they all sell the same things but its just lovely looking and buying if your a woman !!, Silver jewellery is great lots off it, again haggle hard, as they think they are selling you gold ha ha, its fun, and I often got called Berba lady!! oh well, i explained we also work hard for this money.I felt very save hear, i am blond and blue eyes and i was with my husband, and still caused a stir, but did were a scarf at night, in the day just shorts and vest, and that was fine.Its not a place to put your glad rags on, maxi dress are good really.Have fun"

On the advice of our Riad we went to the Cafe Glacier terrace at 5:30pm to watch the stalls setting up for the night. You pay 20DH for a soft drink, but it seemed worthwhile to be able to view the activity below."

You must visit this place bustling with musicians playing authentic music street performers,market traders, snake charmers, more street performers surrounded by crowds and henna tattooists all out to rip you off . if your European they want your money and as much as they can blag out of you. The price starts high and is not cheap with counterfeit goods everywhere genuine copies they will tell you,make sure you start very low when they give you a price aim for a third of what they are asking for is what you want to pay.walk around and everyone wants to show you what they have hastle is not the word,smile and say no thank you then keep walking as they follow you up the street, take a photo and they demand money. We walked off the square through the narrow streets with mopeds scathing past us every other minute horns bibbing,keep your wits about you as you will be going on a magical mystery tour. we found ourselves walking down passages off the square, a left then a right and before we knew it we were away from the tourists and in the land of the Moroccans all wanting to be your guide and yes wanting money,sending you left,right,not a nice place to be lost with sense of direction gone looking the same and no landmarks to be seen with the high walls and narrow passages and the stench of leather at 34 degrees at 8.30 pm it's sweltering hot Horse and carts squeezing by and street sellers trying to drag you in to buy goods After about an hour and half and asking shop owners the way back Being sent on a wild goose chase We finally got back to the square seeing other tourists on the way looking out of place and also lost we had mad it with a feeling of a safer place in the open my wife hated it as it was not her thing Luckily our hotel was ten minutes away, I love the markets but let me tell you I could not wait to get out back to the hotel and relax maybe I will try on the day time which I did by myself the mrs declined the 2 nd visit.Going earlier in the morning is a better time to go having learnt my lesson from the evening visit,the daytime was a little clearer to me I could see where I was going and knew if I walk up a passage to walk back don't take the left and rights as it's like a maze, I stopped at a rooftop bar and got a cold drink watching the mad place get busier and busier.I haggled for a while in a shop for a few items starting price 1800 dogs bought it for 600 and headed back certainly an overload to the brain but worth the experience.My friend was also there with his girlfriend and told me on his evening visit someone tried to mug him demanding money so have your eyes open they befriend you but want your money. I went out clubbing in the new town and went to the so bar very good place on a rooftop by the casino live music had a great night. Went to the VIP club down the street 200 dhs \u00a315 for a small bottle of Heineken rip off or what stayed for a while and went back to the hotel free beer there all inclusive is a must it is very expensive for drinks being it is a dry county. Would I go back yes if it was a free holiday but would I pay to go back I don't think so . Read my review on medina garden the couples hotel we stayed at 10 minute walk from the hustle and bustle of the markets"

Next thing she grabbed my hand and started with the ink. I continuously told her I have no money with me. Then the price jumped to 500 dirham and when she finished it was a 1000 dirham.she and her \"sister\" kept following me around screaming that I had better pay. This went on for about five minutes and thank goodness I was pretty close to the tourist police office and went straight there to report the incident. Everywhere you go someone is trying to get money off of you for any and everything. Even the snake charmer tried to make me take a picture up close which I refused as I had heard they sneak and place them around people's necks and ask for payment to remove it. I wasn't going to literally risk having heart attack or fainting (literally) for that. He accused me of taking a photo which I did not and started shouting that I owed him money. I got the hell out of there. This square is only worth going to if you're going to Cafe Glaces for drinks and watch the crowds from above especially at night. My grade: D"

Unfortunately even small children are sent out to try and sell you things. One little boy of maybe 5 years old would not leave us alone. The older children kept egging him on. Very sad. Even after we gave him some coins he stayed. Poor thing.Also be ware of pick-pockets and people proposing to get henna hand-drawings. Some friends got taken in by it and the price soared, and in addition it was not even real henna, perhaps some sort of ink.Only get henna done through people you know or through your Riyad or hotel.

Having been told of the wonderful jugglers and acobats I would see I saw just a few who performed a few tricks at one edge of the square for about five minutes and then they were gone.

If you are at all into history, music, culture, simply do not miss this place at night. Touts? Yes. You need to have your thick tourist-skin on, comparable to India/Nepal style touting, but not quite as intense. Dodgy food? Sure, and oh my, did I get sick. I mean, vomit-fever-delirium-for-2-days sick. I rolled the dice on a delicious mutton, walnut, and fig tagine. That was some serious stuff...But it was all worth the spectacle and the adrenaline rush of the Djemma, a phenomenon that dates back hundreds of--maybe a thousand or more--years, of music, trade, and story telling, folks from all over the Maghreb and even across the Sahara, creating this convergence of cultures that are still living and breathing in this square. The sights of belly dancers, snake charmers, and flashes of fire and smoke pouring from the food stalls, this is why I travel. And the music was particularly fascinating to me (a music nerd), reminiscent of west African, Arabian, Berber, Andalusian and even a little rock influence, which sounded especially eerie coming from distorted amps. Jump in, join the crowds, try the snails and a glass of fresh orange juice--just make sure you eat where the crowds are, and not where the nice but lonely man begs you to eat. Old mutton will take you right out of the game, and that's no fun. Found a new appreciation for mint tea and those round seeded buns, anyways. So, it's a win-win."

The food stall waiters are incredibly in your face pushy, my children got very upset by the relentless harassment. I was really looking forward to eating on the evening food stalls after Jamie Oliver had raved about them in a TV programme a few years back. Both stalls we tried tagines and barbecued meat skewers. Each time we were disappointed with the flavour and the quality of the meat. Relatively bland and flavourless.We had much better tagines and lamb + chicken skewers in some of the restaurants + cafes around the square. Our favourite was a small cafe called Snack Issafen. Whilst it appeared initially to only offer sandwiches + paninis, they do in fact do an awesome beef+prune tagine. So good I had it 3 times in the 7 days I was there. Really delicious sweet and sour sauce, I mopped the tagine dry with my bread each time. My kids are fussy eaters and they initially stuck to the Spaghetti bolognese and chicken Paninis - which they really enjoyed. My daughter loves Spag Bol and she thinks this was one of the best ones she has ever had! The lamb + chicken skewers were also cooked perfectly and full of flavour as was the Couscous I tried once.The stalls selling merchandise were a great mix of tacky, ripoff and cheap. Some stalls charging twice as much as the next stall for the exact same item. My wife bought several kaftans for just 40MAD each - absolute bargain!Night time this place gets crazy packed and absolutely buzzing with life - western tourists, Moroccan tourists, snake charmers, hawkers - an absolute buzz! We often bought mint tea and ice cream and sat and soaked up the energy."

Be sure to haggle over everything and don't think about starting at 50% of his listed price, start at 5%. But the Night Market, with all of the food stalls, is the absolute best. It took me days to get the courage to eat there but I'm glad I did. We had fresh seafood, beef, vegetarian dishes, and I even tried the peppery snail soup. Very tasty and clean. We ate all of our meals there for five days and deliberately tried as many stalls as possible for variety and to test how safe it was so we could recommend it to friends. Not a single problem. Of course, we used common sense. We ate primarily at busy stalls where we assumed food turnover was high and thus produce was fresh, and we had food that was cooked well and could be identified visually. And we didn't have any tap water or any salad that would be washed in tap water. But overall, it was fine and so worthwhile."

Of course they can be a little pushy to get you to enter their tent, but that's how ut is all around.

Have a rough price in your head before you enter a souk and stick to it. Motorbikes go flying down the narrow paths in the souks so watch your toes.I recommend wearing sunglasses so souk owners can't see you looking directly at their shop otherwise they swarm you (but in a non aggressive way) haha.Lots of cafes around the square so you can sit up high and get quality photos with a drink, it was just amazing taking in all the sights and smells.

They then demand money for this. My daughter and I got caught but I told them from the outset that I would not be paying them and did not. However, if you do feel obliged to pay, do not give more than 50 Dirham for one hand. They will ask for anything between 200-600 dirham. The main concern though, is that they tend to mix hair dyes with the henna, so you can never be sure what is in their mixture!"

As you approach the multiple food stalls which are set up in the evenings, you are harassed left, right and centre to eat at the respective stalls. One of the stall owners actually pushed my friend after he declined and attempted to prevent him from walking around his stall, and after I said no to another stall owner the guy swore at me and threw up his middle finger! Eventually we conceded and sat down at one place where unfortunately I had the worst tajine I've ever tasted (watery and bland, I think the vegetables were just cooked in plain stock) and had one mouthful of a chicken dish where the chicken was clearly off.The square just feels like an area that is there purely for the exploitation of tourists.

It is exactly how it is described in the Travel Guides with the Snake Charmers, Monkeys, Hustlers, Orange Juice Stalls etc. During the day, it can get very noisy and chaotic but in the evening, the Square turns into an open air restaurant with various food stalls. Based on the Tripadviser recommendations, my son and I ate at Food Stall N1 and the food was tasty. However, we also ate at N26 and the food was tastier and fresher and in my opinion N26 is better and wins!The Souks are amazing but remember to haggle. No matter the price you are quoted initially, you need to bargain hard, offer a much lower price and if they do not accept your price, walk away. You will be suprised at how quickly the Seller will call you back and accept your offer! I got some fantastic bargains as well. Be careful with the over friendly \"Samaritans\" who will offer to help you. They are after money and initially when you say no, they will walk away or ride along on their motorcycle or bicycle but they will come back after a few minutes. Say a firm \"No\" and they will leave you alone. You will also have to dodge Donkeys with Carts, Cyclists, Beggars etc but that is part of the experience and therefore comes with the Territory.One last advice, always agree the price of a Taxi from the Square before you get in the Taxi. I ended up paying one third of the initial fare offered each time and also on the return journey. I also told the driver to turn off the meter so that there was no confusion afterwards.Finally, have fun, be safe and enjoy your holiday!"

Firstly its the hub of Marrakech in my view, with a variety of stalls selling everything from souvenirs, bric a brad, local delicacies, fresh fruit, the most delicious mint teas; whilst its also surrounded by a variety of restaurants to suit all budgets. Great care is to be exercised in this part of town as with all places you might find the odd pick pocket, but please do not let this deter you as there is a police station right there in the middle of the square, they patrol the area on a regular basis and are very helpful. Here you can hire a horse drawn carriage should your budget permit, taking you on a ride round Marrakech particularly through the more affluent parts of town. The square comes so alive at night with fantastic entertainment coming from street artists, as well as the food traders who don't just sell food but entertain you with their wonderful techniques at getting customers which is just so humorous.

Grab a seat at one of the rooftop restaurants and enjoy the beautiful view as the sun sets. The souks are amazing! But beware of purchasing anything and be ready to haggle and barter! Always offer half of what the seller is trying to charge you for souveneirs and knickknacks. The snake charmers were a treat, but totally ripped off my boyfriend and I! We didn't realize until speaking with our friends the next day. Do grab some fresh juice from one of the juice vendors! It's so fresh and delicious! The experience at Jemaa el Fna is one of kind, you need to see, smell, and hear for yourself."

My two teenage sons had a Fez placed on their heads by two smiling men shouting 'Free picture', one son took a picture of the other and suddenly they changed, becoming aggressive about being paid for the photo. We had got separated by a few feet and came upon a scene that looked like our boys were being mugged. We had to pay them to leave. Also witnessed two men exchanging 5 or 6 mobile phones. No guessing where they came from. I would say visit for the experience but don't take a photo of anyone under any circumstances, stay on the outskirts of the square and get out quick."

Given the square is built up so highly in the books I was expecting something more exotic, its not all that special, but yes if you want a photo with a monkey or snake or your hands decorated with Henna its the main place in the evening. On the other hand another couple had Henna painted on their daughters hand before they had agreed to do it and ended up paying 4 times the going rate, also told by our excursion guide the next day that the black cobras with the hood are one crazy snake and not to be approached. So personally I found the experience best looking down from one of the restaurants overlooking the square, they weren't too pricey but did get VERY busy from around 8:30pm.Worth a visit, don't go to Marrakech just to see this !"

I saw an unsuspecting british couple take a photo of a man holding a monkey and then be chased down and hassled for money by a group of men. It is relatively busy during the day, full of tourists I expect there for the same reason I went. At night, it becomes a sort of food festival. Stalls and stalls of 'freshly cooked food'. I'm not convinced with the hygiene. The one thing the square does well are fresh orange juice..Other than that, there's no magic in this place. it's just a tourist trap and the locals make use of that with knock off goods (Dr dre beats headphones for the equivalent of 5 gbp) if you're into that.

Snake charmers, acrobats, monkeys and street sellers but beware if taking a photo as they don't take kindly and you will be chased for money (\u00a310.00 or more) for the photo. It is worth trying the street food which sets up at night we tried stall 100 which was good and had a varied choice. We were warned by our Riad not to eat any fish in Marrakech as it is not fresh and many people have problems. Also only eat at the street food stalls which have a licence (look for a number above the stall) and ones that are busy. Try the freshly squeezed orange juice at only 4 dirham (approx 30p) at one of the many stalls - again be careful it is not watered down. In the day the square is calmer and a super place to go is Cafe France - sit on the terrace at the top and watch the squares coming and goings with the Atlas Mountains as a spectacular back drop!Browse the many world famous souks which are just off the square and be prepared to bargain -start at a third off and aim for no more than half original cost. One more thing as everywhere else in Marrakech watch out for the many scooters, motor bikes whizzing up and down accidents do happen with unsuspecting tourists!!"

There is a whole lane with freshly-squeezed orange juice at only 4 dirhams, plus lots of ladies offering henna (but be careful as not all henna is safe).It's worth being brave and venturing along the narrow lanes - it's a gauntlet of street hawkers (watches, mobiles, hats for sale) and small cafes and, if you get lost, look to the roofs and follow the direction of the (hundreds or so!) satellite dishes that point back to the square."

Our Riad was only a 5 minute walk to the Jemaa El Fna, so we were able to take our time and check out this amazing place. If you are a cat lover, you cannot help but notice the feline friends enjoying themselves in secluded areas of the square.In the daytime, this square offers lots of places to purchase items, fresh squeezed orange juice and enjoy the snake charmers, barbary apes and other sights and sounds. You can walk up to a second floor cafe to get a great overview of the Jemaa El Fna, but the real action is on the ground level which a great mix of travelers visiting Morocco as well as Moroccans enjoying this famed location. Yes there are people offering to sell items, but I found this no more of a hassle than anywhere else in the world, including metropolitan areas throughout Europe, America, Asia, etc. The great thing is that bargaining is key in the square and I found people to be friendly and welcoming. As the bargaining proceeds and/or the purchases mount, be prepared to be offered and accept the gracious offering of complimentary mint tea offered in some of the souks.The Jemaa El Fna really comes alive at night when the square becomes a real communal gathering spot; friends and families meet up, the food stalls are set up and the entertainers go out in droves. You will see all manner of acrobats along with dancers and other forms of entertainment. Visiting the Jemaa El Fna is a must do if you visit Marrakech. Just standing and people watching is a transformative experience that reminds you that you are in a very special Kingdom. Enjoy!"

            "review": "Largest market-square in North Africa. No need to write a long review here -- if you come to Marrakech and don't visit this place, you're either very stupid or not actually in Marrakech. Practically everything revolves around it: trade, cuisine, travel, hospitality, worship...During the day snake-charmers, letter-writers and monkey-owners mingle with tourists and locals. There's a lot to see but if you're more animal-friendly, you may want to avoid the monkeys because of their questionable treatment by owners. Anyone putting something on you (a snake, a hat, a dress etc.) will expect payment for a photo with you and the object (you can just say 'non, merci' and walk off without paying if you'd rather not take part). These attractions go hand-in-hand with the beautifully fresh orange juice perfected in nearby stalls, costing around DH4 MAD per glass (made from Marrakech-grown oranges), which is a must-drink if you're visiting for the first time. By night, the snakes, monkeys and letters disappear and North Africa's largest market-square comes alive. Not only because a sea of locals carry portable stoves and setup the myriad restaurants (kebabs, tagines etc.) which cost very little to dine at (you should eat with your hands (make sure they're clean!) as cutlery isn't really washed thoroughly and bring your own water bottle to drink from) and are as authentic a Marrakech experience as you can get. The smoke fills the air and the smell of grilled lamb drifts for miles! Alongside these are magicians, henna tattooists (be warned, you need to agree a price before sitting down and no designs will ever be free, even if they promise they are -- you will be overcharged, I promise! Also, don't forget some henna can cause major allergic reactions) and lamp sellers (use a mobile phone light to illuminate the outside of the lamps before buying, as you may find an ugly, poorly-made lamp when you get back to your hotel/riad). There are also old women selling Jempo tissues and young boys throwing glow sticks in the air. Transport runs through the Djemaa El-Fna. Horses and carts sit by the water troughs on the bottom of the square, petit taxis (max. 3 people, often Dacias) and grande taxis (Mercedes, no max. passenger number) both wallow around with local motorbikes. An ALSA bus also drops off passengers nearby. A fare to your riad/hotel in Marrakech (all quarters except Palmarie) should be no more than DH20 MAD at a tourist rate. If you ask them to use the meter ('le compteur') it should be around DH10 MAD, but they may refuse (if so, you can look for another cab). Agree a price before getting in and shake on it (a gentleman's handshake is as important here as it is in London).The square also has two entrances to the souks, where you can find the usual tourist stuff -- lamps, tagines, teapots, scarfs etc. The further in you go, the better the stuff and the greater the discounts. Always haggle -- never pay the first price or anything more than list minus 50%. More on haggling can be found on my review of the souks. This is a must-see when coming to the red city. If you're visiting for the first time, be prepared to fall in love. That being said, there is petty crime so keep valuables hidden and be observant (if for nothing more than to avoid the motorcycles constantly revving past!). Enjoy yourself, but keep safe. Marrakech is a very safe country if you look after yourself."

At the square there are plenty on western style resturants where u can watch the bustle but not be a part of it, you will need this respite as u will be overwhelmed at some stage. If u want local fare by local people head to the market after 7.30pm..now in Marakesh, nothing is free many locals will c u with a map, approach u and offer to take u where u want to go or at least point u in the right direction, this will then be followed by do u have a gift for me, remember nothing is for free. We were given dodgey directions twice before we cottoned on. Having said that we never felt that we were not safe. When being asked to buy things and u will, be polite but firm if u r not interested. Snake charmers will demand payment if u try to take a picture so negotiate first 10 dirham or 1 euro is sufficient . You will also find monkey handlers same applies here to. Taxis r cheap but always negotiate price."

Everywhere you turn or look there is someone demanding money from you or a tourist. You'll have monkeys thrown at you, caps thrown in your face, people shooting at you from all directions. Do not venture into the Souks area unless you know where your going as everyone tries to send you the WRONG way and then you end up lost at their \"tannery\". Do not follow anyone. I had someone telling me the square was down one alleyway and yet I knew for a fact it was the other direction. They even scrubbed off the directions on the signs so tourists will get lost! The snake charmers do not charm snakes, they keep the snakes under a pot and they overheat until they are too sleepy to do anything when the pot is took off.The orange juice stalls are probably the only genuinely good thing on the square. I have very little good experiences of this place due to many many aggressive and greedy Moroccans who will eventually scare all western tourists away from marrakech. "

This colourful place has everything, both fascinating and irritating:- water sellers more interested in being paid to have their pictures taken than in selling water- snake charmers with their incessant and irritating flutes, more interested in extracting money from gullible tourists than in attending to their somewhat lethargic snakes- musicians who start banging their drums at 6 pm and stop somewhere around midnight, all the while thrusting caps into the faces of bystanders for money- acrobats, one hand on the ground, the other hand outstretched for cash- persistent and annoying waiters trying to steer people into evening food stalls.Most of all, Jemaa El Fna produces sensory overload!Taking pictures anywhere in the square carries with it the risk of being set upon by hordes of people all demanding money because you took 'their' picture.Never mind that there are thousands of people milling about in the square and getting a photo without people in it is impossible.Then, for me, it was the constant 'patience tester':Madam! Carriage ride?Madam! Henna?Madam! Photo?Madam! Phone card?Madam! Guide?Madam! Taxi?Madam! Sunglasses (even though I'm already wearing sunglasses)?My God, I couldn't even finish a thought!And if I went near one of the souk entrances bordering the square, OMG!!! It was the ever-present hard sell all the way: scarves, kaftans, slippers, carpets, perfume, Viagra for women, Argan oil - to rejuvenate me both inside and out; jewellery, furniture ... whatever it was, it was perfect for me and at a 'special' price. My complete lack of interest only served to spark a series of loud invectives from the vendors trying to peddle the stuff.Endless, endless attempts to extract money!Jemaa El Fna is definitely worth visiting if for no other reason than to see just how grasping, greedy and aggressive people can be!It's a place that really tests one's patience, so it's probably best to experience it in 'small doses'."

Another thing that you can't miss while you're here is the orange juice stalls, fresh juice for just 2 dirham which is the equivalent to about 30p! Watch out for people trying to trick you! Many of the street performers will make you take photos of/with them and then demand money, watch out for the men with the monkeys too they will literally throw their monkeys on you and ask you for money for pictures. If you're female get ready for the henna ladies to grab you and try and draw on you, you just have to learn to say no! Don't let any of this put you off though it's all part of the experience of Marrakech! Jamaa el Fna is such a wonderful place nothing like your boring local markets at home!"

The noise and sounds from the musicians, the smell from the food stalls, the crowds that start appearing, it really is worth seeing. Certainly an experience I would recommend, fascinating for people watching."

It is nice to sit at a cafe terraces and see the sunset over the square. Great for taking pictures too. Once night falls, be aware that the snake charmers are still at work so be careful where you walk! Also the snake charmers have eyes like hawks on tourist taking pictures of their snake. They will come up to you can hassle you for money. My advise is to either take the picture from afar or just look as you go pass. They can get quite aggressive, but if you mention tourist police they will often leave you alone. There are numerous food stalls which are all numbered. All serve pretty much the same things at the same price.They will in all efforts try to bring you to their stall as you walk past. If you get fed up with they asking you to go to their stall, you can say that you've already eaten, not hungry or that you might come back later. Surrounding the square are many souks, which is a bit of a maze, so just be aware of your directions."

Avoid the monkeys and their owners because they are also just trying to get your money. If it gets unbearably hot while you're in the square, I recommend getting some orange juice and sitting in the shaded park (on the opposite side of all the horses. You do not want to smell them while you relax.) If you're looking for a cheap meal, wait until dusk and all the food vendors started selling in the square. However, if you're not a fan of extremely crowded streets with pestering vendors, you may want to just stay home."

I'm not talking about actually watching and enjoying a performance, in which case you really should contribute, just actually glancing their way.....\"You pay now\" and \"I make trouble for you\" are the only English sentences that everyone seems to have memorized. Our party of 4 (two couples) tried to browse the various collections of dinner tents and we were LITERALLY torn apart from each other by the grasping hands of nearly a dozen different vendor employees. A woman from our group understandably freaked out, screamed and bolted for the outer square, and of course we followed, having to rip ourselves from the physical grip of seemingly desperate sales people. I do recommend that you just safely view the square from one of the several balcony restaurants around the square. If you do venture into the square, have a lot of small change to hand out or be prepared to aggressively defend yourself."

While walking towards the square we passed the mosque where thousands of people were praying before the fast broke. It was a beautiful sight to see.As prayers finished, the square was suddenly flooded with people looking to eat. We didn't eat at the food stalls since they were incredibly busy but there were so many to choose from if you wanted to partake. Men are showing you their menus and constantly inviting you to sit down at their picnic tables. We did visit the fresh orange juice stands - wonderful fresh squeezed oj for only 4 dh = .40 euros. And we purchased candied nuts and dried apricots from one of the beautifully laid out stands.The rest of the square was divided between entertainers - dancers, snake charmers, monkeys, henna artists, drummers, singers, etc and vendors selling clothes, shoes, lanterns, sunglasses - anything you could possibly want all placed out on bed sheets or crates on the ground. It was complete chaos and very entertaining. After circling around a few times, we went up to one of the restaurants with a roof top patio.

During the day, the activity level as well as crowds are low compared to the evening when the square comes to life. I would recommend going during the day and come back in the evening. There is a Bank Popular on the corner of the square that gives the best exchange rates. We were told not to eat in the pop up food stands due to the hygiene. There are many restaurants that have rooftops that would be much better. We did eat at a restaurant just off the square and see my review for more information. We did drink freshly squeezed orange juice for 5 dirhams. We wanted the juice in a plastic glass so it was 1 dirham more. This famous square taps into all five senses with snake charmers blowing their instruments, fortune tellers and women haggling for their services, musicians, smoke from the grills, and an unusual mix of people. I didn't really care to walk through the Jemaa in the evening because I felt the guys from the restaurant were rude when we didn't want to eat at their temporary stands. The items sold around the square were poorer quality so go farther into the souk. There are some stands for small tangines pots for 1 euro that make good souvenirs to bring home for friends.

It is very helpful to go with a guide as when the locals start to harass you with crazy prices for a picture or something he can tell them to leave you alone. By day there are snake charmers who will put a snake around your neck, moneys on chains people selling trinkets. At night is was wild. Fortune tellers, women doing henna. Way more locals than tourists. I liked it better at night."

Either standing by the \"halqas\" with their snake charmers, monkeys, musicians, magicians, story tellers.. fortune tellers.. and any other sort of different thing, or simply walking around enjoying your time overthere - you can also stop by and eat some of the traditional moroccan specialties at the square during the evening.It is one of the most lively (and exotic) places I've been and I highly reccomend it!"

The orange juice is refreshing, but look for the carts who serve ice-free juice with not sugar or additives. The snakes are lazy, loathsome, and probably abused. Get too close to the charmers with your camera, and they'll basically waive snakes at you until you pay them a tip for your photos. Beware the aggressive henna \"artists.\" Marrakech has anti-harrasment laws on the books, and shop-owners in the souks are pretty respectful of a firm 'no,' but the Jemaa el Fna is definitely a different story.At night, the snakes, orange juice et al. disappear. In their place, singers, dancers, storytellers, and slew of tent-restaurants. Watch for a good-looking grill, wedge yourself in between tourists from France and Australia, and tuck in to a plate of hot, sizzling meat. It may not be the soul of the city anymore, but it's definitely a circus worth experiencing. Bring small change for the entertainers, as the tip-hat is passed frequently."

The Souks which run off the Jemal El Fna are an amazing feast for the eyes with everything from leather to silver to kaftans and Moroccan pants on sale at very varying prices . By all means enjoy the haggling over prices but keep it fun and be prepared for several best and special prices. A word of advice venture into the Souks early in the morning first to get an idea how to navigate as at night it is very easy to get lost. Loved haggling but got a little bored with the sameness of what was on offer at the different stalls. Moroccan people generally very warm welcoming and friendly."

We went to the medina (old quarter) early to avoid the crowd. Do spend some time absorbing the hectic atmosphere of the square. There were lots of orange juice stalls, snake charmers, ladies offering henna hand tattoo and dancers in ethnic clothing. You may take a photo with them for a small fee.The square is very big with lots of locals and tourists. Be careful with your wallets and keep a close watch over your handbags in case of pick-pockets. Bring a bottle of water with you as the weather can get very hot. Otherwise, it's cheap to have a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice. In the evening about 5pm, we went to a roof-top restaurant over-looking the square for a meal and watch the square transformed in front of your eyes into dozens of food stalls selling grilled kebabs and other BBQ meats. If you are brave enough, try the sheep's head. Apparently, it's a delicacy in Morocco. There are many good restaurants surrounding the square. We were in Marrakesh for 8 days. Out of the 8 days, we had dinner at restaurants there 6 days in a roll. Try the lamb shish kebab, chicken or lamb tagine, hummus and finish your meal with a refreshing mint tea. The food we had were reasonably priced and delicious. The sight, smell and energy of the whole place was unbelievable. I will definitely go there again."

I didnt feel particularly 100% comfortable but then i thought oh what a nice locale just guiding a lost tourist. After around 10 min, we reached a point where he pointed out that it's just there by that end of the street. At this moment where he stopped, there were two men who clearly he knows of. We started to say our thanks and goodbye to the \"friendly\" guide, when his companion said to give him a little something. And then our \"friendly guide\" said 100 dirhams. I was incredulous and i repeated the amount he asked and then i said no, just 20. Then one of his companions started pointing his finger at me.

Offer to bargain with them, these little shops are not franchises so its interested offering a little less or saying you will buy the same thing down the street for half the price.

An assault on the senses and not always in a good way, but on the whole great fun in small doses.My tips :-- If you eat at one of the plethora of food stalls, be careful not to be railroaded into letting the waiters choose all your food for you without letting you see a menu. You will inevitably end up with double the amount of food and double the bill that you expected.- if you don't wants snakes and monkeys thrust upon you, then keep your wits about you as you stroll around the square.- After a hard day getting lost in the Souks, grab a drink on the balcony of one of the caf\u00e9s overlooking the Square, they start to set up stalls from late afternoon onwards. Once night falls, the square really does come alive. Don't bother dressing up, unless you've got a snake charmers outfit."

As often happens with this sort of place, it has become a victim of its own success.There would not be too many among us that haven't seen on TV or read in a brochure something exotic about this place.We initially went there in the early morning with some \"almost\" locals, because we had to witness this famous square for ourselves.It was ~10am and was, as we were to learn alter that day, comparatively quiet.Locals crossing the half empty square going about their business, classes of children sitting down paying attention to their teacher, the odd snake charmer, some fruit/juice carts, a few tourists .....There was little to distinguish it from the many other square, such as this, throughout the rest of Morocco, other than, perhaps, its size.We wandered off into the many souks that start, and or finish in the square.We spent many hours enjoying the hundreds of stalls, stopping every now and then for a drink.I don't know how many kilometers there are of these alleys but it feels like hundreds.By and large they are in sections.One part has clothes, another has foodstuffs, another leather goods ..... but there are no certainty or rules as to what is where.Getting lost?Almost everyone within the souk speaks a multitude of languages and are astute enough to see and help a lost tourist.They inevitably will point you back to the main square, and I witnessed, and experienced their help, several times during the day. As we were staying close by we went back to our hotel for a rest before returning for the \"main event\" i.e. the food stall of the night market.We came back at ~8pm and the square was indeed a maze of pop-up restaurants.We wandered about looking and listening to the touts (\"Fixed price menu for you madam/sir!\" which seemed to change depending on who they were pitching to.), the mesmerised tourists (as every restaurant is fairly similar to the next), the disgruntled tourists (of which we overheard an alarming amount - prices, quality of food, pushy /rude staff etc.) and, to be fair, quite a few people that were in awe of the whole thing.Personally, I have eaten, and know many others that have, far better for far less with better service at the hundred of places away from the square.This does not mean that you should go for a look of a night, especially with a \"pre-visit\" during the early day, but don't bother with meal as, unless you have exceptionally low standards, you will be disappointed. Go, but with low culinary and high cultural gap expectations ..... and most of all keep your wits about you and don't judge."

We arrived just after dusk and walked thought the throngs of entertainers, henna ladies, and a lot of fresh orange and grapefruit stalls. There is something for everyone and be sure to bargain for lowest prices. My colleagues insisted on dining at one of the many outdoor food stalls (veggies, meat sitting out at the ambient temp of 102 degrees - no refrigeration or chillers in sight) and while my stomach said yes to kebabs, etc.,, my common sense took over so I opted for only bread, olives and a coca cola. I'm having only minor stomach distress today. Be sure to bring anti- bacterial moist wipes and constantly keep your hands clean especially before eating.

Yes, you get some hassle to buy but it's part of the enjoyment.Then you go back to the square in the evening and what a place! It's so alive, with the snake charmers and the monkeys, the cross dressing belly dancers and the story tellers. Waiters in with mockney accents persuading you to try the cuisine at their barbecue, swearing that it's 'lovely jublee' and there is 'no diarrhoea here'! Yes, some of the entertainment is a bit forced and perhaps not totally authentic, you can't linger for too long without being asked for money, but it's an absolute must. This is an experience not to miss, an opportunity to be entertained, enthralled and dazzled. (I should add that the monkeys are not a pleasant sight, they made us very sad).There are lots of highlights and a few tips that would be useful but far better to go and learn for yourself! We didn't eat on the square, a few minutes away and you will find slightly less commercialised restaurants often with Moroccan musicians to entertain you whilst you eat.

A polite \"no thank you\" is usually enough, but you still need to be on your guard. Watch out for the henna tattoo ladies as they have a forceful grip and once inked, demand money. Besides that, make sure you visit at least once at night to see the food stalls come to life. If you are a photographer, try and find a nice cafe on the edge of the square with a rooftop view, you won't be disappointed!"

They have orange juice stands and dried fruit/nut stands. Along the streets leading to it you can spend hours looking through the shops. It's really an interesting place to visit.Be prepared for shop workers to approach you and ask how much you want to pay, show you their wares, etc. They are very forward about business and catching consumers here. It's easy to get lost, but that is part of the fun of it. As long as you know the general direction you came from, it should be easy enough to find your way back to the main square. If you do want to buy something, don't forget to haggle. They don't do it for food, but for most other things it should be common.Nothing ever happened to me, but keep an eye on your surroundings if you have a backpack with your wallet, passport, etc. in it.You will get get cat-called if you are a solo female traveler like myself. A pair of girls might receive the same treatment. It helps to have a male or group to walk around with because it deters younger males from saying things. It's only an annoyance and not an actual threat, but it does start to grate on you after a few days. It was worse when I went towards the evening around 7 than in the afternoons.Overall, it's an interesting place to be. You don't need to spend money here, just keep your eyes open and have curiosity as you wander through all the stalls."

I told her no, and tried to pull my hand away from her, but she would not let go. I had to yell at her and push her away. Another guy came up to my husband, draped a snake around his neck and asked if we wanted a picture. He then of course held his hand out for money. Had we wanted these things, that would have been great. But we didn't, and so we were really irritated with their forcefulness. Not everybody was as aggressive as those two, but the rest certainly aren't shy about asking. So just be prepared to say \"no\" a lot!

Go on the evening if you can, when all the restaurants suddenly appear and the place is heaving - the atmosphere is so much better. The souks are connected to the square so do them both together, and the impressive moqsque can be seen from just about everywhere and acts as a landmark when you want to get back to where you started. Wherever you are staying, there are a number of bus routes taking you to the square for next to nothing.

We found it exhausting trying to enjoy it as everywhere you turned people were aggressively demanding money. We felt quite shell shocked and angry after spending a few days in Marrakech, we had hoped for a relaxing break, but I felt like a body guard for my wife most of the time. At one point , while visiting an attraction someone approached us and said it was closed, and we should follow him to another attraction, we realised quite quickly he was lying, and had to run away, being pursued and physically and verbally abused ! Most of the shop keeps we encountered were equally hostile, not allowing us to just enjoy browsing in their shops, they would follow us and constantly make us buy things and look at things that we were not interested in. This made us less likely to enter shops, despite having a long list of things we wanted to buy for friends, we ended up buying very little. Even the taxi driver our hotel had pre-paid to take us to the hotel from the airport tried ripping us off, and the toilet attendant was demanding tips at the airport (been though he wasn't the attendant, And the real attendant was being paid to do their job !). . ..so, literally at every stage in your Marrakech experience people will try to aggressively take money from you, I was threatened with a knife by some teenagers inane alleyway, and forced to give them money and the beer I was carrying, the next day we witnessed a machete attack, in which a boys leg was nearly cut off, and locals didn't even seem to care. . . . the following day a man whom refused to leave us alone when we refused his offer of showing us directions followed us into a restaurant and tried to intimidate us while we were eating. honestly, its not even safe to take photographs without being asked for money, you have been warned....stay away. Its not worth the effort, you have been warned !"

Its a total sensory overload - acrobats, musicians, food stalls, market sellers, horse and carriages drivers dashing about, missing each other by inches. Sad to see the snake charmers and monkeys on leads being put back in tiny boxes (cruel) but I would still recommend you see it all for yourself and make your own judgement, it certainly isnt boring, that's for sure! People approach you all the time, mostly with good intentions but its probably not wise to take large 'obvious' handbags and cameras. We took a small purse with just the cash we needed for that day and were fine. The first time we went we were a bit 'rabbit in the headlights' but when we returned a second time to go back to the Souks (which are at the back of the square) we felt more relaxed and happy to enjoy the madness! Most of the resturants on the square are average and quite expensive. Go a street or two out and find a more authentic eatery - try the Pigeon Pastille (surprisingly good)"

We did not try the food stalls but they looked very tempting. Shopping in the souk was a bit hectic as everyone is out calling you and sometimes it does get on your nerves. The price sometimes was 4 times as someone else would quote. So visit a few shops. It is a bit more commercialized and personally I think I liked the Fes souks and medina a little better. No one bothered you in Fes and it is a working medina. If some one takes you somewhere in Marrakech, expect to pay money. 10 Dirhams was not enough; it was almost ridiculous as they would demand 50 dirhams for a few minutes work. Fez has much better leather goods. The fossil place in Erfoud has wonderful gifts at reasonable prices also."

This is when the food stalls are up and running, a variety of street entertainers ply for your coins, including snake charmers, street fighters, quacks, water carriers and all kinds of vendors, dodgy or otherwise. We enjoyed the horse and carriage ride, which takes you away from the square, through the Nouveau Ville, and past several prominent buildings, mosques and public places, including the tile frontage on the Gare de Marrakech. The other way to enjoy the sights is to pay a small amount for a soft drink and relax on one of the roof terraces that surround the square, with its amazing activities on show below.

Don't take photos unless you're prepared to pay for the privilege. There are many rooftop terraces around Jemaa el Fna, perfect for people-watching without being hassled. Stick around late afternoon/evening to watch the square come to life as the street food vendors start setting up and selling their (delicious) food. If eating the food (recommended!) be sure to eat with your fingers as the cutlery isn't properly washed between diners. Kebabs make great finger food, and taste delicious! Enjoy the banter of the street vendors as they try to draw you in - they're fun, friendly and usually get the message if you politely decline."

She said no, and the person grabbed her hand and started drawing on it anyway! The restaurants (and we went to about half a dozen of them) are poor, both in terms of the food (accompanied by bland bread) and the interior (they were really unclean). Most people do not leave you alone even when you say you don't want their services. We have been to many parts of the world and this has been the worst hassle we have encountered. You cannot even eat your food without being hassled to buy watches etc every 2 minutes. The same is for the souks nearby. Watch out for many scam artists, who will try and tell you to go somewhere like the leather market 'nearby', and then direct you down lots of passages until you get lost. We didn't fall for this, and we suspect they do it so you can then pay them a fee to help you find your way back again. We also encountered people telling us the attraction we sought was closed when this was incorrect. The main thing is do not trust anyone there. Our advice: if you want the bazaar experience, go to Istanbul. There is more variety, better quality and less hassle while shopping."

By day it is bustling with a big open square, by night the pop up restaurants come out, as do so many more visitors. I can't say why but there seemed to be at least double the number of people there at night. Make sure you keep aware of your belongings but we felt very safe there. Be careful taking photos of locals, you may well find yourself surrounded by a group demanding payment which can be intimidating. This is especially so of the snake charmers and other groups that frequent the square. Also be careful when negotiating prices that you both understand the agreed price. This is especially so with the horse carriages and taxis. Even then you still may not get the full value or trip you thought you negotiated but prices are cheap by European standards so it should be good."

The food stands all have seating areas and a wonderful display of the different foods they cook...including sheep's heads and tongues! Lots of kebab type things, fish, soup spicy sausages etc. so a good choice if you dare to try. There are many westerners eating there and you can see generally the food is well cooked. The sellers try hard to persuade you to eat at their stand, don't look and just walk on if you are not interested (also do that if someone comes up wanting you to buy anything, they usually give up quickly).

The snakes generally would be content to stay curled up and sleep. But a little bit of teasing would bring them up out of their coil. I did get lost in the souk and back streets but that was fun. It is a photographers paradise. I did purchase a couple of frame drums (a tar and a bendir) but the quality is not that good. I also bought a couple of djellabas (long hooded robes) for my wife and daughter and likely paid a bit too much. I looked at carpets at the Cri\u00e9e Berb\u00e8re but they were mostly tourist quality carpets (e.g. machine spun wool with synthetic dyes).

The real show starts at 6:30pm or so with moroccan bands, boxing matches, snake charmers, ladies doing henna, the food stalls which are safe to eat at, snail and orange juice vendors, and people with monkeys! Food stall #1 advertises as the best but stick to where the locals eat, try not to chow down next to the person who flew next to you. Obviously you're going to Marrakech for an adventure try something new!"

My advice is to go before the sunset, to one of the cafeterias (I recommend Grand Balcon), to enjoy the mint tea and to watch sunset. As late you will be in this amazing square, more local people will come and enjoy night life. Everywhere you can buy fresh orange juice (glass with 10 MAD = cca 1 euro), as well we were eating on the square fresh grilled meat, it was fantastic and you enjoy much more the atmosphere. So my recommendation is to go afternoon, when is not so much hot, cca 17:00, to go for shopping to the souk and for sunset to watch from upper terrace the square and after that to go to eat down and to enjoy!"

As soon as we do they ALWAYS come running after us to seal the deal! Use it and abuse it. Its a powerful too. NEVER pay more than half of the asking price. If you do, you've been taken for a fool! You can find all kind of goodies. Their leather products are of really good quality and its mostly hand stitched. We stayed in Marrakesh for 5 days. We always ate in restaurants but on the last day we decided to have a kebab on the market square. Thank goodness I had it on the last day because I got food poisoning! I was ill for 3 days, lost 6kg and was very poorly. DON'T eat on the square. Its a real gamble. Or do if you need to loose a bit of weight. Thanks for reading my review and happy haggling!"

Yes there are lot of pushy beggars and dodgy characters but that doesn't remove from the attraction and entertainment of the square. There are also some excellent cafes present both day and night especially the one serving ice-cream and crepes just by the atms. There are many bureau de change and cash machines nearby in case you expend all your money on buying gifts for family and friends. Freshly squeezed orange juice is available for just 4 dirhams and the best food on the street is brought out once the sun goes down. My advice would be to visit earlier in the day, have some fun and go on the horse drawn carriages then visit later at night from about 10pm until 2am. There are snake charmers, story tellers etc but beware of the henna as they try to cheat you and the black henna leads to an allergic reaction as experience by at least two people from our group. If you are eating at night, stall 114 is one of the best for food."

No.32 had been the place to go for us but one night, we wanted to try somewhere different, quickly checked the review on google and although No.31 was not as hightly reviewed as the other stands we've tried, it had a okay review so we decided to give it a go and soon found it was a big mistake. We knew most places charge for the bread served as you sit down at the table which didn't bother me much. It came with some other condiment-looking stuff such as mushed spinach(I assume that was, still not sure), olives and whatever we didn't know whats called, which we didn't order so thought they'd be free like anywhere else we've been to did.Just before our plates were served, I saw some cockroaches crowing in the booth, gave me a chill going down my spine. We had a mixed grill(70DH) to share and my husband ordered 1 coke(10DH), the bread was 10 DH each(I noticed its double the price compared to others)So we were expecting the bill to be 100DH but it came out as 135DH in total!!!!!!!!!!!! They charged us for the condiment we didn't even order, we tried to explain the situation but they didn't seem to get it. One guy who understood English a little bit better than the other staff came out so my husband asked if that was a trick and he said yes. My jaw dropped! We didn't touch the olives so after the argument, they eventually took it off the bill but still we had to pay 125DH. It's just a few quid more so couldn't be that big deal but we were definitely not happy at all that the staff turned out to be so rude to us and even swore at us as we left.We so much wished we were sticking to No.32 or just went to Cafe Arab(service is great and they will give you goodquality, free condiments there) now..."

It's a great place to soak up the atmosphere and I'd recommend visiting in the early evening as there is a real buzz as the sun goes down. As a seasoned traveller I wasn't surprised by the people on the square trying to con us, but my friend was taken in by a henna tattoo 'present' which she was then charged 400 dh for (around \u00a328!), she paid 200 but tourists should know not to pay more than 25dh for something like that (around \u00a32). A lot of people will offer things for free only for you to find out they're not free. If they do then you can walk away or tell them you will call the police. They leave you alone fairly quickly when they realise you won't pay. Snake charmers will only want paper money of around 400dh. I paid 50dh for two of us after much haggling, which is still a reasonable amount of money. It's an amazing place and people shouldn't be put off by what they've read about being conned. Just be aware. Also almost everyone I spoke to who ate off the square got sick, so it's probably worth a look but not worth the risk! Go and enjoy and once the sun has gone down, visit one of the cafes overlooking the square to hear the sounds and drink some mint tea."

We travelled around Morocco recently ( I just arrived home today ) and from all the places we've been, Marrakech - and particularly Jemaa el Fna - was the worst experience we had. It's a scam paradise, you can't walk 10 steps without someone trying to get money from you. And yes, they're persistent. The animal cruelty there is also horrible. Monkeys, snakes, horses, donkeys, lizards, all animals in great distress. Don't forget that, we as tourists, are the ones that feed this cruel business, so avoid taking pictures with these animals or giving money to their owners. Morocco is one of the most beautiful countries where I've been so far but Marrakech was simply annoying. We skipped Fes because we knew it was going to be similar. If you like nature and to connect with real people that can teach you their culture and share experiences, head to the mountains of toubkal, explore the desert in Hassilabied, get lost in the road to Imilchil or check the monkey forests near Azrou. The real Morocco is seen in the countryside, if you really want to see the true country, get out of big cities and get off the beaten path."

Temporarily built tents as \"wannabe restaurants\" with extremely good food and great value for money, combined with even more local artists and performers with tribal music in the background... and the crowd is 100 times larger than during the day... quite a hassle, but hey, if you can't handle it, then don't come in Marrakech at all..."

We ended up returning almost daily for either lunch or dinner because the buzz of the square was just irresistible. Be prepared for anything and everything - and be careful not to show too much interest in or photograph anything you have no desire to pay for. Performers like snake charmers and belly dancers are incredible to watch and set a magical atmosphere - but if you're caught taking a photograph they will ask you to pay, and may encourage you to take one so they can ask for money afterwards. Young females beware - either be prepared to cover up modestly, or travel with an elder or a male. The square was incredible but one evening we braved some sundresses rather than maxi's and had some fairly explicit advances which made us really uncomfortable."

At first I want to say that because of all the reviews on TripAdvisor I could not help being very tense when walking through Jemaa-el Fna for the first time. I have to tell you, it is not that big of deal. Yes, people will approach you with snakes and monkeys and more than once per minute you will hear \"excuse me\" or 'Hello\". Yes, it can be hard when they try to persuade you, but just stay with your statement. No means no! \"La Chokran\", no thank you in Arabic, is also very effective . Do not communicate with the henna ladies, snakecharmers and water vendors (dressed-up beggars) unless you want to pay.

We walked passed a snake charmer and they insisted we went over. Knowing we would be asked for money (which we had none left as we were on way to get some) we tried to refuse but eventually were taken over. Whilst there a lady came and took hold of my arm. I tried to get her off me but she began drawing up my arm ( henna) I insisted I did not want a henna as I am quite allergic and that I had no money. She said my normal price is 600 dirham, but you choose your price. I said I don't want it and tried to get her off me. She got quite angry and said she would walk me to the bank to get 600 dirham. Quite scared we walked to the bank and got money. We handed her 100 and jumped in a cab home, cutting short out visit to the square. It's a real shame that such a lovely exciting place and such an experience can be ruined so easily.

There are various temporary stalls within the square, selling fresh orange juice (delicious), pottery, knick knacks etc. also dotted around are the ubiquitous snake charmers - bit of a shock to the system if you don't like reptiles. There are other performers that turn up, do their thing and then move on so it is ever changing.However it's in the eveningwhen the square really comes alive. It is jammed packed at night with temporary food sellers - the pre-runner of the very fashionable pop-up restaurant in the UK. They do seem to congregate by type so for instance all the (what appeared to be) clam stalls were in one area with kebab stalls in another. They all have sheltered seating areas outside for customers to sit and enjoy their food. It's a really colourful place and much larger than I imagined it would be. Apart from the snakes (!) it is not scary or threatening just very entertaining. Well worth a visit."

All sorts of products, entertainment and services are available and you can experience \"marketing\" in it's purest form. After sunset a lot of mini \"restaurants\" appear with kebabs and other fare. We enjoyed the food, but it's basic street food so don't expect fine dining.Do beware the aggressive buskers and shop owners on this square. This is the only place I've visited where people grab arms and blocked you from moving in an attempt to make you listen to them or buy something. In one instance my 12 year old son was held by the arm by a man with a macaque, and he had to free himself by violently wrenching his arm out of the persons grasp. This left some red marks on his arm and a small scratch. In another instance I was blocked from moving for about 10 seconds by two gentlemen who where trying to get me to visit their clothing stall. After determining that I wasn't being mugged, I said \"No\" loudly several times and they eventually moved away. Neither incident was particularly troubling to us, but I think these kinds of tactics might bother a lot of people. Both incidents happened during the early afternoon in plan view of the square."

Of a night it became filled with performers and food stalls, snakes, monkeys, the dentist with his pliers and teeth, a carnival atmosphere. Be aware if you watch or take photos of performers you will be expected to pay, personally the monkeys on chains and dressed in clothes did little for me, whilst I enjoyed the drummers and musicians, take coins with you.

Jemaa el Fna is grand, it is unique, it is an unprecedented phenomenon, the magical place, it is the soul and the rythm of Marocco and maybe even of the whole North Africa. You may see much better markets and bazaars in Istanbul, much more sophicticated and amazing islamic architecture can be discovered in Andalucia, but only in Marrakech you will find the mesmerizing and enchanting Jemaa el Fna. Make sure your hotel is located nearby this is worth the money spent."

The menus are fairly similar, but take your time to look at what each place has to offer. Look for places that have plastic utensils if concerned about cleanliness. For the more adventurous eater there are booths that sell sheep head and some smaller stalls only selling snails."

Shame.The best thing to do is go to one of the roof top restaurants, have a relaxing drink and perhaps food there and take photos from there.At night the place transforms into an open restaurant. Walk between the food stalls at your peril, the people trying to get you to eat at their place are really pushy - unlike the Souk areas.So must not be missed, but whether you enjoy it or not, that is another matter!"

People everywhere, dancers, noisy music makers, singers, storytellers, snake charmers \u2026. One expects Ali Baba to turn up anytime.But also loads of people trying to sell you stuff. Very hard to get them off your back.And stalls everywhere, selling you freshly pressed orange juice, dried fruits etc.A part of the square is for open restaurants, all selling you the same food for exactly the same prices and men in front of their stalls trying to make you eat in their stall. 'Oh mister you look like ... come and eat with us, we sell you the best, the freshest' etc, etc. We tried to have a look to see what the others had on offer, off course, but it became impossible for me to coap with this constant bombardment. So my advice, don't go through it too long, get a bench where locals eat, and you will see, it all stops and becomes somewhat quieter.Food was ok, don't expect too much, enjoy the athmosphere.And I agree with other recencents, the architecture hasn't much to offer, it is more for the athmosphere. But without a visit, I believe you missed the very heart of Marrakech, so it is a must see.What you also can do is go up to one of the high terraces, have a drink or a bite to eat there and watch what's going on. Do that before all the marketeers arrive and watch how the whole square changes."

After speaking to police they apologised & told us that although they do have plain dressed officers mixing with the crowd these things unfortunately do happen. I would say dont let it put you off but do be aware of whats going on around you & behind you especially when watching the entertainers.

Do watch out at night when walking through the food and drink stalls however. As they approach you quite a bit, and assume you are walking through for food, not to just see what is happening. So please be aware of this. Another issue we had, was when buying orange juice from one of the sellers, the one next to him took a dislike to us for not purchasing from him. He then repeatedly yelled at us and gave us the finger. We were not taking pictures, or talking with him prior to this happening and it was entirely unprovoked. Beyond these issues, the square is a wonderful place to wonder around and experience the Marrakech eve with tourists and locals alike."

Lots of energy and things to witness.It is best to visit in both the early afternoon and at night. The square transforms into an even more energetic atmosphere at night with street vendors haggling everyone that their restaurant is the best and has the best prices although they are all roughly the same.Words of advice:The snake charmers and the henna women are quite aggressive. The henna women came up to me after I was admiring someone else's henna and even though I said I did not want it and that I had no money she continued to draw and kept saying \"bon prix\"... eventually I shook my arm free and she wanted 350dh (around 35Euros) for the design which I refused to pay and I ended up giving her a 50dh bill (around 5euros) as I had nothing else on me. I later learned that I could have tried to negotiate for even 20dh but oh well."

They all have roof terraces which are slightly more peaceful than the ground floor, but still full of atmosphere. We had teas and coffees there, as well as some lunches. All were reasonably priced and good value.

At night, most of the orange juice stalls are gone and instead there will be lots of food stalls selling kebabs to some unknown local dishes. First night we made a mistake by going to a kebab place (we can't remember the number) and it was horrible. It's hard to pick a place because everything looks pretty much the same and everyone from each stall will try to grab your arms and get you to eat there. Some of them were VERY rude. Second night we set our sight on one place with only the locals sitting and eating with their hands. Stall number 98. Go there. Deep fried fish and calamari were so delicious but their mashed eggplant was honestly one of the best dishes I had in Morocco. It was magical. This place was really cheap and we came back the next day for some more."

I wouldn't advise eating at any of the stalls, they all sell the same stuff and it's not up to much, best going to a local cafe over-looking the square...Cafe de France and the Le Grand Balcon Cafe Glacier are two that offer superb views and if you aren't wanting to eat just buy a drink to go up there...mint tea 30 Dirhams, cheap enough to get the photos and experience the action from a different angle.Every one is very friendly, at no point did we feel threatened... well other than getting our bums groped whilst standing in a very tight crowd -hey ho!"

We ate here twice during our stay-the first time we chose a stall with lots of locals and they gave us a selection of food which was all really tasty. The second time we got sucked in by pushy traders and although we enjoyed the food, it was full of tourists and the service wasn't as good. I'd recommend choosing a food stall as quickly as possible (preferably with lots of locals eating there) and not faffing about, because the more you faff the more you get hassled!"

I personally do not find monkeys on chains, snakes in baskets or stall after stall forcing their objects on me enjoyable in any way.

At 4pm the whole square starts to change as carts appear from all directions bringing in mobile restaurants which are set up by an army of men climbing all over the growing structures like ants, pulling on plastic roofs and starting charcoal fires to cook on. Within the hour the square is transformed into an enormous complex of mini eateries, all of which employ several men to entice passers by to chose to eat at their place rather than any other. It can be quite fun to walk past all of the stands and listen to the often quite witty heckles from the guys desperately trying to get you to chose to eat at their restaurant. Do not be surprised if, when you do finally decide where to sit, you get a huge round of applause.For the best experience of the square, take a stroll for an hour around at around 2pm, then head up to one of the rooftop cafes to have a coffee and watch the carts descend on the square at 4pm. Once the stalls are set up go for another walk past as many food stalls as you can before sitting down for a tasty Moroccan feast. (Take a bow if they clap and cheer)"

This place has everything snake charmers, monkey handlers, juice stands, and shops during the day. At night it turns into dancers, drum circles and food stalls at night. Most of the entertainers/vendors are hustlers so be careful. As others have said, if you approach one of the groups (snake charmers, etc.) be prepared to pay for a picture. Large circles often form around these entertainers so I also kept an eye out for pick-pockets.This place has such great energy at night and is really a must-see."

I was in Marrakech as a single woman travelling alone and spent an evening wandering around the square - it is incredible - the whole world seems to be there and the entertainment is second to none - got hustled into having a meal which wasn't terribly good but everyone is so friendly and sweet that I was not overly worried - I am not sure why all these nervous women get so uptight as I chatted away to lots of people and did not feel in the slightest bit unsafe. As I have said in my other review about the souk - these things are about your attitude and being from Glasgow I have had more than sufficient experience of cheeky boys to cope easily here. The photography issue is easily solved by buying yourself a tea in one of the balcony restaurants and shooting your pictures from there. The horse drawn carriage ride I eventually took around the square and city was excellent value for money and the horses were in magnificent shape. Carriage number 31 - highly recommended."

All sellers and attractions have their reserved places. You come back another day and will still find your peanut seller or snake tamer right were they were before. Just before sunset, you'll see all these carts hurry to their assigned spots on the square. Stands are being assembled in no time and people start cooking and offering their food. A lot of locals eat here. We were going to also, but since we were so unlucky with the weather we decided we'd be much warmer in a restaurant. We'll just have to come back ;-)In order to get a good view of the hustling and bustling, you should go up to one of the cafe's. We went to the Cafe' Glacier. Great view! Go when the food vendors start setting up shop. It's amazing!"

Take your camera! We then headed down to find something to eat. Everyone wanted us to join their stall and choosing was hard (and a bit fraught) but we found somewhere and the food was lovely. Only one word of caution, we only ordered a main course but were brought 3-4 starters each and charged for them (although they didn't cost that much). Not sure how we could have avoided that.

The central square (and medina as a whole for that matter) is like taking a step back hundreds of years in time. The food stalls are unique (but can be unsanitary). Follow the locals and look through the tripadvisors for the safe reviews of each stall. We went with the TripAdvisor recommendations and never had a problem. You will be hounded by locals trying to sell there wares. Just be firm and keep walking. Remember nothing is free......locals will come to you with snakes, monkeys etc for pictures. Rest assured they want paid. Have a prepaid tip ready if you want a picture or they will have you erase the free pics. All in all, it is a really cool experience if you can handle the high pressure sales. If you have a keen eye you will be able to buy some really unique gifts that weren't made in China (keep a close look at what you are buying because a lot of it IS still made in China). If you are buying any name brand items, remember, almost all are fakes (and you get what you pay for). At night the place turns into a party. Really cool atmosphere that is a must see. Marakech is probably one of the most unique and interesting vacations I have ever been and I do not regret it!"

In the daytime you have snake charmers and men with monkeys etc. My tip for them is to put what you're willing to pay in coins into your pocket before you take any photos etc. You also have fruit stalls and orange squashers which are reasonably priced by western standards. You also have plenty of stalls selling bits and bobs etc. At night the square comes to life and you have a variety of pop-up restaurants to choose from. I personally found the stalls on the sides of the square quieter and nicer to eat at. I had a bad experience with the pop up restaurants and found them to be very rude and they all claim \"no diarrhea 2 years\" as if thats supposed to reassure me...You also have a variety of entertainers and musicians as well as a regular pop stool where you have to hook the bottle (near impossible to win, but it's a bit of fun). You also have horse drawn carriages on the edge of the square, I can't comment on whether these were any good. Overall the Jemaa el Fna has a wonderful atmosphere and I'd recommend it, but as with anywhere don't feel pressurised into buying anything you don't want and be safe as there are some undesirable people about."

Remember to haggle with the locals they often over price things as they expect you to haggle. It's great during the day for grabbing some bargains and it comes alive at night. You do get harassed by the locals however I found Egypt much worse. There is so much to offer, I would highly recommend the fresh orange juice and the amazing entertainment. Definitely worth a visit."

The busy square is where all the flotsam and jetsam of Marrakech ends up, it is good for a walkthrough on the way to somewhere else. It is where all the poor and desperate come to pray on tourists for their money. Most of it is quite harmless but there are a few 'entertainers' that if you had a camera with you, even if the lens cap was on they would accuse you of taking a picture, and demand money. Or they would put their hat on you as you walked by, and demand a picture, to then demand money. It is best to take it all with a grain of salt and enjoy it for what it is, a busy tourist trap, designed to distract you and get your money! The orange juice stands are worth trying and there is a restaurant called Yamy (sp) just across from Cafe de France which has a really good breakfast (the 30 dhm one)... Best Msemen I had while in Marrakech"

At the time of year we were there it's perhaps quieter than high season but still busy with the friendly orange sellers 30p, 30 cents EU or 40 cents US for a cup. It's good to see that the dancing bears have gone and the dancing monkeys and snake charmers are also on the way out. their passing shouldn't be mourned as the animals suffered terrible cruelty. Most tourists ignore the few charmers and trainers that remain, killing their trade. Food is passable in the balcony cafes around the square but for the best dining experience you really must sit in the communal dining pitches that pop up in the square in the evening. the balcony terraces are great for having a cola or a tea and watching the world go by though. The most iconic Caf\u00e9 Argana is still being refitted after the terrible events of 2011 but should open later this spring. if you really need a beer it's not that hard to find and there is a great bar just round the corner from the Caf\u00e9 de France above La Salama restaurant."

You have lots of attractions there - you can see cobras, plenty of people, small restaurants (not sure about the hygien) etc... But there are lots of people who profit as you are tourist. The is the biggest negative problem in Marrakech. You take a picture and immediately behind you there is the person asking you plenty of money. As my, a photo with cobra and then asking me 40 euros!!! and if trying to negociate,sometimes that person tries to increase the voice to make you fear ... And also another experience, I was walking down the square and there was a guy with the monkey, I refused he put the monkey on my shoulder but he did... Well, that time I decided to take a photo and made an agreement that I will give 1 euro to the guy... But while taking the picture, the moment I couldnt move as I had a fear the monkey will fall down, there was another guy who put the second monkey on my second shoulder. The monkey was peeing on my Tshirt, I was disgusted, angry and the guy asked me for 10 euros and I already gave him 1 euro as the agreement. He began to touch me and increase the voice as he tried to make me feel as a thief... The only thing that helps you is to use the word POLICE, as there is always the police on that square. Make understand these people that if they continue to be bad, you go directly speak to the police."

Maybe there was a time (before EasyJet), when snake charmers, and monkeys dressed as ballerinas was exotic. Now, it feels like vintage tourist trap.Nevertheless, as I said on the title: it is unmissable. If you are around the Atlas Asni hotel, it is a good walk (about 20 minutes), or a 30 dirham taxi ride.

If you attempted to photograph them even from a distance one or their spotters would approach you & demand money from you, if you did not pay as I didn't an altercation would take place.They were not nice people so it was best to just walk away & ignore their demands which is what I did.

The magic of this place is not the architecture, or beautiful buildings or some tourist-oriented feature, so do not expect that or you could be a bit disappointed, as other reviewers were.The beautiful part here is that you get to see the real people of Marrakesh, it's them enjoying the place. Very specially at sunset (great photo opportunity from the Cafe Francais in one of the sides of the square!), and late at night.People here are proud to use their traditional clothing and it can be quite striking until you get used to it, specially in winter when the djellabas (long robes with a huge hood) are out - you really feel like travelling back in time. And then the families coming to the square for a quick snack, or some real food (there are great food stalls) or a coffee, or for a walk between the marrakeshi music, or go through the square on their way towards the medina alleys and tiny stalls. Thousands and thousands of people, mostly locals. The smells of the myriad stalls, spices, exotic fruits, strange things like cigarette sellers that sell cigarettes by the unit, or a man with a bathroom scale checking your weight for just one diram. Life is lived and enjoyed in a different way over here and this is what you get to see in this mythic square."

Best value and interesting foods were the soups (about 3 dh), lamb head (if you're into that stuff - delicious and different - 15 dh for 1/4 pound), snails, and this ginger drink. Basically follow crowds that look local. Skip the restaurants around the square. Skip traditional meals like tangines and couscous - esp if Marrakesh is your first city - you will be sick of chicken tangine soon enough and if you do any desert tours all the included dinners are tangines. Food here is fairly representative of good street food if you choose the right things, though if you want even more local and even cheaper, find the stands hidden throughout the souks."

My partner fancied a small bracelet type of henna tattoo on her wrist and got quoted 250 dhirams which was about \u20ac22. It was an entrepreneurial opening offer. Don't scream and shout. Come back with a better offer. We finally said we would agree on 50 dhirams and that was more than we would pay in the UK. This was accepted. You must try an orange juice, they are beautiful. All charge the same, just 4 dhirams. For some reason I kept going back to a very cheerful sole on stall number 28. And finally you must try the food from early evening.

I wanted to buy a Jallab and as soon as they knew that am a tourist the price was doubled .. Found out the original price from another shop and I ended up buying the Jallab for 50% less !

They tend to be in a hurry all the time and say things (like adding salad etc) to your order and you just say yes to everything. So take note and be clear when you order. Like if you're ordering salad - don't just say \"salad\" say ONE salad. Otherwise they bring salad for each person. The food seems cheap but once you add it all up it seems a bit pricey. It's worth a try though. There are people selling desserts as well. These look amazing and it's only 30dh and you get to choose 15 different mini desserts and pastries. We didn't like any of them. Most of them were tasteless and not very fresh. Again.... something good to try but don't have high expectations. The nuts were all amazing, as well as the Turkish apricots. Juices were fresh and the harira soup is good. I didn't try the snail soup.It's a cool place to hang out at night because there's a great vibe.

Sure some vendors were a bit persistent offering their wares, but never too pushy. The square is super busy day & night. I love the fortuneteller, the healer, & the many random games. Unlike what some say, the square is also full of locals (not just tourists). Be there right when they're setting up the stalls for dinner. The seafood in Morocco are very bland, so avoid. The lamb sausage was delicious, though. Make sure you ask the prices for each thing put on your table because at the end of the meal you can sometimes be surprised by the extras. Be discreet when taking pictures, most vendors (& some people) only relent being photographed if you pay them money/buy something from them."

Moroccan culture is so different and traffic is madness. Anyway, the traders were always trying to get some money out of us and of course trying to overcharge for goods. It was also low season so that explains their prices. So barter, they will drop prices slowly (have 50% of the asking price in your head at least). I didn't think much of the quality of the goods in the markets though. However, we purchased few handmade rugs after major bartering fight. We won after we threatened to leave shop !The worst thing was some of the snake charmers. One of them walked up behind me and placed it over my shoulder without warning ! Gave me a real shock. I told him to remove it immediately. He did so but started cursing me. I noticed a lot of bad attitude generally during our trip.Morocco is definitely worth a visit to see the mountains, the historical places and major towns and walled cities such as Fez and Casablanca. We took a very nice first class return train journey from Marrakech via Casablanca to Fez and back. Just beware of beggars, tricksters, hyped prices, snakes and taxis of course ! Remember you can't take any Moroccan currency out of the country, so make sure you spend it !P.S. The Tagines are absolutely lovely - do try those ! Their available all over !"

If you're going to take a picture of any of the street entertainment, be prepared to pay the entertainer, whether it be snake charmers, monkey handlers, or musicians.

You really need have your wits about you in this place that certainly keeps you on your toes as you dodge the bullets of the insistent vendors, beggars and dodgy looking characters.I suppose I am a bit weird but I do revel in being in an environment of the weird and unknown. This place is a huge culture shock and is certainly a different world to the new Marrakech that is so aptly divided by the surrounding red wall!Yes, there are many conniving and dishonest characters trying to get you to depart with your dirham and any other approved currency but you soon wisen up to their approach and can shrug them off without too much fuss.I was saddened to read other people experiencing aggression and hostility from the vendors and street entertainers as this is something we did not experience at all. When we said no that was the end of the matter, the most we experienced was disparate pleading to buy something or have hennah painted.Take a stroll and observe the chaos and characters that are everywhere. There are lots of restaurants dotted around the square where you can sit back with a nice cup of mint tea and watch the action. The food can be decent too depending on where you go and we paid what we asked for, it seems the rip-offs take place at he food stalls where the vendors try to entice you eat there as you're clearly 'starving Marvin' and they have a no diarrhoea guarantee! Pretty funny to listen to their limited patter of English slang but I would be careful if dining at these stalls. There's a raw vibe about the place, the young lads have a rough and ready demeanour about them But they were never intimidating or rude.Witness the local woman sitting and having a good natter, the men also doing the same and the young lads being boisterous and rowdy. This is a great place for people watching!This is not a place for the British stiff upper lip, there's no room for it here!There are some decent things to purchase but the bulk of it is tacky souvenir tat. The lanterns for candles are pretty when lit up at night but they are not made from sturdy metal so the quality is lacking and they are worth about \u00a33 each at most.The decorative souvenir tajins should be properly inspected as many contain chips in them so make sure you look at them properly before you purchase.I did not like the fake beggars, they are not genuine it's just an act to get easy money, you will find this out when you offer food instead of cash which is refused. I am happy to give food / buy food for someone who is homeless but I won't give cash and it's even worse when you get the kids begging as they have been set up by an adult to do their dirty work in using the kids to collect cash. This is unacceptable.I also do not condone the exploitation of the monkey's and cobras to 'entertain' the tourists. This form of so called entertainment needs to be stumped out. This equally applies to the horse and carts where the horses are in such poor condition. If people stopped paying for such things then it's one step towards these acts being eradicated. Me and my husband were never once harassed to have pictures taken with the monkeys and cobras and this is such a bad thing to do given many people have fears of snakes in particular. I was particularly amused by young lads pushing buggies with stereos being powered with car batteries blasting out Moroccan music, they really added to the atmosphere. The souks have lovely leather bags and I enjoyed wandering around and around just soaking in the atmosphere and looking at the stuff for sale which to be honest is all pretty relative around the souks. The scarves are really pretty too and come in array of designs and colours. As previous pekoe have mentioned, haggle, haggle, haggle!Some parts of the souks are really smelly and quite disgusting but you soon move away from these smelly parts to move to an area that smells of all the spices displayed outside.

Jemaa el fna is full of hustlers selling lanterns, toys, organ oil, handbags and a lot of other things. There is also a souk(market) nearby, in which you can shop for more goods. You may find the prices there are more suitable. Just opposite Kutobia mosque, there are horses parked. If you can bargain with the horse riders, do so and enjoy your first time experience of siting on a horse. You can ask the horse riders to take you anywhere close by for a few dhm. We traveled on a horse to Gueliz new city. In Jemaa el Fna, there are also people with snakes and monkeys. Ask politely if you want to take a picture with a monkey or snake round your neck, they should do it for a few dhms."

The central hub of activity in Marrakesh, i was expecting something spectacular but all i found were half dead snakes, silent musicians and a crazy lady screaming at a tiny plastic cup!! The stalls all sell pretty much the same thing and you could get them cheaper if you head further into the souks. Additionally every manner of con artist is in their element here, you will be charged for taking pictures so be careful and get smothered by professional beggers (i say this because i offered to buy one food because she said she was hungry, she refused the food and wanted money!) some advice steer clear of giving them any money as they work in a network around the square. some people say it comes alive at night having experienced it at night it remained the same!If you have travelled anywhere in south asia you will see the' berber' culture is in no way unique and the whole place had shades of pakistan and india written all over it, This is in no way a bad thing but not what you expect when you read the other reviews people post......draw your own conclusions and look out for the crazy lady with the cup :)"

There are monkeys, snakes, henna ladies, water salesmen and various orange juice sellers and places to eat. To photograph the monkeys, snakes or water sellers you have to pay them 10dh, even if the animals are not on you. Best to pay upfront and then snap a few shots to avoide an issue. They do have spotters so its not worth trying it on the sly. Henna ladies, guide told us some people can have a reaction to an additive the henna mix they use and your hand will swell up very badly and it's possible to be left with a permanent marking as well. Wait until the countryside where you can get an all natural mix, typically more green color than the black used here. Water salesmen, obviously this is tap water, don't drink it. Pay 10 and just take the photo. Orange juice, guide told us this is fresh juice MIXED with water and sugar much like lemonade at home. They don't juice it in front of you so don't trust it if you are avoiding the tap water. Outside the city we saw places where they would cut the oranges and juice it into a clean glass while you watched. We did not eat in the night market but I would have just stopped at a place where local people were dining. We grabbed a kabob to go at a place on the perimeter in the afternoon(20dh). It was fine. We also noticed a small gap between the two restaurants on the perimeter that lead to even more food stands which looked more local and I'm sure had tasty food at even better prices. "

The food was great, cheap as chips (or as they said regularly, cheaper than Aldi, or Asda price!) and we didnt have any 'tummy troubles' at all. Some stalls even made a joke of this saying 'guaranteed diarrhoea free' and 'stall 25 you stay alive!' Enjoy what the locals enjoy, and get fully immersed in what they have on offer.Get haggling, try the street food, have a look round, enjoy listening to the entertainers (even if you put a couple of dirham in the pot - who cares?

This holds true for those \"guides\" who just point in a direction to \"help\" you find your way.The experience is unique with a lot to see, smell, hear, enjoy, but you must be careful as you go around. It is easy to get lost in the market area, just keep your eyes open and try to follow the signs and other tourists.One thing we did learn is don't point at something \"interesting.\" My son made this mistake once and every vendor in the general direction came to us trying to sell their wares.This square completely changes in the night; the musicians come out, they put up food tents (all really good food) and it becomes a bit more lively (not that it's boring during the day). I recommend you visit both during the day and then again at night.Again, this is a neat experience with a lot to see and do, but be ready for crowds, agressive vendors, and A LOT of haggling/ bargaining (even with the \"entertainers\" in the square)."

If you arrive early in the day the square will be littered with snake charmers, palm readers and women offering to give you henna tattoos . Beware, however, that if you take photos of anybody (or anything) you will be demanded to pay 10-20 dirhams. I took a photo of a snake charmer and immediately a man approached and demanded I give him 50 dirhams! I haggled fiercely (which the man appreciated, as negotiating is part of the Berber culture) which ended me paying him 20 dirhams with the condition I take more photos of the snakes and snake charmer. Once inside the souks I found the same attitude towards photo taking - unless you buy something most merchants are not happy with their items being photographed so try to be conspicuous as possible or simply step right up and buy your souvenir! And most likely your seller will have different stores where you can also take photos of his other shops (which happened to me, actually) The second best part of our trip to the Jemaa (The BEST part being the food of course!) was witnessing a carpet auction among local carpet vendors which I later found out only takes place on Sundays. This is when locals from the villages in the atlas mountain come to Marrakech to sell their carpets. It was a neat thing to see!If you are not afraid to explore, to be curius and to have a conversation or two with the locals, there are so many things to discover and enjoy at the Jemaa. Definitely a must!"

One of the guys speak English so you will be taken care of. So good for 30 dirhams. They charge for the olives and bread so decline if you don't want it. We also ate at one of the Harrira stalls. They were packed with locals. For 3 dirhams you get a bowl of hot and filling Harrira soup. To wash it all off, we had the orange juice.

Probably as well to be cautious about the salads. We stuck to peelable fruit. Plenty of band music and dancing in the square too, some of it pretty entertaining.

It's a great place to experience both day and night. I don't recommend the restaurants right inside the square, as they cater primarily to tourists. However try the stalls in the middle where you see Moroccans eating. The food is good and cheap. You can usually make interesting conversation too. :) Solo female travelers the men will make frequent comments to you, but they are harmless. Be firm, yet respectful with them and keep it moving. Currently the International Film Festival is going on and they are showing a film on a big screen in the square every evening. Definitely experience the vibrancy of this square. I highly recommend it!"

Beware of local scammers - they have so many money making activities - I got caught out with a friend looking at henna tattoos - big women grab your hand without asking and start making a Henna tattoo and before you know it they have you sat down and demand money which is quite scary but mainly just a pain in the bum. In november it is relaxed and easy to walk around which was nice - I am not sure if I would be a fan in the high season as I imagine crime is much higher and it would be difficult to get around. I'd love to go back and recommend it to anyone - the food, jewellery, handicrafts, bags, souvenirs and dates/nuts are amazing and the fakes are really good! Better than I have seen in spain and italy."

I want to preface this by saying we went in November when it's a little more off season so we probably didn't get to experience the full craziness of it all. I'll start with the good points:- Amazing orange juice at 4 dirhams per person- The food, of special note is stall 81 on the market which serves the most amazing tagines and cous cous starting at 25 dirham a plate. This is much cheaper than the prices surrounding the main square. - The business and buzz of the area- The view over the main square as the sun sets and you calmly sip a mint teaThe bads are:- All stalls are very repetitive - a lot of cakes and orange juice- You will get hassled a lot more around the square than you do in the actual souks, the henna ladies were a particularly annoying culprit here. They'll henna you without permission and then charge you for it. - Can be hard to find alcohol"

Let's face it, there's no chance you'll go to Marrakech and NOT go to Jemaa el Fna, so you'll all find out for yourselves, but here's a heads up. YES, it's an awesome place full of spices, food, stalls, noices, buying and selling, bars, restaurants, locals selling everything from freshly squeezed orange juice to peanuts, sweets, mint tea and everything else inbtween, monkeys, acrobats, vultures (literally and metaphorically!) snakes (again....). YES, it's surrounded by market traders, barrows, stalls and shops a plenty where you can find a real bargain (if you're prepared to haggle hard and be determined) and meet some real characters. YES, it's one of the few places in the World you'll visit where you'll feel so alive with being totally caught up in your environment and finally......YES, I too completely loved it and would definitely go back at the drop of a hat................howeverAs fairly well travelled as I am, I've never experienced hassle and (in some cases) quite aggressive and oppressive selling tecniques. Not just here in Jemaa el Fna, but in the whole of Marrakech. From the tuk tuk drivers I experienced in New Delhi to the bumsters on the beaches of The Gambia and Red sea resorts of Hurghada, nothing prepared me for this. Obviously I'm not talking about everyone here, just the majority! From walking in front of your face for a dozen yards just to get you to eat at their food stall, to taking a tip themselves out of your change without even asking, to the more extreme cases of actually demanding money with menace. I actually had to intervene with a new young couple who were being told to give a snake charmer \"MORE MONEY\" than they had already just given just for a photo. We all expect tp pay over the odds as tourists, but not 10-15 times the going rate for taxi's, shops etc. Just remember to be strong, don't be intimidated, always check your change and never forget, be polite and courteous but VERY firm.I don't like being negative to I'll try and leave on an upbeat note. Jemaa el Fna is without a shadow of doubt, a must see place in the World to experience and I'm so happy I went. I'd say in it's own way and with everything being relative, it's almost like the New York of the Arabian World. Sure, Northern Africa and the Middle East have much bigger and dynamic Cities, but they are predominatly Islamic. Marrakech is a beautiful melting pot of many different cultures, religions, creeds, nationalities and faiths. In 4 days I saw Chinese, American, African, Indian, Australian, Canadian and from virtually every European Country, including Scandanavia, but Marrakech is far more than just this one square."

However, if you keep on your guard and say 'no thank you' before committing to anything you don't want to do then it can be fun and surreal and at night it's always lively with lots of fun things happening and picturesque scenes and there are also many restaurants around the square which overlook it which beautiful scenes and crazy cheap prices."

During the day it's almost empty but around 6pm all the food and fruits stands just appear from nowhere and fill all the square with light, people and some animals ( monkeys, snakes). The heart of all Moroccan culture is here. Tourists and locals meet here in a mix of caos but in a good way. I read a lot of bad things about women in Morocco but I felt very safe here. I think all women visiting Morocco need to dress according to a Muslim country in a sign of respect. I just love the vibration here."

A dirham or two isn't going to break a bank!Daytime though I was a tad disappointed as it wasn't that full of anything, however night time and this place comes to life in a riot of noise and the smells of many food stalls selling full meals, soups and snails assails your senses.As you walk up and down the food stalls you will be constantly asked to visit their eatery, it is all good humoured and great fun to see the responses to your I'm full or I've eaten whilst trying to decide which one to eat at.All the food is freshly brought in and cooked in front of you near enough so the chances of being ill are probably far far far less here than at your hotel buffet.The musicians start slowly but build up to a crescendo of noise and sounds, all very rhythmic and trance like.Henna tattoos will be offered everywhere by women sitting down, just be careful as the black henna is chemically laden apparently.There are a few market stalls selling wares, again haggling works and there are many juice, spice and fruit sellers. The sweet carts offer excellent value.There are kids who will try to sell you a few toys (the rage was propellers with LED in that float down when we were there) but a polite non merci does the trick.When you've eaten your fill, when your ear drums are full and your legs walked off then sit down in the Cafe Glacier and watch the crowds mill around in front of you.So a bit dull in the day but wow what a place at night...if you can visit just once then make it the night but if you can do both then Jemaa el Fna is a must see."

We first went over during the day time on a private guided tour and it was fairly uneventful, but come dusk, the square lights up with lots of entertainment. I cannot say that I'm a fan of the monkey trainers or the snake charmers - it is clear that these types of entertainment are only in place for tourists and locals are eager to try to rip off tourists for photos and even small talk. It made the experience a little uncomfortable as we were weary to look in the direction of any street performer at the risk that he would want money for our gaze. We did give tips to those who put on interesting dance and music performances that we stuck around to watch, but did not contribute to performances in which we didn't linger around (though we were still asked for pay, even as we were simply walking by which made the square seem more like a site for artistic beggars). The food stalls were the highlight of our trip to the Jemaa el Fna - once we got over the overwhelming pitches from every single stall owner who attempted to physically drag us into seats or follow us around until we agreed to dine at a particular stall, we did have a very affordable meal. Every stall seems to serve the same things - couscous, lamb, chicken, seafood, etc. We finished off our night with a glass of freshly pressed orange juice and grapefruit juice and found it very comfortable to walk around at night back to our hotel that was several blocks away through the medina. A visit to Marrakech is not complete without spending some time in the Jemaa el Fna."

I said no to having the henna, but the lady took my hand and said \"ok, free flower\". I should have said no again, but let her continue. She did my entire hand in the span of 10 seconds and then demanded 400 MAD. I gave her 50 and walked away. Also, the restaurant touts are quite aggressive. This aside, it was a good experience."

A second issue is the Henna painters. The one who painted two tattoos on the hand and shoulder of Olga used brown thick henna. We paid 90 DHM and it all disappeared after a few hours. It was not worth it not even for fun. So beware of the Henna painters on the square itself. We have the feeling that the Djemaa is turning slowly into a fun fair.

            "review": "Tourist trap but should be experienced; just have your wits about you!. We visited Marrakech for 5 days in early October 2013.Marrakech as a whole is supported almost entirely by tourism and it is big business. The square is populated by two groups: (i) locals who are providing goods and services for consumption by tourists; and (ii) tourist who may or may not want them!The square is pretty quiet first thing in the morning with only fruit juice stands. There is perfect competition with every stand selling a glass of juice for 4 dirhams. We had juice every day we were there. It was delicious from every stand we tried. One seller offered us pink grapefruit juice which we thought we'd try for a change until the guy said it was 15 dirhams! We said \"no way\" so he dropped the price to 10 dirhams. Still too much in our opinion but we took it at that. Not worth arguing over a couple of dirhams!There are a number of cafes around the square. Our favourite was Cafe du France which served excellent coffee but sadly no food. Good place to watch over the square.Lots of snake charmers sat under tents making cobras sit up by playing their musical instruments. They leave you alone unless you go over to watch. We didn't get that close as I have an aversion to snakes. We saw some tourists have monkeys put on them and watched them give the owners 50 dirhams (just over \u00a34) for the experience and a couple of photos which was met with hostility. So, beware. Henna ladies offering to paint hands/arms for a fee. They have books with photos of their designs that you can choose from. If you are female, you will be approached but just say no and that usually does the trick. One woman I said no to said she wanted to paint a small design on me for good luck but I said no firmly and with a smile and she was fine.A good tip is to smile if you don't want a service. We found the locals to have quite a good sense of humour. By night, the food stalls dominate the square although the snake charmers, henna ladies, monkeys etc remain out in force. Our only bad experience of the whole trip was eating one time at one of these stalls. As you walk through the stalls, you are practically mobbed by various stall owners waving menus in your face and shouting at you to eat at their stall. Most of the stalls offer identical food save for a few selling snails and sheeps heads/brains. We decided to try one selling mezze and grilled meats. Once we sat down, there was a cheer and clapping. This, we discovered, was not so much because we were going to eat at their stall but because they had 'snared' a tourist who they would attempt to rip off. This, it would appear, is how they operate: the menus are expensive (for eg \u00a34 for some tomato and onion salad - what local would pay a quarter of that?), the portion sizes are tiny and they bring you things you haven't ordered and charge you an enormous amount for it at the end for example, we ordered 4 items from the menu which, given that it equated to approximately \u00a318 we thought would be more than enough for two of us. They served us tiny bowls for us to share and then brought six tiny meat skewers with hardly any meat on them (just placed them in front of us and tried to charge us an additional \u00a314 equivalent for them at the end) plus they brought us a bread roll and two dips (added \u00a33 equivalent for the bread roll alone at the end)! Overall, the quality of the food was less than average, very bland, and there are flies everywhere. We asked for the bill and what came was an unitemised series of figures equating to around \u00a330. We told the guy that we were only going to pay for what we ordered, not that there was much of it. He started remonstrating but we kept firm and said in no way were we going to pay \u00a33 for a bread roll we didn't order or eat for that matter! We asked for the bill to reflect what we ordered. He wouldn't give us the correct bill so, we ended up giving him 200 dirhams which was way too much for what we had. We also said that if he wasn't happy with that, we would be happy to speak with the tourist police. Suddnely, there was no longer an issue. To conclude, I think you should experience eating at the food stalls and if I were to do it again, I would tell them up front that I only want what I ordered and to ask how big the portions are before you order as only then can you assess the value/if you're about to be ripped off! One other tip, don't wear anything nice as you will get totally smoked out and your clothes will smell!There are lots of horse drawn carriages at the entrance to the square and you will be approached by drivers eager to take you on a tour of the city. Nice if you like that kind of thing.About taxis, it's basically a cartel. Ever meter in every taxi bar two was apparently broken (yeah, right)! The two trips we did take wtih the meter on came to under 10 dirhams. The taxis we took on day one cost us 50 dirhams! For the rest of the trip, we refused to pay any more than 20 dirhams per taxi ride anywhere in the city which is more than double what it would cost if the meter was running and the taxi drivers seemed reasonably happy with this. Just wear a smile and be firm and you'll be fine.One last thing on taxis, the maximum fare they can charge from the airport to the sqaure is 70 dirhams. You can see them swimming around like sharks when the planes arrive with fresh bait!! We said we'd take one from the street when they tried to charge us 150 dirhams. Again, just tell them that you've been to Marrakech several times before and it gets the price down, although not to the 70 dirhams it should be. We did manage to pay this on the return journey however. Interestingly, the taxi meter was running and read just over 20 dirhams when we arrived back at the airport but we paid the 70 dirhams as agreed. You have to admire them for trying it on! Top tip: if you don't want to be harranged for services you really don't want, just tell whoever that you've been to Marrakech lots of times before and you know what the deal is. They leave you alone instantly!"

The square is definitely worth seeing, as it is by the the largest open space in the Medina and a lot of people gather there. It is possible to observe the bustle during the day, and spend some time having a drink and watch the world go by. However, come evening time, part of the square is converted into cheap restaurants and it is impossible to walk around without getting heckled constantly by waiters, trying to lure you into their little stalls that go for \"restaurants\". The stalls are numbered, and some locals will swear by the quality of food at their favourite stall. I had a particularly poor experience at stall Number 22, where the waiter pulled a fast one with the bill. We observed it happen to several other guests at the same stall, and we warned others who were arriving as we left. The amount involved was small, but the combination of: a) waiters heckling you constantly; b) poor quality food; c) fiddling with the bill; was enough to discourage future visitors from having high expectations."

There are entertainers, musicians, etc."

We found ourselves looking at the wonderful ceramic plates,wooden ornaments and beautiful lights and as we continued to walk through the alleys we eventually were lost. A young fella said he'd help us get back to the main square 'for free' but led us to the leather market and then demanded money. I have never spelt anything as vile as the combination of pigeon poo and ammonia and the bunch of mint that was given to help eliminate the smell didn't help. We managed to get back to the main square once we found the signs but we noticed we were not the only ones falling into this trap.The square it lovely by night and a lot calmer. If you do buy anything from the souks then haggle - haggle hard. You'll meet some characters that know exactly what to say but don't be fooled. Offer an eighth of their asking price and stick to your guns. If they don't accept, walk away because you WILL find that same piece elsewhere."

            "review": "Hustle and bustle and the daily transformation. Jemaa el-fna goes through a daily transformation to cater for different audiences throughout the day. Starting off with juice stalls and some light entertainment. In the afternoon, the trained Berber monkeys and snake charmers appear followed by younger dancers and henna artists in the latter part of the afternoon and early evening. As the sunset begins, the food market stalls start to appear in the middle along with group entertainments, local story tellers and musicians. As the evening progresses, young children appear with bright toys which they catapult into the air and lamp shade vendors who display their beautiful products to sell. The atmosphere is amazing and the real hustle and bustle starts in the evening. Be prepared to be approached by locals trying to sell you something. Tip 1: If you don't wish to hassled then the trick I have applied when travelling across the world is to look down and never make any eye contact but be aware of the surroundings. If you try to take a picture of the snakes or the men dressed in colourful clothes then expect to be charged for the privilege. Tip 2: Never take picture of local people unless you have have asked for permission.Tip 3: be aware of surroundings as the monkey owners may place the monkey on you shoulder, the hat sellers may put a hat on your head, or you may accidentally trample over a Snake. Tip 4: when approached always smile and say \"la shukran\" if you wish to decline their offering. They are very nice people trying to make a living and please do not be rude or insult them. Keep smiling and be patient they will appreciate it and you will enjoy your timeline Marrakech much better. Never let the hassling get to you, it is part of the experience of large places of gathering and souks. Tip 5: if anyone uninvitingly gives you directions then politely ignore them. Only ask shop keepers or restaurant workers for directions. Jemaa el-fna is safe to visit and enjoy the real experience of culture and food. Don't be scared or be out of by the hustle and bustle. If you really want to get the most out of the visit then 5 Dhm for each act may be worth paying. Eg listening to folk music, dancers, taking a pic of the snakes, monkeys etc....If you want to admire the scenery from a distance with no hassle then goto one of the roof top caf\u00e9s and relax with a coffee or soda and a bite to eat,,Enjoy your time there and keep smiling."

In the morning, workers are trying to clean up from the previous night while shopkeepers and stand owners start to set up their businesses for the day. In the afternoon, the square is a mix of stalls, snake charmers, and all sorts of people trying to separate you from your money in exchange for something. At night, the infamous food stalls are erected and thousand of locals and tourists pour into the square. Drums circles provide the ambience while you eat shoulder to shoulder on benches. Throughout the day, the hubbub will be pierced by the prayer call. Really a must visit if you're in Marrakech and a true experience. Yes you will be constantly harassed by the entrepreneurs that fill the square, but if you can't handle that then what are you doing in Marrakech?"

Went to Jemaa el Fna the week before Christmas as part of an organised trip via Thompsons from our hotel (Rui Tikada Palmeraie- very good hotel btw).It was part of a trip which also included a calege ride (horse and carriage) through some of the more salubrious and affluent parts of Marrakech it has to be said.The cost of the evening's trip was very reasonable and included coach transfer into and out of the city, a knowledgeable guide and a free soft drink in a local caf\u00e9 overlooking the square (not suitable for disabled clients as it involved climbing about 15 stairs-however, the market itself did appear to be wheelchair accessible).Even at 10.00pm the place was abuzz.The smells of the food being prepared in the open air, the spices on offer, the mountain of fresh oranges stacked sky high on stalls and the locals making their own entertainment via an impromptu ensemble of instruments was an experience never to be forgotten-highly recommended.Did we feel safe? Yes, but you need to have your wits about you. It is a well lit place, even at nights, but you need to be firm and keep on walking and not become detached from the main group (this is where the guide comes in handy). Keep your hands in your pocket, don't take much money with you and I am sure you will enjoy the mystique of an unforgettable experience?"

But the center of Marrakech, the Place Djemaa el-Fna, where we kept arriving back after walking for several minutes in a straight line away from it, is filled with snake charmers, fortune tellers, henna tattoo artists, acrobats, turbaned potion sellers, red-robed water sellers, astrologers, healers, Gnaoua drummers, story tellers, beggars of all conditions, shapes and sizes, Berber musicians and, in the evening, food stalls lit with kerosene lamps. We walked around (mostly in circles) and had something to eat, although this was not successfull. We stayed in a quiet and friendly riad in the southern Medina where breakfast and dinner served with style on the roof were memorable experiences, perfect also for watching the many resident storks and doves nesting in and on the Medina walls."

Had really high expectations for Jemaa El Fna. Had read about its history in guidebooks, had heard from others how entertaining it was... not our experience at all. Tacky, hellish place filled with aggressive 'entertainers' demanding money. They will literally band a cymbal in your ear, out comes the hand for money. If someone in a costume is in the vague area of the thing you are taking a photo of, they'll launch at you and demand money. Men punching monkeys in the face because they were pulling at the rusty metal chains around their necks. Men slamming toothless snakes on the ground for not dancing to music, food sellers getting angry when you don't want to eat in their stall, henna tattooists pulling your arms and putting henna ink on you despite repeatedly saying no. All of that in the space of 10 minutes while trying to get from one side to the other. Couple all that jazz with the heat, crowds and noise and it was sadly a harrowing let down. I suppose you've got to see it at least once, to say you've done it. Just be prepared to be hassled, to get angry and irritable and to feel on edge after. And be careful where you eat. My partner was on the loo for three days after eating at the square. Just bad luck I guess. Best advice? Arrive at one of the rooftop bars at about 6pm, get upstairs, get a table, relax and watch it from above as the sun goes down. Take as many pictures as you like. Just avoid watching the monkeys get kicked in the face for not jumping on cue."

The myriad of souks radiate off the northern and eastern edges of the square. In the evenings, a night market of food stalls with tables fills half the square, and the crowds only get bigger. There are Arab story tellers and drum-pounding groups. The one downside is that many of the local populace have their hands out for money constantly. And if you are a visiting foreigner, you will be targeted immediately as a potential sale. But if you've traveled, you'll know how to evade with a smile.The square is partially ringed with restaurants with outdoor terraces on their top floors.

Traditional music blasts from small music stalls and street percussionists attract large crowds of enthusiastic locals who huddle around and clap and sing along to their rhythmic sounds. Nothing is free on the square and in fact anywhere really. Do not attempt to take a picture of anybody, or animal unless you are prepared to pay. Same goes for street attractions. If you stay and watch be prepared to give money. I recommend some of the silverware and traditional clothing stalls. I bought a beautiful traditional teapot which looks very much like silver. Ask the vendor for teapots you can actually use as some are merely decorative and get damaged very quickly if you use them for non decorative purposes. And of course barter for the best price. Definitely a night out at least once when you visit!"

The day time is interesting and enjoyable, with pedlars, performers, and an inconceivable number of orange juice sellers (the juice cheap and unforgettably good). At night even more sellers etc arrive and the whole square becomes a chaotic throng. It's only spoiled by the inevitable pedlars of cheap counterfeit goods, but then you get that anywhere like this.Don't be afraid to eat from the stalls grilling food. Like the orange juice, it's tasty and cheap."

(Those I have asterisked do expect you to pay them if you want to watch them and/or take photos of their 'act').You can have a really cheap dinner there (we did twice - the food was great and between 70 and 110 Dirhams did the trick!There are plenty of restaurants and cafes surrounding the marketplace so if eating a bit 'rough' is not your thing, fear not: there are many options...Not to be missed!"

You'll hear about the henna ladies being sneaky but they are as quick as lighting they just reach out and grab your hand and in a few seconds they've drawn something on you and want money, we were warned by a local guide and I just kept my hands under my shawl. We won't put too much on here about what you'll see in the square so as not to spoil it for you but there are some really interesting things and it's worth wandering through a few times or even getting some lunch or dinner so you can take it all in. We stayed away from the snakes and the monkeys as they were really ill looking and we didn't want to encourage it, most tourists were doing the same as they don't look after the animals well there. But there are plenty of stalls selling herbs, spices, shoes, all sorts of things and they all have well cared for pets outside that you can pick up and play with without getting charged for it."

My husband and I are seasoned travelers and it is not lost on us that in Morocco, where so many have so little, that Canadians must seem rich beyond belief. I must however admit that I have never faced such anger and violent reactions to simple picture taking than in Jemaa el Fna square. We were more than pleased to pay the fee to hold a snake and snap a pic but just standing near a magician or musician with a camera on my shoulder did not merit the response that occurred on more than one occasion. Taking a picture of a food vendor elicited demand for payment. It was awkward and uncomfortable and detracted from what should have been a highlight of the Marrakesh experience. Even the bartering process, that I always find a little distasteful, escalated to a level of anger beyond what I have experienced in other countries. I would not have missed a trip to the square and in fact visited both in the evening and daytime but it is not my fondest memory of Morocco."

We only went in the evening and felt that was enough, far too hot to walk around in the day. 2 hours was more than enough time to explore and try one of the food stalls. Good sales tactics by them, even doing English accents to make us laugh.Lovely time to view the call to prayer people rushing into the mosques. The square suddenly went very quiet so was a great time to walk around and barter a bit more. Always start at a quarter of their price and walk away if they won't budge. They'll lower if they can!Try one of the orange juice stalls for 4 Dirhams, although there's too much choice! Enjoy it!"

If you don't like crowds, hectic scenarios or are put off by scammer's and poverty then I am not sure why you are even travelling to Morocco. But for those of you that love to experience a bit of culture and soak in what Morocco has to offer then this is the place to be. During the day it provides a great place to choose a restaurant/cafe to eat at, yes it may be a little more expensive to dine here as it is in the main square but what is an extra couple of dirhams when you can sit for hours just watching the world go by. The juice carts are functioning at all hours, so treat yourself to a 4 dirham drink when your sweating it out in 40 degree heat. This is a good place to start your shopping and explore the area. Once it gets to about 6pm you see what is the only \"bare\" area in the square start to transform. Heaps of little stores are set up to sell dinner. Mainly the same sort of thing so don't spend to much time choosing one, but you can sit and enjoy a cheap feed, fresh off the grill. The rest of the square, although already seemed full in the day fills up with about 8 times more people and you can easily spend a few hours walking around watching the buskers, musicians etc. I don't fancy watching the snake charmers or money tamers but I am not going to let it bother me. Practices such as these in countries like this probably wont ever change so just carry on experiencing the things you do enjoy and try not to let it upset you. We spent every night down in Jemaa el Fna and found that when we went to other parts in Morocco we missed the action and community attached to having such a festival style main square."

However if unlike me you are a bit more spatially aware of your surroundings at night and want to sample the buzzy feeling of locals enjoying the night life then you will enjoy this authentic atmosphere. Lots of cafes and riads and places to watch the fire eaters and snake charmers from a safe distance. The smells are incredible as this is when the food sellers mainly set up, if you are brave, indulge in some street food crammed in next to other locals at the same table watching 5 foot flames cooking your food, smells are mouthwatering indulgent. By day the square has a more sedate feel. Take your time and meander round the souks, ensure you have your haggling skills ready. Enjoy the moments and keep your wits about you, as lovely as the people are, as a tourist you can meet some shady characters looking to part you from your dirhams.

Its hard to describe the sights and sounds but its a great place - very different just beware if anyone in traditional costume wants you to take a photo as again they expect payment. We took a taxi in and make sure you agree a fare before you get in - we even haggled and got a return trip 2 hours later. If you can speak French then do as they appear to appreciate it. When you visit at night you will be hounded by people trying to get you to eat on the food stalls but just be polite and take it in the spirit it is meant.

We visited Jemaa el Fna initially during the afternoon and although there were a few orange juice sellers and other stalls, together with a few locals attracting the tourists with snake charming and monkeys it all felt a bit of a damp squib after all we had been told. This coupled with the near forty degree heat left us a little deflated but determined to see if the place would liven up later in the evening. And liven up it certainly did.Two days later we set off for Jemaa el Fna once again but this time early evening to catch the sunset over Marrakech from one of the surrounding restaurant rooftops. This time we were not disappointed. Just before seven pm we made our way to the top level of the Hotel Restaurant Caf\u00e9 de France. We had been recommended this place as the best to see the sunset over the city and watch the square come alive. Luckily we made the rooftop just in time to secure a table at the front and over the next hour or so the sun went down and Jemaa el Fna came to life. This was a truly wondrous sight to see from up above. The stalls expanded and just about the whole area was a wash with local vendors, entertainers and seemingly the whole population of the city. What a sight and what a way to see it. On top of the Caf\u00e9 de France, although seemingly a little further away from the action than others, was looking directly at the sun as it descended and this gave us a brilliantly coloured perspective of the whole area. Later we then descended ourselves into the square where we never felt vulnerable or ill at ease. We wandered around the place taking in the activities, the street stalls, entertainers and the abundance of locals and tourists who were there to take in everything Jemaa el Fna had to offer. It was truly brilliant. My advice would be to get a rooftop facing where the sun goes down at about 6.45 pm ( this was September ) and watch the sun set and the square below change. Then head off into the melee below to enjoy one of the spectacles of Marrakech."

Be aware of the snake charmers, henna ladies and the monkey keepers these are all con artists who wait for you to merely glimpse in their direction and them demand payment for nothing. Make sure to keep hold of your handbag or belongings as the square gets very packed and personal space is non existent. There are some lovely items available for sale however be sure to haggle and if possible do not purchase anything on your first visit be sure to check prices as it is easy to get stung by one of the hagglers. The horse drawn carriage looks lovely however the smell of the horses is enough to put anyone off and if it isn't the prices they attempt to charge will make you rather walk back to your hotel. If staying anywhere near the shops such as ZARA and MANGO do not pay more than 100 dirhams for two people to go in the carriage or maximum 15/20 dirhams for a taxi. Do not be afraid to haggle and tell the driver that you will go elsewhere if they do not agree on your price this tends to work most of the time."

Our tour company, Around Morocco, had hired a guide for the day and split the day into two parts for us. The second part was for this time. Idir met us at our hotel and we walked toward the large square. It was still early and the multiple juice vendors were lined up on one side of the square serving lines of customers. The food vendors were setting up and telling us to come back for the \"best food in Marrakesh\". We watched the musicians and snake charmers. Be prepared to pay for the privilege of taking pictures of anything interesting. We found a rooftop terrace to choose a table with a view of the action. We did this fairly early and it was a good thing as it became standing room only in a short time. As the sun set the visions became more and more exciting. The many tall flames from the food stalls were mesmerizing. All of the music reached our ears in a mad jumble. The dancers became even more crazy. There were carriages carrying people into the chaos. The square was very crowded. This was everything I hoped for on my last night in magical Morocco."

You can rake as many photos as you like but have a 5dh in hand after your done for them and just walk away. At night, hundreds of people gather and it can be annoying when the food people harass you to eat there. If you do eat, just go to the busiest one and sit down. As a woman, I already did my research and knew what to expect but they took it up a notch. Being Asian I stuck out and might as well had a bulls eye on me. Everywhere was \"hey Japan, konnichiwa, sexy (I always wore a scarf,pants and sleeved shirt). This was tiring and seemed to followed everywhere I went. I was touched a few times and that was when I had enough and shouted back for them to leave me alone in French. I heard there are uncovered tourist police but I didn't see their help."

During this time, we mostly saw tourists milling around, having their pictures taken & taking it all in.By the time the sun sets behind the Koutoubia mosque, the place completely changes. People flock to the square (locals & tourists alike) to experience & be part of the unique atmosphere. Dozens of open-air restaurants are set up & smoke rises from the hot grills cooking lamb, kebas & seafood. Eating at one of these stalls is easy, grab a seat, wait for the menu, order, wait five minutes & enjoy. The whole experience is somewhat magical - there's nowhere else quite like it & it's amazing how it changes.We were hooked on the place during our two-night stay & ate here both nights. It's also worth getting up onto the terraces of one of the surrounding cafe's to take photographs & watch how it changes.This was without doubt, the highlight of our trip & the smells, sounds & sights more than make up for the hassle you might get from the locals wanting you to spend some of your money."

The horse carriages congregate here so always a good place to pick one up, but always agree your price first!We enjoyed two evenings by eating on high terrace restaurants and looking down over the square as the evening unfolds, it is a mass of people, bustle, trading, and energy.Be wary of your purse and wallet, although we had no negative experiences. Never allow a henna artist to take your hand as once pulled in they have you caught and will paint henna on your hand whether you want it or not and then charge you, even if the sentence begins, \"free for you pretty lady\"!As other reviews have stated nothing is free, whether it is advice, directions or holding their monkey/snake (whether you wanted to or not) so be wary.

However, finding a place to eat can get a little stressful, as all the vendors are yelling at you to try and get you into their stall, and we found a few to be very rude when we declined their offers. I personally don't like the monkey on chains and snakes with venom removed, for the tourists to be photographed with during the day, and as charming as some of the little stores are with beautiful trinkets for sale, this was marred again by rude traders when we declined their services.A must see and do on a trip to Marrakech, and whether you love it or loathe it, you will remember it forever."

So find out for yourself. Only words of advice being. Just take care to guard against 'friendly' locals who want to give you directions, unless you want to part with cash (or have a row about not parting with cash after being followed for a bit).Enjoy."

There was some exquisite kind of taste in the fried fish and kebabs that we had. It\u2019s quite enjoyable with so much of hustle bustle, but you should always be careful about the pickpockets.

Just make sure you dress down, don't carry any valuables with you and if you want to take pictures of what you see, make sure you have some Dirhams in your pocket because they will shame you into paying something for your photo. Everyone is trying to make a Dirham in this place so bring lots of change.

            "review": "Some tips for a great visit. The square is indeed chaotic- very fun and so much energy. Prior to coming I read many reviews about trouble people experienced on the square..we did not have any issues at all in the 5 days that we were in Marrakech. We had a great time people watching and exploring. I think this review is more about tips for the square...Yes, there are snakes and monkeys that are thrust at you in demand of money, but when you see them, simply walk around and they will not bother you. DO NOT take pictures (at least from where they can see you) unless you want to get shouted at..and if you do want to take a picture, simply ask! It's so easy to do but most people don't. If you do happen to want your picture taken with the snakes/monkeys/musicians/acrobats...whatever, negotiate a price BEFORE you start. In all our interactions in Morocco we found this is the only way to get a fair price. If you sit with the monkeys etc. and take pictures and then try to pay, they will demand silly amounts of you. We sat on a terrace and watched this fun for hours at a time. People handle this is so many ways. Be firm, but do not get angry when setting a price. The snake charmers come up to people and try to shake your hand and when they have your hand they put the snake around your neck. If you do not want this, but want to take pictures with the snakes, negotiate a price first and they will respect what you ask of them. Once you pay, you are their client and they are happy to let you get some really fun pictures. We saw many people negotiate a price first and they were not harassed with snakes around their necks. Same goes for the monkeys. We took tons and tons of photos without having to pay anything simply by asking first. The vendors will usually even smile and pull a pose for you :)The henna ladies will also try their charms on you- set a price in advance. I had one lady grab my arm and try to put henna on it while I was walking away..just keep walking... The food stall vendors can be somewhat aggressive in their tactics, but the best way to avoid this is to select a place to eat prior to walking down the center walkways, and just go and sit down. We tried looking at menus and viewing the food for offer, but this lead to the vendors pulling at us and demanding that we sit down. They seemed to put their hands on me to stop me from walking, but did not do so to my husband... it wasn't really aggressive, but be prepared for this. Stall #1 is excellent- we ate there twice. The staff speaks English (as well as Spanish, French...etc.), They serve you quickly and are honest and attentive. There are many, many things to buy on the square. You can get a reasonable price. If you want cheap souvenirs there are many set price shops with items starting at 10 dirhams. We got many little things in this way. For larger items, stand firm! Also, do not start negotiations unless you actually want the item. If you spend 15 minutes talking about the price, then walk away, it can lead to yelling. Some vendors will throw the item into your hands so you catch it, and then demand you pay...I just put the item nicely on the floor and said NO. As far as pick pocketing...we only met one lady who had been robbed- she left her wallet in the outermost pocket of her backpack, and left it on her back. If you have a bag, keep it zipped and carry it in front of you and there will be no issues. Use common sense!For attire- respect their culture, they are Muslim! While they are of course used to seeing tourists wearing all sorts of clothing, just remember that you are in their country and cover up a bit (ladies). They will try and touch you or say rude things if you are dressed scantily. Also, if you cover up a bit and want to wander through the local areas of town, you will feel much more comfortable and will get no hassle from the locals. If you want to eat at the restaurants off the square- look where the locals are and sit there. We ate at so many places and the best were found by following this advice. We went to a few with only tourists- worst meals of our trip. You can easily find harira (soup) for 15 dirhams, tajines for 30 and water (1 L) for 10. Cheap and delicious. A super great place to people watch is from the top of the hotel nearest the snakes (I will find the name and update this soon). There is a mandatory charge...just grab a drink from the cooler (they are 20 dirhams), pay, and grab a seat. We literally spent about 2 hours here a night. You will not get bored people watching. If you have a good lens on your camera, you can get really great monkey/snake pictures. It's a fight for the nice seats at the edge of the terrace overlooking the square- get there a bit before sunset for spectacular pictures and great seats. This review may make the square sound intimidating, but it's more cautionary advice. Please enjoy the place- it's unlike anything you've ever seen! Above all, do not let it stress you out and do not get angry. Stay calm and enjoy! My husband and I travel frequently around the world, and these are really good tips to follow."

The square at night is a crazy experience but one you don't want to miss (watch out for pickpockets so you don't end up missing your wallet!) We spent a few nights dining on roof terraces at restaurants that overlook the square while we watched the whole thing as it's set up. We even saw a fight break out among the acrobats that were entertaining people. Tajines were thrown and a wicked looking knife was grabbed from a nearby sales stall. Thankfully, we were safely on the roof terrace at Les Premices. Don't forget to take one of the horse-drawn carriages for a nice, breezy tour of the city. Enjoy!"

There are so many people here in the evening, especially on a Sunday night and there are really no rules to this place. OK, there probably are, but with what we saw I'd say you're in for an interesting experience. Food vendors set up in the evening and we had wonderful vegetable, lamb, and chicken kabobs. The smell is amazing. We brought some ion for our stomachs and luckily we didn't get ill! While sitting there two Moroccan men got into an argument and started trading punches. Other than that it was peaceful. You'll hear the standard music, drums, and storytellers. You'll see the snake charmers, monkey wranglers, and henna tatoo swindlers. I say swindler because she swindled my wife out of 200 dirhams. It lasted only a few days. Also, beware of the musicians and charmers, if you have our camera out (not evening snapping a photo) they will think you took a photo and actually chase you around the square for a tip (cough fee cough), just as one did to me (hint: take a video of the madness from the safety of a restaurant's balcony). Around the square you'll find some of the more established restaurants, but some can seem a little too touristy, even if the food is phenomenal. We used a restroom in one of the restaurants; just order something like a drink or snack. Although we felt slightly weird being dressed in western clothes, we still wore pants and covered our shoulders to be respectful of the local culture, but we saw everything from shorts and flip flops to full burkas, so anything goes. Near the end of the square is the Koutoubia Mosque and the opposite end houses the famous souks. Get lost in them, that is the point! Go to Marrakech and enjoy, it's safe (except for one day in 2011)!"

It's crazy, and you'd be crazy not to witness the craziness.On the other hand, it's crazy. From the moment you step onto the square (and possibly before) you are likely to be absolutely accosted by tons of buskers. People will do a little dance, put a hat on your head, and expect money. People will come up behind you and put a snake on your back, then expect money. When watching a show on the square, people will act like they are taking money for the performers but, in reality, they are just keeping it for themselves.I also found the shows to be rather boring. Some dudes beating drums and hollering. A Moroccan Ron Jeremy lookalike screaming at crippled people until they walk. Ladies trying to read your fortune. Etc., etc., etc.When you go bring a lot of 1dh coins! Often that is the only way to get people to leave you alone, and if you respond \"I don't have any money\" they are not likely to believe you, even if it's true."

It is different by night when the whole square comes to life with food stalls. If you get the opportunity try both day and night as it is a different vibe.

While slightly overwhelming at first as there are thousands of people crammed in to one area, you can eventually see that all of the vendors have their own place to be. In addition to the number stalls, there are a variety of people (entertainers, artists, animal charmers, etc) who bring a stool or blanket and sit in the same spot each night. The food vendors seem to sell all the same thing for the same price. They have their most charming workers in front of the stalls, trying to persuade you to eat at their booth. Most have mastered a few tag lines in English - we selected our stall based on the funniest line we heard. Stay away from soup and salad, especially during the summer months, as they are most likely to spoil in the heat. Question what your waiter offers/brings you, as many times they place additional plates (olives, french fries, eggplant patties) in front of you, regardless of what you ordered, and then demand that you pay for them at the end of the meal. Be cautious when standing near the snake charmers, monkey men, musicians, and henna ladies - the majority of them will demand payment for observing of photographing them. This is how they make their living, so are very good at making sure they collect from you =)There is a public bathroom available near the police station (across from the alley where the horse and carriage line is). A man sits at the bottom of the stairs to collect the fee (1 Dk, I believe). Be prepared this is NOT a Western bathroom...I was shocked to open the stall door and find just a squatting hole. It was an eye opening encounter and made me appreciate even more all the luxuries I have at home. We were so fascinated by the square that we returned the next two days, both during the day time and after sunset.

All the food seems the same listed but Stall 1 spinach was amazing and spicey. Just be warned of all the hassle you will get to try and pick a food stall but by saying you remember their number and you will pop back later seemed to work.. although it feels very repeative after the 10th time!

The square starts getting lively around 8pm, when the heat of Marrakech is finally bearable. There are the notorious snake charmers (actually pretty lame) and monkey men (kinda cool from a distance). Bear in mind that a picture with either of these animals will cost you a pretty penny if you don't negotiate a price ahead of time. There are also the rows and rows of 4Dh freshly squeezed orange juice carts. All of the juice is pulpy and delicious, very refreshing on a hot day in Marrakech. And finally, there's the hundreds of food stalls.Some tips for food stalls:-ask if the bread and olives/sauce costs extra (it usually does and this is where they try to make their money)-look at the prices on the menu ahead of time; know how much your bill will be-problems with the food are rare, but be wary of undercooked chicken and fish that has been sitting in the sun all day-lastly, have some fun! The stall owners are always funny guys who love their customers. Stay long enough and he'll be insisting that you have mint tea on the house, followed by pictures with the stall owner.Jemaa el Fna is a place to have fun. Be friendly to the market people and your experience will be pleasant."

There were dozens of orange juice stalls- we didn't eat anything or drink anything here, snails, men with twirling hats and googly eyes, mean henna women, drumming and singing, fluorescent toys thrown at us, men with monkeys and lots and lots of local people. We felt a little out of place wondering around, but weren't bothered too much. I have a pretty solid, stern \"no, don't talk to me face\" when approached by merchants. No henna ladies tried to tattoo my arm, but the monkey men did get awfully close to us with their monkey's hands which we didn't like at all. That required a very stern NO and dirty look not to touch us with their monkeys! We tried to enjoy the drumming and the music circles that all of the locals enjoyed but as soon as they saw us, 6-7 rows back, the immediately approached us and asked for money. Even if we weren't apart of the circle and just standing nearby, we were scolded for not giving money. One group was a lot of fun to watch, had teenage boys in the center dancing away to this wonderful beat. We listened for about 10 minutes, then were quickly approached by a stern faced man demanding money. If he didn't demand and expect us to pay we might have reacted differently, or given more than we gave. We were surprised by the organization of this square. Every type of merchant had their own spot, food merchants in one spot, soap/oil sellers lumped together and drumming and singing in one corner. Overall, it is worth a look but watch out for those monkeys!"

We only ate at a stall once after being warned by our hotel manager about poor food hygiene practices, we didn't suffer from any ill effects.We took a horse and carriage ride, after a bit of shopping around we got it for 200 DHS for an hour which compared to some of the money people wanted for looking in their direction was a bargain.I refused to have a photo with any monkeys as they were being kept in poor conditions in small cages.I stupidly wanted a photo of a snake and should have stuck to my guns and agreed a price beforehand or just walked away as they asked for 600 DHS afterwards, no they didn't get that but suddenly felt very intimidated. Until reading this forum today I hadn't realised they sew the snakes mouth shut to stop them biting, I had wondered why I hadn't read of dead tourists. I wish I hadn't taken the photo now because of this.The souks were interesting, we were never hassled, all the banter we had when we stopped to look in a stall was friendly. There were a few lads who would insist we were going the wrong way back to the square even though we knew we weren't.I can't see how these people make a living, there are so many stalls all selling the same stuff, if one was to diversify they would make a killing.The orange juice is the best bargain at 4 DHS, the Vin Diesel lookalike at number 37 was the nicest seller.The weekends at the square are unbelievably busy, worse than Oxford Street in the sales. If you are struggling to find somewhere to eat there is always the KFC opposite where the horses are stood.I don't know if many of the restaurants 'dumb down' the Moroccan food for tourists but I found most of it very bland, certainly not what I was expecting from the proliferation of spice stands."

Luckily for me and my wife, we have experience in these environments. The shop Guijjane which is opposite the hotel restaurant caf\u00e9 de France was the best shop and shopping experience of my trip to marrakesh. It was owned by a young man named Redouan. He was the nicest guy I met in the whole of morroco. I genuine human and an excellent salesman man. His store was a souvenir shop which was the lowest fixed prices with no hassle from the worker's in the whole of jema el fenna. Ideal shop for acquiring tasteful gifts for a low price. Taking plenty of chewing gum for haggling with is a good idea. This place could be over whelming to the weaker minded person. Personally me and my wife didn't enjoy the food from the square. Over priced with no taste. Local restaurants and caf\u00e9s serving food to locals is the better option. The shopping experience itself is awesome and overall the people of morroco are very good.

Firstly this is a place to keep your wits about you. There are lots of people here targeting tourists to rip them off or pickpocket them, so keep your valuables in a zipped bag in front of you. During the day there will be the orange juice stalls, which is delicious and only 4 dirhams. Apparently the quality can vary so when you find one you like stick to it. Also by midday there will be ladies wanting to henna your hands, I declined this saying i was allergic. Be careful with this some of the henna can be rather toxic and if you do this agree a price/design before you start. There are lots of snake charmers and drummers etc. Again be aware if you take photos money will be demanded sometimes very aggressively. There were also men with monkeys dressed in clothes, on leads etc. I find this practise cruel and inhumane the animals are often drugged and mistreated. I'd urge tourists not to have photos with them and not to give them money to try to stop this. Also there are many stalls here but you'll get much better deals in the souk. At night the place is full of food stands, we had delicious meat skewers from stall 1. Be aware they will try to get you to have more than you want, if you don't want bread etc just say. If they give you something they will expect paying for it at the end. We loved the cinnamon tea for 3 dirham and found this a great people watching spot. If you're a good customer you may well find your glass topped up for free to keep you at a stall."

May sure to ask for \"No ice\" though. We were not keen on the snake charmers and trained monkeys so we just walked around them and were never hassled. It was all too obviously touristy. Snake charmers in India are much better ;) At night Jemaa el Fna turns into a magical place. The whole square is illuminated by thousands of lanterns that are placed on the ground by the lantern sellers. There are musicians and especially drummers that create a constant sound and rhythm that the whole square almost feels like it's moving. The vibe felt Arabian nights mixed with Africa just as it should."

We were really looking forward to visiting the Souks and Jemaa el Fna however, despite my 19yr old daughter dressing conservatively, she was constantly shouted at with males coming right up to her face. On one occasion, it felt as if a man was trying to come between us. He passed us several times (talking on his phone) and each time either bumped against one of us or tried to use the crowds to weave between us. We left immediately! On another occasion we started to look at some woodwork and were then immediately surrounded by men who would not let us leave. The mopeds are a pain and you are constantly jumping out of their way!! Also, will someone please tell the caf\u00e9 touts that shouting 'you will not get diarrhoea' does not attract the customer to the food!!"

There are, of course, lots of snake charmers, hena tattoo painters, acrobats, dancers, mountain man, and the like, trying to get your attention. With the exception of the tattoo ladies (who are selling a service), the others are trying to get paid for photographs. Curiosities they may be, none of them appears attractive.

It distressed me that we tourists come to gawk and marvel at this sight.At night, the place transform into a food market with raws and raws of food stalls.

We had a paninis at yazzis (thinks its called that) very cheap and you can watch it all at eye level but no one bothers you (unless people selling cigs) we went to several cares around there and all nice and cheap, great shade to watch everyone go by. Be prepared to haggle. And dot ask he price unless you really want it,my husband wanted some dr dre beat headphone and the man said he couldn't take less that 300, we walked off then he said we could have them for 150. Go careful about when they give you change. I saw alot of police and undercover police patrolling around which makes you feel safe. Go at night too as it completely changes from the day.

By day it is a hot open square with a few canopied market stalls selling lots of different crafts, food and drinks. By night it gets much busier as new stalls, barrows, lights and performers fill it with every kind of item to buy and all manner of improvised shows to watch.The maze of souks lead directly off the square and it's handy to have a small map to guide you back once you go in to explore the thousands of little stalls, workshops and tiny industries within it. They are unbelievable and you shouldn't feel intimidated at all - just a constant gentle persistent babble of attention seeking from the many stall-holders all vying for your attention and of course money to spend on their wares. The souks are an unbelievable sensory treat with colours, smells, sights, tastes and textures constantly changing throughout as you walk through them. DON'T MISS OUT! We didn't encounter one aggressive person but some are very persistent and people (often children) will offer to lead you to a \"spice market\" in exchange for a few dirhams. My advice would be don't engage eye contact or chat to them, which seems harsh as they're being friendly, or you'll be constantly approached and begged for coins before they leave you alone, only to be replaced by another eager face. You can also find yourself being led on a goose-chase to nowhere and have to find your own way back which is just a waste of holiday time.Our teenage lads were fine with the busyness and excitement of it all but smaller children (under 10s) might find it a bit intimidating. Even so, we found the Moroccans were child-friendly and generally polite.You should definitely go at least once, get a feel for the geography and go back and explore more for yourself. We took a guided tour for our first visit (booked in the hotel via Thomson) which was an ideal introduction, then did two more two hour visits under our own steam in the early evenings. To be honest, two hours was enough as it's a madly intense, slightly surreal but a genuinely fun experience. Amongst the crazy confusion of amazing sights and magical smells we saw snake charmers, monkeys, huge pots of spices, miles of beautifully coloured hanging fabrics and a woman quite clearly casting a spell on a little jar of something she was mixing in it! You've got to take it as it is- but that's surely why you travel in the first place ?Top tips.Even if you speak French or Arabic, don't chat or you may engage a persistent new friend who is hard to shake off.Be prepared to haggle- start at 25 to 30% of the asking price and go up to 40- 45% max depending on what you think things are worth. Remember that these traders have to earn a living but nerve is everything when you bargain. ( We bought a bag for \u00a36 which started at \u00a336) Be prepared to walk away if the price is too high and you may actually be pleasantly surprised! Traders expect to be beaten down and ultimately they're experts. Very few stalls have any prices showing ( a few do ) so don't feel intimidated. Almost everyone we bought from was charming and friendly and not in a purely \"give us your money\" way either.Visit an upstairs cafe on the edge of the square for a cooling drink and some time away from the busyness. Also great for taking photos.Anyone you take a picture of will expect a small payment. Give what you think it's worth.Be aware that you may be approached by men with monkeys or snakes asking for money in return for you taking a photo. Unless you want one either avoid them, ignore or just say no thanks. It's not rude as there are so many people constantly asking you for something, yet it's not half as intimidating as it sounds!As you enter the square you may be approached by guides (claiming to work for \"the government\" but clearly don't). Harmless and probably genuine but maybe not, so avoid unless you want an unofficial tour.Finally, someone described the Square and souks as \"an assault on your senses without any pain\" which is a pretty accurate description. This is an amazing place to visit and once is enough for some people but we had to go back for more. Don't avoid it as it's as close to engaging with Marrakech's busy culture as you can get as a visitor. You will ALWAYS have lasting memories of your visit here so just go for it."

During the day it is a rather dull, hot open space, with not much going on. In the evening it becomes home to lots of food stalls and street entertainers. The food is rather ordinary Moroccan fare, kebabs, sheeps's heads, tagines, etc, but do eat where the Moroccans eat, as some of the tourist places can be ridiculously overpriced and poor quality. One place to avoid is the \"lovely jubly, ASDA price\" guy at one of the first stalls you find as you arrive from the taxi rank, very friendly until you question the bill (some friends paid nearly 30 Euros for the same meal we had in the Kasbah for less than 3 Euros). The other thing to be aware of is that the street entertainers are there to earn a living. Taking a photo of a snake charmer, dance troupe, monkey, etc. will require payment. Many people don't pay, but if you don't, you will get a very aggressive reaction, although usually only verbal. The square is also full of pickpockets, con artists, sexual predators and muggers, keep your street smarts about you and avoid talking to strangers. Despite all these negatives, it is worth visiting for one evening and the square is surrounded by some pleasant roof top and terrace bars where you can relax with a coffee after all the madness."

Also, if you're thirsty, get the 10 Dirham orange juice...freshly squeezed orange juice.Unlike the guide books say, women do not need to cover-up or are not made to feel uncomfortable by the locals when wearing shorts, skirts, or vest tops etc. Just take a lot of 10 Dirham coins in change to buy things with, and be prepared to pay when taking photos of people and their monkey/hat/stall/\"talent\".Oh...and watch out for kids riding large bikes they can't control, mopeds, or anything else that moves quickly and can crash into you."

The main square is a crazy place with snake charmers, monkeys and we even saw a vulture at one point, Be aware that if you take pictures you will be expected to hand over some money and will harassed to do so. You can be sneaky as we were and went to a terraced cafe and took some distance photos from there. The orange juice is lovely to drink when it is really hot. We didn't sample any of the food because we didn't want to take the risk but there seem to be people sitting down to eat, particularly at night time. You must take a trip at night when it is completely different from daytime. The square is much busier and you will see different things like dancing and story tellers. We did venture down some souks but remember what twists and turns you take because it is so easy to get lost. There is lots of haggling to be done and we got some real bargains. Make sure you agree prices before you do things like henna and photos. When you haggle offer 75% of the price they give you and start from there.

Earlier in the day we stumbled across a little stall in one of the lanes near to the square- cooking small tagine pots over a bbq. we ordered one out of curiosity - it was bbq vegetables in stock and it was delicious we had 2 lots, bread and 2 drinks for just 50dh! Marrakech is an amazing city. Marrakechies are so friendly and they have a wicked sense of humour. Locals do want you to visit their own shops and will ask you for a small payment for showing you around but what's a quid or two here and there for some local company and good humour. We had an awesome Hammam and massage at les bain d'alhambra for just 450 dh. We went in at 1710 and came out at 2000! You can eat posh nosh too- try Azar- it's good and they have. Shisha! Cocktails at La Mamounia are overpriced but worth it anyway..... It is lush. Word of warning though, the security guard initially wouldn't let us in - he said it was because we had flip flops on.... so we had to work on him a bit to let us in. It was about midnight on a tues eve so may be why.All in all a really wonderful few days and a great city to come to for a short break.

There are also men with pipes and snakes and acrobats etc. If you stand to watch they expect you to pay. Interesting to watch though! Traffic just goes where it wants. At first I was very wary but you soon get used to the bikes etc riding up beside you from behind! Women sit with stools and umbrellas offering to do henna tattoos. By evening the place really comes alive. The cooking smells are wonderful and the food does look delicious! There is music and all the other stuff that was there during the day. Some young men offer to show you round the souks for free, but like everyone else they want to be paid so don't believe them. I went to Marrakech because I watched a youtube video of Jemaa el Fna. I have to say it did not disappoint. It was certainly an experience!"

Don't be afraid to stop anywhere in the surrounding cafes, they are all very much evenly priced and you can just go in and order a tea or soft drink, sit on the top terraces and watch the world go by. They do not expect you to order a huge meal and are quite happy for you just to have a snack or a drink. If you want to buy any herbal remedies or perfumes this is the place to buy.

We found everyone we encountered to be very friendly and if we weren't interested we just kept walking. The most fun is the bartering - stand your ground!

I was warned by my riad not to partake from the places in the square. I watched many tourists seated and eating there but it was a risk I was not willing to take. The entertainers, usually in Arabic, can tell stories, jokes, have plays, play music, and dance in the square for a few dirhams. If you take a photo or video expect to pay a few dirhams too. This is an excellent place for pick pockets. The crowds can be large and when watching the entertainers your focus shifts from your self protection to the show. Otherwise like most of Marrakech it is very safe at all times of day and night.Depending on the time you spend on the entertainers and shops you can spend a few hours here. There are also some eateries with balconies along the square. These make for great seating during sunset and to watch the square really come alive in the evening. Get there early to get a good seat."

Perhaps it is fitting that under this square exists a notorious government interrogation facility.

In addition, while this square is touted as quintessentially Moroccan, tourists outnumber locals at least 3 to 1--at least in the high travel season."

Certainly there were tourists there, but we felt many were local people, enjoying a warm spring evening. It was fascinating to people watch. Although we couldn't understand the story tellers, watching the expressions on the faces of the older women and men sitting around the actors was unforgetable. A short distance away, young boys that couldn't get through the crowds were watching from above, propped in trees and moving to the music playing loudly for the younger generations. Watching people enjoy the many food offerings was another great experience, especially the ones putting away great quantities of snails! And although the snake charmers and monkey handlers were likely there mostly for the tourists, our young grandson treasures the picture of the monkey that jumped up and sat on his grandfather's head. We did not see any animals being mistreated and certainly didn't feel any of the monkeys were dressed in ways more degrading than some of the ways we have seen people dress their dogs at home. We loved every minute, even went back for more, and never felt we were being unduly pressured (obviously sellers of anything will try to sell their wares), or pushed around. A simple \"no thank you\" was all we ever needed to say. We didn'd try eating at any of the food stalls on \"ground level\" but did enjoy sitting outside in the upper restaurants where we had great views of all the goings on and enjoyed light meals and coffee breaks."

Animal trainers had poor animals that made me feel quite sorry for them (the animals), having to endure all the stress of the noise and the performance on demand. The food stalls offer tiny portions of food that is not really tasty or cheap, compared to other places where we had food (including many roadside butcher/grill shops where the food was much more flavorful and the setting a lot less touristy).

We just walked through the first night, and decided that we needed to know exactly which stall to go to before wandering through and then make a surgical strike so as to avoid the hassle.We decided on number 114 based on other travelers' reviews, and were disappointed. First of all, they were just as aggressive, even when we were headed straight to their stall. Second, the chicken was way overcooked and dry, and the couscous was served on the teeniest and most overloaded plate, so it was impossible to cut said chewy chicken without getting couscous all over the table. The veggies were overcooked to the point of mush, and also without much flavor.Once you're sitting down, the wait staff is friendly enough, and it does have a great view of the market, though be warned, you will be hassled by the paintings, jewelry, tissue and desert vendors as you eat. They invite you to the \"kitchen\" to see what you will be getting before you order it, The best meal in our group was by far the mixed kebab skewers of veggies, meat, chicken, lamb and sausage. The diners at stall 117 just next door seemed to be having more fun, so give that one a try instead."

It can be a bit intimidating but if you remain polite with the hordes of people trying to sell you something and the packed streets into the Souk it is a sensational experience. We ended the evening by eating in a Riad."

            "review": "Absolute Chaos But Embrace It !. My partner and I recently visited Marrakech and came here most days - what an experience!Our first visit was on the day we arrived and we were a little taken aback by the spectacles in the street; monkeys (in clothes & nappies), snakes (cobras & pythons), henna artists, dancers & musicians.... completely nuts! This was fabulous to observe however be mindful of where you walk and keep your wits about you as we were approached very suddenly by a man who practically threw his monkey onto my partners arm whilst another man approached with his smaller monkey, another with a camera and then a lady offering henna! We must have stuck out as new tourists to the area and it was a little overwhelming to begin with. Obviously these people want paying to allow you to have photographs and hold the monkey but they leave little time to negotiate prices before they place the animal in your arms. They tried to charge us 100 dirhams for both (\u00a38) but we managed to get away with paying 70dirhams. BEWARE the monkey actually bit my partner, thankfully he didn't break the skin but these are still wild animals and still caused havoc by snatching our sunglasses and hair clips before throwing them across the square... Only in Marrakech!There is also plenty of restaurants to grab some lunch or drinks, both in the square and off the side roads which is a nice rest bite from the craziness. Also in the Jemma El Fna locals have their own little stalls and what only can be described as car boot style areas where they sell the traditional items (tagine pots, cosmetics, jewellery, hats, shoes, ornaments etc etc). These are positioned in the centre and around the square. Be prepared to haggle (advisable to offer 45% of the asking price) and stay strong with your price THEY WILL BACK DOWN! You can grab some really great bargains! During the day we found this to be quite tame compared to the evening, at night the place comes alive! As mentioned already there is this and more - the stalls are set up where you will find rows of local Moroccan food being cooked. We didn't try this however I have read that it's a must do in Marrakech and the food is meant to be good very tasty and very good value. We were recommended to try stall # 31....As it's outdoors it is free to go and turn up which is great if you are travelling on a budget. It's the sort of place you can visit again and again, and probably spend a few hours walking round or simply sitting with a drink taking in the atmosphere. Top Tips:* Be prepared to tip and pay for almost everything - photos, looking at items etc! Be assertive if you are not interested and don't ask how much if you don't really intend to buy. * Go with an open mind - it is dirty, there are animals dressed up, there are mopeds whizzing around everywhere and the locals can be very persistent but remember this is Morocco!"

Now imagine that loads of other people are going in your direction, again interspersed with mopeds, bikes etc and randomly stopping to look at things in shops, stalls etc. Now imagine doing this on the dark, whilst walking around people sitting on the floor, doing henna tattoos, snake charming, trying to get you to pose with monkeys, or trying to sell you crap you don't want to buy or give you directions to a place you don't want to go to! Now throw in dwarfs, acrobats, crippled beggars, drummers, musicians, people throwing stuff in the air, hawks, hawkers and just random mad stuff. That is Jemaa el Fna!!!Totally mad and fascinating place to visit, great for people watching.

I recommend using a small empty water bottle to get filled with fresh orange juice from the stalls there as the glasses are not always clean and are often reused but the juice is delicious. Nearby the Patisserie of Princes has amazing icecream in great flavours for a good price, all the classics plus fig, cinnamon etc. Ask for hotel Tazi if you are in the square and you will pass the icecream shop/bakery on the way."

Late morning, some action begins as surrounding square vendors prepare to get ready for a new day of brisk business. As the heat penetrates, it surprisingly gets busy. Everything from pedestrians, donkeys, tourist vans, and buggies circumvent this open square. But, something different lies just beyond the setting sun.... this square becomes electrified! The story tellers come, the snake charmers play their mesmerizing tunes, women offering to henna plumped from heat hands, and the best part, all the wonderful food vendors set up shop! Tajine, couscous, fish of all sorts, harissa sauce for dipping bread, mixed salads, sweets and all vendors vying for your business! #1 is great, #20 is accommodating when doing take out and escaping back to your riad to eat in peace, #65 has a very lovely host, not too agressive. What a spectacle, not for all. But, one must experience this incredible world. I love this Square and Medina for all those opposing things, the energy, aggressiveness and plentitude.

Beware though, you need to keep your wits about you. Nothing is for free, the guy who pops his hat on your head and says he wants to be in your photo for free will change his mind the minute the flash goes off. I would recommend avoiding walking between the area of sit-down food stalls if you aren't looking to buy anything. We had a crappy experience just strolling through there where a waiter ran up and asked for money for cokes we had bought earlier on in the day elsewhere, and then another waiter conveniently came to our \"aid\" and we were soon tightly surrounded by all these staff. When we walked away from them my partner realised the money belt hidden under his t-shirt was halfway open, and we recalled that just before the first waiter asked for money another had rubbed my partner's belly in passing and yelled \"we need to fatten this one up\". Code? Who knows. We were lucky that time.I also had a woman start drawing on me with henna without warning or permission, which gave me a fright. Gear yourself up to say \"La shukran\" (no thank you) to the many people who will try to lead you to and from Jemaa el Fna, you just have to keep doing what you're doing and be polite but firm until they leave you be (they want money for helping you).Enjoy!"

Be prepared for heads of lamb lying next to a lamb barbecue, motor scooters almost running over you in the small streets of the souk on your way to that main square...We arrived at the airport, unloaded our baggage at the hotel and then and went on Jemaa el Fna square for dinner. We parents loved it, for the children this kind of start into a foreign culture was a bit heavy! So if you are travelling with children, maybe don't eat there the first evening, but let them go acquainted with moroccan culture before you do it."

We bought a few watches and handbags but the quality isn't as good as dubai! The food in the evening out in the square wasn't special. He gave us extra food even though we didn't request it and still charged us. We ended up paying 200dh for two kebabs,two chips and a bit of salad, so you know we truley got ripped off.The first day we got there i didn't like it at all and was quite scared as beggers would follow and watch you get cash from the ATM machine. after a few trips to the market i soon got use to it. We only got lost there once. You definatley need a good sense of direction as its like one big maze!! Overall, just be careful with your handbag and belongings and always haggle down to atleast a third of their original price, if you even pretend to walk out if they don't give you the price they want, it always works. They end up calling you back into the shop."

We walked into the square when we first arrived and had a drink at Cafe De'France to take it all in. At night time the square comes alive with performers, street food and market sellers. We ate at No.15 and No.25 - both were good, No.25 being better but more expensive. Dinner is around 200dirhams which includes bread,olives, water, and a great selection of moroccan dishes. Be weary of the snake charmers and locals who try to approach you with Atlas monkeys. My boyfriend just responded to a hello from one local and before he knew it, had a monkey on his shoulders!!"

Though not having the luxury of a sit down restaurant, there's several stalls to choose from and there's lots of variety. The cous cous and kebab dishes were great. I was concerned that we may get ill from eating here, but didn't at all. The atmosphere is great and some of the best food on our trip was eaten here at a very low price. It's ideal to eat here, enjoy the entertainment on the square and then head off for cocktails."

Probably you will feel like playing in a movie or you are back 20-30 years. It's a life time experience and worth the visit 100%. After finish looking around you can take a car with horses (we pay 50drm. each) and drive us to Bahia Palace.

You need to go into this knowing what to expect and mentally prepare yourself... otherwise you will probably not have a good experience. Expect people to ask for change constantly... and when you give it to them they will probably keep asking for more. And expect everyone except the food vendors to ask at least 10 times what something is worth. I didn't bother to barter with the food vendors... but I did with everything else. An example of the way the performers do business is the snake charmers. We stopped to look at them, because I know a little about snakes and wanted to see what they had. They had puff adders and Cobras (probably Egyptian cobras), lizards and a hawk and were playing a little horn. We were immediately given a warm welcome and I had a (non-venomous) snake tossed around my neck, and the guy took pictures of us, and everything seemed fine, with him taking pictures of us. Then he pressed the snake's head against me and my traveling companion wishing us wealth and a happy life etc... after about two minutes of hanging out with us, the guy said \"how about you give me 300 Dirham for this experience\"... to which I replied with absolute awe followed by a hearty laugh and a \"What now?\" He was asking for over $35 for spending two minutes with us. I offered him 40 (which in retrospect was more than I should have paid)... which he told me was \"nothing\" and he wanted 300. I told him he could have the 40 and he said \"No\". So I started to walk away, then he grabbed the 40 out of my hand and looked at me with disgust as he walked off. The same thing will happen with everything... if you take a picture of the snakes, or monkeys, or even someone painting Henna on another tourist... expect them to ask for a ridiculous amount of money \"for the picture\" or \"the experience\". Expect people to physically step into your path of travel, and try to herd you into their shop... maybe even grabbing you by the hand and pulling you in. Expect people to non-stop jump in front of you and tell you they have the best restaurant or food stall and try to seat you. That's pretty much all the bad...The good... this place really is an \"experience\". I think it's incredible... although I wouldn't want to spend more than a couple hours in the square in a stretch even if I were sitting at a foodstall and eating during that time. The \"wild west\" atmosphere really wears you down... but you can get fairly good deals on things... usually better from the people without stores who just have their wares spread out on blankets. If you see something you would like think how much would I pay for that at home (do a quick money conversion in your head 10 to 1 for Euro or 8.5 to 1 for US Dollars) then offer them about a quarter what you would pay at home. They might laugh, one of them even told me \"go get some sleep you're obviously tired... this is good quality\" but you come up a little, get to just under half what you would pay for it at home and then say \"No? Ok... then I can't afford it. Sorry we can't do business.\" Then walk out of the store. If you don't leave the store before they accept your offer, you aren't getting a good price. The food vendors are all pretty good, especially the guys with dried fruit and nuts. Those are incredible!So prepare yourself mentally and venture off into the square for an hour or two at a time, taking breaks in restaurants or ice cream parlors along the outside of the square. It really is a neat, albeit tiring experience!"

This had made me feel stressed and nervous at first and had made me want to leave the city as soon as possible. However, on finally reaching the Jemaa el Fna, my stress had turned to amazement and joy. This square is so full of life, with various local North African cultures gathering in the square almost 24 hours a day to sell their goods. The colours, lights, smells, etc. are all a joy to investigate. The people are also very friendly. Should you want to escape the square for a bit, there are plenty of restaurants around the square to choose from and to look out over the amazing atmosphere of the square. This is particularly great when the prayer calls are coming from the mosques surrounding the Jemaa al Fna.

Our next best choice is No.1 for regular vegetable and meat tagines - just as good this year in 2013 as it was in 2011 when we were last there."

Keep your eyes straight ahead and do not show even the slightest interest in the baby animals, the snakes, the henna tattoo designs or the barbary apes, or you will have some very unfriendly, unwelcoming people demanding your money very quickly - and making you feel like you should part with even more of it. You're better to get a few coins and go join in listening to one of the story-tellers, musician groups or actors, even if you can't understand Arabic. Don't get me wrong - you'll still be expected to hand over a few Dirham, but at least you're getting entertainment that nobody else is suffering for (although there can be a degree of racism in some of the acting out, I think). Also, unless you *know* you want to eat, don't bother walking anywhere near the food stalls because you will just get unnecessary hassle. Watch out for the little kids trying to sell you tissues, too - they'll have their hands in your pockets very quickly.It's a great place and you can tell it's oozing with history, but sadly the pressures of poverty combined with the influx of tourism have made this place somewhere you have to be aware of, *beware* of and be wary of all at once."

It seems people are a bit more liberal at night, as there were fewer jalabas, more PDA, dress codes a bit looser. Wander around and then have dinner at one of the many outdoors restaurants on the second or third floors of the surrounding buildings - the square is great evening entertainment!

In the shops, you can experience considerable bargaining. Prices are quoted much high for the things. But you can easily spend hours and hours in this chaos and still have fun. We went there twice, but still felt was not enough. Also, in the main entrance you will find horse carriages which you can hire for a trip around the city, which is a good experience.

The square was always buzzing with performers, vendors, food and drink. The square is surrounded with rooftop restaurants and has several entrances to the souks. There are many street performers and if you stop to watch, you should tip. You will be expected to tip if you take a picture or film. I never had a problem with any of the performers but had heard they can be aggressive. Aside from the typical 3rd-world attempts to get you to watch or participate, I found everyone quite pleasant. Many travelers are lured by the aggressive invitations, participate or watch the show, then expect to just walk away. These performers and entertainers are providing a service. If you partake in the service, expect to pay. If you do not want to pay, do not participate or watch from a distance. Nothing is free in Marakkech. Things to look for: OMG check out the tooth-puller! He will have a small table with a blue tablecloth. He will have a huge basket of human teeth and several dental instruments. With sugary dates beings a Moroccan mainstay, rotten teeth were and are quite common. The tooth puller will yank out those baddies right in the square! Snake charmers - they are everywhere but I do not recommend you support their business as the poor animals are exploited and often treated poorly. I've seen these same tricks in India, Central America and Mexico.Belly Dancers! Remember, the Islamic religion requires women to cover everything and abhors the woman who draws sexual attention to herself - as such - look closely at the veiled belly dancers flirting with the men in the crowd and flitting around... awfully tall for women...and not very curvy...why don't they ever say a word? See if you can figure out their secret!Henna: Meh. I don't trust these Henna formulas in the square - you never know what you are going to get and I have heard horror stories about allergic reactions. If you are near the beginning of your trip, it's not worth the risk IMHO. Monkey Men: Do NOT walk close to the men with monkeys on a leash. They will grab you and put the monkey on you. If your companions laugh and snap a picture, you will be expected to pay. Aside from being blind-sided by a monkey, I don't like being hustled into tipping. Also, I feel this is an exploitation of animals who belong in the wild BUT to each their own! Orange Juice!!! I was skeptical about eating/drinking in the square but finally took the plunge and bought the AMAZING orange juice. It was delicious, sweet and I could have drank gallons of it. Don't miss it!!!***Culturally speaking, Moroccans do not like their picture taken without asking and expect a tip if you take a picture of them or their shops/products/performance. If you want to take someone's picture, just ask and give them a few dirhams. Sometimes they will say no - but I never had a bad experience when I was polite enough to ask.***"

Needless to say we were a little worried about going to a culturally diverse country as two young girls, but we had little to no trouble at all. You have to realise that the people in this country are significantly poorer than anyone in England or Europe. For some of them, begging is a way of life. If you show interest in someone's Souq, then they will come out and try to encourage you to come in. Sometimes you'll even be approached and asked for money. Don't be fooled though, the people of Marrakech are very friendly, they aren't violent or rude. If you don't want to go inside of their shop, give them money, have a henna tattoo from one of the women or buy something, then just shake your head, give a little wave of the hand and firmly say no. It's as simple as that. If you find people trying to tell you which way you need to go to get to the square or museum or what have you, then just ignore them. They won't send you the wrong way, but they may ask you for money. This is a wonderful place full of wonderful and funny people. Things I'd advise not missing are: the Moroccan mint tea, a tagine or two, the museums, and a traditional Hammam spa (I went to Le Bain Bleu and had the time of my life). This was more of a response to negative reviews, but if you do your research and go with an open mind, Marrakech will be a trip you'll never forget."

More commercialized than its old medina counterpart, the bright sun filled plaza beside a mosque provides visitors with full ambiance of french - moroccan tourist culture. The plaza is filled with fruit and spice stalls, locals with monkeys and snakes that they offer tourists to take pictures with for a small fee and a mixed plethora of entertainers such as magicians and story tellers and bystanders. The aura of the place is so rich in its culture and diversity that one will notice peddlers selling carriage rides or toys being able to speak at least 11 different languages to the basic degree. the liveliness and bustle of the place is turned into solemnity during their calls for prayers which happens 5 times a day. A completely different experience and culturally enriching adventure. Anyone who calls themselves worldly must simply experience something like this at least once in their lives."

We last visited Marrakech 17 years ago and were magnetically drawn to the attractions on offer in the main square: acrobatists, fire-eaters, snake charmers, soothsayers, mock dentists pretending to extract teeth etc. However, the magic has vanished and all that remains, in the day, are several rows of juice sellers, a few women applying henna and at night there are the endless rows of food stalls.Marrakech's main attraction has disappeared and the square is virtually empty; it's very sad!"

There are locals selling their merchandise also, for example the orange juice stalls and nut stalls in the place itself. Unfortunately we did not see the acrobats and snake tamers of which we were told about but Im sure they will be there some of the time. The best are the night markets when the Place becomes of full of life and light. Food stalls are set up at night and everyone is merry and filling their bellies! We experienced this on a sunday evening which was even better as on Sunday many locals have a day off so the place is extra busy! I suggest though if you dont like crowds perhaps go to the night market in the week - if they are on then, please do check!"

I liked it early morning as it was far less crowded, but it is a spectacular place to watch the sun go done and very lively after dark. There are one or two reasonable places to eat in and around the Square, but many are best really just for a drink.Some of the entertainment is really quite good and there is a strong police presence virtually at all times, so much more relaxed and safer than the rest of the Medina. the acrobats we saw were truly spectacular. We saw so many mixed reviews about whether to eat the food in the square that we in the end decided to be cautious and gave it a miss. Pity because it smelt delicious.Animal lovers may find the Square a little hard to take - monkeys on chains yanked about, Cobra snakes ( milked of venom) slapped repeatedly to perform basic tricks, dozens if not hundreds of stray cats which look like they are starving, donkeys and carts abound but sadly some (more than one!) donkeys were lame. We saw one moving across the square with a lame back leg, literally sliding it's stiff back leg across the floor and being beaten savagely. The Square would not only survive but in my opinion it would thrive without all this nonsense.Truly felt like a trip back in time, and on the whole though it is flawed I liked it."

Love it or hate it, you will inevitably find yourself returning again and again to the heart of all the action in the wonderfully crazy and addictive city of Marrakech. Architecturally, it's nothing at all really (and it's not even a square by most people's definition; just a rather formless and tatty space, fringed by a series of not overly impressive cafes, whose main recommendation is that their roof terraces provide a sort of grandstand viewing point for the action going on below). By day, there are stalls selling orange juice, dried fruits and nuts; itinerant water sellers; groups of young macho acrobats and of course, the obligatory snake charmers and monkey handlers. By night... the transformation is extraordinary. Dozens of stalls appear, complete with bench seating and lighting, where a weird and wonderful variety of culinary delights can be had. You may well pass on the whole sheep's heads - but they are evidently pretty popular with the locals. Less worryingly, all the usual Moroccan stand-bys, such as tagines and kebabs, can be had, and for a fraction of the price you'll pay in less temporary eating places. It's said that eating off paper, rather than the many-times washed plates, using limited water supplies, is a safer bet, but that's your call. Expect some serious hustling here, as rival stall-holders vie for your custom, but don't miss out on the opportunity to be part of possibly the world's greatest open-air dining show."

I will advise to be wary of the orange juice sold on the square - it is watered down with tap water which isn't suitable for drinking - my boyfriend had a terrible upset stomach from this. Stick to bottled water, and ladies be careful of the 'henna ladies' who come across quite aggressive and will grab your hand and start drawing on it without your consent and then demand money. So keep your hands close to you and firmly tell them 'no' they will soon disappear. Remember it is polite to tip whoever you are photographing as Marrakechi's tend to be dubious of having their image taken (stolen) and please please please remember to dress appropriately - the occasional tourist walking through te square in hot pants and vest top is actually quite offensive."

We had a guy shove a monkey on my arm and being dumb we each took a photo of ourselves with the monkey - the monkey didn't look happy out the setup one bit but that's another subject - then I was taken under his umbrella where he asked for about 800dirhams, I know it's not huge amounts but I gave him what I could, he wasn't happy but then he came to us with the monkey not the other ways round.We found the spices area of the maze and had a good talk with a helpful salesman who then proceeded to sell us some great spices which we still have in our kitchen and use regularly. Prices are acceptable but if not you have to haggle, it's the number one place in the world to haggle so get used to it.One thing I will you of though is the roads, if you are going to cross them make sure you look, look and look again...and then wait because you've probably missed a car or bike that will most certainly knock on your behind....it's madness.Amazing honeymoon, would love to go back."

I had been told there were pretty restaurants and cafes surrounding a lovely square. It's not pretty. It's a giant slab of concrete surrounded by far from picturesque buildings. On arrival I saw a chap sitting with a few snakes including a cobra. I love snakes and asked if he would mind if I took some photos. He then put one around my neck- great, and of course we planned to give him some money. But he demanded 300 dirhams, and we were quickly surrounded by 3 of his colleagues all shouting \"you give us 300 dirhams for our family.\" We gave him 50 dirhams- pretty generous for a few photos- and they continued to shout at us and insult us as we walked away. A few steps further and a very old woman grabbed my hand. And held it so tightly that I couldn't break free. A younger woman came up and quickly started to put henna on my left hand- with me saying \"no\" and still trying to break away. I realised that the hand she was pulling was the hand with my wedding and engagement ring on- and it was the rings that they were trying to remove. I got away, rings still on my finger.....but they were still shouting and demanding money, for the henna I didn't want.  This all happened in broad daylight- not in the evening.  I will be writing other reports about our stay in Marrakech in the next few days- sadly most of them bad experiences.  I would add that I have lived in both Yemen and Egypt, so am very used to Arab culture. But I have never experienced violence like this, anywhere. Very, very disappointing."

However, in the square (and surroundings) they can be verging on aggressive. The henna girls will grab the ladies hand and attempt to draw on it without permission, all the others will demand money instantly for anything. We stopped to look at what a crowd was watching, we couldnt see as the crowd of 50 or so people obscured what turned out to be a small traditonal band, we stopped walking for less than 20 seconds and suddenly we have hostile demands for money, we walked away and was followed with repeated demands. The food stalls are similar, very hostile sales techniques.

It's a shame that you don't end up seeing much because if you make any eye contact they pounce so you end up walking with your head down. I'm glad I have been but I won't be returning. I would recommend going to the Cooperative markets, you get the real deal, don't get hassled and you can appreciate the work that goes into the pieces because they encourage you to touch and look. If you survive not being hit by a moped you may be finished off by a respiratory illness from the pollution."

This is Marrakech's answer to Times Square at New Years, except that it is all day, every day.The square is central to most attractions in Marrakech. It is inside the medina close to the Koutoubia mosque and is the entry point into the souks. You will probably start and end each day in Marrakech right here."

Its a must to go to Jemaa el Fna in the day and the night just to see how very different the square is.By day, there are the snake charmers, monkeys, birds of pray, dancers and 'doctors'. By night, there is a total transformation as by 5pm - the entertainers make way for the night food stalls. It's a real spectacular and an absolute blast! Word to the wise when eating in the evening from one of the stands - don't be pushed into eating somewhere when you haven't quite made up your mind. Just tell the vendor that you' have just eaten' or' it's too early to eat', and they will back off. We had some delicious food there - but got food poisoning at 'HASSAN' stand one evening."

We were staying nearby, so it was easy to pop in and out. First thing in the morning the square was all but empty, and was nice to walk around. It quickly filled up, and lots of the stallkeepers were friendly and welcoming. As the day wore on, we were in and out, and the touts became more and more insistent, to the point of being beyond pleasant banter to downright aggressive. There are several restaurants around the square, and if you can stake out a table, seeing it all from above is a treat. As the day draws in, the food vendors appear as by magic, and you're set for an evening treat - food is plentiful and interesting, and you'll be happy to be there. The caleches are stationed on one side, and around the edges. They are apparently regulated, but we were a bit dismayed by the condition of some of the horses. You'll see snake charmers, and don't fall victim to the monkey you may suddenly find in your arms. I felt badly for the hawks tied down to entice tourists, but it's never all that helpful to judge different cultures by your own standards. Go and enjoy, you'll likely only do this once in your life!"

It doesn't matter how many people (we were a family of 4) or how many photos (we took a couple each). Although, I think if you are a large group it only stands to reason to pay more. When we were with our guide we were not harassed for more money for this, but when alone the water sellers tried to get us to pay more.

We first visited in the evening of our first night, we didn't really know where we were going and just ended up strolling around to get the feel of the city, around 9pm it was still full of life, with lots of makeshift stalls set up mostly all selling food and tea. The men running the stalls were very pushy, at one point literally trying to drag my boyfriend to come and buy some of his food, aside from that they were all very friendly and eager to chat to us, when they realised we were English they started doing their best cockney accents and one man took a particular shine to us and we ended up having dinner with him at stall while he talked about his life and so on and we managed to pick up some interesting information on the city and about how the people there feel about tourism and so on. During the day it had a relentless energy, the outskirts of the market was full of performers, musicians, henna artists and men with animals. One lesson we learnt too late was if a man puts a monkey on your shoulder, when you take a photo... he will expect money! And rather a lot, in the market place you need to haggle for everything. As you walk into the main marketplace it's a seemingly endless maze, a covered narrow walkway teeming with stalls and people all trying to sell you more than you could ever need, its a wondrous labyrinth of treasures and trinkets. It would seem easy to get lost but after a while you start you recognise particular areas within the market, distinctive stalls or indeed stall holders!Hustle and bustle doesn't quite cover it! It's constant, the stall holders will all try and entice you and there's so much to see and buy, the atmosphere is incredible but you'll be relieved to be back in the calm of your hotel room. It's an absolute must see without fail. My advice however is be prepared to be hassled, ensure you haggle for everything and don't be afraid to be firm with the stallholders and occasional beggars. The restaurants on the outskirts are a wonderful place to sit and relax with a tagine and some tea and just observe the energy and atmosphere."

Although you have to come here on a trip to Marrakech to see the bustle of daily life, it seems that what was once a central meeting point has no become really touristy. There is nothing romantic about the entertainment and particularly the snake charmers here, it is just low quality attempts to make money from tourists. It saddened me to see western tourist encouraging the poor treatment of monkeys and snakes by paying money for photos. It is still a fascinating place to see life going on, but in a very different way to what we were expecting."

We went in and bartered (very badly) for some shoes and scarves. Having spent all our money, we decided to call it a day and return to the hotel. However, we got lost. Not your usual kind of lost. 3 hours later, we were still lost. And being followed by a local chap who kept demanding money to show us the way out of the medina. We were being hassled, left, right and centre to buy things, but when we asked for directions, they wouldn't tell us where to go without payment, if we kept asking they refused to speak English. We later found out that the locals don't like to barter with women, and that we would have been hassled less if we had travelled with a man. I've travelled to lots of places, and been hassled for money lots of times before, but nothing prepared me for the intensity of it here.We were hassled very aggresivly by some of the guys in the square, who came up and put snakes on us then started demanding money from us (grabbing at us, squaring up to us etc). It was very scary and intimidating. I don't think I would go back unless I was with a man, it's just too intensive and ruins the experience.You will be asked for money if you take a picture of anything or any one. If you ask someone a question or for directions, they will ask you for money. On the plus side, we had some nice fresh orange juice, it was great to experience some real Morrocan culture and meet people. I've given this attraction 3 points out of 5, as if you travel with a man, and are quite strong willed - you may survive and enjoy the experience! Just be prepared!"

You will be expected to pay to watch any of the street entertainment ( nothing in life is free) so make sure you have coins. There are snake charmers and monkeys on chains; there are belly dancers and children and women boxing (!). Storytellers attract large crowds of Marrakshi people, as do the musicians, dancers and acrobats. There are food stalls galore in the evenings, where you can eat all the normal offerings ( kebabs, olives, bread, tagine) or you can try other delicacies including various offal and snails. Freshly squeezed orange juice is cheap and delicious. Watch out for the henna ladies - they will paint you a tattoo before you have a chance to say no.

If you go here with a handbag or wallet in your back pocket then unfortunately as a serving police officer I would say your we're asking for trouble! I advise to use a money belt and to only keep about 150 dirham in tight pockets ect for when buying from souks etc (it makes it easier when bargaining if they think you only have a small amount of money)When you go in the day it's worth only having loose change or 20dirham note to hand out of the money belt! IF you want a photo with a monkey or a snake (personally I did!) let them do their tactics and approach you!!! Once you've got your pics ect and get told 400dirham just pull the 20dirham and say its all you have on you. I paid 20dirham for my partner and myself to have 12 pics with a monkey in total, worth it for memories! Again at night food market, just go with you gut or more sensibly look for places with English menus and plenty of locals eating at the stalls! The lambs brain just tastes like lamb fat, the tongue is gross though in my opinion."

He tried to charge me 50 euros! Things like that are a joke. One gets sick of the utter disrespect they have for tourists.Avoid those street performers where you can, avoid making eye contact with them.Other than that, there are amazing food stalls both day and especially at night. Also take the opportunity to have some fresh orange juice from the stands - be sure to use a straw, as the glasses don't get washed often.Take the time to just immerse yourself and zone out all the hagglers and the annoying shopkeepers.

Stall number 81 we ate at was really nice and also the soup stall just opposite it. Enjoy a glass of orange juice for 4 DH when its hot during the day. very refreshing, use a straw. As with anywhere, be vigilate. I did see at least one person get pick pocketed by some young children. Keep your wallet in a buttoned down / zipped pocket.

We definitely got what we asked for and we had a great time.The square is filled with a variety of people trying to make money in a variety of ways - snake charming, henna tattoos, selling orange juice, using monkeys etc. We had an old guy follow us trying to be our \"guide\" at one point - please do not fall for this unless you are prepared to pay for being shown around (they aren't just being friendly because they just want to help you!)One thing we were unimpressed with was the animals as we felt the way they were treated was cruel - monkeys in nappies and leads, snakes slithering everywhere and being pulled back to the rug they are supposed to be on or put in tiny boxes, horse and carts standing all day long in the heat. This part of the Marrakech way of life was quite upsetting but unfortunately there was not much we could do about this, as much as we would have liked to!Many people will try and lure you over to them and then do things such as place a funny hat on your head, try to start drawing a henna tattoo on you, place a monkey on your shoulder, place a snake round your neck etc then demand money. We found it best to avoid hassle and demands for money by taking a wide berth and not making eye contact. We managed to enjoy ourselves and see everything from a bit further away and not get hassled.I enjoyed the square by day but enjoyed it even more by night when the place fills with food stalls serving all kinds of food, from quite normal dishes to the more weird and wonderful (or sometimes just weird!)If you are visiting Marrakech you cannot miss a visit at least once to the Jemaa el Fna.

It may very well have been us and not Jemaa el Fna, but we were very disappointed. We didn't see a single snake charmer or man-with-monkey, but we did find plenty of people wanting to sell things to us. We wandered through the fruit stalls and then through the small eateries, but after the 4th or 5th high-pressure salesman tried everything short of physical force to get us to eat at his stand, we decided to head back to the riad and relax.

My advice would be to go there expecting it to be crazy and busy and full of people trying to hassle you and you'll be pleasantly surprised that it's not so bad after all.

But eating at the food stalls in the evening is an experience not to be missed. We ate some good fish and very tasty fried aubergine at stall no. 81. The waiters were entertaining. It was cheap. The sweet sellers walked by upmteen times and we kept saying 'later'. We then managed to escape before buying their sweets, and found them 10 Dirhams cheaper on a stall on the outskirts of the food stalls. A scary 'Henna' lady tried to grab my sister's hand but I dragged my sister away. You have to be careful as cheap henna can cause burns or allergic reactions. But it was all part of the mad experience of the square. I'm now wishing I'd accepted the offer of a thousand Ferraris for my sister!!"

The edges of the sqaure have souks and shops selling the same goods (slippers, lanterns etc) as deep inside the souks, but at even more inflated prices. The rest is food stalls and rows and rows of juice stalls. There are people entertaining, but mainly snake charmers and men with monkeys on chains so you can get your picture taken with them. Not keen on this sort of animal cruelty myself, not atmospheric and basically a bit behind the times! The henna painters are very persistant and grab your hands as you go past. A friend had hers done, and it looked like a 5 year old had done it! I normally like this sort of chaotic scene, but really it is just overrated and touristy, and lacks authentic atmosphere. Go once, just to say you've been."

If that wasn't bad enough on our way out I got a monkey put on the shoulder by a monkey charmer, which at first I enjoyed, then another monkey on the other shoulder, again no problem. They encouraged my wife to take photos. After they demanded 200 DH per monkey, 400 DH in total! Con artists!We had a talk about this after and decided we'd give it another go. Enjoyable this time!After coming out the souks we had a wonder around the square.There are various stalls selling souvenirs etc.The snake charmers have got to be the bravest men I know, there is no way I'd get that close to a king cobra! They're amazing to watch those!They had dancers in the square which was traditional, music men and various other entertainments.We stopped to have a refreshing glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, only 4 DH each."

Depending on time of day there are differnent things too see: awaking at 9am in the morning you'll find taxis, donkey carts, horse-drawn carriage and motorcycles. Later people apears with apes, dressing like babys. Beware of them: faster as you can say \"NO\" the ape is on your shoulder and the man claims money to get it away. The same for the snake charmers. Both species are first nice, invite you to come closer and take a photo. Later they claim high fees (10\u20ac for photo of a snake) and become really loud, agressive and touched me/my camera as I didn't pay. Beware, or use a zoom objective ;)The henna-women also are very intrusively, if you don't be fast they start painting your hand before you stop walking. Men in shops close to the La Place are also brash to get you in their shops, prices there are higher then deeper in the souk and they become agressive or unfriendly if you don't buy. Bad behaviour, as single woman I lied, told I was married but that won't keep them away from insulting sentences and touches. In the afternoon they start to build up the food stalls day by day. Taste the local cuisine there. No matter which time, it is always interesting to see the people and listen to different music groups there. Best place to do this are the restaurant terrasses around the place, save from everybody be friendly first and claim money therefore in the end."

The stalls were set up in attractive manner, the entertainers approached without being obnoxious. The snake charmers got a little angry when people photographed without giving them a gratuity but you have to remember they are doing the show to make a living. The fresh orange juice stands had the best juice I'ver ever tasted and I live in Florida! We ate from the food stalls at night and thoroughly enjoyed it - especially the one with the fried fish and eggplant. We stood by a few minutes watching in confusion until the cook found us a place to sit and started putting food in front of us - delicious. Many locals eating there and they were all friendly. For a few local dollars a great meal and evening of entertainment. Don't miss it!"

This is also where you can get a local tour guide (horse and carriage), though remember haggle the price before getting into the carriage. Marakech is a family friendly destination - they seem to prefer families traveling together. We were treated very well by everyone we met and often people would go out of their way to make our daughter comfortable. Of course it was for a better price but when you are so far out of your element it's the little bits that make you feel at ease.

The Jemaa el Fna is the open market part of the old Medina in Marrakech and the stalls all have hawkers that can be extremely agressive to the point that one phycially slapped our son for going to a competting eating group.During the day, there are the typical citrus juice, date, and spice stands along with the snake charmers (with half dead snakes) and monkey handlers. They will approach you and place the monkey or snake on your shoulder and expect a tip for a picture. A simple no will not prevent this, but shift to a command voice seems to stop them in their track (think drill sargent). The shops that surrond this open market square sell very high priced junk (sic fake labels, poor qualify, excessive prices). For an example, for a poor quality scarf we were given for free on a tour, they were priced at 20 DAR but further into the madina/souk, they were only 10 DAR and negitiable from there down. There are varsiou restaurants / cafe's around the markter as well, with the furtherst one overlooking the court yard fit only for the view and drink (i.e. tea with mint leaves). There is a recommended restaurant 2 doors down from this cafe that has excellent food and value and a reasonable view as well - however, this restaurant is great for lunch, but close early for diner.Durning the night, the intensity intensifies as the food stalls really get going from 6 PM - midnight. There are sooo many food stall and the hawkers get even more agressive, essentially grabbing you or standing in your face. In this case even a command voice seems lost in the free-for-all. We compared the food prices and fond that the restaurants were either targeting the 'white' tourists, including some going so far as to hang fake Trip Advisor #1 signs from the roofs of their stalls. Comparing the prices, clearly these 'tourist traps' were hightly over priced. We opted to start with the snails on the far end (would only serve us the 10 DAR size serving, not the 5 DAR serving also listed); then submitted our selves to the accosting of the various hawkers (hey - I sort of like this 'sport' while others in my group clerarly did not) and found a grill place that was occupied by 'locals' (i.e. not a lot of white faced, white/blond haired people). They were able to find a place for us and the ordering was fast and furrious. Some locals helped identify which foods to avoid (i.e. veg tangine, minced meat only partially cooked, etc.). Finished up with ginger cake and tea then off to the closest cafe near where the horse carrages que-up for a tea with mint leaves to observe the chaios from afar (an take pictures with the telephoto without having to pay).Everone should experience this once in their life time . . but for us, it was poor due to the phycal assault on our youngest son."

Then, not long after you have absorbed this daytime scene, it changes. Carts are pulled in by hand, loaded with battered sinks, stools, tables, elaborate teapots, large snail cooking pots, boxes of ingredients and a collection of well battered equipment. Within an hour, the square is transformed into a food market. We walked around surveying the scene before settling on the stall right opposite the Cafe Glacier. It was really good value and certainly good enough for the price."

The Riad we stayed at was just off the streets of the square, a peaceful haven to run to after the madness!Street sellers start opening early, in the morning some of the market is open along with some exhibitioners such as snake charming, monkeys and horse & carriages. We were dumped just outside the square by the taxi when we arrived in the evening and taken through the square with our luggage carried by a man with a barrow, we fought our way through the crowded madness of the square packed with people, motorbikes and cars. Very overwhelming, especially after carting our stuff down side streets!We ventured out into the square that evening and coming from the Midlands UK it was a shock to the senses. Fascinating though!The food stalls will try every trick to get you to eat there, we had songs sung at us, were crowded around having menus thrust at us and they even got other customers to clap to get us in. The food wasn't great though and be warned about various dishes being placed in front of you that you didn't ask for, you will be expected to pay for them.Watch out for the henna artists, they will come up and seem pleasant but after a minute they will grab your hand and try to ink you. Be extremely firm and say no, I felt rude but after the top of my hand being covered in ink twice and it now being indelibly attached to my clothing it's necessary. Everything has a price, ask for directions and you will generally have someone lead you to a location but expect compensation, not a problem but be prepared.The stalls are repetitive but bargains can be had, especially with leather, bags and spices. Be prepared to barter, more fool you if you take the first price as the seller will always go lower, such is the location and the culture. but know there is a lowest price so don't be insulting. Be sure of a price you want to pay and don't exceed it no matter how much you like it as you will likely be the loser. The sellers are willing to barter with anyone and will try any trick, like the food sellers, to get you in there.. Such as saying everything is 20dhms, when this isn't true, ask for the price of everything.My biggest issue is the lack of ability to browse, items are thrust into your hand or you are directed to certain products and you can either miss things you really like or leave in annoyance.Firmness is key, if you are being harrassed too much just go down a few stalls and you will find the same item without the hassle where you can purchase what you want (also a good tip for bartering, find out a price at one stall and you can use that to negotiate a better deal elsewhere).After crossing the square many, many times over the space of 8 days it does get a little intense but it is definitely worth visiting.We took a horse and carriage ride one evening, they have a tarriff and we arranged for a 30 min journey for 6 people for 400dhm, in my view worth the money, the driver was very friendly and took us on a very pleasant route through several areas taking over the allotted time and taking pictures of us on the carriage at the end.Seriously mad place, everything and anything has a price, if you stop to look at any display expect them to approach, and expect them to want payment. Pictures are not free so be warned as there is so much to see:) "

Ate at a few nicer restaurants as well (including Azar) but the quality and taste were just so much better at the stalls that we ended up eating there most of the trip.Few tips -1. Eat at stall #1: We tried a few others and none matched either in price or in taste.2. Avoid stall #31: They are extremely disorganized. Tried to charge us more than what we owed, put extra food in front of us (olives, potato fritters etc.) when not ordered and charged us for them at the end. Plus the food took forever to get to us, was cold when it arrived and tasted below average.3. You have to pay approximately 5Dhr for the bread and sauces that are placed in front of you as soon as you sit down. Some (like #31, charge 10Dhr) so remember to ask if what is \"given\" to you is free..same story with anything else just put in front of you. You can also ask for half of the bread if you like4. Ask for the spicy sauce - delicious5. Mint tea at the end of the meal is usually free..and refreshing 6. A 10% tip is typically expected/appreciated"

After a while i just looked at the ground the entire time, but then I got even more verbal abuse.When you walk past the eateries in the evening, they pull your clothes and force you to sit down and eat there. I got forced into one of them. Got diarrhea after 10 minutes. Asked somebody directions to the nearest toilets. They're in the back of the square behind some bushes. It's a toilet where you use your hand and a bucket of water. So beware if you have an explosive digestive tract.I enjoyed buying a glass of orange juice on the square during the daytime. It's a bit more relaxed then. I was just minding my business when some guy with a monkey came over and pushed the monkey in my arms. That meant I had to pay for the experience.It's not like i was some halfnaked chubby American lady staring at stalls for ages without buying anything.. I would walk at a normal pace and lay my eyes on some tourist tat 100 meters away. ( Because I did really want to buy something, I just didn't want to be hassled) The sellers would catch my eye and then start their usual chat, then if I would say no in a friendly way, they would start getting aggressive and personal. \" Why aren't you buying this, isn't it good enough for you? What's wrong with you?\"Marrakechians are so aggressive to tourists, I don't understand why anyone still wants to go there. There are far more interesting places in Morocco than that overcrowded tourist-trap. I hope tourists stop coming there, and they learn how to treat people."

Sure, we were beginners but in the end we paid more than for a dinner at a topnotch restaurant such as Kosybar or Gossip. The bill was a shock and there was nothing we could do about it.Soo, if you are eating in Djemaa, watch out! When ordering pay attention to exactly every little thing you order and agree about the price before they start to cook. Even if you do that its actually not very cheap nor good. Every part of your meal is from 5-15 Dirham so of you want to be satisfied maybe you'll order 4 skewers, a piece of bread, some salad, couscous and some fried veggies. For this you pay about 70-80 Dihram. You'll get a better meal from one of the many restaurants around the square for less money."

Aggressive madness. I really did not enjoy myself.I consider myself well travelled&was prepared for hassling/haggling with shop keepers etc but this was another level! Everyone is out for your money, even the school kids are out to get you. They want money for saying hello. Strolling in the Medina was too much hassle to enjoy. The scenery is stunning&the atmosphere is exciting, but it just could not be enjoyed. You cant stop, take a photo, look around&soak it in without someone approaching you&trying to lead you off to their shop/restaurant. This would be fine if I couldve simply smiled&said no thanks, but this won't do! I got verbally abused constantly.Even when you agree a fee with a taxi drivr before geting into the cab, as soon as they close the door they'll turn around&up the price. The cabbies will ask for 150mad from airport to medina. There is a bus no. 19 for 30 mad which does the same trip. I managed to get a taxi gueliz to medina for 25mad, but theyll try&charge 50mad+. I got a cab from medina back to airport for 60mad, despite it was agreed 50mad, but i just couldnt wait to get back on a plane home so whateves.In tourist attractions-museums, saadian tombs etc i found some tourists who just didnt want to leave as these were the only places they werent hassled. I like to visit places&take them in, enjoy the experience, but I never felt relaxed. I tried friendly banter, simple no thanks la shukaran in arabic&quiet treatment-all met with the same aggressive abuse&begging for money for simply looking at something.Also i paid to visit a berber village in the atlas mountains which turned out to be ladies dressed in lab coats waiting to sit you down&fob off the millions on various argan oil products. A trip to the atlas mountains (which are absolutely stunning) could not be enjoyed as first stop was a 'local'restaurant filled with tourists with the choice of 3 diff things on the menu, each costing 120mad!!then being told we had to pay for a guide to walk to the mountains despite already paying for the tour-so double check whats included when you pay for a tour. Our 220mad payment was only for the driver! It's a shame as Ive always wanted to visit Marakech&some of my friends have been&loved it. Unfortunately I did not feel the same."

Price wise similar - they will come after you like mad showing menus and keep telling you to look at the food display (not usually good sign but the freshly made food is normally excellent). Everything is inexpensive anyway so I dined most of my week here... My absolute favourite? Sheeps head and brain (power boiled) I think it was either No. 41 or 44 (you will see the head and brain on display) - got a sample of offal meats with spice pastes for seasoning with free bread and mint tea (and free photo taking) - 30 DH.. Seriously acquired taste but if you are used to offals and freshly made food (and non-vegetarian - you can find excellent veg tagine and sheesh in most other stands). Souks surrounds the square - you can never stop haggling with people. Never accept the first price quoted - always start with 40-35-50% of the price quoted and set yourself an absolute max price you are prepared to pay. Otherwise, walk away - and if sellers very pessistent then another good reason to walk away...Snake charmers, monkeys, musicians playing all day, henna tattoos, etc. I don't know how much more space I have got - but as long as you know the basic rules of not accepting the first price, ignoring the locals trying to speak to you (always end up asking for money afterwards even if they ask where are you going etc unless you absolutely need help - ask the older people less likely to rip you off).Cafe Toubkal on one corner of Djemaa El Fna is an excellent cheap restaurant as an alternative to the food stalls...Overall - this is an absolute must even if you are in Marrakech for a short stay..."

The lead up to the main square is the best bit as this is where we found our travel company (one of many) with who we booked our excursion to Orika Valley. It was only 150 dirhams per person(appox \u00a313) which was great. It is a bit worrying when they want to take you to their shop which is hidden away but don't be scared as they all do this and there shops are normal. It is a very bustley area with lots of people trying to stop you for money or trying to buy there things. There are loads of food place here which may be cheaper than the main square. Once you get to the main square it is very noisy from all the music but there are no snake charmers, belly dancing or monkeys. Its just loads and loads of food stalls and horse and carriages that will take you on a 30min tour of the Madina and surrounding area. There are soukes and stalls when you venture deeper in but we weren't there for shopping and couldn't be bothered to barter so avoided them. We sat down to eat at the busiest food stall in the square as we had read on trip advisor before hand that it was the best one. Biggest mistake in the whole trip. They completely rip you off as they know you are tourists. We didnt want to eat much as we had had a big lunch so we ordered lamb kebabs and sole fish and a bit of salad. However, they bring you out something completely different. They bought us out a mixed kebab plate each and they were tiny yet we were charged 170 dirhams which is like \u00a315 and it wasn't even tasty. We were so annoyed and wish we had never eaten there. The square is really smelly too as there are loads of horses but that could have been dismissed had the place been fun.

The colours, music and families eating, were all part of the show."

We didn't spend much time here during the day, but wandered through frequently at night (the film festival was on, and the huge screen playing free Bollywood movies was a big draw). Eating well here at night probably requires greater artistry than we possessed, particularly at the beginning of our Moroccan trip. We made the mistake of walking - or attempting to walk - right down the main artery of food stalls, and were bombarded from all sides by touts. It finally reached the point where every employee at every stall was applauding us, and a tourist policeman came to calm them all down. It was funny rather than sinister, especially in retrospect, but we didn't have the leisure to choose where we wanted to eat - we just sat, and were served, and the food was pretty average. The showbusiness of it all is worth watching, though. I suspect the food stalls the Moroccans actually eat at, outside all this hullabaloo, are the ones worth trying, but once you're vaguely within the radius of the touristy stalls, it's hard to extract yourself. And the life of the square itself is fascinating."

Sit down at a booth that seems most appetizing, and dig in. The waiters will bring platter after platter of what SEEMS to be free appetizers, but they aren't free. Even aft you order your main dish, they'll keep bring LITTLE TINY plates of bread, veggies, etc, until YOU tell them to stop. EVERYTHING will be on the bill at the end! Don't worry too much though. If you were unable to say NO, the bill will still be quite cheap!!!Snake charmers, medicine men, dancers. . .its all there, AND MORE. This is no circus. . . It's the real thing people! Don't get to close to the snake charmers if you hate snakes! You'll find someone sneak up on you and put a big one around your neck!! Won't take it off until you pay them!! Pay them, though, and get a picture you'll never forget. This is place to put your squeamishness aside, take of your PETA hat off, and throw away your western tendencies of looking away when your food is \"dispatched\"! Dive IN! For Gods sake. . . .dive in!!!! I LOVE that this place exists! Took my wife, and daughter here, and we loved every moment. It takes several trips to Morocco (which we have done) to feel safe here. You ARE quite safe, but its so different, that its hard to be totally comfortable the first few times. . . . But trust me, you are quite safe. Morocco and the USA share the oldest treaty on the planet."

Lots of bare light bulbs strung out higgledy-piggledy, lots of spicy and meat smoke smells and a lot of food smoke. But when we came back the square had been resurfaced in a genteel way, rather like those prefabricated driveways you see advertised in suburban colour supplements, there are rather fewer stalls and the hustlers seemed to be less of a novelty, more sullen and nasty rather than just irritatingly persistent. On our previous visit there had been a few fantastic and authentic feeling French or Arabian cafes around the square, many on first floors with great views and usually three quarters full of locals. This time they were largely sanitised and europeanised with not just English menus and anglophone staff but often a majority of northern European food options. I was still glad to be back but the intense north African culture seemed to be diluted. Still recommended"

Yes, it's crowded & noisy & people are always calling out to you to buy this or that BUT it's so interesting. I never tired of walking through the square. Steer clear of the men with monkeys or else they will try to put one on your shoulder. But as long as you don't get too close, they don't bother you. To me the monkeys did not seem happy, so i couldn't bring myself to contribute to this industry. You will also see snake charmers & woman with henna. I never had anyone get pushy with me. I did get a henna tattoo & asked beforehand if she had brown henna. Only let them use brown, it's more natural & less likely to have filler chemicals. They are many cafes & terraces lining the square. I recomment going onto one of the terraces & taking your Jemaa el Fna pics & video from there. If you do so from within the depths if the square itself someone may want you to pay them if they think they are in your picture. I loved it here, found it fascinating & completely embraced it. You simply cannot go to Marrakech & not go here. And at night too!!! Incredible at night!!!!!! Go go go!!! :)"

We particularly recommend stall #1. Good prices as well! 25MAD (\u00a32) for a tagine! The moroccan cakes are also yummy, very nutty. There are acrobats, snake charmers and men with monkeys on leads. I peraonally don't agree with the monkeys being treated the way they are but is interesting to see.Lots of women offering henna. They can be quite aggressive and will grab your hand and hold the henna syringe close to you. Again, be firm and dont get a 'free flower' done! The souks surround this place so you can also shop around! Have a coffee on a panoramic terrace, the views are amazing! Enjoy the sights. Again, keep your wits about you as there are pickpockets!"

In the daytime there are fruit stalls, monkey handlers, snake charmers, and the odd dancer. At night more locals gather for stories, music, and performers. But the experience of it was overshadowed by the fact that if we showed even the slightest interest in something (and of course we did-- that was the point of our visit!), we'd immediately be approached and asked for money, or have handlers force their monkeys on us. It was unpleasant.On the other hand, I highly recommend situating yourself at a rooftop terrace cafe on the square and watching from afar (with a zoom lens camera!). We had a lovely afternoon people watching over mint tea."

The Square in Marrakech has a huge rep, particularly if you grew up listening to the Stones or Jimi Hendrix or if you think dreads are still acceptable current fashion. Jemaa El Fna is more truthfully a market square, where everything is marked up even higher than the 25% sellers price their wares at in tourist Morocco. There is usually music, or at least some tam-tam, but it isn't very good, to be honest, and the square is dominated by guys abusing monkeys and snake-charmers. It's incredibly noisy, memorably filthy, and every five steps you will be harassed by a vendor or near-flattened by the motorcycles, scooters, taxis and trucks--yes, trucks--which run through the square making up routes as they go. I love Morocco, but the Square, which everyone has to visit once, is a first-timers experience. So if you go, hold on tight to your pocketbook and look for the restos off the square, where the value increases and the health hazards decrease in equal proportion."

Within 30 seconds of stepping into the square, my boyfriend was pulled by the sleeve by some man with a monkey. The monkey climbed on top of my boyfriend's shoulders and the man was demanding that i take a picture of them. We didn't want no photos whatsoever and in trying to get the man to take the monkey away, the monkey scratched my boyfriend's neck and made it bleed in a few places. My boyfriend got absolutely furious and started raising his voice and i threatened the man that i will call the police. He finally took the monkey away and then asked for some money. Needless to say, we didn't give him anything. We walked away and 30 seconds later we were asked by someone if we needed a guide. We walked passed him just saying 'no', so he started insulting us and swearing at us. He called us quite a few nasty words, including racists, which we found absolutely unbelievable. By that time we both were so angry that we just went back out of that place. The next day a nice local man told us to not go there at all because if's full of crazy people and that if for whatever reason we go there, we shouldn't let anyone touch us. Sadly it was too late for this good piece of advise. We will definitely not be going back there ever again if we ever come back to Marrakech."

It was a Thursday night well after dark when we entered the square and we had to walk about 20 mins through the souks and alleys to our Riad. I firstly was very glad I wasn't a lone female and secondly we had arranged for someone to pull our luggage in a cart. The square and alleys are a fascinating and chaotic maze of noise, bright lights then darkness and people. However the electric atmosphere in Jemaa el Fna especially at night time, is not for the faint hearted.Mopeds and bikes come at you from every angle as do the beggars and pick pocketers. The hustlers rudely demand what you want to buy. Jewelery, leather or carpets? The stall owners relentlessly jostle you into buying goods you don't want or need. I thought it was amusing they have cultural signs posted about how rude it is for tourists to take photographs of them without their permission. Fair enough I felt until we came across many young lads who were a big problem to us. With each visit to the square we politely refused their guidance back to the riad and for our politeness we got spat at, sworn at, had footballs kicked at us and lastly fire crackers thrown at us. I think I would settle that a distant photograph being taken was far less rude. The food stalls were amazing and to watch people enjoying the cuisine was great but knowing how much they charge and how they rinse the cutlery was enough to not use them more than once.One day and night would have been long enough as it is a must for the sheer experience. Definitely take your camera, bottled water and a good humour but importantly keep your wits about you!!!"

The nuts/dates stalls are worth a visit although you'll find cheaper in the souks. Careful at the orange stalls as we had heard they top up with dodgy water so make sure you see his preparation. The henna tattoo women should be avoided as we observed several people being accosted by arm. The monkeys - some in nappies - looked sad. Prepare to pay to photograph anything. For a bird's eye view go to any of surrounding cafes overlooking the square and away from the hassle. Night-time is a different story altogether. The celebrations start at nightfall with countless food stalls to accompany the daytime orange/fruit/nut stalls. Plumes of smoke rise from various storytelling ensembles but thankfully the snakes do disappear. If you want to get a close-up of the tribal story-tellers or musicians then be prepared for a crowd to stop and stare at you and ask for money - so make sure you're always on the move! My wife and I will try a food stall once we have plucked up courage. Make sure you saunter through the stalls though if you're looking to select your fate. Stall number 82 (Simo) seemed a comical bunch able to recite soap opera phrases in side-splitting accents.

We expected acrobats , dancers etc , but there was nothing like this . It was just a place for locals to try and scam tourists , and beware of pick pockets and molesters which we did see with our own eyes . We tried the food on a stall that people had recommended here and it was awful , I dont know what some people must be used to , but this over priced offering is not even adequate ."

Frankly if the salesmen just sat back and were pleasant we would have bought loads. In reality they ruin it and we were intimidated away from most stalls. The cafes over looking the Jemaa El Fna were great places to people watch and see people being harassed with monkeys and snakes (yes it happens A LOT!). After gaining as little confidence we walked around some more but when enquiring about horse and carriage ride the drivers (probably 30 of them) mobbed us shouting prices then broke into a fist fight amongst themselves.

I had read quite a few reviews on here and seen it on TV many times, but none of that still prepared me for what it is 'actually' like. As me and my partner first walked into the square the first thing that hit us was the noise (which was almost very quickly followed by 1 of the many scooters whizzing by). There was all sorts going on as we wandered through towards the various food stalls that were just setting up for the night. We went there each late afternoon/early evening of our 4 nights, and found there was still plenty to see and do each time. Although I must admit I did start to get a bit fed up of constant hassle to buy things from the vendors at the souk in the left hand corner by the mosque, especially when then kept grabbing my arm. We much prefered the Berber souk which we accessed from just behind the opposite end of the food stalls, as it was much more relaxed and more of what I expected a souk to look and feel like. There is a few restaurants/cafes over that side and it was nice to take a break in 1 of these with a drink on the balcony and watch the ensuing melee down below, before going back for some more.Beware of the women doing the Henna tattoo's. My partner had 1 and was assured it was a brown 1 which is supposed to last a few weeks, but costs more than the orange 1's that only last a few days. Guess which 1 she ended up with....The snake charmers (as will most people will to be fair) will try and blag you silly money to have a few pics taken with the snakes, asking us for 300 dihram, but don't be scared to give them what you think its worth - they won't set the snakes on you if you don't pay up!"

They are amusing as they vie for your attention. It's cheap, try a few stalls!2. Everything has a price. in other restaurants things that were complementary (bread, etc) was extra here. They will put things in front of you that you didn't order. DO NOT assume it's free. You will be expected to pay for it. If you didn't order it immediately tell them so they can take it away. Check your bill. Twice.3. Avoid wearing anything flashy. I couldn't figure out why people only approached me from my group to sell me things. A friend who lives in Rabat told me it was my ring. I wear a fake diamond ring when I travel and in the dark area they think it's real. You will be hasselled less if you look like you have no money.4. They will try to sell you the best even if you want the worst. One guy told my aunt \"You want camel for price of donkey.\" To which she tried to explain \"NO, I want a donkey for price of donkey.\"5. Deeper in the souk you will find better prices (and more options). Don't think this is the only place to shop.6. It is really easy to get lost and separated even though it's physically a very small area. Have a rendezvous point in case you get separated.Overall, just enjoy the experience. It's like being in the middle of a movie set. People bustling and shouting. The smoke fills the air with smells of delcious foods and the lights twinkle everywhere.

We witnessed the monkeys physically being dragged on chains tied round their necks. They're also continually pulling at the chains trying to free themselves. Passing by them hearing them squealing from the tiny boxes they are locked in is heart breaking. The people who pay money to pose for photos with them should be disgusted at themselves.  Another negative point is that I'm fairly well travelled, especially to Muslim countries. I'm used to all the people trying their best to get you to come into their stalls etc and practically following you down the road to do so. However, Marrakech is the first place I've ever been where I've been physically grabbed and pulled towards a stall. I was absolutely furious and made it known I was! Apart from these negatives, the rest of the experience is fairly incredible. You get a sore head from your eyes constantly being drawn from one thing to another. It's fairly busy during the day but at night it comes alive. The food stalls are dirt cheap and the food is incredible - if you can get over western food hygiene standards!! The tagine is the best I've ever tried! There is a cafe on the edge of the square with a roof terrace that overlooks the square. Fantastic photo opportunity and amazing to just sit and watch all the comings and goings. You can't come to Marrakech and not visit this place, but just be alert and ready for the constant stream of sellers trying to sell you everything and anything."

I'm not sure that you can make a trip to Morocco and not experience this place but if I decided to go back to Morocco, there are a host of other places I would visit again, and this probably wouldn't be among them. Our tour guide described the vendors as \"sticky\" and they are. They don't readily accept the words \"la shukran\", \"la\" or even \"la la\" and by the time one has left you be another one has found you. Admittedly, they are very good at remembering people, so if you pass them again, you won't get another round. But admittedly, once you've made one round, there isn't much more to see. The square is also filled with western tourists that don't quite get the idea of appropriate dress and my preference is to just stay away from them. The souks are like many around Morocco, though we are reliably told that the products aren't hand crafted as in many other areas.I think this is a place worth seeing, but not for more than a day and a night."

If you are with young children then wachout for small boys and girls who may hand over any toy or biscuit to children and then ask for a euor or something for it, most of the time the shopkeepers/food stall owner will shout them away. I used to drink orange juice always at the same stall and used to waive at him all the time, it is best to waive and the touch your hand to your heart (which says you are greeting him from your heart) which is appreciated by the locals. we also met a shopkeeper who would not sell us a peice of cake for the children as it was not fresh, next day when we came again he was happy to sell as he had fresh stock. we enjoyed our stay in Marrakesh and would revisit again."

However, taking up a pew at one of the many bars/restaurants that have rooftop terraces, you soon realise how much there is to take in and how the square evolves over the course of day and suddenly springs to life at dusk.The snake-charmers are the worse offenders when it comes to attracting the tourists and they charge you if you want to take a photograph. They will often approach you, even when you ask them not to, and try to tempt you to towards their stand. Quite frightening if you do not like snakes and intimidating as they work in gangs to lure you in. All the while, very entertaining to watch from afar.The night market is perhaps the most entertaining time of day when the street food stalls are in full swing and their waiters attempt to entice you to dine at their stalls. Smoke fills the air and you are overwhelmed by choice of food and banter from locals. A good tip is to take antibacterial handcream and only eat the very hot (and thus well-cooked food) street food. Germs are rife and we both experienced food poisoning after a visit. Definitely worth going back time and time again."

But on the other hand the performers are merely carrying on tradition in 21st century style. And sunset over the Atlas Mountains is stunning."

However, eating in the heart of the square in the evening is a definite highlight. Get to see what the locals experience - orange juice stalls, tajines, snails and seafood will get your mouth watering.

At night the place just seems so crazy, the noise level is high and the air is filled with smoke from the cooking food. I don't mind the sounds and smells and smoke, what I did not like are the aggressive attitude of the hawkers. It felt like every 3 steps you take somebody accosts you offering you dinner, or a henna tattoo or souvenirs or whatever it is they are selling. I could understand the competition for a sale but it could get VERY overwhelming and intimidating. I probably would not want to come back here at night unless I am with someone who is obviously local as it seems that the obvious visitors are hassled the most."

Absorb the orange juice in any of its stalls, this will give you the energy needed to stay in this place of unrest. Avoid any kind of people, especially taxi drivers, merchants, snake owners, tatoo women, shoe polishers, generally anybody else than tourists.

In a way, I was glad that I was prepared, but so happy I didn't let them put me off.The square is unlike anything I've ever experienced before. Through the day, it's filled with henna artists, snake charmers, monkeys, men in traditional berber dress, orange juice stands and plenty of horse and carriages. By night, it transforms to an outdoor market and is filled with hundreds of food stalls, making you spoiled for choice about where to eat! Locals and tourists alike all come out to take in the atmosphere...but it takes some getting used to. The sounds, the smells, the sights, everything in excess!My advice, never let your guard down. If you buy something (like orange juice in our case), always check your change. While we tipped often and well, we preferred it to be our choice. While walking through the square, beware that cars and motorbikes/mopeds will come from nowhere! They will go around you, but it's still a little disconcerting! Also, be prepared to have to pay for any pictures you may take..snake charmers don't do it for the art, they do it for the money and if someone puts a monkey on your shoulder, they'll expect you to pay for the pleasure, whether you asked for it or not!But, with all this said, it was an amazing experience, something I've never had the pleasure of seeing before and would definitely recommend to anyone."

As with the other reviews on here be prepared to pay if you take a photo of the snake charmers and water men who by the way are not the kindest of people, I was videoing... they got into shot then demanded money, they cornered me and were shouting and touching me.. was a little scary.. i deleted the video and told them where to go....The orange juice, I was looking forward to tasting this famous orange juice, what a let down, it is diluted with water and i can most definatly get better tasting orange juice out of a carton or better still frehsly squeeze it myself.... We could of sat all day watching the life on the square unfold, so much to see, it truly is an amazing place to behold, had for a restaurant for lunch called CHEZ CHEGROUNI, this place is situated at the narrow end of the square, the meat (lamb) tagine was the best lamb i had in Marrakech at only \u00a35.00... and i sampled some \"fine dining\" in marrakech !"

By day a vast concrete platform for scam artists with monkeys, snakes or henna; by night it transforms into a busy, bright, noisy place with a charming Moroccan beauty (as well as the scam artists!). Certainly an experience not to be missed, the food is beautifully cooked and the atmosphere is fantastic. Walking around the stall staff will pick up on your nationality instantly, offering hilarious phrases (normally from tv 10-15 years ago) spoken in your local dialect. We chose the most convincing \"only fools and horses\" impression and ate there. The prices are very reasonable and worth a try.During the day especially, please do be aware that while the majority of people are harmless and friendly, tourists can be targeted (it can get crowded) so keep a hand in your wallet's pocket if standing in crowds and don't accept \"gifts\" - on our first day my girlfriend ended up with a very expensive henna tattoo - so don't let people hold your hand, place a snake round your neck or pose with a monkey before arranging a price, and don't afraid to walk away if you feel your polite \"non merci\" is not being heard."

Do, however, try to remember where you saw items as it may be that only that stall has that design in stock at e moment so you can go back there.I was nervous of haggling but it is fun once you start. Don't be afraid to be cheeky or walk away. The smallholders won't take offence and you shouldn't either.Lots of smallholders will call out to you.

The orange juice sellers and horse-carts are out as are the souks and restaurants. Highly recommend - a definite must see in the evening."

I first visited the square by day and had a look at the cafe's to plan my next evening visit to take photographs. There is nothing on earth to compare with this. The whole place explodes with activity once the sun has set and is teeming with people. Whilst dodging the horse poo, bikers, horse drawn carriages and snake charmers, it is a place to try to enjoy whilst trying to keep your wits because there are many distractions and it is easy to misjudge the intentions of the locals. It is quite safe if you take care and enjoy the chaos that is this square! Afterwards go to one of the cafe's around the square and have a soft drink as majority of the cafe's and bars around the square serve no alchahol. Altogether an absolute must if you are in Morocco!"

This place is not only a UNESCO World heritage Site, but also the most popular touristic area of Marrakesh for both foreign and local tourist. The place in one word is magical and seems it came out from the pages of Arabian Nights, especially at night. During day time, the Medina is full with snake charmers and tribal waterman. Most of the time the snake charmers encourage the foreign travellers to hold snakes for photos. Once photo taken, they start to ask for good amount of money and there is no escape. If you want to take a picture with snake, first fix a price with the snake charmer and then take photo. I have 15 dirham to a snake charmer and took many photos of him with snakes. Same goes with waterman, they also encourage people to take photos of them and start asking for money. But you can still enjoy the place is you keep your eyes open and be bold. At evening the whole medina turns into a magical place with 100s of food stalls. I smell of the food is overwhelming and intoxicating. It is difficult to resist the temptation of trying the foods. So be bold and try anything you like. The stalls sell chickens kebabs, lam kebabs, fish, sea food, vegetables and many more food items. There are few stalls selling freshly squeezed orange juice and they are nice and cheap. Few stall sells snail soup as well. The sail soup stalls are popular among the locals. I will recommend this place strongly as trip to Marrakesh is incomplete without going to Medina. Be hold and enjoy the atmosphere."

I would recommend sitting on one of the rooftop terraces for a drink. Firstly because the sellers start setting up their stalls around 5pm and it is an amazing scene to witness, and secondly it is a great way to get your bearings. The food served on the stalls is fantastic. I was really dubious about going having read some of the horror stories on here. we went into the square 4 times all together and all were good experiences, We found them to be less pushy then other places we have visited in North Africa and Turkey and although there were loads of tourists we were hugely diluted by the locals, giving it an authentic feel. We were blown away by the sights, sounds, smells and general ambiance of the place, could not recommend it enough. Keep your wits about you but don't be put off visiting!"

The general overwhelming foul stench was the most off-putting feature. One expects to be harassed as part of the course but I was followed for quite a while by a sinister, swarthy looking character wearing a suit who would have looked more fitting at a 1920's mafia poker game rather than the bazaar. Unsure of what to do, I deliberated with confronting the man then decided to approach two kind policemen to whom I pointed out the stalker. Immediately, the creepy character swiftly turned on his heels and disappeared into the crowds. I noticed the zip of my cross body shoulder bag was open. Annoyingly, I realised that 600dirhams had disappeared from the dark recesses. I would have thought that it would have been easier for Houdini to escape from a securely locked chest flung into the sea than prize money from me! Perhaps I am not the hardened and savvy traveller that I consider myself.I was very conservatively dressed - jeans, trainers and short sleeved t-shirt, as well as a icy glare that would have given Posh Spice a run for her money - as I did not wish to attract any attention and give off the vibe that I was 'up for it.' Still I was inundated with offers to be my boyfriend from male youths that looked as if they could do with a jolly good wash. I think if I looked like the hunchback of Notre Dame and had donned a burkha for my stroll around the souk these pests would still be following in droves like the rats enchanted by the Pied Piper. All things considered, it is imperative to visit Jemaa el Fna during a trip to Marrakech so not to disappoint when sharing tales with friends and family that will have expected you to do so."

Malnourished animals.Go and see for a day, but your better spending your time outside of the square and into the mountains where the true hospitable morrocans live and not out to get your next dirham.Watch out for the henna women they grabbed my girlfriend and nearly put a dirty henna pen on her, avoid any eye contact in this square.

First the square: in the daytime, there are stalls selling freshly squeezed orange juice, spices and nuts. There are also people with snakes and monkeys. If you don't want to be charged, then don't let them see you showing any interest in the animals/reptiles as they will plonk a monkey/snake on you and agree to a small price but once you take the photo they will demand a much higher price and become quite aggressive if you resist. Throughout the square and the souks, people ride dangerously on motorbikes so it feels quite unsafe and also the air is very polluted. In the evening, the square transforms and is quite magical with beautifully lit stalls where you find old men selling incense stones and sandalwood for burning, plus lots of other fascinating momentoes. The square becomes filled with entertainers and lots of outdoor food stalls (research these before you dine so that you can take some on board some food safety tips to void you getting the Morrocan equivalent of Delhi Belly!) The souks are very exciting but after your first 100, you find that they all sell similar types of things - spices, lightshades, pottery, leather goods, etc. We had some bad experiences with heavy handed salesmen. Again, if you show any interest, they will not let you walk off without making a sale. Even though it feels rude, you have to be assertive when you say you are just looking. They try it on with their pricing so, if you are interested, it's always a good idea to come in at about half the price they quote. Be cheeky, and if they let you walk out of the shop, then you know you might have bartered a bit too strongly! Warning: when people from one stall say that they have what you are looking for at another stall, don't follow them. They are often on commission with the other stalls and can become very aggressive if you refuse to buy. Similarly, be careful who you ask directions from as, again, they will not take you where you want to go to but will take you to a stall that offers them a commission for every customer they introduce who ends up buying. The best advice I can give generally is don't be too trusting and keep your wits about you, AND never pay the price that they quote (even negotiate with taxis)."

If you care about animals please do not pay these people as it only encourages more abuse."

My husband and I were a little apprehensive about what would greet us at Jemma el Fna after reading the many reviews on here, but we went anyway (how could you not?!). We had an amazing experience, it is very-very busy, you will see water sellers, orange juice stalls, beggars,monkey trainers, acrobats, bellydancers, Ganoua Musicians, Magicians, cigarette sellers, storytellers, Snake charmers, henna ladies and Millions and millions of people everywhere! Not to mention bikes, horse carts, human pulled carts, Caleche's, moterbikes and cars!We had no problem with henna ladies, a firm no and not engaging with them was sufficient, no problem with monkey men either, polite no with smiles. Same with snake charmers. You do need to be careful where you take photo's water sellers will try to run into shot so they can ask for money, if a snake charmer thinks you took his picture he will run over and demand money! But if you didn't then no problem.PHOTOS Set a price before taking pictures, we did this with water sellers, Ganoua dancers, and snake charmers, as well as some of the stall holders, they ARE very cheeky and will encourage you to take lots of shots and then demand more money, but just be firm and tell them they can have what you agreed, if they complain or disagree offer to give them nothing at all, make sure the money is in your hand and start to walk away, they'll soon settle for the agreed price. The food stall holders will chat and have banter but it's good fun and they are really friendly no hassle at all.BEGGARSThere are some beggars about, this is a poor Country, but we didn't find them a problem at all, they are far more insistant in places like India. It is fine to give small coins or bits of food if you wish, many of the Marrakeshi's give as charity is one of the pillars of Islam.HENNA LADIESThere are a lot of them about, we were warned by our Riad manager, that if they put any ink at all on you, you were expected to pay, and that agreeing a price first was imperative. I didn't want Henna as I don't trust the quality of the Henna they use, so I wore a scarf round my arms to cover them a bit, just to prevent any possible issues with grabbing and daubing, which I had read about on here, but it never happened, I was never grabbed, and only approached a couple of times, I just smiled and said no Thankyou, but kept walking.FOOD STALLSIf you come to the square you should try them, but pick busy ones, and I wouldn't choose anything you can't eat with your fingers, as I don't think the washing up facilities would be like home! We also took wipes and tissues, but there were children going round the stalls selling tissues to the patrons if you didn't have any. The food was cheap, and not bad, the atmosphere was fantastic! Stall 1 Aeisa - that has been mentioned a lot on here, was very mediocre, the food wasn't hot, and portions were bit small.  We also ate at number 81, which cost the same but the food was far better, the chicken skewers were tasty and well marinated, and piping hot. We wouldn't recommend sitting on the end of a table, you get pestered by children (not beggars just cheeky kids!) asking for your coke, or some food all the time. Be aware that there are pick pockets and opportunists about like any busy city, split your money into different pockets, don't bother with a handbag if possible, and don't pull out wads of money when buying things. We didn't have any problems, apart from being followed about by some cheeky kids for a bit. I had my bum felt for a potential wallet, they were disappointed though because all I had in my pants was my Butt!!CAFE BALCONIESA fantastic way to see all of Jemaa el Fna, and highly recommended, it gives you a break from the madness, but you have a great view of the activity, we went to Cafe Grand Balcon and played table chess to get a ringside seat! The drinks were pricy by Marrakech standards but you are paying for the show! We also had lunch one afternnon on the ground floor terrace of cafe de France.OVERALLYou should visit Jemaa el Fna preferably in the day and at night if you visit Marrakech, it is an amazing experience, an overload on the senses, of sights, smells and noise not to be missed. Go, Smile a lot, look after your money, be firm but nice, agree anyones pictures first, and just enjoy it, you get out what you put in!!"

Really loved looking around this place and even the kids coming up to you to sell their stuff was ok, the 'entertainment' at night is really interesting, you really feel the authentic atmosphere within this square at night. During the day there are lots to see also but you have lots of people approach you (monkeys, henna etc).Can see how some people may find it intimidating as some food stall vendors can be quite aggressive when trying to tempt you into their seats. The whole visit (actually the whole holiday) was spoilt by a local coming up behind my partner feeling her backside while smiling at her then melting back into the crowds. This really really angered me and spoilt our night here, we noticed perhaps 10 men raising their eyebrows repeatedly towards my partner which apparently means they are interested ! This feels like some sort of animal mating ritual when you are in the thick of it and should be avoided if you think this may upset you. Its unfortunate that the pest that decided to sexually assault my partner doesn't realise that his actions upset and annoyed us for days afterwards and my partner was afraid to go out at night after this visit. Surely the authorities should stamp out this behaviour as in our own countries that behaviour would get you locked up (at best)"

The square pumps with entertainers, boxing, betting, tarot readers, snake charmers and henna ladies. Everyone wants to sell you something, they will touch you, yell out at you and tell you how beautiful your eyes are. A smile and easygoing nature will get you through this square. Don't take offence, don't get angry, accept it for what it is and you will love it. Please be wary that if you do take a photo of any \"entertainer\" you will need to donate some cash. I felt safe here until about 10:30pm, after that for me, the atmosphere seemed to change and being by myself seemed not a great idea.

It cost us a lot of dihrams, so our first tip whn going to Jemaa el Fna is; bring coins! The way they insisted on getting payed for theire services( wich we didnt ask for ) is really hard to say no to if you havent been there before. We had to escape to a roof top cafe to breathe for a while and laugh about it all. There is so much to see and smell, it unbelievable. You have to see experience it both day and night to really see it all. There is a lot of shops there, so you can get almost anything you want. Food in the tents at night are really good and cheap.There are a lot of beggars and hustlers there, who are \"on\" you all the time, trying to get you to buy something or give them money.

Opinion on this site is divided between those who find the square an amazing and life-enhancing spectacle, and those who find it a squalid and frightening trap dedicated to the fleecing of tourists. We went after dark with open minds as fairly experienced travellers, expecting plenty of in-your-face hassle and ready to deal with it but taken aback by the aggression of the hustlers and their menacing hostility when rejected. We tried our best to see what the famous Marrakech buzz was all about, but there was little joy or charm in seeing scrawny animals abused to provide picture opportunities for tourists. Above all, the square is not for the faint-hearted. It is full-on bedlam: shrieking noise, choking dust and heat, surging crowds, throbbing drums, roaring motor scooters charging through the throng, and the incessant tugging at your arm by children and fake guides and strident demands for baksheesh. Amid this cacophony Arab bands play what sounds interesting and distinctive music and other talented performers catch the eye, but if you stop and try to listen or take a picture you will be surrounded in an instant by intimidating characters demanding large sums of money. Now, many people say they find this great fun and the highlight of their holiday and so forth. But I just didn\u2019t get it. To me, whatever charm and interest there might have been in the square has long since been replaced by a cynical and ruthless fleecing operation in which every tourist is seen as fair game. As for the fabled tourist police who were meant to calm all this madness down, we never set eyes on them. To put this in perspective, it has to be remembered that most Moroccans get by on very little, and perhaps it is na\u00efve to imagine that Western tourists toting expensive cameras won\u2019t be seen as a meal ticket, especially when \u2013 as other posters have said \u2013 the tourists are there to take pictures of how the poor Moroccans amuse themselves. So, it didn\u2019t do it for me, although I was glad I went to see it (and even gladder to get out in one piece). Yet the Moroccans in the square are not at all representative of the rest of the city: in our hotel, and in the new city and elsewhere, we found genuine friendliness, great courtesy and real charm. Away from the square, Marrakechis are delightful people. Perhaps it\u2019s no different from saying that a crowd of English lager louts are hardly representative of the English as a whole. Still, if you want to live dangerously and feel your hair stand on end, don\u2019t miss a visit. Hang on to your wallet, though. And I am aware many will take the opposite view and say I am missing the whole point of it."

We saw everything from people with monkeys and snakes hanging about, to a man who you could pay to pull your teeth right then and there. However, come to this square prepared. We knew that immediately we would be targeted to receive \"gifts\" from the sellers here -- a \"free\" palm reading \"gift\" in exchange for a \"gift\" of our money. Even taking a photo of a snake charmer will cause someone to come up to you asking for money. Only take people up on their offers if you plan to pay them -- if they put a snake around you neck, say no thank you and walk on unless you want to shell out some cash. And if you do take them up on their offer for that much-needed photo of you with a family of monkeys on your shoulders, only offer 1/3 of the price they are asking. Sure that story about their family starving sounds convincing, but it simply isn't true. Once you get past these slightly overwhelming first impressions of the square, you will have a great time. Enjoy the culture that is Marrakech!"

It is here in the heart of the old city of Marrakech that one can see so much life both during the day and more so at night.Watching the entertainment from the local people ranging from dancers,snake-charmers as well as others is enchanting. There are also the market stalls and plenty of places to eat and drink.I recommend the terrace of Cafe Glacier for the best vantage point for photographers who want to catch the action without your subjects being aware of you because down in the square the demands for payment for having pictures taken can be quite expensive by the time you have finished.The trip by taxi to and fro from lodgings to the square is very resonable at all hours. my friend and I who are two females found it very safe to wander around this area alone as long as you keep your wits about you.Highly recommended."

Some in our group who ate there got sick. Don't walk through the food area unless you like getting insults yelled at you when you don't stop. The snakes and monkeys looked pathetic, and I felt sorry for them. When you go, I advise going to one of the restaurants surrounding the square that has a 2nd floor outside seating area. Go upstairs, buy something to drink, and sit outside watching the activity in the square below. You can take all the pictures you want of the entire scene. If you go about 30 minutes before sunset you can get some great photos. Then go somewhere else for dinner."

I'll admit to borrowing the title of my review from a U.S. restaurant commercial, but it's the first thing that comes to mind when I remember Djemaa el Fna. As a resident of New York City, I call this crazy public plaza \"The Times Square\" of Marrakesh, with heart, soul, public performance, music, great people-watching, and of course, the food stalls. You can't visit Marrakesh without coming here. By sunset, over one hundred food stalls have set up, and it's really great to wander the aisles and marvel at all the culinary offerings. I like to sample as many as I can, so I order one dish from one stall, then move to another. There are stalls that offer a wide variety of Moroccan dishes, and others that specialize in one food group (the 'meat' stall was unnerving but delicious---cow tongue, brains, innards, etc.!). Be specific when ordering, because they may try to serve you more than you want. Also, be aware that bread, olives, etc. are all extra charges. And if someone from the stall offers to take your picture (with your camera), be assured that they will ask for money. Save room for the dessert carts that come up and down the aisles. After dinner, wander the square and catch the crazy energy of performers and musicians. As a single female traveler, I felt perfectly safe here, even at night, but as always in a crowded big city, take care with your belongings. I did not worry about eating the food, either. Bon appetit!"

If you are buying anything always offer them half of what they start to offer you. Haggle is the word. People say no pressure but if you say no they seem to get worse. There is a street off the main square where there is a lot less hassle (if you stand with your back to the souk it is on the far left hand side). In the day time there are snake charmers and monkey handlers as well as fortune tellers and henna tattoo ladies, be careful as they will talk to you and say you can take pictures then ask you for a lot of money. With the monkeys and the snakes the owners will just put them on you so if you are not up for it keep a distance. There are juice stalls everywhere which are really cheap and nice and refreshing in the heat. At night the square becomes an amazing place for eating. Make sure you choose things off the menu rather than letting them as it can become quite pricey with way to much food. In the souk make sure you can always see the way out, there are so many amazing things to look at but you can get trapped! There are people who work in the square and offer to show you around, these people are just trying to get you to buy items off there brother, son, sister etc. Once you have bought something there will be another stall that you HAVE to see, but try not to get sucked in.There are horse and cart rides which leave from the main square which are worth a go, just agree on a price before you set off. I would recommend going at night as its lovely to see everywhere lit up and is a lot cooler than the day.Its well worth going in the day and at night as it looks like a different place. Just be careful not to get ripped off!"

There's so much to see and do that your head will spin. Just keep your cool and tip the performers, snake charmers, and anyone else whose picture you take (ask them first) and then shop until your bags are full. Or, watch everyone else shop until their bags are full. Dinner starts around 7 and the food stalls/seating areas get full by 8. There is a lot to choose from, so take your time and look around to see whose food and stall looks cleanest and freshest. Definitely get fresh orange juice! Only 4 dirham and it tastes amazing. There are 30* vendors to choose from but they are all good. Ladies, cover your head if you want to not stick out like a tourist. This is a great place to sit and get elaborate henna tattoos, ESP at night when it's not so hot and you can sit and people watch while your henna dries."

Bargain is a rule to shop in Maroc so always bargain before u buy someting.* Just be carefull while u walking near monkies and snakes. They throw the snakes on to you and they dont remove it until you pay them.- Drinking cafee in big restaurants may be risky there was an terrorist attack to one of these cafe's in 2010"

I would have rated this a 5 if it wasn't for a little Monkey and henna tattoo incident. Be aware when walking through the square, especially the middle. At one point monkey's were thrown on my wife and I no matter how much we told them we weren't interested. The owners would then demand a ton of money. A lady covered head to toe in traditional islamic clothing also grabbed my wife's hand and started applying a Henna Tattoo with our her consent. When we pleaded that we didn't have any money yet (which we didn't) she said it would be free. Her story changed after she was done and started to demand money. If we would have known about these things happening we would have been more vigilent in the square but we didn't. With the exception of those two incidents the square is an amazing place and worth seeing. Walking around the outside, near the restaurants, would keep you away from the monkeys as well."

My husband and I arrived on a Sunday where some places are closed but it didn\u2019t seem to make a difference as there was a flurry of activity as we walked around Jemaa-El-Fna. This area has been described as the heart and soul of Morocco where life as it once was still thrives today. The sights and sounds of Jemaa-El-Fna transported us into another time and space, it was magical and captivating. As we walked around the square we saw vendors selling their wares, orange juice vendors (this is the land of great oranges and mandarins after all!), snake charmers (yes men encouraging cobras to come out and perform the dance), henna painters (women in their kaftans or takchitas ready to paint a selection of designs on hands and legs as you wish), musicians, dancers, acrobats and more. Both foreigners and locals alike gravitated towards this square for entertainment at all hours of the day and night. However the true beauty of Jemaa-El-Fna showed itself at night. The square took on an increased intensity and excitement as outdoor food stalls were set up within the square and more people descended towards its centre. It was hard to pass by the food vendors and not sample some of the dishes on offer as the aromas drifted throughout the square. My husband and I were fascinated by the storytellers who were encircled by groups of people enraptured by the stories they were telling. I\u2019m sorry that we couldn\u2019t understand the stories as this is where you will find the heart and soul of Morocco through its folk stories. The people gathered around the storytellers were like children listening attentively wanting to know what comes next in the story. This is what travel is all about - finding authentic places like Jemaa-el-Fna that are still true to its traditions - definitely worth a trip to visit."

I did not imagine it like this.Fresh squeezed orange juice parlors, henna painters and snake charmers are the main attractions during the day, while at night the whole place is revamped with food stalls and dining tables, offering everything possible to eat.Around it is possible to find in te many cafes a shady place to relax and have a drink, or just to watch from above the hassle and buzz of the market."

The people were all very friendly and so long as you are firm in saying \"no\" they won't hassle you too much.I would advise that you watch out for the snake charmers, monkeys and henna tattoo ladies as these people are a little harder to shake off. They are however quite easy to spot and avoid should you wish to. (Make sure you speak to a guide or holiday rep about how much you should be paying for things, they do expect you to haggle and if they see you are a touriswt will try and rip you off)!The square it self was a bit barer than I was expecting, however we did you mid afternoon and I have been told that the evening is the time to go as it is cooler and it picks up a bit. I would definitley recommend buying a glass of fresh orange juice from one of the many stalls, at 40p you can't go wrong! If you can get into one of the cafes on the edge of the square as well, most have rooftop terraces which are great for panoramic photo opportunites with a nice view of the Atlas Mountains in the background.Overall worth seeing as it is known as the heart of Marrakech, but there was nothing special there."

Said monkeys and snakes will be thrown on / at you if you accidentally wander near enough, and then of course, money will be demanded with a certain amount of menace for the pleasure.It is physically impossible to enjoy any of the things in the square that might be interesting or pleasurable, because every moment of your time will be spent fending off henna tattooists (Aggressive as pointed out by many others - will grab your hand if you are a girl without asking and start drawing, then demand payment even if you just say 'no' right from the start) men in traditional dress who will demand cash if they are anywhere in your general vicinity if you are foolish enough to try and take a picture of anything, and young men and children who will follow you home a demand yet more cash for .... well, for absolutely nothing.Oh, and the 'hash' (Drug) dealers - lots of those too.Best advice I can give you?

It took any pleasure out of trying to just absorb the cultural experience.The beggars can be quite aggressive too, with one woman actually doggedly following us and repeatedly tapping me on the shoulder.Lastly, there are motor scooter riders zooming amongst the crowded square, nearly hitting pedestrians, so one had to be on the lookout, constantly, and ready to literally jump out of harms way.As you can guess by this review, we were disappointed in the experience."

In the day it is occupied by orange juice stalls, water sellers, performance animals, snake charmers and street entertainers. There will be Henna ladies and various assorted characters who want you to spend money with them. Later in the evening, the Square becomes more crowded. Part of it is replaced by food stalls where you can sit and eat. The entertainers, dancers and story tellers emerge and there is a little bit of organised chaos. It is this aspect of the Square that has been recognised by UNESCO in its aims to raise awareness about the importance of oral and intangible heritage as an essential component of cultural diversity.It really is the soul of Marrakech and would be a must see in any visit to the city."

Next definitely go into the souk, but its better with a guide as its huge and there are many good sites you may miss if you wander in alone. Be expected to be ripped off, you won't receive the \"moroccan price\" unless you're with moroccans. Just try to haggle and remember that they will always go lower. At night this area turns into a restaurant area which is quite cool but once again expect to be bothered, just make sure you take the time to pick where you want to eat, as there are different things in different areas--also carts go around with some traditional desserts, if you like almonds, enjoy! if not, stay away as nearly all the desserts are filled with almonds in one way or another"

The 'masters' often ask for as m uch as \u00a315 per monkey and they do try and get as many on you as possible. Agree a price before letting them sit on you, a friend of mine had that trouble. Also the monkeys will rob you given half the chance so keep your goods zipped away.In the morning its so peaceful between 9 and 1pm, Marrakeans dont start work till 1/2 in the afternoon after the highest heat has gone so you can shop in peace.

Get your camera out in their vicinity and they get irate, even if your not tring to take a photo of their poor little reptilian captives. There are people with chained up monkeys too, which didn't appeal to me either. Watch out for the mopeds too, they are buzzing about all over the place, and through the souks too.At night, the place comes alive. The locals are there in force, eating and enjoying the entertainment. The food village that springs up in the evening is fantastic and a great place for a cheap meal. I ate there three times and recommend the smaller stalls that don't have gangs of jolly chaps trying to drum up business. One stall selling vegetarian dishes with beans and lentils was superb and cheap. It doesn't sound very exciting but it was very good indeed. Another small stall just selling fishy things was very good too. Avoid the ones selling a bit of everything. Ons stall that always had a big crowd, right on the edge of the food 'village' was selling sausages and other tasty looking meaty things. It looked great but I could never get a seat! Don't forget the orange stalls. A big glass of fresh OJ for 4 dirhams - fantastic! Entertainment in the evenings is quite low key. Groups of blokes thrashing discordant instruments and bashing drums but it is atmospheric and quite interesting and the locals love it. You will be asked for contributions, though, so keep a few coins ready and ignore any requests for bigger donations.One wierd and quite pointless fairground game is trying to lasso bottles of fizzy drinks with gaily painted fishing rods.

The hundreds of food stalls for the evening festivities had not yet been set up. This place is unbelievable ! The souks that were off the square had remarkable deals on all things Moroccan. The aromatic spices and the light filtering in through the roofs of the many stalls will make you feel like you have been transported back in time. Squabbling is a way of life and expected from the buyer. Returning through the labyrinth of souks to the main square, I made the mistake of looking at one of the Barbary Apes chained to their owners. The ape was immediately thrown on my back, which is an interesting experience to say the least, then the owner demanded some money. I quickly walked away only to be confronted by a guy that thought I was taking pictures of his king cobra....Again, a demand for money. I caught on to the fact that the owners of these exploited exotic animals have \"spotters\" in the crowd which alert the owners and will confront you if you stare too long. By now the square was being transformed into a multitude of food stalls. Amazingly the entire process took only about 45 minutes ! Now I was surrounded by every possible smell and food product, some recognizable, most not. I did not realize that snails and their broth were a Moroccan specialty. I passed on the \"treat\"...The square is fantastic as it turned from flying apes to snail stalls ! I found a restaurant that had an upper terrace and watched the bustling crowd below. Definitely worth the walk from the hotel."

When we arrived at 4pm it was more or less empty. There was a couple of snake charmers and a few monkeys on chains. We couldn't even look from afar without them running up to us demanding money. My partner made the mistake of not agreeing a price before a snake was put on his neck which then resulted in us being insulted and shouted up as we left having given them 20dh for a quick photo! We decided not to return at the evening as we didn't feel that safe after having witnessed someone getting stabbed in the souks and then someone trying to snatch my i-phone from my hands as I was taking a photo. I'm sure if it had been fuller at least the enjoyment of seeing lots of things would have outweighed everything else, but as it stands we weren't very impressed!"

Not when one of the snake charmers henchmen assumes I have taken a photo ( I hadnt) and demands money. They can be quite aggressive so stay calm and show them the last photo taken. This became really annoying. I did ask to take a photo a few tines and paid accordingly.Be careful of your belongings at all times as there are many pick pockets also.

Around 4pm food stalls start popping up and by 5pm are in full flow with the smoke billowing to let you know they are cooking. I wouldn't recommend the food or the drink stalls, the restaurants screw you out of an extra 20/30 dh per person. They could tell you they will charge you for bread etc and make it all very pleasant but they don't. The food is generally lower quality, smaller portions and colder than elsewhere.

My wife and I spent three days in Marrakech and explored the Jemaa el Fna square on several occasions during the day and evening and found the experience remarkable and at times overwhelming. Prepare yourself for sensory overload. The square was jam packed in the evening with people from seemingly all corners of the globe gathered around in restaurants, dining on street vendor food, and enjoying performances. We were told to beware the food vendors in the evening because their cleanliness practices were not the best, but you're definitely safe in any of the numerous restaurants surrounding Jemaa al Fna. As for performances, we showed interest in a snake charmer one morning and before I knew it I had three snakes draped around my neck and I had swapped hats with another snake charmer. Also, my wife had her camera taken out of her had by another snake charmer who began snapping away to get as many pictures of me with his snake charming friends before the began asking us for 200 dirhams, which was way too much for their \"performance.\" Let's just say that in the end we paid them much less and that the entire time I was more concerned about the snake charmers themselves than the black hooded cobra two feet from me. However, in any large square with that many people gathered together you always have to be wary and use caution. It was totally worth the experience, but anyone and everyone will be eager to make a few bucks from you if they can."

In general the place has been tainted by tourists! If you walk in here, expect to be looked at as an ATM. They know you have money and they want it! I travelled around - in my opinion (and our local berber driver) - the real Morocco; stopping at small villages, brought our own groceries to a local man who grilled it right there beside us, shared an apple with a curious wild monkey, had tea with a desert nomad who had nothing but insisted to give us tea, picked up 5 berber women on the side of the street to give them a lift to the next village. Then coming to Jemaa el Fna made me so upset and sad because this is all a show! It might have been a world heritage sight years ago but not anymore. And if you didn't know: The snakes that they have here, - their mouths have been sewn together so they can be placed on the shoulders of tourists - they eventually die by a mouth infection and how they eat, I don't know, they probably don't. And when they die, they capture new ones, just so the tourist can have their pictures taking with a snake..... The wild monkeys we saw in the forest have been captured by the monkey owners at Jemaa el Fna, where the monkeys get a chain around the neck, placed in diapers and have to jump every time the man shakes the chain. = these people might not know any better, but I certainly hope the tourist soon will!!The reason why I have chosen to give some positives if because it at night is more appealing with music, games and good food!"

If you walk in the periphery of a crowd of locals surrounding a guy selling some snake-oil remedy - you'll be singled out as a tourist and have to immediately walk away. There is nothing authentic that I could find about this place. You could arrive early and grossly overpay for a drink so you can sit on the roof of one of the surrounding cafes (we picked Cafe Glacier, which seemed to have the best view) and watch the goings-on.

I would definitely recommend looking for the stalls with locals because those are the better places that tend to specialize in a few dishes rather than trying to serve every type of Moroccan dish. The servers can be really pushy trying to get you to eat at their stall, just keep walking, smile say no and don't feel pressured :) On a side note, the fresh orange juice is delicious (and nutritious) and the fresh dates are also really good."

At night it is just fun to stroll around and experience what is going on around you, it is mad and crazy but enjoyable.Walking around the food stalls you will be continually hassled by the stall vendors but in a fun way and as long as you get their number for going back to, they will leave you alone. We ate at one of the food stalls which came recommended and if you like fish look out for number 98. There were no vendors here trying to 'sell to us' and when we sat down we seemed to be the only tourists, the rest locals. We had two portions of sole, chips, one portion aubergine and one of tomato and bread at a cost of 50drm and it was excellent and no upset tummy etc afterwards.Finished off with another stroll then a coffee on a terrace overlooking the square. A most enjoyable evening and one everyone should experience when visiting Marrakech.EnjoyBrian - homeexchange50plus"

Not long come back from a week in Marrakesh and obviously as its the main square we spent a lot of time here.I have really mixed feelings, because as an experience of a different culture it was amazing in some respects but scary and horrific in others.Yes, its great to sit in a restaurant overlooking the square and watch from above, but when you are in the square you are constantly hassled for money, followed and have people trying to get you lost so that they can get money out of you to take you back. On the way to the square in the evenings, and in the day for that matter, we constantly had people blatantly trying to tell us that the square was in the opposite direction. We are two girls in our 30's and were always fully covered and respectful, but on the first night we had a terrifying experience. All the approaches to the square are narrow cobbled streets - this is just the medina- but on certain nights it would appear that local gangs gather to squash people with the sole purpose of pickpocketing and groping.We were suddenly caught in a massive crowd, squashed together unable to move and thats when the groping started, hands blatantly everywhere - one guy even undid his trousers and started rubbing himself up against me.... I was horrified. We were spat at and called racist when we politely declined persistant attempts to be dragged into herbalist shops.I'm glad I went, because the experience of the different culture was a real eyeopener, but I'd never go again. If we had been older, or with men, maybe the experience wouldn't have been so scary..... but it was."

At night a lot of food stalls are set up at the edge of the square, many selling basically the same foods, and lots of juice stands. The centre of the square itself becomes very dark and filled with the local people. We have visited many night markets all over the world, esp those in Asia. Maybe the travel writers made this place a bit more glamorous, exciting, exotic and mysterious than reality. Still worth at least 1-2 visits both at daytime and nite."

            "review": "You should definitely go once, but go with eyes wide open.. I think we tourists all envision the square to be an exotic gathering of locals, tourists, entertainers, and food stalls. Yes, I don't doubt it might have been this way once, but the reality is that it is officially a tourist attraction. The locals are completely aware of this and will work very hard to get money from you in many different shapes, sizes and forms. I would recommend visiting, but go prepared and have your wits about you.The first night I went there, I wanted to go to Stalls 1, 14, 32. However, the food stalls are not in any order. I was able to spot 1 and 32 easily; 1 was in the Northeast corner of all the food stalls, and nearby 32 was in the Southeast corner. However, 14 was not found. I wandered up and down the aisles of food stalls and this was a terrible idea. I was getting grabbed and stopped by every food stall worker, luring you to sit down and eat at their stall. I would politely say no and ignore, but that wasn't enough and I also had to aggressively pull my arm away. We finally gave up and sat at 32 to have some of the lamb sausage they are known for. The entire place is packed, but I actually didn't think it was very good. We grabbed an OJ at nearby stall to wash away the taste.I also avoided eye contact with any of the men with the animals (monkeys, etc) and did not stop to admire any of the belly dancers (they were not good) or the men with their ornate costumes and instruments. I also knew not to take a picture with any of these people, as they will immediately ask for money. I did, however, stop to watch locals playing a game that involved fishing rods. I surreptitiously took a picture with no flash, and immediately a man approached us for money. My husband at first resisted and was causing a scene; I was worried other cohorts would join in the argument. I persuaded him to give the guy a few DH and we were on our way. So, overall, avoid pictures in the Southern part of the square that has all the entertainers. It is not worth it, unless you are ok with parting with a few DH.This particular part of the square is also very dark; the food stalls are lit up by all the lights that are hanging, but the entertainers gather in very dark places. Whenever there was a crowd huddled around a certain entertainer, I did notice young boys that were cruising the crowds and looked like they were trying to pick pocket. If you are using a bag, keep it in front of you and zipped up. If you are a man, try to wear pants with zipper pockets or keep your money in a safe place. My husband was also approached to buy illegal drugs; ignore and keep walking. As for the ladies, watch the women that want to do henna on your hands. Most are easy to ignore because they beckon you from a seated position. However, some are more aggressive. They will compliment you and even if you decline, they will grab your hand and try to give you a \"sample\", or \"gift\" and will attempt to henna your hand. I would quickly snatch my hand away; make sure those henna pens do not leave a drop of ink on your skin or they will demand money.I was a little shaken by our initial visit, but we were undeterred and came back again another night. This time, we went straight to Stall 1. Yes, the entire place is tourists, but we wanted an easy, casual meal. The food may not be the best, but it was good enough and cheaper than many of the restaurants in the area. Also, whomever the food stall worker that seats you and takes your order - stick with that person for all of your additional orders. I think they all fight for tips; whatever they get, they keep. So, we stuck with one man, Fiesl, who was so helpful and friendly. We enjoyed his service so much we came back the next night. He immediately remembered us, sat us down, and even wanted to take a picture with us. He was truly the shining star in an otherwise chaotic square.Also, be aware that there are little children and women selling tissues. Oh, yes, bring your own hand sanitizer and tissues! This proved to be invaluable in my visit to Marrakech as a whole. Sadly, there are tons of women and children that have been thrown out on the streets to fend for themselves. You become numb to it, but there are times we would have small pocket change or leftover food and we would give them to the beggars we would see on the way back to our riad. I was hesitant to do that in the square because everyone will swarm you, but perhaps be mindful of them when you can.Lastly, I enjoyed finishing off our trip to the Square with a stroll to Patisserie des Princes. It is on a pedestrian only street directly south of the Square. It is lit up with white and red lights down the middle of the street. The Patisserie is on the left. They sell gelato (I liked Nougat) for 9DH. Overall, it was definitely an experience. If you go in cautiously, but also don't take it too seriously, you will come out having a good experience."

We were pounced on as soon as we got there by four different guys thrusting menus in our faces telling us they all serve the same things so come to my restaurant. But one asked us \"What's the craic???\" and being Northern Irish we had no choice but to eat there. The veg thing was disgusting, the meat kebabs were only ok and considering we only had two bottles of water, almost 200 dirhams was kind of extortionate. There were some other places off the square that are more reasonably priced and the food is better. But don't miss out on going at all.Just keep an eye out for people with snakes and monkies...they will want money! ANd shout for police if they give you bother."

Having spoken to some locals about it, they think it is losing its identity - not very authentic any longer and mainly for the tourists. The orange juice sellers in the morning water down their juice with water...so if you have a weak stomach, probably best to avoid this....food in the evening at the stalls is overpriced for what it is, it's not amazing quality-but a fun experience. The poor horses who drive unthinking tourists around mostly look like they are dying on their feet so probably best not to support this. Also, I have serious animal welfare concerns about the snakes as some of the snakes being held by the snake 'charmer' looked pretty lifeless/possibly drugged. Henna women will grab you by any means so do stay clear of them if you don't want a little 'gift' left on your hand....remember that nothing comes for free and you should be okay."

If you are not keen on getting a henna tattoo, do not let the ladies in the square grab your arm even if its 'free' or 'a small gift to try', because it will NOT be small and it most definitely will not be FREE!! under any circumstances, do not pay more than 50 dirhams for it (app. 4 pounds) and and agree on the price BEFORE SHE STARTS!!! also, if you don't want anyone to put snakes, monkeys and other animals on you, do not make eye contact with them, and if they approach you say NO once, and firmly. just ignore them if they persist. if you are going to take poictues of them, be prepared to be asked for money - which is the case EVERYWHERE in Marrakech! before taking a picture of others (unless its a general one, i.e. of the square, the souks etc) check if you have to pay. and 20 dirhams for a picture (1.50 pounds) is the absolute maximum!!! :p DO negotiate the price for EVERYTHING, no matter how guilty you feel at first and no matter how hesitant the seller is. if he is not willing to lower the price, just walk away - you are guaranteed to find it elsewhere for a LOT cheaper and there is a 85% chance he WILL come after you with a lower price!! :p"

Jemaa El Fna square at night is just a tourist trap and in my opinion not even entertaining. Dark, seedy and very dodgy. The snake charmers, male belly dancers etc just want your money and if you don't play along they are verbally abusive. Go for half an hour and never go back. We made the mistake of eating at stall 118 and were totally ripped off..avoid. This is in total contrast to the rest of our experience in marrakech where we were met by friendly, helpful people everywhere. Would recommend the Marjorelle Gardens, Gueliz and L'Hivernage area for bars/restaurants and day trips out to Ourika Valley and Ouzoude waterfall.

            "review": "Manic and Chaotic. On our first full day in Marrakech we took a taxi from our hotel (Le Meridien N'Fis) as we had not orientated ourselves. The taxi driver did the usual 'its closed today, go this evening I take you on tour' which we declined and after going in the wrong direction for some time eventually we managed to get him to stop the taxi in the Medina and find our own way to the square!During the day there are juice sellers (the water they sell is sealed and fine to drink didn't try the juice) snake charmers, 'costumed water sellers' and a variety of musicians. If you want to interact with the above they will flock to you like magnets and you can quickly become surrounded by jostling musicians placing their hats on your head, they will then look to be paid 10 - 20 Dirhams each for the privilege, fine if you want to interact in this way, but they will also do this to you as you merely walk past. One gent placed a live snake around my husbands neck without any interest in him being indicated, whilst we were walking through the square to the souks, it took several strong requests in French before this man removed the animal, and still he looked for some money. You may well be fine with such behaviour, but if you are not be firm and keep walking, they are after making a living and won't pursue you for long. The souks lead off the square which were very pleasant to walk through, there are polite invitations to look at the various shops but no hard sell. In the evening the square transforms into a large number of eating stalls serving all manner of foodstuffs, there are also dancers, musicians, show shine, snake charmers, monkey handlers to name but a few. The dancers and musician attract large groups of both locals and tourists around them, this is the time to be aware of pickpockets, which are no worse here than anywhere else you may find them, just be aware. I looked around and noted two young men who were obviously looking at us with more on their mind than what clothes we were wearing. I caught the eye of one and shook my head, at which they both moved away. This place is perfectly safe and I would have had no problem being there on my own, we split our money between various parts of clothes mostly in an anti pickpocket wallet down the front of my husbands trousers!To get a good view of the evening activities make an early reservation in the La Marrakchi restaurant in the north west corner of the square. It has an upstairs dining area with panoramic views across the square, with Moroccan and European dishes on offer. They offer a variety of wines with a good Moroccan red being about 190 Dirhams.Also available from a promenade which leads from square to Avenue Mohammed V are the caleches - which a horse drawn carriages. These will whisk you around the Medina for an hour for about 200 dirhams. There are touts who will approach you offering the services of the horse carriages, we chose to deal direct with the carriage driver and where then harangued by one of these touts who decided that we had slighted him in some way, and owed him money! As neither my husband or I are timid creatures we gently but very firmly told him that we chose who we hired and he should go away. His friend eventually took him away. We used carriage number 180 which has a lot of polished brass with two very well looked after horses, he proudly displays yearly awards he has had for the excellent care he gives to his horses. If you want to avoid the touts walk along any of the streets and you will soon be approached by a passing caleche, likewise this is the best way of getting your taxi as the touts operate even more aggressively in this area for these especially at night, one tried to drag me out of a taxi as he wanted me to use his, I dared him to touch me and almost growled at him. Not a pleasant experience and not one I would want to repeat. A good alternative during the day is tourist bus, it stops on demand as well as having designated stops, you can get it from the caleche and taxi area, for 24 hours its 145 Dirhams per adult and for 48 hours 190, so good value. You can hop on an off when and wherever you want, and you can get to and from just about all the main attractions. If you are staying in the Le Meridien it stops just outside, runs every 30 minutes, last one being 1745 hours.We had planned to eat in the square one evening, we love street eating in the Far East, but for a reason I cannot explain we didn't do so, possibly that there were some aspects that I found distasteful eg snakes and monkeys being dragged and draped around.An excellent place for lunch is the Marrakech Ground Zero restaurant which is located opposite the Koutoubia Minaret and Mosque, with open terrace and closed dining. Does Menu du Jour, but highly recommended is the excellent Salade Nicoise.If I can help further please do not hesitate to contact me."

After being there for a few mins i just didn't understand what the hype was about.It's a square, which during the day has hundreds of people pestering you to either buy orange juice, photos with monkeys (don't get me started on them), photos with snake charmers, or henna tattoos, and that's about it. Very busy, and you can't just stand still for 5 minutes to relax and take in the sight. At night it gets really busy, with food stalls, storytellers, dancers, etc. Again, constantly getting pestered. We sat down to eat one night as we wanted to experience having a meal on the square, what a mistake. Poor quality, cold and expensive for what it was, food. We ended up paying around \u20ac40 for two, and all it really was was poor quality spanish tapas type food. For a little bit more we were eating in beautiful, classy restaurants with wine. Every other restaurant person tries to quote English phrases, which for the first 5 minutes is amusing, until it gets very annoying!Unless we missed something this square offered nothing to our 4 day trip, and if anything we tried to avoid where possible going through it. We've been all round the world and visited many similar places, but just didn't understand what all the fuss was about!"

Everywhere else in Marrakech people were keen to speak to us, rather than just sell us something. The snake charmers were terrible, and later we found out that for special occasions they bus in real snake charmers. The snakes were just wandering off around the market chased by charmers. We started in the square on an organised tour and I was literally grabbed by one of the snake charmers and told - 'pay money to take photo', when I said I didn't want to he simply repeated over and over again, while holding on to my arm. In the end I was extremely firm and he shouted '[--] you' at me. I would simply say this is not the real Marrakech, the people are purely there to make money. The only saving grace was we ate at a very good food stall (117) recommended by our hotel. If you venture into the square I would recommend the chicken tagine there."

We also did not go up to the snake charmers as we know that as a tourist you will be ripped off, so we chose to watch from afar.

I really struggle with the treatment of animals, and stayed miles away from the snake charmers - I think animal rights organisations need to get a handle on this. The square bustles and comes alive at night, and I loved the energy and excitement. Moroccan culture means that you will be pestered, you will be asked to buy, you will be asked to see this and see that - its part of the excitement. IF this bothers you, stay in your Riad. Keep an eye out for pickpocketers - especially children who will prey on you, but stern words, and walk away with confidence and show you are actually in control (even if you dont feel it!) you will be fine. I loved enjoying the square from the restaurants, especially from the terraces, where you can enjoy the energy, without being pestered.Generally clean. The orange juice sellers were wonderful and that juice is so nummy!I did however expect more of a \"circus\", with acrobats, and dancers. The story-telling got lost on me - especially as it was all in arabic or berber, and there are only men which made me feel uncomfortable. The excitement for me was the cooking and all the stalls that roll in at sunset. Quite fascinating!"

Just shows how you shouldn't always listen to what others say!The square, whilst a reasonable size and certainly busy at times, was not as huge as I'd feared nor was it as packed as I'd expected. Which was a pleasant surprise.Plenty to look around, and a few things to watch out for.If you like orange juice, you are in luck! Many stalls selling very VERY fresh orange juice, sometimes squeezed there and then for you, pretty cheap and tasty not to mention refreshing.During the day there are various stalls selling all manner of wares, and by night the square transoms as it fills with countless open air restaurants each doing their best to tempt you to theirs which is always, of course, the best in the square... The food is good value and certainly tasty with meats, fish and salads aplenty. Things to watch out for - be wary of the people with snakes or monkeys, they will try to get the animal on to you and pose for photos, then demand money - watch out especially for the monkeys who often are trained to bite you if you start arguing about the price...And be careful of the \"henna\" people who will grab your hand and apply \"henna\" (not always henna) and demand money, you need to be firm and ensure they understand you do not want it before they start. A firm \"no\" or 3 does the trick.But those aside, the square is a lovely place to visit and hang out, the food at the stalls is tasty, and if you prefer something a little more sophisticated there are several cafes and restaurants around the edge of the square, some with balconies and terraces with good views over the square, great for a late night coffee before heading to bed."

It is NOT for the faint hearted!1) People WILL follow you to try and entice you to purchase their goods. They will stalk and pester you and it can be very disturbing. If you refuse to buy something when offered, you will often be SHOUTED OUT. I got called something incredibly hurtful because I walked past a stall holder selling orange juice and didn't want to buy any.2) Animal torture abounds here. Monkeys are CHAINED UP, BEATEN and FORCED to perform for tourists. It actually made me cry. 3) Women offering henna tattoos are disturbing and often supported by local gangs. I witnessed them start tattooing a woman WITHOUT HER PERMISSION. They then chased her down the street for payment. She was terrified and in tears and her husband had to shoo the gang away.4) The locals are terrifying and disturbing. As a previous reviewer stated, I too saw a woman get beaten by a man (presumably her husband). It was a disturbing and haunting sight that will stay with me forever. We got STALKED back to our hotel and it was a truly terrifying experience that I never wish to repeat. Locals stare at you with disgust if you stand out as a tourist.5) How anyone can eat here is utterly beyond me. There is NO CONCEPT of health and safety of food hygiene. Locals cook food after it has been dropped on the floor, and re-use cutlery without washing it. Yes, it's cheap, but isn't your health worth more?"

It was also a different shopping experience in December than it was in July - not so touristy and it was easier to get the price I wanted. I also learned between visits several phrases in both French and Moroccan Arabic: Thank you, No Thank You, How much ? Never mind, and Where is ? I found being able to say just those phrases was very helpful especially if English is your only language. If crowds are not your thing - go in the morning. By the afternoon and evening especially in the summer, the square is THICK with people. At night, the spaces that were open during the day are filled in with outdoor restaurants. Really an exciting place to be. Yes, there are public bathroom facilities in the Fna. Past the orange juice sellers, past the nut and date sellers, behind the garden shop you will find stairs leading down to the facilities. Ladies on the right men to the left. There is an attendant outside (pay small dirham). Inside you will find little buckets, a water spigot, stalls, and a hole in the floor of each stall. Enough said ! There is a post office in the square where you can mail packages back to yourself. It takes about two-three weeks from Marrakech to Boston. Do Buy: a Sabra Silk scarf, a pair of Babouche, a djellaba, a leather bag, Black Soap, Kissee, Set of Tea Glasses, Tray, Tea, and Pot,Tassels, leggings ( in winter - warmest things ever) , Sliver anything, a rug or runner, and other things to fill your suitcase ( bring one empty) Eat: Dates, Nuts, Msemmen ( for breakfast -to die for), a Tagine, Bread, Fanta orange soda ( yes Coke is there), fresh squeezed orange juice, prickly pears ( summer) and of course drink lots of Mint Tea- but don't forget to just wander around and be engulf in the wonderment of the Jem3 el Fna. d"

Forget in trying to bargain for shampoo and conditioner..The orange juice stands are incredible, very cheap (5dh per glass) but bring a bottle and they would do it for 20dh, you most try the juice! The restaurants far away from the Djemma el Fna are cheaper but hey 4dh is barely something in UK.During the day you have the snake charmers, the guys with the monkeys (which I personally don't like as I don't like animals for shows) If you don't like it, do as I do, completely bypass it. You have also the henna ladies, which you have to be careful for because they are FAST at doing hennas and in 5 secs can do the whole arm! Be very specific to what you want to get so there isn't any confusion or annoyance. During the night the place transforms drastically. There are restaurant stands selling everything. I most point out that they are VERY persistent with tourist to go and eat at their stand. I must also say that you are the visitor in Morocco and you must respect the way the do it, they even do it to Tourist Moroccans or Arabs from North Africa so it is a general rule. Just smile and kindly say \"you will come tomorrow Inshallah\" and they will leave you alone. Try to never be rude in Marrakech or to take it seriously. This is how they do it there and it is not personal, it is just another culture that once you experience, you will be very happy and will miss it lots!Back to the restaurant stands, they are not cheap for sure there are many other places to go and eat. There is one specially which is not inside the zone of restaurants but it is actually on the edge of the souq. It is exactly the same food but a little bit cheaper.. if it helps!You will find kebabs, skewers, lovely harira sauce with bread, olives, tajines, couscous, everything!

With 4 dirhams, you drink a freshly squeezed orange juice. You have to remain alert as you would do in all squares. There are so many entertaining acts that can easily distract you. It's a fun place to be to take the pulse of Marrakech."

There are also dried fruit and nut stalls, sweet carts that get pushed around, tea stalls with spiced tea (the white powder is menthol and will blow your top off!).

You have all seen the photos of the main square, Djemaa el-Fna, lit up at night, but nothing prepares you for the smells and sounds of the square. When your taxi drops you at the top end of the square you will walk past the highly decorated horse drawn carriages and then enter the square itself...bathed in an orange light and smelling of spices and warm desert air you will encounter snake charmers, musicians of all kinds and story tellers, there are stalls selling fruit, snails, nuts and spices and as you wend your way towards the back of the square you will see more stalls selling food, goats head meat for the brave, kebabs, chips and salad for those of you that hesitate to join the locals for dinner. Over 60 food stall keepers add to the noise and merriment in the square, persuading you to eat at their particular stall with cries of 'LOVELY JUBBLEY' and various other English sit com and TV advert stock phrases...to enable a quick getaway tell them you have just eaten! At the far end of the square, if you have had enough food and entertainment, there is the opportunity to shop, from bathroom products to wooly hats, lamps and tourist paraphernalia; it\u2019s all there waiting for you. Taking a wander down the ally\u2019s of the souk will test anyone\u2019s resolve not to spend money on things you don\u2019t really need, but there\u2019s the fun of it...how cheap can you barter for a cone of henna and a bag of figs? In the day time Djemaa el-Fna square is a great place to people watch and to spend time in the cafe's and balconied restaurants drinking coffee, eating cake, talking with friends or reading a book. It\u2019s a place you will never get bored with and you will return night after night, day after day."

They have food stalls, snake charmers, guys that throw monkeys (seriously, watch out), henna, toys, and everything else you could imagine. Things start up around sundown and continue to around midnight-1am. For food: -skip out on stall Number 1 (they're all numbered) even though it's where everyone says to go. UNLESS you want calamari; they're the only place with fresh hot fried calamari.-go to the black stall near the performers (perpendicular to orange carts) for what i've dubbed the 'egg pocket.' For 5 dirhams you can get pita stuffed with potatoes, eggs, and cheese that beats all of the tajines and couscous you find in the square. If you're looking for good tajines and couscous, you've come to the wrong place. Another good thing to keep in mind is that you WILL get hassled to eat at every stall and nothing will prevent that. If you know where you want to eat, stay on the edges far from the stalls and only swoop in when you have to."

The food is cheap and good. During the day you can get hassled. We found that learning to say \"no thank you\" in Arabic was very helpful at keeping pushy vendors at bay. The henna ladies can be very bad - I had to wrench my hand away before one could stain me! The orange juice from the stalls is refreshing and delicious. You can spend hours wandering around the alleys. If you get lost, ask a shopkeeper rather than a person, they will direct you in the correct direction."

During the day, vendors are everywhere on the square, along with the snake charmers and monkey tamers (we only saw each of these once though, as they are supposed to be outlawed in the square now). The souks are amazing and you can easily get lost in the passageways. Everyone wants you to buy from them and is happy to barter. Once you start bartering though, don't make a deal and then not buy. This is rude and insulting to the vendors if they come to your price and you then say no. A souvenier shoppers paradise, or a great place just to walk around and take in the sights, sounds and smells of the square. At night, the square is a place of activity, food vendors and the like. We did not end up eating in the square although that was our original plan. Our riad manager told us not to risk it as most vendors are not very sanitary and there is no one to regulate what is sold, how it is cooked etc. We saw vendors selling snails and then rinsing the used bowls in dirty water. We also saw vendors cooking and smoking over the food. This put us off eating in the square even though the smells were diving. We got caught by someone wanting me to take his picture - insisting - and then trying to get money out of me for the privilege....NOT happening. I told him off and walked away.Both my daughter and I got our bums grabbed numerous times at night in the square, either from passers by, or those standing around to watch the performers. Luckily it was only bums and not handbags (which we wore on the front, or did not bring at all). Saying this though, someone DID have the audacity to steal a handbag one night, and honestly, half the square chased him. It was amazing to see. A vendor told us that the people of Marrakech do not want this reputation and do everything they can to prevent purse snatchings and tourist intimidation. In this instance, I don't like to think of what happened to the bag snatcher, with over 200 or 300 people running after him!All in all, a sight to see, both at night and during the day."

You should scope out which one you like the best and go with her. There are a lot of cafes/restaurants around the square but none serve alcohol so if you are thinking of just hanging out at one of the restaurants/bars there, doing people-watching while sipping beer/wine, fuggeddaboutit!Be careful and aware of all your belongings, in Jamaa el Fna (and morroco in general) there are a lot of pick-pokets around waiting to lighten your load of cash. Be aware of all the various street performers, they are extemely pushy. They will catch hold of you and make you wear something like a cap or a snake around the neck or a monkey for picture to be taken. Well they expect money immediately since we took a picture with their stuff. It is best to say no immediately if you are not interested. One thing to remember when you are in the souks is to start bargaining with the shopkeeper only if you re actually interested in buying the item."

I believe in supporting the local economy and understand that the locals are trying to make a living, but being forced and harassed into paying for something I did not ask for was just not acceptable at all. One of the vendors physically placed 2 monkeys on my back after I repeatedly told him NOT to do so and had the audacity to demand money for it. I ultimately backed off and allowed him to take a picture of me with the monkeys. I paid him 100 dirhams (about 10 euros) for ONE lousy picture and he DEMANDED that I pay him more more. I just walked away. This happened again when I was taking a picture of my friend. Two guys in some sort of costume worked their way into the picture and then demanded we pay him money. Walking through the souks were somewhat better, however people were still pushy and one guy actually FOLLOWED us for 5 minutes trying to get us to visit his shop. Overall, I was glad I visited and Marrakech is a beautiful city with great history, but this will be certainly the last time I will step foot there."

There must be hundreds of hustlers, thiefs, con mans in and around this place. If you are visiting Morocco or any other underdevelopped country the first time, you will soon learn that these relatively poor people is after your money and they try to cheat and trick you in many different ways. They seem to think it is ok since you are richer. Watch your wallet carefully; be very clear to anyone showing you a direction or offering help that you do not need help; do never reveal any details about you, your hotel, where you intend to go next etc. They then follow you to your hotel or the place you want to go, or they go a few steps before or behind you and provide completely irrelevant information, then at the destination, they try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money for their \"guiding services\". When talking to the salespeople, do not even tell them your country of origin or your mother tongue because they will use this information immediately to \"charm\" you. If you do not want help or do not want to buy, always make it very clear that you are not interested, avoid eye contact and conversation. On the square, always have a few coins ready to give to beggars so that they do not harrass and steal from you or try to spit at you or touch you with their stinking and dirty hands. Never ever take your wallet out when a beggar is near you. Have a few small notes ready in your pocket for emergencies when you feel under a lot of pressure to pay a false guide and make him believe that this is all the cash you have. They will take and leave. If you show the wallet, they charge much more or ran away with your wallet. No chance to catch them. Avoid taking pictures of people on the square, they will immediately gather around you, behave very insulted and try to charge ridiculous amounts of money. If you take pictures, do from distance, ideally in the vicinity of a policemen or next to many other tourists who take pictures at te same time. Also, there are some very crowded and overprized restaurants where locals cannot enter because of prices and from where you can take pictures savely."

Our expectations were completely thrown at the square, as instead of the rude pushy sellers we were expecting, we were greeted by friendly and humerous individuals with their comical quips of ASDA price and fish and chips! Although they invited us to look at their stalls, when we explained we were just looking or walking they said maybe later and welcomed us to Morocco wishing us a good stay. I'm not too good at bartering, I always feel a little embarrassed, and am hopeless at suggesting a starting price, but I do know how much is 'too much' and stood my ground when I had seen goods sold cheaper in other stalls. It pays to look around and compare goods, and the sellers get to recognise you too, which helped when I returned to buy what I wanted as in most cases they were willing to give fair prices. The sellers have amazing memories and as we both have tattoos, it made it easier for them, we were often met with greetings of 'prison break' . It seems you only get a tattoo in morocco when you're in prison LoL.The 'Henna women' were the biggest pest! Walking around the square they call out to you and run up to you with their syringes full of henna brandishing books of photos, they often won't take no and on our first evening, one chancer grabbed my hand saying let me see tattoo and squirted henna onto me. I shouted , NO' at the the woman, rubbing the henna away in disgust, she just shrugged and walked away ... If you dont want henna, you have to be FIRM!I don't care much for animal handlers either, and think its very cruel to drag a monkey in a nappy around on a chain merely to make a quick dirham for the photo opportunities of tourists. They cage them ( unhappily I might add, listening to their screeches) in tiny boxes when there is no interest. Very sad sight. As for the snake charmers, well I watched a snake lurch at a passing man and made sure I kept my distance LOL. The food in the evenings at the square was fabulous. Basically all the stalls sell almost the same food just cooked or served differently. Everyone wants you to eat at their stand and the banter is fabulous. We made any number of promises to return the following day! We ate at a number of stalls, I have no recommendations except let your eyes and nose guide you!. We found the Morrocan salad fab with flat bread, deep fried aubergine and mixed olives and there is a variety of meats and fish to choose from and small enough portions to try different dishes each night. Mint tea was free courtesy of our host stalls although you may have to ask for it.Freshly squeezed juices for 4 dh was lovely and a massive choice of nuts and dried fruits available. Your dessert is a range of sweet pastries to choose from the barrow and at 30dh for a mixed box, there is fierce competition for your money with 2 barrow boys racing round the food stalls vying for trade.Try to get a rooftop view and have a Mint tea on the terraces at be if the large cafes. It's amazing"

These delights will set you back (after a barter) anywhere between 300dhs (which got a hearty laugh from us) and a pleasant spit on the ground in front of you.In all the Jemaa el Fna would benefit from 2 simple changes. Fewer motorcycles and a decree from the King that pushy locals desperate to rip you off should be forced to stay indoors during the moring. and the afternoon. and the evening. and at night.All that said, in the evenings the food stalls are pretty sound. Food is good. Sheep head is the local...delicacy...and the stall workers know every stereotypical english phrase in the book. Well worth a visit (esp. as the noms are 20-30dh per course) for the LOLZ. There is enough competition for your affections you can barter free drinks and food tasters without issue."

There are scooters/bikes and horse-drawn carriages coming at you from every direction, men with monkeys, snake charmers and cobras all over the place, street entertainers, dancers, fortune tellers etc etc. If you try to take a photo, they will demand money and can get quite aggressive about it. There are also all the market stalls, mostly with fruit and spices - but the most pungent fragrance is that of the horse manure. There are many small gift shops around the square so if you're looking for typical souvenirs like postcards, magnets, snow globes, this is the place to get them. You can't go to Marrakech and not visit this square, but you need to keep your wits about you."

Keep your wits about you, watch out for snakes, women grabbing your hand and trying to apply henna to it before you can say no, and everyone that wants to sell you something for a few coins or a photo op \u2013 at your expense. Do try the fresh squeezed fruit juice from one of the many carts (they are all the same price) and eat at least once from the stalls in the middle of the square. You will not be able to walk past without someone trying to talk you in to going to their stall.....but if you persevere, look for one that gives you a view of what you want, then take a seat and have a nice cheap meal (don\u2019t look too closely at how they are cooking it or cleaning up after!!!)"

I speak French and I was polite to people and no one followed me or grabbed me, no one tried too hard to sell me anothing or put a monkey on my shoulder! That said it busy and the animal cruelty was heartbreaking but the crowds who gather to watch shows, music and boxing are Moroccans not the tourists! The banter for the food stalls in the evening is great as they try to guess the nationality but again politely declining in French always received a smile back. Oh, and the orange juice (if it's freshly squeezed while you watch) is great!"

The first night was interesting, we had food at one of the stands- all of the guys trying to get you in knew Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsey and used phrases such as 'chillaxe' which was fun. The food was ok but found it a little bland but for the price, can't complain. Also, meat everywhere seems to be cooked very well so can be dry. The second night we had a walk through the stalls again and bought nuts and juice. The guy, Muhamed, from where we ate remembered us and although we were not eating he sat down with us and had a mint tea and a chat, this was nice and unpressured but some of the stands were overbearing. If you are on a tight budget it is great for food.I did not like being approached with monkeys and things. Some animals did not look like they were treated well which I find distressing."

It is definitely worth a walk around, but I found it much more enjoyable to sit on a room terrace and look at the view (we went to Cafe de Paris). As for entertainers, we saw a few snake charmers and people with monkeys, but gave them a wide berth as don't agree with the way they were treating the animals. Other than that there are the food stalls - which I would probably have tried if we'd had more time in the city - and other stalls selling things. I didn't need or want to buy anything, so kept my distance - the sellers don't hassle as much as I was led to believe, a polite 'non merci' and walking on does the trick, but if they see you show a glance at anything, then they're on to you. A shame because it puts you off browsing - in a more relaxed atmosphere I would probably have taken a closer look at their wares and maybe picked up a couple of souvenirs. Haggling only really works when you know what you want and have a good idea of its real value. The square is an impressive sight though, and the whole atmosphere of Marrakech is worth experiencing for something completely different."

I really can't stand snakes so I did fing it hard to go to the square during the day, however, you can skirt the edge and even go to some of the panoramic restaurants to watch the happening of the square. Also it's quite easy to find out where the snake charmers are by locating the large green umbrellas they sit under and listening for the music being played on the flute. Even for someone as terrified as me, it's worth looking - even from a distance. The evening however is totally different as certainly in Oct/Nov - there were no snake charmers at night. The square comes alive with food stalls which are fun, fast and furious but have to be experienced. Bands play at night and various other entertainers draw crowds. I do think you need to keep your wits about you at night, I certainly felt uncomfortable in the dark square away from the food stalls - but you just have to go and see this and experience it for yourself."

There's definitely an energy to Jemaa el Fna, and undoubtedly it's a must-see at night in Marrakesh as it's central to the Marrakesh identity (or so I gather). However, it does feel like a bit of a trap. There are loads of dancers, story tellers, musicians, snake charmers, henna artists, but be careful not to stand too long or engage, and certainly don't take any pictures, unless your prepared to shell some dirmahs.All and all interesting, but perhaps not worth the hype."

Also, buying 2 or 3 items helps your bargaining leverage.And of course, if a woman offers to give you a henna tattoo and you say no and asks to give you one for free, still say no. She'll invariably ask for money once the deed is done. At night the belly dancers come out - but incase you can't tell on your own, be aware that they're all men, dressed up as ladies, so consider that before falling in love. And when you gather around the musicians or snake charmers, know that you'll be asked for change at a certain point, for enjoying the spectacle, so make sure you have a few loose single dirhams in your pocket to appease the performers.

The smells, sights, noises...there is nowhere like it.If you are not a seasoned traveller then it can be quite intimidating (I have taken people with me & their faces on the first trip in are amazing!!)You will get approached by EVERYONE, snake charmers wanting to throw a snake around your neck, monkey trainers offering to take a photo of you with their monkeys, water sellers, dancers, lots and lots of Ladies with henna (if you don't want henna, keep your hands in your pockets, they are clever at getting a bit on!!) Of course, they all want money. And watching from afar, they tend to do their bit first (ie offer a photo opportunity) then demand a silly amount of money from you. (water sellers ask for around 200dh - \u00a316 at time of writing) The tooth puller/dentist will let you take one photo for 20dh - \u00a31.60 - but just one!! Stall holders will only let you take photos if you either pay them, or buy something. Don't try and sneak photos, they have eyes in their bums and will rush over demanding payment. (Frightened the life out of my poor old mother)Personally I don't agree with using animals like this for entertainment purposes so if they approach me I simply do not make eye contact and hold my palm up toward them, seems to do the trick. Do not feel obliged to put money in the hat of the bloke that's just done a quick wiggle in front of you, just walk round him and resist eye contact.If you do decide to tip, they remove the tip, look at it in disgust, and ask for more :) We watched many a tourist dig his wallet back out.That sound so negative, but if you are willing to open your mind and enjoy the culture, it is a fascinating place with the most wonderful charactures.Grab a mint tea in one of the many cafes with a terrace on the roof - just walk in, no one waits to be seated. Make sure you have a 1dh in your pocket though if you need to use the loo, you are still expected to tip the loo-lady even if you have bought a meal or refreshments. (And carry a pack of tissues ;) )If you settle in one of the cafes around 3.30/4pm, you will catch the food stall setting up for the night. This is a treat, watching them come to life and start serving food to locals and tourists, however, I have never been brave enough to eat at one of them, having seen the bucket they wash the dishes in ALL NIGHT!! Always haggle in the Souks. I have never paid more than half for items, but don't start haggling unless you really do want the item, they don't like time-wasters. If the price is too low they will let you walk away, 9 times out of 10 they chase after you, inviting you back for another deal. It could take 15 mins to buy one item, but persevere and you will get it at a good price.Also, do check out the sellers that set up on the pavement, they can be well cheap, I got a candle lantern for just 20dh - \u00a31.60.If you enter the souks, don't fall for the old (This way is closed) line, once you start hovering and looking unsure you will end up with someone walking beside you, and steering you \"towards the Square\", you will get there yourself eventually, if you go with the \"friendly bloke\" he will expect a good tip ;)If you really are lost then barter with someone to show you the way, never go with them without fixing a price first or you can get lumped with a large bill. Ask, if they say 50dh, offer them 20dh. If they say no, walk away, they will soon chase you for that 20dh. And don't pay until you have reached your destination. Above all, always look confident, even if you do not feel it. It gets you a long way.Enjoy."

So with lots of avoiding eye contact going on, it was sort of sad, not an experience I enjoyed.In the evening we strolled through again, and there were hundreds of food stalls set up. We had a mediocre appetizer at one place, but didn't have dinner because we had planned a dinner at a noted restaurant, so we can't really judge the food there.Maybe the Jemaa is more lively at different times of the year, but all in all we were very disappointed in the experience."

Quite a number of locals go to listen to small bands and story tellers and to eat from the street stalls. That said, the place is overwhelmed by tourists, hence the tackiness, so it is hard to feel that you are in \"authentic\" Marrakesh and when you sit down to eat at a street stall you could just as easily be in Dusseldorf as Morocco.

There was absolutely no police presence. For such a famous place I think that the Moroccon police should be there to help tourists from these minority of thugs. This is a pity as these people give Morocco and its peole a bad name. The square is great but just BEWARE. If you want to take a photo go into one of the coffee shops that have a balcony and take your picture from there. Its safer."

Some of the bad reviews don't surprise me as the culture there is completely different to the western countries so you'll either love it and appreciate it for being so different or you'll hate it. Here's a few tips for those travelling from western countries:1) Do not ask anyone for directions, you'll be taken on the longest route ever and then asked for money and most likely you won't get away until you have paid. Instead ask staff at riad to show you way to the sqaure if you feel the need or look for signs, symbols, shops etc on the way to the riad which may help you to locate the riad in case you struggle to find way back. 2) Don't feel sorry for the children begging and asking for food, these children aren't poor, its just a way of earning some money and getting free dinner.3) Do stop to take a look at the men with monkeys and snakes, but as soon as they look at you, ignore them and walk away and do not look back or feel guilty for walking away. Certainly do not start taking pictures as you will end up paying money for it. I tend to stand far away and take pictures.4) Do not eat from the food stands at night or cafes in the square as they're a rip of and food isn't that great. Instead search for smaller restaurants away from the main square where food is tastier and cheaper.5) Don't start negiotiating on prices unless you really are interested in buying that item and start bargaining with a price much lower that what you want to pay.6) For lone females, avoid staying in the square after 10ish at night if you don't have a male with you or aren't in a large female group as you'll get a lot of funny looks from some weird characters."

My main thought is that it was busy, you didn't get the opportunity to browse without being harrassed by women doing henna tatoos, men with monkeys, people offering horse drawn carriages around the town, restaurant staff trying to get you to eat in their restaurant. It was all a bit of a sensory overload, but a must see place!I wouldn't rave about the restaurants there, it was fast food Moroccan style - 'rack em up and get em out'. My kids love pasta but it was something we steered them away from in Morocco as it was usually pretty poor.The other unnerving thing in Marrakesh is the number of people wanting to show you the way to somewhere for money. They walk very quickly so you don't really known where you were taken and we were even approached by a friend of our \"guide\" who also wanted money for some reason! Don't be fooled by the older gentlemen telling you their wife works in your Riad - she probably doesn't and they want to take you on a tour and get paid for it. They take you in with this line and you generally feel obliged to go with them - don't!"

The 'place' is not to be missed and is as others have described in prior reviews. I would recommend getting there for 6.30 and take a drink at one of the cafe roof terraces whilst watching the sun set. Do check first if you want a cocktail as not many serve alcohol within sight of the mosque. The colours are amazing and you will see the square transform as the evening sellers set up their portable kitchens and wares. We ate twice in the market square on benchs and took in the atmosphere. The brochettes (kebabs) are excellent, as is a plate of freshly cooked fish and seafood. You can eat very cheaply and well there but I would advise you to find seating away from the outside aisles as beggars will constantly be pleading for food. Very distressing, especially when they are elderly. We made up filled rolls with the remains of our meal and gave them to the needy who are really grateful. You will be approached by the food vendors to go into their particular portable restaurant but generally it is done in good humour and a simple 'we have already eaten' will suffice. We liked number 22, good food and nice characters. When you have eaten, wander into the souk and have fun bargaining. Beautiful shawls, kaftans, shoes and rugs etc. Lovely leather pumps for c.\u00a36. Starting price was \u00a318. It is a great experience but can also be tiring so wear comfy clothes. All in all it is an intoxicating place."

As I read in another review, Jemaa el Fna is a magical place. No words or pictures can describe it. You must live it. You must smell it, hear it, feel it in your body skin\u2026yes, you may feel it in your skin\u2026the snakes rubbing your neck and the heat attacking your body as the sun gets hotter and hotter.Things you can\u2019t miss at Jemaa el Fna: a) Drink an orange juice, they are delicious. We drank several but the stand we liked most is number 38. Sellers are usually very nice. Don\u2019t be scared if they shout at you. They are just competing to get your attention.b) Take a photo with one of the \u201canimation teams\u201d that \u201cwork\u201d in Jemaa el Fna. We have chosen to take a picture with snake charmers. You may feel harassed by them, but don\u2019t take it as an offence. If you don\u2019t want to take photos, just say it politely. They will leave alone. But you must say it two or three times \uf04a And I advise you to discuss prices before taking pictures. c) See it at night\u2026 It\u2019s incredible how the square gains an extra energy from 4pm till 1am. Food stands begin to organize their places and at night it\u2019s an incredible show. The smell of the different foods, the sounds of people advertising their stands, the music from dancers\u2026 You have to live it. Me end my wife didn\u2019t have the courage to eat at the stands\u2026but many tourists do it. I regret not doing it.d) Have a nice and peaceful meal in one of the several terraces of the square\u2019s many restaurants. See my reviews about them (Caf\u00e9 de France, Terraces Alhambra, Caf\u00e9 Glacier)e) Buy some souvenirs from the stands that exist around the square. The souks offer much more products but buying in the square is also a good deal. I did it and my barging made me save 500 DAH.If going to Marrakech, don\u2019t miss Jemaa el Fna.Visit it during daytime and feel it at night."

The horses / donkeys were clearly distressed and looked malnourished, dehydrated and had scars on their hides where they had been beaten. Moreover, there was an intoxicating smell of horse manure throughout the medina. We saw birds that had had their wings clipped for entertainment and monkeys in shackles being paraded around for photo opportunities. The men at the medina often tried to push monkeys onto tourists and place snakes around shopper's shoulders to create money making photo opportunities (this happened to our friends. They were told to pay 150 dirhams (\u00a313). When they refused, they were surrounded by 5 Moroccan men and were forced to hand the money over).There are lots of beggars: from the very old to the very young and the severely disfigured. After a few days we became aware that the children who were running around the medina begging had to hand over their money to a large \"Fagin\" like man. Terribly upsetting. Also, if you're white you are going to get ripped off. We speak fluent French but despite that the prices where inflated 10 fold. For example a shop owner tried to sell a cheap metal tea pot and glasses for over 1000 dirhams. When we attempted to haggle and told him that a Moroccan friend of ours had advised us we should pay no more than 100 dirhams, he became very aggressive and confrontational. We have haggled in other countries (Iran, Italy, Egypt, Turkey) and have never experienced this level of animosity,"

I am in my 20's and took my mum with me and being two blonde female travellers I wasn't sure what to expect!It was a brilliant, brilliant experience all of your sense are awakened and it really is a sight for sore eyes.On our first trip to the square we went around the souks with a guide who we picked up at the entrance to the main square, for a couple of quid he took us around and helped us get our bearings in the maze that is the souks. After a morning walking through small winding alleyways coming out into light airy courtyards with merchants selling spices, art work, jewellery, clothes and food and the rest we were navigated back through the cool shade of the souks to the Jemaa El Fna. You have to dodge mopeds, avoid stepping on snakes or cuddling a monkey on the way!I would recommend the fresh orange juice you can buy and going up to one of the restaurant roof terraces at night. Another tip would be as the sun goes down you can take all of your photographs of the square's activities from the roof terrace to save some of the hassle.Talking of hassle yes you do get approached and asked to buy things, eat things, get tattoed, hold monkeys, kiss snakes etc etc, however if you remain laid back with a smile on your face and politely say no thank you if you don't want to participate you are met with a your welcome, a smile or welcome to Marrakech back. We never had a bad experience always kept a sense of hunour and immersed ourselves in the culture.I personally always covered up when I went to the square wearing long dresses and taking a shawl this was to show respect and also to make myself feel comfortable. I did see tourists in all states of dress but as women I feel that you do get alot of attention anyway so if you don't want to add to that then dress to suit the area your in.The food stalls were also part of the experience, I had to persuade my mum to try them as she is used to fine dining more than I am but she loved the atmosphere the fast food that was mouth wateringly tasty and the excellent service. We went to food stall one alot which I would recommend and they do love it if you visit more than once, we ate tangines, cous cous, kebabs, salads, vegetables and dips and no one that we ate with or took there ever had a stomach complaint. Also they cater for any tastes and we had a vegetarian woman in our party one night who asked what they did for vegetarians to be presented with a feast of vegetables and cous cous etc all for under \u00a35.This is a great place to meet new people, experience marrakech and is also a gateway to book tours, or get guides and information.

I have a few favourite stands to eat at, and as i speak fluent french and some arabic have now learnt a lot about how the 'business' of the 'Place' works. Plenty of tourists wander through but never stop and eat anywhere. Life is tough for the guys on the stalls. Tourists wander through and gawp, and get hassled to stop and eat, its worth being aware that the average wage for the night (4pm-1.30am when its all packed away) is 80dh... buy the macaroons from the children, their mothers' make them and for the sake of 2dh a piece, they are delicious, and the smiles of thanks are worth it. Be aware that if you don't finish your food,please give it to the people who beg, who are often ravenous, and if they don't want it and want money instead, draw your own conclusions! If you want to do something usefully charitable seek out the lentil stall next to no 12 - he supplies food to the many that can't afford to eat, and give him some dh for his efforts. Try the delicious' the epices' spice tea - bloody amazing, and will sort out any colds you may have! As mentioned above ref to snake charmers and story tellers beware the cost of taking a photo - and women beware the groping in the story telling groups! If you look like a tourist expect to be treated like one is the most useful advice I can give, and showing flesh is an open invitation, whether you approve of the culture or not.. If every toursit who visited marrakech actually ate a meal on the 'place' we could make sure that this amazing experience continues. It would be a tragedy to see a McD's there!"

The food was amazing, our riad was gorgeous, the architecture was beautiful and the people were beyond nice. Well most of the people were beyond nice. When dealing with people in the Jemaa el Fna square, do not make eye contact and ignore them unless you want to pay for something. If you are interested in taking a picture, getting a henna tattoo or seeing the monkeys - ALWAYS negotiate payment first.Here's what might happen if you don't take precaution. When we were walking through the Jemaa el Fna, we saw a couple of snakes about 20 feet away. The snake charmers were sitting behind the snakes but seemed to be on break. No one was near the snakes and they were not in the middle of a show so I snapped a quick picture. A man approached me waiving his hat in my face demanding money. When I said I had no money, he grabbed my arm and would not let go and started waiving his hat again. I kept saying \"Sorry I did not realize the rules and I will delete my picture\" and started to delete the picture. He then began to drag me through the square at which point I loudly stated that I deleted the picture. He lightly shoved me and then walked away.Later that day we were approached by women that did henna tattoos. We repeated \"No, merci\" and kept walking. One girl grabbed my hand and would not let go. She started drawing after I repeated numerous times that I had no money. Her two friends then started grabbing at my boyfriends pockets while she held tight to my arm. My boyfriend quickly grabbed his wallet to try and keep it out of reach of the women. To show them, he opened his wallet to show that he had no Euros or Durhams and that he only had a $20 USD. The two girls grabbed the money out of his wallet and turned away before he could do anything. Once we got to the food tents it was great, the path to get to the food was an adventure."

The food is excellent no matter which stall you eat at. its all down to how each of the vendor entice you into their piece of Jemaa el Fna. Don't be afraid to tried the food its fresh tasty and cheap - but try the mint tea after your meal.If you haven't visited other poor countries you may find the square overwhelming but nothing fazes me after Cairo and turkey (then again i am born and raised in Kashmir). Ignore them and they will go away, I tend to wave my hand, shake my head and say no firmly and they go the message. Just be courteous and they will leave you alone."

Do try out the tagines at the proper restaurants that surround the square. You will know what you are compromising. We found the tagines at the restaurants superior to the ones at the street stalls. One might roll their eyes and think...well, of course! but that is not true for the kebabs and the desserts we ate at the stalls. Do watch out for your wallet. Do not hold anything someone is trying to sell you...before you know it they will not want it back and will ask you to pay for it hahahhaa (oldest trick in their book)."

See my photo of the menu and prices of stall number one. It is what it is, but I couldn't have eaten an entire meal at a stall as it was rather cramped and uncomfortable. Stall food is not my cup of tea but it was for many as they were very busy. The henna tattoo ladies come running over to show your their patterns but I dislike henna at the best of times and Indian Henna is a better colour. Little children beg for money and try to sell you tissues. Please try and remember many of them are poor, they are just trying to make a living.If people haven't visited other poor countries they may find the square overwhelming but nothing fazes us after Cairo and Istanbul. Ignore them and they will go away, I tend to wave my hand, shake my head and say no firmly and they go the message. Don't make eye contact. I was throughly dismayed at seeing all the animal cruelty, illegal poached animal skins and eggs. The monkeys were on chains which they deliberately kept tight and they look distressed, please avoid having your photo taken with them as you only perpetuate their trade and the animal suffering. The snakes were handled badly and I imagine most live a miserable existence. If you do stay in the Medina area of Marrkech, and you love cats and kittens then i'd take cat biscuits/treats. The incense smell in the square irriatated our eyes and my partner's nose. The drumming beat sound gave me a headache and I didn't find it mesmerising as other posters have said. The motorcyclists were everywhere so you need eyes at the back of your head to avoid collision. All that being said we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Marrakech."

Number 117 was were I ended up most time, but had to try a little bit of food from each.Having been approaced by a couple of guys, I settled down at one stall, I think it was number 44, really nice meal. As soon as I had finished and got up, the guy from the next stall, number 21, tried to persuade me to go to his stall. I told him that I had just eaten, he had seen me sit dow, and that I would eat at his stall either later or the next day.His friend also working on the stall started calling me a liar. He then asked me where I was from, I said London, he said all English people are liars and are 'people of questionable birth' (my words). I had never had such comments in all my visits to Marrakesh. I told him that perhaps I would not be visiting his stall.The next time I passed stall 21, I saw them giving abuse to an elderly couple, also English, He was saying if I or they ever eat at his stall he would spit in our food.So, a warning to all, stall 21, watch out.Other than that, the other stall where great.And the orange juice stalls were great also"

Make sure they turn it on, just refuse to get in, if the driver doesnt turn it on or says it is broken. Trips will usually cost less than 20MAD.For big taxis, i.e. the Mercedes, the price has to be arranged before you get in, they will usually require more, so smaller taxis are to be prefered. Taking taxis from the Airport: Here the stuff written above doesnt apply, take the bus into town and take a taxi from there. If you take a taxi you will get ripped off. It will be about 20 MAD per person with the bus, but it will be cheaper."

It is such a great experience and is a lot of fun haggling, trying the different foods and people watching. Be wary of the women who try to do Henna tattoos though. Try to keep your hands away from them at all times. It is also great fun when the Moroccans dress you up in their traditional gear. They dont want money and they are not trying to get you to buy anything, they are just being friendly. You will also get offered in for Moroccon Tea practically everywhere you go. They are just being polite but you can still decline.Also be wary of men offering you marajuana. I was told by the hotel manager that more often than not the police are in on it and once you buy, the police swoop in on you. They kept pestering my younger brother and friend, following them through the streets but you just have to be very firm.Also be wary of the snake charmers and the men with the monkeys. The snake charmers will just place a snake on you and expect you to pay them money to have it taken off. Luckily I did not have this done to me but I seen it all too often with niave tourists. As for the man with monkeys,they will do the same but I would never give them money in a million years as they drug the monkeys and they are kept in the smallest cages all day in the square. It is such a sad sight.more often than not the people are genuine but it does become very hard to tell the genuine ones from the ones that are just after your money. You will be approached constantly asking where you are going, they will insist on taking you or showing you another place you can visit and it is very hard to tell whether they are genuine and dont want your money or are just after your money. It did get annoying at times so if you dont want to be led away, just tell them no straight from the start.But all in all it is a great experience and I cant wait to return next year!"

The central point is Jemma el-Fna square that is adjacent to the extensive medina. There are many souks around Jemma el-Fna so you can do a lot of shopping there. Remember to haggle, though. The most unusual experience starts after dusk when Jemma el-Fna turns into probably the largest open-air restaurant. There are many strange things to eat (like sheep brain) but you can definitely find something for yourself that is edible by European standards. Don't forget to get a cup or two of freshly squeezed orange juice from stalls all over Jemma el-Fna. The place is truly magic and you can feel it with all your senses."

Take your time and listen to the sounds of the snake charmers and their horns, and the horses, and the water sellers. When the sound overwhelms you close your eyes and ears and take a deep breath, the smells are a story in themselves.Make sure you have a good zoom on your camera as ypou can take alot of pictures from this great vantage point without the hassle of paying the objects of the pics..i.e watersellers, monkeys, snake charmers, cymbal players etc. I dont mind paying, but sometimes you dont even have them in the picture and they are still quite aggressive being paid. When all of the lights of the stalls have come on, take yourself off to have some real dinner at one of the stalls. I choose one with alot of smoke coming from it... dont know why. Basically they all offer a good deal and the food is fresh and tasty. After the meal take a slow walk around the square and then wander home to your riad."

It really is that simple. At any time we got aggressive behaviour. When we would stop to watch or take pictures of dancers or musicians, someone would come straight away with a hat asking money and 5-10dh was all they got. Once they even pulled me to middle of the crowd and let us take pictures with one of the dancers without asking for more change. During our 8 days stay in Marrakesh we had always dinner at #114 (except when we had a lovely dinner on the desert). At the 2nd night we tried #97 and we wanted to try tangia. The waiter told us to take a look how it looked like and when we were ready to order, they told us they didn't have tangia any longer. After being ignored a couple of times we made our way quickly to #114. They are all such friendly, funny and caring people always with a big smile on their faces.

As we entered on the left, a local guy on a moped pointed to the right-hand side and, although we didn't catch what he said, he said it was the last day. We assumed it was some local craft market or something similar and headed in that direction, thanking him for his help, while he set off in the other direction. After walking for some minutes, we were unsure which way to go and he turned up again and pointed out the way, this time walking with his moped and chatting to us in broken English. He was telling us about the \"tanneries\" (which must have been the \"word\" we couldn't work out initially) and he took us through a door in a wall and introduced us to another guy inside, who gave us a large bunch of mint to use as a \"gas mask\" as the smell was horrendous from the animal skins etc. After showing us around the numerous concrete \"baths\" containing skins (and I'm not sure what else), he took us across the road to a shop selling leather goods and carpets and introduced us to the owner and then left. We were shown the different types of leather and some carpets but we told him that we couldn't take any home, as we were restricted to weight and capacity (Ryanair!) As we left the shop the \"Tanneur\" appeared again and pleasantly told us that he would direct us back towards the \"square\", for which we were grateful as we had lost our bearings. As he took us along an alleyway, he suddenly stopped and demanded 100 dirhams. We told him we hadn't asked to be taken to the Tanneries and no-one had even hinted that there would be a charge but he turned quite nasty and repeated his request. My husband offered him some change but he gestured towards my husband's pocket and said he wanted notes. When my husband said he didn't have any notes, he was quite threatening and told us not to mess with him. I started walking off ,hoping my husband would follow but he was trying to reason with the guy and, as I got further along the alleyway, I noticed another guy at the exit and assumed he was associated with the \"tanneur\" My husband followed me a couple of minutes later and said he had given him 30 dirhams in change and walked off, without giving him chance to object. This was a scary experience as we didn't know what these guys were capable of and it was all done so slickly - the guy on the moped went off in the other direction, so no alarm bells there but he was obviously following to direct us when we took the wrong turn and, once the tanneur had taken us to the shop, he appeared to leave but was obviously waiting outside to \"show us to the Square\"."

Everything has a price in Marrakesh and although I enjoyed posing for photos with some of the square's more colourful characters they expected of course to be handsomely tipped. Also if you stop to give money in this way to one, you are immediately surrounded by a gaggle of other hustlers. As a female I was particularly targeted by the henna tattooists and these women (always in scary face veils) were a real nuisance and I had to be very assertive with them to make them go away.At night the place becomes a huge open air eatery with fewer people pestering you, but the burnt barbeque smells were too unappetising to persuade me to eat there.

Never, ever show paper money, only stop and watch if you have small change you don't mind paying. Also, animal lovers may find the treatment of the animals distressing. We avoided the monkey men like the plague, and we were distinctly uncharmed by the snake 'charmer' we saw trying to force a cigarette into the unfortunate creature's mouth.

If you stand still in the square to look at anything you will be approached.On the negative side-the traffic while fun to watch takes some dodging.I had expected lots of snake charmers but saw only one but lots of men playing the music.Some of The henna ladies are quite aggressive so be assertive.The banter from the food stall men is on the whole good natured but the odd ones can get a bit too much"

Coudln't believe that noone had warned me about this tourist trap. Some might call it authentic, charming, magical - I call it a complete scam where even little kids are taught that money talks. Once you get to the food stalls, it gets even worse: every where you look you see pushy men that have only one goal: to get as many people to eat on their stand as possible - using every sleazy trick in the book ranging from giving you cheap compliments to trying to woo you with their 3-word language skill in every possible language. Once you show no interest you'll get a big serving of ugly swear words and pretty evil looks thrown at you...very hospitable indeed. The only light amongst this mess was stand 114 where we actually found a good guy who sold pretty good, honest food. If this had been my only encounter with Marrekesh, I would never go back but fortunately the experiences I had aftewards made up for a bumpy start."

Jemaa el Fna is a big, grubby rip-off. I spent 10 days in Maroc, and loved every minute of it until I got to this hideous square, and my whole impression of the nation dived thereafter, which is wrong, because thankfully most Moroccans are not as mean-spirited and deceitful as those that inhabit the area in and around this hell-hole known as Jemaa el Fna. I've travelled extensively in India, Egypt, Thailand etcetera, and I know an interesting cultural hot-spote when I visit one - and this square does not qualify. Avoid it! It's sad example of how global tourism can sometimes create horrid, monstrous places... Unfortunately Jemaa el Fna pretty much tainted my over-all impression of Maroc.

Today's Jemaa el Fna is a very rough place, intimidating to say the least and not in a good way. The cultural outbursts that once were spontaneous and genuine are now clearly a facade put up for tourists. In fact, the most impressive act on the square is how these people manage to get money from tourists for not doing much at all. Just crossing it at least five people will yell at you to drink their orange juice, give them money for looking at their snake for two seconds or visit their overpriced hammam. It broke my heart to see those poor monkeys, chained on tourist's shoulders, before returning to their miniscule cages. Of course, those tourists should be ashamed of themselves too. The sad thing (for me AND them) is, I would happily have spent some money there to see a genuinely good act or experience real culture if the atmosphere didn't feel so hostile. They're killing their own business."

The experience is completely different during the day vs night. It is amazing how the open square fills up with restaurants offering exotic and/or delicious foods as soon as the day starts to fade into night. There are women doing henna, snake charmers, and dancers in the square at night. During the day there is an endless supply of souvenirs to explore in the souq. Be prepared to bargain hard if you want to buy anything and also to be followed and hassled by vendors as you pass. Our experience was that almost everyone was very friendly although they did get too close for my personal comfort at times. Don't be afraid to say that you are not interested and walk away if you don't want to buy something. Usually being polite will work fine although I did on a couple of occasions have to turn sturn to get someone to let me pass. It's all part of the experience though so I found it to be very fun and exciting. I came home with many interesting souvenirs and pictures. I also tried the food and liked everything I ate and didn't get sick. There were many tourists in this area so there didn't seem to be any need for women to be too concerned about dressing conservatively as is the case in some other parts of North Africa. Overall it is a really exciting and enjoyable experience as long as you are mentally prepared for the high level of stimulation and engagement from the locals."

Taking a picture of the square in general resulted in a hoard of mean-spirited street people decending- demanding that the picture was of them and they should be paid.Maybe this was something in the past-- now it appears to be coasting on its reputation---- as Medinas go, Fes was more interesting."

In the summer Jemaa is surely even more exciting.There are so many food stalls that it would be very hard to choose the best. It WOULD, but \"luckily\" there are some thousands of very keen waiters who are trying to get you in. When you finally give up and just follow some waiter to his stall you'll notice that there is almost impossible to get any kind of service because all the waiters are desperately trying to get the other new customers, and other and other.. And I think the food is not worth of taking a risk to get some disease. We tried three different food stalls and every of them was a disappointment. Luckily we stay healthy.Even if you'll have only one hour to explore in Marrakech, you can't pass Jemaa el Fna. It's something unforgettable."

I had looked forward so much to being there, soaking up the atmosphere, being entranced by all that was different and new. I wish I'd read some of the reviews here before I went! The square is filled with snake charmers, musicians, story tellers, yes yes yes... But, as one reviewer put it, they are there not as a cultural expression of Moroccan identity anymore, but as a tourist attraction. Pay no more than 20dh for photos taken - they will try and demand 100, 200, 300dh, some of them will get very aggressive. And woe betide you if you sound American or English - if there are two prices for locals and tourists, then Americans and Englishmen are at the high end of the tourist spectrum. I expected to be inspired by Morocco, instead, I was too intimidated to take any photos in the square. We were hassled for money continuously, having to endure fez, monkey, snake, and henna being put on our heads, shoulder, necks and hands, all without request or permission. \"Laa shukran\" (Arabic for \"No thank you\") became a mantra, to be repeated over and over again, in the square, the souks, the medina. Say no, over and over again, then walk away if they get overly aggressive. If anyone follows you, say you'll call the police (there are usually some plainsclothes policemen hanging around the square). Ignoring people, although it feels very very rude, also works, but some may also curse and swear at you if you ignore them. Not a good feeling all around. There is some magic still in the Djemaa, most noticeably at sunset, but be prepared to be hassled and harassed by those that make their livelihood here."

It is like nothing else you will experience.Course you might not like everything\u2026but everything is not there for it to be liked. The square is very quiet in the day with a few entertainers and orange sellers but as soon as it gets dark (5.30-6pm at the end of October) it transforms. There are about a hundred food stalls all trying to get you to eat with them. Dont' take any photos of them unless you eat there otherwise they will shout at you. Most stall are the same selling chicken kebab, couscous, salad, sausages and frites and lots more all on display for you to see. Some have sheeps head and some are eggs which they fill a big bap type bread with egg and anything else you fancy. We went there with our two children age 10 and 7 who found the whole place out of this world and was never once bored. We decided on our 3rd night to be brave and eat at one of the food stalls. For 4 of us to eat with a coke each (no alcohol allowed) it cost \u00a316. BUT hygeine is not the best and thinking about it we took a big risk eating there. The food is brought in fresh but not refrigerated (not that it was hot when we were there) but they wash up in the same water all night. The next day my husband was very ill with diahorrea had a high fever and five days later is still suffering - doctor says he has viral gastroenteritis which is caused by poor hygiene. Luckily out daughters have not had it, and I have had a very mild dose. I would love to recommend eating there because the atmosphere is brilliant and the guys working there are pure entertainment. And out of 4 of us only 1 got ill. But think would you eat there if it was England and the guy who has just handled your food is also dealing with money washing the table down and shaking everyones hand.It was a shame because I loved it there - to me it is what marrakech is all about. But if you do eat there remember you are taking a risk and you might be ill."

I mean if you go to Marrakech and do not go to the Jemaa El Fna then I\u2019m telling you, you have so missed out.Course you might not like everything\u2026but everything is not there for it to be liked. I loved the place. Go for the orange juice, it is the best I have ever tasted I am not kidding so that alone contradicts the saying \u2018definitely worth not going/seeing\u2019.The food was lovely, most places had the same thing on the menu but it was dirt cheap, I recommend stall number 97 as they had the friendliest staff, they shook your hands and made sure that you were ok and looked after you until you have left their stall. Their food compared to the other stalls we have eaten in were more fresh and cooked right, it is also one of the busiest with tourists, so that shows number 97 must be one of the better ones. All stall have numbers so what you tend to find is that they will tell you to remember their stall number and come back for it later or another day. Yes, they are pushy and yes they want you to eat in their stall and yes, its Marrakech\u2026its all for themselves, the way they make their living you just have to join in and laugh it off and blend in with them it works, just be one of them and they will laugh back and make jokes! The big trick to these food stall workers is you PRETEND you have already eaten so then they will stop and just ask you to come back another day and remember their stall number, and they will smile and welcome you to Marrakech then leave you alone. Done.There is so much to see, henna artist calling you to come over and \u2018just look\u2019 but they will like you to actually do one. Just don\u2019t go and look if you do not want to do it, your just going to make them think you want one done and make yourself spend around 50 dirhams on henna designs which you did not want in the first place. So just don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t want it. Snake charmers, well they are there charming the snakes and they do offer to put one round your neck and take pictures\u2026no way I was doing that, then there are cute monkey which are being put on to your shoulders and the workers get them to pose for the camera which you have to of course pay for at the end. Acrobats and watermen belly dancers and performers are scattered around, be careful with these lot if you even look they will draw all their attention on you amongst everyone in the crowd and at the end will ask for money. Some will do nothing and will still ask for money. There are other things like fortune tellers, story tellers and much more. There are a line of horses and carriages and their owners asking if you want to go for a quick spin around the area with them. You will also find motorbikes zooming past you dangerously so be conscious. The square leads to the ever ending souks :).Personally I did have bad experience in the square, with people asking for money even though all they did was bang a drum 3-4 times; all we did\u2026 was give them 1 dirham and walked off. They still bothered you but just ignore and walk off, at the end of the day remember it is down to you how you will get treated there and how much you pay. There was one henna artist came up to me and showed me the henna book and forcefully took my hands and started decorating it, I was really cross, I wanted to save my hands for the last day so I can get a henna artist on the last night to tattoo it so when I come back to London it will last longer. I was not having it; :-( she demanded money for that forceful act. I was not going to give her anything. And I didn\u2019t. But like I said you will experience a few bad times but you expect that. You will get lost if your not careful so be careful! Keep an eye on your crowd in that way you will not be separated. Beware of pickpockets they do exist. Orange juice is the best 3 dirhams you get a freshly squeezed juice. With 10 dirhams you get orange and lime yum yum that is delicious you will need to try that as well. (Recommend stall 17).You will get beggers they are not \u2018horrible\u2019 as some people put them they just want a bit of help. I don\u2019t mean splash your money out, no don\u2019t do that, but use your instincts and look out for the ones you think will need it. We gave some of our food to a few children who asked they thankfully took it and went. There was an old lady sitting in the corner praying we gave her around 10 dirhams she didn\u2019t even look at the money to check how much we gave her and all she did was dearly thank us no matter how much we gave. There was an old couple the man was blind we gave them a few dirhams and they were so happy and appreciative, that\u2019s it we didn\u2019t splash hundreds out. There were a few annoying children that were sent by their parents trying to sell biscuits n wouldn\u2019t leave us alone. But we got through it with a help from locals.The Djemaa El Fna goes through a huge transformation from the morning to night. Wow you will see the difference, it\u2019s quieter in the morning but after about say 7 you will see the stall getting built and slowly music from snake charmers and drummers flooding the square and smoke from the cooking flying in the air and gets buzzing with people. What we done was sometimes buy a few soft drinks and water in a caf\u00e9 and sit there for few hours and watch and talk. It was really relaxing.So in conclusion a definite place to go. If you don\u2019t like the sound of what I said then don\u2019t go Marrakech at all. Because that is what Marrakech is all about, it is what you imagine from a North African/ Middle Eastern part of the world. Maybe Paris will be the place for you."

The orange juice stands are nice however and are really cheap, just make sure you ask the owner to press the oranges infront of you because normally they serve it out of a jug with pre-pressed oranges mixed with water.The so called amazing entertainment is a let down too, i saw a few snake charmers, and people with monkeys on chains that were clearly VERY badly treated - all for the tourists and a massive let down.

We found no hassles and were not groped. We felt completely safe in the city. We did dress modestly - long sleves and long trousers. Maybe that helped, but everyone else is covered up and it only makes sense. We ate at the night market - not the restaurants with the view on the market, but at the stalls. Each meal we had was delicious and the people were so friendly around us, especially at the soup stalls where few tourists were. Yes, there are beggars and yes, one asked for food. We didn't give money, but one cannot turn down another asking for food. Charity is good for you.Daytime - snake charmers can be a bit aggressive, but just don't give them the silly sums they ask for the couple of pics you'll snap. They'll argue and push, but so what. It's all part of the fun. Remember, 99% of these folks have never been outside of their reality and have no idea what westerners like/dislike and what makes us feel uncomfortable. So, just ride with it and enjoy."

            "review": "Different Day and Night. Once upon a time a group of 3 western women entered the square attracted by the music, bright lights and throngs of people. Almost immediately, having tried to edge into a crowd to see what was happening (storytelling), one was groped. The tall, slim, blonde and blue-eyed youngest? No! The squat dark haired fat-bottomed one! They like the ones with child-bearing hips it seems. We soon discovered an effective deterrant was to slap the intruding hand very sharply whilst shouting \"ne me touchez pas!\" and turning to face the perpetrator who usually slinks away. Sorted! The next step into the unknown was to dare to eat at the open air food stalls. Do it! Do it! Do it! The food is great, cheap, you will not get Delhi Belly and the young men are heaps of fun if you joke around with them. An easy solution for the beggar children (yes, they approach you) is to give them a sweet (bon-bon). They are usually delighted and rush off to devour them alone. During the day, the square is more tourist trap snake charmers, Berbers in fancy dress charging for photos and henna tattoo ladies. I had 3 tattoos done and it took me that long to find out the local price. It is 10 dirhams (and a packet of gummy bears) for a small tattoo on the foot and 50 dirhams for more involved hand or leg tattoos. One shocking women tried to charge me 400 and was told to go away in no uncertain terms - do they think all tourists are fools? Of course, all around the square there are western (tourist) restaurants where you can get a beer or bottle of wine and the many souks selling souvenirs. Before you even start haggling there, visit the complexe artesanale on Mohammed V which is govt fixed prices where you can see the craftsmen working. These are your top prices so do not pay more in the souks. The most important thing to remember is that you are supposed to be enjoying yourselves. Have fun, smile and the Moroccans WILL smile with you."

            "review": "Watch out for the gropers. A lot of people on the web had raved about Jemaa el Fna, especially the night attractions - snake charmers... dancers... theatre... It was the place to be! Sadly, it was anything but. Firstly it is always highly recommended that you go to one of the restaurants which overlooks the square and have a meal up on the balcony. Sadly, like most tourist traps, the food is substandard and generally a poor imitation of pizza or pasta.But the real disappointment is the so-called night time activity. One quarter of the square is given over to an evening eating area, and about two-thirds to brightly lit stalls selling very cheap trinkets or dates/orange juice (out of dirty glasses). And the 'magical' activity? What little there is all takes place on the darkest periphery of the square. As two western females in Morocco we were already aware that, no matter how old or how conservatively you dress, you are constantly verbally harassed (with sexual innuendo's) by Moroccan youths. So given all the entertainment was taking place on the darkets edges of the square, there is something very intimidating about plunging yourself into a dense crowd of Moroccan men in the dark. So we didn't.Finally we found a little puddle of light with a crowd no more than 2 people deep, and some Moroccan women at the centre which gave us enough courage to pause and try see if this was a snake charmer or a magician or something else.... We edged up to the back of the crowd and almost immediately, youths from all over swarmed all around us and within seconds, fingers were sliding up our backsides, down our arms, across our backs. We fought our way out and wandered around until we found another less crowded show. And the same thing repeated itself. We left in disgust. So if you are a western woman who wants to see these night activities in Jemaa el Fna, be prepared for some very intimate and disgusting groping from invisible fingers and hands."

Whilst certain things are true; you get hassled a lot in the souks, people do tend to stare, beggars approach you a lot, the city has a great deal of colour, culture, tradition and life. We spent about 70% of our time in the Jemaa El Fna and in the souks and each time learnt more and more. Marrakech isn't a rich city and the people do not live well - you will notice that Moroccans are very proud of their country and look after their own. We noticed many locals who were better off give very generously to the poor so what is the harm if you give a few dirhams too? There are times when you will be digging for change in your pockets a bit too often, I found that children supposedly leading the way - by leading, I mean walking a metre in front of you then stopping to ask for payment was rather annoying especially as we had not asked for the assistance, or dancers in the square who happen to be in your eyeline asking for cash rather cheeky but a firm no will see them on their way.Eating in the square is a must. The locals do it and if tourists want to get to know Marrakech in any way then they should too, if you find it too much then might I suggest somewhere a bit more sanitized - perhaps a beach resort in Spain? It is true that it is hectic, dusty, manic and busy but this is part of the city. It is not a city of sights but rather of senses and colours and culture. The cuisine is superb and a feast can be had in the main square.. we found the selection of kebabs, tagines, grilled vegetables, fish all to be fresh and very well flavoured and cooked. You will get the opportunity to sit with other tourists and locals if you're lucky and talking to them only adds to the experience. It is true that people do approach you asking for money or trying to sell things but the waiters and chefs are very protective of their customers and quickly shooed them off. We found that the more we went back to the square, the more we liked it. We were recognised more and more too which meant less hassling. Highly recommended!"

Marrakesh is a dirty dangerous city, the locals have one thing in mind ripping you off .The food is horrible the beggars hound you when you are sat eating in the square. On one night a man in a wheelchair was put next to us by a small child when I looked the man had a colostomy bag on full veiw !!! the child then pointed to it and held her hand out for money. Not what you want to see whilst eating.Taxi's : you cannot show the drivers an area on a map because they can't read we got dropped off in god knows where after 10mins I'd had enough tried to get a taxi back a driver wanted to charge us 200 dh the oringnal journey had cost 20dh. We just felt exhausted every time we went out it was constant hassle from large gangs of locals hidding in the alleys. and as for the motorbikes that's another story . Stay away from marrakesh !!!"

This makes the city hot and humid to walk about in. The ride from the airport to Gueliz, the new part of the city, takes about 15 mins by cab. All the taxi drivers told me it would be 150dh. Although it was only 100dh when I ordered the taxi back via the hotel!There are many sights to see and they are all explained in any good guide book. I found the Time Out book to be very useful. The real beauty of the place for me lies in the sounds,smells,sight and feel of walking around. The noise is never ending from traffic, people and animals. Crossing the road can be test all on it's own. You get to compete with cars,buses,mopeds,bikes,people,people on donkeys and most things that move. There is a right of way, but this gets easily ignored. Find a local and cross when they cross. The Souks provide their own entertainment. Clothes,food,livestock and more. You will get lost wandering about. Not too difficult to get back on track though.Jemaa El Fna has much to offer by day and night. During the day you can find the snake charmers.Around 6.30pm the food stalls start to set up. Here you can find all manor of goodies. Couldn't bring myself to taste the Pigs Head! The only annoying thing about the square are the boys who work the food stalls. They have picked up little phrases from tourists and spend most of the evening practising them on you. Nevermind. Cafe de France provides an excellent view of the square from the terrace. Away from the square there are many other places to eat. Grilled chicken,bread,olives 2 spicy sauces and a coke for 30dh. I walked the 25 mins from my hotel to Jemaa El Fna both during the day and night and back. I felt safe at all times. The area is well lit and very busy. Just take the same care you would in any city. Taking photos was never a problem. Don't point your camera directly at anyone and you won't have a problem. I'm sure a few Dirham will sort out any misunderstandings.I have no doubt that you will enjoy Marrakech. Get caught up in the magic and try not to but too many slippers!!!"

            "review": "A square with a difference!. My wife and I visited the Jemaa el Fna on a few occasions. We found during the day it was to some extent very different from the night.Many people gather in this area and it is a great experience. There are performers, henna artists, snake charmers and the list goes on and on and so many varieties of acts to see! Also from the Jemaa el Fna you can get access to the souks (about 20,000 shops in a maze like sorrounding!)The atmosphere is lively and very raw. I would advice you dont relax too much and stay on your guard. I do not mean we felt like our belongings were not safe or we were not safe but the fact that for many people this is an area where they will making their livelyhood. Therefore:- If taking a photo, there is a 90% chance you will have to pay something to someone. It wont be much maybe 10-30 dhirams- There will be VERY FEW but some people who will force you to take part and then expect money, e.g. a guy holding a monkey placed it on my shoulder, my wife took the photo and then he demanded money, and yeah he go a little loud and asked for 50 dhirams. He ended up getting 15 from me- Some people do not like appearing in any photos so be wary of this as this are not comfortable with it- If you are not interested simply smile and reply in French/Arabic/even English but do not do hand gestures or show disrespectA lot of this common sense and even a tourist picks up the pace and surroundings very quick.Overall its an amazing experience where lots and lots of tourists go. Theres things to buy, food to eat and entertainment to watch or even take part in. We very much recommend you visit the Jemaa el Fna and guarantee you will return!"

I appreciate Morocco Traveller's thoughtful, experienced review of Jemaa el Fna, yet also agree with the reviewer that his or her history has become a bit of a hindrance to enjoying it today. I went to Morocco for the first time in June 05 and could not have been more fascinated by the constant whirl of activity in the square. It was like a vortex of exotic energy, zooming this way and that, charming, beautiful, bizarre, sometimes a little scary, always intoxicating. Yes, the performers ask you for money; yes, it would probably be even more wonderful if they did not; and yes, the health standards of the open-air vendors probably don't pass muster. But honestly, as an American who had never been to a non-Western country before, I was still absolutely bowled over and would highly recommend Jemaa el Fna to any first-time visitor to Morocco, even though it is not what it once was (which I totally believe)."

I have been visiting Morocco since the late 70s (most recently a few weeks ago) and have seen significant changes to the Marrakech over the years not least to the activities taking place in the Jemma el-Fna. I too am coloured by my past and on each subsequent visit find it harder and harder to find the very thing that brought me here so many times in the 80s. With so many cheap flights now available to Marrakech - plus the undying interest generated by various journals - the city (particularly the Medina) has become distinctly over-touristed. How much more can it take?Some performers in the Jemma el-Fna (the snake charmers, monkeys, acrobats and \u201cGnawa\u201d musicians who perform during the day) have no doubt cashed in on this influx and see tourists as a major source of income. These performers have always taken the opportunity (and dirhams) to pose for tourists when it came along but in my view, the emphasis has now shifted.The evening shift on the Jemaa is slightly different however. The atmosphere is different. The circles surrounding the musicians and storytellers are mainly Moroccan and the place has a bit more of an authentic feel.I worry about Marrakech and the Jemaa el-Fna, it ain't the same. The very thing that made this place special is in danger of being lost forever (watch out Fes). Just read Juan Goytisolo\u2019s book \u201cCinema Eden\u201d. He puts into better words what I and others have tried to say."

It used to be one of the most amazing places in the world. I have watched it over the last four decades become more and more commercialized as more and more tourists \"discover\" Marrakech. There is still a certain magic to it, but the magic is tarnished by the over commercialization. Whereas in the \"old days\" you could roam around the plaza without any hint of being bothered by \"performers\" asking for payment, now, sadly, that is what it has turned into. The snake charmers are still there. The monkeys. The acrobats. The story tellers. Unfortunately whereas it was once done as a cultural expression, it is now done for one reason alone: money! The city should try to get it under control before tourists make a complete pass of it. The best thing about the plaza is the orange juice, still as fresh as it ever was. The food stalls have multiplied exponentially over the years and while the sanitation isn't the best, thousands of tourists eat at them weekly. I probably wouldn't anymore.... there are just too many other choices in the smaller restaurants on the streets leading away from the plaza. But I can't get enough of the orange juice! Sadly, Marrakech is becoming like so many other \"number one tourist destinations\"... I don't think there is anything that can be done about it. Still worth a trip to see it, especially in the evening, but not a must see destination anymore."

If you're staying in a riad (which is the only way you should stay in Marrakech - who wants to stay in a hotel that could be in any city in the world!), you'll more than likely get out of your taxi from the airport/train/bus station to here and then walk to your riad. Surrounding the square is the entrance to the souqs in the north, then to the south is the Koutoubia Mosque - which is off-limits to non-Muslims, but you can look at the exterior. Near the mosque, is the the starting point for horse and carriage rides should you want them. inside the square, during the day you'll see storytellers attracting a crowd, 'teeth-pullers' which appear to be the alernative to dentists should be desperate enough - but they will pose for photos with you.. .for a tip of course! I recommend getting to know money and tipping rates before you get here, because you could get seriously overpriced if you've just arrived. I had my photo taken with the snake charmer and held a snake on my lap and the guy tried to charge me 200 dirhams, which was a joke. 20 dirhams was perfectly acceptable and he took it. After initial meals in actual restaurents (such as Las Terrases de L'alhambra which was good) we ended up eating most of our dinners on the street stalls, which are set up after sundown. The food is v good, the atmosphere is brilliant and the price is v cheap, plus you're likely to make some Moroccan friends too. Day or night, you can't visit the Djeema without going to the orange juice stalls as often as possible. The juice is freshly squeezed and tastes amazing. There's tons of herbalists and women doing henna also. The henna women can be a bit too persistant and one actually started drawing on my hand when I said no so you have to be v firm and perhaps say \"la shokran\" which is Arabic for no thanks, and that should work a bit better than saying no in English."

Now all gone (except for the story tellers) to be replaced by dubious fast-food stalls and T-shirt sellers. So sad.
