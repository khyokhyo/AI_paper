The current exhibition of antique Chinese ceramics wasn't really my cup of tea but I was very happy to have visited. It's a beautiful space, and the Japanese garden is gorgeous and surprisingly big. I think it will be even more beautiful next month with the fall colours. There is also a very nice caf\u00e9 located in the garden. Admission to the museum is 1100 yen and you must buy a museum ticket to access the garden and the caf\u00e9."

The original buildings were destroyed during the war but the collection survived. The current building is worth seeing alone for the design and architecture. There are some amazing works in this collection and you will learn some cool stuff. It's very well presented. The buildings are encompassed by a calming garden containing more works. Definitely worth the price of admission!"

Nezu Museum sits on 20,000 sq.m. of sprawling site in Minami Aoyama and is home to Nezu Kaichiro\u2019s collection of premodern Japanese and East Asian art. Nezu Kaichiro known as Railway King whose career included being president of the T\u014dbu Railway started his collection with tea ceremony artifacts and expanded into paintings, calligraphy, ceramics, lacquerware and archeological treasures.This private museum is the perfect kick-off for the walking tour of Minami Aoyama, neighborhood of star architect retail shops, Italian furniture showrooms and cafes of all shape and form. Indeed the site is across the road from Miele showroom and doors down from B&B Italia and Flexform. It also just a few steps south of Blue Note for a quick swing-by with the 630pm gig if you\u2019re starting the evening early.Main museum building was designed by Kengo Kuma of Suntory Museum of Art (Tokyo) and LVMH Japan headquarters fame. The approach into the museum from the main road follows a cantilever covered corridor with bamboo fence on the roadside and timber wall on the other.The big, minimal Kuma signature roof line dominates the museum. Kuma\u2019s roofs are abstractions of traditional Japanese architecture, overhanging eaves shelter and shade from the exterior while creating a vast and lofty interior space freeing up imagination for function. Indoor ceiling is clad with long wood panels creating a sense of warmth and protection under the huge roof.Museum is surrounded by Japanese garden and duck ponds rich with trees and plants designed to reflect the four seasons. Lush bamboo groves boast its resilience in the coldest months keeping the garden green in all seasons. Four tea houses are dotted around the grounds are named and labelled on garden maps but not allowed entry.Small museum shop packs in more quality object d\u2019art than any of its peers from paper cards of all ingenious designs and shapes, traditional ceramics and lacquerware, furoshiki (traditional wrapping fabric) and of course coffee table books. Museum is worth the visit just for gift shopping. Just at the entrance of the garden is a glass encased, light and airy cafe (NEZUCAFE) serving Japanese style western meals (read pastry, salad and pasta)."

Please take no notice that hick tourist Sam, who wouldn't know a museum from a car yard... so many amateurs on here..The building is MEANT to be small, as if you took the time to read the background about the site, its a family bequest of the Nezu Family, the owners of the Tobu Railway) So its essentially a house/museum, that began with a purchase of a writing box (on display)The building designed by architect Kengo Kuma, intentionally, to be small.The mosquito infested garden he mentioned, dates from 1906, I guess they could have drained them of water, so that no elements of nature can affect the visitor, but then, its not Kansas, its the centre of Tokyo, and a beautiful respite from the traffic above. Ignore the ignorant, do yourselves a favour. Its a destination worth visiting"

We stopped by on a rainy day, and loved the gardens so much we didn't want to leave. Peaceful, calming and very beautifully architected, you'll appreciate the respite from the tall buildings and hubub of Tokyo at this little slice of heaven. It's not free, about the equivalent of $10 USD, but worth it. If you're a museum goer and like art and a beautiful landscaped garden, it's a must."

The place is really tiny and cramped, made worse by museum staff and all the security guards in uniform everywhere who kept getting in the way of the paying visitors as they tried to navigate the small space. People go to museums to enjoy art, not to have security guards in your face the entire time. Not much good art on display, either. Mostly Chinese art and many copies/reproductions of Japanese art.Tried walking outside in the surrounding gardens, but they were full of swarms of mosquitoes, probably because of all the stagnant water in the small ponds. Also very noisy outside due to the construction and cars/trucks driving by on nearby streets. Not recommended."

It's a modern building but definitely based in traditional Japanese architectural principles, and it's set in a traditional old Japanese garden with a tea house, and finding a garden large enough to walk in, and where you are permitted to walk, is rare in Tokyo. I also like that it is a relatively small museum so I'm not immersed for half a day or a whole day at a time. Lockers are available for 100 yen and that is refunded when you reopen your locker. I always come here when in Tokyo."

The museum is relatively small, but it has great treasures--the ancient Chinese bronzes are spectacular. When I was there in June 2016 there was a large exhibition of old mirror backs, which did not enthrall me and as a result, some of their famous paintings were not on display. The building is very distinctive, especially the entranceways and the glass exterior looking out to the caf\u00e9 and garden. Lunch in the caf\u00e9 is also delightful, particularly if you can sit looking out at the garden. The garden is amazing, extending much farther than it might seem at the start. Part of its charm and splendor is that you can't see all of it at once. It includes a pond, other water features, teahouse buildings, and a small shrine with statues. Very serene, varied topography. Loved it all!"

The museum is a nice building, and some of the exhibits were interesting, but it's quite small, and I wish more of the exhibits had been focused on Japanese design."

With meandering paths and ponds, you begin to forget where and when you are. The fragrant flowers and gurgling streams complete the transcending experience.I suggest arriving at 10:00 when the museum opens and walking the garden before the exhibits. This allows you to sit and slow your mind down from the chaos outside of the museum walls. I was greeted by a multitude of insects, turtles, fish, and birds; all of whom seem to embody the zen energy of the ancient statues surrounding you. As for the exhibits, I was equally impressed. The various works are well lit and carefully described. The galleries have a wonderful and cohesive flow to them- each piece earning its importance and giving meaning to a central thesis. It's rare that a museum has such an emotional impact, but I challenge you to visit and not lose yourself in its splendor."

To be honest the garden alone is worth coming here to visit, gardens like this are not so common in Tokyo. One reason it's such a lovely place is because it used to be a private residence and only became open to the public in the '40s.When I went, 3/24/16, they had a special exhibit on Buddhism, mostly silk painted scrolls that begin by showing the history of Siddharta, followed by receiving Buddhism from China, and finish in modern times when Buddhism synthesized with Shinto. There are English signs everywhere, written eloquently, for many pieces. This is the most English I have ever seen anywhere in Japan so far I think.The permanent collection is equally interesting, maybe more so. They have a small-medium size collection of ancient bronze from China, 11-13th century BC. I've seen these before at the Shanghai museum, but there are some pieces here that are in pristine condition and show some very intricate artwork.They also have a lovely collection of dolls, from the Kyoto imperial family. You can see how the emperor and empress dress by how the dolls are dressed; they are exact copies.I didn't go into the cafe but I'm sure it would be great, it was mostly full. The museum is not very big, but well worth a visit. My favorite in Tokyo."

The courtyard, in the center of Shibuya, is just amazing. You can find surprises also in every corner. The building itself is totally modern, however blends so well with the classical garden. You can spend hours there without feeling boring. The collection is totally amazing. Those huge bronzes from Shang Dynasty (you have to experience it yourself ....)."

Most well-maintained museum building I've seen, very modern but the art is not mostly statues, traditional paintings, antique pottery, clothing & calligraphy.The whole garden is beautiful to walk through, not a plant, pot or statue feels out of place and almost any part of the garden would make a good photo"

We took a long subway ride to get near the museum them walked with the aid of Google maps; it was easy to find but the sign outside of the museum is not so easy to spot. The museum is part museum and part beautiful garden. The collection of Asia art is displayed in large galleries with lots of air and space. The works are beautiful and you can take your time passing through the uncrowded galleries. There is a small caf\u00e9 in the middle of the garden that is perfect for lunch. We also spent some time just walking slowly through the garden to absorb the quiet atmosphere, really different from the atmosphere elsewhere in busy Tokyo. You can plan about one half of a day for a relaxing visit."

One must first pay for entrance to the museum, which is 1200 yen for adults, but the garden alone is worth it. Nezu was a rich entrepreneur who bought companies that were close to bankruptcy through mis-management, I suppose, and made them successful. He collected works of art to prevent them being taken abroad. There are places to sit (though not many) in the garden where one can hear the sound of a running stream and the sound of birds, but not traffic, and look at the delicate trees reflected in the still pools.The coffee shop is also wonderful, having glass walls that give the feeling of eating or drinking outdoors, in the garden."

I saw the \u201cSecret of Korin\u2019s Design\u201d exhibit and was very impressed with the high quality of pieces displayed, the excellent presentation and the more than adequate accompanying explanations in English.I was equally impressed with the very large Japanese garden behind the museum and spent as much time in the garden as in the museum. When I visited (Spring) the garden was a harmony of contrasting reds and greens. The beautiful pond with Iris (blooming end April \u2013 early May) is as beautiful as Monet\u2019s Giverny with its water lilies. This densely planted garden with antique statuary is well worth a visit on its own.With easy access on the Ginza, Hanzomon and Chiyoda lines (Omotesando stop), it\u2019s a great place to visit in the early morning before the crowds arrive. There are many affordable lunch possibilities on the side streets between the museum and the subway station.This visit is ideal for people who would like a small taste of Japanese art of the highest quality and who are interested in seeing an authentic Japanese garden. If you want a broader overview of Japanese art, I would recommend the Tokyo National Museum."

Because the garden is tucked in a little valley among the buildings and it entails a spring and little creek, the views (at ground level rather than looking up) are superb. Some of the creek crossings are made of big stones that are not always level but you can visit a large part of the garden even with a stroller. The museum itself is easily accessible and has a sizable elevator. The exhibited collection is small but of great quality.We did not find seating in the cafe on a sunny Sunday afternoon but after our visit we walked 5 min to Yoku Moku (see that review)."

I went to Nezu Museum on a cold sunny afternoon in February 2015.The museum exhibits only a small part of the collection at a given time. But what collections! The artefacts are well presented and amazing. Sure only a portion is shown but in many cases it is better to spend time on a few items than to what to see everything. The garden adjacent to the museum is a much a draw as the museum itself. It is small compared to most of the parks in Tokyo, but one can see it was carefully designed and presents a multitude of different faces depending on where you stroll. I liked most the small temple with bamboos at the top. Note there are several tea houses in the park but you need to book them ahead. Recommended place to get away from Tokyo busy life."

You can see skyscrapers in the background where crystal-clear stream flow underneath your feet.

This museum houses a huge collection of Chinese bronze pieces and other artifacts, paintings and calligraphy (7,400 objects).But by far, my favorite place of this museum is Nezu Kaichiro's garden where in summer you can see Tea ceremony professional gather and meet for private exhibitions in the garden many Tea Houses."

I have seen special exhibitions on both samurai swords and stunning Iris printed screens. There is also other rooms which display selections of their collection.However, in my humble opinion the best reason to visit this museum is to take a wander around the winding paths of the gardens and visit the tea room / restaurant. The gardens contain many artefacts from the museums collections as well as tea houses. The tea room / restaurant is (like to museum itself) a modern building designed by Kuma Kengo (who has designed the new V&A building to be opened in my hometown of Dundee, Scotland). I am no student of architecture but the spaces created are art in their own right.Well worth a visit after exploring the uber trendy shopping around Ometesando.Access: 8 minute walk from Exit A5 of Omotesand\u014d station of the Ginza, Hanz\u014dmon and Chiyoda subway lines.My Top Tip: Take time to visit the gardens and restaurant / tea room."

Only a small selection of the Museum's large collection is on display at any one time so depending on the timing of your visit you may or may not be lucky enough to glimpse one of Japan's National Treasures. I was very disappointed I didn't get to see Ogata Korin's Iris screen or see more Japanese works on display - the website makes no mention of which works are on permanent display. However, the Chinese Ming & Qing works being exhibited in June were beautifully displayed in this well curated exhibition. I was very happy to see the Buddhist antiquities and rare Chinese bronzes. I guess the key is that you can come back and experience something different with each visit.The stroll garden is quite a nice, verdant haven in urban Tokyo with Buddhist sculpture dotted around but the prevalence of strongly worded 'keep off' signs in English are too harsh and jarring with the Buddhist philosphy that permeates the garden ( a simple 'closed to visitors' would suffice on the signs). Disappointingly pathways are blocked and you can't really see much of the outside of the tea houses - sad because much of the Nezu collection has an emphasis on tea ceremony. There's a modern cafe in the garden but prices are high at around \u00a5700 a coffee - lots more choices down the street. The architecture of the Museum building is probably worth a visit alone."

This musuem/art gallery should be on everyone's must visit list and is in the Aoyama/Omotesando area. The museum/gallery building is very modern with a lovely entrance of bamboo, pebbles and concrete. The museum itself isn't very large and has two floors. The upper floor tends to house a permanent and somewhat eclectic collection of pieces owned by Nezu. The times I visited, it included a collection of very ornate gold antique clocks and some lovely ceramic urns. The ground floor tends to have different exhibitions every few months and the one I saw most recently was an exhibtion of hand painted wisteria and iris themed screens which I believe is an annual exhibition which coincides with the blooming of irises in the museum's garden.Even if you are not much of an art enthusiast, Nezu still has a lot to offer- in my view the main attraction of this venue is the stunning multi-levelled garden. Once you start exploring what it has to offer, you will be amazed to think all of this lies behind the Museum walls. The garden has ponds/water features, little bridges, winding paths, tori gates, shrines, an old traditional tea-house, stone benches and areas to sit and admire the view and numerous stone lanterns and buddha carvings of all shapes and sizes. It is heaven for the photographer, especially in Autumn when the contrasting leaves are amazingly beautiful. Recently the irises were in bloom in the pond and this also made for some lovely photos. If you have time, stop and have lunch at the cafe/restaurant- the food is reasonable but the view is stunning. The cafe building is very simple in its design, choosing to focus on the lovely garden views. It cost us \u00a51000 to enter the Museum and the average price of a meal at the restaurant was around \u00a51000 also. But on a weekend, be prepared to que for a table as it is not very large and gets quite busy.Nezu Museum is a good attraction to combine with a trip to Omotesando and Harajuku if you want to spend a full day there. On the way to Nezu, you will pass all the swanky designer shops like Prada and Comme Des Garcons which have either interesting shopfronts or are hosued in interestingly designed buildings."

Architect-of-the-moment Kuma Kengo's somewhat flat, yellow bamboo-dotted, straight-lined architecture is like all his other buildings, but it does house some genuine wonders, although shown around the year bit by bit. The gardens are conventionally inviting and can offer a tranquil, green getaway from the empassioned, frantic fashionability simmering everywhere on the streets outside, an area where what you wear seems to be who you are. There are three elegant and rather simple sukiyazukuri style teahouses in the garden, and several ponds, one infested with mosquitoes at certain times of the year. Still, on weekday mornings when there are minimal crowds, the garden can be a delightful place for a secret paper bag picnic while taking in the greenery and, according to season, many colorful azaleas. The teahouses are used by kimono-ed tea ceremony aficionados and their study groups and they get a bit possessive if you happen to pass by and want to have a look while they are conducting their little tea-in-slow-motion rituals. The interiors are worth seeing. The landscaping around the teahouses is a very typical example of Japanese gardening and quite inviting - if here and there just a tad...comment dit? ... precious. Nowdays the uniformed guards see to it you cannot enter the garden without buying a ticket to the museum, which wasn't always the case. I'd recommend you avoid the place during peak hours when too many people clomping by will ruin the ambiance. And do have your hotel check out what the museum is showing when you're in town. The Nezu owns some breath-taking national treasures but they are on display for limited durations, then replaced by more mediocre attractions. I have never found the staff working there especially gracious towards foreign visitors, whom they can tend to regard with tentative suspicion."

I was oriented to this situation after reading the TripAdvisor reviews so this experience lived up to my expectations. The museum is not hard to find as it is about a 450 km walk after turning right at the top of the A5 exit from the Omote-Sando Station. There is a sign when you emerge from the Metro exit to impart the confidence you are on the right track. The museum is at the end of the street and you literally walk onto the entry sidewalk as you cross the T-intersection. The cost for the museum is a little high (1200 yen). If not for the garden, it would not be worth it but I say that as one marginally interested in the type of art they display. Others may find the museum well worth it. There are six galleries in the museum featuring different types of art including ceramics and pottery (Japanese and Korean), sculpture (featuring mostly Buddhist pieces), bronze work and wood block painting (ukiyo-e). My favorite display in the museum, however, was the one depicting tea ceremony art and artifacts. This is uniquely Japanese and was, thus, something I could appreciate more than the other displays, though many of the pieces in the other galleries were quite lovely. I spent significant time soaking in the tea ceremony display whereas I surveyed the rest of the galleries stopping to admire select pieces that caught my attention. This kept my visit in the museum to an hour or so as I really wanted to get out to the garden, which was all it was purported to be. The garden grounds were sloped as one enters the green space. The loveliest arrangements are found as one descends to the bottom. Getting there, however, was very serene and relaxing, which is the major attraction to all Asian gardens. There are several notable findings in the garden including structures, sculptures and specific green arrangements. I spent as much time in the garden as in the museum. It is worth noting here was also a small restaurant on site at the garden entrance you need a quick refreshment. I did not sample the restaurant though it appeared quite nice from what I could see. If you like Asian art or Japanese gardens, consider putting this place on your Tokyo itinerary."

Many National Treasure and historical pieces were beautifully curated and exhibited. The garden behind the museum was much larger than I expected and what a sight it was! There is a beautiful cafe as you go towards the garden. Service and quality of food there is top class. As you walk down into this vast garden, you will see a few tea houses where they have tea ceremonies (check the website for schedule / availability as they are not in session everyday) and a lovely pond where there is an area of irises, when in season. You can see many jizou statues, beautiful landscaping and many types of vegetation throughout the property. I spent a good hour or so just roaming this lovely garden, very tranquil and an unexpected natural experience in the center of the city. I highly recommend it, and I personally would try to attend a tea ceremony next time I visit."

The Nezu has a small (and rather eclectic) permanent collection, but it is augmented by sophisticated temporary exhibits. The art collection belonged to the railroad magnate who gave the museum his name. The Japanese garden (with a lovely tea room) is an exquisite surprise in the middle of Tokyo, but we actually went for the architecture. Kengo Kuma is the architect and the perfection of details begins at the entry, with a walkway covered with stones (much larger than gravel) and flanked by a wall of bamboo. We saw a temporary exhibit of instruments for the tea ceremony. It was the kind that puts tears in your eyes because of the that goes into making a knot for tying a tea bag that then goes into a very simple and very beautiful box. I shall not repeat what others have said, but since we are interested in contemporary architecture and the Suntory Museum, also by Kengo Kuma, was closed for the preparation of a new exhibit, the Nezu remains a high point of our days in Tokyo. It is in Aoyama, on the street that continues Omotesando Ave., which is a display of both modern architecture and expensive designer shops. Everyone will tell you to not miss the Prada store (by the Swiss architects Herzog and De Meuron) but we preferred the flagship store of Comme des Garcons by Future Systems and the Dior shop, both by Studio Sanaa.and, of course, the Omotesando Hills Center by Ando Tadao."

On the way to the entrance you will already feel you are hearty welcomed by bamboo hedge. The museum building itself is not huge but well designed and petty modern. It is a comfortable contrast with a large and beautiful Japanese garden. Mr. Nezu, who had helped establish one of the most successful railway companies, collected mainly valuable Japanese pieces of art from 17th and 18th centuries. There are also some impressive Gandhra Buddha statues, ancient Chinese art etc. some of which are National Treasures. The most impressive one is perhaps a Byobu (screen) with Japanese daffodils / Irises. The museum\u2019s Japanese garden is worth walking through after the visit to this modern museum building. http://www.nezu-muse.or.jp/en/information/index.html"

The Nezu is an old museum--it opened just after WWII on the Aoyama estate of a wealthy art collector--but its gorgeous building is only a few years old. It was designed by Kengo Kuma and is not only an ideal showcase for Nezu's collection (which includes Buddhist statues, scrolls and tea ceremony implements) but an incredible window on its gardens, which are lovely and extensive. You'll want to spend at least as much time outdoors as in, since the gardens feature walking paths, a teahouse, superb statuary and a koi pond. There are also many wonderful trees. Although the Nezu is located in the heart of western Tokyo, it's possible to block out the city entirely and imagine a time when the estate wasn't surrounded by tall buildings. A must-see. There is excellent elevator access for those who can't manage the stairs, including an exit to the garden, although some of the paths have steps."

They could have built more rooms for exhibition instead of many teahouses in the garden, nice cafe or the hall on B1F. I would have easily given five stars if the person in charge were more keen on the idea that museums are meant to show and educate.I find it sad that many museums (or art in general) in Japan are privately owned and show only small part of the collection. Also, there is a bad tendency to invest money on building fancy galleries with no permanent collection- which is ridiculous, when there are enough such galleries existing. While the building of the Nezu Museum, or the Yamatane Museum not far away, are great, they could have put more emphasis on displaying their collections as much and as best as they can."

            "review": "Gem of a museum with a beautiful garden. This is a lovely little gem of a museum specialising in Asian art and artefacts. Whilst the great majority of visitors seem to be Japanese, there are signs in English at the entry to each gallery \u00a0with an overview of the items on display. The museum itself is not huge, but there is a garden out the back that encourages exploration, with various tea houses, ponds, waterfall, shrines and centuries-old statues dotted alongside winding paths - it was a lovely way to spend a sunny afternoon. There is also a small cafe on the grounds that affords a beautiful view of the garden. If you have time, I would recommend a meal there. The prices seemed reasonable and we very much enjoyed our afternoon tea in the tranquil setting. \u00a0The cafe was also popular with other visitors, and a queue quickly developed soon after we were seated, but they didn't have to wait long for a table.\u00a0Of note, too, is the walk to the museum from Omote-sando station. While the road itself, being not very wide nor shadowed by large buildings, has something of the feel of a backstreet, it is lined with big name stores (e.g. Prada, Cartier, Chloe, Issey Miyake) that quickly put paid to this impression. The Prada building was an architectural show-stopper, with bulging glass windows that covered the entire structure. I also loved the Japanese minimalist aesthetic and the interplay of concrete, wood and glass in the museum.\u00a0"

Two great exhibits: the Hina Miniatures of Meiji Emperor and wife, royal characters, samurais and pesants are precious and the exhibit of Japanese painting from the Edo Period (Irises on gold background) is beautiful. Some poetry on caligraphy can be also seen."

You can easily walk there from Omotesando Crossing...down the wonderful shopping street featuring designers such as Yohji Yamamoto, Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo- and the stunning Prada building is an architectural wonder! You may enjoy lunch with a garden view at the museum. It is perhaps the most \"Japanese\" of the museums in Tokyo. It does not feature Western artwork like many of the National museums in Tokyo- whose cur"

I finally checked it out and it was amazing. Try and go on a weekday and there will be few people. Probably only need to spend a couple of hours there but well worth it."

            "review": "\"New\" Nezu museum - quite wonderful. This place has recently (Oct 09) re-opened after a long period shut for refurbishment. The museum itself is lovely - fairly small, with regularly-changing exhibits. Everything's clearly labelled in English as well as Japanese, and the place is beautiful: a great example of how museums should exhibit their treasures.On its own, I'd probably give the museum three or four stars. But what makes the Nezu institute so special is the quite, quite wonderful garden. You can comfortably lose yourself amidst the tree-lined paths for half an hour or more, and it's truly beautiful. Quite unexpectedly, this place turned out to be one of the highlights of our Japanese trip: a real hidden gem, and very highly recommended."
