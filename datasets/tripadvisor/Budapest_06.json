Suddenly it was clear.. it was coming from the fountain, changing colours, the different twirly fountain squirts at the sound of music dancing, like magic! It was a lovely experience and we sat there spellbound, holding hands like other couples and enjoying a balmy evening in Budapest. I can recommend it! Try for extra romance!"

It is a long narrow 31 km island where many locals go for a peaceful retreat or to exercise by running around the island. We found it very pleasant to walk from one end to the other. However we did think it needed some attention to the gardens. Unfortunately when we visited workman were digging up areas around the fountain to lay pipes."

Later when we were leaving and passed by, the fountains were dancing to some Beatles songs so there is obviously a variety of routines.There was a number of benches/seats around the fountains.Though not in the same league as the dancing fountains at The Bellagio L V, these were very enjoyable, especially on a lovely summers day."

Yes, this might only be a fountain but it's more spectacular then anything I've seen so far. And once the music started, all of a sudden, and the water shot up in all sort of waves in rhythm to the music, I was really impressed.In the first round they played rock & roll, like the Beatles and Rolling Stones. About an hour later they played slow music, and I have to admit that once they played \"Time to say goodbye\" with Andrea Bocelli, I got tears in my eyes... it may sound lije a clique, but it was soooo beautiful. In the third round (yes, we stayed for around 3 hours) they played classical music. I also really liked the benches around the fountain. Each is for one person and are scattered around, some side by side, but others opposite each others. Something really different. And people danced to the music and dipped their toes into the water - simply a great place to hang out and meet with locals."

Because of their age we decided to travel to the island by public transport to keep the walking to the minimum. As UK pensioners my mother & friend could travel for free, my partner & I had Budapest cards which also have us free travel. The 261 bus goes on to the island & stops near the fountain. The 261 bus connects with No 2 tram close to the Margaret bridge. The fountain is entertaining when the music show is on which appears to be every hour for approx 15mins. We also hired 1 of the electric cars to explore the island, \u20ac15 for an hour which alloward us to discover the beautiful Japanese water garden at the other end of the island, but found the ice creams expensive at \u20ac5 each. See if you can discover how the island got it's name or why the locals call it Rabbit Island ?"

As a result, it is supposed to be good, but it is not.The first problem is brand-new seats that are attached to the ground. The fact that these seats are immobile could be ok if they wouldn't be randomly placed eveywhere. If you have a company of 5 people, then you will need to sit 10 meters away from each other. Most likely you will just end up sitting on the ground.Another problem is the fountain itself. Even that it is new, it is already partially broken. Some tubes don't throw water making the whole image of jumping waters wrong. Finally, the selection of music is simply horrible. Most of the songs sound like Hungarian music of 90s even that they might be new. It would be nicer if the music would be more international. At least, the music could be written by famous Hungarian composers that are known abroad but not that bad taste!All in all, it might be a great place for Hungarian standards. However, we (a couple) doubt that it can be very attractive for people from other countries."

Easy to reach by trams 4 or 6 as these ones stop at the island entrance on Margaret Bridge and the fountain is a few minutes walk from here. The evening music and light show starts at 9 pm and lasts an hour, while the music blocks during daytime are much shorter.

The second time we were wandering round the island and when it was getting colder, we decided to leave it and went along a stand, bought a mulled wine a had some rest by the fountain and then suddenly the performance started.

(she is Hungarian and lives in Budapest) However, I had the morning to myself and I decided to go check it out. I spent the entire morning on the island and had a little picnic lunch. It is just beautiful. The history is interesting, the gardens are beautiful and the island overall is so well kept. It was amazing to believe that this little island is pretty much downtown and walkable. The musical fountain was a nice touch. The only problem is I would not suggest it on a rainy or cold day."

Margit Island is not just the Music Fountain which is delightful..It is the feeling that you are miles away from the city...There are places to eat ,Or take a picnic..In the evening when there are special events what can be better than a hamper of Hungarian food and a bottle of wine.. On many days special musical events (Take a look at the event guide)..Stroll , sit and enjoy the beach like river front..In the evenings it is a romantic place whether you are 18 or 80 ..I have lived here for 10 years and never tire of strolling accross the Margit bridge and then taking the steps down to this delightful venue...There is so much to do and places to see here in the capital but try to find time to take those steps down from the Margit Bridge...You will not be disappointed.."

We spent an afternoon on Margaret Island (Margetsziget) and found the fountains close to the attractive memorial for the unification of Buda and Pest into one city.We knew of the fountains doing a dance to music but thought this was only a couple of times each day. In fact the fountains were dancing on the hour from 12 noon when we first arrived until 5pm when we left. We saw three of the performances - the final one being for children with Hungarian children's music. I understand that they continue after dark - which must be a great sight as others have reported here.The fountains are easy to reach by the tram which crosses Margit bridge and stops in the middle where you can find a slip road / path leading down from the bridge to the island. The fountains are behind a big roundabout (with the unification memorial in the middle). There are many seats around the fountain. It was delightful to sit in the warm sun and watch the waters dancing.We have been delighted with all we have seen in Budapest and this was one of the highlights."

What a great attraction, i found it to be mesmerising watching the water shoot up and down, making various shapes to different genres of music. Everyone seemed captivated. As it was a hot day many people were round the edges of the fountain dipping their feet in to cool off. The area is surrounded by greenery so makes a nice backdrop for a picnic. Alternatively there are chairs provided for you to enjoy the show."

We arrived at the beginning of a show; ended up staying there for a while. You could just sit by the fountain, dipping your feet in the refreshing water (it was super hot when we were there) and enjoy the moment. There are smaller shops around so you can buy a beer/water/soda and snacks. You can rent tucktucks and ride around the island as well."

He took us to Margaret Island on a perfect summer evening and we loved being entertained by the magical music fountain. There was a great variety of music (we watched the full set at 9:30) and the confluence of music and these beautiful colored fountains dancing to the tunes was truly wonderful. This is not to be missed!"

The music fountain located on beautiful and serene Margaret Island is something to see.During the day at several times it performs a magical water dance but at night is when it really springs to life with an exquisite and beautiful light show adding to the water dance. The light and water shows are both accompanied by a broad range of music so all ages nationalities and tastes can enjoy from classic Hungarian composers to the Rolling Stones to CCR to Verdi and Simon and Garfunkle to name a few. The schedule of music playing: every day is at 10.30 and 17.00 4 musical pieces, at 18.00 the complete music list is played, at 19.30 4 pieces, at 21.00 complete list againThe Music fountain is one of the main and best attractions on the island highly recommend spending some time relaxing by it with a small picnic basket and waiting for the show to start."
