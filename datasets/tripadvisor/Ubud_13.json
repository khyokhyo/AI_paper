I really loved the variety on offer at Neka, from photography to the Lempard collection, every piece is a standout. The descriptions accompanying the artworks are very helpful and definitely give you a greater understanding of Balinese culture and how the artists are influenced. Less refined than Agung Rai, but the grounds are lovely and the collection absolutely compensates for this."

So much energy has been invested in this museum I was very impressed. A really nice place."

The visitor is encouraged to walk through a series of galleries, starting with classical paintings and progressing to contemporary Indonesian art. One of the many foreign artists whose collection displayed in the museum are paintings by Arie Smit. The thing that makes this museum different from other is the collection of keris some people call it \"kris\" (an asymmetrical dagger blade with distinctive-patterning Achieved through alternating laminations of iron and nickelous iron) I think it has the largest kris collection compare to the other museum in Bali. The kris collection originate from various regions in Indonesia."

There are several buildings which display works depicting the island history, myths and developments in style as outside influences crept into the traditional work and also the reverse happening.I particularly liked the paintings depicting the everyday lives of Balinese-the wedding, funeral, harvesting ceremonies. The wayan shadow puppets, the Hindi religious symbols and several scenes from the Mahabharata. The spiritual and ritualistic life is easy to follow in these works as are the beautiful landscapes of Bali and of its people- calm, serene & good natured.The museum was founded by Suteja Neka and also has the personal collection of Neka who was an avid collector. Maybe his interests were nurtured by his father who was a sculptor and then by his friendships with many overseas artists who may have encouraged him to collect art and then museum.I noticed an Aust artist - Donald Friend's work hanging which was great as I believe he did spend some time in this ideallic island.There is a reception pavilion, a souvenir and book shop and a pavilion with open sides where one can have a rest.Also the photography pavilion was well worth looking into - The museum runs educational programs in art & culture of Bali.This is another museum that can be considered of international standardAlso has works of overseas artists "

The collection of Keris kept in the museum is well worth a visit for anyone even remotely interested in this traditional and revered mystical weapon. if you speak only English it is hard to make yourself understood with the staff, so finding information is quite hard. I suggest you buy the book on sale at the counter called \"Understanding Balinese Keris\", which goes into detail describing some of the finer pieces in the collection. Apparently, if you get lucky, you might get to meet Mr Neka himself, who is known to walk people through his collections. But I had no such luck unfortunately. Some of the descriptive signs on the displayed Keris are wrong and seem to have been swapped out. This doesn't take away from the beautiful kerisses, but it is a bit confusing."

So many of the paintings are much of a muchness, and you get the feeling that the artistic flair that gave rise to the modern Ubud has now given way to a mechanical form of art that largely lacks inspiration. Which is sad, but is perhaps inevitable, as the younger generation of Balinese look for their income in different ways.But the building is beautiful, with a lovely temple in the middle, and so this gallery is worth a stroll around if for no other reason than to admire the building itself."

A visit to Neka Art Museum gives you an insight into the fantastic creativity of Balinese artists and their influence on visiting artists also. Suteja Neka has created a peaceful environment of multiple pavilions laid out in the manner of a Balinese compound, all set in a restful garden setting. For a crash course on Balinese painting history or an in-depth exploration, Neka Museum is the first place that I would recommend for you to visit. Allow some time for your visit. The paintings are all carefully labelled with details of the artist and descriptions of the myths and legends that make up the image. The quality of the paintings is of the highest. Not mentioned much is the sculpture, but there are examples of wood carvings from the best Balinese sculptors. The Pavilions themselves also are entered through wonderful old Bali doors. The garden is scattered with mostly anonymous stone carvings, but amongst them are quite a few by I Wayan Cemul, the famous primitif sculptor, associate of Rudolf Bonnet."

It was almost empty of tourists \u2013 just 5-6 other people in the entire museum \u2013 which was a great relief. The collection is really excellent too, covering early Ubud and greater Bali painting from the early 1900\u2019s through to modern art, photos and more. Set in a series of 7-8 villas in a relaxing compound and with full English explanations for every display, this was a great visit.

I am not an art critic, so take my comments with a sack of salt! It's European and Balinese art fusion, if there's such a word for it. I went to both Neka and Musuem Puri Lukisan. I like Neka better because it's more contemporary. It's smaller though. Puri Lukisan was all dark and grey. So if you are into Balinese art and have 75k rupiah to spare, try one of these in Ubud to fill the time."

A visual delight, close to great eateries and other galleries and you are guaranteed to feel the generous spirit of the Neka family. Why not visit the Neka gallery downtown as well?"

This museum is just right across from Naughty Nuri's, a BBQ place famous among Chinese visitors (the BBQ spare ribs is delicious). Neka is named after Sutejo Neka, an artist whose father was a famous wood carver. This museum is huge and sprawled across a few buildings. The artwork tells of the history of Bali and its people including artists like Dutchman Arie Smit who is well-respected by the Balinese artist community as the man who encouraged the young artist movement in Bali. It takes a while to traverse and enjoy the art here so make sure you have at least 1-2 hours to spare."

This was our second visit to the Neka art gallery and not a lot seems to have changed in the 7 year gap between visits. The collection is spread throughout a series of airy pavilions in a lovely garden setting on the edge of the Campuhan River. The earlier Balinese paintings and the work of Arie Smit (who unfortunately died last week - just before his 100th birthday) were my favourite galleries - although I fell in love with a beautiful Balinese painting of the Animals disembarking from Noah's Ark. The place was very quiet and we spent about 2 hours looking around. It feels a little neglected and although it has a lovely terrace, the coffee shop is more of a snack bar than a place to linger and relax. We headed back down the hill and stopped at the Indus restaurant for lunch and a spectacular view. A lovely way to spend a morning."

When we asked the security guards why it was closed they said the guy had gone home.The security guards were not in uniform and were just sitting around smoking. They made us feel that the Neka staff are so totally lazy. The fact that the book shop could just close because the guy wanted to go home is so totally unacceptable. At 4pm in one gallery a security guard started to close the windows in preparation for going home, but this cut down the light and made it difficult to see the work.The museum sell tickets and therefore have an obligation to customers to deliver the service that they have paid for. Mr Neka has assembled a great collection and it is well worth a visit, but the total laziness of the staff does not do justice to the arts of Bali."

There is also a restaurant just opposite it which is supposed to be very good.The only thing I didn't like and found really disconcerting was how this guy, who seemed to work at the museum, as a gardener or something, had 3-4 cockerels in little baskets in the museum garden, right in the centre of the complex. He kept taking these cockerels out one by one and hitting them with both hands on their sides, making them angry, and getting each one to peck one of the other ones in a basket. Hearing these cockerels screeching was pretty horrible and went on for a while. We had just passed a cock fight that afternoon so it was pretty obvious that the guy was training them to fight. Cock fighting is technically illegal in Indonesia I think but it still goes on. I found it pretty disturbing and it did spoil my visit. I'm assuming that it was a one off event and doesn't happen often. I hope not anyway."

Of course it won't tell you everything you want to know about the Balinese, but you will be able to see a little bit of the Balinese Hinduism, some of their own history, the Balinese daily life and their idealistic life style and so much other stuffs. The art museum wast the first to make me appreciate the Balinese."

The museum is situated above Ubud and is only a few moments away by taxi and if you're hot on arrival I recommend sitting, for a short while in the naturally aired arrival area to cool off before going to see the collections of art works. The arrival area has a wonderful view of green trees and home-lets across the gorge. The museum itself is divided into about four main gallery buildings, in the traditional Balinese style and they are easily accessible and the directions from the reception area are clear to follow. The gardens around the paths and the buildings are a delight. The art collections are quite substantial and contain traditional Balinese art forms, an photographic collection of early days in Bali and very good Balinese/Indonesian contemporary collection of artworks also. There is also a book shop near the reception area and a store with an array of Balinese clothing and artifacts. On the down side there is only a small snack bar in the arrival area which sells snacks and cool drinks - tea and coffee. And the toilet facilities are small also and are situated on the main road side of the arrival car park."

The early traditional Balinese collection is a great starting point, through to the collections of the European artists who settled in Bali during the 1940's and influenced the style of painting. I was fascinated by the pavilion with early photos taken by an American couple giving an insight into a more traditional period. A famous Balinese artist, Lempad is showcased in another pavilion of his outstanding pen and Ink drawings. I spent many hours at Neka and came back a number of times during my stay as I found it fascinating,with a diverse collection that is unique even by world standards( if you are an art lover!) .

The Ubud Writers' Festival has Neka at its heart each October. We visited between sessions at the festival. There is a comprehensive collection of traditional Balinese art by a huge range of artists - based on spirituality, agriculture and nature. There are rooms of Europeans who fell in love with Bali such as Arie Smit, Rudolf Bonnet, Antonio Blanco, one Walter Spies painting and the Australian Donald Friend. There are the modern artists who humorously entwine tourist culture with traditional painting styles.There are different buildings with lots of seats and windows for cool breezes and views - and gardens between each. Neka has a very well stocked gift shop with prints, books, postcards, calendars and lots of the usual ikat, sarongs, jewellery and so on.There are similarities to ARMA at the other end of Ubud. Both are highly recommended."

Having said that, I did find a number of extremely painterly works. The gardens are pretty, it's a good place to escape central Ubud, note that the cafe closes early, and it's cool. I'd certainly recommend you visit as the written notes to paintings are informative about Balinese traditions and culture.Only people who want something for nothing would baulk at the 50,000Rp entry fee."

At Neka museum, featuring a comprehensive and nicely curated collection, I was able to appreciate all the beautiful Balinese art by both classical as well as contemporary Balinese artists such as Nyoman Gunasa. What makes Neka special is that you get to admire Balinese art in its original source - Ubud where the artists drew inspiration from over the ages and you get to see the evolution and progression of Balinese art from the traditional composition depicting village ceremony and life in intricate illustrations to the dynamic expressive style of contemporary Balinese artist, expressing the soul and beauty of Ubud, it's spirit , culture , history and heritage in vibrant brush strokes and vivid colors. Certainly a MUST VISIT for lovers of Indonesian and Balinese art."

You can wander through the different rooms taking in the old artworks with their unique style and on to modern paintings. It gives you the impression that the natural world, the spiritual world and our human condition are major forces in the minds of the artists. A lovely reflection of Balinese culture."

If you go to art museums when you visit cities in America or Europe, you absolutely should visit the Neka Art Museum. You will learn a lot about how Balinese see the world. The art there stems from Germans and other Europeans teaching Balinese Western art techniques in the '20s and '30s. Then they took the ball and ran with it. So visiting this museum is both an artistic and a cultural experience. It includes art by Westerners with Balinese subjects.When we went the museum was practically empty expect for us and Russian-American couple we're friends with. This is a serious art museum with worthy art in it, from abstract expressionist works to the most typical Balinese paintings--colorful, crowded depictions of the busy work and social life that's all intertwined for most Balinese. It's a short drive from Ubud, doesn't cost much to visit, and is on attractive grounds. Tourists would do themselves a favor by spending less time at cheesy, tropical-generic tourist attractions and more at uniquely Balinese ones like this. Whatever genre of art you like, from avant garde/ironic to more traditional expressions, it can be found here."

The highly polished crimson floor tiles and white walls establish an excellent canvas to display the art. The art is all quite recent, with the earliest coming from the mid 20th century. It covers traditional Balinese painting, highly complex and generally telling stories of every day life or of Hindu legends; modern Balinese painting by indigenous artists; and art by visitors who settled in Bali, mainly Dutch, Australian and Phillippino. The explanations for each picture are comprehensive, and the art is logically arranged by style or artist. 1.5 to 2 hours gives you a comprehensive look. It's a good walk from Ubud Palace if you are fit- otherwise a simple cab fare. After visiting, we were comfortable that the painting we had bought the day before had some grounding in genuine Balinese painting--probably smarter to go to the gallery first though!"

Photos in black and white depicting the island in the 40s were fantastic, then you could see what was Bali before the mass tourism. Many pictures made by the westerns and natives are awesome as well showing specific details that help us to understand better the traditions of their culture. A must in Ubud. It was empty when i went there by bicycle so i enjoyed more."

I was looking forward to visiting the famous Neka Art Museum in Ubud as word has it that they have a fantastic Kris collection (or Keris in Indonesian). The museum also houses art collections from the early classical Balinese paintings to the transitional styles and the Ubud and Butuan style paintings. There\u2019s a section for young artists and contemporary style paintings (which I couldn\u2019t appreciate!) and contemporary Indonesian art, including some black and white photographs. On display are also works by current Indonesian artists and some foreign artists, as long as these have been inspired by the culture, natural beauty and life of Bali in them.We were highly appreciative and humbled that Pak Suteja Neka, the originator, founder and current Director of these precious art and Kris collections offered to show us around and give us a tour of his awesome collection, which originated as a passionate hobby, now is recognized as an institute of international standing. We began with the the amazing kris collection. In 2005, UNESCO declared the Indonesian keris as a great cultural achievement of world humanity. The kris is much more that just a weapon. Each piece has some history and story to tell, has been decisive in winning battles, has given their owner power and strength, and it goes on. Considering the time they were forged, the craftsmanship is utterly amazing and mind boggling, not to mention the inlaid decorative precious jewels and stones, delicate carving, the balance between blade and handle, etc.The art collection comprising over 300 pieces, grouped and classified, is housed in several buildings and rooms, which in themselves have been patterned in Balinese architecture. Much information about early Balinese life and culture can be gleaned from these precious art works. They are so priceless with regards to research, education and information for anyone who\u2019s interested, and an inspiration for non-Balinese visitors. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t have the luxury of spending much time at this section, but had a overall account with details of certain interesting pieces pointed out to us. It was however, sufficient to have an appreciation of the cultural and life style changes that transited over the years in Bali through the eyes of various artists!You can spend an entire day if you\u2019re so inclined, to look closely at the collection, or you can browse them in the groups that they are shown without getting into small details, and still appreciate the changes or transition in the culture, life, and the natural beauty of early and contemporary Bali.Whatever you choose to do in Ubud, don\u2019t pass up the chance to visit this awesome museum. It\u2019s not to be missed. And it\u2019s definitely worth a return visit!Neka Art MuseumRaya Campuhan St.Kedewatan Village, Ubud Gianyar 80571The Museum is opened :Monday-Saturday: 9 A.M.- 5 P.M. \u2028Sunday: NOON - 5 P.M. \u2028Closed: National Holiday.ADMISSION FEE \u2028for the Permanent Collection.\u2028Rp. 50.000 Adults and Free for children 12 and under."

We enjoyed our visit. Even my young children seemed to have a good time. For those with young children, watch out for some dangerous and very low windows on the second floor of some of the buildings. The management should put in some safety grills on those.Aside from traditional Balinese paintings, we found many contemporary styled paintings and interesting sculptures. I particularly liked Arie Smit's works. I also found a room full of old photographs of Balinese life which were interesting.The interiors of the buildings are not very posh and lack airconditioning that most modern galleries have for preservation of the art work. I wonder how the Museum keeps the paintings in good condition. The grounds are nice with some ducks on the lawn and people playing Indonesian instruments in one pavillion.It's a pleasant place to spend an hour in the afternoon when it's too hot to do much else."

Despite all these misgivings, I still went. Boy, am I glad I did! I was stunned by the masterpieces by artists like Affandi, Arie Smit, Walter Spies, Dullah, J. Elizalde Navarro, I.

This large museum, while not as beautifully situated or centrally located as the Museum Puri Lukisan, nonetheless has an unparalleled, extensive collection of painting, sculpture and carving the reflects the evolution of Balinese art. The museum's founder was the son of a carver famous in the 60\"s; the depth of the collection reflects their friendships with the major luminaries on the Balinese art scene.There paintings are grouped by styles, with explanations of the evolution and differentiating features of each described. Not all the paintings are attributed, but until western influence, Balinese artists didn't usually sign their work, so some of the minimalist signage is to be forgiven. Sculptures are scattered throughout. There is a nice range and depth to the works, even the more contemporary pieces. Exclusive to this museum is a huge collection of Kris, or Balinese daggers, many prize winning from contemporary competitions. Mokume-gane blades, golden, ivory and wooden handles and sheaths, gemstone encrusted Ganesha's- even if you do not like weaponry (me!), the beauty of some of these pieces is not to be denied.

            "review": "Surprisingly good.. It's a short list, but the Neka Art Museum is probably *the* museum to visit in Ubud. (Avoid the Rudana - like the plague.) First, the pros: the curation. Here, the history of Balinese painting - from the traditional wayang/Kamasan style, to the works of the so-called transitional era, to the prolific Ubud and Batuan schools of more recent years - is laid out chronologically in separate galleries, with explanatory labels in English, for both broad thematics and individual pieces. The walkthrough ends with several rooms of contemporary Balinese art, which runs the gamut from gestural canvases to abstract sculpture to the local Young Artists movement of the 1960s and '70s. There are also galleries dedicated to specific artists, the most prominent of which is probably Arie Smit, whose work fills an entire floor. (Anyplace else and Smit's brand of recycled Primitivism-meets-Impressionism-meets-Cloisonisme would look embarrassingly vapid - he was painting this stuff even into the '80s and beyond - but here he's a force to be reckoned with. God help the Balinese.) The Lempad gallery, on the other hand, while far more modest in scope, is a revelation. The small drawings which the master has become known for are both aesthetically unique (insofar as Balinese art history is concerned) and fascinating social documents, providing quirky, humour-laced insights into the everyday life of the island in the first half of the 20th century. In short, while the collection may seem a little uneven, the curation - of a surprisingly high standard for an institution of its kind, i.e. a provincial Indonesian museum - deserves a shoutout. Now, the cons: It's a bit of a trek from downtown Ubud. Unless you have transportation, hoofing it over may not be a good idea ... The lack of air-conditioning is also something of a distraction (although, to be here, most other museums hereabouts suffer similar issues). Otherwise, two thumbs up."

Some of the works are wonderful, some less pleasing perhaps, but there is great importance in having a collection like this which reflects themes and developments and trends in the history of art in Bali.

The Arie Smit collection was lovely too. Interesting sculpture as well, both traditional and modern. The setting itself was peaceful, set out among a quiet compound of gardens and pavillions.

I enjoyed the whole place, but the special display upstairs of the traditional weapons, the kris/keris, was just mind blowing. Anyone who has an interest in knives, swords, damascene steel and the like would be riveted.It is astounding how many different named patterns of damascening can be found on just one blade- my favourite had five separate patterns on a blade that can't have been more than 30cm long.The displays were fascinating, the surroundings were quite beautiful and tranquil. Not a place for little kids, or people with mobility problems, as there are a lot of changes in level. Certainly not what a lot of people would regard as entertaining, but if you are interested in the history and aesthetics of Bali, I would say it is a must, along with the Puri Lukisan museum and the puppet museum, both of which are also in Ubud."

The Neka Art Museum is one of Bali\u2019s most important venues for Indonesian art and art by international artists focussing on Bali. This place has several pavilions of paintings and some sculpture, most depicting village life and the everyday rituals and mythology of Bali. Traditional Balinese painting, like Buddhist and Hindu art I\u2019m familiar with, is highly detailed, colourful, and representational, sometimes in a deliberately na\u00efve style. Some of the contemporary Indonesian painting on view looked much like western painting from the 50s, some was reminiscent of German expressionism, and some more like Gauguin. [We were staying in the rice fields and, walking down the street towards the Neka, were also able to visit several contemporary art galleries and studios, the most interesting of which was the Sika Gallery of Contemporary Art.] Entrance to the Museum is 50,000 rupiah (about $5.50).After immersing ourselves in art, we felt a powerful hunger coming on and staggered out of the Neka and into Naughty Nuri\u2019s barbeque house just across the street, where we munched on BBQ\u2019d chicken and pork, along with several other art lovers.

Anyone with even a passing interest in Balinese art will find much to engage them in the extensive collection of traditional and contemporary art. Set in beautiful grounds, the Museum is organised in pavilions. I was particularly taken with the Batuan style, with intricate and humorous paintings that warrant many viewings. They have so much detail and wit that they are reminiscent of the best graphic novel art of the West. Give yourself plenty of time. The art of many of the Western artists who made their home in Bali is also on display. The Rp 50000 admission is well worth it."

This is devoted to displaying a comprehensive selection of paintings in a permanent exhibition - it is not a gallery devoted to sales. so one can enjoy the art without hassle.

After reading about the various museums of art in Bali, this was the one that stood out to me as being the most interesting, and I wasn't disappointed. The Neka Art Museum isn't large (and doesn't appear to be at all handicapped accessible, just as a heads-up) but it is well laid out and very pleasant. While it was a little bizarre to wander around a museum whose \"climate control\" was open windows and verandas, it did make for a pleasant experience. The art was laid out roughly chronologically, with the first halls introducing the older styles of art, then showing how the art started to change and how that change was localized to different parts of the island. The last rooms showed an array of modern Balinese art, and also art done by foreigners who had come to Bali.If you have any interest in art and want a flavor of what the local art scene has been like for the last 150 years or so, this museum is well worth the visit."

I visited the Museum Puri Lukisan and the Agung Rai Museum of Art (ARMA) which were both very worthwhile, but Neka Art Museum was the last thing I did in Ubud and I loved this one the most. It is open daily from 9am to 5pm and the cost is Rs50,000. It is located just a couple of kms out of town on Jalan Raya Sanggingan. If you are walking, just follow the main street towards Campuan, cross the bridge, walk up the hill and keep going until Neka appears on your right.Give yourself plenty of time as this is a wonderful and extensive collection. There is traditional Balinese work, Balinese and other Indonesian contemporary art, entire pavilions devoted to Arie Smit and I Gusti Nyoman Lempad, extensive displays of artists from abroad who painted in Bali and much more. I really enjoyed Abdul Aziz, Johan Rudolf Bonnet, Willem Gerard Hofker and Donald Friend and many, many others.The pictures are well labeled and well exhibited. This is an excellent collection."
