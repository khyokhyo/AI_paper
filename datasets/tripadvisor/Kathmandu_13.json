Budhanilkantha Temple, located in Budhanilkantha, Nepal, (Nepali: \u092c\u0941\u0922\u093e\u0928\u0940\u0932\u0915\u0902\u0920 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0930) (literal: \"Old Blue Throat\") is a Hindu open air temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. Budhanilkantha Temple is located at the base of the Shivapuri Hill and can be identified by a large reclining statue of Lord Vishnu. The temple's main statue of Budhanilkantha is considered the largest stone carving in Nepal.According to one story, a farmer and his wife once struck a figure while plowing the field, which caused it to start soaking blood into the ground. This turned out to be the figure of lost deity of Budhanilkantha, which was recovered and placed in its present position.A legend states that King Pratap Malla (1641\u20131674) had a prophetic vision. This vision resulted in him believing that kings of Nepal would die if they visited the Budhanilkantha Temple. Nepali monarchs after King Pratap Malla have never visited the Temple in fear of the prophecy.Budhanilkantha is one attraction of Kathmandu valley as it carries different history of Nepal"

This 7th Century Carving lays in a pool of green slimy dirty water, surrounded by a yellow concrete fence, and a dirty tarp overhead. The rest of the Temple site is totally unmaintained and falling apart. There aren't really any , or many photo ops here, and locals will scold you if you hold your camera over the fence to take a picture, but everyone including the Hindu's do it. Otherwise this is about a two minute viewing,, kind of like a display at the zoo, and that's about it. There are a few vendors selling the usual stuff nearby but there's really nothing new here."

It is quite small and not a temple complex as I was expecting. The microbus is fun out here, unless you're a foreigner of foreign height and therefore can't actually stand up in minibus when it's overflowing with people.Actually I got kicked out, asked to leave, despite being told by a Hindu family outside that everyone is welcome in a Hindu temple, I don't think anyone told the guy inside! And no, i didn't do anything offensive or get my camera out, just asked to leave as none hindu.Could have so easily given this a miss taking into account all the effort, still it was the starting point of the days schedule taking in here, Kopan, boudhanath and the Crematoria, which were all so much more interesting.I'd say you could give it miss if it doesn't fit in your schedule."

A short walk up takes you to the reclining Buddha in a pond, off limits to non-Hindus but perfectly visible for the outside. If you are feeling a bit more energetic, Shivapuri national park is a walk up the hill where you can visit some Buddhist temples and enjoy the beautiful forest paths that meander around this lovely area."

At this temple on the outskirts of Kathmandu (a little more than a half-hour drive northeast from the Thamel tourist area) is a big sculpture of Vishnu lying on snakes in water in a shelter (with a fence around and a big cloth cover on top) at the inner area of the temple grounds on which are also a few smaller shrines and a few two-story buildings.There was quite a bit of crowd at the outer area of the grounds at the time of my visit maybe due to some ceremony going on because I saw this big \"kind of\" human-shaped round thing (with like a head & a body but with no arms & legs) wrapped in black and also a wedding display of sorts nearby featuring a young couple sitting on a small platform in like a tent with a painting of Mount Everest behind them and flower pots in front of them along the edge of the tent.Despite a far distance from the heart of the city (the area of Thamel & Durbar Square), I would say this place is worthwhile for its \"creative\" display of Lord Vishnu; and I don't know if there's a similar statue of Vishnu elsewhere, but there's a Buddha wrapped around by a snake and sitting on water that you can see at Bodhgaya in India! :)I did a combo tour with a car & a driver arranged at my hotel in Thamel, costing 3,000 Nepalese rupees (about US$30), with the first stop being Bodhnath Stupa (about half an hour to the east) followed by this temple (another half an hour to the north from Bodhnath) and then Swayambhunath Stupa on a hilltop (about 45 minutes from this temple) before finally returning back to Thamel; and that's probably the best way to go about to see these sights given the significant distances to this temple and Bodhnath from Thamel (especially to this temple being so far that even the mountains surrounding the Kathmandu Valley on that side are seen quite \"closer\" when you're here compared to seeing them from the city!). Actually, you could also consider doing just Bodhnath and this temple with a car tour and doing Swayambhunath on your own since that one's in a walking distance from Thamel (about a half-hour walk west), saving like a thousand rupees."

But the big attraction at this particular temple for followers is the sleeping Vishnu as creator, appearing to float in a pool of water that is representative of the cosmic sea.On the morning of our visit, the devotees were more than a tad distracted by a film crew in action, and the gorgeous green and gold sari-clad film star, posing with appropriate hair tosses for the camera \u2013 much more glamorous than the middle-aged Aussie woman with her wash-and-wear travel pants and shirt and sturdy Merrell shoes.While the 7th century Vishnu carved from one gigantic piece of black stone (uncovered by a farmer and hauled to its current location) was impressive, the real delight for us came from the children running around with their friends, pausing on occasion to cheekily pose for John\u2019s camera, maybe practising for when they \u2018make it\u2019 on the big screen."

Buddhanilkantha is a an impressive carved stone statue of the sleeping Vishnu in a tank of water surrounded by a few small temples and shrines.I visited in June 2015, shortly after the earthquake so travellers were thin on the ground in Kathmandu and there were no others at Buddhanilkantha. It's not such a popular attraction for travellers so it makes a change from the other busier places.The statue is best seen from within the gates where you maybe able to walk all the way around it - sometimes though you can only see Vishnu from the 'feet end'. However, strictly speaking, access is limited to Hindus (the temple boys will remind you of this) so you may only be able to see it from outside the railings.Regardless, it's worth the short trip to such an ancient and peaceful statue that is very important to Hindus. There is no fee but donations are welcome.It's in the north of the valley and easy to get to from Thamel by taxi or bus for the more adventurous. It's right on the edge of the valley and it's only a few minutes walk to open country, an hour or so to Nagi Gompa (a large Buddhist nunnery) or a full day to Shivapuri Peak and back - the second highest peak on the valley rim."

The statue laying on the pond is of Vishnu, believed by Hindus to be the regulator of the universe. The temple even though small the statue is very big. You will not be allowed to touch the statue but yes you can photograph which is unique in Nepal because most places it's the opposite (i.e., you can touch but can't photograph). Nearby is a conservation area with a monastery on the top of the hill you can try climbing I took a bike along and it was heck of a ride :)."

My advise is to go out from crazy downtown, take a walk around and follow the road down and take the walk in amazing surroundings, plenty of small shops, street life, real Kathmandu. Once you are tired, you can stop Tempu (Tuk-Tuk) it is only munger 5 from there to go back downtown or some of the micros, but micro drivers ar kind of crazy :)"

The figure has been estimated to have been found buried in the ground in its original state more than thousand years ago. It is also known as Bhuijasi. Hindus throng to this sacred pilgrimage almost everyday to perform puja but a great number of worshippers can be seen in various festivals, especially on Haribodhini Ekadashi that falls between October/November, the day believed that the sleeping Lord Bishnu wakes up."

Non- Hindus can't go inside but you can view it from the sides- the statue draped with marigolds. Lots of other little shrines around and the Sadhu lady may sit with you in meditation if you are lucky. Definitely a power place of Kathmandu and worth visiting- easy to get to by bus. Very tasty roti and snacks from the stalls nearby."

You may leave it on any of the Gods or Goddesses, just remember to walk around the middle of the Temple in a clockwise direction. If you ask the Priest (pundit), he can lay the flowers at the feet of Vishnu for you. Non-Hindus can't go into the main small pond area, but you can see it thru the brick lattice work wall. Lovely visit!"

At the base of the Sivapuri hills is a remarkable statue of Lord Vishnu, reclining on a bed of coiled snakes. The statue said to be sculpted from a single block stone, is set in the middle of a small pond and appears to be floating in the water. The stone image is said to be one of three statues sculpted during the Lichhavi period and called Budhanilkantha named after the huge image of Lord Vishnu. The five meter long statue called Bhuijassi by the local Newaris of the Liccchivi \u2013 age settlement at the base of Shivapuri hills is also known as Budhanilkanta. The village, now also known as Budhanilkantha.During auspicious days like the eleventh day of the lunar month the priests bathe, clean, perfume, fan the deity and decorate it with ornaments. They also keep a piece of cloth on his forehead to save the deity from the stark sunlight that comes over his face."

Budhanilkantha literally means \u201cold blue-throat.\u201d Ananta has 11-hooded heads. It is believed that the deity was carved in the 7th or 8th century during the Licchavi period. Hindus can walk down the steps and touch His feet.The main festival of the year is when Lord Vishnu, who sleeps on the cosmic ocean during Caturmasya period wakes up on the Haribondhini Ekadashi day in late October or early November.Many thousands of people come on this day. Three other images of Lord Vishnu were carved at the same time. One is here at Budhanilkantha and is considered the most important and original, one is at Balaju Gardens, and one is at the old Royal Palace in Kathmandu, but can not be viewed by tourist. The king of Nepal is not allowed to see the deity at Budhanilkantha, but he can see the other two deities.The deity of Budhanilkantha was lost for a while and was later rediscovered by a farmer. It is believed that the farmers struck the buried deity with his plough and that blood came out from the ground.The morning puja between 9 and 10 am is interesting."

While it is a lovely statue, remember that if you are not Hindu, you cannot get this close as in the photo, and it is a small temple area so it is a long way to go for just seeing this. And the story that it 'came out of the ground in a single piece' is a bit of a stretch but is the main point of the temple."

Situated north of kathmandu, Budhaneelkantha showing Lord Vishnu sleeping on a coiled snake in the middle of the ocean, is one of the finest examples of Nepali art. Built by king Vishnugupta in the seventh century A.D., this is a sacred shrine of the Vashnavites in the valley. The pond, in whose centre the statue is located,symbolizes the ocean.There is an interesting aside. King of Nepal cannot visit Budhaneelkantha as he is considered an incarnation of Vishnu. As such being equal to him or part of him he can not visit him."

Boudhanilkanta is very congested and polluted and apart from one big hotel offered us little, so we returned to Thamel through more dense traffic, choking and slightly disappointed."
