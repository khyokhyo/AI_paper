We were unlucky that by around 3pm there were high wind warnings meaning all rides were effectively closed but we managed to get some in before 3pm so I guess that was ok."

While we have usually enjoyed Ocean Park, our last visit was very disappointing. We arrived 30 minutes before opening and entered when the gates opened. We have done this previously, enjoying the Park before it gets too crowded. This time we were disappointed to find that the rides and food & beverage sales did not open until 11:00 AM or later. We were informed over and over that they were \"Getting ready.\" It was one and a half hours before we got on a ride. We spent one and a half hours walking around in the hot sun looking for water because they took our water away at the entrance. There's another amusement park in Hong Kong. It's a bit more expensive than Ocean Park, but when they open their gates, they are ready to entertain you."

Total entry fees for three of us: HK$1,155.The weather was pretty bad but there were NO signs up at the ticket booths to suggest that any rides would be out of action. I also asked the woman at the ticket booth if there were any problems with rides and she said she didn't think so.As soon as we entered the Park we saw a digital sign saying some rides might be closed. NOTE this was AFTER WE HAD PAID OUR ENTRY FEES.We took the cable car to the far end of Ocean Park to discover that nearly ALL the rides were shut. NOT a single sign up to explain for how long.Even the Raging river attraction (half way down the mountain on the other side) was \"closed for inspection\" but the people \"on duty\" there couldn't even tell us for how long and seemed confused that we would even want to know the answer.Given the amount of money involved in visiting this park it was a TOTAL RIP OFF.Management should be ashamed at luring people in and then only alerting them to problems with the rides AFTER they have paid.If they have any decency they will offer a refund. But I'm not holding my breath...."

I have never seen so many people in my life! Tons to see and do, plenty of food choices, lots of rides and of course the displays are excellent. It is not a cheap day out but it is an alternative to Disneyland and a bit more \"educational' if thats your thing. But loads of fun if thats all you are after. Go with a group and enjoy the day."

            "review": "So much better than Disneyland. This was my wife's first trip to a decent theme park. We went to Disney land last year and while she enjoyed it, Ocean Park just has SOOOO much more to see and do ! So lets start at the beginning, Don't buy your ticket at the concierge in the hotel and certainly NOT at the park its self, we found it cheaper at Admiralty MTR. Leave early, and try arrive as the park opens, at 1000hrs i think. Our experience, in September, was that the rides at opening time are empty ! We rode all the biggest and best rides, without queuing. Ironically, the Ferris wheel had a ten minute queue while we walked straight onto all the roller coasters. However we watched the show, ending at 1600hrs, and the throng of people arriving was amazing, hundreds upon hundreds of people, it certainly pays to arrive early ! The mixture of, Panda's, sea life, aquariums, seals, penguins, shows and rides make for a truly memorable day, and represents fantastic value for money. So in summary, 1. Buy your ticket at Admiralty MTR, ride the bus from there.2. Arrive as soon as the gate opens.3. Ride all the biggest and best rides early, even if it means walking ALOT4. SEE THE PANDAS !!!!!5. Allow all day, we arrived at 1000hrs, and left at 1730hrs, queued only once for 10 minutes and still felt we hadn't done it all !6. Enjoy !Oh the only disappointment was the price of food and drink (a normal gripe in these type of places), and the cable car was closed for maintenance on the day we visited."

            "review": "Halloween. I went to Hong Kong just for the ocean park Halloween. This year their daytime ticket gives access to their night time Halloween too! So I got there early and went visit the panda exhiibit. The red panda was really cute and cuddly and not really camera shy. The whole park was swarming with tourists and many were from China. The Halloween was also well done this year. With their staffs donning makeup and dressing up as Chinese vampire, ghost buster stay puff marshmallow man, witches, ghost dolls, zombie and hell entities. The Hwa Wei palace of death was really scary. As the ghost will jump out from nowhere to scare you and the ghost house was really dark can improve on the lighting. We also visit the school of shadows and it was also really real and scary. I like the ghost buster academy where you can learn how ghost busters learn their tricks and even a laser shooting game to shoot ghost and be ranked on their chart.i suggest that to cut short some waiting queuing time to start queuing at popular ghost house like ghost buster and school of shadow 15 mins before it opens. Average queuing time is about 15-45mins. You can take bus at bus terminal right outside Admiralty station which brings you straight to ocean park."

They obviously had over sold entrance without considering how their guests can possibly enjoy the park. Park has a nice theme and plenty to do, but everything is at least 90 minutes wait. Park was too full, cable car in the picture was two hours wait on each way. We did 3 rides during the ten hours in the park, spent the rest of the 6 hours waiting in lines. I am sure you can figure this one out."

The lines is the only flaw of the park, for the rest it has attractions for every taste and colour: colourful perfomances made by fancy dressed actors, breathtaking views from the cable car, Old Hong Kong installation, a wide variety of animals and ocean inhabitants... The highlight of my trip absolutely was seeing a panda - an extremely adorable creature. Most of the park decorations and attractions are always changing according to the season (my trip was near Helloween, the actors managed to create a really fancy atmosphere). Ocean park would definately impress you + add more fun photos to your travel album! Admission ticket is about 350 HK dollars, totally worth its money. Must see!"

We took the 171 bus there from Mongkok as it didn't require any transfers and sitting on top of a double decker bus provided a great view of the city from Mongkok all the way down to HK island. Once we were there, we walked a little to get to the park entrance. After going in you can start planning your day but we started by going to the submit and working our way back. This was to keep our energy level up so we get to experience the entire park. Overall the park offer some adult rides but don't expect them to be exceptionally thrilling. This park is known for it various aquatic tours and attractions but there are activities for everyone. They have various animal exhibitions which we recommend to quickly check out but the dolphin/seal show was a buzz kill so set your expectation low if you decide to go. Otherwise enjoy the park and as it was a fun day for us!"

The rides on The Summit are amazing and adrenaline pumping. They're definitely not for the fainthearted. The dolphin show was really good and it was amazing to see how nicely they are trained. The aquarium is slightly under kept and could be maintained better but overall good enough for a one time visit. Would be better to finish The Summit first and then do the areas in The Waterfront. A better way to cover the entire park as most adult rides are on The Summit.However, the downside is that there's too much walking involved up and down the hill. The map doesn't really help you get around the place and the entire park is spread over a very wide area. Getting from one place to another is really tiresome. Food is not so great for vegetarians. There's hardly anything available. But all in all, good place for family outing."

The aquarium is very impressive and of course the pandas are so cute. We started our day on the lower part of the park and then caught the cable car up to the higher part of the park which contains the majority of the rides. The views on the cable car are an added bonus and you get a great view of a part of Hong Kong you don't get to see so often. The food in the park is also very good - especially in the old Hong Kong section and the noodles were amazing."

Our first impression was that the place was well spread out but we were disappointed to see the huge no of people turnout. We had deliberately chosen to go on a weekday, yet we were stuck due to the large crowd. Waiting for 1.5 hours in line for a single ride is too much to handle & the whole experience got spoiled because of the queues. The best part was the dolphin show, which was well played out & the 'Shark Mystique' enclosure which had different levels & different types of sharks. Thiese two were probably the best attractions of the park.A special mention for KLOOK here, even though their ticket said 'Fast Track' it wasn't. Also, we had taken a meal to go with the ticket & sadly none of the restaurants were open which was really tragic. We ended up spending time & money to get food which was really upsetting. Overall, not at all happy with the experience for a place which promised so much"

We bought our tickets online with the price practically similar with tickets bought at their booths. For first timers, we didn't find it difficult to commute to the park coming from Jordan Station. In fact, it was effortless. We spent an entire day at Ocean Park to fully enjoy all its attractions and rides. We arrived around 9 and left the place right after their light/fountain/fire show at around 6 or 7. I didn't research about the place, as I was dependent with my brother who organized this trip. As a result, I got confused on how to go around the place even with a map which was available everywhere in the park. It was very overwhelming because we didn't know where to start and we were all eager to see all their scheduled animal shows. I didn't even know where the cable car would take us and I only thought that it would just go up and then go down back to where it would fetch us. We made the cable car terminal our first stop but at this early, the queue was already long and we didn't want to wait for 1 hour to get our turn for our very first activity of the day. Meanwhile, the attendant kept telling everybody that there was a train that we could take instead. I didn't know where it was supposed to go as well but we just obliged. As we got off the train, the map started to make sense. We were on top of the mountain and this was also what was behind the mountain that we kept looking up while we were on the ground. That's where all the thrilling rides had been hiding. We started the first half of the day at the top of the mountain enjoying their roller coaster and other exciting rides. Note that there will always be a queue and each of them usually takes 45 minutes waiting time on the average. You really need to pack a lot of patience before coming to this place. We continued the rest of the day with more rides, visits to big aquariums, and animal shows of sea lions and dolphins. The day at the park was almost over and we still had not done what we had been really clamoring for that day, the cable car. We patiently waited for the last time and so we had the ride of our lives. It was already dark and it was peaceful and quiet. So we started singing our hearts out until we arrived at the bottom of the mountain.It was probably my best day in our 4 day vacation in Hong Kong. The weather was perfect. The sun didn't show up fully but it was just perfect as we didn't like it to be a hot day. Apart from the fun rides and shows that the park offered, there was actually one thing that topped the experience. It was the wonderful view from the top of the mountain that closed the deal for me. I would dare to say that this was the happiest place in Hong Kong for me."

We paid over a 1000 Hong Kong dollars for entrance tickets and then spent most of the day queuing to go on rides. The wait for some rides was over an hour. I can't understand why people spend over an hour in a queue on a hot day in order to go on a ride that lasts around a very few minutes. We were there for six hours and managed to get on three rides! These turned out to be very expensive rides considering the entrance price. We gave up in the end. Not good value for money."

Going during the summer in the weekend or public holiday is chaotic and humid. Extremely humid! If you go during a Monday around the months of March, April, or September you will have a much better visit. Prices for ticketing are fair and the variety of restaurants are few, but the food is excellent. This is definitely a place for animal lovers and families to experience Hong Kong's variety of wild life.For those who concern parking or transportation you can go by taxi bus or private car. A mtr is in the process of being build right outside the entrance."

Best to head directly for the cable car to bring you all the way up to enjoy the more powerful rides. Then slowly make your way down. Best to take the train back to the entrance less crowded than taking the cable car again. Only downside, food options are rather expensive and not good at all. Yet again you dont come for the food at an amusement park. Big highlight, the dolphin show which aims to educate against marine pollution and the penguins!"

The park is big enough, keeping in mind the lack of space in Hong Kong, and a nice mix of roller coasters, museum / aquariums, cinema and animals. Better than the tiny Disneyland in my opinion.. I suggest visiting during work days as it is a popular place but a lot of the food / souvenir stands are closed (we came on Tuesday). Good for families, couples or groups of friends."

Nothing Ocean Park could do, I was just unlucky that they could not accept No for an answer (when I was alone). I understand why they do it as westerners are people they have little chance to see and want to show off to friends they have seen a westerner, and others were ok with no, but it is a little warning for the afternoons to ensure you do not get seperated from your group."

An MRT station is being built. Hours: 10-6. Cost: $HK380 approx. Ocean Park surprised me. Whilst it has rides in a variety of 'lands', it was the animal and earth exhibits that really fascinated me. From giant pandas and red pandas up close to the far from shy penguins vying for your attention, to the beautiful aquarium and rain forest land, there was more to see than the day permitted. The rides are fun and some quite terrifying. The over the cliff roller coaster and the abyss rides are heart stopping and you will get wet on the wild rapids. The restaurants are in reasonable supply - check out the 'Tuxedo' and be entertained by penguins diving and swimming whilst you have lunch (a huge glass wall separates the dining area from the penguin pool). Accessibility: be prepared to move across a large area. Plenty of ramps and disabled access. The Ocean Express is a great train (submarine?) ride that takes you to the summit..Facilities: Plenty of clean toilets thought the park. A number of kiosks and gift shops. Souvenirs: Plenty - especially about penguins, pandas and, walruses. Tips: Go on the Ocean Park Tower and enjoy spectacular views of the area. Avoid the aquarium when filled with children (it's a huge echo chamber), plan your day as you won't fit it all in over 8 hours."

The rides avg 1.5min per ride and they are fun the roller coasters are nice they have 4 and each differ in speed level.The shows are amazing and you have to be in the location 30min before so you find a good place to sit.The most attractive are the animals from the Panda, dolphins, sea lions, penguin and the Koala. Sadly it closes at 6pm and we were not able to see the birds.You won't wait long nor need a fast track if you go on week days and early."

Ocean park was the last place we visited before wrapping up the trip, and yes it was worth it. they have a cable car that connects the land front to the water front based park. its a full day activity with a lot to walk, if you want to take the cable car, go to water front area first, this way the lines/queues are shorter. the water front area has a lot of rides, the best one is the roller coaster overlooking the sea. they also do have dolphin shows and a shark aquarium hosted there. the food options re not much and its pricey as well, they do not let you carry any water or food inside. now to go back to the land front park you can board the express train that is designed to look like a submarine. loved the golden fish arena and panda territory here, they had a huge aquarium, which was not the best that i saw. but ocean park is a suggested activity, can be equally enjoyed by children and adults."

Would not recommend for senior citizens though as it involves lot of walking around.Impressive designs of the shops, rides are very inviting and the themed areas are also likeable. The rides are quite basic though but entertain nevertheless. Revolving Macao tower gives panoramic view of the park and topography around from a great height. Enjoyed this Tower ride multiple times (*also given the fact that it was relief to get in air conditioned cabin while it was extremely hot & humid outside ;-))Would recommend to start from the top level as there are more rides and places around there plus the view from top are just beautiful. Cable ride going to top level is a must do thing here. Eating places and choices are limited but quite easily found & available.We went on a clear day however it was hot & humid, advise you to carry enough water and hydrate regularly. Carrying a hat or cap is advised too.On the overall scale, its an enjoyable day out specially for families. Reach there at park opening times to enjoy maximum times once inside & avoid weekends totally. You will waste a lot of time on weekends waiting for rides in long queues. Try to Pre-book tickets and check out for some deals on few portals."

Ocean Park is a great park, it's combined amused park with Zoo, with the worst staff and food area you can imagine.I suggest to visit it on a raining day (summer) .The park have introduce recently the fast pass (cost money) but you can only ride 7 different attraction (you can not use for all the same). It worth if there is a lot of people or you don't like queu, as is not too expensive .Also they introduce a great feature that is the app of the park (all park have wifi free) that allow you to reserve 3 attraction of your choice,at a schedule time. you can make only one change... but they give you the schedule so is a bit confuse. Also you can check the waiting time for the attraction.The best views from the island of Hong honk and sourronding areas.BAD THINGS: don't try to buy food or EVEN water 1.5 hour before the park close ... Even they will replay on a very bad mood.Is not one of the employee if not most of the staff . They were so rude and unkind , never smile...If you need a Taxi to Kowloon forget about it... (Or queue for more than 1 hour) Take one to Hong Kong and then cross the bay, is quick the transfer than the queu and the same price..."

We walked straight in although lines were minimal at this time on a Monday so it would have been fine. We took others advice and headed straight to the summit side of the park by the train (The cable car was under maintenance unfortunately) and down to the far side. No lines on any of the rides! We rode everything twice without having to re-queue- maybe we were just lucky. By the afternoon this area was much busier. The rides are a mix of carnival style and a few larger roller coasters that are worth a go- the hair raiser by far was the highlight. The animal side of the park was great with a good diversity. I was impressed with the level of care- enclosures were to western standards, keepers were attentive and there was strong conservation messages throughout all shows and graphics. Much of the indoor animal areas were air conditioned too - a life saver on a hot and humid day and great to cool down in between rides.By about 1pm the bus loads of mainland Chinese have all arrived making the park much more crowded for the rest of the day. We spent about 6 hours there and didn't see everything- lots to do for all ages and well worth a visit."

My 8 year old son was not allowed which caused some big sadness. It is more than most other parks require for this kind of attraction and frankly I do not how the Chinese kids cope with this. Similar for Dragon (130 cm). Mine Train is more OK at 120 cm- Ridiculous lines for food around noon time. There is a small McDonalds but no chance we would waste time in the queue."

I'm writing this review because before I visited (Nov 2015) with my partner, (we are both in our 20s), it was very unclear that this park is entirely pitched at the 'family' entertainment level. By which I mean all of the rides are extremely tame and would only excite the under 12s. There is absolutely nothing thrilling on the same scale as say Alton Towers in the UK or any of the Orlando theme parks. The animal aspect of the park is also second rate and the enclosures for the larger mammals are particularly sad. None of the food stalls are particularly appetising, and there were reasonably long queues for everything (particularly the chair lift/gondola at the end of the day, around 2 hours!!), despite the fact we visited midweek.Positive aspects: nice views over the bay, if you have young children or have never been to a theme park or aquarium before you may find it reasonably interesting.Bottom line: if you are an adult without children and have limited time in Hong Kong then don't bother coming here."

The waterfront only has kiddy rides, aquarium, polar bear and koala. You can come see these in the evening, before closure. Food is expensive, go for McDonald's if on a budget.

We have annual passes so we get fast tracked (I think its about 5 rides per day) but what a good thing to have when the lines are backed right up. Our fav place to eat there and seems least expensive is near the bottom of the park by Mine carts? The wooden roller coaster overlooking the ocean."

Start early in the morning and reach here using the bus( a metro station is also coming up). We came prepared for rains and had already bought plastic overalls from a 7-11 before starting journey. Tickets should be bought online from klook for great discounts. There was already a line before the park opened. And do not forget to take a map. Once inside, do not wait to see any attraction on the entrance, quickly move towards the ropeway and reach the upper section of the park(you will see some beautiful views from the ropeway). Cover the Adventureland first and move backwards. This way you will be going against the crowd and beating the lineup happening. Please go to all the aquarium and animal enclosure. There is such amazing and important information shared there. You will understand the impact of human activities on the marine environment. Try to catch the dolphins show in ocean theatre. Cover the fun rides as you finish each area( we went for all roller coaster and scary ones since we didn't have any kids with us). Have lunch at thrill mountain and then take the train down. From now, your legs should start aching, but now it's the most peaceful part of the park. It's mainly panda and the aquarium now( like the one in finding Dory). You would find hoards of mainland China groups who may irritate you, but tell yourself this is the last part of the journey and enjoy while you are here. We spent around 6 hours here and were dead tired by the time we reached to hotel. Do not miss this place for anything !"

As I didn't have much time in HK, I was hesitating between Disney and Ocean Park and I am so glad I chose Ocean Park because it has more thrilling rides and aquariums. Cable car rides is a must to get to the majority of the attractions because most of it is located behind tall mountains but you are blessed with spectacular views of the sea and HK city.Unfortunately, we travelled during June which is the hottest season and the temperature was humid and very warm (about 36 degrees). We got dizzy and almost suffered from a heat stroke and always had to look for air-conditioned places to cool off. My advise is to always have a water bottle with you and hydrate yourself (there are water coolers around to refill). Food is slightly pricer (there is McDonald's there but the price is higher than normal) hence you can consider packing your own lunch.Overall, I would say its a good place to visit if you love thrills. Wear good shoes (lots of walking there) and hydrate yourself :)"

As well as having a huge theme park there is also an aquarium and other animals on display such as giant pandas, red pandas, arctic foxes, penguins, dolphins, sharks and many more. The park is mainly marine themed but also has other areas such as the arctic zone and Asian animals. The park is divided by a huge hill and you can get to the summit by taking the cable cars or the train- I would highly recommend taking the cable cars on the way up to the summit as you get some beautiful views going up. There are lots of rides for people of all thrill seeking levels- some of our favourites were the Hair Raiser, arctic express, whirly bird, minetrain, raging rapids and the dragon. As mentioned, there are also other live exhibits that you can visit to view animals- these all seem to be well looked after and happy. There are plenty of places to eat- food is more expensive than most other places in Hong Kong but this is to be expected in a big theme park. We had lunch in the Bayview caf\u00e9 which has lovely views over the bay and the food was delicious.Be prepared to do A LOT of walking and set aside a whole day as the park is huge but well worth trekking around to see as much as possible. I would definitely advise booking tickets in advance to beat the queues at the entrance and also opt for fast track tickets too. The fast track tickets mean that you can skip the main queue for 7 attractions- we saved these for the big rides and the cable cars and saved so much time queuing up. Ocean Park is definitely not to be missed when in Hong Kong!"

There aren't a huge amount of rides here. So we managed to do 3 rides before it started to rain. What you wouldn't believe is once it starts to rain they stop all of the rides. It's a tropical country. It rains here all the time. I went to customer relations to ask if when the rides will start again. And they say \"when it stops raining\" at this time it has virtually stopped. So the animals are good, the food is expensive but that's expected.

Most zoo animals in small and cramped conditions, however the park was very clean and tidy and staff were friendly and helpful.Full review:We purchased our tickets from the MTR station tourist information which was a wise move as not only were they cheaper, but we avoided the long ticket booth queues upon arrival. Traveling to the park via bus was quick, easy and cheap so it is certainly a good way to travel.Being the holidays, the park was very busy all day however the queues for the attractions were certainly not as long as they could have been. Most of the staff on rides moved quickly to load the rides to keep the queues moving. Generally, the staff and the appearance of the park was the biggest highlight. All staff we interacted with were friendly and helpful, and the park's appearance was impeccable throughout.In terms of the ride offering, excluding the fairly new Hair Raiser ride, all other attractions are dated by any countries standards. The Hair Raiser ride is fantastic, however apart from that, the park is lacking any sort of attraction that can't be found at another park elsewhere.Regarding the animals, the only show we saw was the Sealion and Dolphin show where the park have opted for the theatrical approach rather than an educational one. Other shows I have seen in the UK are of far better quality where the trainer explains how the animal is cared for and explains some facts about them. At Ocean Park, the trainer acted as a confused explorer who was bemused to see dolphins splashing around. Neither of us found it amusing, and in my opinion it failed to pay due respect to the amazing creatures that were part of the show.Regarding the rest of the animals, some enclosures seemed okay (when comparing to other zoos) yet others were either very overcrowded or severely cramped. The most shocking of which was the Sealion enclosure in the North/South pole encounter area - two Sealions crammed into a space that was far smaller than the average swimming pool.The food we had was expensive and poor, however in an amusement park, this is to be expected."

Not a fan of heights so I took the Ocean Express train back down. If you have any mobility issues you may find it hard to get around up at the summit. Lots of hills to contend with. The waiting times for rides were on average 10-20 minutes. The exhibits are ok. Given the size of the park I thought the enclosures would be bigger. Expected more animals and less displays. The dolphins were cool but too much talking by the presenter. Went to a number of shows but in some there was no English translation (bird show) or there was extremely limited English spoken too fast (seal feeding) so I had no idea what was going on until the presenters were waving and saying bye bye.

This place can get overrun with mainland tourists and there can be cultural misunderstandings but if you get there early and invest in the fastpasses which mean you can queue jump it is great! cable cars a must, what a view! children have to be 122cm tall for most rides, 133 for a couple of the big ones.The animals and aquariums appear well looked after and in good condition, my children enjoyed this part of the park a lot.The park is very spread out and there is plenty of walking so wear comfy shoes and try to go on a cooler day!"

This park is a combination of a zoo and theme park. There are so many animal attractions that you can easily spend 5 hours just looking at those. You can see penguins (my favorite), seals, dolphins, several pandas, an awesome aquarium, jelly fish - sea jelly spectacular, sharks - shark mystique, and more. If you want to go on the rides, good luck standing in line. It can take a good long time. Also, I recommend going to the Ocean Express first. Come back on the cable car. Usually, there isn't a line or at least there hasn't been when I left the other side at around 2 pm. Plan on getting to the park right when it opens usually at 10 am and plan on staying until around 4 or 5 pm. Have fun you'll love it if you really like animals!"

When going to ocean park the smart thing to do is buy your entry ticket before you go, also very handy would be a brolly, it keeps the sun and the rain at bay,---if you don't you will be in a Q in the heat for some time at the ticket counter, that's after you've stood in a Q for the bus to get there, The bus that takes you there goes from admiralty MTR station,If you don't want to Q for the rides or the cable car, for an extra charge you get 7 fast passes, we took them and it was worth it, -- it was 33 deg on the day we went and the fast pass was a great way of not standing in the heat for some time waiting to get on the attractions, ocean park was a much better day out than Disney, there are more rides and it's much bigger.-- coming back on the cable car at night was breathtaking -- when leaving the park be prepared for a Q for the bus back to. Admiralty station on the MTR, you can of course get a taxi --- they are currently building an MTR station to right outside the venue so in the future it will be much easier and quicker to get there, I only hope they can do something about the Q for ticket sales, the MTR will drop a lot more people than a few buses,"

It was delightful.Well worth a visit and so much to see and do.For the youngsters and young at heart are the roller coaster rides and fun rides. We didn't go on any but the people looked to be having tremendous fun and at some places you can spray water at unsuspecting ride goers on a water ride - fun for any age !!We visited all the exhibits, which was so interesting.We started with the panda's which are just super. We then headed for the aquarium which is great (the queue can be long and longer when raining as indoors so most people head there). We then took the train (definitely worth a ride ! Inside looks like a submarine and the journey is interesting) to the other side of the park. There you find a whole host of further interesting things to see and do.We visited the Poles and it's quite incredible to see the Pacific walrus and others, the shark mystique is incredible, the rainforest, just lots of great exhibits.To get back to the other side you can go by the train again or cable car - your choice and having done both would recommend both for enjoyment.This place caters for all, kids, bigger kids, grown ups and pensioners.There are places to get food and drink snacks. We stayed right until closing and they have a very interesting show to end the day.Would definitely recommend.We travelled there by bus from town (Island Hong Kong) and it was very easy. Bus's all waiting to take you back after closing (and before)."

If you are taking the bus to the theme park like most people do, be sure you have bought the entrance tickets beforehand as they don't allow people without entrance tickets to board the bus.There was a huge crowd from early morning so we thought all the rides will have long queues too but fortunately that is not the case. Most of the thrilling rides require us to queue on an average of 15-30 minutes only. The more thrilling the ride the shorter the queue, we did not have to queue up for The Flash at all, which I have to say is extremely exhilarating. Hair raiser is another nerve-racking ride. Don't try these rides if you get nauseous easily though.Moreover you can watch animals there like pandas, seals, penguins, walruses, sharks, dolphins etc. We did not watch the shows due to lack of time but if you're going with children it is worth a try.Food here is extremely expensive (HKD80 for a hot dog), if you get hungry you can get takeaways in a McD outlet here. Yes it's more expensive than those outside but still better than other stalls that sells hot dogs/meals. There are water coolers near McD to quench your thirst so there is no need to buy the pricey mineral water there (HKD15 for 500ml!). They check your bags before you enter the park so you can't bring heavy meals in from outside.Ocean park is highly recommended if you enjoy theme parks but Disneyland is above your budget. It's better to go on normal weekdays as the crowd is insane during weekends/holidays. Arrive early before 10am so you have ample time to enjoy the whole park."

Seems security standards at Ocean park are much more strict compared to others.Besides the attractions there are several animal shows, but this needs careful timing to make sure you are in the right place at the right time. Another disappointment was that when visiting the panda, there was no animal around\u2026Also food in the restaurant was very expensive for the quality received."

Great quality attraction with thrill rides and wildlife (including giant pandas !!!). Wildlife exhibits done really well.Penguins, sharks, seals, walruses, pandas, jellyfish etc etcMy top tips;1) Buy your tickets in advance from any 7Eleven store in the city thus avoiding the ticket queue.2) Get the taxi there for 10am opening. Taxi is about $60-70 from Causeway Bay, so very cheap.3) Head straight for the cable car base station and head up to the summit attractions first and then work your way back to base (by 2pm the park is heaving and all the big rides are at the top)4) on your way to the cable car base station stop at Ricky's Shack and buy \"jump the queue\" tickets at $150 per head (no child price).You will thank me for these - the queues get very long (1hr+) yet the priority access queues are complete empty. The tickets allow you (one) priority access entry to each of 7 of about 9 big rides. That's about $20 per ride to save an hour on each...5) use one of your 7 priority accesses to jump the line onto the cable car at the base station and get to the summit early and before the crowds. I suggest to dave another for your return journey on the cable car (you will be hot and tired by mid afternoon and not feel like another hour long queue)6) IMO, the best big rides are the dragon, mine train, hair raiser, raging river, rapids, abyss. Plus arctic blast for younger ones.7) choose your first ride and go their straight away. If you are at the summit early, as I have suggested then you won't need to use one of your priority accesses.8) after your first ride, go to the south pole and then north pole experiences to see the fantastic penguin seal and walrus exhibits9) thereafter, do you other choice of rides as you want. Use all your priority accesses except for one if you don't want to queue for the cable car back.10) take lots of bottled water. It is hot here and water is expensive. There are various food outlets all seem OK. There is a McDonald's if you must..11) the snow cone from the ice cream sellers (basically a form of slush puppy) was a good way of keeping the kids hydrated and cool $45 each12) save time on the return to the base resort for the pandas and aquarium. The pandas are a must do.13) get taxi home. Bit of a queue but OK. mtr or bus as alternatives (cheaper).All in all - a fab day !!!"

The theme park is separeated by a mountian range, each side can accesed by a cable car or a train. I recomend the train because its faster while for the cable car you have to wait around 1 hour. Rides have a much shorter wainting time than Disneyland and are frankly better, more intense and most important fun. The aquarium and the pandas really makes this place better than Disneyland. The shows are entertaining and amazing. The animals seem happy with everything. Also make sure to check the weather, most of the park is outdoors so BEWARE!"

Recommend to take a shuttle bus no. 629 from exit B MTR Admiralty, it costs HKD 10.6 (around that!), try to come early as the queue is long! The park is open at 10AM.The park is divided into 2 sections (Waterfront and The Summit) connected by both Cable Car and express train. We came on Sunday (which may be the worst day!) at 930am and The queue in front of the gate was already soooo long, and with NO queue manner from the guests, get ready to defend your position or let them go first :))Try to get the tickets online and e-ticket on your mobile is acceptable. Express access sold separately with addition of HKD 150, and you need to print it to A4 paper or you gotta queue at the ticket counter to print it, don't forget to bring the CC you use to purchase the ticket, yes, they asked for it for some reason!).The summit area is more interesting for adults with some \"crazy\" rides as the Hair Raiser, The dragons,Mine Train, etc. Ask for the map on the ticket counter. But better you make list of what you wanna ride as the park is huge, may take you a full day! We only use the express tickets twice (at Grand Aquarium and Wheel) only, as the Q at other rides were kinda acceptable (compared with the Q at Universal Studio Singapore on weekens!). Foods and drinks are more expensive, it cost HKD 28 for a water bottle. Better bring your water bottle and there are some water dispenser machines available. Unfortunately, you can't bring food inside of the park, Yes, the security guys in front of the gate checked it!Went there at early August and it was superrrrr Hot, not many places got shade, so put on the sunblock, bring sunglasses and maybe hat.."

Transportation to ocean park also very easy; just take the MTR direct to Admiralty station, once reach station just follow the signage to \"ocean park\" city bus no#629. The bus station very well organize and just follow the queue. The bus at the morning session are more frequent which about 5 min once bus depart. One thing that need to do first before depart to ocean park is to purchase the ticket first. There are a few place to purchase, one of it is at the MTR Admiralty station on the way to the bus station, there is a counter that sell ticket. But I have bought the cheapest ticket compare to other is from travel agent office near Nathan (I not sure that allow to mention the name of the travel agent here, anyhow if anyone of you want to know I can personally tell). Once ticket purchase, the next thing that you must have is the ocean park officials apps. You must download the apps before go there, once reach there, you can connect the apps with ocean park server. The purpose of this apps is allow you to book 3 of the most attraction that you like most by follow the given time; means you can by pass the long queues if you reach the attraction time per what have you book. The most front station is the the aquarium which is the longest queue, 45 min. This station is best to put to last station and book the time. Read the map and know which attraction to go first, time planning is very important. Seeing that the MTR station also in progress of construction, when this station complete, it will be more convenient to all. Overall this place very nice for kids, take picture with mascot no need to have long queues as in Disneyland. Enjoy!"

It is a long beautiful, scenic ride.If you have any walking issues or you are not in great condition, or if you are handicapped the park was built very poorly. Getting off rides you have to walk around a lot. It is not easy for someone who is in shape. LOTS of steep hills, and walks for 2 rides on the mid part. Although it was an fabulous experience, so if you up to the challenge.... I would recommend it.Some rides have great views of the harbor."

But nowadays there are so many water parks and smaller amusement and theme parks that it's almost not necessary to go to these big huge parks anymore. There were a lot of Chinese Tourists and the wait for every ride is at least 45 minutes. However, for an additional HK$128 per person ( Adult or Child same price ), we got priority that helped getting in front of the crowds. The kids also complained a lot as the rides were so short that just as you started enjoying the ride, it would come to an end. Like less than 2 minutes per ride!!!"

It was a hot day (it was a few days before the storm - signal #8 according to their weather report). We took a taxi from our hotel and it was a fast ride and before I knew it we were on the park's main gates. I was a bit happy because the last time I visited the park was like 20++ years ago? (Lol) We had to trudge on stairs for a few minutes before there was several escalators that would carry us to the main gate. The one thing I noticed when we were on the escalator is that they were building an MTR station just for Ocean Park and they are also expanding the area. We went in and the first thing we did was to grab a map. The place is huge with lots of people milling around. We walked around and one of the things we tried was riding the cable car. The line was long and you have to wait in the heat but the ride was worth it. Thankfully there was no strong wind but we all were kind of nervous as we went higher in the mountain. It was really high but the view was spectacular and it was worth the ride up. We took some picture and we went to the aquarium. We also went to see the dolphin show but we were late so the seats are full. I ate pineapple ice at HKD$25/piece and squid skewer for HKD$ 40. Water is around HKD$40. (Kind of steep if you ask me.) They have this machine were you insert HKD$10 and a bronze coin will come out with a certain design, there are 4 designs to choose from. There were only a few food joints that was open and they serve really good cold cuts with rice and the serving is large, good for 2 people. It was an okay day. The thing is there were not enough benches with roof for people to rest when they are tired especially for senior citizens.Also they should have a transportation cart when the places visitors wanted to go is too far from their current location, especially for senior citizen. I saw several senior citizens sitting down on pavements and in the shade because there's no benches for them to sit on. Please address this concern. We rode the submarine back to the main park and it was fun. It was an okay experience but I was kind of disappointed that I wasn't able to go to the other rides since I had to tend to my mom. Hopefully this review will be read by the park administrators so they can fix the problems that I pointed out."

We went on a Saturday. Took MTR to Admiralty station. After you exit the turnstiles, head for exit B (it's clearly marked on the direction signs in the station.) There's a stall selling discounted tickets right before you exit the station, Adults HK 355, children 180. Got to Admiralty station around 9:30, then took Bus ride to Ocean Park (can pay with Octopus card) and entered the park a little before 10:00. As other reviews have suggested, go straight to take the cable car up to the Summit area. We then went straight to the Adventure Land area. There was zero wait for the Mine Train. We then did the Raging River, again zero wait time. Rode it 3 times.Came back to catch the 11:30 dolphin show at Ocean Theater. (Even caught a ride on the Ocean Park Tower since there was a few minutes before the show started). The Shark Mystique exhibit is worth a look. Actually, all of the indoor animal exhibits were a nice air conditioned respite from the heat, in addition to being interesting. Avoid the Flying Swing if you have motion sickness. It will ruin the rest of your morning. Be prepared to leave your backpack/loose items in an open shelf area. Ferris wheel is close by. There is a McDonalds at the Marine World area which is probably the most economical food you will get at the park. After you get your food, you can eat it at the shaded eating area which is nearby (it looks like a tent on the map). After an extended lunch break (to recover from the aforementioned flying swing), went to see Sea Jelly and Chinese Sturgeon exhibits. (Passing by the shark exhibit, there were actually lines at that point, whereas when we went in the morning there was no wait time). Exhibits were crowded, but no wait time to enter. Moved on to Rainforest for The Rapids (30 minute wait). Be aware of the minimal height requirements for the rides. A family ahead in the line didn't realize this until they got closer to the height check area, this after having waited in line for some 10 minutes. Thrill Mountain bumper car ride (30 minute wait) has minimal height, children below that cannot drive the car and can only be passenger with adult. The bumper cars are harder to control than you think, the steering can keep you stuck. Take the Ocean Express train back down to the lower part of park. It's designed to look like a submarine, so a better place to stand is in the center of the car under the overhead screens (there will be images appearing in them) rather than by the windows which just give a view of the tunnel. If you plan on visiting while the SpongeBob play area is still there (goes until end of August-ish), bring a change of clothes or swimsuit. It is a get-completely-wet zone. Even has giant bubble pool that the kids can slosh around in. Recommend you stick around for the Symbio water/lights show which starts at 7:30 pm. It's about 10 minutes, and has some surprise elements which made the show quite entertaining. My 9-year old says of Ocean Park \"it was AWESOME\".(If you need a place to eat after bus drops you off at Admiralty, we ate at Fairwood Cafe located in the tower across the street on the 2nd floor. HK fast food restaurant. Hubby said it was surprisingly one of the best sweet and sour chicken he's has.)"

Well, I brought my toddlers with me and they enjoyed a bit of here and there but with the ticket price, it's not worth it for small kids. Most rides have minimum height requirement, so most toddlers wont be able to enjoy even the basic ones. I enjoyed the park very much as it is beautiful, as it's close to the ocean. From Lantau Island, we took the MTR to Admiralty station. Just outside the station, there is a ticket booth that sells both Ocean Park and bus tickets to Ocean Park. First bus starts at 9:00 am and last is 4:00 pm with an interval of every 10 minutes. I suggest you buy the tickets there. I bought Ocean Park tickets online, and didn't have a printer to print them. So, I opt to pick them up at the Ocean Park itself. I had to queue up for quite sometime as they don't have a special ticket booth for 'pick up' tickets only ( which I think they should!!).Anyhow, we got our tickets, and went to take the map and rent a stroller for HKD$50. Cable car was pleasant with a spectacular view. You can cut the queue if you have the FasTrack Pass. Most of the queues are long so I suggest bring snacks. Halal food stalls are available. We got down via tram instead of the cable car, so we get to experience both rides. Some suggested that you should go up via tram and get down via cable car- it's up to you. we took the tram because the queue is shorter than cable car's. WIFI was also available and I downloaded the Ocean Park app to get the showtimes for different shows at different venues. Planning is important as you need to walk for a far bit to catch these shows. In a nutshell, it was a fun visit. It was my second time there, first without kids and recently with kids. I will return- perhaps when they are a bit elder and taller!"

Make sure, moreover, you are in good shape; otherwise, you might end up in an emergency room due to the heat, humidity and long-distances you have to walk between exhibits.Should you pay extra to avoid long queues? We thought about that one and decided not to, and were happy in the end that we didn't pay extra because the longest line we faced was 20 minutes right at the beginning in order to enter the big aquarium. We went on a Friday so I guess that accounts for the absence of large numbers of people. We waited no more than 10 minutes for all major attractions, including the outstanding Hair Raiser roller coaster. The only time the queue jumping pass would've come in handy was right at the end of our visit at closing time when close to everybody in the park lined up to get on the great cable car ride back to the park exit. We took the cable car to the upper half of the park in the morning, and intended to take it back down but were not willing to wait an hour or so to do so; so we ended up taking the train through the tunnel, which entailed a waiting time of about two minutes.If you do go in the Hong Kong summer, take note that you can find air-conditioned relief in all of the public toilets as well as in many of the exhibits, such as the fantastic panda pen.Most of the animals we came across seemed to be happy, except for the one snowy owl I saw that'll probably never fly again.Don't forget some of the largely overlooked exhibits, such as the wonderful goldfish one.Your correspondent hadn't visited a themepark for years prior to coming to Ocean Park and was uncertain whether he would enjoy himself.At the end of the day, he was a very happy customer. The admission price is very reasonable and with that one pass, you can do everything. The cable car ride from the bottom half to the upper half reveals the fantastic location of Ocean Park; the views on the way up to the top are incredible and likewise when you get to the top.The new Ocean Park MTR station should be open pretty soon, so accessing the venue from your downtown hotel will be easier henceforth. Moreover, the already massive park is getting even bigger with an extension under construction.When we visit Hong Kong again, we will be sure to visit Ocean Park once again."

Beyond being a tourist spot and a key recreational center for tourists and visitors alike, what is unique with Ocean Park is that it provides the visitor with a deeper understanding of mother earth, its oceans and the need for humanity to conserve, protect and keep our world clean. The park educates us on the wonders of the animal kingdom and that we need to clean up and protect our environment because we are not the only inhabitants."

The rides aren't the best or the biggest but they are sufficient . It's better for younger children to be honest . The best part about it is that it's all in one place , where else can you see penguins and pandas all in the same place . Take swimwear as well as their is a splash park for younger children ! Getting there is easy , take the train then there is a bus that goes every 5 minutes from the station to ocean park , it only goes there so you can't get off at the wrong stop etc . If you are going in summer , dress in shorts etc and there really isn't much shade or places to hide fromThe sun .I would recommend this over Disney land due to the animals and the cheaper entrance price !Enjoy your day there !

Overall the park is very nice but the only thing I would complain about is the aquarium. I do not believe in Zoos or aquariums but for any reason I believe they should expand some enclosures as some felt very small. They have two large walrus in a very small enclosure and I couldn't help but feel sorry for them. May be they will change it one day or release them back to where they belong.The park is very nice."

The penguin area was good, and cool. The panda was eating bamboo shoots right in front of the enclosure so got some good views. And the aquarium, though not as Shanghai, was nevertheless spectacular with everything from a ranfe of sea horses to Manta Rays swimming overhead.

It's one of the biggest parks we've been to and would always recommend it to my friends and family. By the way, I scratched my legs in one of the marble edge outside the park, their First Aid Team was so quick, located in a strategic location ( entrance) and it was like magic, that it didn't even bruise after few hours they had spray ( I guess medicine) my legs.

If your home country don't have Ocean Park, going here is a must!In our country Philippines, we also have Ocean Park and its almost the same as HK's Ocean Park. Except for the Cable Car.It's nice to explore sea creatures through out the Park. Go ride the Cable Car of course!"

We lived on a boat near here for a few years and when we went back after having kids, got a season ticket.It's like a fishy-themed disney crossed wit a zoo. i used to work in UK zoos so a lot of things there we didn't do in the UK/ EU but its very entertaining for todllers upwards.Things do/ have changed and will have changed since last time I visited HK but there are usually:lots of fish/ tanks, some with some educational info on. My eldest when a toddler loved the jellyfish tubular tank gallery with music (Sky!) & colour changing lights, the goldfish gallery (lots of odd species) and the turtle bowls, the red & giant pandas (hugging their refrigerated rocks) and the acrobatic shows.The seasonal stuff is always good too and although i never went as Halloween is my busiest time of year, other face & body painters I know are flown in to decorate the actors at the annual scarefest.If you are new to HK/ China be aware there are coachloads of mainlanders coming to this, whi will want to touch/ hold/ semi-kidnap any western child (especially blondes/ red heads) for spoiling/ kisses/ photo opportunities. it is very sweet but scarey if you don't expect it, happened every single visit with us.Food cafes all over, varies, we liked the squashed squid vendor and the mat ball thingys. The skyline varied too, some kids loved it others panicked.Very enjoyable day, lots to see, and over the other side of the mountian is a bird park etc too we never made it to that as often... Do take shade/ hats etc as a lot of walking in hot sun on a clear day!"

We bought tickets for the same day , but the tickets did not show up in the mail fast enough. So , I tried cancelling the ticket by dialling the service line. The english option ... no one picked up ....thrice! The mandarin option was picked up instantly and I had them cancelled the tickets. The line if you buy on spot is long ...yes... but it moved swiftly. Cable car rides were good! There were no queue up when we were there and we waited 10 minutes for the ride down . The animals look healthy and well taken care of. You won't feel sorry or guilty when you see them. The rides ... we didn't get to ride many because the park is just too huge! But they look fun and the queue more humane ... I bet its only 5-10 minutes per ride. There are rides for older kids /teens.There were many shades and restaurants. Also, ocean park do allow you to bring food and drinks in , they are not as strict as disneyland. Go there , my kiddos actually prefer ocean park than disneyland!"

The pandas are obviously a bit disturbed and annoyed from all the noise. Tip: avoid the rainy season. Advice: Do NOT use flash on the aquariums pleaaase! And be quiet at the panda area.

I bought the express pass seeing that it only cost an additional HKD150 and it proved useful. 2 of the rides broke down on the day i was there, but they resumed after a while. Some of the better rides include the Hair Raiser roller coaster, Mine Train roller coaster, Rev Booster (fast spinning ride), The Dragon roller coaster and The Flash (upside down spinning thrill ride). The Abyss (tower ride that goes up and down) was disappointing with only one small drop, not worth sitting if the queue is long. The viking ride looked pretty small and lame hence i skipped it. For a real theme park lover, i would rate ocean park as a 6/10 as the rides are not THAT scary. Theyre pretty enjoyable, but nothing really impressive. The aquarium was ok, but nothing spectacular really. If you've been to Singapore's SEA Aquarium, this one really pales in comparison. Variety is limited, nothing very special. The dolphin/sea lion show was pretty plain as well."

Getting there for us was by bus, which we caught from the terminals at Star Ferry. There are many service available from all areas so getting there is easy and cheap. They were building a new MTR Station and rail network to Ocean Park while we were there, so in the near future getting there will be even easier. The park is divided into two sections, and gaining access to either section is done by cable car or a funicular, which is a themed cable train. This is because one section is at sea level at the foot of a mountain and the other section is on top of the mountain. The views from the upper section is worth the entry price alone. It is also where all the great rides are. There are many rollercoasters, and some are located on the edges of the mountain which adds to the thrills, because you are quite high up and overlooking the South China Sea. There are a large assortment of rides available for all types of thrill seekers. There is also a section that has old style challenge games. It was noisy with the operators calling out and ringing bells, but was fun and exciting. The animal exhibits are second to none, and in plentiful supply. There were the Giant Panda's, Asian Animal Exhibit, Arctic Fox, Emperor Penguins, Seals, etc etc. There was even an exhibit on Gold Fish which I though would be rather boring, but was really quite interesting and worth a visit. We visited during the Halloween period, which is an exciting time to visit this park. The staff dress in costume and they have themed areas to celebrate this event. In the afternoon we noticed more and more staff that were in amazing costumes and make up, wandering around all areas of the park. They were all available to have their photos taken with us. There is a lot of different types of restaurants and food outlets for all tastes and budgets. We always eat at the Panda Cafe located in the lower section of the park. Good Hong Kong food at good prices. Entry price to the park is very good value considering the size of the place, and what it offers. Line ups to the rides can sometimes be long, but don't take long to get through due to them running things very efficiently. All exhibits and rides are included in the entry price. Souvenir shops are everywhere and offer great products at very reasonable prices. Food prices are not much more than what you would pay outside the park. Don't be scared by the crowds. Everything is run efficiently and designed for high volumes of people. We have been twice and look forward to our next visit."

Well-loved among locals and tourists, the Park is a destination worth marking a day or two on your itinerary for. Make sure to pick up a show schedule when you arrive at the park so you can plan sightseeing around fantastic shows! The park is divided into two main sections. The main entrance is on the Waterfront (lower) side and is linked to the main section on the Summit (top) via a scenic cable car ride and a marine-themed funicular train called the Ocean Express . Cross the Park via cable car and view the entire 870,00 square meters from above! On top part they have mostly all the scary rides as lower side they have the panda and penguins zoo where you get to know some of Asia's most precious native animals at the Giant Panda Adventure.

The queues were also fairly long for those rides that were open (a number were shut for maintenance). In comparison with the theme parks in Australia, Gold Coast, the rides and shows seemed quite old and underwhelming. The highlight however turned out to be the many wildlife displays such as the jellyfish, pandas and many different aquariums. If this is of interest to you then it would be worth the visit."

My favorite had to be the penguin exhibit. They had so many penguins in and out of the water. We also enjoyed their dolphin show. Don't miss it!They had a ton of rides. There was a huge, scary, roller coaster that I didn't go on. People seemed to enjoy the river rafting ride. I just rode the ferris wheel, which had a very nice view. Ocean Park consists of two parts. When you pass through the entrance, you're at the bottom part. To get to the upper part, you take the cable cars or railway cars. I prefer the cable cars because you get to see the beautiful scenery. It is a little scary when you're in the car and it's dangling from so high up. The only thing that sucked for me was the food. It was horrendous. I got a chili dog and onion rings. I just ate the dog because the bun was hard. The onion rings were stale, soggy, and cold. Everyone complained about their food. I guess people don't go there to eat. From what I saw, the place is under heavy construction. They are currently building a hotel and more rides. I can't wait to go back when it's done."

Carry your makeshift raincoat or else be ready to buy one for HKD 40 if u don't wish to get wet while taking the Rapid river ride. U can take the ocean express to come down. Our kids enjoyed the sponge bob experience. Carry extra change for kids and their swimming costume. U can easily miss half the rides as it's physically not possible to see the whole park in one day. Very tiring. Summer months are extremely humid as such pls carry lots of water as water in the park is for HKD 28. Both Disney and ocean park charge exorbitant prices for food and water.

Also, it would be wise to choose and know what you want to do against what can be left off.Oft asked question - Disney or Ocean park?Value for Money - Ocean parkActivities and rides - Ocean parkMore full family entertainment - Ocean parkBut if you are a Disney fan then i guess you can't miss that either!"

Lot of options as such, but different sections are just too far away from each other. Avoid very hot days as it's all in open and a lot of walk. Need one full day to do justice to it."

We loved the polar adventure, where we could explore long tusked walruses,arctic foxes,spotted seals and huge number of penguins and many other extraordinary polar animals.  The waterfront and summit areas are connected by cabel car and ocean express train.The cable car experience was very joyful with mesmerizing view of the entire Ocean park.  The thrilling adventure of \"The Thrill Mountain\" especially Hair Raiser, Rev rooster ride and floorless roller coaster are a must try. We loved the interactive journey at giant panda adventure,Chinese alligators,small clawed otters,beautiful variety of gold fishes and vibrant and different species of colourful birds. There are various other equally beautiful things to explore in Ocean Park like Old Hong Kong Memories, different kinds of sharks,Rainforest with most fascinating animals in the world especially world's smallest monkey and world's largest rodent. Overall it's totally a fun filled adventurous trip and was worth every Penny of my HK$150. NOTE: Buy tickets online from asiatravel.com to avoid queues and better prices."

They have a lot of cute animals, panadas are sleeping and eating all the time while they have a new exhibit for koalas and kangaroo now. Koalas are really cute. Though they dun have programs for touching koalas, we can meet them in Hong Kong is already great enough. Roller coasters and rides in Ocean Park are more exciting compared to HK Disneyland, while they have an area for kids to play rides and I think that is quite thoughtful. And in summer, after lining up for roller coasters for a long time, you can get into the exhibits to look at animals and enjoy aircon for a short time. I think Ocean Park is definitely a must-go place for teenagers."

If the weather is hot, taking a refreshing walk to visit the penguins will cool you off. Catch the public transport as the double decker bus ride gives you a great look at this awesome city. A must if in Hong Kong. The mine car roller coaster gives you an amazing view of the city - even if you don't do roller coasters (I had never been on one) put this on your list. Have fun."

Train is much faster and give decent experience for thrillers it would be good to take Gandola however, it takes some 25 mins.

The buses from Admiralty station were regular, quick and cheap.

The best thing to do is to buy tickets at the train station or beforehand from a verified retailer. I couldn't buy it beforehand because I had a 10% voucher I wanted to use and this could only be redeemed at the actual park. After 30 minutes of waiting, we finally got in. The beginning of the park started with an aquarium section which was similiar to Sydney aquarium with a variety of fish, Sharks, sting rays, sea horses, octopuses and a few other marine life. It was nice in here because of the air conditioning and it was dark and peaceful.there are other sections of the park such as the panda section where there are two pandas enclosed. As pandas sleep for most of the day, we didn't see these two as they were asleep in the back. (Only saw them via cc tv camera).There was another section a few blocks away which housed one 11 year old panda. This panda was awake and asleep and we saw some movement which was cute! Other sections in this area was an Australian animals part and a little area which has a jumping castle + water like thing for kids.You can travel to the next part of the park via ocean express which is a pretend submarine which is actually a train. Or you can catch the cable car up. There was a 30 minute wait for a cable car so we just decided to hop on the fake submarine. The wait for that was only 5 minutes.It took us to the other area which has theme parks, games where you can win prizes and some more restaurants including mc donalds!North Pole encounter with seals, artctic encounter with 50+'penguins , shark mystique with sting rays and sharks to see.I charged my mobile phone at one of the mobile phone charging lockers for $20HK PER hour. Went over time by 10 minutes to go and pick it up and it charged me $20 extra \"overtime\".There's heaps of rides (roller coaster, Ferris wheel etc) throughout the other 2/3 of the park such as a ride which is on water and you get splashed and wet, a ride that goes up very high perhaps 200m high and it gives you a nice view of the city. It's not really a scary ride because it goes up and down quite slowly. There's rides for children and a lot of thriller type of rides too. Most rides you have to line up for about 10 -20 minutes depending on the ride . We went on the feris wheel around 615 and there wasn't much of a line so waited for a few spins and got onI spent most of the day there which included rest stops, eating and taking my time looking at the pandas and different animals for a while. I ended up leaving the park at 7pm.Some things to take note for the day, bring a portable charger, water bottles, hat, sunscreen and comfortable walking shoes."

All adequate and reasonably clean, with reasonable lineups mostly, but not particularly interesting compared to, say, Sea World in the US. Not worse, just not especially impressive or anything. One beef: we arrived early and most rides didn't open until 11 AM, which was annoying."

Its a must go in Hing Kong, with a lot of activities and roller coasters. There are cheap bus service from the nearest MTR station.There are prime shows with dolphins and sea lions, which is the prime attraction. There is also a White Panda breeding within the park. Lots of sea lions and penguins also to look after when you are inside.The water rides are very good and not be missed. There is also a nice cable car over looking the ocean. This park over the hills provides a great view of the ocean from almost all ends of the park. The Australian section displays some exotic animals as well. Overall this place is a very pictorial and enjoyable place for kids and is a must go in Hong Kong."

Being a theme park, there are some areas of high traffic such as waiting lines, some rides and the tram going to the top of the mountain. Even though there are usually lines it is very organised and coordinated well that you don't wait too long. Staff may be a bit pushy or seem unfriendly but that's their way of getting things going. Our kids loved the night show. It was a great end to a long and tiring day. Sitting there to watch the lights and fireworks was spectacular. You will however need to wait till night time for it to start. Towards the end of the show we started heading to the exit to avoid crowds pushing and waiting too long for the taxi.

Eventually it looks like the MTR (trains) will go right to the entrance of Ocean Park but we took an inexpensive taxi.I went there because I had seen on youtube some people who did some of the rides and they looked amazing but not so amazing as the views and, boy, the views are truly amazing! This has to be one of the best parks in the world for sightseeing!It's divided into two, the animals and the rides. To get from one to the other, which is the other side of a mountain by the way, there are two choices ... if walking is a third I'd say don't! The two choices are the cable car and, wow, what a vision or, the not so scenic railway through the mountain which, to be honest, is a little tacky. The queue lines for the cable car seemed significantly longer than the train but it is a must do experience (unless you don't like heights in which case it would be mega dumb)If you ever, like me, had 'seeing panda in China' on your bucket list, this is the place for you, they have rather a lot of them.The aquarium is awesome too.They seemed a little lacking in the likes of polar attractions but I can forgive them that.If I am honest, I'd say that this park, were it transported to the US, would knock Seaworld out of business, it is so much better.The rides are not the best thrill rides in the world but a good time anyway.Plenty of eating choices from fast food to sit down meals and equivalent budget levels tooWe didn't watch the dolphin show but they have a dolphin centre where they can be seen anyway.Everywhere is a long walk and a lot of hills. Build up stamina for several weeks beforehand if pushing someone in a wheelchair.We were there a whole day, it's just so restful going around it."

My son had a great time going for the Hair Raiser ride. And his other favourites since he was a kid. Unfortunately, his favourite log ride was close as it was being renovated.My advice is to go when the Park just opens. No lines and you could get into the rides without any hassles. However, after 12 pm, you have loads of mainland Chinese tourists coming in tour buses. The lines to practically every attraction was incredibly long. So we decided to leave at about 1 pm when the crowds really started to surge into the Park."

Even though we missed a few parade shows because we had wanted take the cable cars that had a very long queue of people, it was all worth-it. The view was amazing and my son loved it. The aquarium had a long queue as well and so a limited number of people were allowed at certain times.

Most of the rides are not terribly sophisticated but more adequate than thrilling. The Hair Raiser was the exception albeit quite short (lasting approximately 1.5 minutes) but nonetheless, quite fun. Some of the queues were quite long so I recommend paying for the Fast Trak which gives you priority and brings you to the front of the line. We ate at the Terrace and the food was quite bad and overpriced but hey, they have a captive audience. Ocean Park is a nice place for the family to get away from their everyday life and just be a kid again."

Good for edu trip and children with higher age. If kids need something characteristic and cute---> go to Disney land btw. Ticket is cheaper for OC park. Take bus or MTR to Admiralty station and follow B exit(I think) or with the sign that shown like 'Bus to ocean park'.

Soon after arriving we realized that all of the best rides have height restrictions from 132cms up which meant that we couldn't go on any of them. There were a few things our kids could go on but I recommend you check the restrictions before you go to save disappointment.That being said, we did still have an enjoyable day. The train and bus to and from the park were easy and cheap. Once we arrived there were no queues to get in (we got our tickets from the 7-11 at the train station for full price but we did go past one place selling a bit cheaper on the way out of Admiralty station). We paid about $200AUD for 2 adults and 2 children.There is an English map and guide on a stand once inside. There are friendly staff everywhere eager to help with any enquiries. There is an option to pay an extra $150HKD pp to fast track 7 of the main rides (we didn't bother due to height restrictions).It was a really hot day but there are places where you can escape into air conditioning. Although it seemed like there were lots of people the lines weren't bad at all ranging from 5-20mins. We could see the really long queues set up which obviously get used during peak times and were grateful it was a quieter day today.We took the train up the mountain and the cable car down and didn't have to wait for either. Both were highlights of our day. There are lots of restaurants (including McDonalds) ranging in price but we recommend bringing as much food and water as you can to save money.Ocean Park is massive!!! It is spread over such a sparse area on a mountain so lots of walking is unavoidable. There are lots of long escalators to help you get up and down most of the hills but we were absolutely exhausted by the end of the day. The kids struggled with this.I'm giving Ocean Park 4 stars for the excellent service and efficiency in accommodating so many people. Lots of interesting things to see and a good variety of rides. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because compared to home the height restrictions are too high and this meant we missed out on all of the best rides. Back home our youngest can get on nearly all of the big rides.Totally recommend but remember to research before you go."

It is huge place so don't spend a lot of time gazing around at one place as you might not be able to look around the entire park in a day. Make it a two day trip if you have the time. Lots of variety to eat as well along with few healthy items as well like the frozen pineapple candy and frozen watermelon. There are not many baby care rooms most of which are occupied forever. So I used the ladies washroom to change my baby diaper. But it is an amazing place with better thrill rides than Disneyland for sure. You will love it. You will want to come back again !!!"

For all indian tourist, veg food is available at clowning restaurant in the adventure land.

Getting there was easy because there were directions from the MTR station. In the park, the aquarium was not better than others in other countries. However, the North Pole and South Pole exhibition was amazing as well as other exhibition. I had never been to very close encounter with the Penguins as here. May was not the best month to visit Hong Kong because it was to warm for outdoor activities. However, there were very short queues at every ride we got in. We took a leave from the hot weather into the cooler exhibition every now and then through out the day at the Ocean Park."

There's a lot more attractions here than in Disneyland, and everything's a treat. Aside from the gigantic aquarium, make sure you visit the sharks, pandas, penguins, arctic foxes, and the seals.

The whole park is set upon a mountain which is very cool but sometimes you look at rides and they become quite scary hanging tracks over cliffs. The park is clean and very large. The cable cars are extremely good which are you from the entrance and over the mountain. The shows are good. The rides are plenty and the whole place seems a good day out. The panda house is brilliant and you can even go and see koala bears. I really did enjoy my time here but the only thing I found a little poor was the price on the food outlets. It becomes quite expensive when eating at parks. Overall a great day out. And just to add one more thing. I would say 2 day is plenty of time to do the park.

All the staff are really friendly, my only criticism is there was literally 1 person working at the McDonald's restaurant so it took us half an hour to queue! animals are very well looked after and it is clear that they take safety precautions seriously as there was a serious thunderstorm during our visit and they wouldn't reopen any of the rides until they had thoroughly tested etc. My dreams came true when I saw a panda for the first time here, what an experience!

The rides are good and there is almost no queue on a weekday. Recommended. Pro tips: 1. Get a park map near the entrance 2. Ride the Ocean Express train up to the summit where the thrill rides are in the morning - then take the cable car down and enjoy the view. 3. The park is big - do hit the big rides first. There's 3 roller coasters, the Abyss ride and don't miss Flash.4. When tired, head down to the aquarium and take a break!5. Food inside the Polar restaurant is acceptable in quality but don't order the pizza - it's no good. Do eat there though - the restaurant has a cut section so you can view the Penguins. We were lucky to catch them during feeding too! It's pricey with a min spend of HKD100/pax too. But worth the view. Cheers and enjoy the park!"

If you're bringing your luggage with you, you need to rent a locker, HK$60 for a small one and HK$100 for a jumbo sized one, expensive! Food is way cheaper in the kiosks than in the restos, so find those kiosks.

If ya don't mind, here's a referral code (66SG6) where you can get ~$25hkd off.I just checked with a friend, even if you're a teacher of HK and get discounted tickets it's still not as cheap as Klook. I just don't know how much it is at the China Travel Service (so you should check)!You can also get the OP tickets cheaper $30 hkd then retail value at the mtr booths in Admiralty."

When crowded, it's not very pleasant. Enjoyed cooling off in the Wild River ride. Allow a full day because it is huge and there is a lot to see. Wear comfy shoes because you will walk miles."

Was almost impossible to withstand the heat .. so best is to visit the park when it's raining to avoid the sun. Please get yourself fast track which is 15 pounds per person valid for 7 entries. .otherwise you could be waiting at least half hour for most rides even on a weekday . The dolphin show is a must see so grab a seat half hour before the show starts . Excellent overall experience! To make it more enjoyable for visitors the park should open at 9 am instead of 10 and close a hour late than its usual closing times. Please note that Outside Food and drinks are not allowed and it's very costly inside to buy stuff. Rightly deserves to be in the top 10 !!!"

Aquarium is good but one has seen in other countries as well. They have a cute and efficient train service to go up to other places. Dancing Dolphins shows are at 12 pm, 3pm an 5 pm.

Rides: are definitely by far the best in HK, better than Disney and better than those temporary rides you find in the Central area that sometimes appear. Would recommend all the roller coaster rides.For Kids: it may not be as toddler and under 5-year-old friendly as Disney but there is still plenty of small rides and attractsions for them.For Food: there are plenty of restaurants, not cheap, but honestly I would skip the fancy stuff and stick with the fast food and put more hours on rides.Animals: The water attractions and the shows are a must. Work your schedule around those.View: the view on the cable car is really amazing, and you can take it to get to the middle kingdom side on the other end.Tip: The place gets very crowded, especially in weekends or festive times around December. If you want to be efficient you have to plan. That would include trying to line up to get in (my recommendation is to arrive either 45-60 min before the park opens to ensure you're the earliest - or arrive aroudn 15 min after it opens - there will be a queue but at least everything is moving by now). Its better to start with the rides starting FURTHEST from the entrance and work your way backwards."

The cable car is scenic and slow and while going up i would recommend this. Ocean express train takes less than 5 mins and i would recommend while coming back down.The Hill Top park has amazing fast and medium ride for ages above 8 years.We tried all and the best we liked were th Hair Raiser an amazing roller coaster ride.Total there are 3 roller coasters there in the above park and 2 -3 other rides.There is dolphin show also which is worth watching. there are 3 shows in day so you can choose the time you want to see it with your convenience."

There was only one McDonald, the few other food stalls offered only asian food.Short riding times of the attractions, but very long waiting times.Far too little quieter rides, or which are nice for couples.The aquarium was a huge disappointment:1) Only simple fishes2) Big fishes were to smallThe Panda House was really big, but inside you get another disappointment: ONLY two panda bears and two monkeys.When you reach the end of park after walking some hours in the burning sun, you must walk all the way back to the entrance.

The aquarium doesn't have too many large species- only few sting rays, a very big Manta Ray- that's the show stopper I guess, few hammer heads. Didn't find the penguins, the Arctic enclosure has spotted seals and walrus.Pretty well made with great viewing locations in the enclosures, with a cable car and a train inside, the train is quickest mode between the 2 sections of the park. The dolphin show is okay- if you have seen the ones in America or even Europe, you might be disappointed - has 4 dolphins and 2 seals in the show. I haven't seen others in Asia though. There is an enclosure for Kuala bear and kangaroo - the kid lived it! 65 hk $ for one way taxi from Pacific center in central area, however there is a train as well! "

We were with young kids and my mother in law who wasn't very mobile but we managed through the park. There were plenty of seats under shelter or small trees once you reach the summit. The view from the summit was beautiful and the rides were a hit with the kids. My MIL and kids enjoyed the penguin and arctic animal e closure at the summit. It was however a hilly climb once we were at adventure land, marine show and shark enclosure. So if you are with elderly who can't walk much, best to stay within the polar land (rides and arctic animal enclosure) near where the polar express train drop you off. The polar express train up to summit was a cool ride and turns up the imagination. A letdown was however the taxi stand as we depart. There were no benches at all. And what made it worse was the long wait for taxis willing to drive you back to Kowloon. There were two queues (one for those heading to kowloon and one for those within HK island). Very few cabs available for passengers heading to Kowloon. We ended up waiting in line for at least half an hour."

LiLi one of the resident pandas was having great fun during our visit, the keeper was surprised at how active he was, playing role poly with a sack bag down the hill in his enclosure and generally mucking about in the trees and tracks. We watched him for about half an hour. Had read they usually sleep so maybe we were just lucky. One other of the visiting pandas from China was active but nothing like Lili. The golden snub nosed monkey was also fun to watch. The gondola (cable car) ride was also fun."

We visited both Ocean Park and Disneyland, and while both were wonderful, we found Ocean Park to have a larger number of rides totally, as well as a larger number of thrilling rides. They also have beautiful creatures like the Panda, Koala bear, red panda, penguins, etc. Tips:> This seems obvious but try and visit on a weekday as queues are smaller.> Try and visit the animal exhibits earlier in the day. I visited the red panda in the evening and it was resting for the day so I could not catch a glimpse of it. > There is a McDonald's in the park for those interested - but it seemed very crowded.> Do take the cable car, the view is breathtaking. We rode it twice during our trip.> On the rides where you will get wet, you can purchase a rain poncho at the entrance of the ride. If you don't plan to buy one, bring a raincoat or a windcheater jacket with you.> You will spend the whole day there so plan accordingly - comfortable shoes and clothing, no loose jewelry if you plan to get on the rides.> There is a light, sound and fire show at the fountain at 8 PM so be there a little in advance to get good seats around it."

Rather than buying the ticket on spot, check with your hotel or agent for a ticket with meal combo. Tip: Try reaching early and without wasting time on the events in the valley, head straight for the cable car to the mountain. The park is divided into 2 parts- valley and mountain. 80% things to do are at the mountain. While descending take the train as the cable car queue may be a long wait. There is only 1 McDonald's near the Ferris wheel! The park closes at 6pm so make sure you take the train back from the mountain to the valley around 4pm so you can finish the things at the valley. Must watch: the dolphin show."

Then you ride roller coasters that appear to loop out over the cliffs and you feel like you could zoom out into the water - for the added thrill. There was heavy rock music with Chinese lyrics blasting in the speakers. It was truly an amazing time. Even the escalator system that takes you down to the expanding portions of the park was pretty amazing. The ride back in the underground tram was cool too. Don't forget to visit the aquarium and say hello to the pandas. Overall, it was an excellent day for parents and kids. The lines were a bit long, but it was July and the park staff did the best they could. I would advise taking the tram up the mountain and saving the gondola ride for the way back. We took the express bus from Pacific Place - get there earlier than suggested because the line for the bus was quite long. We were there before opening and the queue to enter was mayhem."

The \"cable car\" was as exciting as ever gives a fabulous view of Hong Kong - though not for weak hearts..!!! The park has some Amazing mix of different types of rides for all groups. I have visited Ocean park few times and have seen great additions every time. The \"Ocean theatre\" is one of my favourite .. Now I know the exact place to sit to get a great view and maximum entertainment.. !!!"

There were a few waiting time and the longest we had to wait was 20 minutes for the gondola.We mainly visited to see the Pandas, luckily we got to see one panda playing around, he was rolling down the hill and was very active, even the staff were amazed in his activity.Some of the exhibits are a bit rundown, but are still enjoyable to see, the Sichuan exhibit was interesting and they had Golden snub nosed monkey, which was active and came close down to the glass for great photo opportunities. The Panda in this exhibit was asleep between a couple of rocks looking down the hill.The gondola ride was impressive and thankfully not too busy, the top area was great and the water ride \"the Rapids\" was just what we needed for the humidity of the day.The Walruses we very active and the cold areas of the Pole areas was a great way to cool down as well as see some wildlife up close.Good value and could easily spend a long day here, food prices were up a bit as per any facility like this, but good options were available."

He loves the trained otter by the panda area and the aquarium of course. The cable car was probably the highlight of this trip. He had so much fun riding it he didn't want to let go of the center pole when we got to the top.

Alight at the front entrance of Ocean Park. Admission ticket at HKD 350.There was long long queue at the cable car station, about 1.5 hour. To cut waiting time, one needs to buy the express ticket at additional HKD 150 which entitled to any 5 rides on the express lane (about 10 minutes queueing time). Purchased the 2 tickets will be HKD 490, really costly; not worth the money.The Seal and Dolphins Show was the most interesting. Need to sit on the amphitheatre (about 45 minutes before show time) early to get better viewing seats. My frank opinion is that the theme parks were flooded with mainland Chinese, adopting push-push, talk aloud, patterns. You can smell them everywhere. I do not enjoy the theme park anymore."

Don't miss the aquarium at the base as it houses sharks also . Take the train while going up and the cable car while coming back from the top Try to do all rides in the south pole area with the hair raise to the most thrilling ride , we did it twice "

The thrill mountain polar express areas didn't open till 11am.3. To get to the top of the mountain and fun stuff in the park you need to take the cable car or ocean express to get there. Cable car takes longer.4. The whirly bird tower thing isn't scary and gives you a good idea of the layout of the park. It's not that straightforward to do.5. Best rides are Hair Raiser, The Dragon, The Abyss, (Mine train was closed). 6. Going mid week (Tuesday) I hit the hair raiser first did it twice without using my fast pass and didn't cue more than 15mins. Using a fast pass you can walk straight onto the platform and skip all the cue. All the rides in the marine world area i walked on to, next in line no cues.7. I'm always a fan of fast passes though I only used it twice, at about 3pm there was a significant cue for the hair raiser and also for the cable cars up and down, was really worth having to avoid these cues.8. The shark thing in marine world is good.9. Longest cue was at McDonalds.10. They are building a MTR station next to it. 11. It's a nice park, very pretty, well maintained and has a good variety of rides, not all for the adrenalin junkie, was a shame that some of the rides wern't working but was still a good way to fill a day. Left at about 3pm doing all the rides i wanted.12. If you go on the rappids ride you will get wet, might be good when its hot but buy a poncho or leave it till last."

It can be a nice day out but in the three times (over 8 years) it doesn't really feel like much, if anything, has changed. That said what I do like about Ocean Park is that it has a bit of everything - some animals, some rides, including water rides (take a coat or poncho if you don't want to get wet!), shows, etc. You can easily spend a whole day there. Definitely recommend you see the dolphin show if you're visiting. Easy to get to on the bus from Admiralty, the bus runs regularly and you can get your entrance ticket along with your bus ticket from the stand at the bus station. Would highly recommend getting your ticket in advance where possible to avoid the queues which can get long on a weekday so dread to think of the queues at the weekend!Take a picnic or have a big breakfast if you want to keep your costs down while you are there. The cheapest place to eat by far is the McDonald's but this is practically deep into the other side of Ocean Park so I imagine by the point a lot of people see it, they have already eaten at one of the park's restaurants or stands."

Ranging river and the Mine Train are kind of hidden so the lines aren't too long, but they are both very fun. The shark exhibit is interesting to explore. This is a great place for very young kids, and also teenagers because there are thrill rides, and more tame ones as well. Part of it is on a mountain, so it does require quite a bit of walking. There are two parts of the park. They are connected by a train and a cable car. I would recommend the cable car, but do it first before the line gets too long."

It was fantastic!!We were met at the entrance by the staff who would be looking after us during our stay. There were 20 people in our group and when everyone had arrived they led us through the entrance and into the Grand Aquarium area. We had a talk in the classroom about the programme and then had dinner in the Neptune Restaurant.Neptune Restaurant is great because it's IN the Grand Aquarium so you can eat your food watching the fish! We had a set menu - I had soup and then chicken and rice. The children had their food served in a train - tomato pasta, chicken nuggets and chips and some vegetables.After dinner we headed out to a private seating area to watch Symbio! Well, it was probably the best theme park show I've ever seen! It was amazing - even if you're not staying overnight I recommend staying to watch Symbio.After the show, the park closes. So we headed back into the Gran Aquarium area and were given a guided tour of the visitor areas, but also the backstage area. Then we went to get our tents and headed back into the Gran Aquarium. We put our tents up and prepared to sleep watching the fish! They provided sleeping bags and pillows although we took some of our own bedding. The room was cold overnight so I would recommend taking extra warm clothes. In the morning we were given a dim sum breakfast at the Panda Cafe and then people that wanted to stay in the park could buy tickets with a 25% discount or if you were leaving you had to go by 10am. It was such a great experience and definitely something different to do in Hong Kong!"

The entire set up of the park is orderly with a clear focus on kids and families. The mix of zoo, aquariums and rides means there is something for everyone. Highlights were the pandas, the Grand Aquarium, the cable car ride and the walruses. We also liked the focus on education and conservation.If you plan to eat in any of the restaurants, go early and put your name down.

I always remembered it when I was little, as a nice amusement park but with way too many people and way too hot. This time I returned as a mother with her own family, in May on a relatively not too hot a day with not too many people and I was amazed! I never knew the park was this huge, it comprises two sides of an entire mountain and is much, much better than Disneyland which stays a formula. Ocean Park is an original Hong Kong concept of its own with a great focus on marine preservation and taking care of our earth and ocean. It's a cross over of an aquarium (largest stingrays I have ever seen), a zoo (panda's!) and an amusement park (great rides). When you come back from the other side of the mountain by cable car (of course), you end up in a replica street of old Hong Kong. It's not such a big deal perhaps but as a Hongkonger, it made be very happy that this amusement park is proud of its heritage. And it should, as it's simply marvellous, for young and old."

There were so many diverse things to do that the 6 pm closing didn't seem to give us enough time at all! Although the entrance fee seemed reasonable for the kids, I found it a bit steep for the adults considering we didn't go on any of the rides and spent the whole time standing around waiting for the kids while they queued for a 2 minute ride. We queued for three quarters of an hour to go down with the cable car and we waited nearly an hour for a taxi to take us home at the taxi rank. Seeing the panda was great and the dolphin show was OK too."

Wow, you first enter on ground level and think that the park is not that big or exciting but once you see the Pandas and other animals it's amazing. Then you head of on an incredible cable car ride to the top of the mountain. The ride probably takes about 15 minutes and the views are breathtaking. Even more astounding once you reach the top there is a huge theme park and lots of aquariums and animals in special habitat exhibits like a huge aquarium, seals, penguins, walruss and more. There is heaps to do for kids and adults alike. There are thrill rides perched on the side of cliffs and there are rides for the little kids plus heaps of animal exhibits unlike anything anywhere else. There is plenty of food to choose from from fast food to bakeries and restaurants. The engineering of how this place was built is just astounding given it's location. Awesome, amazing and incredible."

Q for Cable car to Ocean Park was around 60 minutes and for toddler it won't be advisable. Better you take Ocean Express and Q was very short. The park staff were very rude and did have any kind of courtesy whatsoever. We covered 3 sections, Polar adventure, Rainforest and Marine world. Took cable car as there was no crowd from Marine world. The view from Cable car was excellent and not to be missed. It's good family outgoing."

The rides on top are for kids over 6/7, or taller than 120cm to be precise. There is a play park, and simple rides for smaller kids at the bottom. FYI, it is better to take the train ride up, and cable car back down, as the waiting time to take a cable car up is long, usually 30 mins or more. For smokers, there are designated smoke areas both on top and ground. Didn't visit the aquarium this time as my kid went crazy at the play park. in our opinion, Ocean Park is definitely better than Disneyland and less hectic. Look out for promos if you want to book online. We booked our tickets online thru a local agent called KLOOK, and got the 2 adults 1 free child promo, paid 90usd instead of the normal 124usd. Easy rides from admiralty mtr, bus 629 goes directly to ocean park, same bus back, abt 25 mins each way."

I wasn't disapointed either.Tip: wear comfortable shoes, you will do a lot of walking. Unfortunate for me I was with my three year old son, so I couldn't go on any of the rides. However all the animal enclosures and aquariums were well thought out. The animals all had plenty of room. I was really impressed with the polar exhibition, the walrus and seals had loads of swimming space.We were lucky to get to the sea lions at feeding time. They were fun to watch but disapeared as soon as feeding time was over.I was a bit disapointed with the Australia outback exhibition. My one year old got shushed at by a keeper, as if i had control over his noises. Apart from the koala, the wallaby and kangaroo looked a bit sad. I recommend getting the Ocean Express up to the highlands and the cable car down, the lines aren't as long. We went to one of the restaurants in the park for lunch, Tuxedos. It was fun to have lunch alongside the penguins, and it wasn't too expensive either.It was a bit nostalgic, but also a bit dissapointing to see the kids area really hadn't changed in thirty odd years. Including the concrete play castle. Overall as a family we had a fun day, only marred by some other tourists who pushed our kids out of the way to get on the ideal horse on the carosel. I found it a bit uneasy, lots of tourists were taking pictures (without permission) of my fair haired children. I did find it annoying at the end of every attraction was a shop! But other than that i would recommend coming to Ocean Park."

Saw the seals, penguins, sharks, pandas, birds. All good. Our 10yo had fun and so did we. By 2pm the park was filling up with tour groups but we were ready to go by then. The only cafe we tried was over-priced and the coffee and hot chocolate were terrible."

I traveled with a group consisting of myself and three other people in their twenties and we had a really great time. The rides were a lot of fun, and definitely provided more thrills for an older crowd than HK Disney would have. The lines were reasonable and there were some enjoyable coasters and fast rides. The animal exhibits were also great- the aquarium in particular was stunning and had some really amazing sharks I've never had an opportunity to see in person before. The underwater tunnels are really transporting, and even with the crowds you can still manage to feel like you're alone in a deep, chilling ocean. The staff were quite nice as well- I liked that we were greeted by people willing to take pictures of our group without expecting money in return, and one of the costumed characters got hilariously goofy with us. Food was a bit pricey, but you expect as much in a place like this, so oh well. Worth going for families, especially those with slightly older kids, or just groups of friends."

The transportation is convenient because there is a bus right outside the MTR station which takes to the park. However, the bus drivers can be rude so make sure you have the necessary change for the fare. Also, it can take more time to get to the park if there is traffic on the roads. It was raining to begin with but there are several indoor attractions which can be visited during this time. There is a nice aquarium, pandas, penguins, seals, sharks and a nice dolphin/seals show. Also, do not miss the cable car ride which provides nice scenic views. There is an area called Whiskers harbor for young kids. There were roller coaster/other rides as well for those who enjoy them. Some of the restaurants here are very expensive and do not provide the value for money so do some checking on the same. Suggest downloading their app and showing it while buying the tickets at their counters which gives you a discount. Overall, a fun park with lots to do!"

The staff at the food stalls like literally all of them , yes we went to about 3 different ones were terribly rude.

My honeymoon would have been incomplete without my trip to ocean park. i would advice everyone to pre-book your trip to ocean park as its a little far off from the city. Also reaching there on your own would cost a lot. so its better to arrange a pick and drop facility with the ticket booking. We started our trip by taking the cable car to the upper part of the park as all the major rides are located there and we wanted to avoid the waiting line as well. The cable car ride was great as we got to see a really good view of the ocean. Also i would suggest not to carry a lot of things with you as you ll find it hard to walk with such luggage. Food is not really a problem. They have stalls all around the place. Be prepared to walk as the park is huge and worth your energy. Must visit the place if you are visiting Hongkong."

On the Wednesday we went there were not too many people, so we didn't spend much time queueing for rides.The animals were really interesting, especially the walruses, which I did not expect to see (although I do question whether the facilities were big enough for them, they just seemed to swim around in a kind of bored, monotonous way). The highlight for us was the Australian section, with the small kangaroos and the gorgeous koalas - just hearing the kookaburra was amazing, it was so loud and resonant! Our whole extended family had a brilliant day out at Ocean Park, which we feel is more suitable than Disney now that our kids are bigger - the rides are great, and there's loads to learn.

Ocean Park is a amusement park that is not far from the city, you may be able to ride a public bus to the site (ride is about less than 30minutes).The park opens at 10am, but the zones (Thrill Mountain & Rainforest) only opens at 11am. Even if you go on a weekday, try to go as early as you can to avoid queue. We didnt have to queue up and it was fantastic. My favourite was The Flash & Hair Raiser. Both rides give you a wonderful view of the ocean. Once you entered Ocean Park, you may choose to linger around or go straight to the Summit (two ways- via cable car or express train), we would advise to go for the cable car as you would get an amazing view of the ocean on the way up. There are a few zones, they have zoos, aquariums, overall a really fun place to be. However, rides are more suitable for teenagers- adults. not so much for kids, as they're more of a adrenaline rush.Ps. \"The Dragon\" ride was painful, my head keep on hitting the sides when it turns a corner, really uncomfortable, and i would not recomment riding the \"Eagle\", it's a simple ride, but i got nauseaus on that very badly. The day trip takes about 6~7 hours will do. (if there is not much crowd)"

If you are looking for everything to be shinny, polished, then i think you would be disappointed.This park has been around since my mother was my age (20 something) ! Over the years there has been renovations and new rides added.The park is divided into 2 zones - waterfront and summit, which is connected by cable car or a railway (ocean express), which is about 5 minutes ride. These two areas are not connected by footpath so walking is not an option. The cable car has consistently long queues, especially after lunch hours when tour groups arrive. I did not have an opportunity to take it since the queues are 30min-1 hour.animals: interesting animals such as pandas, koalas, red pandas, a big aquarium, to name some of them. Many are on the waterfront area, though the sharks and performances are at the summit.rides: located mostly on the Summit. Then again there are 2 areas: Marine World, which has all the old-school amusement park rides: viking, ferris wheel, roller coaster, drop tower, swings ; and Thrill Mountain which has the park's fastest roller coaster (Hair Raiser) which has a really awesome view and in my opinion is the best roller coaster in Hong Kong (better than space mountain in disney).

Whiskers harbour is pointless as you have to pay for everything including the kids jumping castle. Needs an upgrade and not a PAYG system The train was good to get you to the top. The cable car was good too but kept stopping. Not good in wind. As for everything else, their were so many tour groups in the park that it made it difficult to get around. Lots of walking up and down hills as well. Food was expensive and average. It was great that our server had such a poor attutide as well. Looked like she was having a real bad day. Lots of rides and some for the thrill seaker so this is a plus but lots of walking around to get to them.Went to a couple of shows. Sea lion and dolphin........ below par. Both went for 15 to 20 mins each and nothing like a sea world performance. Gave up after that.Lots to do but to be honest, i would not make this park a priority on a holiday. Do your own research online to see if you will get what you want from the park before committing. I would also google tickets tickets online as you can get them cheaper than the website/park.I would also recommend getting there near opening so you dont have to queue up too much. We left just after 4pm and the crowds were still coming in from tour groups.From a transport perspective, awesome. Catch the 629 bus from Admiralty MTR station and it takes you to the park. Same bus pick up too. Cost is 10.60 HK each way for adults. Very cheap. 629A from central is also available.I will leave this one up the the individual to decide if the park hits the mark.

Go shopping for souvenirs. You can easily spend a whole day here and be thoroughly entertained. You will enjoy your visit to Ocean Park...its more than just a theme park! I loved it."

Also forked out a little more for the fast pass and totally no regrets.

Advisable to check bus timings for leaving the park, I missed the 629 bus by one minute to star ferry and the next one was only scheduled for half an hour later."

Visited this site to decide and based on availability of animals and journey to reach the place we decided to restrict our visit to Ocean Park and visit Disneyland next time. Fun begins as soon as you enter the park and you encounter really big fountains but we were more interested in Gondola ride that takes visitors from one mountain to another and its breath taking - mountain on one side and sea on another; it can't get better than this. On top of it we were allocated one gondola to ourselves thus doubling the fun. Dolphin show coupled with walrus, shark pond, stingray, jellyfish section, penguin section were amazing for me (these were first for me so please excuse the excitement). :)Some people were comparing it similar parks in other countries but we were too happy to ensure that we cover all animals including big Panda :)Make sure you dedicate an entire day for this park. Due to limited time we didnt try a single ride :( may be next time."

Great viewing opportunities of the animals, we had a super view of one of the pandas. Some of rides have height restrictions that we thought were a little extreme and only our 9 year old was tall enough for a lot of the rides. But there are some rides that the littler ones can go on if accompanied by an adult. It was raining off and on when we went so I think this kept crowd numbers down a little. We also avoided going on the weekend. It was still busy don't get me wrong but wait times were only 10 mins max for rides. Judging by the queuing areas for rides it must get much much busier so we were thankfull for the rain. Everything still ran in the rain. Food and beverages big $$$. We got there via the Ocean Express Bus from Amiralty MTR station. Quick and easy. A must do attraction."

A decade ago there is just the sea animals and some rides. But now so many things to do after its expansion. Now there are land animals, birds and sea animals. There are also different shows here. Love the aquarium, pandas and the sea animal show. There are also specific feeding times where you can see the animals perform while they feed. You should take the cable car or the express train up to the peak first before coming down because tour groups that come after noon time always head to the peak and can be quite crowded there after. 6 hours is not enough for us although we did not take much rides. It is a great place to explore and play for the whole day. Good for children and adults. There are fast food stores and restaurants there so fret not if you feel hungry. For the price, ocean park is worth every single cent compared to disneyland. we went on a day with some drizzle , so at the start it felt like the park is just for us. So fun ."

Tickets bought online with the Ocean Park app provide a 15%. You need to do this at least one day in advance - unfortunately something other reviews here didn't mention. I asked for fastrack to jump the queues (it's not unlimited but can be used once on the major rides), it costs H$150 extra. The ticket seller advised against as it would not be crowded. She was right we saved $600 We took the express train to the top, as recommended by other reviewers, again to beat the crowds. \"Epic fail\" in the words of our teen son as rides didn't open until 11! We hadn't eaten so asked for directions to restaurants that were open. We were sent to many. None open. All open at 11. By now my 6, 9 & 12 year old sons were not happy. It was surprisingly cold up there. Lacking the humidity in the city. Take a jacket!We ate at Tuxedo Restaurant. As it was bang on 11, we got a table by the penguin window. This is very cool. You'd need to book to guarantee this. Tables face a glassed off penguin inclosure! My boys - & I - loved it!! The waitresses were lovely, offering to take photos & generally being very accommodation. The food is not good & massively overpriced. We had 2 cooked frozen pizzas, chicken wings, cheesy fries & soft drinks. The bill was H$950!! Rides great. No queues as promised.The park is massive! Long, windy paths that were confusing to navigate.As it was cold & we were unprepared for this I bought my 6 yr old son a hoodie $450!! Everything super expensive in the park.The pandas were mating so could not be seen, which was disappointing.Best bits were the jellyfish (illuminated in lights to classical music, really cool) l, shark enclosure with giant rays & sawfish. We didn't get to the aquarium.We left as the heavens opened at 2pm to see hundreds & hundreds of mainland Chinese arriving by coaches. Seems we did best the queues after all.We come to Hong Kong regularly. Not sure we'll come back here...."

The park has 2 parts. The Summit & the waterfront. Going up to the summit it is better if you try the cable car which will give you nice view at the top and going back to the waterfront you can also make use of the train so that you can try both. In the summit, they have rides for adults and what I like most was the dolphin show. When you go back to the waterfront it would be best to go inside the giant aquarium, sea lions, penguins, sharks and lots of fish of all kinds. For places like this expect food and drink choices are expensive. But overall my boyfriend and I had fun and if ever we get the chance to visit HK again, we surely come back to Ocean Park, you should not give this place a miss when in Hongkong."

We went to ocean park on a saturday with my wife and my son of 19 years old and were little bit worried about the waiting queue at the different attractions. If you want Its possible to buy the option to skip the queue for 7 attractions ( 150hkd additional per person ) but we didnt .First we arrived at the opening of the park, arround 10am so that there is not yet too much people. In order to do the maximum of attraction before the park become very busy, we decided to ride the ocean express train instead of the cable cable and went directly to the summit where the main attractions are. We started first to ride the attraction there, and there was no waiting queue or maximum 5 minutes so it was great. We have done arround 10 attractions only as some are only for chidrens and we wanted to ride only the ones with sensations. The best ones are the hair raiser, the flash, the mine train , Abyss...We went also to see the show with dolphins and seal at the ocean centre. Its not an incredible show like some aquatic park have but it was nice to see and we can relax a bit after walking and riding the attractions all day.Arround 4pm we decided to go back and took the cable car..it was only the first time we have to wait long..arround 45 minutes..the ocean express was only 10 minutes waiting but we decided to wait for the cable car as we didnt took it in the morning. Then before to leave , we went to the grand aquarium...Honnestly we didnt stayed long time as it is not so \"grand\" and great and it is not quite at all when you have loads of mainland chinese who shout all the time and take pictures with flash all the time in front of the different aquariumIn general we can say that we spent a good day. Maybe we will go back in few years...if they have new attractions"

They issued seasonal tickets by that time and I would like to have a walk in the park with so much to see and so much to play with. Although I had been to Ocean Park for so many times and so many years, I still enjoyed very much every time I went. They offer seasonal themes changing frequently so that you will not got boring with them. Last time, I went with the monks from Tibet. At first, I didn't know they would like to go there as I thought they were usually doing nothing except worshipping Buddha. To my surprise, they enjoyed very much. Actually, Ocean Park is a very good place for many purpose. There is the cable car that my sons used to ride on while they were young. All the animals are lots of fun to children. There are also exciting machines to suits people needs. Besides, the area is so close to the city centre and there will be MTR operating this year with a station at the entrance. Flowers are nice and air is relatively fresh. There is no reason for me not to visit there with my friends from overseas. If you are a tourist and if you like the about reason, I think Ocean Park is a must go in Hong Kong."

Cheapest n convenient way to reach is by MTR. Reach admirality station n take bus 629 after taking exit B.2. Prebook the tkts through klook, it's the cheapest, can opt for family combo @90 USD. Do take the fastpass tkts if going on weekends n holidays, otherwise you will not be able to cover even 40% bcoz of long queues. fastpass has discount coupons as well for food, drinks, souvenirs n make up for half of their cost at least.3. The park has two parts..waterfront n the summit. If your kids are small, I mean less than 5 yrs, opt for waterfront first, otherwise go to summit first as waterfront has activities primarily for very young children.4. Most of the rides for children 6 and above are at the summit.5. Cable car options is far better than express train and if you take cable car, you may even miss ngong ping 360 but for the big Buddha. ( lantau island trip, if planned for another day ).6. McDonald's, KFC, food kiosks, terrace cafe for Indian veg options are all there..Go there in time to enjoy most of the rides as at some places waiting can be upto one hr, however fastpass can help."

The rides are good fun although I chickened out on the hair raiser rollercoaster, the rest of the gang reported it as being short but intense! It's not an enormous park but there is quite a bit of construction so I imagine that it's going to add a lot over the next while. There is also a mtr station being built there which will make it very easy. Right now you get there by bus, which is very east and so well organised, the line seemed so long when the park closed but the organisation was great and there was no shortage of busses to get us home.

Everything was going well until we started to head back and decided to take the Asia express train back down the mountain. The organisation of this queue is poor and sadly the number of tours that are operating meant that very rude tourists were literally queue barging and at one point almost caused a stampede as there are gaps in the queue system where it becomes a free for all. I was with my daughter and wife and were literally shoved out of the way. This I believe is an accident waiting to happen. For this reason I am knocking off 2.5 stars.

The Cable Car ride was long with amazing views best to up grade to FasTrack for 150 HKD to avoided all the long queues. Be aware it only gives you 7 priority accesses so save some for Cable Car. It was ridiculous the line up on Easter Saturday well worth paying the extra to get straight on all the major rides and attractions. The food like most theme parks is expensive and average but we knew it would be. When upgrading to FasTrack you get discount vouchers to use on good, drink and souvenir purchases these came in handy. There are some great roller coasters and other thrill rides. You need a whole day to see the park and lots of energy as it is very spread out. My best suggestion is head straight to the cable car first and do the rides then relax in the afternoon seeing the animals and sea life. We did an organised tour which which we booked the morning of at our hotel the Holiday Inn. It picked us up and dropped us back and we avoided to huge line up to purchase entry tickets once we arrived, well worth it rather than train, bus and queuing for hours. Tour price was 480 HKD for Adult and 320 HKD for Child. Tour company was Grayline."

I have a chance to visit again in March as I celebrate my 60th birthday in HKG this year.Ocean Park offers free entrance to visitor on their birthday. I visited with a friend who's been waited for 5 years to enjoy the privilege. We all paid and that's alright. Just remember they search your bags for food and drinks at the entrance.Some security are less demanding than others. You just need to be smart. Bring empty bottles to get water. Foods inside are very expensive. We fed ourself before we went there.We took a bus at Admiralty station to Ocean Park. The young people like those roller coaster, while I enjoy watching the sea creatures and other animals. They are very educational besides fun. There are machine that for everyone of different ages.The weather was not hot nor cold. Been shower a little. A wonderful day and I ended up paying the balance for close to HK$1000 (US$150) for a year pass as I know I would be back at least a few times a year. I want to go back to try those machines again.It can be very crowded if the weather is good. Tons of visitors from China as its close for them to travel. The big tank I called it deserves the best as its soooo big with 4 storeys high.Bring something for shade as well as to prevent getting wet. Have fun."

Great aquarium displays and the giant pandas were my favourite. Most of the rides are on the top of the mountain, so you need to take the cable car or train up. We took the cable car and the view was fantastic. The most we queued for a ride was 15-20 minutes but we visited the park on a Monday. I advise to get to the park at opening time because if you like rides and want to see all the shows you will need as much time as possible."

The Park is zoned (rainforest, asian animals, polar adventure, whiskers harbor, marine world, etc). The Park mainly has two parts-- the Waterfront and the Summit. It will take you the whole day to enjoy the whole park. It is that big. Start in the morning, as the park opens its doors, and head straight to the Summit because you don't want to go with the conventional crowd who will explore the lower part first. To get to the Summit, you will either ride the cable car or the train. Best to take the cable car on your way up and the train going down so you can experience both. The Summit is where more of the adult and scarier rides are. You can spend half your time here and half your time down the Waterfront (where the giant aquariums are). Food here is very expensive and bringing food from outside is not allowed. To save a bit of money, suit yourself with the food kiosks instead of restaurants."

Plenty of things to keep small children amused and parents enjoying the relaxed atmosphere of the park.The cable car to the summit provided a good view back across the bay to Kowloon and more wonderful views at the top. The cable car provides access to more activities and the highlight is the Ocean Park Tower, providing extraordinary views of the South China Sea, from 70+metres up in a gently rotating, seated viewing room that provides 360 degrees of sweeping views.Plenty of eating establishments, one area being Old Hong Kong.

OK let me preface this by saying that both Hong Kong Disney and Ocean Park need to be seen , Before I went to either of them I believe that one would be better than the other one would be more necessary than the other that proved to be not true. GETTING THERE: We took the subway then us not far not too hard at all and the person selling the tickets was very courteous and give us great information about the bus there was also a little water vendor who had a sign water here 10 dollars water Ocean Park $25 so it gave me the incentive to buy outside the park, the bus was around 30$hkd ride to Ocean Park was very beautiful and scenic I enjoyed it a lot,ARRIVAL: Upon arrival to Ocean Park there's a very old-fashioned steam punk train that takes you to the main area , TICKET GATE: The ticket area was also very convenient to get online and recently showed the online code and the security seemed very well they stopped some Indians from doing something and they thoroughly examine the bags , I gave my famous I don't have a gun line and was able to not go through security , ENTERING THE PARK: there was a love fountain and it's to view there was a panda VW car which looked really cool , CLEANLINESS: Ocean Parkway is also very clean and we didn't see Ocean Parkway is also very clean and we didn't see a lot of workers many workers cleaning, so that's goodPANDAS!!!!/zoo / aquarium : what really separates this place from Disney is the fact that they have a zoo with a lot of these and animals not a lot but these monkeys 2 what really separates this place from Disney is the fact that they have a zoo, monkeys, 2-4 pandas, for you animal activists the animal were very clean and seems mentally healthy, The aquarium was also very nice it was nice and chilly inside so it was a nice break from the summer weather weather and they had a lot of seals and walruses they also had many stingrays sharks fish . Hammer head sharks, we could touch the shovel crab, and this was no extra charge this was all included the original ticket price BATHROOMS: I don't remember so therefore wasn't spectacular or badPUBLIC WATER: I forgetRESTAURANTS: we weren't very hungry so we only had to McDonald's remember we both adequately ate for 100hkdRIDES: The rides were pretty good there a little bit larger than Disney then there's also a cable car that takes you to another area of the park , THE LINES: I don't recall them being grandCOMFORTABLITY: like I said the park is a bit more of a hike in Disney and if you're for you enjoy just sweating and definitely give you a good workout they were in abundance of seats and like I said if you were hot you can go look at the marine animals again , THE SCENERY: what really made this park special for me was the rides were good and they were also very well situated with the natural beauty of Hong Kong so while I'm upside down on a ride I'm looking at beautiful islands beautiful oceans ,VALUE FOR MONEY: I feel so the value for the money was very good it was $270 , it was beautiful for the hiking the rides were good , The animals were very special aquarium was very nice ,So all in all I believe this park is also with visiting but I put Disney a little bit better if you were into the Disney universe if you just want to go hiking and bigger rides go to Ocean Park but both are equally valid and one does not substitute over the other thank you for reading this and if you have any questions please feel free to so all in all I believe this park is also with visiting but I put Disney a little bit better if you were into the Disney universe if you just want to go hiking into bigger rides go to Goshen Park for both are equally valid and one does not substitute over the other thank you for reading this and if you have any questions please feel free to contact me"

Unlike Disneyland or other major themed parks, you will not get the dreamlike atmosphere at Ocean Park. Instead you will rewarded with a much more relaxed experience which you don't feel the need to rush and queue for popular rides/shows. Perhaps this is because I was visiting it on a weekday but I definitely enjoyed the visit more. The cons are the inaccessibility (no MTR but one is opening soon), expensive food (like most theme parks). The show (dolphin and seal show) also seems to be not as interesting as before. Another thing which is almost nondescript of most HK services is the attitude of the staffs at the park. You can hardly feel that you are welcomed at all."

With an area of 170 acres, it's one of the largest ocean theme park in the world. The park was opened in 1977 (over 30 years) and still attracted many visitors each year with its continuing effort in the development and improvement of the park. It has various attractions and rides, including roller coasters, animal exhibits with different themes, such as a giant panda habitat, rainforest and polar displays, as well as an aquarium featuring one of the world's largest aquarium dome. There are 2 major attraction areas (Waterfront & Summit) and they are connected by 1.5km long cable car (with great view) or Ocean Express Train. We visited Ocean Park almost each year and enjoyed each visit. There are really lots of things to see and do for the whole family (young & old). The only complaint is that the food is very expensive and bringing food is not allowed (like many theme parks around the world) as security guards will check your bags. Also, you might encounter some of the uncivilized Mainland Chinese (if you are unfortunate) do not line up and jump the queue. Other than that, it is a pleasure and rewarding experience with satisfying good memories."

Loved all animal areas. I arrived around 10.30 on the bus from central, ride only took about 20 minutes. Wasn't too busy at this time. I went up to the bit where the rides are on the train and came back via cable car. As I was traveling on my own I was apprehensive about going on the rides on my own but once you looks around you'll notice plenty of people are in same boat so you just have to do what you want and get on the rides. I thoroughly enjoyed the day out."

Its better than singapore underwater. Manta and sharks also stay in an 60 cm width of glass giant aquarium. Jelly fish, lion fish and thousand of wild species completed this ocean park. Coming here for 1 day felt not enough to explore the whole park. Inside here also a cable car station connect one site to another. Cause i gonna went back to singapore, i should leave in a hurry. A little disappointed , but time up what can i say. Ocean park hongkong is great , nobody says no . Proud for ocean park. Hope one day i will come back. Will u?"

And a very good tip: buy ur ticket at 7 eleven, try the student discount which will cost half the price(193,00HKs).If u want to see the panda, go early in the morning when he is not sleeping.

This will help you save a lot of money instead of spending money for expensive lunch in park- After get into the park, pick the map and rush to the cable car to go to The Submit (most of attractions in here) then back to Water Front by Ocean Express"

For those who would like some adventure and a good view, you may ride the cable car going to the peak (longer queuing), it will take you about 10 mins.

If you do want to spend you day on the rides, then I suggest buying the express pass to jump the queue - we waited more than 45 minutes for one ride and judging by the queue bollards and ropes, that wasn't as busy as it could be! The animal displays are great, far better than many zoos in the world that we have been to. The pandas and red pandas were a hit with our kids.The cable car is worth the wait. It takes you from the main area up and over a couple of mountains and concludes atop a mountain where there are some great rides."

Bought tkts in advance from a 7 Eleven store. Cheaper online but our credit card wouldn't work. Park not busy on a Saturday, we thought there would be long queues. Disney/Universal it is not. Very spread out with lots of walking. The two areas are connected by either a train or cable car. You cannot walk between them so if it was busy I would imagine long waits in the sun. The rides are nothing special but it was nice to see the animals (pandas, seals, penguins, fish). The ocean show with divers and sea lions was awful- we left half way through. The park is more suitable for small kids or for someone who hasn't experienced the USA theme parks. We left after 3 hours and caught a taxi to Stanley to get some lunch. Made a change after the noise and crowds of HK city. Lots of walking up and down hills/paths, you have to retrace your steps to catch the cable car or train to get to the exit. Hard going for the elderly or those pushing buggies."

Another house with five pandas. another with many different animals, insects and reptiles all well done and very environmentally friendly. Many rides and attractions including a cable car ride across a mountain to another part of the park. It is free if you are a senior citizen (70) and also free on your birthday. This has to be on your bucket list especially if you have children. A very full day."

I read a really good article before I went which gave me some advice on how to plan my way round the park and it worked. So I ordered tickets on line and got a 20% discount, it was about \u00a360 for two. Then we got the bus there for about 80p. Brilliant. Upon arriving we took the cable cars and took full advantage of the rides without the need to queue. The view from the cable car is ace, I spent the whole time wondering how they managed to build all of that on a mountain. The ride selection was good and I really enjoyed everything the park had to offer. The Hair Raiser and The Dragon were my favourite rides. I am a huge animal lover, so to be abel to spend my time between roller coasters and animals was the best thing ever. I was a bit disappointed when there were loads of polar bear statutes outside of the Arctic building and then there were no polar bears. But to be fair, that's probably me being a bit dim, China doesn't really cater for that climate. The food at the park is unusual. Many people were eating this paper thin flat grilled squid which smelt a bit like popcorn and fish. I opted for a hot dog, I wish I'd had the popcorn squid. But, that didn't ruin the day as there is plenty of choice, we just found it too late. The park is definitely loved by the people of HK and there weren't a great deal of tourists there (we did go in low season on a Wednesday - I don't anticipate it's always so quiet), despite that, the majority of staff spoke English and if they didn't I used the international language of pointing. The ultimate highlight for me was to see the pandas. OMG. They are docile fluffy magical beasts. I was so overwhelmed I wanted to cry. One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. I loved how tranquil there environment was, one was tumbling around being adorable. And the other was just napping outstretched by Superman. Best. Thing. Ever. Well worth a visit and an experience that will stick with me forever. I just loved it. Perfect for all ages, with something for everyone. "

It is definitely no sea world. From entering the park I first notice how old fashioned the ticketing is compared to HK Disney, old fashioned tickets of course don't affect your visit. Shows like the sea Lion and Dolphin show were short and uneventful, but still more than enough to mesmerize our two year old. If you have not visited Ocean Park before, and I am guessing the fact that you are reading this means you have not, then it is a mixture of a traditional theme park along with something of a Zoo. The rides are older but never the less can be quite thrilling. The animals a fair mix of cuteness and interest. the Cable car ride in particular is quite long and interesting, particularly on an increasingly rare clear day in Hong Kong. The Panda's which are quite rare in other zoo's around the world can be worth a trip in themselves, and usually you can spot at least one of these illusive creatures. As we live in Hong Kong with young Children we have purchased an annual pass as the Children love the trip. As long as you don't expect anything like Sea World in the USA then you should have a good day. There is certainly enough to do for a whole day."

Anyway, there is more to see and we ended up spending 6.5 hours here. The journey on the citybus 629 from Admiralty took 10 minutes. Set off early as there are crowds. Buy return tickets for the bus. You will need to get the train through the mountain up to the Aquarium and also the rides are up at the top of the mountain. The aquarium is extremely well thought out as you meander down in the darkness which simulates the sea. The penguins are great but the dolphins are the attraction here. They come up to you in the breeding centre but the show is amazing. They have more than enough space to swim around and clearly have a rapport with their keepers. Show is free but you have to go early to get a seat. Show as at 2pm. We came down on the cable car. Queues appear at various times throughout the park but we only had to wait 15 minutes which was spent shuffling along the route with others to the cable car. If you like heights it is a spectacular view, but if you don't, just don't look down. You either have to get the train or the cable car as this part of the park is over the mountain. The Australian Kingdom was interesting with the Koala and wallabies but they are in a cramped environment. The food choices weren't great and they weren't allowing people to take food in. Water was ok but food was confiscated. Our feet were hurting when we finished but again, another trip to the pandas reminded us why we had come. Would definitely go again."

Not necessarily because I wanted to, but my business associate LOVES roller coaster rides and amusement parks. We're both from the San Francisco Bay Area of central California. I grew up near the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, so I've had my fill of rides. My associate will travel throughout the western USA to ride different roller coasters as a hobby. We were 1st in line that Saturday morning in mid January 2016. Weather was pleasant, about 70 deg F that day with almost no wind. We headed to the aquarium first to see the manta rays and sharks. Large tanks, interesting constantly lowering walkways as you circle the tanks. Good views. This aquarium is worth the price of admission. This, and the tram ride to the roller coaster area of Ocean Park. Loved that ride the best. Fantastic views. I could ride that one ride for hours. My associate enjoyed two of the coasters, but the other was under repair. Much of the area was under repair in the winter. But that was ok, because we were there for the rides and the aquarium. While I took over 10 years to finally get to Ocean Park, I can say that I'd probably not go back. I think this is a perfect place for school children to see the aquarium, and local teens to enjoy a ride on a roller coaster with great views. Other than that, with so much more sightseeing to do in the HK area, I'll be happy with one visit only. Thanks, Ocean Park, for a really good day!"

Both are very interesting rides. The place is really big and will take one full day to see all rides, all shows and enjoy the rides.

It's an amazing experience to be on the inside of such an exhibit looking out. The aquatic life is used to humans and so don't behave in an intimidating way.

Very easy to reach Ocean Park, we stayed on Kowloon and walked 5 mins from our hotel (Intercontinental Grand Stanford, Mody Road Kowloon) to the bus station and took a lovely clean air conditioned double decker bus (run approx every 15 mins) cost about \u00a31.30 one way The journey took us through the tunnel from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island and the journey time was about one hour. Many stops (about 20 )along the way but we were sitting on the top deck in the front seats and great view along the way!I visited Ocean Park in 1986 and was advised nothing much had changed. It was approx \u00a338 entrance fee and divided into different sections- similar to Disney. The cable car takes you up high along the side of the mountain/cliffs to the higher section where there were many rides built into the side of the mountain and huge outdoor escalators to access the different levels so suitable for everyone as not too many steps.Chinese tourists seem to love roller coasters and scary rides as there were plenty of those. Saw the dolphin show but if I'm perfectly honest I really think dolphins should not be in an aquarium half way up a mountain but in their natural habitat. You could count the western tourists on one hand we were very much a minority but no one bothered us and everyone very friendly. Food in the park aimed at the Chinese market- one particular thing I noticed was 'Korean Squid' flattened squid in a plastic packet which looked revolting! So always have something to eat before you go as nothing particularly appetising !! We found a 'bakery' but only thing we fancied was a custard bun with a luke warm coffee !2 buns and one small latte \u00a39! We saw a real Panda as they have a conservation programme with I hope the Pandas being released back into the wild.We enjoyed feeding the sea lions and seeing the penguins but again they were half way up a mountain and although well cared for- not in their natural habitatWe came down from the mountain on the Polar Express which was about a 10 minute journey. This was a tram/ train and an alternative to the 25 min Cable Car journey if you are not good with heights! It's a fun park mainly I suppose aimed at children but enjoyable to walk around and take in the atmosphere."

Perhaps admittedly it is my Western theme park experience growing up, but Ocean Park has the feel of an '80s theme park, albeit with a fresh coat of paint. As expected, the themes of the rides and attractions are Asian, based on cartoon animal characters. For those not really into rides, there are enough live animal attractions to keep you busy for several hours. The crowds were very light on the day we visited (a Tuesday) and we often felt like we had the place to ourselves. The preservation and Save-the-animals sentiment being offered doesn't often seem to quite fit with the fake conditions under which some of the animals are housed. But in many cases, the up close experiences are well done (most noteably the penguin exhibit). Food is expensive, but that's now the norm in all theme parks where they have you at the disadvantage of having no other option."

Decided it was time to intro him to roller coaster rides. So when we landed at HK Airport, we straight to the CTS counter outside the arrival hall and bought tixs to Ocean Park, and HK Disneyland. Tixs was priced based on the dates we wanted to visit.Tixs for OceanPark was greatly discounted. We found out why when we visited OP the next day. The main animal show was closed, and so was the GrandAquarium. Next time, we must check the show availability before we buy tixs.There was already a small crowd at OP when we arrived opening time. Probably because it was a Sunday. Fortunately, we did not have to wait more than 30mins for the rides we selected.Went straight to the MineTrain ride, and then the Raging River ride. There was no waiting time for either. The 6yr old just reached the 122cm minimum height requirement. We worked with the friendly ride attendant to build up the courage of the 6yr old. After this 2 ride, the rest of the qualifying rides was a cinch. He even rode the EagleRide twice.The longest line we waited was the bumper car. it was a 45min wait even though the line said 30min. we also queued 30mins to ride the carousel.Wait time for the FerrisWheel was 45mins. probaby because it was lunch time and the attraction was near the food places. So we skip this ride.Most dissapointing ride was the OceanExpress ride. it was less exciting than a MTR ride.Closing show Symbio was the star for us. Definitely worth the wait. There are more attractions that can be covered in a single day. We will come back for another visit."

For example the hair raiser is a very scary ride and it is more suitable for grown ups, but there is also an underwater train that kids could enjoy. Shows are also available at Ocean Park. For example the dolphin show.  The Ocean Park food isn\u2019t that good and it is also expensive. People are also very crowded while you are purchasing the food. The line of the food and restaurant are so long same as the roller coaster line. I would like to recommend you to go during winter season. During the summer seasons you would be very hot because most rides are outdoor and you could get sun burn. If you go during the winter season while you are on the ride you would be very hot.  Overall, Ocean Park is a wonderful place to visit because of the rides and the show that are amazing. P.S. I would recommend you to spend 2 days at the Ocean Park because 1 day isn\u2019t enough!"

From its old catchy theme song \"it's hip it's fun, it's ocean park\" to the multi level areas accessible by trains or cable car or escalators. As a HK resident, you can get in free when you are over 65, or on your birthday. And their annual pass is a great value, which you will have paid off if you go more than 3 times a year.The staff are friendly and helpful and even during crowded days (sundays and public holidays) thinks keep moving.It has something for everyone, aquariums, rides, playgrounds and amazing views.However the downside: there is a security check at the beginning of the entrance. You need to open your bags. They aren't looking for weapons or publications of ill-repute, they are looking for food. You are not allowed to bring in your own food into the park. This would be ok if the food inside the park was any good. But it isn't. It is atrocious at worst and not worth the money at best. We went to all the food outlets over the years and the quality is going down progressively. And the cost? HK$ 40 for a tiny hot dog that in my opinion contained more fillers than meat. That's just one example. The park is still worth a visit, just eat before you go, and don't dare to bring your own food, lest you want the sandwich patrol to confiscate it."

It's a good mixture of rides, shows, exhibits and a place to run around.If you go during summer, I now understand why Asians carry an umbrella around cause the sun does burn even with 50+ sunscreen. Compared to overseas the food isn't too over priced. We luckily went on a slightly rainy day which didn't bother us but the crowds were not as bad.It's true what they say about mainland chinese tourists unfortunately about barging in and always rushing, I got shoved back into the toilet stall cause the lady was in such a rush! But a sharp word and they seem to wake from their daze, I think they are just so used to crowds pushing and shoving is the only way to survive and they genuinely don't realise they are being rude. So I just learn to expect it and take it down as a cultural experience and instead try to appreciate their excitement instead.Great place that symbolises HK to me and of course the young kids love it."

Nothing on the menu was edible. Take your own food, as you would expect food is pricey at locations such as ocean Park but it was all terrible.

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and felt like kids ourselves. Some of the highlights were the roller-coaster, the cable car ride between two sections, the dolphin show, the aquarium exhibit and the restaurant overlooking the gorgeous water. It was December and busy but we never waited as long as the sign indicated. There is just so much to see and explore with the theme park and animals all just as exciting. What a lovely day we had. We even saw giant pandas. I would definitely recommend you going here if you are in Hong Kong for a few days. The entrance fee is quite steep but well worth it!"

I like roller coasters, and theirs were kind of average (uncomfortably bumpy and shaky - one of them my head spent the whole time uncontrollably banging between the sides of my harness, to the point where I felt quite ill coming off), but they were okay and there was so much else to see. We wandered down to a section of the park we didn't realise was closed, and while we couldn't access that, we ended up outside the vet centre for all the animals. While I can't imagine many visitors would seek this out - you should! They have a room that you can walk into that has 5 swimming pools with dolphins in, swimming and training and playing around. We stayed for about half an hour or more just watching the dolphins, and most of the time were the only people there. The park was also just really well put together and interesting to move around, and the exhibits were amazing. Very immersive and interactive.

The temperature went down to up to 10 degrees so it was really cold that day.It was a great experience in the sense that we can have fun taking rides at the park and at the same time being environment conscious as you get to learn about the animals inside the park as well.There was not much queue on the rides probably because it was a rainy Monday and many people may have opted to stay indoors or go some place else but it was an advantage on our part as we do not have to wait long time for any ride.The rides in Ocean Park is more extreme than Disneyland but nevertheless exciting.I am a bit scared of heights but was able to overcome it 2x when I rode Ocean Park Tower, a tower with a rotating view deck where you can have a 360 degrees view of Hong Kong and also taking the cable car on the way down. It was one of the most exciting (not to mention terrifying) 15 minutes of my life. Thank God I made it down alive! Ha ha ha!And I wanna try it again.They sell very nice souvenirs which are not very expensive.Ocean Park is definitely worth a visit. It is very accessible too. From MTR Admiralty station, take the shuttle bus 629 that goes to Ocean Park directly same thing on the way back."

It was very well organized and people are actually respecting the rules (well, most of them ;))We really enjoyed walking around there and especially see real pandas! And this on different places. That would have already made our day, but then, they have this Australia place with Koalas and kangaroos, in the Polar Adventure you can see penguins and there are lot of things to do.If you like it, there are some roller coasters, but as they line was very long, we decided not to go on a ride. Instead we went to the aquarium and all other places to see more animals (seals etc).A small tip: We used the Ocean Express to get to the summit. Lining up for the cable car to go up was like a 45 mins wait, while the Ocean Express was there without a line. We then took the Cable car to get back down, when the line was not long. Somehow, the line at the bottom was all the time long. At least, we had a chance to use the cable car and didn't have to wait long.The day was one of the highlights we had during our stay in Hong Kong."

The important part is to manage your expectations - I see this place more like a zoo & interesting attractions, but not much for rides. (The rides are average overall) The cable car is an iconic experience - but if you're at the park early and there's a long line waiting for it, it might be a better strategy to take the ocean train up first and to take the cable car down in the afternoon. They have a good range of animals from red pandas to arctic foxes - and has two impressive aquariums with a variety of specimens. One good thing to remember: buy water before you get there. It's expensive!"

However, after visiting Similair parks in Thailand and Malaysia and singapore, we found Ocean park lacking in many ways. The rides are mostly for big children and the sea life that they have on display is not very impressive. There weren't many shows on and the fountain show in the evening is just about average compared to the one in Sentosa island in singapore or even the fireworks at Universal studios. The Park is divided in 2 parts and the one on top of the mountain also does not offer much in terms of variety. You have to spend almost half hour in line to catch a ride which lasts for maybe 10 minutes. Not worth the ride and the money."

At every ride you may have to wait 30-40 mins. Be prepared for that The rides are awesome, more thrilling than Disney world so don't give this place a miss. What I liked best (& its my personal opinion) were the exhibits, there is never much crowd over there, within 10-15 mins of waiting time you can easily enter, It was the first time I saw so many things up & close & it was beautiful. Imagine watching a toucan less than 1 metre away & noticing it has blue eyes!!! Tips if u have kids 1) rent the stroller even if u have to pay 100HKD. After 3 hrs he/she is going to be dead tired. My hubby had to carry my son on his shoulders most of the time. 2) most of the souvenirs r over priced but less than what they sell in Disney world. So take extra cash 3) Food everywhere is 30% higher rate so, again, take extra cash Tickets: we booked from klook.com & no, its not fake...we got discount, entry was super quick how to reach : . if ur hotel is near any metro station, use the mtr home website to find the metro line route.Ocean park is a bit expensive but worth every HKD provided u go on weekday & go early...Have fun"

            "review": "Great Fun-filled place. The Ocean park is an amazing place for kids and adults alike to have a fun-filled day out! Went there 2 weeks back and had a lot of fun.Some of the rides look really scary but are not to be missed! If one has to choose between HK Disneyland and Ocean park purely in terms of fun, in my opinion the Ocean park wins over it's more famous counterpart.Some tips and information (the promotions in points 7 and 8 may no longer be valid):1. Try to reach at the opening time itself, as experiencing all attractions would easily take the whole day long.2. Do not spend too much time at the aquarium and other attractions near the entrance first. Maybe 15-20 minutes3. There will definitely be much lesser crowds during weekdays (Tue-Thu), so if possible should plan on going there on these days4. All rides stop at 6 PM5. One should definitely experience the cable car ride back from the summit to the base. It would easily qualify as one of the scary rides of the park :-)6. Carry raincoats or ponchos with you, both to protect against intermittent rainfall and also for the water ride7. For Krisflyer members - there was a 12% discount on the entry tickets (for upto 4 tickets per krisflyer member) - so carry your krisflyer card or atleast have an image of it in your phone8. For ppl who have arrived from Singapore to HK via TigerAir, there was a 10% discount on the entrance tickets upon presenting the boarding pass (for upto 4 tickets per boarding pass)"

To make it simple, we took a taxi from the city and the ride takes about 30 minutes.There are 2 levels - Waterfront and Summit - the upper one reached with a cable car/train. Overall the options for young kids are minimum. Our son who was 3 years old that time couldn't enjoy to his heart's content (he did so in Disneyland).There are some interesting rides for older kids in the Summit. The cable car ride to the summit in itself is interesting!Overall, good to spend a day with older kids. If you have younger kids and choosing between OP & Disneyland - go for the latter."

The queuing time was not fast because they took so long to empty and refill the rides. Don't waste your money, this is not a good day out for westerners."

Ocean Park is all in one: Zoo, North and South Pole animal environment, underwater world aquariums, shark and string ray tanks, dolphin basins, scenic cable car ride and thrilling rides on roller coasters.With such a conception, it is far more interesting than Disneyland for the whole family. You'll need an entire day.FIRST ADVICE: Buy your tickets online at Klook.com It will save you 15-20% on the regular prices, plus you skip the lines and go directly to the entrance gates.ACCESS: If in party of 3 or 4, don't bother with the 629 bus. Take a taxi and for around 50 HKD you're at the entrance gate. VISIT PLAN: Be there 10 min before opening times and take the cable car to the second station (there are only two stations, start and end). Now, you're in the ride attractions area. Take the roller coasters first, before the big queues form. Best coaster is the Hair raiser. Apart from the rides in this section, not to be missed is the shark tank and Polar stations. Watch for the feeding times to be there. On the way back you can take the cable car again or the Polar express train. In the first part (which you missed when entering) most interesting are the pandas (watch for feeding time also). Apart from that, in that part is a big aquarium (nothing special) and rides for the youngest ones.NOTE: The park is huge, spread on 2, 3 hills. You'll need a lot of walking, uphill and downhill. For elderly, wheelchair and strollers can be very demanding.FOOD: Expensive and low quality. McDonalds is most reasonable with prices (it's by the shark tank)."

The hairraiser was great, the dragon seemed as it was 12 years ago. The aquatic exhibits are magnificent and worth the visit even just fm for themselves. It's a lot more walking than I remember, wear good walking shoes. I suggest coming early via the Admiralty or Central bus that goes directly to the park. (Don't worry there are signs inside the Mtr station that says to Ocean Park buses). Once at the park, take the express train up and ride the thrill rides before lunch to avoid the crowds. Take the cable car down, and spend the afternoon on the aquatic and panda displays. We ended at the grand aquarium and thought we had a perfect itinerary. All in all, a great way to spend a day in HK."

While Ocean Park has seen significant expansion over the years and the addition of some quality attractions, this park remains mediocre when it comes to theming or basic maintenance. Toilets are filthy and smelly and the same can be said for the street-side food. Never in my life have I endured such smelly fried squid! There's also littering everywhere and the ride buildings and vehicles are showing their age and consequent decay. Yes it is great for Ocean Park management to keep competing with Hong Kong Disneyland and boosting their attraction number but at the end of the day, quality is far more important than quantity and no amount of attractions will make this park any cleaner. The layout and geography of the park isn't very well thought out either. An example would be a lack of benches and a profound lack of shade under the biting Hong Kong sun. My suggestion? Skip this one if you can."

We visited Ocean Park on a weekday with 2 elderly and 1 toddler in tow.The rides in the park is very much enjoyable, good thing is there isn't much queue for most of the rides which means we get to ride as much as we can. Paid games here is also very worth it, managed to won 2 soft toy for my son. There are photo taking BEFORE the rides, which i find it to be interesting as most theme park i went took the photos in the mid of the ride, but this also means you can pose nicely for the camera (Which kind of defeat the purpose of an impromptu shot?). They print out the photos irregardless if you want to buy it or not, which i think is quite wasteful. One thing to note thou, the way the park operates I feel is not very organized. Many time, at the ride queue, they could have prepared for the next batch to queue at the 'gate' area of the ride before the ride arrived to save on time, which unfortunately was not done. They have to wait for the people on the ride to disembarked fully, then get the next batch to queue at the gate. Time is wasted there. The pandas enclosure is a big plus to the park, especially love the red panda feeding time, where the trainers will ask the red pandas to pose for the camera, super cute!! The dolphin show was closed when we was there (And was told by their staffs that it's been closed for almost a month now, which is a big disappointment to the elderly as that was one of the only attraction they could enjoy but it was not available)Love the sea life carousel as well, as they have 'Double' seat for parents with young children to sit together.The tram ride up is also very interesting, and love that they have special lane for the wheelchairs and strollers."

The new aquarium is bigger and has better viewing windows but I still like the old one more(nostalgic reason). As a diver and a marine animal lover I made my stop every time. I also think it is one of the best aquariums in the world in terms of species variety and scale and information after being in many aquariums around the world. They also added a train as an option besides cable car to commute between the upper and lower park. Cable car has better view but the train usually has a shorter queue. It was also my first time to visit the glacier area for the new roller coaster and see snow foxes and penguins. Only complain is the queue was 45mins for the roller coaster. The Halloween event had been a big success every year and they also improve a lot compared with my visit few years ago. The queue was not as bad as I imagined. I queued up from 0-30 mins for each haunted house. The haunted houses are all very well prepared in details and the actors are all very well dressed and passionate in their roles. The haunted house that only allow you to go one by one was such a surprise. It was very creative. I think it was so much above my expectation for the tickets price I paid.

I though the cable car ride was great. You can see the bay and the view was really great!A little note about food, find a table first if you dont want to stand around with a tray full of food on your hands trying to look for table, because you wont be able to maneuver as fast, And don't eat the ramen, it was barely palatable... stick with fried stuff.We didn't take any rides as we have young children with us. We went to the arctic area which reminds me of a scene in happy feet. It nice and cool in there with a strong fish smell :) There was penguins, walruses, sea lions and seals. Lots of information about the animals for the kids that are not too excited. THen the big shark tanks was pretty good too.We went to a dolphin show, but it was a bit disappointing... i know there isnt too much that we can do with them, but it feels like wherever we go its the same show..I think if there are nothing new, once is more than enough to come here.PS: its super busy at all the attractions.."

We arrived before lunch and headed straight for the cable car (no queue). Amazing view. Getting off, it was virtually empty with no queues for anything so we just went for it. The roller-coasters were great. Amazing scene of turning upside-down over cliffs and the beautiful seas. it was magic.The rest of it was fine for our small children. Lots to see for all ages, lots of animals etc.Then came lunchtime. Lots of choices. Importantly unlike many rip off theme parks around the world McDonald's is as cheap there as anywhere in Hong Kong, $20 (\u00a32 or $2 US) for a Big Mac. Then came the crowds - they have obviously slowly worked their way slowly to our end of the theme park. There are a lot of people from middle of the afternoon. However by that time we had done our bit with the rides very satisfied and spent the rest of the day enjoying the static attractions.Moral of the story - arrive early, head straight for the cable car, then do your rides, then relax"

There's a nice aquarium near the entrance which is fully air conditioned so it's nice and cool browse the various sea animals (really nice especially on a hot humid day). There's an area called \"old Hong Kong\" which is a must see. it features a typical Hong Kong street back in the 50s that we often see in Asian movies such as Ip Man. the food are authentic Hong Kong Hawkers' food. Really Yummy. Try the egg waffles, curry fishballs & steamed rice noodle rolls.Old Hong Kong is right next to the cable car which is an all time favourite so there's usually a 45 min wait to go on but it's worth the wait. If you don't have the patience there's a express train that takes you up to the area where the rides are. There are enough variety of rides for young child, teenagers and adults. Don't forget to wait for the water show at around 6.30pm before leaving. In our opinion, the Ocean Park has been better maintained than Disneyland in Hong Kong. You can easily spend a whole day there."

Very large theme park incorporating live animal exhibits with theme park rides. tere are 2 parts to the park. A large section as you enter where you van view pandas and sealife. Take the cable car to the other side of the island for some pretty exciting roller coasters.Very busy on weekends but it's so large it's easy to get around."

Having enjoyed Seaworld on the Australian Gold Coast and USA San Diego, I was looking forward to this park/aquarium experience. It was a quiet day but still plenty of crowds, but this park laid out over 2 main areas separated by a cable car ride meant we didn't have to wait long on too many attractions.This is more of an amusement park with an ocean theme although the Marine Mammal Rehab & Hospital was an interesting yet slightly hidden opportunity to see behind the scenes.The Great Aquarium was fascinating and a wonderful sight of many different species.The Walrus was a sight to behold but his repetitive swimming behaviour (sterotypy) suggested a lack of environmental stimulation and a concern for emotional welfare.The standout feature was not a fish or marine mammal but the pandas, both Red and Giant. Could have sat there for hours & watched them interacting in the well planned environment.Food was standard amusement park fare with both Chinese & Western influences.A very tiring day well enjoyed, with some caveats."

Its like a combination of SeaWorld and a fun park. Though we didn't have much time to spend there we still enjoyed ourselves. It gets quite crowded with mainland China folks so the trick is to head to the Summit first and have lunch before trying out the rides. Then go down to enjoy the animals and games. Try out 'The Terrace Cafe' up there - food's not too bad and it gives you a beautiful view of South China Sea."

Ocean Park only has one family shared toilet which is far away from the water area on the other side of the park. I suggest keeping a close eye on your children, whilst playing and not letting them enter the toilets alone, even if they are older like my son. The person who assaulted my son was a holder of a disabilities card which allows free entry to those with both mental and physical disabilities. I was offered a free day after the incident, but I will never be returning and my son still has nightmares. Watch your kids at all times, this is a busy place I would hate for it to someone else."

The ride is for 20 minutes and goes right to the door. The first glance of the park takes one to a whole different level. The cable cars going to the top of the mountain, big fountains etc makes one go gaga over the place. Anyway if one likes rides/roller coasters he should head directly to the cable car. The roller coasters here can really pump up the adrenaline . Moreover one can see sharks, fishes, penguins, 30 degree view of the park and south china sea from that area, before heading in the ocean express back to see the rest of the park. The ocean express was a bit of disappointment as it is only a mode of travel and does not go deep in water as w thought though it was made almost like Captain Nemo's \"Nautilius\".A must visit if you have young children with you like i did."

So plan accordingly. If you want to take your time and visit all parts of the park, you may need 2 days, possibly. It is unbelievably huge~The rides are incredibly exciting too!

We read most signs. We saw the animals being very active and learned so much about them. This time we're traveling with a toddler, and it was a totally different visit, not as fun as the first time. We still saw the same animals but didn't try to follow any schedule. As a result, the animals were sleeping or hiding, hence not as interesting for a little one. The big fish tank, shark tank, jelly fish tank were his favourite but was lost interest very quickly. So we were constantly moving, not staying in one spot marvelling at sea horses or sturgeons. We didn't do the rides except the cable car that offers beautiful view. The long queue is worth it! But we took the ocean express train on the way down. They have a policy to not bring outside food in and will search your bag at the entrance. The food is ridiculously overpriced and they don't look extensively. We learned our lesson the first time. This year we brought plenty of food and water for the entire day. Lastly we took the MTR to Admiralty station and took the bus 629 (very easy to find). In that MTR station there is an official tourists office selling discounted Ocean Park tickets for HKD340 instead of the HKD385. It's worth it to buy your tickets there: cheaper and faster entrance."

Also when you ride the cable car, they'll take your picture. You can purchase your picture without the frame - but they won't let you know that unless you ask.

We saw the Money and the Panda enclosures was fun. Then we went to the Rides on the top section of the park. The rides are terrifying, you should try the \"HAIR RAISER\" and the ship. The food is good too, but the menu is small. Again as an Indian , found very less options for myself. There are many things you can do. For kids it really a great place, there are fun games, for them. We then visited the Aquarium which was the second best thing here. They have Sting Rays, Sharks and really rare species of fish. And ofcourse King Crabs and Octopuses, awesome Experience. First time this close to an Octopus. The best part was the Water , Fireworks and Pyro show. This show tells about how the world same into existence when Fire and Water Dragon made peace. The whole story and the firworks and pyro setup was AMAZING, a amust see again if you plan to stay here till closing time. We also saw ice performers which was fun."

As the name suggests, unlike Disney which does not have live animals, the USP of Ocean park is the the recreation of habitats and the presence of animals. You could see sharks, seals, dolphins, penguins, bears, and other marine life in all its splendour. I some how could not understand why they need to keep rides in an \"Ocean Park\" as that was distracting from the main theme of getting to see Marine life.. Not that the rides were bad, but some of them were not for the faint hearted...I was not very impressed with the signage for directions and the the rather low number of customer service volunteers for support. Considering i visited during a busy holiday season, they needed to have more volunteers on the ground to help visitors. I was stuck on a couple of occasions where i had to seek directions, and then had to walk a long way back.all in all its definitely a must in any HK itinerary and worth the time and effort.How To reach: Reaching the park is pretty easy with Direct bus services from the park connecting to Admiralty and central stations on the MTR network.Traveler tips: suggestion would be to reach the park as soon as it opens, so that you could do all the themes before it closes."

We reached and were allowed inside even before the Ocean Park opened and with prepaid tickets already, were among the first few to enjoy the impressive Cable Ride, which carried us across mountains and oceans, as soon as the Park officially opened. Two pairs of cable cars run both ways all the time. You could also capture full view of the entire Airport from the Cable Car. On the Return journey we took the Ocean Express, which has an interesting Submarine theme.The Roller Coaster rides at the Summit truly capture the essence of the beauty of this massive place and its scenic setting. You wished the roller coasters stopped for a moment to enjoy this sublime beauty. At the Summit, the rides/attractions are at various levels and corners. Signage/Orientation is little and confusing sometimes and unless you have the proper orientation you may end up walking a lot while you could have easily taken an Escalator nearby. Look for the nearest Escalator to save time and energy on walking. The Ocean Theatre itself has a brilliant setting. However, the Dolphin Show at the Ocean Theatre was dull and boring. The Jelly fish encounter was superb and an interesting see. We missed the Kaleidoscope Ice Spectacular, which we regret till date. However, we did see an Excellent Stunt performance at the Waterfront Plaza.A visit to the Ocean Park would be incomplete without seeing the Giant Pandas. We were lucky to spot a few of them. Vegetarian/Vegan food is a big concern while other food is way too expensive."

The are several sections, incuding aquariums, Panda Bears, Penguins, Dolphin shows, Sharks, Seals and a \"tunnel aquarium\" The rides are far too many to mention but they cater for those who love scary sppedy rides and the more sedate. The major attraction is the hair raiser which is a roller coaster on the edge of the mountain. There are also other roller coasters, and some unique rides. The park is huge and the only downfalls is that its virtually impossible to finish it in a day which means you have to either miss some of the attractions or buy another ticket the next day. However, they generally have fast moving queues with stipulated times. The MTR station is being built which means that travelling here will be even easier soon. An absolute must do for any visitor to Hong Kong"

The giant pandas were pretty cool too.The view from the cable car is fantastic. It lets you get the lay of the land, and see how they built what are essentially two separate parks.We're not big roller coaster people, so we only did the mine train. Pretty tame compared to the other rides they have (at least by appearance). Food was decent, but expectedly expensive. The shark exhibit was OK, but more crowded than the rest of the place, and in a very narrow series of walkways that just got claustrophobic. The aquarium, however, was spectacular. We took the city bus (629) from Admiralty directly to the main gate. While there was a line, it is very efficient. Would STRONGLY recommend buying tickets before you get to the gate -- they are sold (at a discount) in the MTR station, just before you exit for the bus, and in the line at the bus (At full price). The MTR tickets are sold at about a $30HK discount (approx $4US), but with a wait that may make you want to pay full price just to avoid the line. (By the way, the MTR also sells discounted Disney tickets.)This was a pretty good way to ignore jet lag - we went on our first day here - and walked enough to fall asleep easily."

Our family could not cover all areas and had completely missed the area where there were may kids rides including a giant ferris wheel.

I only have a very vague recollection of that trip but somehow I don't recall the park being as massive at it seemed in this most recent visit. My family and I purchased discounted tickets online and it was well worth it as we managed to skip the queues at the ticket stalls. We took the 629 bus from Admiralty station on a Wednesday arriving at the bus terminal just past 10 AM. There was already a queue but it moved fast as the buses were plentiful and dispatch was quick. I expect on a weekend the picture may be different. In any case, the kids enjoyed the rides and attractions. We were not able to watch any of the shows on tap but still very much worthwhile despite this. The queues at the popular rides went up as high as 30 minutes but WiFi was free and available and you could while away the wait on your smartphone or tablet. Food was expensive, which was quite expected as with other theme parks. It was cloudy during our visit, which made conditions more pleasant and walking around less arduous. This was my one complaint in fact. Other theme parks usually have trains or cable cars that connect the major sites in the park. Ocean Park did have this but only between the entrance and the Summit areas, where you can take either the Ocean Express train or the Cable Car. But the wide expanse of areas even at the Summit alone proved quite difficult to walk particularly those areas that required either a climb up or down lengths of stairs. Had it been a hotter day than it was, then I don't think it would have been a pleasant visit. I suppose the park can think up ways on how to facilitate movement of people between the various themed areas that will not unduly impact the look and feel of the park."

Only other dryers were the ones you put your hands in and out of; found one in a parents room, locked the door and spent nearly an hour putting my jeans and coat in and out to get them dry enough to wear (the air being blown out was COLD so it took ages!). Imagine this to be almost a passable ride on a hot day (though still not sure what is entertaining about sitting in a big tube whilst water is squirted right at you) but in winter it was just horrid. It was enough to ruin my day and turn me off Ocean Park full-stop. My son enjoyed himself and it was not an expensive day out by theme park standards.

The attitude is rather casual, though better than in Disneyland. Shows were not quite polished, mainly leaving it to the animals and trainers to charm (if they feel like it).Rides are a lot more exciting than Disneyland's, so would appeal more to older kids and adults who don't care about cartoon characters.

Apart from that, there's this huge crowd of tourists from the mainland China who are really loud, doesn't seems like understand or know simple basic courtesy as in queing, how to use public restroom (flush please), or even walk without hitting anyone on your way.apart from that, the theme park itself got potential with its own 'local' charm. I do recommend the cable car. Kids love to see the big aquarium with jelly fish, sting rays, sharks and all. They especially love the dolphins."

After the performance they allow some audiences to take photos with the performers and stop the queue when it came to a limit. We were in the queue unfortunately one of our kid was not allowed to join the queue due to the numbers of person allowed had reached the limit..well understood. What surprised me was the attitude of the staff handling this matter in a rude manner. They shouted to the kid not to join the queue in bad manner. Why did they behave badly to such a young kid? Can't they talk politely as they are in the customer service line and need to be good to customer no matter what. We paid the for the ticket and that pays their salary...why were the staff behaved arrogantly to customers? If they were tired..they should have not show it to customers. I hope the management will look into this matter and train the staff again to serve customers better in future. Eventhough we had good time with the rides, I was pissed off with the staff and they had spoiled my day at Ocean Park....the theme park with rude staff!!"

I was expecting a rather dated, old park, but instead I was impressed with how large and well-organized it was, and how many activities they had that catered to children of different ages. HK Disneyland may have taken some of the thunder from this old favorite, but this made the experience more enjoyable as there were no queues at all for any of the rides, and my toddler went repeatedly on all the rides in Whiskers Harbour, the area for small kids. I do have to say though, that because it is an old park, it is not THAT stroller friendly. There were parts like, embarking the cable car, that we had to carry and fold the stroller, then getting out there was a flight of steps (about 15-20 steps) where there was no way up but to carry the stroller up! Also trying to get into the theatre, oh my - steps, steps, steps\u2026 there is wheelchair access but you do sometimes have to take the (very) long route around. And if you decide to go down to the waterfront (where the big ferris feel and viking ship are located)\u2026 be prepared for the walk back UP\u2026 with a 20kg toddler in a stroller pushing back uphill, I nearly expired! You can take the \"Ocean Train\" as an alternative to the cable car, but its really just a train (with TVs on top that play images of the sea to make you feel like you are underwater\u2026 meh) \u2026 the cable car is much nicer, but steps everywhere. Still, overall we really enjoyed this! A very different experience for HK Disneyland, but really lovely with oceanfront scenery."

Signages for the train down were not explicit enough from the closed-down escalator and the jostling for the train were not well controlled especially from the tour groups. The Summit and the Shark enclosure were something new but more for kids whilst the Panda and Crocodile Marsh was better for viewing the Pandas feeding on bamboo leaves, as opposed to the other enclosure where we could not see them as they were inside the resting enclosure, except for the lively monkeys. They should have more seating at the Chicken outlet as these were shared with those that had Macs. Do get there by 10am before the busses with tour groups arrive.If you have younger kids, they would enjoy and be happier at Disney!"

We took a fast bus but didn't realize that you have to request the stop. We ended up backtracking several blocks with the help of a cellphone map app. There are two basic parts to the park. Be sure to get a map (there are Chinese and English versions). Near the entrance is a nice fountain display. On the lower section there is an aquarium which is okay but limited. Next to the aquarium is a panda exhibit but they were all inside. There is a better display in the exhibit \"Amazing Asian Animals\". Avoid the \"Emerald Trail. There is really not much to see and you keep coming to \"staff only\" roadblocks. I always like a carousel, but the line was long for the one in Aqua City and the ride was about 1- 1 1/2 minutes.We took the cable car to the other side of the park - rather intimidating but good views of the harbor (not so good if you don't like heights). The Terrace Cafe was a nice place to stop after the cable ride. Food portions were huge. The top was broken into several sections, each interesting. The thrill rides are here, but there are also some great animal exhibits and the carnival type games. The dolphin show was good, but not like Sea World. Go before the last show, as it is not easy to see when it is getting darker. Plan on spending the majority of the day in the upper section of the park. Then be sure to leave in plenty of time to see the evening light show in the lower park section. (We left the upper part a little late so missed most of it). Take a taxi back, It is much easier."

It is a fun filled park with lot of attractions and shows, made more interesting with a funicular and a cable-car for traveling between the two zones. We enjoyed it more than Hong Kong Disneyland. Plus points:  Only 20-25 mins bus ride if you are in Hong Kong island. Good bus connectivity. Ease of purchasing tickets.Enjoyable. Family friendly. Has something for all ages. Adequate signage. Value for money. Permits carrying of own foodMinuses : It is spread out over a large area so be prepared to walk. You will be rushing against timeExtremely crowded due to group tours from Mainland China. So be prepared for loooonnng queues, pushing and jostling at times to the point of being rude.Most of the shows were in Chinese.Random Tips : 1. Take the bus from the bus stand adjacent to Admirality MRT Station Exit B. You can buy park tickets alongwith return bus tickets to avoid queues at the Park. The bus accepts Octopus Card for the bus fare. The bus drop and pickup point is right in front of the Park gate.2. Start early if you want to experience all the attractions in ONE DAY. Some deft planning is required to keep with the schedule. USE THE PARK MAP AND SHOW SCHEDULE. We were at the gates at opening time but still could not finish all the attractions.3. Avoid weekends/ holidays at all cost. You may land up spending half the day standing in queues.4. Do not miss the Dolphin and the Sea Lion show.5. Stay till the end to experience the amazing SYMBIO, the dancing musical fountain with fireworks and other light effects. It is worth the wait.6. Do one way by the funicular and the other by cable-car.7. Lot of photo opportunity at the hill tops. Do carry your camera.8. IF YOU ARE FORCED TO PUSH AND JOSTLE....BE FIRM AND HOLD YOUR POSITION..else you may remain rooted to the same place all day long.Enjoy it because it is enjoyable. Have a fun filled day...."

My son and I frequently visited Ocean Park during the weekdays to avoid lines and to visit as many toddler-friendly locations before his afternoon nap. We arrived at 10:00 when it opened and went immediately to the train that takes you up to the mountain. (This part might not open until 10:30) Since everyone gets busy taking pictures by the front gate and trying to ride the gondolas up the mountain, you bypass everyone to enjoy the animal exhibits up top (bring a jacket for the penguin exhibit). After spending the morning in the upper section, take the gondola down the mountain before lunch when no one is going that direction. Lunch options are quite limited but I found the Chinese food court near the train station at the base of the mountain to be decent. Spend the afternoon at the bottom portion where there is a great playground area for the toddlers and a few toddler-friendly rides. Bring serious bugspray if you wear shorts since the Hong Kong sand fleas are rampant in the playground area."

The park is lovely and the shows and exhibits are great but my teenagers just got 2 rides the entire day due to the long waiting times. We also found the areas near the summit confusing. Lots of walking up and down steep hills to access areas. Not fun on a hot day. The park was great but crowd control and signage and better accessibility to the summit attractions with the addition of a mini train or people mover, needs to learn a lesson or 2 from the Disney people."

And the Panda, aquarium and some small rides for kids were enjoyed by my younger daughter. This is a huge place and needs a lot of walking. If you have small kids do rent a stroller. It may become difficult otherwise. The park has a website and I suggest one should book online tisane time. There is a cable car ride and ocean express to travel between to parts of the park. We used both of them on our return trip. It's a good experience and not to be missed. The attractions are scattered and one needs to walk a lot. If you want to enjoy all rides you may need 2 days (considering the long queues) here. We spent only a day here.The park is open with very little shade at places hence caps/hats are must.

It was such a huge disappointment. There place was rather crowded. It started to rain heavily when we are there. There's not much we can do as we don't have umbrella and raincoat with us. I was thinking of buying raincoats but not able to get one as we are not near any of the gift shops. Actually we are at one of the water attractions, taking shelter. I thought those water attractions will sell raincoats but there is none. As the rain doesn't seem going to stop, we moved off when it was drizzling. As my kids were hungry, we stopped by a nearby caf\u00e9. We were shocked at the price of the snacks, they were so expensive. 5 pieces of mid wings, french fries and soft drink cost HK$105 (S$23). As the weather was so cold, we wanted to change the drink to hot drink, there was none. Really ridiculous.The staff in the park there were not helpful too. I find them rather rude in their attitude. As the weather or wind conditions not favourable, cable car was not available.Since the rain not going to stop soon and we are feeling wet and cold. We decided to head back to the hotel. We need to take a cab back to the hotel.The queue was rather long and not many taxi available. We waited for over an hour to get a taxi.Quite disappointed with HK this time round. I would say that it is not worth to make a trip to Ocean Park."

We bypassed all the rides as we wanted to explore Marine World before watching Ocean Wonders. To our surprise, we were blocked at the Marine World entrance. We were told to wait until 11am (whereas website opening hour for the Marine Park attractions were 10.30am).We were happy to see that the animals in Ocean Wonders show had a gigantic pool to swim in, larger than some of the other aquatic pools in other countries. However, our view was partially obscured by audience who were holding up umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun's rays. Whilst the animal performance was good, the storyline was weak and not entertaining. We thought that Farglory Ocean Park in Hualien (Taiwan) did a better job in keeping audience amused with anecdotes and jokes.The rides in the park were not designed with young kids in mind. Most have a height restriction and hence my younger son could only participate in game stalls. My older daughter was slightly above the height restriction but we felt that some of the rides were dangerous for petite-sized kids and I feared she would slip under the bars, particularly Rev Booster. Perhaps they ought to review and increase the height requirement further. Or maybe learn from Disneyland, where staff would advise the child to sit inside and the adult outside so that the adult doesn't squash the child when the ride is moving.As others have pointed out, the park is huge and the rides are spaced far apart. We had to walk long distances to reach one ride after another, and sometimes it makes me wonder if I have walked in the wrong direction. A little pre-planning and good map reading skills would have helped.What we really liked were the scenic views from various lookouts. Something that not all parks have."

I remember how I loved the cable car back then. The rest was just a blur; although I know I tried several rides as I love amusement parks. And I am a sucker for all types of rides.The first thing I noticed when we entered was how huge the place is. I read that the management decided to infuse billions of HK$ to improve the place because they have to compete with Disneyland. So I excitedly walked around to discover what was done to the place. Since Ocean park in situated in the hills, one has to walk quite a bit going up & down to get to the attractions. IF you are physically fit and it isn't a hot day, this should NOT be a problem. But one has to be prepared to WALK. We immediately went to the cable car station. The line was quite long but we patiently waited until it was our turn to board. It is still as breathtaking as I remembered! Part of the way was the view of the high, lush hills and part of it was the view of the Hong Kong ocean. Simply beautiful! After we got off the cable car, we walked around to explore the different attractions and rides that we can try. The signs are quite confusing. We got lost several times before we would find the attractions we were looking for. When I needed to freshen up and looked for the toilets, I was disappointed to see that for a huge place, the management didn't invest enough in building more toilets for the customers to use. We also noticed that there were NOT enough restaurants where customers can chose refreshments and food. Also there were not enough tables and chairs where you can sit and enjoy whatever food you finally end up buying. The tables & chairs are situated out in the open so IF you happen to go there on a sweltering day, then you will have to eat your food in the heat, too. Not very pleasant and relaxing.We tried a ride called something \"express\" but it was just a ride to transport us to the next area. The attractions we viewed i.e. shark place, sturgeon, and the aquarium were just so - so. Overall, we were quite disappointed in the whole place. Specially since so much money was spent to improve the park. We actually think that the double decker bus that brought us to Ocean park was a more exciting ride as we chose to sit in the very front seats on the upper deck! For the first time in my life, I left an amusement park way before the closing time!I certainly wont be returning to Ocean park in the near future. OH! In case you want to check out the place yourself, please google \"Klook.com\" so you can at least save 15% on the entrance tickets. Hope you enjoy yourself."

However, it did not take me long to get into the park and get my tickets. The ticketing officer was most helpful. She had checked which country I came from and explained the promotions which are applicable for me to the park. In the end, I have gotten a savings of 12percent.If you want a park with almost everything, this is one park you should go. It is an amalgamation of aquarium, zoo, carnival and rides! Had enjoyed the carnival and rides most. Some of the rides are not for the weak hearted. This park has a roller coaster ride with full view of the sea. Beautiful view when getting a dosage of thrill during the ride. The cable car is another wonderful part not to be missed. Is priced in the ticket already. You get a breathtaking view of the sea while the ride span across two hill tops. On it, you will also get to see the whole part. Thoroughly enjoyed my trip there. Highly recommended."

My advise is to cover summit first. 3 ways to summit, they are cable ride with long wait time(absolutely amazing views of sea on one side and Aberdeen with stunning tall buildings and beautiful green mountains on other side). another ocean express( the fastest way to reach summit ), escalators (only one way I.e upwards to summit with beautiful looks but time consuming and strenuous.Reach early by 9:30 and try to go for cable ride but check the waiting time not more than 15 mins, otherwise you may miss on some thrilling rides as it closes by 6:30.I first went for hair raiser the most enthralling rides of all. Had wait time of 50 mins but was worth. Its superb enthralling roller coaster ride with great trajectory path, curves, and speed. Its not meant for weak hearted, bp and heart patients. It sets your nerve pulsating. The speed, height and curvaceous trajectory at which you are upside down makes you feel you are gone.Its absolutely breath taking ride.The other rides I liked was flash, dragon, whirly birds, rev booster, the Abyss, Ocean park tower, flying swing, mine train, the rapids (water fun ride which can make you wet. Its fun getting wet.The polar adventure has north pole and South pole animal encounter where one can see arctic fox, walrus, seal and so on.Marine world had shark mystique, sea jelly spectacular which is worth watching. The pandas, koalas,kangaroo's are worth watching. Old Hong Kong too.The grand aquarium and dolphin show too. The last but the best is symbio absolutely amazing water light dragon show which sets water on fire.So plan well on weekdays and if you can get maps in advance, it would be great."

            "review": "Excellent Animal Exhibits... Rides Iffy. Ocean Park is comparable to Sea World in that it has a fairly even split with animal encounters and rides. Ocean Park excels in animal exhibits, but not exactly the rides. The polar animals, pandas, Australia animals, Grand Aquarium, sea lions, and jellyfish all have really beautiful exhibits. There are some creative viewing opportunities and I felt that I saw active animals in all of the areas. Many times with zoos, it seems I either don't see the featured animal or it is sleeping. I don't know if the unique layouts or in-park animal enrichment helps here, but it was a great animal experience. Don't forget to see the jellyfish exhibit! As for the rides, they seemed rather dated and just not fun. The big roller coaster, the Hair Raiser, is in desperate need of a little maintenance as it is quite a jarring experience. The lone bright spot was the cable car from one side of the park to the next. Otherwise, don't plan on coming for the rides. A lot of guidebooks suggest Ocean Park over Disneyland and that is an absolutely ridiculous suggestion. Ocean Park is nice for what it is. It has above average animal experiences with a collection of mediocre rides. Disneyland is the far better experience if you just have one day for amusement parks during your Hong Kong visit."

I'm glad we went and highly recommend the park but want to be sure you know that it isn't for everyone. If you can't walk far with out a break have issues walking up steep inclines or can't handle multiple steps you will be very challenged here. I am physically fit but have to say I found the park exhausting. You take a train or cable car to the highest part of the park but as the park sits on a hillside and had many rides spread about it is a very physical day. I saw parents pushing strollers up and down hills and toddlers running down steep hills and thought oh, my I'm so glad my child is older(10)! The rides are fun, the panda was wonderful to see and the view of the Ocean from the rides was amazing. There were not a lot of places to sit and rest. Benches were few and far between. I'm glad I went, have no desire to go again but really want you to know you will be in for a good hike through the park. This is no Disney, easy access kind of park."

There was so much to see that we didn't get to everything despite being there almost open to close (6:30 pm). The shark exhibit was the best I've ever seen. They had a ton of shows, my favorite was the dolphin show. We saw 3 shows altogether but the other two were in Chinese. They had a kids area which our 3 year old loved, which included rides, a bounce house and a large play area. They had an awesome water show at closing but we didn't stay to watch the whole thing, definitely will next time. To get to the summit we rode a cable car which was an amazing experience. The return trip was a simulated submarine which gave the illusion of being underwater.Recommendations: visit the MTR ticket office at the Admiralty Station for discount tickets and consider the 2-days ticket if you have time."

Come early to beat the queue for the rides and short queue to ride the cable car to the other part of the park behind the hill. Make sure to ride the cable car once as the view is nice. We came back to the main entrance using the Ocean Express, another fun experience as if we were going underground. Do visit Pacific Pier as the view from there is serene. We enjoyed the animal exhibits as well, especially the walrus and the panda.We bought the park ticket in town but a kiosk just outside Admiralty MTR sell discounted ticket. The CIty Bus 926 can be paid using Octopus card so no need to queue for bus ticket. Overall, very smooth travel to and from the park, short waiting time as many buses are available right outside Admiralty MTR."

Food n drinks are expensive but there are drinking fountains there. McD is probably the cheapest food there. Overall it is also quite an educational trip with an emphasis on taking care of the environment in particular the ocean. Go early. Take the rides first.

Show times are limited. When somebody will waste lot of time in queue then he has to miss number of shows either or some rides. It is very difficult to handle yourself on weekdays.

This attraction is much cheaper than disneyland and I believe much bigger as they have 2 different section separated by a cable car ride/train ride. The theme park is very educational as every aspect of the park will educate you about saving the world. This is good as we are a group with very young kids. So we took some time to explain to them the destructive effect human is causing. The park opens at 10.30am till 6.30pm. Go when the park open as you will not have time to cover the whole park even if you stayed till 6.30pm. At 6.30pm there will be a water/fire/fireworks show at the fountain near the park entrance. But if you stayed till 6.30pm, be prepared to queue for the bus back as you will be fighting with the rest. Bus 629 from Admiralty travels to Ocean Park for about 30mins. Only one outlet for halal food. Best to bring your own food if you are a muslim as the halal outlet is very seasonal. Sometimes there is food sometimes there isn't. If the security stops you, just be nice and explain politely your needs for halal food. You can view from my photos the halal menu at the outlet. The location of the outlet is clearly indicated in the park map."

One side is an aquarium and small zoo type area ( with Pandas) and the other is rollercoasters and theme park area. Worth taking the cable car at some point as they are a bit hair raising but give you great views of the bay. Take your own water though as they charge you 5 times the normal price once you are in the park. Easy to get to by using ghe express but going from the bus terminal at Central station, think its bus 627 and costs about 10 HKD each way."

You can either get the cable car (which there was a bit of a queue for) or the train (less of a queue) to the ride section. The rides feel very safe - some of them are well scary! But brilliant. We spent all day here and at the end of the day there's a light show at the fountain at the entrance/exit. Loads of shops for gifts. Food fairly expensive but to be expected at a theme park - bringing your own maybe better."

You can ride the MTR going to the Admiralty, then go out at Exit B and hop on to Citybus 629. I recommend buying tickets beforehand to avoid the long queue at the site itself (I bought our admission tickets in the Citybus Ticket Booth in Admiralty Station)."

We visited Ocean Park back in 2010 and decided to come back this year as our daughters were big enough to enjoy more of the rides. The park has changed and is undergoing massive change which will see it transform yet again. We enjoyed our day but felt that the constant pushing of photo opportunities and merchandising didn't sit right. Also check all the ride descriptions and children's height before you go as small children will not be allowed on several of the rides (even those which are fairly tame compared to other theme parks). Food options are uninspiring, expensive and often inedible but that's fairly standard across all theme parks - stick to snack items and don't expect much. The pandas, arctic wolves and aquarium were some of our favourites."

If I was advising management I would be encouraging them to do some team building and staff development around being friendly and welcoming.If you have time and are in Hong Kong this is a good place to go!"

The glass wall is easy to see through (kept very clean) and there is an attendant who gives you tips of the best place to take a photo from and will even take the photo for you with the panda and you in the photo - the ultimate selfie shot! I could have stayed and watched these adorable animals for hours - they are so playful and photogenic.Lots of other interesting stuff to see & do - great for the kids.

By midday the line up was ridiculous, I'm so glad we made it the first thing to do.The Ocean Express is another way to get to and from the Summit, I assumed it was just a train, boy how wrong could I have been, it was an amazing ride in itself, *make sure you ride this train!!*Adventure Land was being renovated when we visited so it was closed to the public.I loved the Giant Pandas, the Goldfish Treasures, the Polar Adventures and my favourite was the Grand Aquarium.The Australia exhibit wasn't worth the wait, I suppose because I am from Australia but really I thought it was a waste of time.I will never forget our day at Ocean Park :)"

The queues for the rides were not too long (apart from the cable car). So overall, definitely worth a visit. And watch the Ocean Theatre show."

Caught the 629 bus from Admiralty Station for $10.6 which takes you direct to the park entrance, we arrived at 10:10am and I was suprised how busy it was with large school parties and tour groups already waiting to enter the park. Managed to get a 10% discount on entry tickets by producng our tickets for the Lantau Cable car ride. Went straight to the giant panda exhibit however the keepeers were still cleaning the enclosure but after a short wait one of the pandas made an appearace. Then went to the grand Aquarium which was quite impressive with its displays, in particular the sharks and rays. The Asian Animal Wonders exhibit has some more active younger pandas and red Pandas on display. The wait in line for the cable car was in excess of 45 mins so opted for the funicular train which was quick and no queue. A lot of rides at thee top but just visdited the seals, shark mystique, sturgeon exhibit and jellyfish - al of which were interesting and well presented. Returned to the lower area by cable car and suprisingly there was no queue at the top. It's a big park and if you wanted todo rides and visit the animal exhibits there is no way a day visit would be long enough. On exiting there were dozens of tour groups arriving by coach yet a member of staff said it was a quiet day.Wouldn't want to visit on a busy day then."

Tickets can be bought easily at 7-Eleven shops and costs just HK$ 345 for adults per person and HK$ 173 for children. You better start your visit as early as you can because one day is not enough to visit all of the attractions inside the park and other activities. On weekend, public holidays and festival time; it is literally crowded and waiting time could be more on every games and other shows. It is really a great place to have fun with family, friends and your kids and further more a knowledgeable too. Live shows of Dolphins and Seals are shown which is really fun to watch and life time memorable event. Have a great day."

The Park itself is amazing where you see Penguins and Pandas and Dolphins and sharks and sea lions. The rollercoasters ride are strategically placed on top the hill on the cliff sides, which give the feel of falling into water. But coming back to Halloween at Ocean Park, its a lifetime experience. The park is open till midnight with proper elaborate costume characters walking all around very convincing in their character. The decor is spooky and the characters scare you and take you by surprise number of times. There are ghost flash mobs by amazing skeleton and clown dancers, rock concerts, other special spooky performances like Hellympics and horror zones like walking dead which take your breathe away. Its unbelievable how the park has invested in Halloween but its one experience one should not miss"

The place has been significantly renovated in recent years, with newer exhibits like Old Hong Kong and Goldfish Treasures making up a few of the nicer little diversions. Panda Village was adorable, with both red pandas and HKs famous giant pandas gifted from the mainland in 2007- they are situated in an air conditioned, covered grassy enclosure designed to simulate the Chinese mountainside habitats the bamboo giants now inhabit. While the enclosure seemed a little small, the pandas seemed happy and were a highlight of our day.One major disappointment we did not foresee was the extortionate food prices, with hindsight this should have been expected given that once inside you have no choice but to pay $40 for a hot dog or $25 for a bottle of water (almost 5x the price in the street). The queues were absolutely packed for the cable car with crowds and crowds of day trippers from across the border. While walking from halfway along the queue to join the end, the waiting time increased by 15 minutes. Other than the crowds and the food prices, we still enjoyed the beautiful sea lions and the view from the cable car over Deep Water Bay and the park itself was really pleasant. Probably better to pack your own lunch, and if you go mentally prepared to wait in queues fairly often you will most likely have a good experience."

You need to take either the train or cable cars up to the other side of the park, but both provide a great trip/views in the process.I would remember going early in the morning, as it starts to get crowded and wait lines get longer after lunch.We went on a Monday when the park opened and it was less than 5 mins wait to go on any rides. But after lunch, wait times extended out to 20+ mins.The park offers strollers for hire, and they are worth it. Not only does it save you from carrying tired little ones, it means you go in a separate, and most beneficially faster! queues even when its busy.Worth the money it costs to get in here.The only thing it was lacking was a pool - which apparently is what is going in at the moment (which explains the construction at the entrance)."

Ocean Park is a theme park with conservation at its heart. the are giant pandas, red pandas, koala bears; dolphins, penguins many many other wildlife exhibits. All these are built within the site which has 2 main areas separated by a mountain with a lovely cable car ride or a subterranean cable railway connecting the areas. At busy times there can be long queues for the popular attractions and rides. there are rides for all ages from infants to roller junkies! all beautifully landscaped into the coastal site. There are special themed periods e.g. Halloween when the site is decorated throughout. The day is not cheap but all profits go into conservation research."

For other pickup points or other modes of transport, you can check their website for details.This is a great place to spent a full day at. Ranging from thrilling rides to viewing of animals, shows, it is a place filled with endless things to do! You can spend the whole day here, especially like now, when during the Halloween season: it opens from 10:30 am - 11 pm. for Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. It is a must-go for people who enjoy being scared haha! Their extremely scary attractions are really worth queuing for, and there are 6 of them! Other than that, you are still able to play the other normal rides in the park. Along the way in the park, prepared to be greeted by different scary characters and you can take photos with them. They may sneak up behind you and suddenly scare you. HAHA!I would love to visit again during Halloween next year!!!"

They will do their best just to annoy you and trod on you whilst you are waiting patiently in the queues. The rides themselves generally had waiting times of over 40 minutes and even aquariums were full. I wouldn't recommend buying too much food from the stalls as they were overpriced compared with other theme parks. Never get a spaghetti bolognese from the park....it was brown and revolting. ;)"

I went first to the panda enclosure.It is a thrill to see the large panda up close chowing down on bamboo. There were only a few visitors in the enclosure which made it so enjoyable.I took the Ocean Express train to the upper level. Some may prefer the cable car, but for those who have vertigo like me the train is the way to go.One highlight for me was the penguin enclosure. Dozens of adorable penguins standing on ice or swimming. Bring a jacket; its very cold!A super attraction is the river rafting. For those who might not be brave enough to go river rafting, here's a chance to sample it in a safe way.After taking the train back to the lower level, I visited Old Hong Kong, which gives visitors an opportunity to see what Hong Kong was like years ago.Another highlight is the Australia enclosure. There are adorable koalas munching on eucalyptus leaves in the trees and wallibies hopping around.The huge aquarium is brilliant.These are my personal favorites in the park but there is much more. There are places to eat, beautiful views from the upper level, and courteous park staff to answer questions.Buy a ticket at Admiralty MTR station and get 10% off. Then take the 629 bus from Admiralty to the Ocean Park entrance."

            "review": "Amazing Experience. Don't miss it. I experienced Ocean park on my second trip to Hong Kong and the first thing that crossed my mind was WHY DID I NOT DO THIS THE LAST TIME!!!Ocean's park has something for all age groups. From cute pandas to high thrill rides there is something for everyone. Thrill mountain is a perfect recipe for adventure junkies. Definitely try the hair raiser at least twice. I'll summarize my experience in the form of tips that might help people visiting the place:1. Needless to say, if possible schedule the trip to ocean's park on a weekday (preferably sometime between Monday and Thursday). You can beat the crowd and enjoy to the fullest.2. Buy your ticket through Klook. They offer you a discount of HKD 50 per ticket. Booking is instant and you can skip the ticket queues at the park.3. The park timings sometimes tend to change. Make sure you know the opening and closing times for the park on the day you visit. Arrive at the park 15 minutes before it is scheduled to open.4. As soon as you enter the park, there is a locker room on the immediate right. Store all your luggage there at the earliest. Its very convenient. Its a keyless system. Once you pay for a locker, you can set a 4 digit pin and that will be valid for the whole day. 5. The first thing you should do take the ocean express (train) to the summit station. 6. Thrill mountain first: The thrill mountain is located on the summit. This has 4 high thrill rides. Go for this first. Make sure you ride the hair raiser first and then the flash. These are two of the most popular rides in the park. As the day goes, the waiting time for these rides range between 30 min to 90 minutes on a weekday (maybe longer on weekends). I went for hair raiser first and got the seat on the first row in 5 min. After this, I immediately went for the flash. I was done with both the rides in 20 min. If you decide to keep this for later, you will waster hours of precious time waiting in queues. 7. The park is divided into zones: Each zone has a theme and rides associated with that theme. Use the map provided to you at the entrance (for free) and cover the park in a systematic manner to ensure you don't miss anything.8. Popular rides which normally attracts queues: Hair Raiser, Flash, Raging River, Mine Train, Make sure you cover these in the first half. The park is generally more crowded in the second half and thus the lines become bigger. 9. There are display boards at many places which show you the waiting time for all rides. If you find a ride you want to go with less waiting time (<30 min) go for it immediately. Make hay while the sun shines)10. Getting a gopro is not of much use. I wanted to create videos of all rides. But the staff out there are very sharp to hunt down on any video recording device however well you hide them (Trust me I tried). In the end, you will just be carrying it around and leaving it by the side for every ride. 11. Raging river is the only place you will get wet. Swimwear not required in this park. 12. Keep a note of all showtimes. The ideal time to watch the shows would be in the afternoon. This is when you will be tired from the walking and the rides. You can enjoy the shows while having a light meal and drink (Do not have a heavy lunch. You will regret it if you want to repeat any of the high thrill rides)I think I have covered everything I experienced during my trip to ocean's park. Don't miss this place."

First of all the landscape from the park is amazing! The park is quite big so you have a long way to walk there so get a comfortable shoes and get ready to be wet there , me and my wife have been there on Friday morning from 11:00 (park open at 10:30) until 22:30 (park close at 23:00) and we almost did all the rides in the park, because of Halloween events there the park was already full at 10:30, the waiting time for each ride was between 10-15 min to 45-50 min depends which ride and what time u try to go there, I really recommend you to buy a ticket before so you won't need to wait there to buy tickets, we bought our tickets on the \"seven eleven\" shops around 350$.The overhaul experience was really good and the rides there was really fun, but I think that without the Halloween special activities it was less fun and we probably stay there for less time.If you kind of person that can't wait for long time for each ride you can buy the premium Vip ticket that usually cost twice the price (but still affordable, around 60\u20ac) and u have a special entrance for each ride that u just pass all the long waiting time and just get in.But the Chinese know how to manage this queues and it goes pretty fast (except 2-3 rides that we really waited for long time) if you can be there at Halloween time I really really recommend you that and also recommend you to buy the Vip ticket so you won't spend time for waiting like us, it could cut us 2-4 hours of free time to do something else.They made some scary rides there specially for Halloween that really well made (one of them was \"the walking dead\" that u escape zombies) and u got a trick or treat path that u get a bag and get candies :)So I really recommend u to go there, the entrance is not expensive and even if it's not Halloween u still have lots to do there (like the big aquarium there and some places u can see dolphins and more animals)Lots of fun for couples, families and even alone"

After travelling around various Panda enclosures in mainland China, and back home at Edinburgh Zoo, it was here at Ocean Park I finally got to see a Panda take a walk (albeit only for around 10ft).After dark is when the park sprang to life and the Halloween decorations came into their own. The staff who were dressed in costumes looked incredible and were happy to pose for a photo or two.At this time the park was promoting The Walking Dead fairly heavily, I suppose to coincide with the release of season 6. Personally as a huge Walking Dead fan I loved this, so thank you Ocean Park for one amazing day.Take a day here as you'll need it, and the rest, to see everything."

In addition to the usual attractions; cable car, aquarium, animals, shows and thrill rides, there is almost always something new in the park each time we've visited. My advice would be to plan your visit to visit the 'top' attraction ie top park first as it gets very busy up there in the afternoon. We've found that going up in the submarine and coming back down around 2pm in the cable car works best as the queues always seem to be shortest then. A season ticket also gives you chance to book seats at shows at a time of your choosing and this tends to be less crowded. A great park overall"

In its goal of becoming Asia's leading zoologically-focused theme park, if that is indeed its goal, Ocean Park tries to become all things to all men and is becoming too large, too complex, just too much. Poor signposting which loses you in mid journey to attractions, silly bureaucratic rules which prevent children from joining adults on some of the safer rides and other obstacles can make vidits tiring and frustrating. There is much that the park does well: the wonders of the jellyfish and the aquarium exhibits, which are excellent and the environmental awareness enhancing marine shows. There is much that could be improved: the food and beverage offering and some of the terrestrial exhibits. Why not provided some standard insulated clothing for the freezing cold penguin and arctic exhibits, which everyone wants to see but for which few are prepared ? These wraps could be distributed at the entrance and collected at the exit. There is a cavalier lack of attention to detail and a \"take it or leave it\" attitude which smacks of hubris and does nothing to enhance the value of the brand. Rather than grow, grow, grow into further unmanageable sprawl, why not rethink, disaggregate and create more profitable opportunities for enjoyment ?"

Ocean Park is everything Disneyland should have been and more. We thoroughly enjoyed Ocean Park and consider it a must see attraction in Hong Kong. The only negative I can think of is that if you are mobility challenged in any way, Ocean Park may be more than you are up to. You will walk ALOT. There is both a train and a tramway connecting the two sides of the park, but even so, you still walk a great deal. If walking is difficult for you, you may not enjoy this park as much as others.On the day we were there, the sky cars were running but only half of the cars were being used. So half the cars left the station empty. This resulted in quite a long line which seemed senseless. I asked one of the attendants why this was and she said, \"because we are only using half of the cars.\" That helped! NOT. LOLOther than that, we found the rides very good, the exhibits interesting and the street entertainers quite good. The walk through aquarium is a must see as is the Panda exhibit.The roller coasters were awesome unlike the ones at Disneyland which were mostly mediocre. Disneyland would still be the go to place if you have young children though.Getting to the park is a bit more challenge than getting to Disneyland. The MTR will take you close, then you must transfer to a bus for the remainder of the ride. There are plenty of signs directing you along the way, just follow the signs and you'll have no problems.The seal/Walarus exhibit was very good. We come from an area where seals live in abundance, so seeing them is pretty old hat for us. If you are not so blessed to live in such an area, I think the seal exhibit would be much more exciting. Still, who can not like watching seals play...besides Salmon fishermen I mean?"

My husband and I spent a few hours at the park and were very impressed with the huge acquariums which is the best we have ever seen .The only drawback are the queues to take the gondola ride to the acquariums. Theattendants instead of filling each one with at least 6 people, at times they let 1, 2 or 3 people go alone when there were about 300 people waiting to go! Very crazy! They should try to get people moving much quicker. The Park itself has excellent facilities and animals of interest."

Check it out at night when it has a show similar to Las Vegas Bellagio's Dancing Fountain.2. North Pole Encounter which has walruses.3. South Pole Spectacular. Dozens of penguins including king penguins.4. Space Wheel, Flash and Rollercoaster. Don't be a chicken. Do more than taking Ocean Park's cable cars. These extreme rides are scarily fun! But be prepared to wait in queues for these popular rides. 5. Grand Aquarium. Lots of fishes and stunning corals. Check out the Reef Tunnel (nice photo-op spot). This is the world's largest aquarium dome.6. Panda Sichuan. The highlight of my visit because I just love pandas and to see it up close is amazing!There were just so many attractions to see and rides to enjoy here that one day is not enough.Con: Bad and expensive food wherever we dined inside the park.Note: If you have younger children, better take them to Disneyland. As some reviewers shared, queues are long, the place requires a lot of walking and rides have height requirements. But if you're a group of friends or adults, this place is for you!"

We thoroughly enjoyed the different animal displays, the frigid temperatures in the north pole encounter and south pole spectacular were certainly a welcome relief from the unrelenting heat outside. There was also a great variety of rides to suit all ages. The first downside to this park is that everything is so spreadout and there is very little to no shade throughout. We ended up leaving without seeing everything as the heat made us exhausted. The other downside was that we couldn't easily find our way around - the park is a bit confusing. We would visit Ocean Park again though."

It appeared to be a relatively quiet day as the queues on the rides were short and it was easy to get into the shows. We enjoyed the rides and shows and decided it was time to go. As we had to go on the gondola to get back to the other side, we joined a very long queue which took 50 minutes. When we got to the lift we found that they were not filling the gondola cars which hold 6 people - there was only two of us in ours, and the one behind had 3, few were full, so we had waited way longer then necessary. Also we found the they were selling tickets to jump the queue, so we gathered that this was organised this way to have a long queue so to sell tickets to jump the queue. At one stage there was a big argument from people in the queue when the operators were putting people with tickets ahead of the queue. This is totally unacceptable, AVOID this place and go somewhere else."

It is very tiring walking between each attraction. Also really wish they have more places to take rest and with good shelter. Since the day we went was very sunny and hot, we had some problems.

The Funicular train ride climbing a near vertical hill to reach the Ocean Park is a wonderful way to start the magical experience. The ocean park is similar to the ones in Singapore & KL. However the the dolphin & seal show is stunningly brilliant. Dont miss. Check the timings.After a long day the return is a beautiful and long cable ride back to the base.Factor a whole day of fun; excitement and rides."

Avoid staying till late, there is a serious traffic jam of people trying to get out... and they all choose the train in which you are packed like sardines for the 2 minutes journey down to the exit. Getting a taxi down there is also an adventure... Not the best of experiences."

When there is high wind they don't run any of their rides which is super disappointing. We were able to get the cable car before they closed it down which was good. The animals and aquariums were awesome. Without those the park wouldn't be worth while without the rides. We caught the ocean Park bus from the station which was super easy. I recommend pre booking your tickets to avoid the massive lines and also get there before the park opens to avoid excessive queues to get in and for the cable car."

We were just here to see the Pandas so we made a bee line for them straight away. They were pretty much as I expected, lazy as, but it was cool to finally see them in the flesh. The real highlight for me was the golden monkeys which were being trained by a keeper when we were there. Their little blue faces are such a delight. We didn't see much else as the queues were huge and we had limited time but worth visiting for the Pandas and I will definitely go back for a longer visit to see some of the other animals and go on the rides"

Only my eldest daughter was allowed to go on all the rides due to height restrictions. My 2 youngest children were not allowed to really go on anything. Saw the carousel and got excited that they could finally go on a ride but when we got closer realised it was closed. Shows are a little lack lustre if compared to other theme parks world wide and for an English speaking family only the main dolphin show was translated. Although, in writing on the screen, not really helpful for young kids who can't read. Visited on a hot day and as stated in previous reviews there is little shade and a lot of walking between attractions. As a comparison Disneyland lines are mostly in sheltered/ air conditioned areas making it much more comfortable. There is a McDonald's in the park which was surprising to see but offered a cheaper alternative for lunch. The park setting itself is quite nice on a hill with good views from the rides over the neighbouring towns. My children liked seeing the giant pandas, which is probably the major draw card here. For Australians who have been to dreamworld on the Gold Coast they have the rapids ride and the log ride here which are exactly the same. It is a relief to get a bit wet on a hot day, although again strict height restrictions. Still had an enjoyable day even though we were all hot and exhausted from walking so far."

I don't think one day is good enough to cover all the attractions, it is spread over a large area... Even with cloud cover the place was too hot and humid, be prepared...

This is clearly a nice park, with good intentions and goals as well as direct personnel (but NOT good MTR sales departments), but if you go on a windy day, this should serve as a warning: all the 'mechanical outdoor rides' will be closed, even the Ocean Park lookout tower and the raft attraction (which was clearly not affected by the wind). So check the weather forecasts, although you're never sure: when we were there, they already closed way before the strong winds. Especially if you buy your tickets at the MTR station Admiralty, where they give you a discount, they will not tell you that all the rides are actually closed (even though they were already closed at the moment we bought the ticket). So don't let them mislead you here, ask if all the rides will be open, because the fact that they don't provide accurate info is 'not Ocean Park's responsibility' (which seems slack management to us, they should keep their offices selling their tickets in check)."

But we realized we were wrong. They enjoyed it very much. Ocean Park is an amusement park where we could go there with our whole family.The kids watched the dolphin show, and saw real sea lions and dolphins. Ocean Park is humongous. We thought that it would be tiring to walk from one zone to another. But really, there were shuttle buses and escalators, and it took just a few steps to continue walking.The place was so clean and there were cute decorations. I enjoyed all the roller coasters especially the \u201cHair Dryer\u201d. If you go to Hongkong , I think this would be the first thing you should think"

It desperately needs to be modernized. My kids aged 11 and 13 love roller coasters but the ones at ocean park were just not exciting. Universal studios in Singapore is much much better. If you have been to amusement parks in the U.S. Or even Australia, you will be bored to tears here!!!!

Didn't have time to see the Pandas or any of the shows. 2 tips - at 4.30 pm it totally emptied out. You could do all rides with no waiting. So maybe do the shows, aquarium, pandas etc first and the rides last (that's what I will do if we ever visit again!) and secondly buy your tickets to the park at Admiralty station, just before you exit at Exit B. They sell discounted tickets and there are no queues. We all had a fantastic day. Oh it also seemed way hotter there at Ocean Park. Take hats and suncream."

The water rides were fun but there are only a few, they are VERY short and you don't really get very wet. With all that space those rides could be double the size. The day we went wasn't that busy but the queues were still rather long. Either way, if you decide to go don't set on spending the whole day. Just go and play it by ear. The Aquarium was interesting but full of Mainlanders who are definately not as well versed in manners. We were pushed and shoved and it was chaos inside there.

As the title says, just marvelous and caters to all ages.The queues are quite big for some of the rides but that's due to how popular it is and there's also a few Pandas there which I wasn't expecting but so glad I was that close to them!"

There were no queues when we were here so it was easy to hop on and off rides many times but looking at the queuing systems it may be different on weekends or holidays!!! The animals are interesting, big aquarium and pandas. But the rides are super fun!!! Lots of big roller coasters for the big kids and a whole little park for the smaller kids!! Everybody loved it!!Only slight down side was the dreadful food - just over salted sugar loaded rubbish. We would come back here again and again!!"

The park is too vast to see try every ride and see every aquatic specie they had. We get to see the Grand Aquarium first since its in the lower part, many fishes, different species. Then went to polar adventure to see the penguins and the seals, then to the sharks. The park's too big so we didn't manage to see every attraction, we also didn't ride any. But oh, don't forget to ride the train and the cable car. It's one of a kind experience. You get to see the Ocean park, bird's eye view. Oh! Oh! Don't forget to stay until closing time, there's Symbio, the parks closing attraction. Its a dancing fountain that tells story about water and fire dragon and the balance of nature."

The show was a blast because it also discusses issues regarding preservation of our flora and fauna.Don't forget to bring extra shirt or jacket especially because the place is way big and you may sweat a lot.

I took MTR to the Admiralty station and a public bus no.629 to the entrance of the ocean park. There were a lot of visitors queuing to enter the theme park. Once entering the theme park, I went to the summit by the Ocean Express as the cable car was under maintenance. When I reach the summit there were no queue requires at all rides. The rides were old and no fun at all. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS SINGAPORE WAS WAY MUCH BETTER THAN OCEAN PARK. The tickets price was expensive and not worth at all. Around 12:00, there are more visitors coming up to the summit but SURPRISINGLY THERE WAS NO WAIT REQUIRES AT ALL. They were mostly senior citizen and they were just walking around the theme park rather than riding the rides. The whole parks were crowded with visitors but no wait requires as well. I got to ride all the rides at the time around 2:30 at the afternoon so I make the exit of the park and I went into the store to get some souvenirs. The souvenirs were not attractive at all. All in all the whole day in the theme park was not really good because the rides are kind of out-dated and boring. The food inside was quite expensive compared to the food outside the theme park and not tasty."

The park is accessible by bus and taxi via Aberdeen and tunnel to the other side of the mountains surrounding the harbor. The park entrance area is similar to a visit to Universal Studios / Disney. There are many hotels and souvenir shops in the ticketing area. On entry to the park you will see many interesting exhibitions and the equivalent of a small zoo with the main theme based on Pandas living in what is created to represent their natural living environment. There are some classic rides there for the kids including a carousel. When you progress onward to the main attractions you can choose to go by skyway (scenic chairlift) or by train (through the mountain itself). It is one entrance fee covers all, if you want you can return and try both ! We did try both and preference was for the skyway. Travelling over 3 peaks to our destination which I can only describe as breathtaking, to a multi-level amusement park that was built into a hillside going down to the harbor exterior with nice views. Travel between levels is by outdoor escalators. Every level contains different themes and all sorts of amusement rides and sights to see. Top level there are big american style rides for thrill seekers, down to the bottom levels where you will find a Roller-coaster and some Water rides / Flumes. We really enjoy our visit here and all I can say is that a whole day is probably how long it will take to get round. It merits a second visit to go and experience the rides. Very good attraction. We will go back there again soon."

However, sometimes the bus station are full of people and you will have to queue for a long time before boarding a bus. A much faster and cheaper way is to take any bus that pass through the Aberdeen Tunnel. So just look for buses in Central, Wanchai or Causeway Bay that goes to the Southern side of Hong Kong Island through the Aberdeen Tunnel. Examples are bus no. 70, 90 and 590 departing from the bus terminal in Exchange Square Central. No. 590 is the first choice because it is a express route.Get off at the Aberdeen Tunnel Toll Plaza, the first stop after passing the tunnel. There is a sign in the bus station showing you how to walk to Ocean Park. It takes around 10 minutes to reach the Park Entrance.Ocean Park is a great place. Enjoy the visit."

We also loved the aquarium and the pandas. When we left we realised we had missed an entire section of the park.... That's how big it is!!! We noticed that as we were leaving at about 3' massive coach loads of people were arriving, tour groups from the mainland. So the morning was a much better option. The food was ok but expensive, they check your bags on entry so you have to buy food inside. It was very hour and humid, so we got through a lot of bottled water.

            "review": "How to plan your trip there. Having visited Ocean Park the second time I can say its a decent place to spend an entire day. Before going there you need to plan how you want to spend your day and whats more important \"the rides\" or the animals\" or \"the shows\" to you cause you will not finish all the rides and see all the shows in one day.. So here is some tips how to plan the day. I wont bother how you get there that is easy to figure out.# Avoid weekends and holidays if possible, the park will be most crowded and that would mean longer wait on rides.# Book your tickets in advance, if you do not want to wait in line for tickets as well.# If you have the choice also check the weather, if its rainy some of the rides will not be open.# Wear comfortable clothes and footwear especially since you will be doing a lot of walking.# carry sun block and umbrella for heat and rain (if you want to carry things around) # Get to the Park a little before it opens, you may have to wait to enter but that way you have time to click pictures outside. While your waiting you can pick a copy of the map and the show timings from outside.# You can download a map online and plan your route though the park, it will save a lot of time then standing there and figuring out, anyways you will be waiting in line for each ride.# Its ok to carry you bag / cameras etc, they do have lockers at the entrance which you can rent out, can carry your camera with you most rides have places to store your things just before the ride# If you are carrying your bag make sure its not too heavy, you don't want to be lugging things around# First thing to do after you enter is to decide if you want to take the train or the sky cable car to the top, the train is quick and the cable car is more scenic (takes longer though) but I recommend taking it at the beginning of the day on the way up.. usually the evenings the wait to get on the cable car is lot longer and you will be too tired to enjoy it then.# Study the rides that you want to take and go straight for them, recommendation would be do any many rides before lunch and post lunch do the animal visits and shows (unless you are not interested in rides of course)# Recommended rides if your up to the turning upside down type of things.. in order of my preference.. Most scary n fun downwards1. Hair Raiser (The best ride of the park)2. The Flash3. Ragging River (can carry a rain coat or covering but if you don't get wet what's the fun)4. Mine Train5. The Rapids (get wet for God's sake)6. Whirly Bird / The Abyss / Eagle (all similar feel)7. The dragon (I found it too bumpy a ride) For the shows please do catch the dolphins at the ocean theatre, avoid going for the last show since the animals would be tired having done the same things so many times before in the day.# For food would suggest eating light and quick so that you can enjoy most of the rides.#overall tip - do most of the scary rides before lunch and the lighter ones after.. but also try and cover area wise rides so you not wasting too much time getting from one ride to another since it is a big park to walk around.. # Also some rides maybe cancelled or open later for maintenance so you may have to re-plan on the spot quickly."

It has all sorts of animals on exhibition, from Pandas, to sharks to alligators. If you are more into the rides you can take the cable car ride to the second half of the park, giving you a great view of Hong Kong's rural aspect. On the second half of the park you will find some absolutely brilliant rides, such as the the Abyss or the Mine Train."

Ocean Park is a MUST for both tourists and residents and definitely to be preferred over Hong Kong Disneyland.Planning is the key to enjoying your day out. Get to the gate 15 minutes before the park opens and head to the far right of the line of entry turnstiles. There you will find the information or services centre. Get a free map of the park and find out the times of shows (or check these out online before your visit). When you enter the park proper, head first to the Grand Aquarium, which is stunning. Queues for this build up rapidly, so best to kick your visit off here. Then take the Ocean Express to the Summit and enjoy the attractions there, before taking a relaxing cable car ride back to the Headland. This way you will avoid many of the queues you would otherwise encounter, particularly at the cable car. Of course, if 'rides' are your thing, then you will head directly to the Summit!Toilets are plentiful and generally regularly cleaned at OP. There are some drinking water fountains so it is a good idea to take your own water bottle with you and replenish for free. F & B is expensive at OP, but then all profits go to the Ocean Park Conservation Fund, OP being a non-profit organisation. You can of course take your own picnic with you to save money."

The rides are pretty limited and the park gets very crowded (and adults are very aggressive pushing in front of kids). Also they close quite early, around 6 or 7, so that means you can't go later when it is cooler and less crowded."

In the end we chose Ocean Park as it was cheaper and - most importantly - it had pandas. It's easy to get to on public transport. It's a beautifully laid-out park, built on two levels of a mountain so the views are spectacular. The rides are fun, the animals are better and the pandas were incredible - it was the first time we had seen pandas in real life, and they were beautiful. We spent almost an hour watching them eating their dinner. Great day."

The big thrill rides are all at the top level of the park , go early when it opens, go straight to the cable car , go up to the rides and you won't have to queue. Do not go on the weekend where you will battle the local and mainland tourists busy and noisy ! Buses go direct and plenty of taxis. It has changed a lot , for the better in 20 years !

It was not as crowded as expected on a Saturday. I like \"the Dragon\" roller coaster, it is thrilling and exciting. Although food and drinks there are expensive, it is around the same as other famous theme parks, and some beverages costs less. The ticket price is reasonable for the variety of attractions is ocean park. However, transportation is not very convenient as the MTR station is still under construction. One way to get there is taking CityBus 629 from admiralty station (Exit b). In a nutshell, Ocean park is enjoyable for teens and adults, I would definitely recommend them to my friends."

They do some amazing stunts which I will leave for you to find out for yourself.Pack your own food if you plan to beat the insanely high prices of the food there. One restaurant has a plate of rice with two types of meat at HKD155.All in all, good for a one-time visit as part of your tour of HK as there will be many areas inside where you can take memorable photos. - dp"

We visited the place instead of Disneyland because people said that it would become a pearl in our visit to HK.We bought the tickets from klook.com which offer tickets at a marginal discount.The park is divided into two sections and they can be accessed by a tram or a train. I reccommend people to prefer the train as you can reach the other side quicker as the tram takes a lot of time and the waiting time has a minimum of an hour.The rides are wonderful and adrenaline-packed. I, being an Indian-vegetarian expected no Indian food in the park. But Lo! There was an Indian Vegetarian meal available (Rotis, Sabji and Rice). The only request I would make to the park authorities is to stop the sale of squids as the smell really engulfs the place and induces a vomiting sensation. I even found a few Westerners with their children who came out of the queues in the rides because the quid really emitted a very bad smell. Being called 'Ocean Park',it should be aiming at conserving marine life rather than selling it.Overall, the expreience was very nice and almost all the rides are suitable for families with young children.So, rush out there families, a pearl in HK's crown awaits you!!"

One full day may nt be enough to cover the whole park, given the really long queues for most rides. I went twice and couldn't cover every single ride. If u only have one day there, then play smart and be selective. Food there is overly priced, but u can't really bring food into the park. Overall, worth the money! Have fun!"

Many attractions was using air conditioner with very low temperature, so that the temperature difference outside and inside was quite disturbing. There was no drinking water fountain in there, you must prepare a lot of money to buy bottled water which rather expensive, including the food. Attractions itself was good enough. Better if you visited the park on Autumn or Spring season."

We got a discounted ticket ( I guess ) for 310HKD. If I'm not mistaken the regular price is 360HKD. We bought the ticket along the subway in Central. it's good to experience marine life for a short time, perfect for kids. Extreme rides? I give them two thumbs up. Not to mention the bad catch is the long queue and the hot weather. Better bring water because\u00a0it double it's price when you get inside. Have fun!"

You get to play small games which are pretty good (ofcourse they are paid). Get a glimps of old HK made as an attraction. The best thing to do is riding Hair Raiser!!! If you can ride this than do not miss any chance, get some adrenaline rush. A tip for Hair Raiser, go in the evening after 6 as during day time there so much rush for this ride."

Amazing park and one of the best I've ever been to, as it is a great mix of theme park/aquarium/zoo, with multiple different zones and animals to engage everybody's interests, no matter what age!Disappointingly, the pandas were sleeping when I was there (which was to be expected, I suppose) but the aquariums were impressive, modern and informative and there was a large selection of sea life on show.Queue times for the more popular rides and attractions ranged between 45mins-1hr and rides ranged from those suitable for little children through to thrill-seeking adults.Lots of food and restaurant options were available too and a choice of cable-car or the express train, to get from the bottom zones all the way to the upper-level zones and attractions. A particular highlight for me was watching one of the regularly-scheduled dolphin and sea lion live shows with their trainers and just wandering around the 'rainforest' area and aquariums in general.A great day out for the family or with friends, it offers the perfect getaway from the bustling city."

I was expecting the place to be packed but, whilst busy, we didn't have to queue for rides for too long. There's also a good mix of rides and animal attractions, which helps to break the day up. The setting is spectacular, high up on the coastline. The cable car, and some of the roller coasters are almost worth the entrance fee themselves. The only slight downside to the day in the fairground area was when my son had a go at kicking a football through the hole. The big cuddly toys were all hanging up on display, so you can imagine his delight when he scored. Unfortunately, the attendant went to the side of the stall and presented him with a pink pig that could sit on the palm of your hand. We took this as an affront and handed it back saying he didn't want it, and after a couple of supervisors later she agreed to swap it for a more acceptable toy from one of the other stalls. Simple really. Of course there are souvenir shops on the way out of every single attraction, and you'll have had your picture taken a dozen times with park reps trying to sell you copies at $190, but it's your choice. At the end of the day, there's a spectacular show of water jets, music, flames and fireworks. I'd definitely recommend this park for children or all ages, and I'd say it was good value in comparison to other amusement parks and zoos that I have been to."

Not a gust of wind in sight so we still decided to go to ocean park during a typhoon warning.When we got there, all rides apart from the cable car were shut. Then gradually throughout the day, everything was closing including the dolphin show. The day quickly turned into a day to the zoo which wasn't too bad but it was still very disappointing. We mannaged to see the dolphin show before it shut. I'm not one to watch these types of shows due to the animals being in tiny swimming pools but they were very good at promoting sustainable fishing and teaching children about littering and not eating endangered animals like shark fin soup. I saw the potential for a fun day out so if i'm ever back in Hong Kong when it's not typhoon season i may go back"

We ended up having to cancel dinner with friends because of the ridiculous long wait Lack of entertainment - only some hopeless shows and nothing like the likes of what the bigger names would offer Stroller parking is not at the exit, after exiting an attraction you need to walk back to the entrance to collect your stroller (ie the shark place - have to walk back up the hill just to collect stroller!!!)Unfriendly staff - understand this because there were too many people around but no effort to make the visit memorableOverall just a very average park, nothing much to shout about.

There are red panda's as well as the Giant Panda and the staff were really full of information to help you get as much out of the trip as possible.Really loved the shark exhibition and it's aquarium and the views all over the park were amazing. Very well managed and everything is free (apart from food) so great value.Finished off by an amazing cable car ride down the mountain.

Start from Grand Aquarium zone then you can walk future to the zoo zone and you can go further to other zone by using the theme park express which is the rail connect to Playground zone which there're many entertainment machines. But the queue to play each machine is really long. You may need to be very patient. With the crowd of people and limited seating inside the theme park including less area with cover. I'd recommend to bring the sun glasses, sun block, hats or umbrella as during summer the sunlight may really hurt the skin.On the way back, you can either take cable car back to the main station or take the theme park express. There're few shows available in each section. If you are interested to see the show like dolphins show, I'd recommend to go before schedule.There're few restaurants in theme park but quite pricy for example one noodle soup outside may cost you $HK40-50 but in there will charge you more than $HK165 even the price also include one drink and ice cream. But if you buy burger at Mc Donald shall cost you $HK20-30 only. The water inside charge you $HK24 whereas outside charge $HK7. But there's some area provide the water but you need to bring the bottle to take it.The finale show is the fountain show at 8 pm. You can stay on to see the show or if you would like to avoid the crowd I would recommend to leave in the evening time.On the way back you can just take bus no 629 same as arrival time and drop off at MTR - admiralty."

The do the most popular rides (such as the Hair Raiser, Raging Rapids and log flume). At midday cool down from the heat by doing the Polar and Antarctic displays (you can essentially just walk into these without queuing). If you want to see the Ocean Wonders (dolphin and seal acrobatics) show I would recommend arriving at the Ocean Theatre 20 mins before the showtime as this tends to fill up. But most importantly, buy your tickets in advance (online or at the bus terminal) for a cheaper price and to avoid the entrance ticket queues. If you leave when the park closes (7pm Mon-Fri, 9pm weekends) you will have a long queue for the bus or taxi, so either leave earlier or order a taxi. Have a great day!"

Different shows will be played on at different time. Visitors can get a map at the entrance.Before you go there, you'd better get a ticket online so that you don't have to wait in line. I also advise that visit the Ocean Park in the morning. It deserves us to spend the whole day in it. Be sure that visit the Summit in the morning by free cable car in the park, visit the Waterfront in the afternoon by train. Yes, the transportation in the park is free!!!

I went there in march, I didn't queue for more than 20-25mins on anything. It is true it is lacking of rest areas, the few ones available are taken immediately... And the \"animal\" part is lacking a little bit of animals for my taste.Other than that, if you manage to find a day where the pack is not crowded it really is worth a visit."

If you're choosing between Disneyland and Ocean Park I'd tell you that there are other Disney Parks but just the one Ocean Park. My one day experience at the park was enough, but it was a worthy day trip and a real bargain for what you get.The upsides were great views of Hong Kong and the ocean from many spots of the park, lots of attractions and rides, its affordable, and you can pretty much find something for anyone to enjoy. Though there are some potential cons if you are lazy and didn't plan well (like me) you may find yourself waiting in a very long and hot queue to get in. Just buy a ticket online or get there early to avoid the massive lines. Also use your octopus card to get onto the bus to avoid another line buying tickets to get on the bus. Once at the park, you also might find some of the rides and rollercoasters small and slower compared to other bigger parks, but lines can get long for these as well so I would recommend doing all of those things first as we were able to get into some rides with no queueing due to prioritizing time. The biggest downside (which is probably a case for all theme parks) is inevitability at some time in the day you'll have to wait in some long line for something. The visitors were mostly local people or tourists from nearby asian countries, but if you only speak English you'll still find its no problem to get around. Just remember it gets super hot in the summer and if you don't remember to put some sun protection on you might end up a bit burnt at the end of the day, so also take breaks throughout the day from the rides to go into some of the cooler air conditioned animal exhibits. The jellyfish one is especially cool."

Most attractions had lifts or different routes in so you could avoid the stairs and escalators. Only thing to watch out for are Mainland Chinese people who seem to think that they can just push themselves to the front and are not very patient at queing.Food choices were excellent and good value for money.

The park is divided into the Waterfront (mainly kid rides and and the Summit (where the main thrill rides are). As soon as the park opens watch out for the big rush of people running to the cable cars to get to the summit. We bypassed it by catching the less scenic but faster Ocean Express to beat the queue. Hair Riser was definitely a must-try, being on the side of the hill adds a new level of excitement!Unfortunately when we went, both The Dragon and Mine Train roller coasters were closed for works. The visit was still great. The panda and aquarium were both good visits too. Great prizes for the carnival games as we won a couple of Sesame street plushes.Average queue times were around 30min on the Monday when we went. As we went in September, they park was getting ready for Halloween however the Halloween-specific attractions were not open then. They look like great attractions too.Wider selection of food compared to most theme parks."

Two adults with three kids aged 10 and 11, going on a very hot Sunny afternoon for our afternoon of fun on our last weekend here. This is my inner child's favourite place to have fun in Hong Kong as she was here for the first time back in 1980 and what fond memories she has of her first visit! HeheBring lots of water and snacks because the food and drinks here cost as expected for a theme park, an arm and a leg! We headed up to the top of the park by cable car and the view was just breathtaking yet coming back down was so much more rewarding as it was getting dark and the lights came on! So the cable car ride is a must to get the views of Hong Kong that we can never get elsewhere! This attraction is very educational for kids as well as adults about animals and mammals. Go inside to see the penguins and all the sealife to escape from the intense Hong Kong heat and you will get your socks blown off! hahaI was still recovering from whiplash symptoms so I needed to stay off the roller coaster rides yet I still had the time of my life here as I was the biggest kid there! hehe I went onto The Rapids three times just to stay cool and what fun it was each time to get water on me! There is an area undercover for those who want to get wet and bring a change of clothes so you can have a whale of a time! This is the best opportunity to stay out of the intense heat and be the biggest kid ever! heheThe queuing times on this particular busy Sunday for popular rides was an hour or slightly over so an afternoon was never going to be enough yet we made the most of what time we did have. Be very aware that the rude mainland China people will and do skip the queues, push through you as well as walking straight up to the front of the queues! I never allowed this to bother me as I was having the time of my life yet some people will stand up to them, for me, nothing much gets done about this as I had witnessed at Disneyland. There's definitely less pressure to buy souvenirs from here compared to Disneyland so we spent less money here. Yet the photos that can be purchased from the cable car ride and other rides were well worth the memory of the moment! hehe Do make the most of your visit and be the biggest kid ever!"

Our son was almost 6 at the time and he could only go on the babiest of rides even though he had been on much more adventurous rides elsewhere. The rides for the adults were super tame. I was expecting much more. Positive they did have some wonderful acrobatic shows, the best part of the park was the cable car to the entrance.Save your money and go to HK Disney if you are looking for fun and rides."

The new Pandas are not available because a lucky lady in there got pregnant. A nice trick to avoid the cable car queues up to the hilltop is to take the express train. And a trick is to bring a stroller or rent one at the park so your whole family can go to the express line without queueing. This way you can take cable car down from the hill. And you can do it two times before it's your friend's turn at the bottom of the hill! A must visit place is those game stalls in the children's park, almost nobody there and as long as you are willing to pay, the kids will sure carry a few plush toys home! The Aquarium is a disappointment comparing to the SEA Aquarium in Singapore. The terrace restaurant at the hilltop is a must visit, but make sure you arrive there before noon time to get a nice seat with photo spots for the entire south of the hk island (some liken it to the French Rivera) and the cable cars view. Also, why can they offer online ticketing?"

            "review": "Surpassing all expectations -- action-packed, ambitious rides. We headed to Ocean Park on a hot, sunny day in Hong Kong, raring to go on real rides this time and not the Toy Story hand-holdy practical jokes HK Disneyland has the audacity to call rides. We were not disappointed. Thrill Mountain is above and beyond the best region of the park to head to if you're in the mood to have your bum kicked by seriously spine-tingling roller-coasters. Even if you're not into heavy-duty coasters, Ocean Park has a lot on offer, like animal shows, dolphin encounters, exhibitions and more tame rides for the kids. Apart from its rides, the park's ultimate selling point is its location. High up on a mountain for which you need to take a bus from Admiralty to access, the park offers stunning views of the landscape from the peak of one of Hong Kong's shapely land structures. The sea and the sky complement each other beautifully, and from a coaster it's even more fun to admire the natural beauty that surrounds the bustling city.Tips: to get there, you have to take the Metro to Admiralty, from where a bus will take you across Hong Kong Island to Ocean Park. At the Admiralty Metro station, stop by the Ocean Park ticket booth near the exit of the station for a discount. Buy water from the vendor near the bus stop; it's cheaper. Wear walking shoes that are unlikely to fall off your feet when on a coaster (though if you wear sandals there is storage for each ride). Don't carry too many bags. Bring an umbrella as it may drizzle. And for god's sake, wear sunscreen! The rides that we did, in order:1) Hair-Raiser. On Thrill Mountain, for which you ride a cable car to reach. A relentless roller coaster that immediately takes you through three swooping loops through the air, defying gravity and thwarting all hopes of escape. 45 seconds of pure adrenaline and heart-stopping terror. Long queue: 45 minutes for 45 seconds.2) The Rapids. At the Rainforest. Get ready to get wet! You'll be plopped onto a boat that seats 9 people in total. You'll be taken on a tropical adventure that involves sailing along an automated approximation of a river. While the path to the finish does not involve any jumps or scares, the folks at Ocean Park know how to keep us on our toes: intermittently we are doused with water from nearby fountains. Quite fun. Bathrooms are located nearby for you to freshen up, and the water does tend to dry up quickly in the Hong Kong heat. Raincoats can be purchased before the ride. Quick queue. 3) Raging River: a water slide with a Canadian theme. The Chinese do love their Canada memorabilia; I think it's aspirational. Anyway. Tear your gaze away from the Maple Leaf motifs adorning the First Nation canoe you step into and embrace the sprays of water that drench you during an exhilarating 10-second drop into a large puddle. Like riding a water slide, but shorter and scarier. If you're in the middle of the 4-seater you'll get less wet. Plus you get a picture of your screaming as a souvenir if you choose to buy it. Very long queue for us. 35 minutes. Not so fun as the other two. 4) Mine Train. Not on Thrill Mountain but at the same place as Raging River, wherever that is. Very fun ride -- an electrifying roller-coaster like Hair Raiser. Outstanding view of Hong Kong from the mountain peak. I'd do the ride again just for the views of the surrounding mountains and sea! Very fast-moving queue: 20 minutes. Good ride.5) The Flash -- far and away the most thrilling ride I have ever taken. Better than Hair Raiser. Up on Thrill Mountain. The seating car goes up into the air and performs a 360 degree turn so that you can appreciate the stunning view of the South China Sea from upside-down. That was like fulfilling a dream I didn't even know I had. Not a ride: a spiritual experience. Not for the faint of heart, or for children under 12. Take a good look at it before going!5 minute queue, probably because I did it shortly before closing -- a good time to catch any ride.6) Bumper Car -- not sure if this is the official name, though it is on Thrill Mountain and involves sitting in a car that goes up and down on a loop. Reminiscent of a Luna Park rollercoaster. More tame than the others but still nice and scary. Brace yourselves! Short queue, 5 minutes as we were nearing closing time. The rhythmic motion of the ride was a welcome change from the crazy twists and turns of the Flash.We had lunch at the terrace cafe. Quick and courteous service, decent food -- I recommend the club sandwich. Avoid the pizzas: they are much smaller than they appear on the menu. The Caesar salad was not much to speak of.We had a caricature portrait done by Paul, the sitting cartoonist. I didn't think much of it.To catch the cable car back from Thrill Mountain you'll have to do a fair amount of walking, so prepare yourself for that -- don't get too tired, now! We arrived at noon and went home happy and satisfied around 7pm. A great day!"

Crowds are also part of the norm and bus loads of tourists from the mainland take queue jumping to a new level (Note: everyone feels the heat in summer and starts to try and cut corners!). It's well organised and the staff are all relaxed and friendly. Make sure you do your research before you arrive if you want to see any of the shows. Unlike DL Ocean Park has some attractions that have a broader age span but it seems to be aimed at impressing tourists from the mainland rather than impress on an International standing but it's the best HK has to offer. Young kids should take their swimming kit so they can enjoy the 'wet area'. You may like to consider taking your own snacks and drinks or eating afterwards as the fast food is not for me......"

On a positive note, there are plenty of buses to take you from Admiralty MTR to and from the park if using public transport, and it looks like there will be a MTR opposite the park completed some time in the near future as construction was well under way!If your kids are under 8 years of age, I think your best to take them to Disneyland.

The cable car offering a stunning ocean view continues to be the main attraction but if you like rides I counted at least 10 of them including roller coaster, tower drop, ferry wheels, lazy river, water splash, etc. The mega aquarium and shark exhibits are state of the art and not to be missed. There are many other animal exhibits so it depends on what is your interest. Suggest visiting the Pandas as soon as the park opens at 10 am, that\u2019s when they are fed and usually more active. Large groups of tourist and students are inevitable but even so the queue time was bearable at say some 15-20min depending on the attraction. We bought tickets at 10% discount from some deal websites."

They're always adding new games so there's always something new to expect. The waiting lines in ocean park, unfortunately is longer with some games like the water adventure where you have to wait for more than an hour. There's lots of waiting and walking to do so a comfortable shoes would be good-better still if you get a shoes with rollers below ;). You can get the gandola on your way up and get the express train on your way down. There are also panda conservation, Hk cultural and history shows etc which adds a different charm to it just being synonymous to thrilling games."

There is not enough time in 1 day to enjoy everything fully if you want to do rides and see animals. Food is expensive and not allowed to bring from outside (however if you have a backpack you can easy smuggle some food in) There are drinking fountains so bring a bottle for refill. Or buy a cool one from the souvenir shop :)The park is very big so prepare for lots of walking. Some attractions have lines, sometimes you need to que for and hour or more. Try to go on non crowded days or else you won't be able to do many attrations.Pandas are cute! but visit their pen when there is still daylight if you want to take pictures."

The pandas are given mounds of bamboo to enjoy, and lumps of ice to laze on when things get warm. The aquariums are really something special. Then take a ride in the train through the mountain or take a gondola over the top, which is breath-taking and a bit frightening. The rides are great fun, but some of them look like they need a bit of attention. The food options are vast, and for the non-locals, eye-opening. Don't be afraid of the grilled squid in a bag, it's quite delicious."

Wear comfortable, sun friendly, cool clothing, take your sunscreen, hat or umbrella as the sun can be very hot. Especially whilst waiting in line for attractions such as the Log Ride. Please also note that many attractions are up hills, or down steep slopes. Please wear closed in comfortable walking shoes ! There is a fantastic cable car ride to many of the higher attractions. I recommend you take this from \"Old Chinatown\" near the entrance after viewing the Panda enclosure. Then when you have finished seeing all the rides and shows at the top, take the Ocean Express train back down ! A fascinating experience rather like being in a submarine.... as you travel through the mountain. Kids of all ages are catered for with a large range of rides to suit. Make sure to take plenty of water as it can be very expensive to buy once inside. If you are staying in Kowloon, get the ferry across to Central from Star Ferries at Tsim Sha Sui. Thanks to Citybus's Ocean Park Express bus service (Route 629), you can get there fairly easily in under 25 minutes. You can get on the Ocean Park Express from Central just outside the Star Ferry terminal on the Hong Kong Island side or from Admiralty (West) Bus Terminal just outside the Admiralty MTR Station. But beware !!!! If you decide to get the bus from Admiralty, it will most likely be full already from passengers embarking at Central. There are LONG LONG queues at Admiralty Station. The cost is (as at July2015) $10.90HK for Adults and $5.90HK for children. The drivers are usually fairly lax in making sure you have the exact change as you simply pop it into a box, so most times they just say $10 and $5 to make is simpler. We were 2 adults and 2 children and the drivers we encountered for all our public bus trips around HK Island rounded down for us each time. It is then simply a case of catching the same bus outside Ocean Park for the trip back to the ferry pier. Make sure you plan your day with enough time to get to the bus early - the first one leaves Star Ferry Pier at 0915am and they go every half hour. Ocean Park opens at 1000am and it is very much recommended that you pre buy your tickets either with your tour desk at the hotel or online. The queues for tickets once you arrive are huge ! Also please make sure no alcohol or prepackaged food from outside fast food retailers is in your bags as it will be confiscated at the compulsory bag search on entry. Something that is often missed on a trip to Ocean Park is the Mammal breeding centre - GO TAKE THE TIME TO HAVE A LOOK !!!! Well worth the walk. Also the Jellyfish spectacular is a bit tricky to find, but well worth the effort. The dolphin show is also very good, but get there for a seat early !!! Seats over 2thousand people..... HAVE FUN :)"

The easiest way to get to Ocean Park is to take the MTR to Admiralty and then follow the directions to Exit B which takes you to the Ocean Park Bus Stop. Here you can board the 629 bus which goes directly to Ocean Park and takes about 15 minutes.Once you arrive you can purchase your ticket if you have not done so already online. The ticket price is a little costly, although covers the cost of all the attractions inside apart from food and drink - so make the most of it - you can easily spend the whole day there. The entrance to the theme park takes you to a variety of animal enclosures. For each of these it has been very cleverly designed so that as you walk through you always end up in a souvenier shop! You can then either take the cable car or the more recently developed underground train to the other island where there are a few other animal enclosures although mainly this side of the island is the theme park attractions. There are various rides from water rides through to roller coasters. Again throughout there are souvenier shops and restaurants.You will do a lot of walking around here, so ensure you take drinking water with you. At the entrance / exit of the park there is one very large souvenier shop which has all the souvenier's available that you would have seen in the other various shops. I would suggest wait until the end to buy these as otherwise you will be carrying these around with you all day. If you do have bags you are carrying and you want to go on the rides they provide lockers at each ride that you can leave your bag in and then pick them up when you finish your ride which is also helpful.A great day out for the family although be prepared to spend money there!"

Take panoramic views from the tower and eagle ride. Go take the escalator down for the water ride (won't get much wet though) and another roller coaster . The dolphin show can be squeezed in to relax and take a breather from the thrill rides. Do the rides multiple times and you would enjoy them."

The attractions are spread openly into two areas; lower section and higher section. For the higher section, you will need to take the free cable car ride or the ocean express. As the area is huge and most portion have to be covered by foot, it can be daunting especially during the hot summer period. The rides are worth the try and queue time is not as long as the ones in Disneyland or Universal Studios. In addition, you will also get to see penguin, walrus, sharks, seals and sea lions. Recommended for family with children."

Little kids with stroller are given preferred Q in some areas like ocean express. Good rides within the park.Areas that need to be improved in my opinion : -1) the information map and introduction flyers does not indicate the highlights of the park. Example \"must see\" or \"most popular\". That can save alot of problems for visitors who have only half day to spare in the park. In addition, for first timers, the park is split into 2 parts and only connected with cable car or the LRT (ocean express). But it has not clearly indicating this way. So indication of highlights become more important.2) Short marine live shows involving dolphins and sea lions only. Overall including others like animals from down under were limited, the shows or exhibits areas are touching on the surface.3) Several Steep slopes on one side of the park. A real challenge to the takecarer pushing stroller or wheelchair up slope."

Expensive food but there is a McDonald inside the park! So great to see where they trained the Dolphins, a few of them came and basically stopped in front of us for quite a while, I guess they were waiting for food from their trainers, we were really lucky to have them right smack in front of us so that was really cool! Had a very good view of the panda who was so relax while enjoying his feast! Love the goldfish areas! Didn't like cable car as I don't fancy going for anything high but I survived the ride which comes with the magnificent view! Was able to see Aberdeen from the other part of the park as well. The Q for taxi was crazy and they were hardly any taxi so we gave up and just started walking for quite a while and caught the bus thereafter to get to Jumbo floating restaurant which is located not too far away from the park."

Also be ready to spend 5-10 mins in queues for every ride but it is worth it.My biggest ever recommendation: Go For IT...."

Extremely huge so you must plan well and as there arent very many information centres positioned all over you wont be able to get appropriate directions and will be going around in circles. Not all the staff speak english so asking for directions would be pointless. Make sure you get there by 10am in the morning as it starts getting crowded past noon. Buy your tickets online through klook to avoid waiting in line at the box office at the park and to get a better price. As soon as you arrive my advice is take the cable car and go to the summit first and do all the rides and visit the north pole and south pole exhibits first. Then walk down towards the ocean express train and go to the rainforest section before you get into the train to head down towards the aquarium. A must visit is the giant panda and the aquarium is beautiful as well. The most enjoyable for my toddlers was the north pole and south pole being able to view the walruses seals and penguins at such close proximity and of course the giant panda. The rides are for more of a older age group and i wish there was more for children under the age of 4 but defenitely a fantastic time was spent with an entire day practically set out for this visit. Restaurants in the park are expensive as expected so plan a heavy breakfast and ensure you have sufficient water and snacks for the day if you dont intend to eat at the restaurants."

We queued for about an hour to take the cable car ride. It lasted about 10mins and offered a fantastic view of the park and some luxurious houses. Each cable car can sit 6 persons; however the operators are generally very considerate and do not pack it to full capacity. Chances are you get to sit with people you know. My husband and I had a cabin to ourselves. The dolphin show was beautiful, well choreographed with moving music. You'll not stop smiling and be in awe at how ably trained the dolphins are.There are lots of great photo stops and we barely covered the entire grounds in 8 hours with only two very tame rides. I tried my hands at the games stalls and quickly lost HKD50 at the hoops and bottles game. The prizes were very attractive and I was aiming to bring Oscar (my favourite character from Sesame Street) home - it would be a thrill to lug the 3 ft soft toy around in the park, like in the HK dramas but it was fat chance. The hoops bounced like crazy and all I contributed in that 2 min game were the chinks and clinks sounds. Nonetheless it was thoroughly enjoyable. No embarrassment with poor aiming either, I just played and had fun.It was a very hot summer's day, and we were exhausted quickly. Bring a hat and UV umbrella with lots of water if you are visiting during the summer (and medicated oil if you are prone to fainting). I will return again during the cooler climate as I want to explore each attraction more thoroughly. I think it would be even more enjoyable without the heat."

Even after 15 years of taking kids from the stage of toddlers until teenagers, this is still the best place for a day off and family enjoyment.This is Hong Kong's premier home grown theme park attraction, and is better than Disney. Certain times of the year, the park takes on themes eg Christmas and Halloween and the hours are extended into the night.The park has general appeal for all, regardless of age, and whether visiting singly or as part of a group. The site on a headland surrounded by a forest and jutting into the South China Sea is breezy and spectacular.The must-do is the gondola ride which offers panoramic views of the sea and some of HKs most expensive real estate.A MTR underground station link to the park will increase accessibility. Otherwise it's a 10 or 15 minute taxi from Central and Causeway Bay.Tip to avoid queues: start early, head for the other side of the park, and do your visit in reverse. Take the underground train to the other side, do all the roller coaster rides and lunch - the best snack in summer is the mini watermelon. You then take the gondola ride from the back side of the park to the front, avoiding any long queues."

In terms of thrilling rides, if you are an adrenaline junkie, it might be a bit of a downer-we felt only 2 rides were good, The Flash and The Hair Raiser. But if you are with kids, there are plenty of options. The best part though are the sea creatures and animals. Seals, walrus, sharks, penguins, exotic birds, pandas...so many of them in properly planned exhibits. What's more-the aquariums and exhibits are properly labelled when it comes to creature names and information. There are also lovely lessons on how we can help in preserving the environment-so it is great for kids to learn. You must take the cable car ride connecting 2 parts of the park, for the stunning view of the surrounding water body and the park, but be prepared to stand in a queue for a long time. The food options are expensive and the food itself okayish, but there are enough outlets around the park in case hunger strikes. Do not miss the shows at Ocean Theatre where dolphins perform some incredible water stunts.Although it is a little bit far from the city, it is incredibly well connected by city buses. The ways to get there are clearly mentioned in the promotional pamphlet. You can either buy the tickets at park entrance, or get them from any 7 eleven outlet. Make sure to get the park map as soon as you enter, because it is pretty BIG and you need to manage your time. Overall, big fun and great for adults and kids alike."

Here the rollercoasters were waiting for us. The annoying thing is most of the big ones did not open till 11/12. We started to walk towards adventure land and when we got halfway there through the heat there was a sign saying this did not open till 11. I wish they could put a sign up further up the path because it was a long walk !!! When the park fully opened at 12 everything was alive and cooking. The rides were great and the animals were amazing to look at. Would choose ocean park over Disney land as its much bigger and more choice of rides and attractions to see, plus much cheaper.  The grand aquarium is a must see too !! I dropped one star due to the fact most of the rides didn't even start till 11/12, can't see how they can't start at 10 when rest of park opens ?"

To list out some:-staffs carry no smile on the face. not proactive enough even you stand right in front of the counter. No greeting, no hello, no bye, no thank you, nothing. i have a feeling that the staffs might be tired of their jobs and no happy servicing people from \"that certain big country\". i saw a lot of them giving mean faces when the guests spoke to them in Mandarin. -the aquarium's glass was so dirty....that the visibility was so low that day i visited. i didnt even wanna stay there for too long even though i wanted to. the ventilation indoor was bad...-food was very very expensive! bring more money!! a set of meal (noodle/burger/sandwich/pizza) will cost you over HKD100. the meal comes with the main course and a soft drink only... not to miss mentioning, the staffs at the food kiosk have really bad customer service :( SADTips: Make sure you be at the entrance gate before the park opens! if not, you wont be able to get on most of the rides and visit around!"

Long escalator bring you up the hill from entrance. Dolphins and killer whales show is incredible, even for an adult.The bad things about the park, for example, over crowded fish tank, you don't have \"ocean\" feel. Most glass is dirty for display. I think the management does clean it but not frequent enough to catch up stupid visitors who oily fingerprint it again. I will be fair to say the crowded condition reflects what it is like in Hong Kong. If you ever visited any local family household, these animals are considered living in a mansion. It is cruel but true.The worst part comes to over crowded with nasty visitors. I would not name where they come from but they are well known over the world for inappropriate behaviour. I can almost feel the frustration and helplessness from the staff. There were shocking number of stories about nasty visitors complaining staff not being nice and friendly and I don't believe that is fair and represent the overall image of theirs.It is a dilemma, if you have never been Ocean Park. I think it is still worth to give it a go. Stay calm, stay cool. It can be fun visiting Ocean Park if you avoided colliding nasty visitors."

Make sure you are there at flag drop as HK wakes up late and you can easily beat the crowd. Avoid the weekend if you want to fully enjoy the day.

It is slightly further down the park and you can take the Ocean Express or Cable Car to get there. Don't miss the HAIR RAISER - it is definitely one of the best rides.Dolphin shows happen at certain pre-scheduled timings, make sure you know the time so that you don't miss it. Show duration is much less than some other places like Singapore and Bangkok but it was nice.For people who want to see the Panda and other animals - there is a closing time for animals which is much earlier than the rides (7 PM I think) - pls. check with the staff if you don't want to miss it.You can get free vouchers with the entry tickets to enjoy discounts with food and shopping in the park - so make sure you pick them too.

            "review": "Detailed review - Disappointing visit for family with for two young children (& on a rainy day). During our one month stay in Hong Kong, we visited Ocean Park for my son\u2019s 5th birthday (along with our 2 year old daughter) \u2026 and unfortunately left feeling very disappointed. We know that many people with limited time in Hong Kong have to make a choice about whether to visit Ocean Park or Disneyland, and having been to Ocean Park (one day \u2013 a Saturday) and also Hong Kong Disneyland (two days \u2013 a Saturday and Sunday), here are our thoughts based on our experiences with our two young kiddies:\u2022 We purchased our tickets online the day before we went, printed them off, and then beat some of the crowds when we arrived on the day (we arrived 5 minutes prior to opening, and long queues had already formed in the ticket purchase areas).\u2022 We took the #629 Bus from Admirality to Ocean Park \u2013 it was well sign-posted, and came very frequently \u2013 and we could use our Octopus Cards \u2026 extremely easy!\u2022 We found Disneyland to be a far better experience for our young children, and actually for us as parents too: o There were several more rides that our kiddies could do at Disneyland (12 different rides in total, plus the Flights of Fantasy Parade, and the Lion King Show), versus only a handful at Ocean Park (my 2yo could only go on the Carousel and the Merry-Go-Round, and there were only three other rides that my 5yo could go on, being the Arctic Blast, Balloons Up-Up-And-Away, and the Frog Hopper). My 5yo loved the Arctic Blast ride, but found the others quite lame.We did some research prior to going about the height requirements on each of the different rides, and so knew that our kiddies wouldn\u2019t be able to go on any of the rides in \u201cThrill Mountain\u201d, \u201cAdventure Land\u201d or \u201cThe Rainforest\u201d, and we knew that they would not be able to go on five of the six rides in \u201cMarine World\u201d \u2026 our best bet for rides was therefore in \u201cWhiskers Harbour\u201d. However, as it had been raining, Toto the Loco, Clown A Round and the Playground were soaked and too wet to sit on \u2026 and the Bouncer house was deflated.We therefore found Ocean Park to be incredibly disappointing on a wet day for young kiddies from a ride perspective.o The atmosphere at Disneyland was amazing (it even wore off on my stoic husband!), and every employee that we encountered (including the cleaners!) was entirely fabulous with our kiddies \u2013 unfortunately we just didn\u2019t pick up that same vibe at Ocean Park \u2026 it really had the same atmosphere as a shopping centre.o We were amazed by the difference in demographics between the two parks \u2026 we found Disneyland to be mainly frequented by families with young children, whereas almost everyone that we encountered at Ocean Park were adults, and many of those were middle-aged (particularly in the afternoon when the tourist buses arrive from the Mainland). We found that fellow park-goers at Disneyland were much more accommodating, patient and friendly \u2026 unfortunately we were on the receiving end of quite a bit of pushing and shoving in Ocean Park (and my 5yo was even pushed out of the way by a 50+ year old man racing to get to his preferred horse on the kids Merry-go-round!!!).\u2022 In terms of the animal encounters at Ocean Park we loved seeing: o The Giant Pandas (definitely the highlight of the day for my husband and I, but I think that the wonder of this experience was lost on the kids).o The dolphins at \u201cOcean Theatre\u201d (moral issues aside of course!).o The walruses & seals at the \u201cNorth Pole Encounter\u201d (try and time your visit for the seal presentation \u2026 and sit at the bottom: you will be incredibly close to these beautiful creatures!). o The Arctic Foxes in the \u201cArctic Fox Den\u201d. We were in & out of the \u201cSouth Pole Spectacular\u201d in a matter of seconds as it was just so cold! Amazingly the animals (seals and sea lions) were not on display at the \u201cPacific Pier\u201d, apparently because of the rain (which was not at all heavy)!!!\u2022 We found \u201cOld Hong Kong\u201d to be really disappointing \u2026 it just seemed to be full of souvenir stalls / food outlets, and was lacking the sense of authenticity that had been advertised!.\u2022 By the time that we got to the \u201cGrand Aquarium\u201d at 3pm, the tourist hoards had arrived by the bus load \u2013 so we decided to cut our losses and leave! We also didn\u2019t make it to the \u201cSea Jelly Spectacular\u201d or the \u201cGarden of Joy\u201d.So in summary, we are glad that we went, but we are disappointed with the experience, and disappointed that we spent our son\u2019s 5th birthday there instead of Disneyland. If you have limited time, and young children, I would recommend Disneyland over Ocean Park in a heartbeat. If you do go, pre-purchase your tickets (but try to avoid a wet day), get there when the park opens, and do your research about where to best spend your time (their website is very informative)."

            "review": "Sea World + Carnival + Knotts + Zoo. I have to give it to the Chinese for this innovative theme park. They really used the land well to fit everything under the sun into it. The views are spectacular! While being large and diverse is it's advantage, it's also it's disadvantage. It's so enormous and has so much to do that it is impossible to do it all in one day. Instead of trying to do everything in one day we decided to hit specific parts of the park that would be new to us. We traveled with our 2 daughters, ages 7 and 12, and by the end of the night they were excited, filled with memories, and worn out. That's what I call a good experience.We highly recommend you view the digital map from their website to strategize or get a basic idea of where everything is at. We decided to skip the cable car ride and used the tram to go from the Waterfront (lower) to the Summit (upper) since we previously did the cable car ride at Lantau Island. One, it's a 4 minute ride vice a 15 minute ride and every minute counts. Two, more people fit inside the tram than the maximum of 6 people to a cable car making it more efficient. Third, cold AC! We focused much of our time on the rides and skipped out on shows. This worked out for us because while the locals sat for the shows, we had shorter lines. We figured that the shows would be pretty similar to what we've seen at Sea World and other similar parks and also decided it wouldn't be the same with the language barrier. In no particular order, we experienced:-Arctic Blast x 2 (slow but youngest daughter enjoyed it)-Arctic Fox Den, North and South Pole Encounter (used to cool down)-Hair Raiser x 2 (not bad)-Whirly Bird-Bumper Blaster (longest wait, about 40 minutes)-Mine Train x 3(favorite and views from a roller coaster and line that CANNOT be beat)-Raging River x 2 (get more wet than the Rapids ride)-The Rapids x 2 (nothing spectacular)-Shark Mystique (to cool down)-Crazy Galleon x 4 (most exciting for youngest daughter)-The Dragon x 2 (head bounces around a lot)-The Eagle (not for those with fear of heights)The best thing to snack on during the day were their small watermelons which ended up being about 7 USD. Both refreshing and tasty, this is something Disney needs to do. We decided to eat at the Bay View Restaurant since this was a recommendation we found online (it's like a cafeteria they said). Personally, we did not find the food (4 individual meals) worth $114. Maybe it's the view and A/C that you pay for but then again, you can get the same view from the outside and find other places with A/C to cool down in. My recommendation is to save your money on the food and instead go for either souvenirs or watermelons throughout the day. We finished up the Summit around 7 p.m. and headed down to the waterfront to let the kids soak themselves up in the Waterfront station (swimsuits are a must). It was a perfect way for our girls to end the day. The attractions are housed in a huge open \"warehouse\" type of building. It houses a foam station, water swings, waterslide, and a water station. It is controlled very well with limited people per station for time. One can choose to get on over and over again. With closing time after the water show/fireworks at 8 p.m. we decided to grab some souvenirs and beat everyone to the bus lines. Well worth it but definitely need to plan what you will want to do inside the park. Tons of walking so ensure you have the proper footwear. Sun block, umbrellas, and water are a must. Enjoy."

The lines for the rides were long, and there's only 1 or 2 suitable for smaller children. The Pandas, Goldfish, Jellyfish and Penguins were our favourites. Worth your time for sure. Take swimsuits for children in summer, they had a waterplay centre set up for kids"

Wait times for rides were getting to 75 minutes - just couldn't be done on the normal hot summer day.Plenty of penguins to see; the walrus was impressive. The polar exhibits provided a cool respite to the sweltering outside.There was one red panda, and one giant panda. Did not know where the rest were.Although the cable car looks like a nice ride, choose the train to get to the top of the park. The queue was ridiculous for the cable car - 60 minutes at any time of the day.By 1430, my kids had had enough of the heat, the inability to get on rides, and the underwhelming animal exhibits. We were on our way out, and came across a summertime indoor water park area. This was the only saving grace for an otherwise, pretty ordinary day. Check the guides to see if it's still open, and bring swimming costumes to change into - there are change rooms.The slide, and other play equipment is good fun, with not much waiting. There is even a foam (suds) play area.Read my other review on Disneyland. For my family, Disney was by far, the better park."

I loved the rides. Recommend the water tyre ride, went on ride twice & couldn't stop laughing. Got soaked which was great on a hot day. Roller coaster also amazing. Even had an Australian area with wallabies, kookaburras & koalas. Caught local bus to Central & then star ferry. All in all a great day.

It is worth the hassle of getting there (skip the bus and take a taxi). The food includes local favorites such as red bean pudding and vegetables stuffed with fish paste. The food is worth a try but I wouldn't go to the park hungry. The cable car is a must do although it can be a little disconcerting as you rise higher and higher toward the clouds. The Toto the Loco ride is so bad it's good and a perfect example of a Chinese theme park ride. The dolphin show is also worth seeing. Disney is fun if you want to see what it's like when a western company tries to implant itself in the complex diversity of Hong Kong."

The feeding of the Panda was scheduled for 10:00am which is the park's opening time. There is very little provision for seating and shading for respite on a hot day.

I had been with a day's pass, but it is a bit too much to cover the entire park in a day. Ocean Park is a multidimensional theme park.By the virtue of its name one gets an impression that it could be a massive water amusement park. Once inside,it is full of surprises. Actually, at the end of the visit,I wondered whether the name Ocean Park is justified? Finally, I felt convinced thinking it is a ocean of surprises to discover and a it has a ocean of activities to experience. The park has many categories some of which are up the mountain, which can be reached either by a cable car ride or by the Ocean Express-a theme ride in a train.The cable car ride offers some stunning views of the sea. I managed to ride it twice. Expect long queues if visiting on weekends.  Apart from having the largest aquarium,the park also features a rare collection of koala,california sea lions, panda,seals etc. The Dolphin show is the main attraction of the park and makes one to wonder how dolphins and seals could be so human friendly. The view of the sea in the backdrop,with ships passing by is awesome. From thrilling rides to water front shows to walking down in the old city one never realizes how the morning tranforms to evening.The grand finale is however the 'Symbio', a fountain show at Aqua city where jets of water form a 360 degree water screen. A story of two dragons is projected on this water screen amidst amazing sound effects and fire spewing out from the water. It is a one of a kind show only seen at Ocean Park. Overall,it offers a memorable experience especially for kids."

Very well maintained. The rides were excellent, something for everyone. The Flash was our favourite for those who like being swung upside down at great heights! Hair Raiser was excellent too. The 2 water rides were nice for the younger kids. Do not try The Dragon or the Rev Booster. The Dragon looks thrilling but it was very bumpy, rough, quite terrible. My head was thrown side to side hitting the sides of the protective pull-down barrier. On the Rev Booster, passengers sit in cars that are arranged in a circle. The cars move in a circle at high speed. Each seat can sit 2 or 3 passengers. When the ride starts, passengers end up being swung to the edges of their seats, and pressing down on top of each other, as they hold on for dear life. Although the height restriction allows kids as young as 8 to ride on it, I would not even recommend this for adults! It is a terrible ride! The food outlets served a range of food like fried chicken, pasta, baked rice. They tasted quite terrible and were expensive too. Cost around 50HKD. Drinks were 30HKD. There was one McDonalds outlet which had understandably an extremely long queue. Ocean park was built over some hills, so do expect lots of walking up & down hills. The cable car ride was excellent offering beautiful views of the water in the day, and gorgeous lights in the night !"

I have visited Ocean Park twice now, first time via the cable car (not a lover of heights), however the picturesque scenery made the 10 minute transfer bearable. The second time via the express train. There are so many people as such a busy place however very impressed by the smooth operations of staff getting people lined up and on to the cable car of the express shuttle service. The view from the top is amazing, however the many wonderful things to do and see at Ocean Park is amazing. Plenty of toilets and eateries, benches, seats to rest, lining up for rides did not appear an issue either. My favourites places visited were the Aquarium where you see so many different species of fish, sharks, seahorses, walrus, seals, stingrays, eels, you name it they have it and can view from glass roof tops with stingrays flying over your head and the larger sharks makes for a scary but exciting venture... The Artic Wolves are so cute, first visit were only pups, now grown up, very active when the food is out, then back to sleeping when not. The Pandas do not appear to want to know you, both times hardly got to se their faces, often showing their rear ends more to the public Lol... They have new enclosure that requires much quiet, the Australian Zoo, this was such a treat to see our native animals being viewed by the rest of the worlds visitors to this place, great advertisement for AUST. Kookaburras, Koalas, kangaroos.... The Asians love them... so they should they are amazing creatures... Cant fault this place, a must see for young and old. Plenty of souvenir shops with a wide range of quite reasonably priced items. Take a stroll down Old Hong Kong as they simulate what HK looked like back in the day. The rides are user friendly however more so designed for young families and the thrill seekers... Some nearly made me throw up just watching the kids scream for joy... A must see experience... Cost is approx. $350 HK with free transfer from most hotels, however you have to get your own way back and if anything was a chore on the day was the very long wait at the taxi stand, one lane for each side of HK and no seats... standing in the heat can be a chore..."

What happened to your eyes?? Because, besides the rides, the shows, the aquarium and the lot, Ocean Park has some of the most spectacular views you can hope to get at an amusement park. I actually found myself getting on some of the rides for the sheer pleasure of the views they offered of the Ocean, or the rolling hills around. That the view came with some thrills was a huge bonus.The park is huge, and you are always likely to miss a key section, that is at a level below the main area. This one has the mine train, the river rapids etc. I advise you to check it out, as it has some of the better rides, lesser crowds, and of course, the views:) Frankly, even the escalator that takes you down to the minetrain level or back is spectacular.Frankly, between Disneyland and this, I would vote for Ocean Park if rides is what your game is. If it's shows that you want, then you should put Disney on your schedule too."

Exhibits were overall very educational. I like reading stuff so I got a lot out of it. My wife does not like reading stuff, but she really enjoyed exhibits as well. The food choices are somewhat limited. The restaurants are typically average quality at high prices. I suggest the Bayview restaurant. It's reasonably cheaper, and it's essentially cafeteria style food. You have the ability to control volume and cost this way. It seemed to lessen the pain. The area of the park is quite large, there is a cable car that takes you between the two sides. There is also a train that runs between the two. I suggest taking the cable car early or late in the day. You can use the train for the other direction. They will give you estimates of the line length. You can decide based on this."

Loved the red pandas, the giant pandas and especially the Koala bears. Didn't ride any of the rides and didn't eat at the park but the food all looked and smelled delicious. Great place for families or just a couple."

We visited Ocean Park with our two young daughters (both below 7 years of age) in June 2015 and found the park to be a well kept & maintained, educational and entertaining place. The majority of the rides however are for children above 120-140cm in height so our younger child missed out! Apart from the usual plethora of rides and carnival games, there are also animal exhibits which focus on marine life, e.g. seals, sea lions, walruses, penguins, pandas, sharks, fish, etc. As parents, we definitely liked this educational aspect of the park versus a pure entertainment place like Disneyland!The park is divided up into two areas - you enter via the lower park which has a number of rides and the panda exhibit, and then can take either a train or the cable car to access the upper park where the majority of the thrilling rides (e.g. the roller coasters and the ride which drops you 10 stories) are located. We definitely discourage taking the cable car up to the upper park as the queue is horrendous - instead, take the train up, and the cable car back down as the queues are more manageable then. Food is plentiful and runs the range from cheap to expensive, and given that this is a more mature park, the trees and shelter from the sun are more developed. On the day that we were there, it was extremely sunny and hot so remember to drink lots of water to stay hydrated. There are drinking fountains thoughtfully dotted around the park so you needn't buy bottles of water all the time.Distance from Causeway Bay where we stayed was around 15min by taxi so it's very close to the central area of Hong Kong island."

In my 7 times i have been to hong kong i have been here 3 times ( i love hong kong if you havent guessed) and the only reason i never visited ocean park on more occassions is i didnt have time. the park itself is a great theme park with great rides, an ocean type park with dolphin displays etc and probably the biggest aqaurium tanks you will ever see. In these tanks they have the fish and turtles and sharks to match the size of tanks aswell .it is a brilliant day out with all the features youd expect and the prices are not rip off either. the park is in two sections one is where you enter the park where there is loads of rides and animals etc ( have a look at the pandas while you are in this bit aswell they are really well looked after here) and the other part of the park where there is a lot more sealife bits and loads more rides is on the outer edge of the headland with some hills in between and the way they are connected is a cable car system with loads of cars running all the time ( the waiting time is only a minute or 2) or if you dont like cable cars they run a coach around to the other side of the park and you go in the small back entrance and there is a couple of esculators to take you to the top where the park is ( this way takes about 15-20 mins) ive done both ways and the cable cars are the better way.the park is clean modern and very safe and a great day out you wont be sorry you went.check out the rides and bits on the popular online video service i dont know if im allowed to name and you think its a great place as i always have.we stayed on the island when we went and used a taxi when we went and this was quite cheap ( only a little more than the bus) but make sure he goes through the tunnel under the mountain on the island it cuts the journey down by loads and the taxi fare aswell unless you want the scenic route of course.it can get a tiring day so dont rush around too quickly and it can be a bit hilly due to where it is. it is very disabled freindly so even if youre in a wheel chair you are still ok on pretty much everything there. check the weather aswell as the first time i went there was a rainstorm ( it only lasted about an hour) and the rainstorms here are proper rainstorms ( the pathways turn to rivers in a matter of minutes) once the rainstorm had stopped the warm climate of the place it was dry in no time"

This gives you a better chance of doing all you want to.We deliberately avoided the weekend (and its assumed larger crowds). Pretty sure our theory was sound, because even though we did a fair bit of queuing, friends who went the next weekend struck horrendous queues.We didn't have young kids, so bypassed attractions geared to those age groups. If you take kids, there are services available to make life easier. Including wrist bands for their name and your contact details (tried to pin one on our 13 yr old, but, he wasn't keen). You can also hire lockers to store any gear you don't want to lug around all day.We started with the Grand Aquarium, which was fantastic, then wandered around the lagoon before heading to the cable car. There are various places around the park where you will be offered a photo of your group. Sometimes you won't even know your picture has been taken. Don't be pressured into buying if the shot isn't that good, because there is likely to be a better one around the corner.The Cable Car was a great way to get to the Summit. Brilliant views and a really unique bonding experience for the family (i.e. conversation turned to \"what happens if the cable breaks?\"). That doesn't bear thinking about, so best just to snuggle-up and do a lot of ooohing and aaahing about the view.The Summit has a big range of rides, some suitable for families/younger members, and others for the more adventurous/mad. This is where your day can disappear on you!Walking, queuing, riding, eating, etc., means time just vanishes. Roller coaster fans should love the Hair Raiser. It's long (so's the wait), it's scary, and it's on the side of a cliff! If you can keep your eyes open, there is also an amazing view from up there. There are the likes of Polar Adventure and Ocean Theatre for those preferring more sedate activities. We even enjoyed the long escalators.The Summit closes before the Waterfront. Our clue was that rides started shutting down, and it was getting dark. We took the Ocean Express back to the Waterfront, and it was also brilliant.We had to queue (think it's the only way down at that time), but, the train and waiting area is 1930's science fiction nautica-like (think Captain Nemo's Nautilus). Inside the train is very theatrical, main lights turned off, nautical/ocean movie playing on the ceiling, and special effects lighting/sound made it a really cool experience.That time of night there was a light show at the lagoon which was also pretty cool, and a great way to end our day.Outside the entrance were plenty of waiting cabs, and a stream of others arriving all the time. There were a lot of people wanting cabs, and some queue jumpers, but, we managed to get ours without really waiting at all (perhaps luck, or, maybe we were more organised/aware than others).All up, an awesome day and a brilliant park (although we still didn't get to everything we wanted).My tips: 1. Plan ahead; 2. Avoid weekends/public holidays; 3. Get there early."

I think we had a discount of 10% off the ticket price.There is a playground and bouncy castle for young children. The froggy ride was also very fun for young children. However, we do noticed that a number of rides were closed at the children's section of the theme park.If you like to take the cable car, do arrive early or take it on the way down from the summit (and before the closing time - say 4 to 5pm), otherwise, expect a long wait.If you ares staying at mongkok or Tsim sha tsui, it's more convenient to take the mini bus back... There will be drivers directing you to their buses and it takes one to mong kok is less than 30 mins. We usually take these buses as it beats taking the hsu and then mtr...

We sought relief in the penguin enclosure which is cooled to mimic the north pole. They are also very strict on the minimum height restrictions for rides. There were also several rides out of action on the day we visited which was very disappointing. Perhaps check in advance if you have time to find out what rides are running on the day you plan on going. All in all a great day out.

My 4 year old child enjoys this attraction better than Disneyland!"

            "review": "Beyond words !!! An AMAZING place!!!. This is the best theme park I have been to so far. It has not only got some crazy and awesome rides, but also a lot of interesting and awesome things too see.It is the right kind of place for just about anyone to visit. A group of friends, family, office colleagues just about anyone.It has got enough number of rides / attractions to see over a period of 2 days easily.A group of friends wanting to go to some scary an awesome rides, or a groupo of family wanting fun rides for your kids? There is a ride for every single kind of person who enters this place. Small play areas for infants, mini rides like - carousel, dashing cars, etc for the young ones, or rather scary and huge roller coaster rides for the adrenaline rush craving enthusiasts. I dont think there would be anyone who would come back disappointed out of this place.They also have a wide range of restaurants here catering to all kinds of needs. Fancy lavish restaurants to simple fast foods like McD / Popeye.Theya have many attractions related to wildlife, animals and birds - a shark mystique attraction, an atraction for the north / south poles showcasing penguins, arctic fox, polar bears; sea-life attractions with different kind of fish, seal, walrus etc; australian attractions like koala bear, kangaroo rats etc. These are not only awesome to watch but very informative with a lot of interactive apparatus for students, kids or the interested ones.One of their main attraction in this space is the giant aquarium they have. You get to see a wide variety of species with the best possible close view.It is amazing how they maintain these many things, so efficiently and neatly.They even have a Gondola to go to the top section which again is a beautiful ride. You have a view of the harbour, whole of ocean park and the complete greenery that is surrounding Ocean Park, this is view is just describable in words.I would say, if you are visiting Hongkong, this is a must visit place."

We had a full day experience at Ocean Park where the kids played the games and enjoyed the aquarium and the Cable cars experience as well as the climbing train. The Park was packed with tourist groups from China, and we could not play much due to the timing and there were long ques. In my opinion, the best time to visit the Park is after 14:00. Dont miss the Rapids, the close encounters with the Panda and the Penguins, and the new short roller coaster!"

We had our full day dedicated enjoying the Hong Kong Ocean Park. If you're a thrill seeker, you'd surely enjoy their nerve rockin rides. Since we have a small child travelling with us, we skip the rides and just went sightseeing. They have a huge stadium for the dolphin/sea lion show. But I didn't enjoy the show as much as the show presented at the Ocean Park in Subic (they have more tricks there, just see it for yourself). What I like most is our cable car ride where you can have a breathtaking view of the whole park. Our 5 year-old son even enjoyed it. You can also take the express train going to the other side of the park but you can't see anything while inside the train because it go thru inside the mountain tunnel so it's just total darkness until you reach the other side. And lastly, they have an extensive collection of fish and sea creatures which is very educational for kids and adults alike."

They said if you go to HK you have to see it. So we made sure it got included to our sightseeing package. When you buy it, you should already have the ticket. This makes it easier for you to enter the ocean park, because you only need around 5 minutes, while others have to stand a long time, in order to buy the ticket. The outlook of the park is really big, and nicely designed and it is easy to find your way through with the printed maps and road signs. As soon as you get in, there is a possibility for you to take a break in the coffee. Right next to the coffee you can rent a wheelchair or childen cart for a reasonable price. This is great! If you got a person, whose walking capabilities are a little ristricted, you should take this opportunity, because the park is HUGE and even exhausting for a person who can walk quite well. Everything is interesting to see, be advised that when the Pandas are out a LOT of people interested to see them. You should also take the little tram that gets you from one side of the park to another side. This is a great picture opportunity. So, go out and visit it :)"

Got on first five rides without waiting. It gets a lot busier in the afternoon but longest we waited for a ride was 25 minutes. Also went to the dolphin show which was short but sweet.

I am usually very sceptical about zoos but ocean park does a lot in terms of green and environmental education and they provide nice and spacious living areas for the animals. I love this place, it just has such a special atmosphere. My favourite part is probably old hong kong, which is right before you enter the cable car downstairs."

My family also like to play some game but money goes fast .Its not hard to win if you willing to spend some money or you are the expert. 20 minutes of Cable car ride is must but go earlier to Q the line and coming back to take the fast 5 minutes train ride . It has many snack places or restaurants but its not cheap . Only place I like to eat at is penguin or aquarium restaurants . The food is so so but its fun to see the penguin swim around . Make sure you wear a jogging shoes ,umbrella and a rain coat for the wet rides. Ocean Park not allow you to bring food inside the park . I saw some people had to eat the food they tried to bring in before entering the park .I bought the annual card and try to go there at least three times a year ,otherwise you won't make it back.

Like many reviewers have rightly said before, they were too young for most of the rides. However features like the Polar Adventure (penguins, arctic fox, seal, walrus etc), Shark Mystique, Expedition Trail (animals and birds in a rainforest), Amazing Asian Animals (Pandas, golden fur monkey) are outstanding and highly recommended. In fact, it would take a couple of days to go through the park fully. Only grouse is that they should add water rides for the kids - my children were really looking forward to it and were somewhat upset when they realised there were none :("

We made do with noodles and broccoli with chilli sauce. We did not have time to search for other restaurants as everything takes quite a long walk. The North pole did not have the Polar Bear for some reason which was a disappointment. Then we took the Ocean Express which gives the feel of sitting in a submarine.It can get quite crowded though.

Bring brellies and raincoats for I doubt that good weather will be permitted at all times. I think that it is really misty out there. 3. Wear comfy shoes. You will be spending the entire day walking and walking and walking at very long distances. Attractions are scattered and too far from each other. If I will compare it here, it\u2019s like going to Hoyohoy then to Guimad and to Gala. Mind you, it is not just hills in Hong Kong Ocean Park that you\u2019re gonna stroll to. These are mountains!4. Enter all portals to all attractions, theater shows, and rides for these are already included in admission. Make the most out of your time in Hong Kong Ocean Park!5.

When you're at the peak, there's a shortcut to the cable car queue inside the BayView restaurant.If you're interested in viewing the pandas, take note of the show times otherwise you'll find the panda asleep. Food in Ocean Park is not as expensive (about 60-100HKD) compared to HK Disneyland. We got 3 pcs pork buns at 30HKD (or 40HKD) near the entrance which is already enough for a quick snack. Bring water to save money and to keep hydrated because it can get really hot and humid. Avoid the park on weekends because it's very crowded. Senior citizens may get bored and irritated with the crowd."

My 4 year old loves the kids playground and if you get there early on a weekday, you can beat the crowds and have multiple rides on the carousel, frogger and mini train without having to wait in line. There are thrill roller coaster rides for the older kids and the aquarium, penguins and panda bears are a must see for the animal enthusiasts. The train is a convenient way to get to the other side of the mountain If you don't want to queue up for the cable car and if you come back by cable car, you pass by the old Hong Kong and can try the Chinese softie ice cream - yum.

The Water Front includes red and giant pandas, primates, exotic bird aviary and the largest dome aquarium in the world, holding over 4000 fish. The Summit includes dolphins, walruses, seals, sharks, arctic foxes, snow owls, king and gentoo penguins, sturgeon aquarium and assorted rain-forest animals.

The diversity of activities and nature of those activities are very unique compared to other parks. Taking the cable car is a MUST, even though the queue might be very long to take the cable car, but it worth the wait. The only down side of the park is food. As a foreigner who is not an Asian-food-friendly, I suffered to find something to eat."

We did not go for their Halloween night which the Ocean Park is best known for since I can't stand any scary jumpy things. If you like haunted house and if you are from very different culture it would be interesting for you as there are many unique local/ Asian elements put into the themes. \"PRICES\" They have been raising the price so much and this is too high for local standard. However considering how much they have invested and improved in the past years it's a pass for me. I can always get 15% discounts myself anyway. For tourist buy at some discount booths near the shuttle bus station. Be cautious to touting outside park entrance.\"TIMING\" Weather was perfect. Not recommended to go in summer if you are not fit enough as the park is divided in 2 parts and is built on hill lots of walking is expected. A hot sunny day could go up to 35 degrees and lots of typhoon during July and August (I went during on and off Typhoon 8 before and the wind was scary). Check weather or get yourself ready before you go. Although it closes early on \"RIDES\" Due to the occupation it was not busy at all, we barely queued for anything and hence we had so much fun. The rides are decent but apart from the Hair Raiser none of them really worths long queuing time. Some of the very old ones really need refurbishment or reinvented. Though, going on rides in Ocean Park would be a one of its kind experience as many of them are built on top of hills and right next to sea. The view is spectacular and extraordinary on front seats! Highly recommended.\"NATURE\"Meeting the Panda is a MUST-Do. but be aware this is up to these chubby adorable to show up or not so sometimes queuing for 1 hour during peak season does not guarantee you can meet them. There are two houses you can see them though. The one nest to the big eye goldfish room allows a closer look to them. Don't miss out Sea Jelly Spectacular and the dolphin show! You will be impressed! The park is very well done and well balanced in both educational and entertaining parts. \"FOOD\"Overpriced as expected in any other theme parks. I personally suggest to go for the booth between summit plaza and rainforest where their prices for chicken and fries make more sense than other places. Bring your own food to save budget.\"SOME UNEXPECTED SILLY FUN\" You can shoot people who are on the Rapids for free...and unlimited. My boyfriend was so malicious enough and spent a good 10 mins shooting people in their faces. There are several shooting places, the one outside Expedition Trail's Exit has the best angle. He told me I have to add this in to let people like him to know... Have Fun"

Currently there is a lot of renovation, so if you visit in the next few months, be prepared not to have a full park at your disposal. The queue management is not handled very well which means if you have a long queue there is not much entertainment other than a fan blowing warm air in your direction and watching fellow fun seekers. Many rides were 'closed' for maintenance on the day we visited (a Friday) including the Hair raiser and the River Rapids. They can do this according to the T&C's without notice. The park gets really crowded at times and sadly not many of the park guests understand theme park etiquette. In fact signs constantly remind people to queue orderly - which they don't. Beware of guests not watching where they are walking as they are staring into a phone and selfie sticks and umbrellas become a real nuisance. The bird show is a waste especially for English speakers and the dolphin show was ok. The new aquariums are very good and the panda exhibit is very well done. Having done both the big parks in HK on this visit and if asked which I would recommend, at this time, I would have to say Disney especially since Disney have added some new thrill rides. This said, if you have the time, budget and the patience it makes a great day out. Bonus - you are done by 6.30 pm and that leaves more time for shopping."

Pretty good theme park with a variety of rides and attractions for all ages, the grand aquarium is huge and you can dine looking into it.The park is based in two separate sections you go between by gondola or tunnel train. At 4-6pm both of these ways have extremely long queues as family's rush back to the entry/exit side. The wait can be more than 120minutes; to avoid this I suggest heading straight to the adventure side when u arrive at the park and heading back to the entry side by 3pm to see all of the attractions.Most of the visitors are families and as a result children's rides have significant queue times and the adrenaline rides have very short queues(5-20min).The best way to get there and back is on the 629 buses, straight outside central subway station, you, can't miss it.The park is definitely worth a visit, but they do have captive dolphins(sad face), so If you have any compassion for cetaceans I would recommend missing the sea lion and dolphin show( queues will be shorter during this as an added bonus)."

It's been well reviewed so here's some things I had missed, or just didnt know:1. It's built on a huge hill and is split in two parts. You have to take either the gondola or train between the two sections. Even so, it's really hilly in parts. There's a big escalator on the ocean side, but be prepared for some hiking... I knew it. Was hilly and quite enjoy walking but I found it tough going at times.2. There wasn't a published list (that I could find) of daily shows and attractions in chronological order. This info is all on the website, but we couldn't pick up a list at the gate and it's not on the reverse of the park map.3. If heading down by gondola, the access is actually under the gondola. It's not intuitive. Head for the dolphin show arena and follow the signs from there.4. We visited on a weekday and were there from the moment the park opened, went straight to the top and virtually had the place to ourselves for around 2 hours. There was no wait for any rides in this time. It became very busy after 1230/1300, mostly tour groups.5. This attraction is not wheelchair friendly in my view. We took the stroller and I could carry it up and down stairs and escalators at times if required, but I anticipate it would be incredibly difficult for a PWD."

I have found that the best way is to enjoy your day out but please please don't judge on the mainland tourist as they still have a lot of learning and understanding in more westernised culture"

Tips; weekday they don't open till 1030, close 630pm.Catch MTR to Admirality st and you can buy cheapest tickets at the Grey liner shop (I think it's called) but it wasn't opened just before 9am. Alternatively there is a tourist info shop just near EXIT B which is ocean park exit where tickets are still cheaper than park we saved about $100as a family.

The Ocean park is conveniently located near the Admiralty MTR station and there is a regular bus which goes there from the station itself. The aquarium at the ocean park is hugely educative about the various ocean species and how we can help preserve the oceans for a better future. Afterwards, we took a train to the summit and indulged in various rides and saw the various enclosures. The cable car ride from the summit is highly recommended. Also don't miss the dolphin show and the various animal enclosures on the summit. The food arrangements are also quite comprehensive."

Shows were good. Enjoyed meeting Panda, Penguins and also dolphin show. Many many things in here. There is cable car inside in here also another option is train ocean express. Food is very expensive also and if you are muslims there are few halal restaurants. Over all had very good time and would definately recommend to visit this place."

Also instead of waiting hours in line for the cable car ride, you should either use the ocean express to go up in the morning and then take the cable car down or wait till late evening to ride the cable car up The food in most cases is highly overpriced and very average in quality, would recommend spending as little as possible on the food there."

The Ocean Park is a common theme park for the Hongkongers with many adult rides as compared to Disneyland. if you are a theme park person and only have 1 full day to spare, forget about disneyland, just go to Ocean Park. you will have much more fun there. It's a little inconvenient to get there now as you will have to take the MTR to Admiralty Station at Hong Kong Island and change to a public bus to get there. But not to worry, they seem to be building a Ocean Park Station just outside the theme park and it might be ready by 2017 i think!"

            "review": "FULL DAY of fun! Great to go with friends..Go early!!!. This theme park is meant for the young and old..It is very tiring for the very young and very old in my opinion. The land space of this theme park + zoo is massive.I patronised with my friends. We are in our 20s and 30s, and here are some money saving tips for all visitors..Purchase tickets at Admiralty MTR station, the shop is located in an area where there is a row of retail shops (and a Mrs Fields cookie counter, please note my information is effective as of March 2015), this row leads towards a dead-end and a hidden toilet. This shop is the 2nd last as far as I can remember.It IS THE cheapest we found, your savings is slightly more than HK$100 per ticket. You\u2019re welcome!! \uf04a :)If this shop does not exist, there is an alternative. Another shop located along Exit B, facing the staircase. It is not as cheap as the first mentioned, but still, it is still cheaper than buying tickets directly at Ocean Park.Next, walk out of the MTR basement via Exit B, and take bus service 629, it is a 1 way fee of HK$10.60, or simply tap your tourist Octopus card which you can loan during your trip. The bus ride is very fast and it is a direct service, unless you take a new service, 629A which has a few stops. (Please plan your visit to reach the MTR station as early as 9.30am for a weekday, so you can enjoy the entire day in Ocean Park..)Wear comfortable shoes, be prepared to walk alot, and bring a bottle of water/drink too (to save yourself on the first drink, because food and drink get very expensive in touristy places of interest as you know, about HK$27 for a bottled drink). I was very surprised to see some women wear like they came from work, in heels and dainty handbags. lol.There is not much of a need to rent a locker, it is not cheap. Unless you have bulky carry-ons? Still, even with rides, you can safely place your belongings and even slippers or shoes if you think they might drop out, in the designated area/shelf/baskets.These areas are safe as long as you remember to collect your belongings after the ride.With friends, we \"strategized\" our visit to the park by taking the cable car all the way up, playing as many major rides as possible, and come back down via the express train to see the animals featured near the child-friendly rides..No regrets on that, the view of the entire cable car ride was breathe taking and yet very scary because of the amazing height shifts from one pole to another whilst transferring up!!Biggest regret was to take the red & yellow looking rollercoaster ride first (near the penguins enclosure) and being greedy, we sat that 3 times straight! The more I sat for that, the dizzier I became.Other rides aren't that bad, the bumper cars brought entertainment to us, whirly bird that was relaxing, so did the fast moving (no upside down loop) rollercoaster that went 2 rounds at 1 go.My highlight of the visit was the various animal exhibits (sharks and rays, jelly fish, sturgeons, snow fox, panda, goldfish section, giant salamander!!)..OH, and the mine train rollercoaster on another side of the theme park, that ride is VERY VERY OLD but maintained of course. The fear factor is the sound made when our carriages go up the slope, and the 2 drops that brings your stomachs flying while you get to overlook the entire hill to the ocean!!That was the most scary and exciting ride within the park, sat that 3 times and my heart told me to stop riding because I couldn't stop shaking from the adrenaline.There is a river log ride near this mine train rollercoaster, but it was closed for quality checks when we visited. If I am not wrong, its a water log ride that eventually brings you to a steep drop along with a big splash (facing the ocean too). Ponchos a must if you want to stay dry.Which brings me to a ride that is a waste of time, a rapid river ride that is located in the area near the red & yellow loop rollercoaster. Ride it only if you brought a poncho of if you are prepared to get wet. If not, you\u2019ll definitely get soaked, be it your head, body or legs!!Another tip would be to ask nicely for a poncho from some1 who exits the ride, so that you don\u2019t end up spending more money. Some of these ponchos have been rotating from person to person in order to save money!!Food is also not a problem with handful of choices, but just be prepared to spend. Game stalls galore in at least 3 sections of this park, and its all in the name of fun for a sum of money to play.Only managed to watch 1 animal show (yes this place is massive, there\u2019s insufficient time to see and do everything), where they featured walrus, seals and dolphins, it was quite heart warming but also..Sad if you sat there the entire time to watch, somehow you\u2019ll know what I mean.My overall experience of this visit was great, except the sudden increase in patrons after 2pm (this was a weekday, a Tuesday).Mainly visitors of PRC came in tour groups, and its unfortunate that I\u2019ve to say this, but they really spoil your entire experience. Talking at the top of their voices even in an enclosed place, cutting queues without hesitation as if we were invisible, doing stupid things such as standing over the yellow line of safety, bending far over the barriers at the express train and sticking their head out. And when the train arrives, they push their way in and run for dear life, all for a prevcious sear,for a ride that was a really short trip back down to the main area near the entrance.. My only line of defence was to elbow my way, block and ignore, I was thoroughly annoyed for several parts during our play time there. Other than that, the staff in this park are great, the entire environment makes you feel lifted in spirits and full of cheer. We played all the way till 7+pm, left for Admiralty MTR and popped back into town for dinner.I would recommend patrons to go back to Admiralty MTR the way you arrive, by bus. Taking a taxi cab is expensive in my opinion.I would revisit this place again because of the high entertainment value for my friends and I. \uf04a Hope my review helps! Thanks for reading. :)"

In fact, some of the roller coasters there offer the most stunning views in the WHOLE WORLD! No kidding. Crowd control is generally excellent, although the staff usually cannot do much with the commonly aggressive, line-jumping mainland tourists (Disney do a much better job dealing such).Another must-visit is the Dolphins show.The lines to the gondola line may be long but it's a must-do while visit Hong Kong.

The koalas and wallabies, for instance, looked especially morose because they were in a building that featured no sunlight and was too air-conditioned - which is not the proper environment to house these beautiful creatures seeing as they're from a warm, sunny climate such as Australia. The people who work at the attractions and enclosures don't seem to do much because there were dozens upon dozens on people cutting the lines to all the attractions, which was angering by the end of the day. I wish the employees would enforce no shoving and no cutting rules to keep some order. The theme park with the roller coasters was the more enjoyable section because less people pushed on those lines."

It's like the biggest amusement park there is, with sea animals included.The Hair raiser, Mine Train, raging River & Cable Car- just stole my heart & I just got to try it.I was scared of rides before, one that turns you upside down, and literally lose your sense of direction.But To me, getting to ride it, is just One Achievement in my life. and being able to not close my eyes in the Ride, was worth it, even though I was Shivering and my heart almost fall out of my chest. I still dared.Why?Cause I'm afraid, and i want to overcome my fear by knowing how much will i fear once I tried it.But when the ride is over & I'm still alive. Then I know, there is nothing to be scared of and the experience was Wicked. I screamed AGAIN, AGAIN to my stricken brother.The walk around the Park was painful, but the things I saw and experience, made me forget all of it.https://justcuriousz.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/hongkong-day-2-ocean-park/"

I love it here because of the halal food available just at the food court nearby the entrance. There is only nasi ayam available in the halal menu and the chicken is cold. So better carry a takeaway if it is not into your liking. We just eat it and it ok for us as we put the chicken inside the hot rice before eating it. We love everything about this place and will come back again."

It is not a typical theme park as Ocean Park has all rounded activities for adult, kids, family to enjoy a day with friends or adventures of roller coaster and swing. Be prepared as it is outdoor and weather permitted for some \"too hot and humid day\" or \"too cold that you want to stay inside\" it is a great view of the southern part of HK island and a good day of outing to get some fresh air than staying in the shopping or business area of Hong Kong urban culture. I really like their way changing from years to years with Halloween theme and haunted house, sea life and now even better with more like evening visit. 30+ years ago when I was a kid, that brought me a very enjoyable day and happiness. Right now after 30 years and I still love this place."

Easy to get to, reasonably priced, great rides & attractions, & awesome views from the cable car & roller coasters. Arrive early on a weekday & forego the cable car to catch the train straight across to the other side of the park to enjoy all the rides for a couple of hours before any crowds arrive.The McDonalds at the far end is the best option for ice creams & treats & probably the only option for coffee. The sealife (seals & dolphins) show & bird show are good if not a little corny. Make sure you catch the cable car back & stay for the final show at 7:30 at the main entrance: you wont be disappointed. Our highlights included the Arctic & Antarctic exhibitions, shark aquarium, Polar Explorer rollercoaster, Wild West Rollercoaster, Rapid River Logride, The Rapids, The Pandas, Cable Car & final show. My kids enjoyed it so much that they chose to return there the next day instead of going to Disneyland."

The variety of fishes was also good.The rides here compared to disneyland were more breathtaking.The ocean views from few spots were also superb.The park is located in two different levels. You may use trains / cable cars or escalators to go from one level to another.Overall a MUST SEE attraction if you are at HKG for a vacation.Note - You need minimum of 8-10 hours to completely enjoy this park.

And it turns out that the place is amazing! Even though it was weekend and had lots of visitors it didn't feel crowded because of its size. Only queue i had to stand was for Cable car as its not managed well and sometimes one person travels in a car which can accommodate 6 people. The boring part in Park is the Ocean express, just don't have any expectation on it and think of it like a train.On the top there are lots of fun rides like roller coaster etc. Also the best once are the Polar animals, Penguins, Arctic Fox, Seal . I loved the penguins and seals , i would rate it the best thing in the park as its endangered animals and rare species. And then there are some water rides and restaurants at the top. We just stood in the cable car queue for an hour! and came back to bottom again to see the Panda, it wasn't doing kung fu though :P there are 3 pandas.Other cool thing inside is the big aqarium which had lots of fishes and octopus. Overall i liked it and got tired at the end of day. But as i am a vegetarian i could not find any food inside except for the ice cream . so better carry your food."

The park had a large crowd waiting for it to open on a Wednesday. Having just experienced Disneyland we found Ocean Park a bit of let down as it appeared to have little thought go into its design. Some of the rides were nice and the fountain show at the end of the day was very good. If you want to ride the cable car be prepared for a long line up regardless of the time of the day. The Panda exhibition was very nice, but the aquarium which I was thinking would be a centre piece was very lacking and mediocre. Food options were regularly available with the same kind of options you would expect at any theme park. Whilst not as expensive as Disneyland if you have a choice to do only one I would thoroughly suggest forking out the extra money and going to Disney instead."

Downside would be the queues in the afternoon. We spent 30 minutes in the line for the aquarium which was quite frankly hideous. The customers from mainland China were pushing and shoving us, cutting queues and yelling. There was even a fight between 3 men waiting in line which was very unpleasant.

Tips for travellers when you visit here is you should go to summit first using the train express, and then by cable car you go to waterfront. dont waste your time at waterfront when you have arrived here, just go to summit. You can see the waterfront after finish the summit."

Would recommend two days here.The park is spread out and has an upper and lower section. Weather was overcast on the day we visited. On a clear day, the views from the cable cars and the rides on the upper level would be awesome.There are heaps of rides and the rollercoasters were great with views of the sea.There are a number of animal exhibits and shows to break up the day.Value for money is excellent and park is different to Hong Kong Disneyland, so no doubling up by going to both.We went on a Saturday, it was very busy, particularly from lunchtime. Would suggest avoiding the weekend if possible."

I recently took my 11 year old sister for a fun day at the park....get there early in the morning or face massivly long lines of mostly Chinese mainland tourists. The day started out fun and there were very short lines for rides. At 4pm the park became extremly crowded & this was a Thursday. My only complaint is that there should be park staff to monitor the lines.... there were so many toursits cutting the lines for the Hair Rasier roller coaster that we decided to leave as it was shameful. The line back on the cable car we had to wait about an hour and a mainland tourist subsequently vomited on my little sisters leg. Disgusting! I recommend getting there early and if you must return to the main entrance take the train and avoid standing in line for the cable car. Secondly......avoid the disgusting food on offer."

Got there at 10 when it opened and did not have any crowds once we enter. Great time with the great panda and red panda. Skyway was scenic and a break from the heat. The walrus and penguins were displayed well and provided very personal time with the animals. The aquarium was awesome with great variety and exhibits. There were many rides but we did not have time to go on any - standard roller coasters, etc. The food was great and reasonably priced - roast duck, noodles."

Massive tour groups racing around shouting at each other, we didn't seem to be able to get away from them! They were mainly looking at the animals rather than big rides but v rude and pushy! We got our tickets on our Dragonair flight as there was a bit of a discount and was easy. Not sure why they don't sell online. We got the bus 629 from the star ferry at 10.05 am which got us there for 10.30, opening time. We had bought rolls at subway at the star ferry point as had remembered the food wasn't great. When we arrived there was a bag check and all they seemed to be looking for was food as didn't even open smaller bags!! A very surly security lady told us we weren't allowed food and told us to go out having queued in the line. We went to sit right next to security on the wall to eat our sandwiches and she got really mad and started calling backup as if we had a weapon and insisted we go out! We then had to queue up again. I am sure their website says you can't take food but we hadn't read this and thought they were very rude and not at all interested in security. It is also annoying how many photos they want to try and sell to you during the day at rides and attractions and won't take no for an answer, you have to pose. Overall the kids still had a great time, ride queues reasonable, busier in the afternoon. Had to wait about 30 mins to get the cable car at 11am but fine once up at top level. Only saw 1 panda this time, super cute fast asleep great viewing. The other 2 pandas were in their rooms and not coming out!! - maybe too many noisy tour groups. Kids enjoyed the Dragon ride with its 3 upside down loops. It was a bit rattling on your head but not too scary. They also enjoyed the rocking boat. The Mine train is really fun right on the cliff face. We did 2 water rides and you do get wet so bring a poncho and plastic camera bag as lockers weren't working and no cover for bags on rides. Arctic foxes cute but not much room for them. Penguins and walrus section good but really busy. Paid 40 HKD for 3 fish to feed the sea lions when you just throw them in so not worth it as got 2 lots for the kids. Nice shark aquarium, liked the red panda and goldfish nearby - all v interesting. There were hardly any westerners there and the tour groups were v interested in our blonde kids - wanted photos of them - maybe could charge a camera fee?! Quite a few rides not operating, left at 5pm as v busy and all tired. Got bus 629A back. Wasn't sure where we would end up but stopped at Exchange square near a large shopping mall with walkway to star ferry. Took a while to work out where we were!"

We managed to squeeze in a few rides as well, but most of the day was spent with the programs. We found the instructors to be very knowledgeable and very good at making the learning session fun and educational. Also, the trainers of the animals were very passionate about working with them and helped to make our experience very special. We got to spend time in the water with both dolphins and seals and it was an unforgettable experience. It was one of the highlights of our holiday. I like that Ocean Park offers more than just the amusement park /aquarium / zoo experience and gives you the opportunity to really learn and get up close to the animals. It does cost extra and you can book in advance online, but I highly recommend it!"

I have been going to Ocean Park for years, but have only just got around to writing a review after a recent trip with my two-year-old son.Long before Disneyland came to Hong Kong, there was Ocean Park. Today it is still bigger, cheaper and has more rides (which are faster and more exciting). It also boasts one of the world's largest aquariums and has other animal habitats.The new panda enclosure is a great improvement on the old one, allowing visitors to get very close to these rare beasts (and providing more educational information, too). Likewise, the redesigned aquarium and penguin habitats are all great improvements. Still, visitors may want to bear in mind that Ocean Park has come in for fairly stern criticism from welfare groups in recent years over its animal care, and some people may consider that the 'zoo' part of the park is a bit of an anachronism in the 21st century.The rides and 'fun fair' part of the park are great fun, though perhaps showing their age a bit. Be aware, though, that there aren't many rides that are suitable for younger children. Still, the park overall presents good value for money - especially if you visit on your birthday (they'll let you in for free!)."

We picked up a park map available in Chinese and English versions and picked out all the things we wanted to do while we waited. As soon as the park opened there was a mad scramble for the cable car queue and you will have to run! You can of course take the express train to get to the top of the park. The different areas of the park are clearly sign posted and helpfully, members of staff were posted at strategic points to ask for directions. Despite the number of visitors in the park we didn't wait more than 30 minutes for any attraction. There are refreshment stands dotted all over the place and a few restaurants (including a McDonalds!) but they are expensive. Expect to pay around HK$25 for a bottle of water. If you don't find time to see any of the shows make sure you go see the pandas which are right by the entrance. We visited during the Easter break so there were lots of tour groups as well as regular visitors and this made the park very busy. My only negative would be the express train platform where personal space and queueing goes out of the window and you standing your ground literally is essential. There were families, couples, groups of friends and tour groups visiting so this park is suitable for all. Its a huge park and I would suggest comfortable footwear plus snacks and drinks pre bought essential. My children and i had a lovely day and would certainly return again."

We took rides which were not heart-pumping or thrill-seeking.We entered different shows which were a learning experience for us. We discovered so many things that differentiate the North & South Pole.

Yikes, as you approached the front gate and then once inside at the lower section, you were constantly blasted with music. The sound engineer must be deaf, or soon will be, and the customers will have hearing impairments if they visit too often or stay too long. Waited briefly in a moderately long but fast-moving queue to pay for entry. The park has much directed at the under 12 set but still enough of interest for the adult crowd to make the $345 HKD charge (~$45 USD) worth considering. They do accept Visa. We immediately headed to the aquarium, our main reason for going. [IMPRESSION #2] the map of the park is very confusing and signage is inadequate to really get you easily to where you may want to go. The map is more an illustrated scene than a simple and clear aid; it really was of limited help. Found the aquarium worthwhile but no match for the grandeur of Sydney or Singapore. It did a nice job of presenting sea creatures in displays that were suitable for people of all ages. Many viewing opportunities for the tots at their height were available. There were also many small and oddly shaped viewing ports into a moderately large tank that offered a different perspective of the habitat. It was a really interesting way to display their animals. We also viewed the sleeping red pandas and read about them via the informative signage. Nearby, one giant panda was prowling around its rather large, grassy enclosure. At one point it sat down on its haunches a struck a classic panda pose. The gondola ride to the south side of the park offered sufficient quiet time and panoramic views that it, too, was worth the 15-20 min. wait. We were allowed to have our car to ourselves which was a kind courtesy given the throng awaiting. It traveled a long distance, well beyond what we would have considered walking, and the views were very nice. There were both educational and entertainment features at the top. We went to the Chinese sturgeon and the jellyfish exhibits. These were smallish but again worth one\u2019s time. Like much of the park\u2019s exhibits, they encouraged social consciousness about how we use our resources and how we can preserve the environments of the displayed creatures for their sakes and for ours as well. We took the gondola back down to the lower area and were glad that we had one last chance to rest our feet and see beautiful scenery.All told, we spent about 3 hrs. at the park, and for two adults without youngsters along, this was probably sufficient. If you wanted to take in any of the rides, you could easily spend at least a half day there. Bus access to and from the Admiralty MTR station was easy."

Be prepared with the hot weather, watch people who jump queue or dont even bother to queue and just stand infront of you regardless if you are having small kids or not. Still, we had fun and its a wonderful experienced."

When I revisted the park in April 2015, the park was unrecogniseable from my last visit - the attraction is now vibrant and exciting, with areas of the park well-themed and spacious.Highlights were the revised Panda habitat and the new Adventures in Australia exhibit, which as an Australian, I found to be accurate, respectful and beautiful!The cable car is such a beautiful ride over the bay, but the new railway is also a quicl and entertaining trip.The Hair Raiser roller coaster was another highlight and shorter lines made it easy to ride attractions multiple times!My only criticism is that the park is more difficult to reach by public transport (we opted for a taxi) than Disneyland, but I noticed an MTR station is being constructed.Would now definitely recommend Ocean Park to friends and family visitng HK."

This is one of the World's Greatest Amusement Theme Park with many many rides Including World Top Ranking Roller Coaster Ride - What makes this ride ultra special is first of all it is on the mountain peak and second next to huge Ocean front rarely you get such a beautiful combination and when you are in roller coaster at many times you feel you are just hanging above the Ocean that feeling is worth millions of dollars. There are many live shows with animals and fish with Huge underwater aquarium and many many other specialized aquariums of different types of fishes including Shark, Penguin Sea Lion etc. It is so big that you need at least 2-3 days to see each and every area, activities and enjoy all the rides properly.Very good arrangement of food including Indian food joint serving hot vegetable Biryanis and Pakoras.No need to visit Disney World unless you have small kids as it is just for Kids and small sized."

But the crowds will pick up in the afternoon so do all the rides early! food and drinks will be more expensive on the inside, just like all amusement parks. But no overly crazy expensive.the roller coasters are not bad, but most of the rides are very short in duration (compared to what we're used to in North American theme parks). so you may be waiting in a long lineup just for a 1 minute ride. watch the crazy crowds roll in after lunch when the china tour groups come in!!! it then becomes super crowded and busy. if you want to take the gondola back in the afternoon there will be huge lineup (2+ hours)!! Take the train through the tunnel instead. But it's so crowded and they pack you in literally like cattle herd... so if you are clostophobic be aware. Overall, not a bad park to visit while in HK. Cheaper then HK Disney which I am told is not worth if you've been to the DL in California and WDW in Florida."

It is a zoo, has rides, walking tracks, good food, spectaclar views, and even a area for small kids to play.I enjoyed the park as much as my kids. The best things for me were the more interactive parts such as penguins and seals etc.The rides were also a lot of fun except for the the ride 'The Rapids' where you actually get sprayed with water (lots of it) and end up soaked to the skin. Apparently they provide rain coats which were not offered when I boarded the ride. Took a few hours to dry off.Probably the one issue I have is the way the park offers a family photo at the end of many of the rides. Prices rance from $98 to $198 HK. If I brought all of these it would have costed me $1000 HK about AU$180 !My suggestion to Ocean Park is to offer all the photos as a optional pack to the customers at the end of the trip on CD or print form rather than try to get us to pay on going prices as we make our way through the park.I ended up not buying anything because i'm not someone who likes being put into a forced decision as I leave a section of the park.The food prices are a bit higher than the usual Hong Kong especially the resturaunt which is about $250-$350 HK per person.Overall it's a fun place that is a bit expensive but affordable complared to Other similar parks around the world."

Ocean Park is so easy to get to. We travelled with the bus 629 that runs from Admiralty station directly to Ocean Park, the journey took about 10 minutes yesterday so we arrived just a little after 10.30am and it wasn't incredibly busy. We was a group of 6, the age ranging from elderly to teenage, and there was lots to do and see for all age groups. We got the Ocean Express to the top and worked our way down. We spent about 7 hours in there and I think we covered most of the features. The theme rides, seeing the seals, sharks, sturgeons, pandas (although they were all sleeping!) and the new additions of wallabies and koala bear (which was also sleeping). I particularly enjoyed the old Hong Kong street and the ocean wonder show is always good. I think it is safe to say, I love Ocean Park and will always come back when I'm in Hong Kong! The only let down I had which is a similar complain from my last visit but is of no fault to the theme park is once the park becomes more busy we will witness some pushing in queues and some uncomfortable nudging. Remember to take deep breaths!"

As far as value for money is concerned ocean park definitely offers more entertainment and education than Disneyland. we had a full day at ocean park two adults and two children under age of 6 and got to see most of the park but missed some bits. There is quiet a bit of walking involved to get around. Prices reasonable. Many of the rides had height restrictions that we don't often see in australia, so a little disappointing that the kids couldn't go on many of them., but that was easily compensated by being able to go to some of the aquariums. The only thing I personally didn't like at the park was the seal enclosure, no natural light, and it just didn't look like a very nice space for the animals. The time to get on rides is no where near as long as what it is at Disneyland, however expect to wait anywhere Btwn 20-30 mins. Food - one of us is a coeliac (gluten intolerant), and we couldn't find anything other than a salad to eat, so wise to take some of your own snacks to avoid getting caught short"

We took the 629 bus from Admiralty West which bring us straight to Ocean Park. The park have a really fun atmosphere which is great. We start early in the morning to beat the crowd and go straight to the Summit via cable car. You would go through \"Old Hong Kong\" to get to the cable car. Line already form as early as 10:30 AM. The view during the cable car ride was breathtaking. You have the option to take railway to the top if you're afraid of height. There's a lot of rides located at the Summit, but most of them are fast and require minimum height. Since were celebrating a 7 year old princess birthday, the animal shows are more to our cup of tea. So the dolphin, penguin, shark and seals is where we concentrate on. But, this 4 attraction located quite far from each other, so make sure to plan your day correctly, since the road connecting to each of them can be confusing. The dolphin show get full pretty fast so come early. There's also aquarium for river fish, rain forest life and jelly fish. Back down below we went to see the red and giant panda, merry go around, gold fish gallery and the grand aquarium which is really huge. We decided to skip some of the attraction like the birds and the simbio light show which schedule at 7 PM. We leave a little earlier since we don't want to be stuck with the crowd going back after the light show. After a day at Ocean Park, I can tell you this; 1) the tourist from PRC doesn't queue for anything, they charge on in throng. Avoid, or give way. 2) bring your own camera and skip the photo taking booth, run if you must. 3) food is not as expensive as many people say it is, just know where and when to eat. Lower your expectation. 4) water is important, this park is huge, you'll be dehydrated. 5) most of the ride are for thrill seeker and teens. If you're bringing toddler, go to Disneyland instead. But my kid did enjoy herself here. 6) you need 2 full day if you plan to see all the attraction and take all the ride. Avoid weekend. My advise is either, see all attraction or do all the ride."

There are some senior who had no available seat for them. It was occupy by young parent who never have courtesy giving the seat up for them. The train was dirty even though is dark in color ......,All the ride was not suitable for kids less than 1.2m ...... So my son have no ride at all. It should have warn customer in the newspaper on their advertising or leaflet when buying ticket. At least I know that my son will not be having the ride after all. I saw there are over build souvenirs shop everywhere .... This is not a park anymore and look like business park ..... Very commercial and not really a park for everyone strolling with the family like those days .......My first stop was seeing the penguin .... It was so smelly than lots of people cannot stand and walk away. There are so many fast food and souvenirs shop and not much of feature my kids can see !! The bird cage view is so bad. Cannot even see much bird like those days .... What happen to the variety of birds ....???????My son could not ride any so we go for the Dolphins show ... This was bad .... They collect HK$1000 plus for photo taking with the Dolphins .... Isn't it over business doing ...... They even charge few hundred dollar for feeding the Dolphins ....?????? This is not education at all. Those days myself can do that without paying..... I guess the Dolphins become business mammal ........,,Finally we took the cable car down and went to see the famous Panda ..... Unfortunately that panda was sleeping and not even move at all. We move over to the Aquarius section where so many small type of gold fish ..... and that's about the end of it. This is not as good as what they advertise ....... Those days everyone would choose Ocean Park over Disney Hong Kong. Now Disney is way better than this Ocean Park ........ Is a ripe off for my family ......,."

My kids went crazy over the animals! The aquarium with the different exhibits featuring seahorses, starfishes, sharks and sting rays had them in awe. Normally my kids who are used to taking afternoon naps were too excited to fall asleep!Unfortunately the Panda exhibit had no pandas (guess they all went to eat), so it was a bit boring. And I have to tell you parents in advance... if you want to save money, bring food in advance. I could not believe how pricey the food was - $100 hkd for a microscopic bowl of rice with barbecue pork and a drink, and even the McDonald's that was on site did not sell combo items, they only sold a-la-carte, so what would normally cost $30 hkd for a combo meal costs about $60 for the exact same thing. We were careful to pack some fruits and cereal for the kids but unfortunately for us adults we had to buy our own food. I will be smarter about this next time we go.The other thing is... if you are taking toddlers with you, Adventure Land don't really have too many rides that would be suitable for them, but the place you want to go would be to Whiskers Harbour. Also, Adventure Land was extremely stroller-unfriendly- too many hills, poor planning of the roads. We wasted a lot of energy carrying strollers by hand. Next time I will just stay in the lowlands.All in all... a great place for spending some quality family time, and great collection of animals."

From the fun cable car ride to the dolphin / sea lion shows and excellent rides, there is something here for all the family. The park is clean, well-managed and really well thought out. The 'Shark Mystique' experience was phenomenal and to see a diver swimming with these incredible creatures was very impressive. We really liked the fact that the experience is (or can be) very educational as well. For example, in Shark Mystique, interactive screens detail all the species, how they live, reproduce, eat, etc. This is extremely well done. Also, it is very clear that this attraction operates to support animals and marine life rather than exploit it and this sentiment was prevalent in all parts of the park. Our advice would be to pre-book tickets and arrive early (as we did). This way entry is very quick with almost no queues and the park is seemingly nicely quiet for the first few hours. It does get very busy later in the day. We didn't visit the Disney park in Hong Kong so can't compare but highly recommend Ocean Park to any family."

We got their just after it opened at 10 to beat the crowds and before the mid day sun. Bus from Central was less busy than the stop if Admiralty as we past it but to be fair there were loads of buses at Admiralty to cope with it. We bought tickets at a 7-11 before hand to save queuing on the day. 6 year old not tall enough to do rides but teenager enjoyed the roller coaster. Different cafes had seeming chinese food or lots of stalls selling fast food. Didn't look like there was any food for toddlers:babies. Put sun tan lotion on and wear or buy a hat there as if you are a slow walker or get caught in a long queue there is very little shade. Once inside the attractions it's is air conditioned so it's good even on s hot day as you can go in and out of the heat. I would advise not going on a weekend and there seemed to be an influx of big coach parties after 2pm so we did the pandas first and the took the orient express (the train up the hill in the park) to get to the top of ocean park to do the other attractions; shark, jelly fish, artic den. Roller coaster ride, dolphin show. Basically the park is split over 2 sites, up and down the hillside. We can down to do the big aquarium but by then had done everything and spent 5 hours and there was a 30 minute wait do we didn't bother but it's usu good having been there before. Shops with soft toys etc everywhere which naturally the kids loved. Got bus back to admiralty as it seemed that bus to Central only runs after 4 but I don't know if that is always the case. Admiralty bus zoo is outside the MTR station. Would recommend this park. Kids loved it"

I wouldn't compare Disney and Ocean Park.Both were worth the visit for us.Definitely more thrill rides here for bigger kids.The entire theme park is set amidst mountains, greenery and ocean, which is so unique on its own.There's loads to do here besides the rides...aquarium, dolphin/seal shows and a zoo experience all in one.Start early and you'll get more than your money's worth.Do experience both , the train and cable car (will have you curling your toes; but the view will compensate for it).The highlight for me, was most definitely getting to see the pandas....gloriously, cuddlesome creatures! Don't miss O. P. .....where else in the world would you get to see a dolphin show with the ocean as a backdrop!"

Its huge and at different levels so one requires a minimum of 2 whole days if not more to cover every thing. Children who love roller coasters will love ocean park. Even after spending 2 full days here we still missed out a lot of attractions as our kids (9 and 11 years old) wanted to repeat many of the rides. The only disappointing thing we found was that a lot of the animal shows were in Chinese.We ate in a couple places which were sort of disappointing before we found Mc Donalds. Overall a great experience and highly recommended."

Take the bus, it is really hassle free and so much cheaper.Definitely buy your tickets online to avoid the entrance queue. The park is divided into 2 areas: the Waterfront and the Summit.On entering you will see there is a massive queue to go up the mountain (the Summit) with the cable car. You don't need to go up immediately...it is a better idea to explore the waterfront first (at the entrance) as most of the attractions are still empty (like the Panda Bear area). Later the day it gets so crowded that you won't be able to see anything at the enclosure.Then take the underground train to the Summit (you can always take the cable car back down when you are done for the day).The queues can get quite long but the rides are definitely worth the wait. Be prepared to only find Hong Kong theme park fast food unless you go into the restaurants. Be back at the Waterfront before 8pm to see the fountain show...it was one of the highlights and is amazing."

Hong Kong's Ocean Park has the right mix of theme park thrills without over the top schmaltz, plus the bonus of gorgeous animals. Seeing pandas up close is a treat. We'd been there a number of years ago and the mega-aquarium is still a stand-out: in the restaurant with its glass wall to the aquarium it feels like you'e dining underwater! (and I believe there's now an option to sleep there as well). Ocean Park's recent expansion (opened 2012) has added a wonderful Polar Adventure - even the train to get you there is an experience. Best of all, your visit is not lining the pockets of a mega-company. Ocean Park runs as a not-for-profit, so it can support conservation initiatives around the region. Plan to spend the whole day, and enjoy your visit."

Even local Hong Kong natives like us enjoy visiting Ocean Park \u2013 the marine lives are rich and the rides fun; every year in Oct, the whole place turns into a carnival when the Park hosts the Halloween Fest. Last year for the very first time, we took our mom there, hoping she could bask in the blissful ambience and had a taste of the festive feel even though she\u2019s wheelchaired. It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.Ocean Park is huge and hilly. At some points, the slope is almost straight up and down. It\u2019s a lot of work to push a wheelchair around. But the Park is mindful to make their facilities accessible to the disabled. Out of our expectations, my mom was able to do many of the rides, and could even go into the \u201chaunted houses\u201d. There was no priority line. But when we approached the staff checking if it\u2019s possible at all that we did the game, special arrangements were always quickly set up so my mom could cut the line. Inside some of the \u201chaunted houses\u201d, for safety\u2019s sake, they actually held up the normal visitors so my mom (in her wheelchair) could comfortably enjoy the thrill at her own pace. And, a staff was always nearby during the whole process to make sure we didn\u2019t get into troubles. We\u2019re so impressed!!!Not to mention, the \u201cghosts\u201d and \u201cmonsters\u201d parading/ wandering around the park at the open area were all genuinely friendly. They interacted with us, posted for us and with us, and their costumes all looked admirable, with great attention to details. My mom had a wonderful time that day. Big applause to the Park and its staff.The best part is, admission for senior is free!!!I couldn\u2019t recommend the Park more for everyone \u2013 visitors as well as locals, physically fit as well as disabled, kids as well as seniors. Just that in recent years, the Park has been flooded with countless tours (tourists form the Mainland). To beat the crowd, it\u2019s better you go early in the morning or later in the afternoon."

We went to Ocean Park as soon as they opened at 10AM and while towards the end of the day we were worried that we would not have enough time to cover all areas of the park, we managed to pull through.

We tried both of it and it was a great experience. One of their attraction is the Panda. My son really love panda so we didn't missed meeting again the panda. The grand aquarium is also awesome. Food in the restaurants are affordable and yummy. Souvenirs are not so pricey. Tip: First part to visit is the Summit via cable car, queue is not long during morning. Then try the Ocean Express train going down from the Summit. They have a special effect video during the ride."

My 5 year old (112 cm) had much more fun in Disneyland where she was allowed on almost all the rides.The views from cable car are awesome, the queues are very long. Be prepared to walk around. For small children Some things that are worth seeing here are the aquarium, the shows, the cable car, the sky tower, the play area for small children with rides like Frog hopper, merry go round etc.On the other hand if you like roller coasters, this is the place. loved it for them."

There were a large number of cable cars operating so you don't have to worry bout waiting time or sitting awkwardly in one with strangers. We had one all by ourselves (just the two of us)! In average each ride had a 15 min waiting time, which was really reasonable given that my previous amusement parks experience e.g. Universal studio n Disneyland in Japan required more than an hour! There were lots of rides but in general you will even have enough time to repeat some of your favourites. Despite some unpleasant experience with rude mainland Chinese cutting the queue and pushing around, it was a great outing overall. Food was pretty expensive but we brought takeaways from convenient stores and it didn't seem to be an issue. Will be back!"

Along the Exit B walkway is the Tourist Information Service where you can buy discounted entry tickets (HK$310 instead of 345). Or buy ahead from a Seven 11 store. This saves queues at the park entrance if you go on a busy day. If possible avoid weekends and school holidays or you will have to queue for everything. Get there as early as possible, and highly recommend you make straight for the cable car first to take you to the upper area as this just gets busier as the day goes on. Wonderful views on a clear day. We are not into the rides and went to see the animals. All in fantastic environments and kept extremely well. Our favourite were the 2 massive walrus. They were very active and seems to play up to the audience. Don\u2019t miss the underwater exhibit where you get a different perspective of them swimming around. Another highlight is the aquarium, so impressive. Well worth the admission price. The MTR is being extended to here and this will make the journey so much quicker."

Water bottles can be brought in as they have refill H2O stations. small snacks are alot allowed if you don't get caught at the entrance ..haha!!Very fun and educational place, too bad most of the shows are in Cantonese / and Mandarin, ( dolphin shows has English subtitles), the shark / jelly fish aquarium + sea lions was amazing! its like you're a part of them, swimming with them under water! there will be 1 ride which requires raincoat ( unless u dont mind getting wet) so do prepare in advance or be prepared to pay HKD 40 for 1 raincoat ( they allow u to bring ur own)I got my tickets at the MTR ( CENTRAL STATION) for HKD 310 ( which is HKD 35 cheaper! ) then took a bus direct to OCEAN PARK from CENTRAL STATION. ( they have lots of signs so don't worry about being lost, or u can ask around ) buying tickets in advance is to save queuing time at the entrance. get the octopus card which is like a debit card ( prepaid card ) which you can use to take bus/ train/ buy stuff from almost all convenient store."

One important thing to note about Ocean Park is that it is basically two parts which are physically separated by more than 5km. The highland is called the Summit and the lowland is called the Waterfront. First look at the guide map of Ocean Park can be a little intimidating with so many rides and shows to cover.If I were to describe the two parts simply, I would say that the summit comprises of all the High adrenaline super thrilling rides & fantastic shows while the Waterfront section has rides mostly for children and kids. So choose how much time you would like to spend based on your group's age bracket. Also, the rides and shows on the Summit in itself is spread across mountains, which are reached by using a chain of longest escalators ever seem by me!!I think the best strategy to cover Ocean park in a single day is to be highly selective of the rides. Because none of the shows are worth missing. Rides like the Abyss , Hair Raiser, The Flash are a life-time experience. One common feeling was that all rides felt very safe with thorough checks being done by the staff before initiating any ride.Shows like the Dolphin show at Ocean Theatre , Pacific Pier , North Pole, South Pole Sections are very good. My wife was thrilled to see live Penguins for the 1st time in her life. Likewise the dancing Dolphins at Ocean Theater and playful sea-lions, walrus and seals at Pacific Pier. Seeing live sharks of various shapes and sizes through the glass also, raises your hair to see these predators from such a close range. Giant Aquarium at the waterfront is another interesting place. I specially liked the part with a highly magnifying glass , looking through which feels like you are standing in the bottom of the ocean and observing the ocean life.Overall, a must-visit for all age-group with a great collection of rides and shows."

Watching the seals from underneath the water is surely interesting, but there was only one pacific walrus on display which seems so lonely. Too bad the South Pole Spectacular with the penguins was closed on my day of visit. The Arctic foxes look beautiful and am glad they were rescued from a smuggling attempt - their lovely furry coats should stay on them instead of humans.The new ride called \"Hair Raiser\" was very fun but made me dizzy... As for \"the Rapids\", I disliked it as the sole aim of it seems to be getting you wet - they have water guns upstairs for people to shoot at you on purpose! Please bring a raincoat - my jeans were soaked. Not just wet, it was soaked which was obviously uncomfortable for the next hour."

The dolphin ocean performance is a must see! and you also get to see Panda in the park (but most of time they will just keep eating bamboo......). We went during the weekend which was quite busy, 30mins to an hour wait for attractions, but good part is that most of the performance are scheduled which you don't need to wait in line. I got my e-tickets at klook.com , ~15% off. I was really happy I got the e-tickets from them, I only need to scan the QR code on my mobile and enter the park. It saved me 30 mins from waiting at the ticket counter, and not saying it is so much cheaper."

I am wondering why this is ranked 20-odd. it is easily the best attraction in HK IMHO. it is better than Disneyland both in terms of cost as well as entertainment for adults and children alike. it was close to where we were staying and getting here and back was a breeze, even by cab. we reached here in the morning and stepped out only when the park was shutting shop. there was a long queue for the cable car but it was worth it. the car runs along side the sea giving the rider stunning views. at the top, the rides are built around the edges of the cliff making them seem more exhilarating than normal. our favorite ride was Flash but others gave almost the same amount of adrenaline rush. there were options available for food and shops selling knick-knacks. towards the evening, we came to the main area to see the different exhibits as well as the light & sound show (which was quite good). being the time around Christmas, there were decorations all around, making the atmosphere even more cheerful. this was the highlight of our trip!"

They are clearly well cared for and are positioned in a way to ensure maximum visibility.Is a bit difficult to get to from Kowloon in a cab as not all cab drivers are authorised to enter Hong Kong island. So could require a trip on the star ferry if you are staying in Kowloon. We went on the big bus tour the day after visiting Ocean Park and realised that stopped there too.The aquarium and dolphin show was underwhelming to say the least. Not on a par with other big ocean themed theme parks which will remain nameless.Didn't go on any of the rides but they certainly looked good.The gondola from one side of the park to the other is a fantastic experience and the views down across Repulse Bay are unparalleled. The train was not very good and queuing for it was an unorganised mess. Theres only so many times a Chinese person can try and barge past you before you start to become annoyed.Overall I highly recommend Ocean Park - an excellent place to view Pandas and the journey on the cable car is a once in a lifetime experience."

Though Hong Kong is more known for its Disneyland, Ocean park should be a choice if u are travelling without kids...What takes up your attention first are the vibrant colors of the entire place...Everywhere u look around shows an array of warmth and leave you with a happy feeling...An excellent place for both children and adults.. The entry ticket is 345 HKD and could be purchased from the entry gate. However if you want to avoid the crowd the same can be purchased from any hotel or online with a discounted price upto 320 HKD.To reach the place you could take a tube to MTR and then take bus no. 629 or take a taxi directly. The park has 8 theme worlds and what must not be missed are the Grand Aquarium, The polar world, The rain forest, cable car ride to the other side of the hill and a way back through the tunnel in the Ocean express. All rides are free and included in the entry ticket price.There are various souvenir shops inside the park and if you are a collector then it would be better to indulge here than search for the same stuffs outside...Take some of the joy rides if you are in for it...Its also a great learning place for the kids but only that it is really sad to see the Panda sitting all alone and the Sharks and Dolphins in captivity.. SO it might not be an ideal place for animal lovers...There are various eateries inside the park serving mostly cantonese food and Ice creams, Pizza and Mc Donalds for those who would want to try something different.It is advisable to carry water as the day could get tiring...All over a nice place to spend the entire day..."

The Ocean Parc of Hong Kong is a big venue and easy to reach on Hong Kong Island with Bus or Taxi and in some years with MTR as well.The lower part has a lot of attractions and merry go rounds for kids, as well as a big aquarium and 2 Panda enclosures. The Upper part, which is accessible by Cable Car or underground shuttle has Rollercoasters, and other merry go rounds for adults or older children. It as well features a polar world, a dolphin show, a jellyfish aquarium which is very nice. The roller coaster Mining Train looks a little bit soft but has a lot of thrill on the edge of the mountain. As the Ocean Parc always is quite crowded, especially with many visitors from China, make sure to go there as early as possible. If you want to get into an empty Polar world, directly take the shuttle to the upper part and proceed to the Polar World or the Penguin enclosure.For the dolphin Show arrive also 20 min or more early,otherwise it is full. You can also take the back exit all the way down with very long and steep escalators down the mountain to the side facing Aberdeen harbour. If you have an annual pass, you get discounts on all food and beverages if you show the annual pass.I always like to go there with my child and although I have been there many times there is always something new to explore, which you missed before.The Halloween party/fair is a lot of fun and should never be missed!"

Oft overshadowed in terms of popularity by its more famous mouse-centric cousin on Lantau Island, Ocean Park deserves a lot of credit for staying relevant all these years. Following a number of refurbishments, the park is now spread over opposite sides of a mountain connected by a 1.5-kilometre cable car link. There are eight separate themed worlds. Major attractions that shouldn't be missed include the Grand Aquarium in Aqua City and the Giant Panda Adventure where two panda are housed in a climate-controlled enclosure. They do quite a fair bit of wildlife-related shows, including one each featuring birds of prey, sea lions, and dolphins. If amusement park fun is more your cup of tea, almost all of the worlds have rides or games to keep one occupied. All in all, it's good fun for the family but it does take about a day to do reasonable justice during a visit. And for the sheer variety of entertainment found here, it's almost certainly more value for money compared to Disneyland."

Good food stands around old Hong Kong area, at the cable car entrance near the front entrance of the park. Easy to get to the park from Hong Kong by bus."

            "review": "back to childhood. I take my little daughter to Ocean Park every year when in Hong Kong - since she was 2 years old. She still loves it every bit as much as at the beginning - the hoppy frog, bouncy castle, the Pandas and the aquarium in the lower part of the Park, then the cable car up to the hillside part, and the dolphin show. Truth is I enjoy it as much as she does. However, the crowds are getting bigger and bigger, and mainland package tour tourists can be a nuisance when jumping queues or milling around by the hundreds. To beat the queues for the cable car, maybe go first to the hillside part in the morning and then return to visit the lower part. In mid-afternoon, the queues for the cable car back down to the lower part are huge, and waiting times are extremely long. Good that a new MTR line will serve Ocan Park as of July 2015 - that will well shorten the trip and bus drive from Admiralty or Central. Oh, and buy your entrance ticket for Ocean Park at the special counter in Admiralty MTR station - it's a little cheaper there....."

In the intervening years, the Park has developed many new attractions and it remains a fun family day out, particularly for the young and young at heart. You might well need a full day for the lower levels and another full day exploring the attractions at the top of the cable car ride. Although the cost of a full day ticket is reasonable, the price of food and drink inside is very expensive. Apart from going with my grandson, I wanted to see the pandas since they hadn\u2019t been there when I last went. The first trip into their enclosure, they were both asleep, one of them out of sight, but the cute little red pandas were around. We tried again just before we left and one of the pandas obligingly woke up for me, sat down pretty close to where I was standing, and started breaking off bamboos and having dinner in front of me. That alone made it well worth the entry ticket."

Although we expected large crowds there wasn't much! We brought tickets from the MTR shop at the Admiralty station (on the way to the bus stop). They had a 10% discount.Park is huge, hardly can cover in a day. It got both activities and things just to see, like a combination of a theme park and a zoo. Park has two main areas, lower and upper. Cable car ride to the upper section was wonderful. Quite small cable cars but they go really high!The Great Aquarium isn't that great, quite dark and empty inside. Don't spend much time there. Shark Mystique and Polar Adventure is much more interesting. Kids loved watching the playful Seals. Rainforest section is great but the Rapids was closed on that day!There are many extreme rides which are not for small children. We watched the Dolphin show at the Ocean Theatre. Just an ordinary show, nothing much (try to sit in the shade, sun can really burn you!). Ride the Ocean Park Tower for great views of the park. Also don't forget to watch the dancing fountain in the Aqua Lagoon when lit up, amazing to watch.Arrangement of the park is bit confusing and can get lost very easily. Better spend some time studying the map, if lost have to walk back a long way!We had our lunch at the Bay View Restaurant, sadly food was terrible!This is a huge park which need more than one day to fully enjoy."

With all due respect, I have to disagree. We went on a Saturday and it was busy, but I am sure it gets busier than we experienced looking at other reviews. The park is a mixture of a tiny zoo crossed with a thrill seeker theme park. There were one or two pandas that were amazing, and a few other animals and a large aquarium. The seal feeding shows were brilliant as were the dolphin shows. Apart from this, the rest was rather disappointing! I think this park would have been better split into two with the animals in one area and the rides in another, rather than mixed together. The park really should look at limiting the number of people allowed to enter at once as the pushing and shoving is a real problem. To be honest, this seemed to be the norm in Hong Kong and seemed to be carried out by mainly Chinese mainland visitors and locals. Being a place frequented by children, I thought this behaviour was despicable and people should be ashamed of themselves. Food in the park is overpriced for what it is. There is a small McDonalds inside but they don't do combos, you have to order everything separate; a clear money making exercise. Close to these eateries there are a number of sideshow alley type of games, and the constant yelling and screaming over loudspeakers becomes unbearable after a while. If you are strapped for time, go to Disneyland as they have a better atmosphere than Ocean Park, the food is better as is the enjoyment levels. If you have a Royal Show/Carnival setup in your country, this is no different to what you could experience at home at a much cheaper rate."

Ocean Park is a government funded theme park/mini-zoo/aquariums/scenic cable car ride. It is a little bit of everything.Lately they are building an MTR rail station next to it so hopefully this should be up and running within the next year or so. To visit you must either drive there and park or take the bus from places like Admiralty mtr. The ocean park website is quite good with all this info.Visit in the off peak. Avoid around Chinese national holidays at all costs. The swarms of Chinese tourists will scare you. Visit the red panda enclosure for cuteness. Visit the shark enclosure for beauty as well as the jellyfish house.Must try the cable car on a good day. It is built on the edge of the mountains by the sea!Try Hair raiser, it is pretty scary with several loops. The water ride is cute too.Don't expect Disney or 6 Flags branding big corporate park. It is still very local so manage your expectations.Tip: Bring water and water bottles for topping up. Food is super expensive inside so bring food too. Fruit is not allowed to be brought in IF they check your bags.Enjoy yourself! :)"

If HK school is in session then the park will be fairly empty and enjoyable in the morning but will still get crowded and much less pleasant as the day passes.It's definitely worth a trip and along with the science museum would be in my top 2 for Hong Kong with kids. If you ride the gondola down in the afternoon/late afternoon you will see the fishing boats coming back into harbour, which is quaint."

Having been to Disneyland in California only 4 months prior, we decided to try Ocean Park over Disneyland HK (which we had been told was more suited to little children). We found Ocean Park to be very clean, easy to get around, very short wait time for rides and it had plenty to offer by way of rides and other attractions. We started by seeing the Pandas, which was a great experience and you can get much closer than we had expected. We then took the bullet train (maybe 2-3 mins) to the other side of the park and did that area first up. There were a few rides our children were a little young for (but probably other kids would be fine with them), but plenty they loved. We watched the dolphin water show which we found to be pretty slow and not that engaging, but it seemed to appeal greatly to the Asian viewers so perhaps we missed something in the translation. We then took the cable car back to the other side which we would definitely recommend. Views are terrific and the ride is just long enough (maybe 15 minutes) to keep the kids happy. The food was very basic (hot dog was really the best we could find), so we probably should of taken a few snacks/fruit with us. Drinks/water was readily available for purchase. The entry fee for 2 adults and 2 children was very cheap and included all rides and experiences. Only mistake we made was not getting the hotel to book a car to pick us up at the end of the day as the line for a taxi was horrendous and took over 1 hour. Talking to staff whilst waiting for the taxi that is standard, so would definitely recommend arranging for a car to collect you."

Meet and greet different sea creatures - from walrus to sea horses to sting rays...wide array of fish.They also have 2 pandas - too bad the big fat creature was sleeping when we were there.Do not miss the dolphin show, it was fun especially for kids.The cable car - stunning view!The only thing i didnt like is the \" no food allowed\" policy. When you get inside, your bags will be inspected and you eould not be admitted if you have food. Whats worse, the food inside is too expensive and not that great. I hope they can make modification with this. I think you can bring crackers- not too big though and place it at the bottom of your bag.

We purchased our tickets from China Travel Service (They have several locations in HK) the morning of our day trip to Ocean Park. It was $272.00 HKD compared to $320.00 at the gate or online. LOCATION/VENUE: You'll have to catch a bus from Admiralty station. This costs $10.20 HKD/pp each way. The park was generally clean but you'll have park camera crew encouraging you to buy the pictures they took of you almost at every ride and entrance. They even already put your pictures in a frame, snowglobes, and keychains so that you will want to buy it. A waste of paper and time, i felt. RIDES: I was hoping for more thrilling rides but after you've been to places like Six Flags, the Ocean Park rides will seem boring. They do have a lot of activities, rides, and game areas for kids though so it's really more family oriented. Honestly the most exciting \"ride\" in the whole park is the cable card ride with the view of the island. TIPS: - Arrive early. We arrived around 10:30am and enjoyed peace and quiet but after lunch, it was way way crowded and felt like a circus... and this was on a weekday. - BRING YOUR OWN FOOD! Unless you don't mind getting less and paying triple the price."

Prices are also as expensive as Disneyland but I got lucky when I've bought a pillow neck when the cashier told me that they having a promo discount from their items. Food is good, there is a mcdonalds inside only bad part is that when crowded there are not enough to sit and take a rest. Watch schedule shows as means for a quick stop which is great too. Facilities are good and clean and more organized than Disneyland in terms of queuing."

We timed it well by being there around 10.30 and feeding time and saw the most gorgeous Panda having his meal. There were a few people around but gets a lot busier as the day goes on. It is a huge park and would highly recommend for families with so much to do. We didn't plan on taking any rides but took the cable car across the park. Well worth it, The views were amazing and a surprising find. We could see back into Repulse Bay and the beach areas and right out to the Ocean with all the ships. That is all we did as we were not planning on do anything other than the Panda's but would recommend highly the cable cars. Great theme park for families"

But about 20 years ago and after a large amount of expansion, it is now mostly a tourist attraction. Locals tend to stay away to aovid the crowd. It of course has a lot of attraction for the tourists:- large aquarium, water shows by seals and killer whale, pandas, penguins, roller-coasters and other games, gardens and restaurants. And of course, one of the longest escalators in Asia.Actually, the park itslef is quite large. But due to shear number of tourists that are arriving everyday, it is always packed. If you must go, go early to aovid the crowd and get a better chance of getting ride on one of those games, or getting a table at the restaurants.One last word of advice, buy your ticket beforehand to avoid queing up at the entrance. Moreover, bring along some cash because each entrance ticket costs more than HK$ 300, but it includes rides on the cable cars and shows, etc."

The problem is that, I wonder if that has made the owners/managers complacent. The Pandas are amazing. Their habitats allow visitors to get a great view and some fantastic photos to wow friends and family back home. Just make sure you visit them in the morning, as by the afternoon they're more likely to be asleep.The food we had was expensive and cold.I wouldn't normally be that bothered, but how hard is it to get curly fries right?!The Hair Raiser rollercoaster is great, but far from the best of its type. Slow operations mean queues move much slower than they should. That said, the cliff top location of the rides does go quite a long way to counter-act their lacklustre ride-ability. Ocean Kingdom just across the border on the mainland pretty much does the same thing, but much better. Apart from the Pandas (and geographical location), I can't think of a compelling reason to choose Ocean Park over its brand new competitor."

However, this trip was very disappointing and has put me off from ever returning again. We were a family of 5 and spent $1585 on the tickets. The purpose of our visit was mainly for the theme park rides. However, 5 of the main rides were closed for scheduled maintenance. 2 other attractions were closed. Out of the rides we did go on (Hair Raiser, the Flash and the Abyss) they were definitely not for thrill seekers and below standard (very slow). None of the water rides were open and one main restaurant we wanted to go to was also closed. The food we bought there was extremely expensive and below standard. We also visited the panda enclosure and dolphine marine centre and all left disheartened as the enclosures are very small and not well kept (e.g. the dolphin pool was very murky). If you're going to Ocean Park with young children, it may be an enjoyable day. I would also recommend checking the sign at the front of the entrance to see if any rides are closed. Unfortunately we bought our tickets beforehand at Admiralty station, and wouldn't have gone if we have known all the main rides were closed. Having spoken to the staff upon leaving they refused to offer any sort of compensation."

There were not many people on the day we attended (probably due to the wet weather and weekday visit) so this made the lines fairly short and manageable. Lots to do and lots of fun - I would recommend as an alternative to Disneyland.

Then you go out and take bus 629. First buy the ticket (around 10 HKD), you will not miss it because everybody will be staying in the line for the bus. It will take 3 minutes to get to the Park by bus. Take some food and some water with you, but you also can find different cafes and take away-s. Enjoy! Definitely its worth visiting.

If you want to do rides you probably need two days here. I just enjoyed watching the animal shows and looking at exhibits.

Our family of 2A and 2 teenagers visited Ocean Park in Dec 2014 and we had a great time with everyone enjoy their own bits of the park. My younger daughter really liked animals so the panda, penguins, sharks, sea lions, artic fox, etc. were great for her. The older one enjoyed the rides and the shows so we watched the Emperor of the sky bird show in the morning and Ocean Wonder show at 3:30pm. For my wife and I, we enjoyed the cable car ride and also the snacks at the Tuxedo Restaurant. Tip #1: Pick up a HK Map at the airport or hotel. There is a coupon in the Map that gets you entry discount and also additional meal vouchers.Tip #2: Try to get to the park early as there are many tourists and the queue for the cable car gets extremely long from lunch time. Consider taking the Ocean Express train up to the upper area attractions and then take the cable car down as the queue is shorter on the other side. You can travel up and down to visit different attactions and shows.Tip #3: Don't miss the tuxedo restaurant next to the Penguin/South Pole Spectacular. The entrance looks a bit intimidating but it well worth to wait a get a table. You can to dine with the penguins. (We ate there twice - simple lunch and then tea break). The resturant is a bit cold due to the penguins but the soup and pasta were great :)Tip #4: Don't miss the White Artic Fox - the attraction is only accessible via the shop after the South Pole/Penguin view and many people miss it. Tip #5: On holidays, be at the shows venue at least 20 minutes early to get good seats."

Cable Cars are a must as they offer such a beautiful view, as well as take you up to the main part of the theme park where majority of the rides and roller coasters are. Not a fan of aquariums, however this one is amazing and is a must see! Whole family absolutely loved it and we spent quite a bit of time there. Lines weren't too bad, our longest wait was around 30 mins and everything else was shorter then that.

Fairly expensive to get in (but luckily we got discounted tickets). Easy to get there using public transport. It is set on two levels with a cable car for transportation between the 2 sites. Everywhere was clean, tidy and relaxed (apart from the queue to get in 1st thing in the morning - when the barriers went up there was a stampede - no orderly queuing that us Brits normally expect and actually it was quite frightening ! e.g. adults knocking children over in their rush to get to the cable cars !! but after spending 5 weeks in HK we got used to that ). Compared to UK theme parks, it is small but that is exactly what I like about it, that and the pandas ! A good variety of places to eat and gorgeous views. I was travelled with adults but my family would have loved it and if I ever return to HK I would visit there again."

By the afternoon (after 1pm) the park got crazy busy so it was good that we got there at 10am.Highlights for me were the pandas and monkeys in the Hong Kong Jockey Club Sichuan Treasures - we nearly didn't even go in as didn't know what it was but were incredibly glad we did.

The rides are just one of the best, the cable car's view is just amazing and the park's animal showcase is just impressive (READ PANDA). The park may have some major let downs as well like the almost rundown carts and rides and also the food choices are quite limited. But it will surely be one heck of a day here! Just make sure you don't visit here during holidays cause that's our major mistake! took hours for each attraction cause of the heavy queue!"

We had snacks with us and she gave us a warning and told us that next not to bring food. This is dumb and it forces you to pay for their food inside. And we are vegetarians!! But we ate our food in there anyway lol- Very crowded in the afternoon with people screaming and shouting and shoving especially when the tours start to arrive.- a couple of attractions were closed which was disappointing (penguins, some rides) Tips:- as people have mentioned before- and i took the advice and had a great time and did everything- go on a week day, you should arrive at opening and take the cable car straight to the summit. If you love an adrenalin rush finish thrill mountain first. Then finish everything else up there then go back down later (there isn't much down there anyway) we finished almost everything (leisurely) in about 8 hours - choose a cloudy day (thankfully luck was on our side) because if the sun is out it will be way to hot walking from one section to the other.

My wife and I went to Ocean Park on our last visit to HK which was almost two years ago and this was a Herculean task for me as I have advanced Parkinson's Disease which greatly affects my mobility. We were extremely impressed by the stability of the cable cars (with a little help from mother nature) and the panoramic view was a pleasant surprise as we often think of HK as a concrete jungle and it is a pleasure to the eyes and a solace to the spirit to see rolling hills and verdant valleys underneath our feet.I made a wish to myself that I can be back around Halloween as part of Ocean Park will be transformed into a land of ghouls, vampires, zombies and other hideous creatures of the night, not to mention that there are several haunted houses with different themes to choose from, perfect for a ghost story aficionado like myself. Before I go on, we must thank Mr. Allan Zeman, former CEO of Ocean Park, for making all these and more possible. Having strolled around the park for over an hour, I knew that my legs were starting to slow down and I had to hang on to the benches for support. We finally made our way to the Neptune's Restaurant which was not due to open in another ten minutes. We waved down a passing server and asked if we could at least be seated due to my condition but he insisted that the kitchen staff and servers were not ready. For crying out loud, all that I need was table and chairs and they could start serving me whenever their royal highness were ready. This server was obnoxious, arrogant and insensitive to the extreme and since our verbal exchange was not serving any purpose other than providing free entertainment to passer-by, I struggled back to the front gate and left. Although I have never been a big fan of Disneyland despite my love for Micky and the gang, they definitely have much better facilities and transportation for people like myself."

The rides are quite distant from each other so beware - wear the most comfortable sports shoes ( you can give fashion a break for a day). The Cable Car is a marvel it gives you a look of the entire park. And the alternative to that is the mini train both are good in their own sense. My suggestion use both of them on either way. The rides are good and strategically placed the Dragon ride, the Abyss, The Mine Train were my favourites. There's also a grand aquarium at the entrance of the park, probably, 10 times bigger than the one in Singapore and much much better. They even let you touch the egg of a baby shark! What more can you want? Really a nice place. If you want to tickle the adventurous genes within you then Ocean Park is the right place for you.The only thing that I found missing was the water coolers ; you could find one in Disneyland after every 50 feets or so. Not so much of a drawback but I personally felt it so thought to mention it."

During first two hours, most attractions have waits of 5-10 minutes or less.* Take the train to go up to the Summit first thing in the morning and the cable car to return to the waterfront area in early afternoon. This way, you are working against the crowds/traffic. We did not have to wait in any line using this method, whereas the line for cable cars going to the Summit from the waterfront was very long (waits exceeding 45 minutes).* Visit on a weekday to avoid crowds. Mainland Chinese converge on Ocean Park on weekends, particularly Sundays.* If you are staying at a hotel, it is well worth the extra money to have the hotel pick you up in their car from Ocean Park. The taxi line is very long with some people reporting waits of over an hour. Having a car pick you up and bypass the long lines can make a big difference in making your visit a positive one.* Be prepared for a lot of uphill walking. Since the Summit area is literally built into the side of a mountain, you are forever climbing steps. It is a workout! The views though are fantastic."

Although the ticket prices are reasonable- that's the end of the bargain. The cost of extras is not. For example, the food, other than the restaurants, is dreadful- no really, bought cheap and sold at a premium I guess. Furthermore, try finding a seat. Other than food, Disneyland pays attention to detail, down to the light fittings- Ocean Park is an array of bodge it displays. Okay, my son prefers OP, but hey, he doesn't have to pay.

If travelling with kids, they have excellent kiddies ride and great access to a lot of Asian animals, including Panda's.I would recommend eating at the cafe up the top of the mountain where you get off the cable car.

To avoid queues for the cable car I recommend going straight to the cable car and getting it up to the summit, then use the train to return to the waterfront later in the day.Highlights for us were the rapids ride, the mine train ride, the penguins, pandas and the bird show.We also had a giggle when we noticed some older chinese people taking pictures of us randomly - I don't think they'd seen white people before! =)Beware of tourists from mainland China, we found them to be very rude and they would just push in front of us in the queues... after getting mad at first we just learnt to take deep breaths and ignore it!"

I always enjoy looking at the animal exhibits, which are highlights of Ocean Park. I would advise tourists to take the Ocean express to the Headlands and then the Cable Car back, as you would want to beat some tourists to the best rides. Thrill Mountain is more crowded than other areas, because it is newer and more popular. Best to go there first and make your way down to the other attractions. Food quality is okay, but it IS getting expensive; Cafe Ocean is a decent sit-down restaurant with affordable prices! Other kiosks such as Pizza Place offers quick bites which are cheaper than other kiosks too.Shows are good for animal lovers, but if you're short on time the Ocean Theatre Show is probably most worth your money. Favourite ride is the Hair Raiser; plenty of roller coasters and water rides for young adults and teens to have fun on!For souvenirs, the biggest shop is in Aqua City underneath the Grand Aquarium, so go there if you want sea-themed merchandise. The night show Symbio is great; it is water show with some fire effects and minimal fireworks, so stay for it if you aren't too tired.Overall, another excellent visit to the park; enjoyed the thrill, and can't wait to go back soon! It's well worth your $320."

We were staying on the island so we caught the MRT to Admiralty and came out at exit B which is directly in front of the bus stop for bus 629 that takes you directly to the front entrance of Ocean Park in around 15-25 minutes (depends on traffic). As you walk from the train to exit B you pass a tourist centre that sells the park entrance tickets. They were actually selling them for HK$290 which is 30 less than at the park. This also saved us time lining up to buy tickets too. The bus pulls up right at the front of the park and you take the big domed escalators up and start lining up.There's a good blend of animal exhibits and rides across the park. We only caught the ocean animal show and it was okay, some dolphins and sea lions. As per all themed parks food was more expensive in there. There's a variety of places to eat at including restaurants to McDonalds. Be ready for lots of walking and some great photos, especially the view from the gondolas."

But I am not complaining. The thrill rides are what bring the tourists back again and again. Do take the cable car ride to the top of the mountain and then take a train back down. The aquarium is one of the best attractions there although it can be very crowded. They are building a MTR station near Ocean Park. Looks like it can be completed soon. It may be a good idea to wait for its completion. Taking a bus to the park means can be stuck in traffic jams."

Looking at the previous reviews and suggestions from past visitors on the TA forum we went in exactly in reverse. We straight away took the cable car and went on the top of the park and started completing all the roller coasters and thrill rides one by one. We would complete one area of the park and then hit another and so on, before we completed everything and took a train back to the bottom and completed the rest. Compared to Disney Land, Ocean park is definitely more geared towards teens and adults with its adventure and thrill rides, while Disney is definitely for the kids.It was a good experience overall. The dining options, apart from McDonalds were average and limited."

We met Santa, took many nice pics. The aquarium and sea things are very big. My 5th year old is very excited to see Nobita character. Even they have small house for Doraemon and friends. For those who like to come and do not like queuing I suggested not to come on holiday season. So you will see and enjoy more. Spend your time from morning till evening here and it's fun! My suggestion for Ocean park management is they should put more signage with details rather than asked us to read the map by ourselves."

The park is big and the 2 main must do items is the cable car ride (15 minutes) and the dolphine show (about 20 minutes). These 2 become the signature of those who visit the park. However be ready for the crowd of these 2 items especially the dolphine show.The cable car allows you to have an overview of not only the park but surrounding waters and hills. However the view is scondary but it is the ride that is thrilling as it travels up and down at a steep gradient which we have never experienced excpet on mountain train in Switzerland.At the main entrance, be ready to queue to buy the tickets but to avoid, you can purchase the tickets on line. Be expect to spend a day here if you have kids."

The rides were a blast that I ended up in one of the clinics but I had fun.HOW TO GET THERE: Take MTR to Admiralty Station and walk towards Admiralty Bus Terminus. Take Bus 629, and it will take you the Ocean Park for 25 minutes depending on the flow of traffic. However, the last time we were there, there was a temporary rerouting of the buses. Instead of Admiralty, we took Bus 629 in Tin Hau. It's best to be updated on the traffic routes. You can use your Octopus Card for your fare payment. If not, pay in exact amount because they will not give any change at all. HIGHLIGHTS:- It is more interactive compared to Hong Kong Disneyland. Of course, each is unique on its own.- There are live animals such as Pandas and Penguins to amuse watchers. Live shows are performed at designated places and time. - There are more thriller rides within the Park. Try The Flash and The Hair Raiser if you want the thrill of your life. - There are less nerve- wrecking rides within the park such as the the carousel, the Ferris wheel, the mini train.- There are food shops along the area, and less expensive compared to Disneyland. - There are also games to play so that you could win Ocean Park goodies and stuff toys. You can play for HKD30.00 or HKD50.00. - Every area has a theme and highlight. It's recommended if you could visit the Park for 1- Day- There are souvenir shops in every area. It's less expensive compared to Disneyland. You can buy keychains for HKD30.00, Plushies for HKD80.00, Ref Magnets for HKD40.00, Ballpens for 2 HKD50.00 and many more items to choose from. - The park closes at 7PM. If you want to avoid the long queues of the Cable Car if you're on the upper part of the Park, leave ahead. We waited for almost 1 Hour before we got into the Cable Car. There is also the Ocean Express to accommodate during the early hours.- There First Aid/Clinic was good and very comfortable. I was able to rest well, and it was clean. - There are so many people in the park. If you don't want the crowds, then this is not for you. Sometimes, people are rude, they end up pushing you!"

The cable car ride alone between the two sides of the park was worth the price of admission. Just amazing views everywhere.We got to the park 15 min after its 10 am opening and it was empty. We started at the panda exhibit and it was amazing - our first time to see these animals. Very active.After a couple more exhibits we took the cable cars across the island ... which was a good move as the line was very long at 1 PM as we were leaving. If you don't like heights, beware! The cars feel very safe but it's a long way down.The rides are clearly for the older kids (vs Disney) but our 6 and 7 year old still had a lot to do. They loved the shark exhibit - we spent a lot of time watching them circle the tank. My 2 year old son loved the rainforest section - the colorful birds caught his eye.Our children demanded McDonald's, which is by the Shark building. There is no immediate seating but if you go to the right and continue past McDonald's then you will get to a beautiful path with a wide stone wall. It's a perfect setting for a lunch overlooking the ocean.I would carve out a day for this - high quality, a great price performer and enjoyable!"

As ever, this venue is a very popular place and the entry fee was good value. We loved the skycars because it crosses from one side of the mountain to the other, passing some breathtaking views of the sea and greenery. The rides are designed for kiddies, mostly circa 7- 14 year age group. They're designed for fun rather than thrills. The queues were not excessively long, but please do remember that at busy periods, this place is flooded by tour groups and lots of Chinese (non local) tourists whom have no sense of respect for queuing and will have no hesitation in cutting straight through everybody!Especially nice are the pandas and goldfish. The views are breathtaking and looks out to the expanse of the sea. The food is horrendous. Avoid the sausage (all varieties and from whichever stall it is sold)... I don't know what's in it, but to me it wreaks of badly recycled old grease and the locals (unlike the mainland chinese) wouldn't touch them with a barge pole! Please also to bring walking shoes... The park has some seriously undulating hills and inclines and if you go with a stroller like us, there are detours designed for wheels but these are snake like and very long paths. Overall, good park- ignore the rush and push of other tourists and your kids will come out smiling like ours. 7/10"

Spectacular views from the cable car, you think you are just going up the mountain and once at the top you discover there is another Mountain beyond and your journey continues. Once at the top, spectacular views and a huge theme park. Ocean Park is like 5 theme parks in one, Aquarium, Seals, Penguins, Roller Coasters, Thrill Rides, Etc. We came for a day and decided to stay until close at 9pm and wished we had another day to explore more, too much to get around in one day. A definite must to visit for the young at heart and the kids. Far better than any theme park we have visited in Australia and we live on the Gold Coast, so have seen them all.

So the best thing to do before beginning your adventure is to roughly plan out the attractions and areas you want to visit. The aquarium is pretty impressive especially when you realize how huge the central tank is, though I was more captivated with an entire section devoted to various beautiful varieties of gold fishes. The poles where the penguins live are quite cool too, sadly the polar bear section was closed for maintenance during my visit. A visit to the panda sanctuary is probably one of the standard check-boxes you should have on your list, though the dolphin show is a bit of a letdown as it was nothing too spectacular and you might give that a pass. There are a few interesting rides for the thrill seekers, though you shouldn\u2019t miss the light show at the fountain at the end of the day to complete a memorable outing."

Since this is my 3rd trip (2nd one with my kids), we were better at planning how to spend our time. Make sure you have a map of the park in hand. You can get it when you buy the ticket at the park counter or as you go in at the kiosk located on the left hand side of the entrance.My advice is to take the cable car rides first because if you choose to take the cable car ride back at the end of the day, trust me the queue would be very very long. We opted to take the Express train back instead.Rides were better suited for kids of ages 10 and above. If you have younger children, choose Disneyland instead. My kids even queued up twice for some of the rides. Though it was our 2nd trip, we left the park at 6.30pm to beat the crowd. On that day, park was closed at 7pm.TIP : YOU CAN GET DISCOUNTED TICKETS THROUGH CTS HONG KONG. THEY WILL ISSUE YOU THE PARK TICKETS WHICH ARE VALID FOR 3-4 WEEKS SO YOU CAN USE THEM ANYTIME YOU WISH."

Tickets were purchased online as a discounted rate and no issues getting in (just need to show the printed barcode). We started at the lower levels but if you have been to other zoos/aquariums, this is only average. 'Tis much better to head straight to the queue for the cable car to the Summit where all the cool rides are. We tried a few of them twice in a row, although for some there is a long walk between one roller-coaster to the other. As for the \"pushy\" Chinese tourists, this is more for the tamer rides/exhibits - the wilder rides are mostly for the younger generation, so no issues with those. We can see a MTR station being constructed across the entrance (almost completed) so transportation should be way easier in the future (currently MTR followed by bus 629)..."

The average wait time was around 5-15mins (bumper cars was around 20min). We got there around 10:15, bought tickets and went in around 10:30. Took the cable car up to the Summit where we headed straight for the dragon ride, however upon arrival they were still 'testing' the ride. We waited there because they said it should be ready in another 5-10mins. We probably ended up waiting for 20 just to be told it's still not ready so we ended up going for some other rides.Overall it was a pretty good day except for the fact that it seems to be on every Visit-HK-From-China tour. Suffice to say there was a lot of 'pushing in line', 'pushing you from behind' and 'bumping into you' incidents the whole day. Good to knows: There's no bringing food into the park - they will check your backpacks and would turn you away IF they find it in your bag. Water bottles should be fine - I brought in mine.Go to the summit first, there's more rides up there and more food choices (McDonalds is located up there but the prices are higher than outside prices). Also remember to watch the dolphin/seal's performance while you are up there.If you don't want to be pushed or shoved on the connecting train, take the cable car. However the wait time would be longer."

There are SO MANY Chinese tour buses with OLD people that it really detracted from getting around and enjoying the park. There I said it. We spent half the time trying to stay ahead of the Chinese tours because once they came to a section they flooded it and really caused chaos. Case in point-we were in the jelly fish exhibit and just as we got in 60 + senior mainlanders on a tour came swooping through and just ruined the experience for my family. This happened time and time again. Not only seniors, but adults were all over the place-hardly any kids or kids with families. Really odd feeling theme park. I would save my money.

We reached the park at about 10:30 am and decided to go straight to the summit part of the park through the cable car. Surprisingly, at this point we just had to wait for 5 minutes. My 6 years old daughter enjoyed this ride. Upon reaching the summit, you need to do a lot of walking and there are all types of rides. My husband enjoys the thrill and sat on the hair raiser and some other dangerous looking rides while I waited with my daughter. The wait times were not much due to the nature of these rides. But for all the other simpler rides the queues were extremely long - we skipped many of them just by looking at the queues with approximate waiting time of over 30-40 minutes. The dolphin show was alright (but not as good compared to the one at Singapore Santosa). My daughter enjoyed it and so that's fine. The penguin enclosure was good and we enjoyed looking at them - but it was quite cold inside and thankfully we were all carrying extra jackets. The jelly fish aquariums were also cool. Overall, we skipped a lot of stuff at the summit due to the queues - we then decided to go down through the train which was quick and without much wait time. The bird show at the park was pretty lame - Jurong bird park in Singapore was way better. There were two other shows at the whiskers theater (in cantonese) - they were also very lame and gave me a headache. But our daughter seemed to enjoy those too. There is a play area for kids (which you can find at any public park) - many other games (costing 10$ per coin) - which we avoided. The panda enclosure was okay but we did not get a good view of the giant panda. We were not able to visit the grand aquarium due to the loooong queue. There are more eating options at the summit, so it's better to eat there rather than coming down. All the better attractions were at the top - so it would make sense to spend more time there. You can easily skip all the shows and see only the dolphin one."

The bad thing was trying to get back to our hotel by taxi. We waited 2.5 hours on the taxi rank in the rain along with masses of other people trying to get home. The park management should look to liaising with the taxi company to improve the service. My advice is to take an organized bus tour if you want to get back to your hotel at a reasonable time.

I loves the design that some part of the floor is transparent and you can actually see the penguins swimming underneath. And cable car ride was not to be missed, the view was magnificent but beware on the long queue. Best to take it at the beginning and back using the faster sea train.Also love the show of seals and dolphins as now it was more about conservation and education rather than forcing the animals to entertain the audience.Do allow more time to stay in the park ( preferably a whole day) especially in weekends as there are many group tours and the queues can be very long.

If you want to see those, note beforehand the location of the exhibits, or else you will waste time walking to a building that turns out to be a ride. We went to see the pandas too. The pandas turned out to sleep a lot, so be prepared to see nothing, lest you be disappointed. There are two different panda exhibits. Many people line up at the first one at the Jockey Club Sichuan Treasures. The pandas were sleeping inside their dens. The other panda exhibit is at the Amazing Asian Animals exhibit.

This is a huge park spread over a large area and you have to take a shuttle or the sky cars to get over the hill to the other areas. Be careful if you have issues walking....it is not going to be an easy day.Food was very expensive and not very good."

The cable car ride, with its steep drops was scream-inducing, vertigo-causing awesomeness. The main aquarium is small compared to that in Singapore but the rides certainly made up for it.The MTR station that will take you directly to Ocean Park is currently being constructed. As for now, you'll need to take bus 629 from Admiralty station. It really is not an issue but do take note that the park closes at 7PM and there's going to be a long line to get on bus 629 during that time. Tip: do not go there on weekends as there are long lines for every ride and you won't be able to maximize your time there."

Most people seem to head for the cable car upto the higher level attractions but suggest that you don't do that instead head to the panda enclosure they are generally being fed and are active and there are no crowds. Things will have quietened down and you can get around the other exhibits once you have exhausted your interest in the pandas. take in a dolphin/seal show in the afternoon also fascinating is the jellyfish exhibit."

Get there at 9.30 before it opens and remember your ID card if you are a resident as significant discount available during certain months. 2. leave before 2pm as it fills up in the afternoon.3. Bring sun block and hard cash for playing games as not that many cash machines in the park. The food is what you would expect so bring fruit if you want to counter balance the inevitable.4. Run like everyone else to the cable car upon entry and get to the main area up the mountain. The queues get crazy.5. Use the ocean express to get down to the exit instead of the cable car- it's cool and less queues.6. Consider booking one of the restaurants at 1 island south which is a 3 min walk away (we went to GCX)7. Check the height restrictions for rides. The staff are very strict (as they should be) and this can lead to tears if expectations have been set.8. Use the escalator to get to the mining ride and river rapid."

Well organized, modern, and accessibility make it appealing for a day trip with young ones. Want to ease the stress - go early, pack snacks, and plan an agenda. Too many opportunities for aimless wandering due to ambiguous signage.Avoid the crowds by taking the cable car to the far side of the park when you arrive, and work your way back to the near side after lunch. You'll find this much more pleasant and avoid the inevitable queues. What struck me that it was primarily adults in the park - bus loads of them. See the pandas, take a sweater for the penguin exhibit, and go to kids world for a ride on the carrousel. Children will have a wonderful time."

So what can we do on a rainy day here? 1) visit the aquarium - the aquarium was moderately sized, complete with sufficient sea animals for variety. What I do not like is the entrance where the entire queue is diverted to a photo point and even though you do not want it, just got to pose and get it over with before the staff lets you in. The aquarium 's design is nothing special but good enough if it is your first visits to its kind.2) visit the pandas - there are two enclosures, one with aging pandas. When we were there, the pandas were asleep in a separate enclosure so it was a wasted trip. The one with the younger pandas is open, and you get to see red pandas as well3) visit the crocodiles - can o lay see from a small view port4) visit the goldfish - I never know they are so many kinds of gold fishes5) visit the birds - I did not go there6) visit a children theme park - the 3 rides are open if you don't mind getting wet. There are also some other paid games which I do not fancy trying under the rain7) take the cable car to the summit - the theme park is split into two, one at the foot of the hill and the other at the summit. I did not go up but from the map it looks like it's a theme park for older kids. I have no idea why this place is named ocean park since the aquarium probably takes up about 2% of the park area. Apart from the adherence to the theme, I would still recommend a visit here since you get everything in one place. I believe the experience would have great if not for the rain. By the way, if you do not want to queue at the theme park for the tickets, they are also available from 7-11. After purchasing, you will be issued with a thermal paper based tickets which can be scanned at the turnstile for access into the theme park. I understand that one of the mtr station sells the tickets as well, and cheaper. Forgotten which one is it, you can probably check with the hotel's concierge."

You are just expected to line up and somehow convince your kids that 90 minutes is not so long!Absolutely impossible with young children. Besides, the park is really lacking in rides suitable for 4-9 year olds. There is a small kids zone for 1-3 year olds and then a few great looking rides for 9/10+, but for kids in between you're left with an Aquarium (which is very good), the cable car ride itself (fabulous) and an abundance of pay & play fairgroundgames (but with most being $50 a pop you will soon be doubling the high cost of the entrance fee if you partake!)Also be well aware that there are only 2 ways down from The Summit (via cable car or train) and both had a 60min wait from 15:00 onwards.Not the nicest way to finish off a day queuing - effectively having to queue to leave!(an impressive fire, water and music show on the way out at closing time somewhat helps you to leave with half-a-smile on your face, but it's not enough to compensate what was an extreme let-down)I would say the park is well worth a visit off-peak, but in our case, it was a frustrating day spent in and out of queues and really was a waste of time, energy and money."

Took bus 629 from Tin Hau MTR station - note because of the protests in Admiralty the buses go to and from there, not Admiralty station - so check before you go.They check your bags for food when you enter the park, as outside food is not allowed. However, the checks are not as stringent as those at the airport. So use your discretion what to do. The food inside is expensive and unimpressive. I believe there's a McDonald's there but again they are more expensive.Ocean park is divided into two parts - the waterfront and the summit. The two are connected by the cable car or the ocean express train. We went on a week day and there was a 5 min queue for the train to the summit and a 20 min queue for the cable car at around 12.30pm. We had used the cable car on previous visits so took the train to save time. However we would recommend taking the cable car if you have not done it before - the views are great - and make sure you see it in daylight.Pick up a show schedule at the entrance and plan your day accordingly. You would want to do everything in the summit whilst you are at the summit - you will need to come back to the waterfront to leave the park though. Make sure you don't leave it too late to come back down. The queue for the cable car down at 5pm was around 45 min. Everyone would be doing the same after 6pm so don't expect that there's much time for seeing things once you get back down to the waterfront. We did see the pandas at 6.30pm - no queue at all and there were about 5 people in the building.Bring a poncho if you don't want to get your clothes wet - you will do with some of the rides.Whilst in the summit you can take the escalator down to adventure land, or take a short walk. If you walk down you can see, and get close to, some baby Dolphins in the mammal centre.Make sure you see the Dolphins and penguins in the summit, and the pandas in the waterfront - they are the highlight of the park apart from the rides and views. The ocean theatre is great, with clever Dolphins and sea lions. You will see the ocean right beyond the theatre when you watch the show - don't miss it.You can easily spend a whole day in ocean park, if not more! For me, the staff are very helpful there. They could smile a little bit more in my in opinion. They are very used to mainland Chinese queue jumping and if you see any of that happening, don't be afraid to point that out to any of the staff and the staff would remove them from the queue - make sure you tell the staff what clothes those people are wearing so that they can find the culprit quickly to restore order!All in all I would always recommend the ocean park for a great day out with family and friends.

If you like to see animals, then ocean park is for you!Being we were staying over in Kowloon we could have caught various buses etc but ended up taking a taxi straight there for ease and convenience. It only cost about $120-140 HKD each way which we were happy to pay. Only took about 25 minutes to get there.Once again, the earlier you get there, the better. We got there not long after opening and went straight for the aquarium where a line was already building up. It moved quickly so no real dramas there.The aquarium is actually quite large and had many great parts to it. The only problem we found was that despite the many, many signs asking not to use flash photography. Many tourists chose to ignore it and do it anyway. Which when trying to look at the fish who live in dark spaces. Made it really hard and just felt bad for the fish really.Being a hot day we didn't venture on the cable car to see the rides but chose to stay in the entrance side of the park and saw all the animals, such as pandas. Possibly everyone was over the other side on the rides but it was nice and quiet for us to stroll through and see all the animals.All in all, a good day out. Prices are about on par with most theme parks if not a bit cheaper."

            "review": "Super Duper for an entire day of fun!. A huge park that requires an entire day and a lot of walking. Ocean Park is a combination of an amusement park, animal exhibits and an aquarium. We planned Ocean Park on a weekday and reached before the opening time. The crowd was moderate but cannot say that it was less crowded. A great place for kids as well as adults to enjoy. Some details on how to plan the day at Ocean Park.1. Buying Tickets: Tickets for Ocean Park can be purchased from 7/11 stores, at the MTR station from where Bus 629 is available as well as from the airport. We purchased our tickets from the Airport from the CTS counter in the main arrival hall for a discounted rate of HKD 265 which is much less than the HKD 320 rate at the park. For 2 adults and 1 child, we directly saved around HKD 150 which was great.2. Travel: We were staying in Sheung Wan area and travelled to Ocean Park by Taxi. It cost us HKD 90 with travel time of 20 minutes only. Alternate way to travel would be by Bus 629 which takes a little bit more time. Reaching 30 mins before the opening hours helped us queue up early. On our way back around 8pm, we took a taxi back and they are available in abundance. 3. Planning your day in the park: Once you enter the park, use the Ocean Express train and directly go to The Summit. There is not more than 5 mins waiting in the morning as compared to the Cable Car which is more crowded. Spend half the day and around 3pm take the cable car back down to The Waterfront area where you can spend the remaining 4 hours. This allows you to beat the rush for most of the attractions. We had only a 5 min queue in the afternoon from The Summit to The waterfront by Cable Car.4. The Summit: Here are the rides mainly for adults. So if you have kids, need to decide what you actually want to do. Since we had kids, we skipped a couple of rides at the Thrill Mountain and did everything else here. This is what all we did: Ocean Park Tower, The Abyss, The Dragon, Ferris Wheel, Eagle, Sea Jelly Spectacular, Shark Mystique, North Pole Encounter, South Pole Encounter and the 2.30pm Dolphin Show at the Ocean Theatre. We managed all this without any rush or queue in 4 hours. You can follow this if your priority is kids. For Adults, Hair Raiser, The Flash and Arctic Blast are must do rides at Thrill Mountain5. The Waterfront: Once you take the Cable Car from The Summit, pass through Old Hong Kong, do Sea Carousel and move to the Giant Panda Enclosure and Goldfish Treasures. Whiskers Harbour zone has a special Doraemon theme so our kids had a blast enjoying the rides and games. They had a ball. Follow that by the bird show at Amazing Bird Theatre (but the show was in Chinese, and we were disappointed with that). Move to the Grand Aquarium at the end of everything. at 7:00 we saw the show \"The Symbio\" with is an amazing water pyrotechniques show with laser lights, fire and fireworks. 6. Food: They check bags for outside food since it is not allowed. But food for kids is allowed if requested. Else there is a Pizza Place, McDonalds and a sandwitch place at the Summit. At The Waterfront, there are local food joints in Old Hong Kong zone. Plenty of places selling ice creams, fries, water, popcorn, etc.7. Water: Water is expensive. You can take a bottle with you and keep refilling it at water stations in the park itself. Saved a lot of $$$8. Kids can collect a lot of stickers from the cast members who distribute them for free. Various places where characters are there to take photos with. too good for kids. 9. Stroller is a must if you have kids. You can carry your own else rent it there for HKD 200 for the day10. For Shopping, plenty of shops for Souvenirs and Gifts and soft toys. But expensive. A summary of Must Dos:For Adults Only: The Abyss, Hell Raiser, The Dragon, FlashFor All: Ocean Park Tower, Ferris Wheel, Sea Jelly, Shark Mystique, Dolphin Show, Giant Panda, Grand Aquarium, The Symbio, South Pole Encounter.With the above schedule and details, we covered 90% of the park with ease and minimal wait time. Hope above details help you in planning your trip."

There was something a bit 'Wally World' (Clark Grizwold/ National Lampoons/ Chevy Chase reference) about this place but that's pretty typical of 1980's theme parks. Gotta know to expect that with the colours, the mascots, the music etc. but still easy to have a fun time. My wife and I spent a day here and enjoyed the short queues for rides/ attractions. We had heard that avoiding weekends was important and our Monday visit was good. Few things under repair/ renovation so not available, but that's understandable. Would I go again? Yes. And would I take kids? Absolutely, as that's clearly the target market. "

The Panda and penguins were enjoyed by my daughter, so were some rides.If planned well, it could be finished in the first half( for those with kids >6 years of age), else loads of time is wasted exploring which rides you could tk.!!!!The Grand Aquarium is just OK."

Great facilities, lots of places to eat althought its mainly fast food kiosks at the amusement park side and theres even a McDonalds would you believe!! We visited in October when the weather and humidity are more tolerable and also the park was fairly quiet at this time meaning queue times were short or not at all.

Absolutely cannot recommend this place whatsoever.When I went, the food was overpriced and you hardly got anything for the extortionate price. Furthermore, a lot of the rides were broken but they were still charging full price, and had to wait absolutely ages to get to the top of the hill, due to inefficient queue management and people pushing in front of you, and even worse, being encouraged to push by the staff. Even worse, the queues could quite easily have been mitigated for the river rapids, and for the tram to get up to the top of the hill and down (where most of the attractions were, at the top of the hill), but the staff had the brilliant idea to send the 4 capacity raft for river rapids, and the 6-8 capacity cable car, out with just one person in each. Absolutely horrific queue management right there.Indeed, the experience was so bad, we looked online on a smartphone and found that according to the Hong Kong Consumer Law, we were entitled to a refund. So we went to get one from Guest Services \"Sorry, it's not our policy to give refunds, even though the law says we should\" was the gist of what happened. Sure, they compensated by giving us a free meal in their most expensive restauraunt, but their flagrant ignoring of the law was just completely shocking. They even told us to recommend it to our friends and family, and even suggested giving us free tickets for them but it would be in bad faith for me to tell anyone to go here. Avoid it like the bubonic plague."

I was able to visit Ocean Park during the Halloween season, and the Park had done the place up nicely according to the season - from the little trinketed details, to the bigger massive structures & mascots. I must imagine Christmas/ New Year/ (any other seasons) must be equally lovely. Highly recommend this attraction a must visit, not as touristy as I'd think - locals love it there, too :)"

If you have been to Manila Ocean Park and Ocean Adventure, this is a combination of both."

After seeing so many excellent reviews for this park I had high hopes.Unfortunately, having visited Disneyland Hong Kong a few days prior, the whole park was really underwhelming in comparison. The staff were rude and uninterested in their jobs. The crowds were rude, pushy and oblivious to their surroundings and fellow attendees. The park was so full of large tourist groups which made manoeuvring around the park difficult as it was so busy. The decor was dated and could have used a lick of paint.On the day of visit nearly all rides were down for maintenance as well as the North Pole section of the park. No prior warning was mentioned when booking tickets that these rides and areas would be closed. Very disappointing as the majority of animals we wanted to see where in the North Pole area.The Giant Pandas were the highlight of the park. Although the enclosures seemed a little small for all of the animals at the park. Especially the seals and sea lions. I would recommend getting to the park, seeing the animals you wish (as they do have some fantastic animals) then leaving immediately. Disneyland was a much better experience that Ocean Park although you could not fault the animals. A shame that this park was not at all as I had hoped."

He did some google searches on the different to visit and see. Ocean park was his no 1 choice. Ocean park is very well done - it caters for old and young and most certainly outdoes Disney Land. The cables cars to the entertainment part of the park are great with amazing views. He was enchanted the entire day. The dolphin and seal shows great. The breeding area brilliant. The lack a little in the oceanarium however the panda's and amazing goldfish made up for areas that lacked. Certainly worth the money spent but you need a whole day from early morning till late and make sure you don't do on public holiday or weekend"

Make your plan a day in advance on the sequence of shows as there timings are pre decided and available on their website. Food is a big issue there, as the restaurants are mostly crowded with long waiting. We went on a weekday and still had to do with Watermelons and some fries initially. Carry some snacks incase going with kids.Tip: While there are big lines in the day, by 6pm the park tends to get more empty, you will be able to cover a lot many rides between 6 and 7:30 pm, with hardly any rush then.

Now it has been revamped, rethemed and I barely recognised it. For me, the main attraction is the pandas and my advice is to keep checking them if they are asleep - we popped into the panda house twice and then on the third time were rewarded with both pandas being active. The queue for the cable car from old hong kong was huge so we went up on the train, and then rode down on the cable car - no queue! There is little shade on a hot day in OP so be prepared, and it's worth noting that whilst the protest is still on, the 629 bus to the park goes from Tin Hau MTR."

There are rides at the various theme lands at the summit but they are very far apart and requires lots of walking, personally I feel it's kills half the joy. The sharp mystique (summit), aqua aquarium, hair raiser, flash are some of the must-see in the park. A friend told me Arctic blast is a must but it was closed for maintenance that day. Be prepared to be shoved, pushed & queue cut by people who don't respect fellow beings. It was unfortunate that on the day we were there, most food kiosks were closed & we had to walk a lot to the same venue to find food."

But currently due to political disturbances in the city, this bus is leaving from Tin Hau MTR station. This bus leaves you at Ocean Park Main Entrance and is thus the most convenient way to go back and forth to Ocean Park.*) Fully air-conditioned double deckers for a comfortable bus ride with lots of seats and frequent intervals.*) Can pay for the bus by Octopus Card*) We bought our tickets for Ocean Park from the China Travel Service Hong Kong Ltd (CTS) at Hong Kong International Airport which offers deep discounts. Ocean Park Hong Kong - Ocean Park Ticket - 265 HKD per head. Another advantage of getting your tickets in advance is that you avoid the lines at the ticket counters at the entrance (they have barcodes so you can head straight for the turnstiles). Ticket was valid for around 6 months and you do not need to freeze on the exact date of your visit.*) Park Opening: 10:30 AM to 11:00 PM*) Pick up a copy of the Park Map and Show Time cards at the entrance.*) The Bayview Restaurant has a Set Meal of Indian Vegetarian food priced at 178 HKD, comprising of one roti, a bowl of rice, veg curry and a tiny cup of H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice-cream.*) Involves a hell lot of walking. Ocean park is a lot bigger than Disneyland HK. Start early to cover all the park in a day.*) We took the cable car from the Old Hong Kong side to Marine World. Completed Marine World, Adventure Land, Rainforest, Polar Adventure and Thrill Mountain and then took the Ocean Express from Summit Station to WaterFront Station to complete Whiskers Harbour, Amazing Asian Animals display, Grand Aquarium and then finally end the day with the Symbio show. Loved the cable car ride, a must-do with amazing views, but the train ride was dumb, you do not get to see anything from the train. *) Get there early and avoid the lines.*) It's a combined zoo / aquarium / theme park.*) Pandas are the main attraction, Sea Jelly Spectacular was excellent. Grand Aquarium is a must-do.*) Upper mountain by cable car is a must where you find all the thrill rides to amuse yourself. Lower mountain level to relax and visit the pandas and view the tropical fish aquarium.*) Emperors of the Sky, the bird-of-the-prey show, was rather lame. Ocean wonders, the Dolphin Show, was nice. And, Symbio at 7:30 PM was the best. Narration for the animal shows was in the local language and not in English, which was another dampner.*) Make sure to stay for the night time Symbio show, featuring fire, water, pyrotechniques, music and animation at the Aqua City Lagoon at 7:30 PM. *) Toilets and Drinking Water fountains are available, but do carry a water bottle for refill.*) After watching Symbio at 7:30 PM, while returning back take the Citybus' Ocean Park Express (Route 629) from Ocean Park (Main Entrance) and get down at Tin Hau (at Central (Exchange Square) under normal cicumstances). Take the MRT back to wherever you want to go.For a detailed trip list feel free to visit http://hongkongandmacauitinerary.blogspot.in/2014/10/hong-kong-macau-itinerary.html"

The fact that my mom used o go this park back in 1993 and after 2 decades I come and visit it myself and still enjoy this park, is a true testament to the magnificently designed park. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 star rating is bec some areas are in need of a facelift and it could get super crowded on the weekends you can barel ride anything. If Disney wasn't Disney, then this beats the crap out of Disney Hong Kong. Disney has a brand altogether but in Hong Kong that's it, just being honest. Ocean Park is definitely the best bang for your buck. They have crazy cable cars that almost made me pee my pants bec it's hanging on a cliff. There's lots of rides for the kids to enjoy and have a nice relaxing moment that has full view of the surrounding area at the far nothr end of the park. Really, enjoyed our stay here at this park and it's like you're not in Hong Kong, wait there's a lot of Chinese people so I guess I am in Hong Kong.

Havent ventured to disney world so cant compare that but atleast here you have marine shows/ theme rides and animals to see. Theme park prices so not for your budget traveller so may need to take your own food/drink."

The park is huge and thankfully we went on a weekday, and after Golden Week so the crowds were too bad at all. We headed straight to the top/back area called the Summit and made our way to the rides as soon as we arrived (at park opening time). The cable car ride up to the Summit was spectacular and an experience in itself. Once we were there we had little to no wait to get on the rides and boy .....were the Roller Coasters were fun!!!! They also had an Arctic Area with Penguins and Snow Wolves and a Jelly-Fish aquarium, a Reptile House (with the biggest grossest spider I have ever seen) - so much more than just rides up there.We then made our way back to the front of the park and had planned on having a late lunch at Neptune's (that was until we saw the prices and then decided on a Plan B). There was so much to do at Ocean Park and we easily filled up a day with lots of fun things to do. I will say though - be prepared to walk up and down hills at the Summit. Most of the walkways are shaded, but for the ones that aren't - I can be a hot and heavy walk when it is up hill."

It's probably been a good 6+ years since I have been and boy, has it changed!! For the better, I'd say. We came mainly for the sights and the cable car across the mountains.We REALLY enjoyed the seeing the red pandas, the pandas, the monkies, the penguins, sturgeons, etc... there's so much to see!! There are many different aquariums featuring different species spread out in different buildings. Then suddenly there will be rides, games, and other attractions. They have a new 'old school hong kong' area, and being an ex-resident that was good to see. I would suggest going to the back of the park first, then coming back out as the strategy if you want to beat the crowds. However, to beat the heat you might want to do the front of the park first, then the back since most the aquariums and arctic area is in the back (I.e. air conditioned), and you can take the underground express train back to the front of the park to leave. So I guess you should plan your strategy depending on the time of year, and how well you can handle crowds or heat. There will be tons of walking, so wear good walking shoes (though you will see plenty of mainland Chinese tourists in heels or something outrageous). You probably would need more time if you wanted to do the rides, but we did great sightseeing within 5 hours.All in all, great improvements; be prepared for crazy crowds, but it's worth it and just be aggressive :)"

The queue can be very disturbing, with the express it can save you much time.

The huge mainland tour groups will come later in the afternoon about 2-3pm. Not all shows are nice, not all rides are fun, not all areas are opened.

There are so many animal exhibits now including 4 giant pandas, 2 red pandas, a golden monkey, several bird species, alligators, penguins, a giant aquarium and a separate shark aquarium. The rides are also great - the cable car offers great views across deep water and repulse bay and there are several thrill rides to keep the adrenaline rushing including 3 roller coasters. My criticisms are the abundance of souvenir shops which you are forced to walk through after every exhibit, the insistence on photo taken before every ride (seriously - i've just seen a goldfish so why would i want my photo taken for that?), and finally the new train to the summit is a missed opportunity for an exhibit (its called a space train yet there are no stars, planets or anything space related at all about the journey)."

Just a shortish ride from the centre of Hong Kong island you will find Ocean Park a supposed theme park and zoo for a \"fun\" day out with the family. You pay your 320hk dollars per person to gain entry about \u00a328 or $40. Once in you find a tacky theme park pushing expensive, stomach churning food at every point and shops selling \"cheap\" Chinese toys, tee shirts and mementos.All the decor looks tacky and the employees are dressed in costumes they might have hired at the local party shop. It was near Halloween and when we went to go into the Halloween experience, we were told that we couldn't as it had been hired by a multi national accountancy firm and was by invitation only. None of that was made clear when I paid my entry ticket. I was extremely unhappy about this and spoke to the senior guest relations officer Lyn Li, or at least I tried to speak to her but found her English poor and difficult to understand. She tried to pacify us by offering my 1 year old granddaughter a cheap pink Chinese toy. Needless to say I refused this offer and handed her the toy back.Sure the Pandas are a draw, but the other exhibits are small and there are relatively few rides. A 45 minute wait to get on the cable car did not help the matter.This place is for the Chinese population who have not seen slick theme parks available in other countries. Don't waste your time and money and head for Disneyland instead. Ocean Park could do well to take a few lessons from them.I will never come back here and would advise anyone to stay away."

The way the park is split in 2 parts (Disney would have made that 2 parks and charge for each) is great. The rides come with the most amazing views I have ever witnessed on a roller coaster. There is so much to explore! After some rides, my 10 year old was way more interested in visiting the jelly fish special, the 3 lever shark aquarium, the pools where the vets keep the dolphins. We were surprised that there are actually TWO enclosures for pandas and we got lucky to arrive at one of the at feeding time. Even a short (15 min) sea lion show was fun, educational and kiddo still talks about it.To get there we used Citybus 629, which was difficult to find as the protests are still ongoing and we tried 3 different locations (Star Ferry Central, Central Exchange, Admirality) before we finally found it at Tin Hau! Nice was that they sold tickets for the park right there, so no further lining up at the park entrance. A bit of a bummer maybe was that around Halloween time several attractions are re-dressed for Halloween and only operate on certain weekend / holiday dates. But since we came on a weekday, the park was nicely empty."

            "review": "Plan the day well & itll be worth it. Covered 80% of the park with 3 small children. Read my review for tips :). We were a travelling party of 3 adults and 3 kids aged 8, 6 and 2.5. Ocean Park is massive but its possible to see almost everything. Here are the best tips I can give you for a visit to Ocean Park:1. Get there early, at least 45mins before opening time. If you can prepurchase your tickets, which we did, it helps waiting in the Ticket queue. 2. My absolutely first thing I'd recommend is the Cable Car ride OVER the mountain - its one of the most popular attractions there. You basically bypass everything and go straight there and wait in the queue. We did this and only waited about 10-15mins to board the cable car which takes you over the mountain to the other side of Ocean Park. There will be hoardes of people doing the same thing, so I honestly recommend you get this one out of the way. By noon, the waiting time is like 90mins plus!!3. After that, if you can, go straight for the Hairraiser rollercoaster - the waiting time for that because we went straight there was only 15mins. Its a seriously fun ride, try to sit at the front if you can! When we got out the wait time was over an hour!! The other rollercoaster we loved was the Western Train one, right at the back - ahhh cant remember the name. It looked like old western style mining cars :)4. By then, there will be lots of long waiting times per ride - so choose them carefully. We didn't go on all of the rides as many had height restrictions, but the water raft one was fun (about 30mins wait time). There are some toddler friendly rides, and they tend to be less busier than the bigger kid rides. Basically if you see a toddler/kiddy ride that doesn't have a long line, go ahead and go for it :)5. All the walk through attractions such as the Polar Animals and Panda exhibitions are nice :) Kids will like that, but mind you, it does get crowded so keep your kids close.6. They are VERY strict about queue jumping, so don't do it. You are not allowed to 'hold spots' in a queue if someone suddenly has to go to the toilet, so make sure everyone, especially the little kids, use the loo before you wait in a lone queue. We saw a guy and his gf cut the queue, and the staff member made them go all the way to the back again! No joke! 7. Wear comfortable shoes and hats. I don't know whyyyyyyyy but there were women there wearing chunky heels and the most RIDICULOUS outfits there, with faces full of makeup and everything! Its an amusement park not a nightclub! Dress sensibly, cooler for hot weathers and make sure you wear sunscreen and drink plenty of water. A SUPER handy tip is to make the kids wear BRIGHT colours that u can spot far away in case they got lost in a crowd. 8. The dolphin show is pretty cool - BUT they DOOOOO get Full House so get there early to get a seat, otherwise you aren't allowed in! Take note of the times and try to get there at least 30mins before to get a good seat :)9. The frozen ice pops are SOOO yummy. Highly recommend. In fact, we made a point of buying one each when we waited in long queues hehe10. Believe it or not, having a stroller WAS extremely handy. When it was time to take the Express Train back to the other side of the park, the line was horrendously crazy long. BUT they have a special line JUST FOR PARENTS WITH STROLLERS. Not for people with kids, only with strollers!!! So we bypassed the lone queue and got to go straiiiiggghhhhhhhtttttttttttttt to the front! Soooooooo awesome! We could see people looking enviously at us hehe :) So if you have a toddler and a stroller, its super handy :)11. Food there was a hit and miss :/ If you're Muslim like us, it was VERY hard to find something that didn't have pork in it. I think we settled for sushi at the end because it was only thing we could find that was decent. Even then, it wasn't so great, a bit dry. So if you can bring your own little sandwiches, apples etc - I'd recommend it. 12. We stayed there the WHOLE day, almost 10hrs. It was exhausting, but you plan it well and you can do heaps. We did the Childrens Park at the end of the day as it was something to motivate the kids throughout the day if we told them we were going to that later. We saw a few Live shows and it was very entertaining. Overall - its a great park and I'd actually highly recommend it for a visit. I may not come back til much later on when the kids are taller to go on some of the other rides. Although we went on a weekday, it was the school holidays in China and it was still packed with tourists. So if you can avoid peak seasons, Id definitely say do that :))"

You can only get up to other areas of the park by cable car or by train. My son refused to go on the cable car so it made it quite difficult. Once up in the higher areas I found it very difficult to find my way back again. There was little signage or people to assist.The rides were either for extreme adrenalin junkies or mad adults, or one area for very small children around 2 years.There was little to do for our kids 8, 10, 12, except look at the penguins, panda, and go on the raft ride.I definitely wouldn't go back to this park, and would say that Disneyland is definitely a much, much better choice for people with kids around 6-13."

Ocean Park is a really great part divided into two sections down the bottom of the hill where there are all the animals and some shows and aquarium and then you take the cable car which was an amazing ride in itself the views were amazing. Once you get to the top you are surrounded with park rides, some of the rides were very extreme and others not so but it was a awesome day out despite the attitudes of some of the tourists and would recommend.Only thing I didn't like was they were setting up for Halloween and so they had operating all the rides and houses open but only to select people and would have loved to have been able to get my hands on tickets that would have allowed us access as well, as it looked pretty awesome and obviously we could not come back another day as heading back home. make sure to get to the Dolphin show early especially if its sunny as limited coverage and you will get all the tourists with their huge umbrellas sitting in front of you and becomes hard to see. All the animals looked happy and healthy and was really great to a=be able to see so many pandas and other animals."

The park was nicely decorated for Halloween (Much more than Disney) and the rides are a little rickety. The animal enclosures looked big enough for the animals and they seemed happy.

            "review": "One of the best days out in HK. So I think it's safe to say you can go to an aquarium/zoo/theme park in most places across the globe but Ocean Park is something special.Getting There--------------------You have a couple of ways of getting there. You can head to Admiralty Station (MTR) where there is a stand that sells a joint bus/park ticket. If you don't know your way around and don't want to use the usual buses then do it this way. Get there early!Taxi is another option and if there are more than 2 of you its a good way to go. If you happen to stay at the Cosmo (where I always stay, check out my review) there is a bus stop right outside for Ocean Park and then buy your park ticket when you get there. The Park--------------The Park is built on two cliffs basically - when I first started traveling to HK the only way between the two sections was by cable car or for those with fear of height by bus. Now they have a great train that will take you between the two sections however I suggest you take the cable car - much more fun and some great views over the water.There are plenty of escalators to get you around the hilly bits so walking is not to bad for most people - disabled facilities are getting better each time I go.Exhibits------------The star attraction, and main reason to go are the Pandas. When I went ten years ago they had two, they now have four! They also have red pandas as well. The enclosures are very well designed and you get a lot closer than you would think.The aquarium section is amazing, jelly fish exhibit in particular is great.There is a massive focus on education at the park and great for teaching little ones and teenagers about the ocean. Talks are in several languages too.Rides---------Every few years they seem to add something new and its always great - something for all ages. The mine train is the oldest one there but worth it for the view as it is built right on the edge of the hillside - you do think you may fall off!.and finally..........The real star show since the renovations a few years ago is Symbio. This is a sound and light show at the newer end of the park. Without ruining it to much they project pictures onto water (think bellagio fountains, Las Vegas) to tell a story of two Dragons who learn to live in harmony. We actually went back for a second night, paid full admission just to see this part again!Overall this may be one of the best days out for both couples and families. Every time I go to HK I go here because there is always something new."

There are basically only infant type rides and big rides that the girls couldn't go on. Both they and we left the park feeling VERY disappointed. We would recommend the park if you have little ones, or older ones, but be very careful with the 6-7 year old age range where they fall between the 2 camps and have barely any options at all for them."

I have just been reading some of the terrible reviews left by travelers, but I have to say, I don't recall experiencing any people cutting in line, which seemed to be the biggest complaints on those reviews. This place can get crowded and a lot of the mainland tourists will block up walkways and stand in the middle of a path to take a selfie every 5 steps. But if you don't like crowds, don't go to Hong Kong to start with.We got off the bus, went up the escalator and walked straight in. We followed the advise of others on Trip Advisor and got to the park early and headed straight to the top via the cable car. We had to wait about 20 minutes in the line and there was no-one cutting in. When at the top of the park, we didn't have to wait for rides, because most of the crowd was doing all the stuff at the bottom. When we finished at the top we noticed that it was becoming a lot more crowded as those that started at the bottom had made their way up. We took the train back down and again had no real issues with lines.There is a good selection of tame rides and ones for the more adventurous thrill seekers. The Panda enclosure was fantastic and is a great place to escape the heat. As is the North and South Pole exhibits. I'd have to say that I didn't find the Grand Aquarium to that \"Grand\". I think the Melbourne Aquarium is better. But it's a place to cool down and watch all those selfie photos being taken.The best advice is to buy your ticket before you go. We bought ours from China Travel Service at 1/F Alpha House, 27-33 Nathan Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon. You'll find the entrance to the stairs about 20 or 30 metres down Peking Road. They also have other locations, so check which one is close to you. Some hotels can probably help with tickets also.Over all, I didn't mind Ocean Park and I would go back."

Unfortunately on the day we went the cable car was not working so we had to take the train to go to the top of the hill. The train ride was also thrilling and the train in itself is beautiful.The aquarium in the park was very huge and I have not seen anything compared to it in my trips of dubai, singapore and thailand. Biggest aquarium ever seen.The rides in the park were hair raising. I took the Abys and enjoyed very much. There were many ascelators at the hill to take you around. It was fun travelling on these ascelators as they were the longest I had ever seen. The views from the hill were spectacular. Park is very beautifully maintained and it looks like a magical world.Food in the park was very good and not very expensive.In the end the show at the fountains was also superb.Enjoyed throughly. "

There is a bus that goes straight from outside of Admiral MTR to Ocean Park. I had already brought some food from the 7/11 before I arrived however, they will not let you bring the food in and will ask you to eat everything outside or throw it away. DO NOT BRING ANYFOOD OR DRINK!!! A group of us threw lots away AND ONLY WAS ABLE TO TAKE SOME WATER!Anyway, back to the park. It was amazing. Very big. I went because it was a Theme Park but only wet on a few rides as the aquarium and other animals were just amazing. I happily went from one animal area to another. They have the North and South Pole areas, The shark mystique, insect, spiders etc. It was lovely. The even have 4 Giant pandas there who look happy and healthy. Lots of food options, a bit expensive but thats the same as all tourist attractions. Used the cable car to get to the other areas . It was a great view. Recommended. We were a group of adults around 28 and we all loved it.Go if you have time, I would definately recommend it and would visit again if I was in Hong Kong. The other thing to note is, if you leave late at the end of closing the queue for the cable car is huge and they dont fill the cable cars to capacity so it will be only 2 people in a cable car and it holds 6. I found this annoying as you just want to get down to leave!"

They had arranged to take part in the dolphin experience which meant that they were given lots of interesting information about dolphins and then got to stand in the pool with the dolphins and the expert. They really enjoyed it and as an experience it was a good one, though much better suited to children around the 7-10 age group rather than for adults.We were then in the park early enough to mean that the rides had very few queues. However, the people manning the rides often made them wait for quite a while - goodness knows waiting for what! By 3ish the park was beginning to fill up with huge groups of people and as we left the coach park was heaving. Unfortunately the queue for the aquarium was far too long by the time we got there so didn't go in.Ocean park is very hilly and probably not suitable for those with mobility issues as there is a huge amount if walking between rides, though there are several escalators.There are many food outlets including a McDonald's but we took a picnic so can't comment on the quality of the food. ."

I was a bit disappointed during this visit.Frankly, it pales in comparison to HK Disneyland or Singapore's Universal Studios. It looks old, some of the rides need some touching up and upgrades. The saving grace would be the pandas and the penguins but the other attractions are a bit ordinary theme park things.Also, because of the mountainous terrain, it's difficult walking around the park (specially on the uphill parts). Food prices inside the park are really a rip-off (HK$170 for a spaghetti meal?).Getting there is also a bit of a hassle as the MTR station at Ocean Park is still being constructed. So if you are not going in a tour group, it's either by bus or taxi for now. When you go to Disneyland or Universal Studios, you will notice how immaculately clean their parks are - this is not the case here at Ocean Park.If you're in HK only for a few days, maybe you should not put Ocean Park as a top priority stop anymore. But if you really want to go, buy your tickets at the HK Tourist Services kiosk at the Admiralty MTR Station to get a nice discount."

Pros- Pandas- friendly staff- half decent rides- decent food Cons- line ups- safety- regulationsHonestly it is a decent amusement park in terms of staff friendliness and rides/attractions. The downside is a huge one and that is safety. First of all i feel everyone should be allowed to go to an amusement park and enjoy their day, but the type of people they get is ridiculous. People who do not follow rules at all, what is point of a line when no one stands to wait. People cut in front of lines, push and shove people out of way to get ahead and literally hit people to get to a spot in front. I would be 20 people behind lining up for a ride and have over 50 people cut in front of me to go on before i did. I respect this line as it is park rules and as a common courtesy but if people break these rules the staff should rectify this situation and move them out of the line and on top of that any violence act should be removed from the park entirely. WARNING!!! to everyone who is planning to with small children, if you plan to leave after 6 pm be prepared to fight for your life. We were at the tram to \"line up\" to go back up the mountain. Little did we know it was a deathtrap that we went into. we got stuck in the middle of the pack as it was slowly moving towards the tram. no one cared for the line and just cut in front as railings and ropes people just jumped over. Then on top of that people just literally pushed, shoved and punched their way through, If someone fell, well good luck your gonna get stepped on. I was with my 2 yr old nephew and i feared for his life, They did not care if you were newborn or 95 they pushed u and trampled on top of u just to get to the tram. there was only 2 staff to control over i say 300 people in line, i mean they did what they can but people are just ridiculous. They need to kick these people out of the park, violence should never be allowed. I was lucky to come out with a few bruises and cuts and managed to save my nephew from harm, but i saw a few kids hurt bleeding off to a side and older people falling to the ground. I am sorry but this is no way to run a business.honestly i would love to enjoy this amusement park and it has potential to be good, but this problem continues to occur i will never visit again. I will NEVER bring my nephew back here and will NEVER recommend anyone with little kids to go. I have been to many amusement parks with twice as many people and never feared for my life, this is the worse experience i ever had at anywhere."

Even though our youngest thrill seeker was 2cm under for the big rides he still had an awesome time. Yes there are queue's but as long as you go expecting this it doesn't really provide any challenges.The panda's were special as was the sealife and the daily show with the dolphin's and sealion's was worth a watch.Highlight for us was the gondola ride. incredible scenery / outlook and as long as you have no fear of heights (cause it is very very high!) you will love it.price wise once you are in all you pay for is food and drink but it's not expensive.Two big tips I would highly recommend - TAKE AN UMBRELLA - FOR THE SHADE OR RAIN.

A total opposite of Disneyland. A lot of walking is required since this is a very huge theme park. We as well enjoyed the dolphin show. It was awesome.

The funfair games where you win prizes are dotted in 2 or 3 areas and are also fun and pretty easy to win prizes to add to your day, however cost extra to play! Variety of food is excellent, in particular the area in the Old Hong Kong themed area has a lot of little kiosks to try, I had a pork steak burger with onions and it's definitely worth a try! This park makes Disney Hong Kong look small and a rip off. Definitely worth a visit but expect food and drinks to be around 3x inflated. For example a bottle of water from the local 711 will cost 8 HKD and in the park it will be 26 HKD. Still, as a major pull for tourists it's to be expected, have fun!"

Make sure to check the weather forecast before going because on rainy/windy days they usually stop the games but you can still walk around and have fun! you can never get bored. I loved the aquarium and the Asian animals, especially pandas and types of gold fish which were found only in China. Not to mention, the Cable Cars it is a MUST! you get to see the breathtaking scenery, it was my favorite part at the park. Plus, the gift shops had great souvenirs and at reasonable prices. Had a wonderful time with the family at one of the world-class theme parks."

Some rain in the afternoon was forecasted for that day; but we went there anyway.. Below is our horror history:1. Fist, there is no organization at the entry.. no queue for buying the ticket or getting access to the park.. total chaos.. 2. Few park staff at attractions entry.. 3. The food is so overpriced..!! and the restaurant staff is rude and unpolite.. 4. The staff is so limited on communications skills.. No just Chinese people visits the park.!!Besides that, the horror started about 5:30 pm when the rain showed up..The cable car was suspended, only the railcar was available for leaving the park.. well.. everybody was running to the terminal at the high station of the park.. no staff controlling the queue or orienting visitors about exits ,.. No lights.!! it was a total chaos in the darkness with people pushing each other... I have to take my kids and wife and kick a staff entry door to runaway from a human stempede.!! There was no security staff at all.. total chaos.. with hurt kids, people screaming and crying.. ! WWe found shelter in one of the maintenance areas .. all that chaos was only beacause a RAIN.??? that was unnaceptable.. That is an unsafe park..We went to disney HK two days after.. what a difference.. !!!"

There is also the Giant Panda exhibit, roller-coasters and other rides, the cable-car, shows and carnival games. It is a true theme park and provides something for everyone. Unlike Disneyland which is mainly for the kids.A real plus point is how they managed to provide as much shelter as possible for the queue lines.

There is many reason why you should come.----Animals!Panda is one of the must see when you are coming. Where else you can see one? ----Aquarium! One of the best aquarium in East Asia. When you come through the front gate. A giant blue egg structure stands in front of you. More than 4000 fish and 400 species are what you are going to see.Also there's a shark aquarium and a jelly fish one too if you prefer going.----Rides!Joyful family ride to extreme ones. Suitable for every family members of yours.----Events!One of the best event is the halloween event. It starts somewhere October. Trust me, when you leave. Tour face will be white all night.Also be ware this park have two areas. One is up top the hill and one is at sea level. Transport of choice is the cable car or the tram. I suggest going on the express tram(4 mins)when you are going up to save the queueing time(45-90 mins)and journey time(15 mins)for the cable car.Then when coming back down(supposing you spent the whole day up there and it is nearing close time), usually everyone prefers going on the tram or exit early. So the queue would be shorter for the cable car and you can enjoy the rare fresh air in Hong Kong city and view."

The park size overall is fairly big, with different zones such as an artic zone with walrus', penguins, etc, a set for panda bears, etc. you get the gist. The rides themselves were...fun? compared to Six Flags they seemed incredibly mediocre and not that exciting. The layout of the park also makes it incredibly inconvenient as certain attractions are literally on the other side of the park, in the corner, after climbing XXXXXX amounts of stairs (kill me...). Ocean Park is one of 2 (i believe) theme parks in Hong Kong, compared to Western countries which house hundreds of thousands, so maybe in that circumstance the standards are set differently, which is reasonable, but for me, it was a subpar experience. I guess i would recommend to families with children, but by no means college students visiting; just go drink or shop instead"

For the more daring ones, the roller coaster and free fall rides are available which we didn't get to try. It was pretty hot when we went there, so would definitely recommend carrying a hat/umbrella to stay cool.

The management does nothing to manage these unruly, rude people. They jump the queues, shove other customers and ruin the experience. We were there all day and still only managed to get on 3 rides, because the lines were long and being cut by others.At one point we complained to a ride operator about mainlanders cutting in line ahead of us, but they just shrugged it off.I understand that the management want the dollars spent by mainland tourists, but inviting so many means they need to manage the crowds and their behaviour. The washrooms were filthy. We have never found this before. Never.Unfortunately, we will not return ever. Horrible experience being shoved all day long."

The lines are long. My 6 year old son and I rode the whirly bird. We fell in line for an hour and the 1 minute ride was not worth it. Then we looked for a restaurant to eat but the two restaurants nearby are jam packed. The few places which can help us shield from the heat of the sun were likewise full. We decided to go back to the other side of the park to look for other restaurants. We used the cable car going back and it is the only ride we enjoyed. Good thing there are no lines as few people are going back. But it is the same predicament as the gruelling heat consumed our energy. Instead of eating, we decided to leave by taxi without objection from our son. He was also tired. I just hope that ocean park will put up some more air conditioned establishments where visitors can wait, eat, stand by or just relax. Our Disneyland experience on a sunny day was way better. Disney has several places with shades and several establishments with aircon. But to be fair, I am sure we could have enjoyed ocean park if not for the heat."

I took time to visited this mega theme park during my business trip in Hong Kong because I really wanted to see panda. But sadly, at that day all the pandas were having their long-nap so I can't have a chance to see the attractive panda. But overall, I really like this place so much. It's very fun to discover the whole place; full of joy and also a plenty attractive to see and try. This place is like a total combination of theme park, zoo and aquarium. I think, I almost explore the whole theme park except the cable car. One of the unique and my favourite spot in this theme park was the replica of a city street the old Hong Kong, which bringing back the culture of Hong Kong in mid 50's - 70's. I also loved the mega aquarium building, which present a huge tank full of fish. Very attractive and i suggest you to never missed this place with your kids during your visitation in Hong Kong!"

The weather started off promising but the monsoon rain soon appeared which we were totally unprepared for. Therefore, my advice would be to take either an umbrella or waterproof coat, unless you are happy to purchase these from Ocean Park. The cable car ride to the upper level where the rollacoaster and rides are located gives you a stunning view of the surroundings. We were disappointed to find all the rides were closed due to the bad weather, however, what we did find a little strange was that the cable car service was still in operation which took you up to these rides."

There is a public shuttle you can take for just a few Hong Kong dollars that you can board right from the exit of the MTR. Compared with theme parks in the US, this park is quite a bargain, however food is just as expensive. Must-do's: the Hair Raiser roller coaster, Summit cable cars, and the Giant Panda Adventure. These three attractions will give you the perfect spread of what ocean park has to offer: a unique thrill ride on the edge of a cliff, astounding views of Ocean, and up-close encounters with very special animals.Other than incredible attractions, Ocean park is spread over a small Mountain which gives you the opportunity to explore the giant park. Be prepared to walk a lot. Overall, this is 4.25 out of 5 stars."

I would say that this is a very nice and family friendly theme park, complete with all the rides, restaurants and bench to rest at. You can see all the views above and below captivating views while riding the cable car.What excites me most is our ride in the mine train. It seems that our heart pound so much and seems to stop beating for a while during this very long ride-that's maybe because of the very fast movement of the train. During the ride, you can see the beauty of the china sea.After the ride, we decided to explore the place.I should say that the park is very beautiful,clean and very well maintained not to mention their very accommodating staff. The food is good, you can choose for their wide selection of food. The games are not for the young ones only but also for the young at once.We went home with a staff toys we won from the games. The whole was a very tiring day but a very memorable one. I recommend this place to everybody.Given the chance to return to hong kong, i will re visit Ocean Park."

If it wasn't my sister that encouraged me to move on, I would have gone home by 3pm. I felt that there were too many rides in the park and not many animals to see. Fair enough, it wasn't a zoo, its the theme park. The facilities were really far apart from each other and thats why you have to do a lot of walking. The hills are not easy to walk because you are walking on slopes. It was really crowded. The only thing I am happy with is Neptune Restaurant (when you don't have to queue), the bus to reach there (they are fast and many. They don't make you stand throughout the ride. They ensure enough seats before they go), the animals we see and the cable car (don't go if you are scare of heights). Not only I wish it was less crowded. I wish there are more than one way to go back to the first part to the park so that you could go home (other than the cable car), and more shades, please."

We took MTR to Admiralty station and took bus 629. The queue was in orderly manner and almost everyone gets a seat as they have catering many buses to service the 629 route. No pushing and squeezing. When we have reached the park, from the entrance, I can see a big hill with a sea horse design on it and a big fountain. It looks like a theme park full of surprises. The ticketing booth is full of people and tour groups. As we have gotten the tickets from the Hong Kong airport, we went straight into the park to get our tickets scanned. There isn't any proper queuing system to get the tickets scan and ended up splitting up with my sister. Upon enter, we can see there are lots of small children and parents. Near the entrance, there are many souvenir shops. The souvenir shops have a wide range of souvenirs to choose from. There are different types key chains, bags, caps, hats, jewelries, magnets, soft toys, hoodies, T-shirts with conserve the environment messages, mugs, Hong Kong style ornaments, items related to there mascots, and even biscuits or cookies. I would suggest to buy these souvenirs when you are about to exit the park as you would want to keep holding onto the souvenirs when taking the different rides in the park. The park also requires you to have full energy as it is very big and full of slopes.There is a bakery shop at the left side near the entrance. The shop sells sandwiches, buns, desserts and cakes. There are turkey, beef, duck and salmon sandwiches, and there are peach, tiramisu, and almond chocolate Eclairs to choose from. Do try the duck sandwich and the peach Eclair. I bought back to my hotel after visit the park and it still taste delicious. Walking further down from the bakery, beside the Big Aquarium, take the escalator up to check out the famous Neptune's Restaurant. Over there, you can get 5-course lunch for around HK$258 per pax, which consist of a soup, salad, main dish, drink and a dessert. For the soup, you can top up additional dollar to upgrade from pumpkin soup to lobster soup. There is only salmon cheese salad and for the dessert is Haagen Dazs ice cream. Alternatively, you can also order another 4 course meal at HK$568 which everything (drink, roasted pork ribs) is up-sized with salad and dessert for 2. While lunching, you can see the aquatic animal in the aquarium and you can take pictures with them. Alternatively, you can walk further down where there are push carts selling drinks,cold and hot food, and even small watermelon which costed HK$40. Walking away from the Neptune's Restaurant, you will reach an area where to need to walk up to see monkeys (Le Le and Hu Hu) and pandas in a air con environment. The pandas are usually asleep. This is one of the place which to can see pandas and over there you can buy many panda related souvenirs. After visiting the panda, you may have to skip the Ocean Express Waterfront Station as this will bring you to another side of the park behind the hill. In front of the station, there is a tent showcasing different types of seahorses. Walk further down, located beside the \"seahorse\" tent, there is a place called old Hong Kong. The place showed the how Hong Kong looks like at the olden days. You may want to take many pictures here especially if you like things with nostalgic feel. There are also mini stalls selling Hong Kong style food, and game stalls where you can get to play fun fair style games. However, you need to play extra for the games. There is also a carousal where children likes to play. As for the adults is for the nostalgic feel when they were young.Walk away from the entrance of the Old Hong Kong and turn left 2 times, you will enter into a Panda Conservatory. You will be able to see Red Panda and the \"Normal\" panda. Again, the pandas are usually asleep. Walking out of the conservatory you will be able to see other animal such as terrapins, craps and goldfishes. Outside the conservatory, there are Panda theme restaurants and souvenir shops. Beside the Panda theme area, at the right side, there is a area where you can get to see different kinds of birds. However, is was enclosed and viewing the birds is difficult. If you are walking straight away from the Panda theme area, you will reach an area which is \"children's paradise\". All the items there are very fun fair style and you have to pay to access all the items.After touring the different area in front of the Ocean Express Waterfront Station, proceed to take a train to the other side of the park. The station and train are beautifully and detail designed. Do check out the amazing performance in the train which uses sounds, lighting and projections.At the other side of the hill beside the escalator up, you will be able to see the arctic animals and full of fun fair stuff. At the right side of the escalator you will be able to see parrots, , various birds, very small monkeys and other creatures that like to live in swampy and dark areas, like poisonous frogs, snakes, eels and cockroaches. Walking out of the area and turn to left to the other 3 areas of the park, there are seals, dolphins, and sharks. Other than that, the park is full of fun fair rides, snack bar and slopes. Towards the end of the park opening hours around 4 to 5 p.m., the park is jam-packed with tourists and the routes are jammed. Seeing this issue, we joined in the long queue to take faster way which is the cable car ride back nearer to the entrance where we can exit from the park. The cable car is very high up, small and provides a panoramic view of the nearby islands.Overall, though the park keep delivering the message to conserve the environment. However, it does not lived up to it as it has more fun fair stuff than animals. It is definitely a place to have fun, not a place to look at animal. As there are full of slopes and few shelter, it not suitable for old people or people with difficulty in walking. I hope they can make changes to the route and providing more services to this issue. The map is also not draw to scale, all written in Chinese and doesn't show what is in the attraction. I have many times enter a super long route and not know what is it at the other end, causing exhaustion from walking."

The zig-zag shaped enclosure ensures you can view the Pandas where ever they are in their well designed and maintained environment.Some of the areas very close to the bears has floor to ceiling glass. other areas further from where the bears flop around has half walls. Friendly staff mingle with the crowds maintaining low noise levels so as not to startle or upset the bears. It is very good.However, there is downside. And it is pretty big. The old Panda enclosure that I saw only 5 years ago and was then very impressed with, has deteriorated into a shocking level of squalor. The older bears are still kept there but now monkeys share the enclosure. The grass looked dead and the smell was atrocious. This is in marked contrast to how it was just a few years ago and was a bit upsetting to see.Beyond the Pandas, the next impressive feature is the aquarium. I am not usually interested in fish but I have to say this was very impressive. A wonderful structure that enables you to see the fish from above, the side and from below. The only thing I thought a little distasteful (or ironic perhaps) was the King Neptune fish restaurant next door."

It feels much bigger than Disneyland with animal attractions and rides put together. Queuing was definitely inevitable, even to enter some animal exhibits. Managed to sit on 2 rides (Flash and Hair Raiser) and that was all, the rest had an average waiting time of an hour which was a waste of time. My friend and I decided to watch a show mid day which turned out to be a tanning session as we were forced to sit outside the shaded area. Umbrellas were aplenty - thank goodness our view was not blocked, but can't say the same for others. The cable car was one of the best rides I sat, the view and thrill of climbing a steep mountain is pretty unparalleled."

The cable car is spectacular, and the transition from the upper to lower areas, I mean the view, is amazing.In all it is one of its kind, and both informative regarding sealife, animals and sustainability and fun. The one bad thing (and this is not the park's fault) is the fact that it has become TOO POPULAR with tour-groups in recent years, and sadly not everyone respects queuing, taking turns or even other people's privacy. I have seen tourists taking photos of people's children up close without asking (even taking photos of me, presumably because I am of other ethnic origin than them), push people out of queues, spit, smoke and break into restricted areas (yes, I have inside information on this!) making visiting the park rather stressful for those who do not appreciate this sort of behavior.

It will take less time using the railway but it may get crowded at times. The aquarium is located next to the main entrance. U may also see pandas, goldfish, birds, Asian animals and some other animals at the lowland (waterfront). There is also a kids playland called \"whiskers harbour\" for young children, where there a rides and a playground. Scheduled bird shows are available right before entering the kids' playland. U may also see how old HK is like at the old HK street. U will pass through it when u are heading towards the cable car station. There are food stalls, stall games & props in old HK style.Thrilling rides are at the headland (summit) where u can also see penguins, seals & sea lions.U need a cardigan to go visiting the penguins if u intend to stay there longer. There is a restaurant next to it. Try getting in at around the penguin feeding time, then u can watch those penguins cramming together for food while you are enjoying yours. The restaurant is not cheap, food portion small & quality so-so... Therefore a right timing makes the dining more value for money.U can also see rainforest animals in the expedition trail located next to \"the rapids\", a ride that may get U soaked.Scheduled dolphins & sea lions show are also available at the headland. Further down the theatre u may find Chinese sturgeons, sharks and some more rides. Headland is also a perfect spot for sunset watching. Don't forget about the jelly fish near the summit cable car station.Avoid school holidays as it may get real crowded. HK is also very hot, so better go there in autumn or winter.There is also a fountain & light show at the fountain next to the aquarium every night at park closing time.Don't expect to see all animals, watch all shows and get on all rides in a day. Plan your visit & book beforehand if u would like to do some animal encounters such as penguin feeding or touching the dolphins."

The two highlights of my day at Ocean Park have to be the dolphin show and the cable cars. I definitely would advise not to give these a miss. "

It is massive and the only way to connect the two sides is either by Cable Car or the Ocean Express. We took the ocean express as the queue was shorter. Lots of rides and roller coasters but if you want to do this sort of thing expect to wait on average for 60 minutes in a queue which then limits your time to see much else. If you want to see a show get in early or you will miss out. A massive park so expect lots of walking. I prefered Disneyland"

Unfortunately this would have to be my worst experience ever in a theme park and I have been to many around the world. No shade, crowd control poor and the pushing and shoving and the way many behave is disgusting. We were pushed and shoved and at times particularly at the train station at the end of the day it was dangerous. Do not go to this park, it's really not worth it if you want to have a relaxing and fun time in Hong Kong - it's unfortunate. Shame on the staff running ocean park they really need to review the number of people they let in and set up separate lines and employ more staff to better manage the crowds. My son is just saying now - the lines were long, no places to sit and eat and get out of the sun, minimum wait time for rides was 75 minutes, really busy. If you want to go don't go in summer and in the middle of holidays."

It was extremely crowded. The loud and sweaty crowds at the Ocean Express (you can guess which country they are from), pushed, shoved and cut Q, with no regard for young children or anyone. The situation is badly managed by Ocean Park. The theme park workers could only shout at them \"do not rush, do not push'. They just ended up getting shouted back at. It was stressful, chaotic, miserable (no shade, under the hot sun). I have never experienced such discomfort at a theme park. I am supposed to be on a holiday, and my kids are supposed to be having the time of their lives. But instead, they are experiencing this ugly side of humans. I am dismayed that this has been going on for a while, but Ocean Park is not doing anything about this. There must be a minimum number of persons allowed into the park. Where is the crowd control (especially for the group tours)? Hong Kong need to do something about this! I had very fond memories of this place, when we all came more than 10 years ago. The facilities have definitely improved, but the park need to improve in terms of crowd control. There should be separate Qs for family with young children, another Q for tour groups, and a general Q. The nasty crowd has made the place awful. It is almost impossible to get a cab home (after just three hours at the park, we just wanted to have a quick exit) but there were hardly any cab. So we still ended up getting the bus back. The bus shuttle is great though. Well organised, the buses are timely and clean."

We especially love the Shark Mistique place. We went on the Ferris Wheel and it was lovely to see the scenery of Hong Kong from way up high.Their park is stroller and wheel chair friendly, but those stroller paths are often longer than going up & down the stairs.

I had been to HK for about four times already and of course the happiest place on earth, Disney Land was never missed but it is the first time that I was able to take a tour of the Ocean Park.If you are looking for adventure, and real fun, this is the place to be, the trip to the Panda's sanctuary is very exciting, although they weren't that active when I visited their section, they were still a sight to behold. And then you would also find the penguins section up on top of the mountain wherein you may take the train or if you are up for more adventure, you must definitely line up and take the cable car and enjoy the majestic view up high.Aside from these lovely animals, you would also get to really enjoy the rides that they have to offer, imagine a roller coaster all the way on top of the mountain and your view on the loop would be a cliff, such an adrenaline rush indeed. And then there are also those interactive water boat rides wherein you can splash water on the riders as revenge to those who were able to shoot you and get you drenched. Not to mention those rides which will turn you 360degrees both horizontally and vertically at the same time. And these were just some of the things you may enjoy.Better make sure to be here early to be able to cover most of the places and check on the places you want to visit first and their closing times, there are attractions which closes earlier than others, better get your itinerary checked so as to not miss anything."

The pushing in the queues was also bad as was skipping the queue! Cable car ride not for those afraid of heights! It doesn't look too bad on the entrance side as it looks like it only goes to top of the hill you don't realize that's only the start of the adventure! Our car also stopped leaving us hanging for a few minutes wondering our fate! The queue for the train down took 45 mins and the kids said they felt like they were in the hunger games, with all the pushing and shouting it was a question of tactics to maneuver or jostle yourself into position to ensure you weren't skipped ahead of again! Seals,penguins,walrus and pandas all lovely to see and nice combination of rides, but aquarium nothing I haven't seen elsewhere and after the hour long queue in that heat fairly disappointed with it. The food is terrible so take your own if possible again pushing and skipping queues at restaurants. The worst part of our day was actually trying to get home. We left park at 6pm to wait for a taxi which took us 1.15hr to wait for. We tried to find out about public transport but no one could help us,it was chaos, people were queue jumping and the taxis only came every 10mins and with three queues to choose from they didn't always service our queue.

And the views are simply spectacular, particularly from the cable car. We went to Ocean Park in the morning after having bought our tickets in advance from the airport counter of China Travel Service. We paid 262 HKD/person instead of 320 HKD/person and, in addition to this, we skipped the lines at the Ocean Park entrance. You can easily spend an entire day here, but we chose to leave at around 2.30 p.m. because we had seen and experienced everything we had wanted.The highlights for us were as follows: the giant and red pandas (not to be missed!), Mine Train and Hair Raiser, the dolphin and seal show, the huge aquarium and the penguins. The only thing I deeply disliked was the lack of good food. They serve hot dogs without bread (?!?!?), for example. We finally decided to eat in the city.Tip: If you don't want to stand in line for the cable car, you can take the Ocean Express to the other side and return with the cable car.

What spoiled the aquarium was it was packed and loud with quite a few rude people who only cared about themselves. My 6 year old girl was rudely pushed by a middle ages lady who should have known better. Even so it is a great place to go and has more to offer then Hong Kong Disney.

The nice thing is it has some really great aquarium exhibits but it also has quite a number of rides, and there are rides for all ages. Highlights for me were the Grand Aquarium, the breeding centre and the new shark exhibit. In fact if you enjoy your day visit, on your way out you can just pay the difference to upgrade the ticket to an annual pass, which we did. They have a decent mix of food outlets, both Chinese and Western. The cable car that takes you from one side of the park to the other gives you some wonderful views and is really quite long. Definitely Ocean Park should be part of the itinerary for anyone visitng Hong Kong."

There aren't really any excellent rides, although plenty of them are good fun. Equally, the animals are all quite interesting to look at, but none of them are any more interesting than if you went to a dedicated zoo. The Giant Pandas are an obvious draw, but they were sleeping and away from public view.The behaviour of other guests was also a bit of a problem: following an argument, a man struck his wife in the face and caused her to bleed, which was obviously horrendous, but park security did arrive promptly and took it seriously. I suppose you get plain bad people anywhere, so it's difficult to blame the park for that. Less seriously, not everyone queued properly for attractions. A lot of bus tours from the mainland come here, and it seems there is a great pressure to visit all the rides before the bus leaves to return to Guangzhou. What tends to cause issues is when one or two family members join a queue, then the rest of the family hustle through those of us that have been waiting patiently in order to claim the space that was \"saved\" for them, which causes a lot of annoyance. One Hong Kong lady, turned and hissed at us \"these people are not from Hong Kong. They're Chinese!\". It was difficult to know precisely what to say. An \"ahh. I see\" did the trick, but to be fair, the queue-jumping was annoying for everyone.Overall, it's seriously not a bad place to go, but if you don't have much time in HK, it could probably be spent better elsewhere. in the absence of Giant Pandas, I should probably have gone to Disneyland."

If you enjoy queuing for a minimum of @ 45 mins in the sweltering heat for each ride ( which I would not be inclined to do in any temperature), you enjoy roller coasters and heights ( which my son & I are both terrified of), very loud and crowded places (say no more); then this would be your perfect excursion. We are not exposed to these kind of parks at home, (gladly:)) so it is hard to compare, but I would guess Ocean park is pretty good as far as parks go.Sadly we didn't get to see much, as most queues were over 45 mins long and the assistants advise you to come back, which meant we bounced between many seemingly endless lines. The aquarium being one of them. It was in excess of 37 degrees and the park is nicely spread out, so to do this in winter would be much more enjoyable but possibly more busy. Due to the heat and queues my 9 year old actually asked if we could just go home and swim in the hotel pool! We spent over 5 hours there and only managed one ride, the cable car and one show and of course the beautiful Pandas. The time was spent queuing and walking, we didn't stop for lunch or shopping. So a long hard day with few rewards. There was so much we would have loved to see but couldn't get into. Very disappointing .What we did see and enjoyed was the Pandas, unusual Asian fish, reptiles and animals. The cable car up to the summit was fantastic ( even for height phobics such as my self). The views over Repulse bay and the yacht club are spectacular, that made the whole trip worthwhile for me. We took the metro and had no queue purchasing tickets there but saw many queues. at bus line and park. The queue from the Metro by bus to the Park was nearly 800 meters long, right around the block and not moving fast. So we took a taxi HK$ 72 including toll. So worth it!If you are brave enough, I would suggest the following:- Take a taxi from your hotel; half the time, 10 x less effort and air-conditioned @ HK$60.- Get your map and find your bearings and plan it well before setting off, or u could walk in circles.- Organize around the shows you really want to see and are prepared to queue for.- Take sun block, comfy shoes, hat, fan, water, humour and plenty patience. - Definitely do the cable trip up, worth the queue. - Go as close to 10 am as possible (opening) as the bus loads come in from mid day through and it just gets fuller and fuller. Plan the whole day to be here and to do a lot of walking."

Be sure to check out the North Pole exhibit - it's newly opened and the seals are great! The shows are great for children, as they're interactive and performed in three languages (English, Cantonese and Mandarin). The zones system makes it quite easy to get around, but be sure to take a map with you - you'll be sure to get lost if you don't! The food & beverages inside the park didn't really suit my palette, but they're definitely reasonably priced.The ticket might seem expensive, but considering it covers everything, it's definitely worth the price."

There was insufficient shade; no drinking fountains that we could see (unforgiveable, as you could easily run out of money there, - the cost of food and drink was daylight robbery) and a confusing layout (we spent about 20 minutes trying to find the cable car entrance at the top, because we had been following the \u201cto cable car... with wheelchair access\u201d written after it). The frontage of the park is visually quite dated and in need of redecoration. Unfortunately for us, the three staff we asked directions of, could not converse in basic English either.The best bit for us, (or perhaps the worst if you are really scared of heights!) is the Cable Car. I am not so good with heights anymore, so I was quite stressed on the descent (the queue was an hour if you caught it to ascend). However, the views are truly spectacular \u2013 quite unbelievable. If we hadn't experienced that, the $320 HK dollars we paid to go in would have been rather wasted for us. However, we didn't go in with children and their part of the park, plus the animal areas may have been much more rewarding... There is a dedicated frequent bus service to take you there (629 from Admiralty Station). Journey was about 20 minutes, passing en route, through a tunnel of about 2 km in length."

If your children are little, you will want to research the rides ahead of time to save yourselves a lot of walking time. Generally speaking the rides and play areas for the little ones are mostly near the main entrance. Once you take the train or the gondolas you are looking at rides for bigger kids.The place will be packed but then again most fun places in Hong Kong are that way. If you are a group of 3 or more and are staying in Wan Chai, consider taking the cab rather than buses to the park as it might actually be cheaper and more convenient.The food in the park is great.

Before you get off at admity mtr, there will be a mtr shop next to exit B (underground), and they will offer ocean park tickets for HK$290 (around $41 aud, compare that to themes park in Australia, and that's a bargain) or you could pay HK$320 at the gate or whatever, and get a octopus card for the buses (long line tho). Its like a combination of sea world and dreamworld into one park. But food/random items however will end up the same as you would pay back in Australia, if not a bit more. But food there seem to be alright (much better than Australia theme parks) I went there mainly for the rides, but had a look at some animal places when the place gets busy. The maximum i waited was 15 minutes. But then again i went in the morning (ridden a few rides), then explore the animal joints when the place got busy, and when people starting to leave, go on more rides and double dip on rides in which i like. Rides are soo awesome (but if your going solo, don't bother using the single express line, because its still the same wait really). Toilets are alright enough (even though staff do clean them frequently, its still stinks anyways)Only bad thing, its a trek (even by express bus), but lucky an MTR station will be built there in the near future. And the park is a trek to walk around and when your against the hong kong summer, its not fun walking (but thankfully for air con animal en-closers and escalators)So i would be happy to return there in the near future. Or if i lived in hong kong, i would defiantly buy a yearly pass that they offer"

We wanted to see real pandas that's why we wanted to visit this park even if we were in Disneyland (HK) the day before. With my 5-year kid, hubby and I took our last attraction visit before our flight going home in the evening.I learned that the park was huge and would entail long walks. Since my kid is impatient and has a tendency to get tired easily from long walks, I needed to plan our trip carefully. I decided to focus on the animal parks and check the feeding schedule of animals on their web. I also learned that there are 2 sections of the park which are so distant from each other (waterfront & summit) - you need to ride a cable car or train. So be mindful in plotting which schedule or show you want to see. You may miss or get late to catch the show or feeding.We bought our tickets at the MTR Admiralty (Exit B) on the day itself. There's a long queue of buses going to the park. Since we have limited time to spend at the park, we thought of bringing our food inside. Wrong decision. They don't allow outside food to be brought in. Only bottled water or water jug is allowed. It was raining when we arrived at the park at around 10 am. That's probably the reason why even if it was Sunday, the visitors were not as great as anticipated. Umbrellas and transparent rain coats are available for purchase near the entrance. The rain stopped before lunch and the heat was unbearable while walking within the park. That's why the umbrella was a wiser choice.The park lacked the \"dreamland\" atmosphere of Disneyland but had its very own distinct character of being an animal or marine sanctuary. There were animal mascots that my kid loved.Since our objective is to see the Panda, so we visited the the Panda village first. My kid was so delighted to see the Panda. She wanted to cuddle or hug them had not been for the glass wall that separates the visitors and the animals. It was these Pandas that garnered the \"very good\" rating for this theme park. Otherwise, it would have been just the same other theme parks.After the Panda experience, we went to the Summit section via the Ocean express. My kid enjoyed the short show while inside the train. Most of the rides are located in the Summit section but these have height and age requirement so we didn't line for them thinking that my kid would not pass to any of them. We visited the North and South Pole encounters. My kid liked to watch the sea lion, walrus and penguins being fed. Being pressed for time we decided to leave the park after lunch, we walked a hilly long and tiring walk going to the cable car. Since it's early afternoon, there was no queue and we were able to ride immediately when we get there. We also didn't miss the grand aquarium.Overall, it was a good exercise because of the long walks, the food was good (more than acceptable) and we just loved the Pandas!"

Although Ocean Park has been around since 1977 (almost three decades older than Hong Kong Disneyland) nothing about Ocean Park feels tired, rundown or neglected. Of the two major amusement parks in Hong Kong, Ocean Park is hands down (or flippers down) the superior one.Ocean Park is half amusement park and half museum, making it a full day of fun and learning. The upper half of the park contains mostly rides while the lower half contains mostly exhibits and shows. The tram ride between the two halves is almost worth the price of admission.At Ocean Park, you don't feel barraged by commercialism like you would at Hong Kong Disneyland. Ocean Park is Hong Kong's homegrown institution, not a Western import. There's no Snow White or Mickey. Instead, it's Whiskers and James Fin walking around -- characters that you've never heard may grow to enjoy.There seems a genuine concern with conservation at Ocean Park, not just a shallow effort meant only to appease hipsters and environmentalist wanabes. In other words, Ocean Park's brand of conservation is the real deal.My only gripe is that, like most of Hong Kong's tourist attractions, the park will get overcrowded on weekends and holidays. It's best to go on a Tuesday, preferably on a cloudy day that looks like it might rain (but doesn't). The park is also very hilly, so people with less stamina may find it tiring to navigate the park.It's great to hear Ocean Park has planned aggressive expansion. They're building an onsite hotel and tons of new rides and exhibits. Ocean Park is one of five \"can't miss\" destinations in Hong Kong."

We were in the parking lot by 930am. then close to 10am(as we saw groups of people ascending the escalators) we went up to buy tickets. I waited in line since gate does not open till 1030am. It was sweltering by the time the gate was open. The Highs-We viewed the pandas first which was nice since it is air conditioned and no lines. The animals make it worth enduring. Panda was sitting close up and eating bamboo leaves- it was amazing to see this animal in action since they are rare to see in other parts of the world and if so seldom active. The animals are very active and the exhibits are amazing. I thought the shark and big aquarium viewing areas are better than Sea World Orlando. The food was surprisingly good for an amusement park-we thought even better than inside Disney/Florida. We ate in the restaurant with the penguins for lunch-no wait at top near polar exhibit. Penguins were so active-diving and jumping out of water. They come up close to glass and stare at you! We had dinner at the resturarnt with aquarium tank- no wait great service and very relaxing. The staff throughout the park is beyond helpful and very friendly. The Lows- the lines are long- but comparing to other parks that is what one typically endures unless timing/situation works out. Being that this park is on a mountain/island the pathways are quite hilly. Most people were considerate, but as others have posted there are those who visit that will push you to get ahead. They will push you in the bathrooms and rattle doors trying to get ahead of obvious lines. They will also line jump and think nothing of you telling them to get back in their spot. Some rides have staff that monitor the situation. The rides do not always follow height requirements- after waiting 45 mintues in a line for one ride we began to see children who obviously met the height being asked questions and then removed from the line. As we approached the staff said that there is also an age requirement! Even if your child passes the minimum height they had to be a certain age. This was disappointing as we made sure to check height and read the signs before even getting on line. We planned on leaving and not staying since the heat was unbearable even for a South Floridain and not many rides for young kids. However we did end up staying till park closed- finishing dinner at 830pm. Instead of comparing to other parks we just had to change our expectations of what this park offered. Animal exhibits great- ride selection/thrill not so great. The lights on the fountains were beautiful. We took train up to the top because the line was shorter(12:30) -got right on and then took cable car down(6:00) waitied an hour."

I was exhausted walking up the hill from the log ride and I don't fall into either of those categories.The day we visited was hot and busy which didn't help. Many of the staff either didn't understand English or didn't want to understand, very disappointed for a main tourist attraction.There was no real character or theme to the place.The queues were quite long, especially waiting in the heat. For example the cable car was a 75 minute wait. You need to take the cable car or train to get to the rest of the park.Also the toilets often only had 2-3 cubicles in the block so even that was a wait."

Although it lacks the dainty details I admire about Disneyland, it features a complete variety of attractions. There are enough roller coasters for thrill seekers and merry-go-rounds for youngsters. Moreover, it features attractions for people who can no longer enjoy the former, but are too old for the latter. Definitely a place all ages will find enjoyable! I hope they'd put up more food stalls with varying dishes/cuisines, though. As for cleanliness, it's a 3.5/5.Nevertheless, there are truly a lot of things to see, animals to watch and sights to marvel over (hence, a lot of walking). This is an adventure you shouldn't miss!"

My 13y.o son was done with temples, palaces and walls, so we decided to give him a day out at Ocean Park. He enjoyed the day thoroughly and fell fast asleep on our return to the hotel. Good decision & outcome.Ocean Park is huge. You will struggle to see every attraction and take every ride, even if you turn up at opening time and stay through until after dark. There s a great mix of sea-life and animal exhibits, rides for young & old and some old-fashioned side-show arcades where you can try various tests of skill to win a stuffed toy. The panda and penguin exhibits were high-lights. The roller-coaster style rides are all great because they offer fantastic views of Hong Kong harbour, in fact I cannot think of another amusement park that would offer such fabulous vistas. Ocean Park is a great day out.It can get crowded and in the tropical heat this can be a little overbearing. Get there early, take and umbrella & fan and drink lots of water. TIP: when you first arrive, travel to the rides you want to do most to minimise wait-time. Then I suggest you travel to the far end of the park near the Mine Train, or Space Wheel. There was no wait time for these rides when we arrived there mid afternoon - we figured because they were so far removed for the main attractions."

The scenery is beautiful with shady trees make this a very comfortable park. But the attraction is not very satisfactory performances. Panda venue, it turns panda was sleeping. Wishkers performances and animal show turned out in the local language, we can not understand. Which is far from expectation is performing dolphins and sea lions. Our expectations with a magnificent venue on the waterfront, featuring spectacular performances, but it just shows the dance and movements that are not special. Performing Dolphins and Sea Lions in my country feels far exceeds this performance. Other rides look very old and not too many takers. In short, this place is magnificent, but it is not supported by the readiness of interesting performances. Boring. Note also the vehicle home, if riding the bus, the vehicle is quite a long time coming. Better to take a taxi and get off at Central or Admiralty MTR station. Do not know if I want to return here again."

It is a little strange as perhaps 1/4 of the park is on the side where you enter while the other 3/4's is over the hill which you reach either by cable car or train. I only say this is that if you leave remotely near closing time the line for both is pretty huge with a corresponding waiting time.All-in-all though a great park with heaps of rides, shows, etc. to keep everyone entertained."

The collection of Asian flora and fauna endemic to the region is so fascinating. Everyone should see the Panda bear, the Red Panda, reptiles, all kinds of goldfishes, birds, salt water fishes, orchids, etc. The park rides are comparable, if not better than Disneyland HK. I specially enjoyed the cable ride. They are now connecting Ocean Park to HK's railway transport system for easier access. This place is so huge, that a one day stay is not enough."

Unfortunately there is not much to go on for those under 10 years. The worst nightmare is the entrance at 10am where some 5,000 try to get in and have to pass through a 3 to 4m wide path (due to park construction). a frightening experience if you have young children. The park covers an extensive area and in wet weather is not much fun. The park has become quite commercial in the last few years and this has spoils the enjoyment. The restaurants and food bars are crowded and none too clean and the food is poor, and the toilets whilst clean are quite difficult to find. If you have a stroller you will find difficulty in and around the park as access for strollers is very limited. This also applies to wheel chair access."

I go up using train and enjoy a lot of games without need to queue up long. After playing games and watch the marine show, I take the cable car down at around 1pm without queue. Just walk in and take the cable car leisurely. When I reached down there, the most amazing thing I've seen was people still in long queue to go up there while I have already enjoyed a lot of games and shows.MUST: watch the marine show (dolphin and other mammals) and you may eat at Tuxedo (watch the cute penguin while eating at the same time)"

We have been to Lunar park in Sydney-Australia. That too 2 years back!!! Many of the rides similar to these rides were allowed atleast with the supervision or accompanied by an adult!!! But was really dissappointed here!!! Dolphin show was just the usual dives and jumps-fun for kids( atleast spl for kids!!) The rapids was an excellent ride !!! Which we 4 enjoyed! A small kayaking type which looks like made out of wooden logs and takes in a small stream kind of thing and drops down splashing into water.Might get wet! The queueing up was just killing us, each rides took atleast arnd 30-45mnts! How much can you cover in a day!?!? There are many different food outlets,drinks,snacks etc arnd each activities area. We had Indian food at thriller mountain near the clown corner. Was very good, but had to wait atleast 30 mnts to get a table!!! be it inside the aircon hall or outside?!? They have trains to take you up the hill,cable cars, looooong escalators. Choose according to your activity! From MTR you have bus which takes us to ocean park- not free! 0cean park itself is situate in a hill!!!! So be prepared for all the steeeeeep ups and steeeeeep downs around the park!!!! Which totally worned us out and had to walk from one place to another and very time consuming!!!! The hot dog mine train was mind blowing!!! Excellent fun for thrill seekers!!! Its a roller coaster ride by the side of the mountain surrounded by sea!!! Ofcourse my little one wasnt allowed and it was a good thing! My elder one was allowed. The age isnt the matter in any rides but the height matters for every ride!!!  We couldnt cover many activities for the reasons1. Ups and downs in the roads, which was time consuming,which was also a reason for us to miss out the aquarium at the entrance and many such activities!!! 2. Queueing up!3.Height/age limit in many activities! The one and only place for kids at ocean park will be whiskers club!!! If your trip was only for kids make it your first choice, the rest is upto you! After our last ride at the rapids we took the steep escalator above...not just 1 but 2!!! Really steep and looong ones!!! Then to the cable car which ends up in whiskers club! Wheel chair/pram users have priority allowance(separate entrance) in the cable car ride. It was almost time up for the SYMBIA laser light in water show and also the closing for park time 8 pm! Not much exciting...but thats the end of the park time, so def you get to watch it :-) For all rides and activities try shortlisting the best and feasible by your group/family.

Group tours comes around 1pm....Tip: You can purchased your entrance tickets at the Tourism counter in the MTR (before you go up the stairs to the main road). It's much cheaper. "

Like at any amusement park, food and beverage are a bit overpriced, but the expansive wildlife exhibits and diverse assortment of rides make Ocean Park a must-see for Hong Kong visitors young and old."

Not only the exciting rides, the park actually divided into few areas and worth to visit each one, such as aqua city, asian animals (panda), marine world (dolphin show), many more..If you plan to visit each area and every show, I'm sure 1 day is not enough unless you walk super fast and not taking photos. For the rides, try to avoid weekend and holiday, otherwise you may need to Q for 20-45 mins for each ride. Once you bought the ticket and enter the park, get 1-2 maps from the booth on your right, suggest you start from aquarium, amazing asian, then back to old hong kong, after that take cable car to the summit, enjoy your rides and show at marine world > adventure land > rainforest > thrill mountain. After that back to whiskers harbour before leaving the park. This is to ensure you cover most important show/ride in your visit.Hope my info do help you plan your trip and please give me useful vote if it does, thanks."

Despite being one of the oldest theme parks in HK, it keeps reinventing itself. There are always new areas to explore and keeps you coming back. It caters to everyone in the family...not just the kids. The animals/aquariums kept the younger kid happy while the rides kept the older one (11yo) entertained. We particularly liked the new attraction that features animals from the Antarctic & Arctic. There are now alternatives to travel between the Summit area & the main entrance other than taking the cable car ( which always have a long queue!)..its called the Ocean Express and it feels like a theme-park ride. Can be quite fun for the kids to pretend that they are in a submarine.It was easy to get to, even if it was far from the city.If staying in Kowloon, I recommend taking the ferry to HK, and take the bus 629 from the bus stop just right next to the pier. If you are in HK, go to either Admiralty Bus Terminal ( next to Admiralty MTR) or Central Bus Terminal@ Exchange Sq. You can buy tickets to Ocean Park together with the bus ticket at the bus terminals. I had a Octupus card, so I just paid on board and bought my tickets at the main entrance. If you happen to have a HK Map, check to see if there is a discount voucher on it. The one I picked up from the airport had a voucher that gaive me 15% off on tickets when purchased at main entrance."

Time management is important as you need to discuss with friends/family which shows/games which they want the most (Kinda impossible to have all rides/enjoy all shows). I would highly recommend the ocean park shows with dolphins. For younger children and elderly, they can enjoy by visiting all the museums of panda/sea horses/penguins etc. Most of the rides are for children above certain height. it is better to check out before queuing as I witnessed how disappointed the kid was when she was refused for the ride. Most of the visitors go for fast food as they are relatively cheaper. A few of the roller coaster were under maintenance when I visited (little disappointment). Nevertheless, I had great fun there and would visit again if I visit Hong Kong again."

Simply speaking, there's a lot more to do at Ocean Park (and that even adults have fun). The panda enclosure, cable car, aquarium and dolphin performances are all must-do's.

There is one right at arrival lounge in Hong Kong Airport, as soon as you come out after custom's clearance.

Buying online or across the counter can never be cheaper than purchasing thru travel agents.Tips -Fantastic place and never plan Disney and Ocean park on consecutive days, as both places need a lot of walking and you will get tired. Thus, plan at least a day of gap between the visits to these two facilities.This is one place that offers all the various amusement options. right from train ride, cable car (pretty long ride covering over 2 mountains), river raft ride, aquarium, musical fountain, polar region animal life, dolphin and sealion spectacular show...............list goes on !!!Must experience :-Hair raiser (one of the most scenic and spectacular roller coaster rides (its on the top edge of the mountain, with sea front and has over 4 Kilometer ride).

Overall, we had a great time here, though I would prefer to visit a universal studio than this if given the chance to go again."

Awesome theme park, however would advise not to bring babies or kids under 5 as they wont be able to play any games and it has limited place to rest with airconds. For teens and adults awesome place if you dont mind to get sunburnt and waiting for queue. a walking distance from one place to another area. would advise to go up with the cable car in the morning because less people then go down using the express train as the express train is very fast prob 3min ride. They have very adorable pandas, the aquarium is huge and must see!"

My family and I decided to go here, as opposed to Disneyland, as we are all a little older and figured Ocean Park would allow for a more interesting experience, and we were right! the rides are all fun, and the beautiful marine animal displays are the best part. It's all very education, and I really didn't want to leave the park!!! The cable car over to the second part of the park was nerve racking as we were going through clouds/ fog, and it is only a cage - saying that, i felt safe in there. A great experience and will be back in a heart beat next time i visit Hong Kong!!!"

It's like another world in the park. I've also experienced here the highest escalator ride. I also love the dancing fountain and the lights during the night. I also love the Pandas.

Mainland Chinese hog the place and it's filled with them. They do not queue and will push their way in front of you, not hesitating to knock you bodily or with their umbrellas. Be careful if you have small children. The queuing areas are not covered or shaded so if the sun is out, prepare yourself for a nice sunburn. Once on top, the queues for the rides are so long that time is wasted just for a ride every hr or so. Signage is also poorly done so you'll get lost in that huge area many many times.

Ocean park is actually the first Aquarium that I have visited (when I was a kid) ever! At that time it was almost purely an Aquarium, meaning the attractions are the Marine life. Ocean park has changed since. The last time I visited (now with my kids), it already changed, with more rides and stuff and less marine themed attraction. Sure I might sound like I am complaining, but maybe it is also a good move by Ocean park.For instance, the Pandas are one of the favorites of my kids, for the second timers as well as the first timers amongst us. The Red Panda would make them squeal (though park employees are there to shush those who are too loud). The Artic and Antartic exhibits were also quite nice, though we were already quite cold from the rainshowers, we were freezing when we went in, nice to go in there during summer I imagine. The Penguins and the Seals were a treat for the kids. There is also a really big but interesting Walrus that surprised us by going near our group and \"eying\" us one at a time.I felt most of the shows were short, but what can we do? The Dolphin show is already dated in terms of tricks, compared to other shows. Bird show and Sealion show actually were more interesting for the children.The Main aquarium seemed to have become less interesting now, maybe because there are many other aquariums even in Asia. There are some exhibits that are not well maintained anymore, like there was a small display of amphibians, etc. and we actually couldn't find them in the display. The Jellyfish and the Seahorse exhibits however were quite nice and is what I would expect from Ocean Park. The Sturgeon fish exhibit was nice as well, but seems like it isn't as interesting for many people. The Goldfish pagoda is always a treat to visit, I have never missed visiting that exhibit whenever I go to the park. If you like Rides and attractions, then what Ocean park has moved towards is what you want. There are so many rides now that caters mostly for adults, though there are quite a few rides just for kids. So yes, if you like more thrilling rides than what you get from Disney, then go to Ocean park. The location of the big rides will give you extra thrills. I have a bit of a fear of heights (yeah I can take the cable car ride though) can't imagine riding the big roller coaster along the edge of the mountain in ocean park. There is no more entrance/exit at the other end of the park, so everyone arriving and leaving will have to go to the main entrance/exit. This means that if you took the cable car, you will need to either take it back or take the faster Ocean park Express (funicular). Those who can't take heights can take the Express both ways."

The lines for the tram going up are ridiculous.After you go down the tram, fried noodles are available for about $22, and you get to add your own sauce/sesame seeds.Get there as soon as it opens and ride the rides until about noon, or 1pm.

There are three attractions set a bit away from the rest of the park and accessed either by a series of escalators or, if you are in a wheelchair, a very long and pretty steep slope going down around the perimeter of the park. It is a long slog back up the hill, so be sure that you really want to join those rides (if you can) before heading to that corner. For long termers in HK, the annual pass is great value."

We then went to see the Monkeys who were vey cute and different to anything at Taronga Zoo and then caught the cable car across to the other side of the park where we had lunch in a restaurant with a glass wall to a penguin enclosure!

Glad we did, Took public bus out their,and arrived close on opening time. Tip. Do the big rides and your must sees first before the crowds arrive, More and more people arrive as the day goes on and by 4,00pm when we left it was pretty crowded, remembering it was wet. Didn't go on too many rides, but I'm sure will keep older kids, teens entertained"

            "review": "Best location for a theme park, despite some issues. First of all Ocean Park in general is a fantastic theme park in probably the best location in the world. The views of the sea and Aberdeen from the cable car and summit are amazing.The park has some great rides at the summit and the bottom part is entertaining as well with the Aquarium and Panda enclosure etc.Strange start to the day though, we arrived before 10 thinking it opened at 10. 10.30am was the opening time. No problem, we joined the queue which was growing by the minute.At 10.30am we were allowed in and people were hustling to get to the cable car to get to the summit first. But we were halted in our tracks by a second rope where we had to queue again. People were eyeing each other off and you could see this was going to be a free for all once that rope dropped. And so it was; people were virtually running the Olympic 100m sprint to get to the cable car first and who knows how many were knocked down in the process. Anyhow, we were in the top 10 and the cable car ride is amazing! Sea views out towards Repulse Bay were stunning.Once at the top we thought we rushed to the Dragon rollercoaster only to encounter...you guessed it, another rope!! The rides do not open till 1100....Arrgghhh...it is humid, we are sweating and now we are just standing here twiddling our thumbs...plus everyone else was now arriving. So, 1100 it was, then we took off to get in a few rides before the queues got too long. We did ok, few rollercoasters, the tower and a few others sufficed before the crowds really came.Then the rain came....we sought shelter in the Ocean Theatre and waited for the next show. Unfortunately it lasted 2 minutes as a thunderstorm lashed the park for an hour.We took in a few more rides afterwards and noticed the pushy mainlanders...they literally just walk past you in the queue and no-one says anything. We eyed these two off and said thou shall not pass!We took the train down and back up again, pretty cool but crowded again.At the bottom we enjoyed the panda enclosure plus the fish and had a browse in the souvenir stores.Another mark against OP is the distance between different \"worlds\". The log ride was miles away and sent you down into the depths of who knows where (no one else did either as there was only a handful of people down there) on the original slow escalators they had 20 years ago.Transport there is easy enough by bus or taxi, taxi is cheap, but beware of peak hours, the Aberdeen tunnel gets really congested so avoid 1600-1900. We wanted to go to Kowloon but he said wait in the harbour tunnel would be an hour! Screw that we said, we'll take the ferry.All in all a long, tiring day but we still tried to get the most enjoyment out of it. Perhaps we'll plan better next time. We had a better time at Disneyland as it was flat and well organised.Enjoy people!"

I recommend everyone to stay there for some longer time since some attractions (like shows) take up to 1 hour."

During the weekends it has lots of Chinese people, you have to wait in a line for every ride. I will never forget my space-wheel ride, I'd never experienced any of such rides before. The Ocean park has beautiful flamingos, birds, lots of sea animals, an extremely huge aquarium with sharks, rays, big fish... This aquarium is like 3 storeys high. We saw a diver feeding sea animals. I am still impressed by the huge aquarium. The Ocean park has many escalators. When you finally get to the top, you can see all the island and sea around. The scene is magnificent. There would be a skeleton of the yellow roller-coaster that far behind your back for a nice picture. There is a a show with dolphins. You can go there earlier to get better seats. After all our trip we took a cable car down to the entrance. I was scared as usual. The view was stunning. I think that most of the rides for the adults, though. If you have little kids and not much time of your stay in Hong kong, you'd better go to the Disneyland. Little kids will not remember the aquarium creatures, I guess, but they will certainly enjoy the cartoon heroes in the Disneyland."

            "review": "need 2 days. the park is beautiful place expanding on two levels connected via cable car and an ocean express train. If travelling with small kids, most of the rides can not be done. Most of them need a minimum height of 107cm. Also time wise for each ride there is an approximate waiting time of 20 min. The dolphin show is very good. A Mc donalds outlet is there on the 2nd level. It is a good idea to start early and reach at the opening time. Carry umbrellas or hats as it is too sunny during may and also humid. For vegetarians, please carry eatables along to avoid hunger.There is a huge queue for cable car while returning so going by train is a good idea. Also its a different experience. The ocean express takes around 8 min to come down as compared to 20 min for cable car. going with tours is avoidable as there is no special guidance by them inside the park and one feels completely lost. they only extend the pickup and drop facility and buy you tickets for the park.Mostly they ask you to return by 6.30pm which cuts down your timing of fun in the park. city bus-973 stops right in front of the park and drops till tsimshatsui area i am sure it being a very popular destination many other buses would also be there. overall to enjoy the park completely and to take all the rides, I felt that 2 days are needed."

            "review": "Fun Place!. Ocean Park is a great place with lots of things to do. The two main things are aquariums and theme park rides. The park is divided into 2 main sections, 1 at the foot of the mountain where it is mostly exhibits about marine life, and the other is at the summit where the thrill rides are. You can take a train or cable car up. The train is much faster, while the cable car comes with a fantastic view of the sea and mountains in the distance. For that, the queue was really long. I had to wait around 20 minutes to go up the summit and 30 minutes to go back down. The thrill rides at the summit are great, my favourite was the Hair Raiser, a coaster that climbs up the side of the mountain, and you get great views of the entire area around the park, beautiful! There are also tons of animal exhibits, from the polar animals to the rainforest animals. Some of the rides are scattered quite far apart though, so sometimes a longer walk is needed to reach places such as the Mine coaster. Overall, it's a fantastic place with tons to do and you can really spend the whole day there enjoying yourself."

We had been to other Asian theme parks and have been disappointed, but Ocean Park turned out to be a clean, well-run with a variety of options for a whole family. We took the MTR to Admiralty Station and hopped on the designated Ocean Park bus where you can also purchase entry tickets (plenty of big signs direct you to the bus). The bus took only 10mins. We did notice construction of a MTR station across the park entrance so maybe be running next year? The cable car is a must-do, there are big scary roller coasters for the brave, smaller ones for tweens, bumper cars and a small kid section as well. River rides and live animal displays ( penguins, pandas, bird etc). Plenty of places to eat including a licensed McDonalds if you don't want the fried squid snack! It was a slightly cool day which kept the numbers down so we didn't have to wait more than 10mins for rides. We were there for 6 hours and did not see everything ( we skipped the dolphin/seal/ birds of prey shows as had seen plenty of those back home). So, take the whole family, get there early at opening time ( bus tour groups seem to get there in the afternoon) and go on a weekday as the weekends draws more crowds."

Do not go to the Admiralty stop as some books might suggest. Facing city hall at the Central stop, you will see a huge bus depot to your left. It is open air, so walk thru until you find bus 629. It will be clearly marked. There are far fewer people waiting for the bus here. As you pass thru the Admiralty bus station you will see literally hundreds of people waiting for the bus, so to avoid this, go to Central instead. If time is limited, I would chose Disney over Ocean Park, but if you have time this is still a good day out. Once the bus leaves you off, go up the escalator and get in line to go thru security. Once thru, you can buy a ticket, 320 HK$ for a basic adult ticket. Once in the park, check the electronic monitors to see what rides, restaurants, and shows are closed that day. Then follow the signs and walk to your left thru old town to the trams. They will bring you to the top of the mountain. Besides the fantastic views, you will arrive at many rides. From there you can map out the places you want to see. There is also a train that connects two parts of the park. Use it as walking is difficult with up this hill, down that hill, and then back up more hills again. This will save you some energy. There are many rides and there will be a sign out front to let you know the approximate wait time. As it was school vacation, the wait time was just too long and we could ride some. The park really lacks eating options. At Disney and other parks there are numerous restaurants, but here you will find mostly fast food stands, and then sit on a wall to eat. One of the drawbacks here. There is a North Pole live animal building, a South Pole building and of course a dolphin show in the aqua stadium. When leaving check the destination of the bus. Still bus 629. Most of the time they will go back to admiralty station, which is still an MTR stop, so easy then to hop on a train back to your destination."

If you enjoy walking this is for you the Park is set on a side of a mountain so it is very steeps and hilly. Lots of rides and attractions, tiger, panda and more. It will take you allay to get around so bring your walking shoes."

Views also good.Didn't like - the large tour groups and particularly their inability to adhere to the 'no flash and keep quiet' requirements so as not to disturb the animals. Didn't bother with - the rides.An enjoyable half day out - some fairly twee areas (and rides) but some educational and enjoyable areas as well for all ages. Easy to get to (and the bus trip shows you areas of HK you might not otherwise see if you stick to the MTR) and lots to see and do. Don't expect to find postcards on sale (no idea why they don't stock them there!)"

The attention to detail is sloppy- wooden dividers with poorly painted designs lends this place an air of parsimony during its phases of development. The escalator is rubbish and many of the rides are old. On saying that, the cable car ride is stunning as is the aquarium. The dolphin show is a show- should it be? The food situation is abysmal, expensive badly cooked junk with nowhere to sit."

Avoid the park on the weekend its crowded, Monday to Friday very nice, at least all Themeparks are mostely busy. We stayed for one week in HK for holiday, 5 adults and 2 kids. We took a taxi to the park, it was very easy and not expensive. I organized the tickets via our concierge in the hotel, tickets are not cheap but honestly you don't get something for free. We don't had the feeling we were cheated for the price. The park itself is a mixture between zoo and fun park. The landscape is amazing, very very green. We took our own food with us and some drinks, nobody checked our bags. Near the entrance area you have a lake with loud pathetic music, its a bit surreal. At first we visit the Aquarium, its a middle size one with a lot of information about the ocean. Our kids liked it very much to touch a starfish. Afterwards we took a look to the Panda's. All buildings are in good condition, the whole park is very clean and well maintened. Service staff is very friendly and helpfull, especially if you have small kids and a push trolley. If you are finished with the first part of the park you can use the cable car (very nice view) or the train to the upper part with all fun attacktions like rollercoaster and more. The train is typical themepark kitsch but its what we expacted and well done. If you want to do the water rafting, be aware you will be completly wet in end. An umbrella will not help. We stayed 4 hours in the park till 3:30 pm and left then because many tour groups were arriving and it was very full. Back to the hotel we took again a taxi. Taxi queue direct at the main entrance. Take care about the information sign for the right taxi."

The cable car is a highlight, but the lines for the rides are terribly long, with some reaching 60 minutes of waiting. We left early to avoid the mad rush out of the Park, and the shortage of taxis when closing time comes."

There are many attractions and games inside the park. There are three large areas you'd need to visit. From the starting area, take the express train or cable car to come to the second one where games are located. Then come visit the third area for food if needed. From the second area you can see the Aberdeen bay where cruisers and ships are. A great combination of mountain and light-green will probably fall into your eyes. Tip: take bus 629 from Central Pier 7 or from MTR Admiralty Station, Exit B and alight at the park. Buy entrance ticket at the bus station to save time. Otherwise you would have to wait in a long line-up at the entrance gate of Ocean Park. Lots of people especially so many groups of adults come in."

Reach early, try and go on a weekday and complete everything by 2 ish. If you do finish early and have some time to spare then take a bus to Stanley. This way you save the trip to get here coz where Ocean Park and Stanley are located you need to take a pretty long bus ride or cab ride after the MTR. Basically steer clear of this if you don't like horrendous lines. Maybe if you do this before Disney you won't feel that cheated. The only worthwhile thing is the cable car ride."

There are some worthwhile rides in the park. The queue for the Gondola after lunch will be over an hour. The animal shows are poor, the panda bear and monkey exhibits are a yawn. The sea lion and dolphin show are pathetic to say the least, not even close to Sea world San Diego and Australia. The Aquarium is OK but not Great, The Arctic exhibit promises a lot but delivers little and smells bad. OK to pass the time.

Our education director, Vivian, and the Panda keepers made this behind the scenes a once-in-a-lifetime experience that was so worth the moderate expense! In addition to learning about giant pandas, we got to prepare the food for Lele, their younger male giant panda, FEED him the food we prepared, and then went into his exhibit area and laid out bails of fresh bamboo. Once out of his exhibit area, we went around to the front of the exhibit where regular Ocean Park patrons are, and got to watch Lele eat the bamboo we left for him. We also got to visit behind the scenes of the red panda named Chong Chong. Best experience ever!Since the panda experience is from 9am-11am, we were at Ocean Park early, and had heard about the long queues which happen typically in the AFTERNOON when all the Chinese tours show up. So, my tip: Go first thing in the morning and ride the popular rides then, because around 2pm, the park is full of people and the lines do get long. We had a less than 5 minute wait for the Hair Raiser roller coaster ride and 15 minute wait for the Whirly Bird. If you are like us and want to buy souvenirs, you might want to check with the main gift shop at the park entrance. They were offering 20% off your purchase, but only at that shop!"

We wanted to see the pandas and thought the kids (9&7) would enjoy the rides. We bought our tickets in advance from a 7/11 store which was good as there was a queue. We got a taxi from the Harbour Grand Kowloon and it wasn't that expensive and was quite quick. We got the bus back at the end of the day and there were huge queues but lots of buses so it was very easy. The park has so much to see and do for families with kids our age. We really had to move quickly to get enough done in a day. We loved seeing the pandas and saw 3 out of the 4 of them which was great. We loved the cable car ride up to the top section - great views. The kids loved the rides and the queues weren't too bad compared to Chessington in the UK!! The park is in such a beautiful setting and was definitely a great day out for our family, so glad we went. Do go early to fit it all in. There is a lot of walking and some rides are quite far from others and up and down steps / escalators. A few rides were closed but that didn't bother us. Looks like a poncho is a good idea for the water rides. It is busy but so are all theme parks. We will go back if in HK again."

The ride going there was very pleasant.At Ocean Park itself, there's a huge diversity on what you could do, from rides to different animals. I would recommend you go on the cable car first, which gives you such a great view of the entire place. It's a huge park, and it's a relaxing but very scenic ride. From the top, you could begin choosing which rides to go to. However, like I said in the title page, if you have smaller kids who aren't really into rides, then it would be much better to go to Disneyland instead. I think Ocean Park will be worth it only if you can go for both the rides and see all the animals. Since we had kids along (who didn't do the rides), our visit was more limited. The kids were still very pleased with the Ocean Theatre show, as well as the penguins, though.Still, what stays in my mind for Ocean Park is the long cable car, the classic rides, and the penguins and pandas. All in all, so much fun."

The buses leave every 10 minutes or so from the bus station just outside the MTR exit (bus fare not included in the price but you can use your Octopus card). Ocean Park is brilliant. Loads of animals: Pandas, otters, seals, dolphins, penguins and a massive aquarium to name but a few. Some of it has to be seen to be believed. Cable cars take you up the hill which is part of the experience. There are quite a few roller coasters and thrill rides but expect to queue for 45 minutes or so for some. Make sure you wait till the finale about 8pm near the entrance at the fountain for the light/fire/fireworks show."

There are some slightly less death-defying rides, however, such as the The Rapids, which are fun.The cable car ride and views are superb.The animals are also fantastic. The highlight, though, undoubtedly, is the pandas, which are beautifully and meticulously catered for. Other reviewers mention the mainlanders and their strange, pushy behaviour. It's all true. They seem to be in a hurry and like to push and shove. If this is the first time you have experienced this, it's worth recording it as a new cultural experience.

This is especially irritating when you were tired and you had to queue for an hour or so for your turn, and yet, there were some inconsiderate people who will cut the queue like nobody's business. When these people cut queue, the people queuing didn't even ask them to queue from the back, and they let them in (they do not know each other). My experience tells me that these people do not dare to cut in front of you if you actually voiced out sternly that everybody is queuing and they are supposed to queue too! I think we should voice out and stop letting these situations happened, so that these inconsiderate people will not keep on thinking that everyone will let them cut in anyways."

You don't have to make any online reservation, simply head to any 7-11 store and say \"hai yang gong yuan\" and number of tickets. Hassle-free purchase. Head over to Admiralty station and follow the signs leading you to bus 629. The last stop is Ocean Park and the ride takes approximately 15mins. Present the 7-11 ticket for entrance and the first attraction would be the Grand Aquarium. I was lucky enough to spot a unique fish at the Grand Aquarium. *refer to my photo* The body has a moon, it's even smiling! Overall, it was an average exhibition. However the gifts they have were magnificent! I got myself a really adorable penguin.We went for more exhibitions afterwards and skipped all except on thrill ride. My bad experience came during the queue for Ocean Park Tower. Mainlander aunties were discussing about how to cut the queue. It was really annoying because the queue was not even that long!When it was our turn to enter the deck, the staff sounded really pissed off at the mainlanders because they simply cannot follow simple instructions. I was quite sullen too because they were speaking at the top of their voice, reverberating throughout the entire viewing deck.By the way, you will often smell something really fragrant in the park. It is actually grilled squid from the stall. I strongly urge you to have at least one person to share the entire piece with,otherwise it gets kinda revolting.Before you leave,remember to go Old Hong Kong section of the park. Look for the ice cream stall which sells a coca-cola ice blended. It was awesome and quite a bargain! Go deeper into the area and you can take photos with an antique bus on display there. You can even enter the bus!Take bus 629 back to Admiralty station. Or you can opt to head to Aberdeen for Jumbo restaurant like me."

With a pat-on-the-back smile for having behaved that way.My family and I arrived on a weekday morning at 11am hoping to beat the heat and the queue. The crowd was still mangeable, with computerized signs at queues indicating expected waiting time, which is useful. We went to several shows and exhibits before lunch.The crowd increased significantly after lunch where hordes of tourists were flooding into the popular attractions. We were prepared to wait 30 mins to get into the Grand Aquarium. The snaking queue was orderly at first with a few trying their luck to nudge ahead of you while moving along. And the deafening noise from the chatter and shouting! Without warning, a few of them decided that it was fun/right to crawl under the flimsy barrier to cut lines of queue. They scoffed and laughed at the sign that read \"Please do not cut queue\". Once someone saw someone cut queue the floodgates opened. Groups of people followed suit and soon people around us were pushing and shouting. We were pushed from all directions and my elderly parents had to fend for themselves when we were separated. Having decided we could not take such an incredible, we crawled under barrier and exited the queue.There was absolutely no decency in the way a good portion of the tourist behaved and the best part of our visit was us leaving the place.

We visited with our 5-year old daughter and we all really enjoyed our time there! We saw one of the pandas, the red panda, an otter frolicking in the water, penguins and Arctic foxes. The Goldfish pavilion is simply beautiful. When asked, my daughter said she loved Ocean Park more than Disneyland.We will definitely go back on our next trip!"

I am not kidding, let's plan to celebrate your next birthday (with your friends and family) at Ocean Park, if you are the holder of the Hong Kong Identity Card ; as you would be enjoying free entry to this one of the best Theme Park and with Live animals in Asia and in the World on your Big day.Pandas, Penguins, Dolphins, Whales, Sharks, Jelly Fish, Seals, Sea Cucumbers, Sea Urchins, Sea Horses, Rare types of Fish...............you named it..............all are waiting for you to visit them, inhabited in the vividly designed water spots and environment.You may take a ride via the Ocean Express (train) or you can travel by the Cable Car to enjoy the spectacular views of the sea to the other side of the Island within Ocean Park. There, you can enjoy the ecstasy of riding on the roller coasters or other exciting games in the Amusement Park.I think the best way to describe Ocean Park is to keep yourself fully entertaining under a delightful, high tech & lively environment, with variety & with many lovely & friendly & amazing animals (both land and sea's) surrounding you ; it's really worthwhile to go there and enjoy such a unique & relaxing moment via your own personal experience.P.S. Do visit and have lunch at the restaurant within the Penguin House, it's really yummy, not expensive and you can watch the feeding of the penguins on live, at some specific time slots.At least once in your life time, to visit Ocean Park of Hong Kong, come come come !!!!!!!!!"

The Park is a combination of a theme park with rides, a mini-zoo with selected birds and wild life and a museum showcasing Hong Kong in the early days through some old shop facades on old Hong Kong Street. Have a meal at the Terrace Cafe and take in the beautiful view of the ocean, with the string of cable cars fighting for attention. End the day by taking the iconic cable car down from the restaurant.

Lots of zoos around the world could leatn a thing or two from ocean park, in terms of how their animals should be housed and looked after.Visiting midweek, queues were minimal for everything we went on, with the longest being about 15 minutes for one of the roller coasters.Dining options were a bit limited, but then again, we weren't there for the food, so that didn't detract from the experience at all.We even adopted a couple of plush penguins from the gift shop, really soft and adorable; my wife claimed they kept begging \"take me home, take me home\" every time we walked past ~~~"

There aren't a lot of high adrenaline rides (and while I was there one of them was under maintenance), but they're pretty spread out so you can explore the park at your leisure, while checking out the animals and shows.Seen some reviews that state the animals are being mistreated - got to say while I was there I didn't see anything of the sort. Frankly this was the best treatment of animals I'd seen while in China - decent sized enclosures, things for the animals to interact and exercise with, no over handling, more places in China should be treating their animals like this.My 2 biggest vices - the animal shows are very 'meh'. On the one hand, most of the animals aren't doing tricks, which I approve of, on the other, the shows aren't very engaging even for children. Secondly, the only way to get into the main area of the park is by ride. Either the cable car or the Ocean Express train. In the morning that's fine - by the evening? Be prepared to wait up to an hour just to get out of the park while everyone tries to get back to the front area for the nightly light show."

Some of the rides were good but nothing special or different to the rides at dreamworld in Australia. The dolphin show was terrible and we got up and left after 20 minutes. I think it was because they repeated everything in 2 languages. Nice to cater for us but it made it slow and boring to watch. Given the layout and all the walking there is to get to everything we wouldn't go again on our next visit to Hong Kong.

Although the aquariums are small compared to other oceanariums, other attractions will make up for it. you can choose the express train which has a cool underwater themed media or the exciting cable car for going to different sections of the park. Most of the rides have height restrictions. I think i saw a mtr station under construction which will bring you directly to the park. Highly recommended for first timers in Hongkong."

When you get to the park, start immediately from \"The Summit\" (the top part of the park where you reach with Cable Car or the Ocean Express train) as it closes first at 18:00 before \"The Waterfront\" which closes at 19:00. We reached at 11:30 (park opens at 10:30) and we could not visit all rides because we spend more time at the Waterfront, especially the Aquarium. Go through the Aquarium very fast, it wasn't that great as I expected. Lunch we had from Bayview restaurant, located at the summit stop of cable car. Food I'll rate from 4-4.5 and the place was not really clean, may be it was late in the afternoon, but the view outside was amazing. Try to sit at any of the corner where you will have view on both sides. The best ride for me was the \"Hair Raiser\" at the \"Thrill Mountain\". The location of the \"Adventure Land\" was a bit awkward, had to walk a lot. The park visit ended with the Symbio show at the Waterfront, its a must watch. Try not to stay close to the fountain as this show has some fireworks which might deafen you, if you are very near to the detonator, and the fire will make you feel like you are in a sauna. This is the only show we were able to see and also missed the rollercoaster ride \"The Dragon\". One day wasn't enough, so I suggest you to be there when the park opens itself at 10:30."

Plan areas you want to see, others are FAR hike from the other - as the park is separated and reachable by either Cable Car/Tram. Due to the large land area, most parts are not furbished. REMINDER: Be sure to print ticket barcode for those bought online. Neither Customer service accepted confirmation email. I was directed to go to a local library via taxi to print (took about 30mins). At the library, there were 3 other people printing the same thing. I think this is something basic they should have."

Some of them are thrilling and I don't even have the guts to ride them. But I don't fancy the aquarium. I think it's still too small and mediocre. I also saw the giant panda exhibition, and imagine how surprised I am to only see 3 pandas at the building. I can even see a lot more at the zoos in Indonesia. I'm impressed to know that the cable cars and express train are available inside the park, though. It is very helpful to prevent yourself from getting too tired because the park sure is big. The view from the cable car was also stunning! However, you have to be patient because I had to wait for 30 minutes to get into the cable car.. you will definitely wait longer during weekends. Ocean park was fun and enjoyable. Maybe I just had too many expectations and maybe I didn't get the chance to explore it more. If you want to get the whole \"tourist experience\", you better visit it. But if you don't really fancy amusement parks, I suggest to save your 380 HKD and spend it somewhere else. And for muslim visitors, there are 1 halal restaurant inside the park. I still suggest you to bring your own food and eat at the dining tables inside, since the halal restaurant is not so easy to find. There are praying rooms inside as well, you just have to contact the information centre to get more info about the location."

We ate at the Bayview Restaurant and the food there was good. We were there during the week and the day was cloudy so there were not that many people. I suppose the place is like hell on sunny weekends.A few tips: To get there with public transportation go to the Admirality MTR station. There are signs to the bus stop and the buses go non-stop. On the park we suggest to start on The Summit side. Most people go through The Waterfront side first and then The Summit so the crowds move at the same time. The Summit side attractions also close an hour earlier. The lines to the Cable Car were ridiculous on both sides even on a slow day so we used the Ocean Express."

As we had sampled two days at Disney, Ocean Park paled in significance. The kids really enjoyed, we adults did too, probably due to it not being as busy as Disneyland. Ocean Park has its own mascot/Characters, each one just as cute as Disney. the photos are on a par with Disney and it cost me another $700... all in all worth a visit, to be honest if you was to try one and not the other, then you would not be disappointed with Ocean Park..

The food choices were reasonable and not too expensive.To get there is very easy, we went via Admiralty MTR station, followed the signs and joined the ticket queue.The one disappointment were the pandas, both feamles were in their dens, both males were outside, one was asleep. The other paced his cage and it was distressing to see.The characters they had dotted around the park (Halloween) were great and we all enjoyed their antics and the interactions we had. They made a good day so MUCH better.If you have a day to spare then this is a good use of your time. If you want a contrast to the commercialism that is Disneyland, then this is also the place for you.Enjoy, we did"

But the crowning glory was the cable car ride! The shops also had an excellent selection of bags, trinkets, and other souvenirs. The food was ok. The views from the hilltop were breathtaking. Overall a must-see in Hong Kong!"

This was perfect as the weather was just perfect, not too warm, not too cold.We were looking forward to seeing the pandas, however were a little disappointed that they weren't out of their back room. I was later told that they do not come out as much, but you may get lucky to catch them. We did catch one who kept coming out and doing a little lap around his den, then going back in.The large aquarium is just amazing and beautiful. Lots of fish to see, and the large viewing area is great. We also enjoyed the passage way where the fish swim over you.We took in the dolphin and seal show, which was ok. We did a couple of rides, which were also ok. We took the gondola back to the entry, which was nice, as you get a very nice view of the park and surrounding areas.We decided to eat at one of the restaurants at the top, close to the cable cars, and the food was good, however extremely expensive. We spent $500 for lunch for 3 people, including my son's plate. I'd recommend eating somewhere else, at some of the stands along the way, or the McDonald's we later found out was in the park.Overall, this was a great day and we really enjoyed ourselves. Definitely a recommended visit!"

Convenient to go there on your own even without a tour guide as the transportation everywhere in HK is reliably efficient. The food are a bit pricey though and not much choice especially for the kids. The big aquarium is overwhelming. Overall, this theme park is not only for the kids but for the adults as well who seeks for thrill. Will definitely check this again when I come back to HK."

We loved the aquarium and the pandas, such a nice mix to go with all the rides. Though avoid on public holidays!!! We went around Chinese New Year and there was a 45minute queue just to get into the aquarium.Very easy to get to via public transport by Metro (we went from the train / bus station Hung Hom) and then from the metro station you get a very cheap shuttle bus to the park. An awesome place to visit though you definitely need the whole day!!! and stay late as it empties out of all the familes and you can walk on the rides with practically no queueing after about 7ish."

Ocean Park was wicked hyped up and recommended to me from almost every local I met. I had to go see what all the fuss was about. It's HK's version of Seaworld + an amusement park. Even on a weekday, there was long lines to get everywhere. There are animals you can see, an aquarium you can go in and also a show you can watch. The amusement park side had few rides and again long lines. It is a fun place to go with friends but for me, it was not worth all the hype. If you're bored, I guess it's better than staying in all day."

Yes, it was extra busy and you have to queue for almost everything (be prepared for sharp elbows) but i think it was worth it. Most of the package tours arrives mid-late afternoon but they are usually gone by the 4-5pm. By then, the queues for the rides are short and the exhibitions are almost empty. The new aquarium is not as good as the old one, in my opinion, but very spectacular nonetheless. I also like the walruses, but the Chinese sturgeons are very creepy.Bring a bottle of water with you as it is expensive to buy one in there. There are a number of places you can refill your bottle for free, but i can only remember the one next to the penguin enclosure. Food is ok, you can get a good size sandwich with fresh salad for hk$50. Bring some sweets and chocolate, it's a long day with lots of walking.Oh, try to go on the mine train after sunset.

If you go, I would suggest to go on a weekday, instead of a weekend to avoid long queues, and maybe go for two days so you can do things a bit more relaxed and see everything. The highlights were definitely seeing the pandas, and the light show at the end of the day.

This was the first time I have seen the park at night and even this is a sight well worth staying for.Now several breeds of penguin and a couple of arctic foxes have joined the animal on display in the park. Be warned though that both the penguin and arctic fox areas are very cold, but on a warm day it does make a pleasant place to spend a few cooling minutes.

Since this is the highlight of the park, the show should be packed with more interesting stunts and acts. Perhaps incorporate seals and penguins with the Dolphins. It was nothing new and should be updated. The staff were experienced in crowd control and ushering.More food carts with greater variety would be appreciated to add to the enjoyment of the show nearby the Dolphin theatre.

The dolphin show and aquarium are good but usually very crowded so make sure you get there earlier. I would suggest to avoid going on weekends or any public holidays. The food is TERRIBLE and waaaaay over-priced. Virtually nothing healthy and all junk food. There is an enclosure they call the panda \"sanctuary\". I use quotations here because it is FAR from being a sanctuary. The pandas are isolated in separate enclosed areas not much bigger than a tennis court and are on display to the public through glass windows that are open at the top. Before entering there is a person who holds up a sign that reads: \"please be silent and no camera flash allowed\". But dont think that this can stop people from doing exactly that, screaming to eachother and taking pictures with their obnoxious flashing cameras disturbing these poor animals. Very sad."

Took 629 from Admiralty MTR Station, bought the entrance tickets there, and within 20 mins we reached Ocean Park. This place has everything - Animals, Sea-Life, Rides. Being with very young children (4 and 1 year old) we knew very few rides were suited for them on the other side of the cable-car ride, so we spent a good half a day checking out the animals like pandas, aquarium, goldfishes, etc. There ARE kiddie rides here, and our older one had a good time on the train ride, drove the RC Car, carousel, etc. They were close to being empty as most visitors are there for the thrill ride.We enjoyed the cable car ride but not the 1 hour queue. On the other side, we went to the Ocean Theatre 10 mins before showtime and still we couldn't enter as the huge amphitheatre was full! We had to stand and catch the show from a corner. Be here at least 30 minutes they say.The rides on this side are meant for taller kids and teenagers up. Our child could only take the Artic Blast as he was exactly 100cm, the minimum required height.We took him on it twice, and two times the staff have to measure him! The other ride which I think he can take would be the Ferris Wheel but we had run out of time. Do check out the North & South pole exhibits - sea-lions, seals, penguins and we saw warluses swimming above us. Lots of up and down hill walking between the 'old and new' part of the theme park.We were trying to beat 6pm closure time, and took the train down to the entrance to catch the Fountain show. While waiting, we had some snacks at Old Hong Kong - not good at all. We left and took a taxi instead of 629 as we saw the hordes all rushing for the bus and by then I was kind of spooked by crowds. We spent HKD66 to Admiralty where we stayed, quite affordable and convenient.This place is huge and it is quite impossible to catch everything, so plan ahead. Ocean Park is very crowded even on a Monday. 90% of the visitors are Mainland Chinese, and the tour groups come after lunch. Some will cut the queues and when confronted, will kick up a ruckus, so just have to bear with it. Ocean Park is definitely bigger and better than Disneyland. It is a good theme park and has something for everyone. The rides are amazing and the animal exhibits aplenty. Note that the helpful photograpghers will upsell you photos and sourvenirs, so if you do not want to feel obliged, say no fto their help. The curt and unsmiling service staff needs big improvement, and also make more effort to handle the queue jumpers."

Swimming with the seals was breath taking the staff and trainers were amazing people and the seals are beautiful special thanks to David the seal for letting us pat him and for his amazing temperament and tricks. The park is huge we didn't cover too much of the park as the weather was just too cold but we saw the aquariums, panda, penguins, snow foxes, and of course the seals all the animals had really clean and spacious houses and are well looked after. I would recommend doing the seal encounter prebook it online you won't regret a minute of it I certainly won't. Purchase a two day pass at the door and go around lunchtime.Thanks SEAL staff for an Amazing Experience!!!!!!"

I would say it is well maintain (first time visit but didn\u2019t really see a lot of thing that felt old or shabby), convenience, and the Dolphin show is cool! There are 2 ways to get to the Dolphin show area (by cable car or the train that has less queue and it\u2019s just 10mins! Somewhere before you reach the cable car area, something call Ocean train\u2026)The aquarium is so over my expectation, the set up and the species there are great!

On a nostalgic visit to Hong Kong where I lived and worked for over 20 years - I hadn't been to Ocean Park since the early 1990s. I knew they had added a lot more attractions so as today was a bright and sunny (though cold) one I decided to go and see. I wish I hadn't. There were possibly thousands of mainly Chinese mainland tourists (some elderly Hong Kong groups) I queued half an hour to get in. I queued half an hour to get into the aquarium - which I didn't think was anything special. The Panda enclosure advertised a queue of 45 minutes and to get on the cable car 60 mins. This is at a time of year when it is not the peak tourist season. I won't go again and I would advise you not to. It's also expensive at HK320 for an adult ticket."

Upon arrival there, it was full of people. So full, that the lines for each ride were almost filling up the queue space. And there was no respect for the lines, people would just walk past you in the line to go until there was no more space. I eventually had to put up my arms to prevent people from walking past me. We had time to ride three roller coasters, and look at the penguins and seals before the park closed. We boarded the train back to the otherwise. It was total mayhem to get on. I recommend going in the morning, doing the roller coasters first, then making your way back to the zoo like area on the inland side."

            "review": "A 'Must\" on your Hong Kong Visit. Let me preface by saying we did not get a chance to go on any of the rides so I can't really comment on them. However, we did go on the carousel. The line which seemed intimidatingly long moved fairly quick since the ride literally is less than 2 minutes it seems. It felt like a rip off in some aspect but we just got back in line to appease the children. Also, we had a choice between Disney and Ocean Park and from what we were told, it was like a Hong Kong Seaworld. I didn't do my due diligence and look up reviews, but maybe that was a good thing since I was blown away with all there was to do there. Having already been to Disney in the US we opted to go to Ocean Park.My family and I visited Hong Kong at the peak of summer when it was scorching hot. In some instances, we dreaded going anywhere with the temperatures being so unbearable. However, we couldn't let the weather ruin our once in a life time trip! We have 2 toddlers ages 2 and 1 at the time. They knew just walking up to the place that there was some fun in store for them. Admission is pricey, but let me tell you its definitely worth it! Riding in the cable car and overlooking Hong Kong and the amusement park is worth the admission price alone. Even my father in-law who lives in Hong Kong believed so. It's a breathtaking view of the water and landscape. We spent the entire day there. I felt we had made a mistake going so early and closing the park but looking back, it was the right thing to do. It was difficult navigating with two small children especially when temperature and nap time play a huge factor but we trucked along and somehow made it work. After getting off the cable car at the top, we stopped to have lunch at the restaurant. The kids took a quick snooze while we took in the scene and enjoyed a few drinks. We spent most of the day just walking around viewing the attractions and taking plenty of pictures. It was just too extremely hot to do anything so anytime we could step indoors or get some shade we took advantage of the opportunity. We were upset that the Panda exhibit was down for maintenance during our visit. When will we ever get to see live Pandas again?? No matter, there was still so much more to see. My absolute favorite part of the park was the aquarium. They rival even the best ones here in the western hemisphere. I couldn't believe that I paid to get into an amusement park and got to experience this lovely aquarium. By this time it was dark and we kept hearing announcements to go to the lagoon located in the middle of the park for a special treat. Boy were we in for a treat! All I knew from other reports was that there would be a fireworks display. They have fireworks every night so of course we wanted to see the fireworks. What we weren't prepared for was their water/light show in their lagoon. I can't describe in words how awesome the show was, you'll just have to experience it for yourself if you ever get the good fortune of visiting Hong Kong. This is an all day trip, in fact if we ever go back to Hong Kong we will surely be visiting Ocean Park again. The only bad part about closing down the park is the rush to get on the bus. This process at night is long and tedious and of course if you're with kids they will be cranky. So be prepared and have a plan. If you're visiting Hong Kong, be prepared for 'line cutting'. This is looked down upon however, it happens... a lot! I was flabbergasted with the gall of some fully grown men/women cutting in front of small kids or even worse not offering a seat to a senior. This is a culture thing from the mainland, most people in Hong Kong have the decency to follow the rules. Its just shocking so be prepared to stand your ground. Overall, regardless of age, you're sure to have a great time at Ocean Park."

The environments that have been created are sensational and so interesting for all ages...young and old.

There is so much on offer that we just couldn't cover the whole park in one day, so decisions were made as to what was a priority....absolutely on top of the list and didn't disappoint was the cable car. The ride is slow and you see so much of the park and the surrounding country side.....spectacular views. We lucked the line up and only had to wait 10 minutes, but at other times of the day the line wait can be as long as 1 hour or more....Also did the large aquarium which we thoroughly enjoyed.

Glad to find out that this park is very unique.I went there on the eve of the Chinese New Year. Most of the tourists were from China Mainland.Went into the park at exactly 10am. Managed to the 1st few to take the Cable Car. The view was excellent. Knowing that it was impossible to visit all shows and take all rides in 1 day. I came up with a schedule of what rides to take and what shows to watch. I liked rides and hence completed the main roller coaster in the park : Hair Raiser, Arctic Blast and The Dragon. It was a new experience to take roller coaster rides and looking at the beautiful South China Sea. The lines were not very long. one of them was just a 5 min wait. The longest was about 30min. Could due be the timing. New Year eve is a typical reunion dinner day so not many HK locals there. Tried a few more rides like The Rapids, The Ocean Park Tower, and Bumper Blaster before going to a Dolphin show at Pacific Pier. All the rides were nice and well managed. I have a very good impression of Hong Konger.I found them very hardworking, dedicated and cheerful. I know Cantonese and that added to the fun. After spending most of the time at this side of the hill, I took the Cable Car back to the ground level and visited The Grand Aquarium, Old Hong Kong and Giant Panda Adventure.Managed to catch a ride on Ocean Express.Do not miss the Jelly Fish in the Aquarium ! Well presented by the park! The Roller Coaster, Jelly Fish and the Cable Car alone will worth the ticket price.Left the park at around 5pm to take the bus to the city.Had a wonderful day!Should have visited this park more than 10 years ago.I should have change my mindset that all the theme park are the same."

Best attractions: Cable Car, the Aquarium, Sea life carousel, Goldfish Treasures, Panda village, Sichuan Treasures, Pacific pier, the long escalator...etc.Try to avoid: The Old Hong Kong (what a waste of time), Ocean ExpressThe park is big and beautiful. It's located in south Hong Kong Island and next to the Deep Water Bay and it's easy to get to too. Although I have to say that it is not as good as before but I still highly recommend it to anyone.The only downside is the huge amount of Chinese tourists flooding from the Mainland. They don't like to queue and love spitting on the floor, speaking outloud and extremely impolite. They generate lots of income but also destroy the image of Ocean Park at the same time. They would scare the tourists from the rest of the world away.Tips: try to avoid weekend and public holiday"

So I guess the healthy and safety executive at Ocean Park has decided that even the mildest of rides get the 1.2m height bar even 1.3m height bar.What am I talking about? Attended with 1.0m tall child 4 year old and she could practically ride ON NOTHING. So our experience was seriously cut down to just watching other people riding.In Europe I think we may be just a bit braver because the exact same rides are available over here and most kids 1.0m tall get to ride them! We are not exactly talking the Days of Thunder Terminator Wheels to Hell Fire Storm Rollercoster or whatever names they call them. We are talking about TEA CUPS and GENTLE log rides. So why have Ocean Park run scared? Maybe its the litigation or the fears of safety. Anyway once we realised we could ride absolelty NOTHING all we could do was watch others or go see fish in tanks. No worries here because the place is huge and we enjoyed the expanse.Just know the place is very hilly and if you are not on your A game it will kill you (Me pushing buggy - It killed me) but I feel fitter for it and burnt the callories up.OK so its mostly a rant but we did enjoy the place so I dont want to spoil their ranking by marking them down but I did want to let of steam to say to the management come on and sort out the thrill rides for the smallest...You COULD do it if you wanted to."

Heaps of rides at the top of the mountain (where we spent most of the day) of varying intensity depending on personal preference. Best strategy I would say is to go up to the top early on cable car and then come back down on the train late afternoon. Whirly bird, bumper car, the rapids and rev booster had the biggest lines during the day so get to these early. Most other rides had 5-10 minute lines which is no problem.

For Ocean Park it was 20% discount for adult, about 22% for kids. Tickets were issued immediately for Ocean Park, and they gave discount vouchers for various food and merchandise outlets, i.e. buy $50 of food and $15 discount etc so really worth it. The most convenient way to reach CTS travel, at HK International Airport Terminal 1, Exit Gate A, opposite the gate will be 10-12 travel booths, look for China Travel Service. They also provide discount to Disneyland but discount was only about 5%, still a saving nonetheless. CTS only accept cash unless transaction > HKD3k.Our second visit to Ocean Park since 4 years ago, the Summit is where all the exciting rides are. We went during a rainy day on a Monday, so not much of queue. Advisable to take the cable car as view is really nice, and cable car service could be stopped if weather does not permit. Also explore the Summit and try all the rides before lunch hour. We see large tour groups, mostly from China, after 2pm. Immediately the queues for rides lengthened. Mind you, it's not only one group, easily 6-10 groups that arrive together, judging by the different flags the tour leaders were holding.Exciting rides for teenagers are Hair Raiser, the Dragon, Abyss, the Eagle etc. Didn't try the Rapids as it was really cold, kids wanted to try Whirly Bird but was halted due to bad weather. For Ocean Theatre's dolphin show, it's not that exciting if you have been to the Sea World in Gold Coast, but good for first timer I guess.Ocean Park is quite a big park, Adventure Land at the Summit was also closed while we were there and yet we spent almost 6 hours at the Summit, including lunch and exploring the animals at marine centre and Polar Adventure. We visited the Panda and Grand Acqurium only later in the evening, took the train down as cable car service was halted due to strong wind. The Grand Aquarium was really well done as part of the package for the Park, in other places one may have to pay just to view these marine species.Overall, food is cheaper and tastier in Ocean Park than Disneyland. The park is becoming more popular after the upgrades, with more rides, more shows and more opportunities to interact with the animals, i.e. the Marine mammal breeding centre. Really worth the price to spend a full day there."

I went to Ocean Park in August 2006 and had a blast - Ocean Park had a strong focus on aquariums, with many theme park rides and some theme park-like displays to go along with it. Not to mention, the amazing views from the gondola! Things have changed a bit since 2006, though. When travelling there in January this year I found the park to be much more artificial - it's started to feel like Disneyland with animals. In spite of this there are some excellent displays, and there's a good focus on sustainability, with many signs urging patrons to reconsider their own activities (consumption of shark fin soup, use of bamboo chopsticks, energy use etc). Unfortunately I think I was the only one who read these signs.Some exhibits are a little depressing - some large Arctic seals in a tiny enclosure surrounded by electric wire doesn't really fill you with joy, and in peak season there can be a long wait for almost anything - aquarium exhibits, rides, the gondola, even food. Be prepared for mayhem if you go on a weekend or school holidays!Before going look out for discount coupons for entry, they seem to be everywhere. There was a sign at the Kowloon Star Ferry pier which suggested if you took a photo of it and presented it on entry you get a 10% discount. Most tourism booklets seemed to have a 15% discount voucher as well."

Every ride has a place to store your stuff, and it is quite secure because it is separated from the rest of the public and watched by their staff. Some of the best (aka scariest) rides are the hair-raiser, abyss, the flash, and the mine train. Would recommend going on weekdays to avoid most of the queues. We went on a weekday noon and most of the rides only required 5 to 10 minutes of queueing. When it was evening though, the crowd had ballooned and the waiting time had increased to 15 minutes to 30 minutes.

However, the shows now are all cut short and it's become more of an amusement park than an aquarium like it was in the past. It definitely looks very beautiful and if you don't go to Cheng Du this is a great chance to see a panda.However, it feels like a big shopping mall now with rides. Good to go with kids. Also, don't go on the 629 from admiralty...the line...was really long could take 2 hours to get on a bus to ocean park.Take the 171 from Mong Kok to Ocean Park."

This is one charming adventure after the next, and for a park a few decades old, amazingly contemporary. if you're a local, and especially if you have kids, get the season pass - pays for itself very quickly. In short, Ocean Park has all the rides and animals you could ever want, and you can easily conquer it in five/six hours. My daughter's favorite attraction is the penguins and the bird show - they never get old, and very personable experiences with the animals who seem happy and healthy. the kids section at OP is a special treat - if you're a local, you can go just for that - it's nicely tailored for young kids (rides, games, etc.) and has different themes throughout the year. Ocean Park will always have a special place in my heart because I've been there so often with my young daughter."

I read, before our trip, that the food is atrocious and very expensive etc, etc. But at the end of every road, is a golden arches... So it seems! The trick to the McDonalds at Ocean Park is that they only offer an a la carte menu, which means you need to purchase all menu items separately and they don't offer meals as such. This means that you're paying a little bit more. HOWEVER, if you're Australian, your food bill still ends up being cheaper than what you would pay for at home anyway! Enjoy!"

If you have kids, visit the animal enclosures and also plan out which animal shows to go to. Go early for good seats. If you prefer thrilled rides, take the cable car up as there's nice sea view.

The first time I have been to Ocean Park, I thought that it would be like any other park with basic attractions like roller coaster and so on. I have now to admit that every time I go to Hong Kong I end up there. In 5 years, they have significantly upgraded the park and the latest attraction with the penguins is just awesome. Going into a close to zero room in the heat of HK watching these penguins swimming (the fact that you can see below the water surface is just the idea of a genius) is enough to entertain you. The major attraction is in fact the giant and red pandas. Difficult to see the same and so many elsewhere in Asia apart going to Chengdu. Add the new massive aquarium, dolphins shows, some cheap and good HK style food and somehow a relaxing atmosphere, a cable car with a view and you will have a nice place to spend some time. Needless to say that it is a paradise for kids of any age; one side of the hill is more relaxed whereas the over has some thrilling attractions. Unlike Disney, you will not find big parades; American style it ain\u2019t. Do not miss some specials: feeding the otters or the pandas. And you can do more, like having private session to swim with the dolphins or learn more about the pandas and feed them yourself and receive a Panda ambassador certificate. Ocean park is also about learning. If possible do not go on weekends as it tends to be packed."

Ocean Park is a very Big park and have alot of attractions so please have atleast one full Day. Please Book in Advance online as you may get alot of discounts and some good deals. Moreoever you will avoid queuing for buying tickets which can take from 30 mins to an hour depending on the day. Plan for weekdays would be a better idea,The Park Opens at 10am till 9pm so plan to be there early so you can cover Everything in one Day. The park is spread into multiple areas and have Thrill rides to Animal Shows so pick your best Bet first.As soon as you enter the Park, Bunch of people will approach you to click your pics with the background and offer you souvenier for $400. They are very quick in service and can easily convince you but i didn't find it worth spending this money. We covered Aquarium and it was worth the visit with many species in collection. As the Park is very Big, We decided to start backwards so we made our way to the Rides at Adventure Park. Please note that While they have escalators to move around the Hill, you have to walk a bit so be prepared with the Family. All the Rides are worth even for Kids, my 6 years old kid enjoyed the park more than Disney Land and was allowed to go in most of the rides as the minimum Height requirement is 48 Inches Tall. (Plan Accordingly if you are travelling with Kids)Hair Raiser, Flash is a must for Adults :) Though most of the rides are very nice.While we could not cover the complete park in 9 hours. 12 to 9pm, it was worth a visit and i will recommend to everyone to spend a day at Ocean Park for complete Fun :)."

The entire theme park is a myriad of thrills, from the roller-coasters and rides. We dined at Tuxedos Restaurant, which is quite an alternate experience. The seating offers a view of over 70 penguins, which are quite funny to watch as you eat. The price of food is a little expensive, as you would expect from a park restaurant, but very filling and delicious.

But everything else in this park was the same old stuff - not sure if its because we have seen the gorgeous zoo in Singapore or the worlds largest Oceanirum - we just weren't fazed about anything. Worst park was walking into the area that was full of kids games (show games) and of course they all wanted to play and each game was $10-$50HKD! Ocean Park is spread on 2 mountains and lucky we went in the winter because we would have been absolutely buggered had it been hot! Again just like all theme parks in HK the wait time and line ups for rides was insane - at least 60mins wait so the kids missed out but they loved the cable car ride down (in which I kept my eyes shut!) Way way too scary for me, and much scarer then the Ping 360 to Big Buddha which I thought was absolutely terrifying (that's another review hehe) I wouldn't go back to Ocean Park and I wouldn't really recommend it unless you've never been to an aquarium or zoo"

The Tower Ride is great as it gives you an Arial View of the City..The roller coaster rides are amazing\u2026(This review was written by my 11 year old son)."

            "review": "A very good way to spend a day out with the family. Ocean Park is Hong Kong's home grown theme park and is located on the south side of Hong Kong Island. The park originally opened in 1977 and was the sole theme park in the territory until the arrival of Disneyland a decade again. In order to remain competitive with Disney, Ocean Park underwent a multi-year renovation and general upgrade of its facilities. The park has been further transformed by the addition of new and exciting attractions and wildlife experiences that have greatly enhanced the experience of spending a day at the park. Today, you can easily spend a whole day at Ocean Park enjoying traditional theme park rides, games and performances as well as aquatic and mammal experiences. In comparison to 10 years ago, Ocean Park is a more enjoyable theme park to visit and it might be even better in the future as an MTR station is being constructed outside the entry gate. There are hotel plans as well, which will provide guests with the ability to stay at/near Ocean Park in a few years time. What we most enjoy at Ocean Park: Being wildlife enthusiasts, we are quite biased towards the animal experiences and spend most of our time at these attractions and exhibits. In our opinion, the Grand Aquarium is great and really shouldn't be missed. Equally, the Amazing Asian Animals Area is well worth spending time. You are able to get closer to the younger pandas on display here and the red panda (fire foxes) are brilliant when they are active. We very much enjoyed watching the feeding session here recently. Resident pandas, An An and Jia Jia, are always worth seeing as well. They were the star attraction for us for many years before the arrival of the two younger pandas and other wildlife since 2007. Other enjoyable wildlife which you can experience include the previously mentioned red pandas (a present favourite of ours), as well as the arctic foxes, penguins, seals, sea lions and walrus, which can all be found in the North Pole and South Pole experience. There is a jellyfish exhibition, Chinese sturgeon exhibit and traditional animal performance shows that are worth checking out as well. A Shark encounter is presently being constructed and should be ready later in 2014. A special mention here for the cable car experience is deserved. Many visitors to Hong Kong are eager to enjoy the Ngong Ping 360 cable car experience on Lantau Island but lack the time to make that visit and Ocean Park. Not to worry, the cable car ride at Ocean Park is very good. You scale a mountain and then transverse its side until you reach the Summit terminus. This ride offers you very nice views of the Hong Kong coastline. While not the same as Ngong Ping 360 experience, it is a very good consolation for those who don't have time to do all the major attractions in Hong Kong, and some will even argue that this cable car ride is better than its more famous peer on Lantau Island. Its a very pleasant surprise to your visit to Ocean Park and is included in the price of your entry ticket. Overall, we very much enjoy Ocean Park and highly recommend it to visitors to Hong Kong. Compared to theme parks elsewhere, the entry fee is reasonable and then entire park is family friendly. The classic theme park rides and activities are as fun as you'd expect and the wildlife experiences are unique and very enjoyable, providing fun for adults and children alike. Tip: You can find a park map as well as a complete and comprehensive list of attractions on the Ocean Park online website. Maps and performance show / feeding time schedules are also available within the park, conveniently located at stands near the ticket purchase booths at the park entrance. It is well worth looking over the schedule to help organise how you want to send your time within the park. Animal feeding sessions don't last long (5-10 minutes) so its important to be in the right spot at the right time if you want to watch. Tip: Due to a vast increase in tourists coming to Hong Kong these days, Ocean Park, like other major attractions in Hong Kong can be very crowded. As such, in order to maximise your time, we suggest buying your tickets before arrival (tickets can be purchased at 711s or at the ticket booth next to the bus 629 stand at Admiralty). Then, arrive at the park around 30 minutes prior to opening time so you can enjoy as many of the rides and attractions as possible before the crowds swell and potentially make you feel less comfortable. This is how to help maximise your time in the park. Tip: At present, our preferred way to travel to Ocean Park is to take bus 629 from Admiralty, where you can also buy your park entry tickets (HK$320 per adult). There are plenty of buses making this route and the journey is direct, taking 10-15 minutes to journey."

I visited Ocean Park a few days after Christmas, with all of the holiday attractions still in place.Ocean Park tries to provide something for everyone and succeeds in a big way. The scenery while riding the cable car is breathtaking. Pandas, a recreation of Old Hong Kong, a stage show,rides, giant aquarium, animal shows and all topped off with special Christmas presentations, including a children's choir singing carols in English.The admission price (HK 320) is reasonable and despite huge holiday crowds, even getting there and back was easy on the beautiful double-decker bus 629 leaving from the Admiralty stop on the MTR. A tip: Later in the day there may be a long line (queue) to ride up on the cable car. Go early to ride up and then ride down-where there was no line (queue)-later in the day.Definitely worth a whole day and if you have kids, will want to go back again."

Saves a lot of time when u queue early. Later on, use either the cable car or the ocean express train to travel back. We managed to take the cable car ride to and fro, and the same applies for the ocean express train. Once on the other side, go for the ocean tower ride. It gives u a bird's eye view of the whole ocean park & it's scenic surroundings. Check out the feeding time for the pandas. Go for the Panda exhibit near the ocean express train station, near the main entrance of the park. It's more close up. There's also another panda exhibit cross the mountain, together with a monkey exhibit. That is not so interesting as the pandas are kept behind the glass exhibits and u have to follow the queue of people. I think most people missed the panda exhibit I mentioned. It's the best time for picture taking when they are munching on the bamboo leaves. We were lucky to see one feeding. The other was sleeping like a log. You have to be there as early as you can before the crowd sets in. We enjoyed the peaceful walk on the other side of the mountain as we were one of the earliest to arrive. It's a combination of a zoo & amusement park. Check out the ocean theatre performance. Take bus 629 from Admiralty MTR. Buy your park entrance tickets there, so u don't have to queue at the ticket counter outside the park later. Can use octopus card to pay for the bus ride, about 20min . Plan for a whole day there to enjoy the rides and various exhibits."

The Cable Car ride was very good with excellent views, we went for it straight away and the queuing time was 15 minutes. Both Dolphin show and Bird Show were poor in comparison to other dolphin and bird shows that I have seen, hope Ocean Park address these as a priority. Aqua Adventure Show was really good. We booked tickets online with Grayline Tours which included tickets, hotel pick-up and drop-off. We reached at 10am when the Park opened and left at 6pm when the Park closes, it is not possible to cover everything in 1 day but for me 1 day in this park is enough. Make sure you get the show timetable at the Park Entrance and my tip is to organize your day around the shows. I would say do a show straight away after using the cable car instead of going on the dodgem ride as we missed the North Pole show. Pulled out the Ferris Wheel Ride queue after 5 minutes as it would have taken an hour to get to the front of the queue. No fast pass system available in this Park. Not enough rides for under 10 year old kids. Panda enclosure and feeding time was worth seeing."

Then to finish the day off we enjoyed a light, water and fire show outside the aquarium at around 7pm. There is a map & show schedule in English as well as Chinese as you walk into the entrance. The map is a definite as the park is so big. They are currently building a metro station for the park, but it is easy to get too by metro & then bus. We got a taxi there which was reasonable price & then took bus & metro back to our hotel in Kowloon. There are signs as you exit the park to the bus station or taxis which ever you would prefer.

            "review": "great!. Before going I read that it tries to be a zoo, aquarium and theme park but is a bit of a jack of all trades master of none.This might be true but also allows for a bit of variety rather than being forced to have only one of the above and hence quite an enjoyable day out overall.Highlights - some of the 'thrill rides' were quite good and definitely more thrilling than the Disney rides in Tokyo Disneyland/sea and by extension possibly Disneyland HK? Namely hair raiser, dragon, flash, mine train to name a fewPandas were great, really enjoyed the arctic/antarctic exhibits, the aquarium, jellyfish and the dolphin show.tips - like all theme parks get there early as it is busy - weekdays preferred - go to the website beforehand to get an idea when the animal feeding times are. Write them down or screen capture it if you have no phone internet on premises. - dolphin show was pretty popular people noted to grab a seat early although latecomers still were able to find seats when I went - cable car always has a long queue. Possibly avoid by taking the train and noting the peak times (queue FROM the entrance huge in the morning, queue AWAY from the entrance huge in the evening- plan accordingly)  - I don't know where people were pre-buying tickets because the line for the tickets at admiralty station wasn't short - even on what was a pretty busy day things massively quietened down in the last couple hours after the chinese tour buses went away and the families with small children went home. Great time for rides especially the thrill ones. Had literally no wait and squeezed in like 4 rides in the space of an hour including a repeat of mine train which I waited an hour for during the day. - there are a few rotten apples amongst the tourists so bringing a sense of humor is mandatory - there is a fair bit of walking as the park is huge even for a theme park so wear comfortable shoes - we saw a few disgruntled single riders who went on slower than the normal ride"

This is a low cost and efficient ride to Ocean Park. For overseas travellers, you may get a discount on the admission ticket (normal price adult HK$320) when you present your airline boarding pass or the passport.Getting to the park by 10.00 am allowed us to spend a longer day there and was able to enjoy the many fun rides and shows. The most remarkable one was the Hair Raiser(super roller coaster) and the least challenging one should be the cable car ride. You need to just sit back and relax and watch the view below you. Not bad.Ocean Park facilities are great and well maintained. The public bathroom and rest area are clean and tidy. To save time and money, if you need to... you can also pack your favourite lunch and eat on the go. We felt the dolphins show was just average ~ 15 minutes of show time. Also watching the pandas eating and playing around in the enclosure may give one some entertainment. Yet it is not everyone's liking to watch animals in enclosed area.Overall, it was an interesting place filled with activities and sights and of course, the crowd. Rated 4 out of 5."

I wish we really tuck to our plan to go there before lunch time, so we could've seen more shows and tried more rides! The aquarium and the pandas are cute and educational, but don't take long going through them, because the real fun awaits when the cable car takes you over at the other side of the mountain! We queued for the cable car for about 45 minutes, and this was on a Monday (I bet the lines would be longer on weekends and holidays), so make sure you allot time for this. Otherwise you can just take the tram, which is faster, but not as fun!Adrenaline junkies will love Thrill Mountain! Go first for The Flash, which wasn't nearly as terrifying as it looked! You'd think you'd freak out from swinging 360 degrees hundreds of feet up in the air--but no, it was actually my most favorite! Hair Raiser comes a close second. The Abyss was the bomb! It isn't for the faint-hearted! And if you're scared of heights, be sure to pick out a seat facing away from the cliff and the sea ;)We wanted to have another go at the rides but by 6 pm everyone was already wrapping up! In the end we didn't even see the sea lion shows, because there was just so little time walking and queuing from one ride to the next!This is definitely a must-try Hong Kong experience! I think most of the hostels sell discounted tickets, we got ours from the hostel we were staying at. Be sure to bring bottled water (because they cost thrice as much inside the park!) and go there before lunch time!"

As we approached the ticket counter to confirm the dolphin experience for 6 of our party of 15, we were met by ms sing who was in charge of education. She was very accommodating and welcoming. As the experience with the dolphins began I thought it would only be for a few minutes. It turned out to be more than an hour which was worth the fees.

            "review": "the new aquarium is a real disappointment. I used to live in HK and visited Ocean park many times over a 12 year span. 3 years later, we visited again on holiday from the UK. There's lots to do and many more rides (for those who like them). But for me, the new aquarium is not a touch on the old Atoll Reef which was world class and contained the best selection of fishes I've ever seen. Why they have replaced it with something much less interesting I have no idea. The old sea lion enclosures were also so much better than the dark & gloomy ones they have now. I remember the sea lions swimming playfully up to the underwater viewing panels giving visitors a real treat. As another reviewer mentioned, since the influx of mainland Chinese into HK in recent years, this and Disneyland is now swarming with ill-mannered, pushy, rowdy visitors, and queuing for attractions takes so much longer. And it has become excessively commercialized within the park, and visitors can expect to part with at least HK$800 - 1200 each. That includes the entrance fee, a meal (around HK$120) photographs (HK$198 for one) drinks (HK$26 for a 500ml bottle of coke) and lots of opportunities to part with more cash on fairground type stalls.The cable car ride is still going, thankfully, and is well worth the wait to get on board. But they've added the Ocean Express train as an alternative.In my opinion, the arrival of Disney has forced Ocean park operators to enhance the park in order to meet the competition. But in so doing, they have lost some of the best attractions that they were well known for.The dolphin / sea lion show wasn't as spectacular as I've seen here before, but still worth a visit. We arrived at the 3.30 show 15 mins early, but all the seats were taken already. So do arrive well in time or you'll be standing a long way back."

From many reviews, we understand that Ocean Park is of much better facilities than Disney Land. Well, it is certainly not disappointing.The fist place we visited was the aquarium, compare to SEA aquarium in Singapore, it is relatively pale with less variety. But it compensates with some exotic species like hammer head sharks, deep sea organisms such as Nautilus, glow fishes.Visitors are poilt for choices when come to amusement rides, the place is divided into a few sections with each having its share of equipments, enough to fill your urge for excitements. Because of our wide spread of ages, we did not manage all the facilities, which to me is a little unfortunate. Anyway, I don't think we van finish all the games neither even if we arre on our own.,One disappointment though, orca was taken off the menu, and also because of the huge influx of Chinese visitors, the place became very croweded, and Chinese visitors are a rowdy bunch. Imagine that I was only there after more than 12 years of absence, and I can witness a fight simply because 2 parties compete for view space. It certainly does not reflect well about China's image."

We got a cheaper ticket from the Chinese Travel Agent at the Airport (recommended by a great lady at the Hong Kong Tourism Board) and headed off on public transport to the park.We alighted at Central Station and got the bus to Ocean Park. All very efficient. Entry to the park was quick and painless and we were soon running around the park having a ball. To go from one area to another it was a delight to take the cable car. What an experience in itself. So many rides to entertain a 9 year old, although she is a bit of a daredevil! Only downside was waiting to go in for lunch at Tuxedos. It was a great meal but there were 30 people in the queue before us, and this was at three in the afternoon. Once we were seated we had a great view of the penguins - both swimming and feeding.Great day, and one that would be enjoyed by many, especially those who like the thrill of roller coasters and rides that frighten the living daylights out of you!"

The park is less crowded than the Disneyland, we always choose to enter the park at 10AM before busses with mainland tourists arrive. The asian animals are always amazing and we love the pandas. We choose to take the train to the other part of the park and watch dolphins show, and then take the cable car ride down, no queue at all. I always wonder why most people do not do/think that ;) There is plenty of small rides/playground for toddlers next to the Panda area. I would say i see more local HK families with kids during both visits than in Disneyland.Location is just 10 min ride with bus from Admiralty station, and i saw a new MTR station being completed, would be perfect!The only less issue is there are park photographers offering taking family pictures with our camera and then they use their own camera for \"commercial purpose\"Best place to visit in Hong Kong with young family."

The cable car ride is a must - there were really long queues for the cable car ride when we arrived and we noticed they were not filling up the cable cars hence the queue was moving very slowly. We would have probably waited 90 mins or more so we took the express train to the other side - takes about 400 passengers hence no waiting. Good selection of rides on that end but more geared for older children. Once we were done exploring that side and seeing the penguins and sea life we took the cable car across. The queue was much shorter - approx 15 minutes. We only managed to see one panda bear but my son was thrilled and that was the highlight of the day for him."

This was our second time in the park, though our first visit was 10 years ago. The park has changed a lot since then. Our favorite attraction was the Dolphin show which is a must-see for everyone who visits. We were fortunate to be visiting with a annual pass holder member so we had VIP seating for several of the shows. This was very convenient as the VIP seats as dead center and in a special area with security staff who checks. You need to acquire a VIP ticket from Guest Relations at the beginning of the day and arrive at the theater/showcase for your selected time. We also enjoyed the Arctic exhibition with the penguins. Very cute and charming. Most of the rollercoasters were fun, but sadly on the day that we went the Mine Train and the Dragon were both out of commission due to maintenance repairs. The pandas were fun to see but they were sleeping when we went so it wasn't very exciting. If you arrive around 2:30-4pm at the Panda cafe you can experience a super good deal for $98HK which includes a BBQ pork noodle with orange juice and a ice cream. It's better than any other food deals they have available. They call this the \"tea set\" lunch. We spent the whole day there from 10am til closing 6pm, and we were treated with a incredible water illusion show at the end of the night. We were also impressed with the massive gift shop that is in the Summit. We found lots of goodies there."

It's a combination of an aquarium, a zoo, and an amusement park, as a result the place is huge so you most likely won't cover them all. You would be mistaken if you think you are getting all 3 for the price of 1. The one saving grace was the cable car. Highly recommended, although may not worth it if the queue is too long.There were very little sitting places and these were in high demand. It's not easy even getting a quick bite to eat at the concession stands because the seats were mostly taken by tired people resting there. The shows felt forced and tired, and I do not enjoy being lectured on while on vacation, even if the message is positive.Beware if you intend to take a taxi back at the end of the day; it's very poorly coordinated, and you could be waiting forever."

Highlight of these tourists would definitely be at the grand aquarium. Even though there were signage placed outside the aquarium for visitors to refrain from using flash photography, almost all these tourists were taking pictures of the marine animals with flash and when they were told by the staff not to use flash, they merely brushed it away and continued snapping pictures away."

So we went.I love animals, and seeing them up close. Don't get me wrong, I feel for them being locked in a cage, but a lot of times places like this are also rehabilitating animals or learning about them, I have no idea if this place was, but I like to tell myself that anyway. There was a dolphin and seal show, it was OK. The jellyfish exhibit was pretty great. They had an arctic pavillion with some penguins, arctic foxes and other animals. There were a ridiculous amount of animals to see, it would take you all day to see them all. I guess for me the big attraction was that they had about 5 pandas, and it's the first time (i think) that I have seen pandas. Turns out they're a bit of a let down. They just sit around and eat bamboo leaves all day and barely move. Still very cute.The rollercoasters were nothing special, but luckily the day we went had pretty low lines, so we went on a few.I would say it's worth it."

In addition to the cost, you will have to pay HKD$100 refundable security deposit.There are many parts to the park and it does make for a long day, so do try and plan in advance, taking timing between shows (if it is shows you want) into consideration otherwise you may find you are late for the start or may even miss it altogether.Some excellent rides for all ages at the theme parks with a number of rollercoaster rides. 2 different areas for rides. One for teens/adults, and one for children. You need to make sure you are in the right area for you. Consult the Park map, its dead easy.Both areas are separated by a mountain and are connected by both cable car and a train. Beware!! If you leave it too late on the far side of the park, you may find you will have to leave the park on that side and get a taxi back round to the main entrance. (if you need to meet anybody on that side)Plenty of food and drink inside, but does get a little pricey. There is no reason why you can't take a picnic, kids love 'em. So go to the local supermarket, it all adds to the fun. Plenty of places to plonk down and get stuck into the sandwiches!An altogether great day out!!"

He was lying right next to the dome, with his big eyes staring at you only a few cm away!! We caught the cable car up to the top, it was a good ride. Not many queues for the rides early, but be prepared for lots of walking up/down steep paths. By early afternoon we were ready to return to the lower section to view the pandas, gold fish and the indoor aquarium. What a shock! It was like grand final day at the MCG. There were hundreds of tour groups from mainland China, all of whom had no concept of queing or waiting their turn to see anything. It was impossible to see anything, without being pushed over, by aggresive Chinese tourists. My young sons have bright red and blonde hair, and found constantly being touched and photographed a bit unsettling. We won't be back."

The summit and waterfront are perched upon two different mountains and the views which you get while on the cable car are to die for. Absolutely stunning location. Apart from that, there are so many rides that you would probably have to skip some by the end of the day, so plan well in advance. Make sure to make it a priority to go for all the shows. The animal enclosures are fascinating. Loved the Panda adventure and the Penguins at the North Pole. All the main rides are up on the summit and there is a long line for the Cable Car, so make sure you cover the waterfront as soon as you can and join the line. We were unlucky to have missed the Hair raiser and Dragon as they were closed due to heavy wind. Also, three more rides were under maintenance which left us dissapointed. Make sure you avoid going here on a windy day. However, the other rides and shows more than made up for the missed ones, especially Abyss and Flash. If you are a Vegetarian, you'll have a hard time here as there is rarely anything veg here so carry something to eat in advance. That apart, I had a wonderful time here and this is undoubtedly one of the best parks in the world and is on par with the Hong Kong Disneyland.

Staff there are very friendly, and the various exhibits etc are very interesting. Worth checking out some of the shows that they have, but make sure you grab a Show Guide as the times may vary. You also have the option of the Cable Car or the Express to get between the two main areas of the Park so suggest the Cable Car up and then the Express back to mix it up. Highly recommend it, even for adults. We just felt like big kids again. If you're adults, would choose this over Disneyland as plenty more options when it comes to rides and various attractions."

Avoid the weekend as there are a lot of people. Afterwards, one can go to the Thai restaurant on the beach in Deepwater Bay, a couple of minutes by taxi from the Park."

            "review": "A COMPLETE PACKAGE FOR ME!. We went there on the 25-28th October 2013. We used Citybus 973 from Chungking Mansion,Nathan Road,Tsim Sha Tsui for HKD13.6/pax and took the bus at New World Center point(near to Avenue of Stars). We had great view of HK residential along the way and we used Citybus 90 for the return journey and dropped off at Wan Chai.This Citybus 90 also go to Central and the fare is cheaper compared to 629 bus.Ocean Park was really big and luckily they got Cable car so we didn't have to walk back to the entrance and at the same time got opportunity to enjoy beautiful ocean view. Upon entering the entrance, Ocean Park people offered to help us to take our picture.And then again with his camera.He said its nothing and if we like it,we can buy it. But then when they printed out the pictures and made it into the keychain, we couldn't resist to see how cute that things were.We decided to buy it and cost us HKD188.We learnt our lesson so the next time these people wanted to take our picture,we just passed it.I am not that brave,so I just played Raging River(log flume),the Rapids(water raft) and Artic Blast. Artic Blast was like a mini roller coaster but really gave me a thrill. hehehe. However my husband did try for the Dragon and when I asked how's he feeling.he just said he felt nauseous.Maybe he wanted to make me feel good.We enjoyed watching Penguins at South Pole and Pandas. They were really cute. We also managed to watch Dolphin Show at Ocean Park Theater.It was Halloween fest when we came so there was K-Pop Madness haunted house.The zombies liked to hide and shocked us when we were about to arrive.Its creative though.We are muslim and I think Ocean Park just recently launched its Halal restaurant. But since we wanted to keep us easy to move around, we brought lots of food and 2 bottles of mineral water.We even packed ourselves tuna sandwiches and we actually brought all the food from our country Malaysia."

Previously it had looked a little tired. We went of a Friday and even then is was fairly busy, but we understand on the weekend it is much worse with long queues. We bought our entry tickets ((HK$320 per adult) with our return CityBus ticket from the Ocean Park ticketing office close to the MTR Admiralty Station (Exit B). The cost or the return bus ticket was HK$10.60. For us, the major attraction is still seeing the pandas. You can just stand there admiring & watching them, and occasionally getting the great photo. We were a little disappointed with the north polar adventure as we were expecting to see a polar bear given the promo material at the entrance to this exhibit ... all we saw were a few different types of seals & walruses. We had lunch at Tuxedos which is next to the penguin display and were able to watch the penguins at play through a glass wall ... great for the kids. Unfortunately, we found the food just average. Plenty to do for the \"bigger kids\" with all the amusement rides up on Thrill Mountain. The cable car ride provides great views of Deep Water Bay & Repulse Bay areas and certainly worth the trip."

We also loved taking the gondola up to the areas at the top of the park where we went on a variety of rides and through antarctic exhibitions.

Definitely go on a weekday, it was crowded but the lines for the rides moved at a faster rate. I avoided the aquarium and the shows since I have been to and seen one too many, but on my way to the exit (we took an exit only meant for groups usually, which was a blessing since there were far less people), there was a dolphin habitat which we entered only to be able to watch these beautiful creatures in their \"home\" pools relaxing and playing with the trainers."

It's a shame its so hard to negotiate as a new visitor.We only had one day, and we did purposely avoid Friday/Saturday or Sunday, but still found it quite busy.Getting there was fairly straight forward using MTR to Admiralty then bus 629 to the park. We brought our park tickets at the bus station.While we were at the lower level, we visited the Panda Village, but not a lot to see as they were mostly sleeping.The large aquarium was ok, but maybe not as exciting as others like Kelly Talton's in Auckland New Zealand. We enjoyed Raging River ride, The Rapids (you will get soaked), The Flash (not for the faint hearted), and my favourite Hair Raiser.The North and south Pole Encounter were mostly good.Because of illness we didn't get a full day, and didn't see any of the shows, but we felt it would be a repeat of some of what we saw at Sea World in San Diego.We would have enjoyed it more if they had employed an express or fast pass system to maximise your time. It must be over packed on the weekends or holidays.Meals and snacks were fine, but the Korean dried Squid is not for us. We had a meal at a restaurant near the Polar encounters, and it was cave like, and atmospheric, with good views of the Penguins and their habitat through a large glass wall.The Park is nicely situated on several levels of a hill, but it provides a problem for easy access. The escalators and cable cars are great but time consuming.It's noisy particularly near the \"sideshow Alley\".I was a little irked by the Halloween additions in some areas - a lovely big Aquarium, with random plastic Pumpkins in it, but all in all we enjoyed our visit here.Plenty of shops for souvenirs, and good toilets.Cable Car ride is a pleasant, quiet distraction."

Since it is Halloween month, there are Halloween decorations and \u201chaunted houses\u201d for free visits (with the day ticket purchase). However, we went for the rides first, hence missed out a lot of animal exhibits, including the pandas. We managed to catch the view of the sleeping panda though.Pros: - With the price of HKD320 per person, it is very affordable. It is like getting a package of different attractions / tickets in Singapore (e.g. Universal Studio Singapore, Halloween Horror Night, River Safari, Cable Car ride, SEA Aquarium, etc). - There are plenty of exciting rides.- Love the dolphins and penguins.- Great scenery from the top of the cable-car.Cons:- The park is too big to be covered in a day. We have reached at 11am and went back at 8pm. Yet, we have not covered a lot of the items. - Although it was a Thursday, each ride took us about an hour of queuing time.We will definitely go back to Ocean Park again, and hope by that time, the new MTR station will be operable."

It is bigger, but not better.This park tries to do 2 things, and I am not sure they go together. First it is a marine park, with aquariums, dolphin shows, and other water based educational exhibits. These are interesting and quite well done (especially the seals and walrus area). The dolphin show is well worth going to - but is really no different to other ones elsewhere in the world.Second it is a fun fare - with a number of wild rides meant for youngsters.It is spread over a large area - lots of walking - and there is a lot of up and down, although cable cars, trams and escalators help. But it becomes a tiring day.Went at a weekend in October, and there were lots of people but queues for what I wanted to go on (not the wild rides) were OK. I suspect the fun fair side would have involved a lot of waiting!As with all theme parks food and drink is poor and extremely expensive (HK$20 for water). Buy outside and take with you.The best way to get there is special bus (629) from Admiralty, leaving regularly.Worth a visit for the marine side - cheaper then Disney - but nothing like as entertaining."

They cut into queue in a large group so unless you can tell them where the queue starts from, be prepared to wait for a few more cable cars before you step into yours. As halloween is less than a month away, the park has scare actors and several scare zones and attractions. They were not scary at all. More of funny that scary. When you stepped into the attraction, polar adventure, you will see one huge polar bear figure that looks like the one from the Coca cola ad. So I was looking forward to see a polar bear. But after checking with the staff, there's no polar bear in the entire park.

Hong Kong Ocean Park has its own charm and some things that Disneyland cannot offer - hair rising rides and giant pandas!What's great:- It's a hybrid park (oceanarium, marine mammal park and amusement park) which offers variety of things to see and do- Scenic view of the park and some parts of Hong Kong- Very good animal exhibits and gigantic aquariums. Great to finally see the pandas after years of watching documentaries.- Newer additions North and South Pole offer a good, icy relief from the heat and a real Happy Feet experience - Amazing rides for the thrill-seeker- Great value, surprised that ticket price is much lower than Disneyland (I paid around Php5,000 for 3 adults)The not-so-great:- Incredibly hot and crowded. Even if you're not the umbrella-carrying type, you will need one. Bring sunscreen.- Dophins and seals show is just average, I have seen better- Long walks, the park is huge and attractions spread all over the place compared to the very compact Hong Kong Disneyland- Cable car was closed for maintenance  Ocean Park caters to a more matured group and offers a different experience. Worth a full day visit and definitely worth seeing the pandas and penguins. I recommend purchasing tickets in advance to avoid the long ticket lines in the hot sun. Very crowded even on a Monday with hordes of tourists from Mainland China."

Adventure Land (where the Mine Train, Space Wheel and Raging River) is a bit isolated. Good thing though was we did not have to queue long for rides there that the family went twice on the Mine Train.b) The Arctic Blaster ride had no protection over the weather and it was pouring while we were there queuing for about 45 mins. Queue was long as the Hair Raiser was closed for safety and the Arctic Blaster itself was only allowed to operate to 75% capacity as too wet.c) Giant Panda was fast asleep in the late afternoon but thank goodness the Red Panda was actived) Taxi queue was very long and waited for about an hour."

We decided to try out both Ocean Park and Disney HK. I'm going to post a separate review for Disney HK so I'll focus on our Ocean Park experience here.The Good: The prices were about 20% cheaper across the board than Disney HK. The Gondola ride between the two parts of the park is a great ride and on a clear day provides for some of the best arial views in Hong Kong. Truly stunning and a one of the places in Hong Kong where you can enjoy some silence!!! They also have a number of real roller coasters and other rides for grown ups which made my 15 and 17 year olds very happy...The Bad: The whole park is not designed for or caters to Westerners and you totally feel it. The entire operation seems to be geared to PRC tourist bused by the thousands. While the less expensive food was about 20% less than Disney, the service was 80% worse and the food qualty was 60% worse so not such a great deal. The more expensive dining options were as expensive if not more expensive than Disney and food quality and service were not great. None of the staff at the park seemed to be trained or particularly service oriented.We were with family friends who brought a thick Ocean Park coupon book. Don't bother. Everytime they tried to use one, the employee either claimed not to know anything about it, refused to accept it or it turned out to be a total bait and switch.To top it off, one of the newest roller coaster rides (I think it was the Hair Raiser) my kids were really looking forward to broke! The worst part was how management handled it. We were in line for about 30 minutes inching to the entry gate and things seemed to slow down. For the next 20 - 30 minutes we hardly moved at all (except when people started leaving the line). Only then did we hear someone on the speakers apologize that they were testing the roller coaster for \"safety\" and that the ride should start again soon and to please wait. The same annoying annoucement ran again and again for another 15 - 20 minutes then suddenly they change the announcement to \"sorry, ride is closed\"... What a Joke.Again, I think our disappointing experience really has more to do with expectation management and reference point (big amusement park fans in the US, Singapore and Japan - all much better!). I don't think Ocean Park could care less if folks like us ever came back as I can't image westerners represent a material percentage of their business or profits. They seem to be building and expanding like crazy and it was pretty crowded (super long lines at the McD) so the formula must be working for them!"

Ocean park is decked out in halloween decorations for the month of october, with special events happening in line with this.There are up to 5 'haunted houses' to explore, some pumpkin carving displays etc.However, the crowd is huge and the queues are crazy! we queued an hour for just one haunted house.. which only took 2 mins to walk through! however, kudos to the extreme high effort put in for the props and hiring of so many scare actors who were extremely dedicated to their roles. other rides and shows are still in operation too, but yes, you have to queue queue queue for the rides. do not miss the dolphin show though, it was awesome!"

The good things first :1) Lots of animals such as penguins, sea-lions, walruses, seals, pandas, dolphins etc which is great for people like us who only see such animals on TV otherwise ---- the sights themselves make the day in my view2) Great trolley ride --- goes over the ocean and hills --- stunning views on the way though in the morning, the wait can be a little long3) Great food options --- zillion times better than Disney's parkRoom for improvement :1) The park is very big but I thought a little dis-organized with attractions spread all over the place leading to crazy walks between 2 attractions --- Disney that way is superbly compact --- not sure anything can be done about this !!!2) The cab line while exiting in the evening is > 40 minutes because there is no MTR connectivity yet (should be there soon though) and because half the cabbies for some reason dont want to pick up people from this place -- can spoil the mood after a fun day"

It takes entire day to do justice to the theme park, not because it is huge but because the waiting time for every attraction is toooo long.The only thing you will remember after you returned from Ocean park is that you were in queue most of the time. Some tips to avoid long queues. Buy tickets from any 7-11 stores. That will save you 1 hour of waiting in front of the gate. Immediate rush to the cable car station (take left after you enter the park). The cable car ride is very beautiful. Try the boat rides (there are 2 of them) as soon as you can. Maybe 1-2 shows. That will take the entire day. Good place to spend time with family. But I personally feel the entry tickets are overpriced (HK $ 320). If you have to pick just one from ocean park and HK Disneyland, I would recommend Disney (although the cost of entry tickets for Disney, HK $ 430 per Adult) is more than that of the ocean park."

We arrived just shortly after the park opened and headed for the panda enclosure. We have pandas back home in Singapore too, but I haven't got the chance to see them, so seeing pandas in Ocean Park was quite refreshing.After that, we took the tram up to the summit and had the most amazing time of our life with the rides and visiting the various animal/ marine enclosures, then made our way back down the park with the cable car that overlook the beautiful repulse bay. The waiting time for the cable car was close to 45 mins, but it was worth it.The park has so many rides, I lost count of them. We waited no longer than 20 minutes for any ride, some rides have virtually no queue at all. Besides, the rides, the animal enclosures are really interesting and educational for my two kids. Don't miss the grand aquarium, it has the most stunning view of the stingrays, sharks and so many different kinds of marine life. I love looking at the sea lions and walrus, it was so mesmerizing watching them swim gracefully.It's October and so the park was decorated for Halloween, there is additional attraction which show case some of the most unusual pumpkin cravings that I had ever seen.For the price of one theme park, Ocean Park quite possibly offers what I could get from three different Singapore's attractions (USS, River Safari and SEA Aquarium). All in all, I felt that Ocean Park is THE BEST value theme park I had ever visited and I also prefer it over Disneyland Hong Kong. I would definitely recommend a visit if you have time in Hong Kong because you need an entire day to cover this enormous park."

We waited no longer than 20 minutes for any ride (including the main rollercoasters) and often didn't have to wait at all. The park was also decorated for Halloween. This was done really well and added to the enjoyment of our day. However, without doubt the real star attraction of the park is it's location with many of the rides affording stunning views across the South China Sea. What a setting! We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Ocean Park and would recommend a visit if you have time when in Hong Kong.Top tip: There are many options for food in the park - some of the restaurants are VERY expensive (and serve average food) while many kiosks or smaller street food options look better value for money - and taste."

Other than that, the park has expanded with alot of new rides and attractions. Old Hong Kong was very amusing and the aquarium was great. The dolphin show is not as exciting as it just to be but still ok. The recommendation is to take the train to the top of the park and start there first then work your way down. Everyone tends to hit up the panda zoo first but the best time to go see the panda is the feeding time. Find out the time for their feeding and get there 25 minutes earlier and you will have an awesome view. Cable car is hard to catch later on the day, so do this early if you can."

My fianc\u00e9 and I took the MTR which was near our hotel to the Admiralty Station, then there were buses that would take you directly to the Park. Long lines, so go early if you want to have enough time to see every attraction in the park. The Park itself was nicely done. Something like Disney would do. There is lots of construction going on at the park as they are expanding to bring more attractions in 2014, however, this will not affect your trip as the entire park is open for business. Be prepared to do TONS of walking. The park is pretty big and spread out with lots of hills in between each attraction. So, with the typical South East Asian tropical heat, wear comfortable walking shoes and bring sun block and a hat or umbrella to help you make it through the day.We did see quite a few people who had brought their own food to eat (locals). As a tourist, this is not practical so be prepared to pay the super high price of amusement park food.  If you plan to see any animal shows, show up for them at least 1 hour before the start of the show or else you may not be able to get inside as the seating fills up fast. Overall, we had a pretty good day. Enjoyed the time there and especially the roller coasters (well, I did.... my fianc\u00e9 vowed never to ride them ever again in her life! hahaha) Definitely a place to visit if you are going to be in Hong Kong."

The best ride was The Flash, also the expedition trail was worth the visit. The down point however was the long queues for each and every ride and therefore a whole day is more than necessary to explore the park.

Then followed the signs to the 629 bus. Fifteen minute bus ride and we were at Ocean Park. Arrived at 9am for a 10am opening, people already queued.Gates opened at 10 on the dot and we were in within two minutes.We decided to go straight to the Pandas so we joined the flow of people headed the same way thinking wow the Pandas are popular, well we were wrong everyone was headed to the Cable Car, no one went to the Pandas and we walked straight in.There was An An the panda sitting eating less than 5 m away from us and no one else around. He ate we watched. We stayed about 20 mins others came in but very few in numbers. How glad we were we went straight away because we went back at 2.30pm we waited 10 mins to get in only to find both Pandas out the back and you could only view them on TV screens.Had a 30 min wait to get on the cable car at around 10.30am. Well worth the wait it is a 12 minute ride to the top with spectacular views. On the way up the rain started.Rode the Rapids in Adventure Land a good raft ride and you get very wet, even if it isn't raining.Kids wanted to ride Mine Train but when we got there it was closed not sure if it was because of the rain. Went to Raging River a quick fun flume ride with no waiting so rode three times. Fun drop at the end.Another fun ride was Arctic Blast roller coaster. Queued 30 mins due to reduced loads because of rain.Went though the Grand Aquarium about a 10 min wait and moves through a very well presented aquarium allowing crowds to move through.Easy trip back, a row 629 buses queued to take the crowds back to the MRT. About 25 minute trip in the traffic.This is a great amusement park which covers a large area not good for very young or elderly. Has heaps of different rides so everyone will find something they like and it is cheaper than many other similar parks around the world. Great value.Get in early and see the Pandas if that is your thing, they were ours and were, worth the price of entry alone."

They love roller coasters and scary rides and Ocean park had it all. My family wanted to take the cable car up the hill to the next level where all the rides were I'm a afraid of heights and do not like cable cars but I did it anyways for the kids. I had thought it was just a straight short ride up omg to my surprise the cart turned to another hill and you are pretty much dangling from a wire over the ocean yikes!! Lets just say i didn't look down once and it felt like the longest ride of my life. At closing time we took the express train back down :). Ocean park is a must for families coming to Hong Kong.

Last time I went with my little cousin (8 yrs old at that time) and she was probably the only one that enjoyed it a lot. There are animals to see, but the most popular animal to see is the pandas. Most of them were sleeping when we were there though. They do have a lovely panda gift shop which was neat. The rides are basically for little kids. When my sister and I went (we were probably around 13-15), we were not impressed by the rides. We went on the (supposedly) \"tallest\" ride in Ocean Park and it was a miniature ride that would've been ridden by little kids in the US, but apparently you had to be tall in HK to ride it. So all these Cantonese people were screaming their heads off while we were on there, and my sister and I just had a not-impressed look. There are some cable cars and you get to see the view around. There are sea animals shows too. There actually weren't a lot of people there last time I went even though it was during the summer. I recommend this place to people with little children."

Its expensive, but its worth it because once you're in theres nothing else to pay except for food and drink, plus any souvenirs you may want to buy. With an emphasis on animal conservation, the Panda enclosures are a must, and don't forget the beautiful little red panda as well, cute as a button. I need to emphasise this is not a zoo, however there are some great themes here and you will see a lot of themed animals. I especially enjoyed the aquarium, and the novel way they encourage you to look at conservation.The dolphin and sea lion show, whilst aimed at the kids, also had a strong conservation message which I liked.Food was good though expensive, but why let you wait in a queue for ages, promise you a free tub of ice cream if you buy a certain order, then when you pay, make you go back into the queue again to collect your free gift. Surely a freezer at the counter would alleviate the complete chaos that ensues.The undersea train (not really) was good as my partner was not into going up the mountain on the gondolas, but there is an attitude here, even though the ground staff are really helpful and monitor the crowd sizes of each train compartment before letting you on; that you have to push, scratch and fight your way onto the train when you know you're getting on anyway. That attitude is prevalent here and i came away with several bruises.In fact dont go in a weekend, its far too crowded when hot (30 degrees the day we went) and there are areas like the train which are quite unpleasant.The rides also had huge lines but everyone was enjoying themselves once on them.Would we go back, yep I guess so, but not in the weekend. Take sensible shoes, its a big walk, and be prepared for at least 4 hours minimum to get the best from the day."

Plan ahead to get most of your experience in Ocean Park its quite big so be really prepared. Note: be prepared to walk a lot too since rides/attractions are far from each other.

Firstly i normally am a very tolerant person but This was definately the worst theme park I have visited due to the grade of customers (mainland tour buses). The queues were borderline dangerous especially for children as people were pushing very hard. If you can tolerate bad manners, unnecessary shouting and umbrellas blocking your view all the time, you might survive this zoo of a park. no need for animals stand back and watch the humans. Ocean park must be raking it in off these ignorant consumers, but if you want an enjoyable, civilized day out, this is definately not the place for you and your family."

There is a dedicated bus service to the park from the station and regular services. Even after the fireworks show.There are many animals on show such as Dolphins, Sea Lions, Seals etc but the main attraction is the Panda. They are so majestic. Roller Coasters galore. There are so many and of varying sizes. The 1 thing they all seem to do is hang in the air for a couple of seconds so you can take in the excellent scene of the islands and boats. The Dolphin and Seal show is great. Try and get in early to get a seat so you don't miss out.You will need roughly about 6 hours to fully appreciate this place. At 7pm or 7:30 on certain nights, they do a dragon show at the front fountain. It incorporates the fountain with lights, fireworks and fire. This show is brilliant and to think I was ready to skip it to go back to the hotel. It would have been the worst mistake of my life."

Do not get me wrong, the rides in Ocean Park are amazing. i recommend the Hair Raiser, The Flash, the Raging River, Ocean Park Tower and the Abyss. there are so many thrill rides for adults that a day is really not enough to enjoy them all... considering the fact that each section is really far from each other. REALLY far with hills and long, slow escalators to and from. walking from one section to another takes around 10-15 minutes if you are fast - and you have to be fast as it gets really hot in the afternoon and there is very little shade available.We enjoyed the animal shows immensely. it was nice to see how the trainers trained their animals. visiting the Pandas were also a highlight - and a welcome break from the heat as their area is airconditioned. Another break from the heat are the South Pole and North Pole enclosures where it was REALLY cold. It was nice to wander around and see the penguins, the sea lions and other animals. i really admire the conservation efforts of Ocean Park and you really get to appreciate the care they take with the animals that they care for. Make sure to catch the feeding times of the animals, it's noted in the event schedule flyer you can get when you enter the park.When we visited, the cable car was not in operation so everybody was jammed into the train going up and down the summit (where the good rides are). People were pushing and cutting lines and, generally, being disrespectful to each other. it was a real turn-off. AND it was a weekday so i cannot imaging how bad it is on weekends :( same thing was happening on some of the rides, too. so even if Ocean Park has improved their rides, their shows and their services, these factors made our visit not so enjoyable. and since we went to HK Disneyland the day before - the difference was more obvious. hopefully, my next visit won't be as bad."

This was a first trip for three of our grandchildren & our daughter-in-law and the first since childhood for our oldest son. The park continues to add meaningful and entertaining attractions that maximize the impact of its unique topography and peninsular setting. From unusual Red Pandas & an outstanding aquarium to multiple amusement rides and live entertainment, this park has it all at an exceptional value. Language is no problem for international guests and staff are personable, well trained and well informed. Transit by Dedicated Citibus route 639 from Admiralty ( take Exit B) from Admiralty MTR) plus the ability to buy park tickets adjacent to the bus boarding spot is very convenient. A great choice for a great day. Start early to beat thre crowds and plan to enjoy a full day visit."

It will be ideal if you are there even before the park opens so that you get your tickets and get in when it opens. The cable car ride is so popular the queue forms very quickly and who can we blame? The scenery is beautiful! The clear skies, the blue sea and the mountains. However, I will recommend to take the Ocean Express up to the submit as your first stop and then the cable car down to visit the other attractions. This saves you a lot of time queuing as the Ocean Express takes more people at one go and you are amongst the first to enjoy the submit with significantly less crowd. Once you are done at the submit and ready to go down, you will realize there is hardly any queue for cable car down as people are still coming up. That's when you can take the cable car down and enjoy the rest of the attractions.There are a lot of animal shows and you have to be there early to get a good seat. The best show I think is the dolphin show. Love it! The pandas and otters are my other favorites too! This place is amazing!"

Dont't go with infants or kids below 5 yrs of age. They will be tired soon and you might not even be able to cover the entire park and you wont enjoy then. Food is pretty expensive. Though there are many options available. Keep some cash handy, there is just one ATM and to locate it and use it you will have to walk a lot. Dont go on a weekend, it seems like the entire China has arrived... And in case you decide to go with infants, carry your own baby stroller.... The quality of theirstroller is really bad and theycharge $HK 75 for that... Overall a good entertainment place!"

Best part was view from cable car and restaurant at top. But if you have younger kids they'll enjoy if not too hot of a day. Definitely go early as others have suggested. And if very hot day take umbrella. It helps shelter you from heat when standing in line.

We tried to play as many rides as we could but it started raining very heavily so at last the rain reduced so we played many rides and at the end we finished 6 out of 8 land sites which is a lot! The rides are very thrilling and also have proper safety measures. The rides as well as the service is very helpful. I recommend starting with Marine World, Adventureland and Thrill Mountain first because they have the most thrilling rides ever and then you can continue with the others, we regret because we could not play in Marine World as the park was closing down. And Ocean Express is a great way to travel to the other end of the park. Ocean Park is amazing and worth everyones visit!"

From my Blog about the trip...While at dinner with my friends John and Myla in Hong Kong - they mentioned that Disney in Hong Kong was less about \"rides\" and more about the Disney characters and culture. Marty - their 14 year old son highly recommended Ocean World. He said the rides were \"awesome\" which is all that my daughter Brighid had to hear. Disney was out - Ocean World was in.We took the bus to the other side of Hong Kong island - which by itself was a thrill ride like no other. The large public bus was going 50 miles an hour down winding mountain roads like a bat out of hell. The locals were used to it - but you could tell the tourists by the white knuckles and tight grip on the bus seats throughout the large double deck bus.We arrived to the resort outside of Aberdeen after 45 minutes. It looked like a typical amusement park except for the geography. The grounds were perched on the side of a mountain with a prominent cable car strung over the top of the summit as far as the eye could see. So far - pretty cool. They certainly had my attention.There were cartoon characters of course - none of them could possibly approach the Disney level of greatness - but they were awesome for their kitschy style. I immediately thought of the movie \"Vacation\" with Chevy Chase. The visit to Wally World was one of the best parts of the movie. It was a shame that Brighid never saw the movie as I really wanted someone to validate my comparison. Where was my friend Marcy when I needed her. She would surely appreciate the reference.We arrived inside the park and made a beeline for the cable car. On the way all of the foot traffic got funneled through \"Old Time Hong Kong\" - a recreation of what things were like in the Colonial Hong Kong at the turn of the century. There were lots of places for photo opportunities and it seemed like the Chinese and Asian guests were eating it up. I could only think of the stink this would raise in the United States. The level of Political Incorrectness was off the charts. There would be a lot of Asian Americans that would be highly offended - I am sure.The cable car was a small gondola with 8 seats. It went straight up the mountain to the peak and then on over the top. The views of the island and ocean were extraordinary. I could not believe that this was so beautiful. It took a full 10 minutes on the cable car to get to the other side of the park. Most of the good rides were here - as well as the aquarium and river park.We spent most of the day riding roller coasters. While I enjoyed it thoroughly - especially with my thrill seeking teen - it was rough. New fangled roller coasters are now more about speed and G-forces that strictly about thrills. My body is feeling it this morning after a long day doing loop-de-loops. My inner ears had to be a mess. Equilibrium was affected as it felt like I had \"sea legs\" the rest of the day.The afternoon ended all to soon. It was time for the last thrill ride of the day. The 6X bus back to Central Hong Kong. The driver did not disappoint we rode up the mountainside as quickly as we rode down - to the same affect. White knuckles and amazement with the skill level of the bus driver."

We ended up mostly going to restaurants in HK Island, near Ocean Park, and also going to HK Disneyland. I really liked that Ocean Park had really good adult rides, like the roller coaster and the floom rides. It was also good that the park had live animals around (felt like a zoo with rides). Also liked that Ocean Park was relatively close to other HK Island attractions compared with HK Disneyland. I didn't like it that Ocean Park seemed a bit on the dirty and worn side, but not so much that I would dissuade anyone from going there."

Both visits include spending a day at Ocean Park. Nonetheless, both times were all great experiences. Last month though, the queues for the rides may take most of one's time (may take 40mins to 75mins wIting time) and may become frustrating with the scorching heat but my friends found a way out. The rides have a single rider queue and it really saved our time. You don't really need to talk with your friends while riding those scary and thrilling rides so we decided to just queue as a single rider so we can really save time, decide to meet at the exit before going on to the next ride, and we get to have more time exploring other rides. It is pretty useful when we only got a day to tour around a massive park. Fun, fun, fun..."

Perhaps not the absolutely greatest thrill rides in the world but the park is at the top of a hill and the view as you were on a ride with not much to see below you except the South China Sea several hundred feet down was sensational. With giant pandas, dolphins and incredible views our only regret was not allowing a full day. We arrived at 11 and had to leave at 5.30 and felt this was inadequate."

Yes... Ocean Park is best in Hong Kong compared to others for my opinion. I can say one of the bests all around world :) You can find many assorted rides, animals, scenery all in this park. This is why it is crowded and is a tourist spot as people are lining up from 9 30 am at doors, like we did :)The park is grounded on two sides of a hill and connected with a cable car ride(erected on a cliff and might be thrilling for some) and a funicular ride from the tunnel in a train where screens are installed on the ceiling to give an atmosphere like we are travelling under water. You choose which one to travel with, we went by funicular to avoid cable car queue and reach the other side quickly; came back by cable car to rest during our ride with beautiful scenery.The entrance side is mainly for animals and more childish rides with shops and restaurants. The other side is for the 'real' rides; 3 out of 4 roller coasters are extremely exciting, all classical rides in water, on rails, in air...etc.... Seals, dolphins, a big aquarium, a giant panda, gold fish room... this can take a whole day for you (if weather permits). You will definitely be exhausted so better schedule a massage for afterwards. This is a must visit in Hong Kong especially if you are a theme park/roller coaster fan."

To celebrate my son\u2019s 8th birthday, we planned a one-week Hongkong trip, which included a visit to Disneyland Park, Science Museum (see separate reviews), and Ocean Park. Our visit was in August 2012.Important: Ocean Park is so huge and the attractions are very far away from each other that you should make sure you\u2019re wearing comfortable shoes because you will do a lot of walking. We started our visit by riding the cable car up to the mountain... it was a breathtaking experience! Later that afternoon, we went back down via the train (nothing special). If you are visiting in the summer, like us, be prepared for a very,very hot day. My son runs inside gift shops and souvenir shops just to feel the airconditioning. And because you will be walking a lot, you will also need to hydrate regularly. There are many rides in Ocean Park but we didn\u2019t try any because we have motion sickness. The dolphin show was good, as well as the Jelly Fish museum, and the Goldfish treasures. We also liked visiting the pandas, the walrus, then the oceanarium. Many of the attractions have photo taking as part of the experience...but it\u2019s up to you if you will buy them as souvenirs(as photos or key chains). We bought our photos made into key chains at our cable car ride and when we visited the panda. On our first day, we also had a fantasy photo taken... making it look like we were riding on the back of a whale....this is our favorite...and the staff who took the photo was also very nice . Ocean Park is so huge that one day visit is just not enough. If you plan to visit it for more than a day, you might want to consider checking-in at L\u2019Hotel Island South (see separate review). If you purchase your Ocean Park tickets from this hotel\u2019s front desk, you get a ticket good for 2 days for the price of a one-day ticket. Also, this hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from Ocean Park, which is less than a 5-minute ride away. This proved to be a great advantage when on our second day visit, the weather was bad and it was raining with strong winds when we left the park that night. We saw a long queue for the taxi ."

This is the must visit place in Hong Kong, with the entrance fee that we paid it is worthy. There are many zones cater to different age of groups, playground and rides for young children, the Adventure Land for those who love high speed and challenging rides, leisure rides for families and senior citizens.The Park is crowded but the staff there are able to control the crown professionally and they are very polite and friendly. We are able to see different animals that we seldom see in our daily life like seals, penguins, walrus, sea lions, dolphins and of course panda. There are many animal shows and feeding time as well, so we need to manage our schedule well. My children express the Grand Aquarium is one of the best aquarium they ever visited. The park is big and crowded, we suggest the first thing is to take the Ocean Express from Waterfront Station to the Summit (hill top), visit all the sites at the Summit then only take the cable car down to a other sites. We have avoided many queues because many people are going up hill later, we can see many people queuing up for food, train and cable car while we are going down during noon time. The only cons is during Summer is very hot, all of us have sunburn. ."

Many people were on queue for long time from 60-90min per-game and it's not convenient when the peak season. I have rent a stroller for my boy but when we played a game and my son were walking with us to be on queue so i put the stroller on this parking space but when i came back the stroller was gone. I asked the man whose working near my stroller and he said he didn't where it was and not seem to care to found my stroller. So i say goodbye to my $HK 100, as is the deposit for the rent stroller. So overall i do not like this place at all and i will not suggest my friends or my family to go there because they will regret if they go there and really wasting time."

I am not sure how many people would agree to it, but this place is worth a day tour. You would be spellbound with the entire experience. The variety offered by Ocean world is outstanding. I mean you can visit underwater world, see the Panda bear, see birds carrying out stunts.The price for Adult is 280 HK. If you are cominmg through the MTR come out of Exit B and alight on Bus 260 which would be parked. These are double decker bus which continously runs to and fro from the park. You can also check for volunteers there who provide you about 40 HK discounts, thus you can purchase from there as well."

The prices of drinks and food is expensive.

Queues for the young children's rides were relatively short, except there weren't all that many. The queue for the big merry go round was surprisingly long however, as many adults (at least half) actually lined up for this ride too!! It also took a long time for them to go around and buckle everyone in for this slow ride, and once everyone was buckled, it went around for 2 whole rounds before the ride was over!! Worth the queueing up? I think not!Conversely, the cable cart was well worth the wait. The views offered (of the sea and islands) was nothing short of breathtaking. It is a must experience. If you're scared of heights, it's still a must experience!On the other side of the island, there are more thrilling rides for older children. We didn't go on any as our children were too young for the rides. Instead, we had ice cream and watched the dolphin show. The show itself was good, but nothing compared to the shown in Sea World Queensland (Australia). We felt sorry for the dolphins as the pool they spent the rest of their time in seemed remarkably small. If you love marine animals, you'll also enjoy visiting the aquarium. My children loved it, especially my son who would stare for hours if we didn't remind him there was more to see. Overall, we had a wonderful time, and it is definately worth the visit. Word of warning: When you're feeling hungry, I recommend NOT going to Neptune's restaurant. Though it offered amazing views of the main aquarian tank, do not go if you expect good food. We ordered the lobster fried rice (x2) which was less than average and the pan fried black cod which I immediately spat out before chewing. I normally love eating fish, whether it be fried, steamed or grilled. However, the black cod they served was like no fish I'd ever eaten. I don't know how to describe it other than it was not edible. All in all, we paid just under $200 (Australian) for four dishes, 3 of which were under average and one which was inedible.After we left the restaurant, we passed by some small stalls set up outside which smelt wonderfully delicious and very reasonable price :("

Anyways, we only got to go up the cable car, ate lunch there (to avoid the Mainland Chinese crowds), saw the Dolphin Show, the Pandas, and went home. I wasn't planning on riding rides, so it was no big deal. However, if I had kids or a family this place would have been literally hell on earth. The crowds were horrendous. How a theme park can operate like that is beyond me. This place needs to raise the admission fees to like $100 US per person to make it comfortable to enjoy it. Way to overcrowded."

The theme park features an underground marine park showcasing marine life, a panda enclosure and water seals which one can feed at a fee. It also has a wide choice of activities; from river rafting at high speed, an area where one can swim to cool - vital in the summer heat! - a high speed train ride, and many fun activities at the peak. It is creatively designed, so one can get to the peak using either the cable cars or the 'ocean train'. There are also many escalators all over to easily get round the various amusements and many food outlets selling a variety of food. It has a huge fountain in the middle which offers a stunning view of synchronised water jets. The cost was HKD 280 (140 for children), a very fair price considering all the attractions. There are also some educative tours targeting children, some however must be booked in advance. It can however get crowded, so get in as early as possible (opens at 10 a.m.). Also carry swim wear for a dip to cool down!"

This place has quite some history, because of Old Hong Kong, with the whole atmosphere excataly the same as HK in the 60s. The animals were great, since it was like a zoo. Certain places would be more crowded though. This is one of the two places in HK where you can ride a cable car. There are long lines for that though, also for the other rides. I also highly recommend that you take the ocean express, since it is air conditioned and faster that the cable car to get to the other part of the park. Sometimes everyone would squish you, and then you should definitely take the cable car. As maybe some of the other reviewers have said, there are long walks. There are lots of different games you can play, but the quality is not that good. The only games with good quality are those one that you pay to play. You might win a plush, or walk away losing $25-100 HKD. Take the bumper cars for instance. I waited for 30 minutes for the ride, but the game only lasted for 3 minutes and the cats were really slow. The only way you can go is when other people bump into you. The also let a lot of people in at the same time, so it was too crowded.The food though is really good, and food all around the world can be served. There is lots of different food in the restaurant above the terrace cafe. The restaurant is called the Bayview Restaurant. It used to have jellyfish in a glass window so you can eat with the jellyfish, but they disappeared. The restaurant is like a buffet style, except you pay at the end, like a school cafeteria. Another thing is that there is no proper line in some snack kiosks, and if people cut in front of you, no staff members will help you sort this out. "

We went on a Saturday, two days after visiting Hong Kong Disneyland (after the 10yo recovered!)Transport:Got there by taxi from Kowloon, came back by public transport as the wait for a taxi back was 1h, as informed by a security guard. No difficulty with public transport, Bus from Ocean Park to MTR (train) Admiralty station on Hong Kong Island, then MTR to Kowloon (or wherever). Bring small change, or get a loaded smart card for public transport.Problems:Huge crowds, as it is the summer holidays in HK and Mainland China. Lots of jostling in the lines, and the ubiquitous umbrella shielding the sun is a hazard for non-umbrella wallahs! Some of the rides had ridiculous lines: 80 minutes for a 2 min ride on the Rapids, consisting of a serene log-boat ride, then ONE drop of 10 meters or so only. Definitely not worth it.The Hair Raiser and the Runaway Mine Railway were good, and the lines shorter.Coming from Malaysia, our own Sunway Lagoon theme park has as good rides with much shorter lines!Practicalities:The whole of Ocean Park is built around a steep hill/ mountain. The entrance is near sea-level, where the aquarium, and some attractions are. To get to the others, there is a cable-car or a funicular train through a tunnel to the top (Ocean Express) that you need to take, and come back down the same way. There is fair amount of walking, with however lots of escalators between the levels. Views from the cable car and some of the rides are superb. Drinks are at the usual inflated theme park prices (water at HK$22, etc). Overall:If in HK and you want some theme park rides, with additional marine attractions (seals, sea lions, aquarium), then do go, BUT avoid the weekend, and the whole summer if possible!"

Sometimes they hide inside their little cages though if it\u2019s too hot. If you don\u2019t see them in the Panda house, there are 2 more panda in the Asian house. Exotic birds, jellyfish, penguins, seals and dolphins are some of the animals residing at the Ocean Park. The aquarium in the Ocean Park is one of the top aquariums in Asia, it is huge with lots of beautiful sea animals; big groupers, different kind of sharks, sting rays, turtles are a few of them. If you don\u2019t want to be squashed watching the beautiful see animal, there is a restaurant above the aquarium and you could enjoy your dinner comfortably whilst watching all the fishes swimming leisurely in the aquarium.Another must-see activity is the Ocean theater. There are a few shows per day where the dolphins and seals perform. They are brilliant.You could either use the cable car (highly recommend) or the train to go to the other side of the hill where all the rides are \u2013 the Abyss, Mine Coaster, Ferris Wheel etc. I haven\u2019t tried those, so cannot comment.

It was very easy to reach with the number 629 bus from Admiralty; when we arrived at the bus stop the queue was very long already (this was around 8:45am) but there were plenty of bus company staff around to direct people and lots of buses departing. Bus ride costs HK$10.6 and takes around 30 minutes.We bought our tickets from the ticket office in Admiralty MTR (near exit B) and got them for HK$150 each instead of HK$180 each.We were lucky and managed to get on the cable car up to the summit as soon as we arrived and the views were amazing over Deep Water bay. Ocean Park is built in a very unique way - the rides are on the side of the mountain and if you have the nerve to keep your eyes open you will be rewarded! The rides on The Summit are very good, we went mid-week in July and there were hardly any queues for any of the rides. We tried the Hair Raiser (very good - we went on twice!), the Mine Train (a little rickety and jolted you around) and the Dragon (this made us feel a little sick with the loops, hanging side ways and jolting!). There were also lots of other more sedate rides suitable for young kids.Pacific Pier was nice to walk through and watch the seals basking in the sun, the Ocean Theatre was excellent with the dolphin show and seals. The animal handlers seemed to really care about the dolphins and seals they were interacting with.The Jelly Spectacular was amazing! It's great to see jelly fish up close and admire their lethal beauty. The Polar Experiences were good too but very, very cold - we couldn't find the arctic fox enclosure. We got the strange funicular down to the Waterfront area (it looks like something from a Jules Verne novel) to visit the Aquarium (massive and very informative) and the Sichuan Treasures panda and golden monkey enclosure.One thing we would say it that it can be VERY loud and there is a lot of shoving, pushing and queue jumping that goes on from the huge groups of Chinese package tourists, so be prepared! We were there in a non-busy time (mid-week, July) so we would hate to see how busy it is in high season on a weekend!The incessant 'pose for photos' at the beginning of each attraction became a little annoying, but it's fine to tell the staff you don't want to stop and pose for the photos.All in all, a great day out for us adults (letting our inner kids out for the day) or families alike."

There was a tropical cyclone signal number 3 that was issued by the government the day before so we were expecting to get drenched all day. However, that day, we were blessed with perfect, sunny weather, which made our visit all the more fun. This place is jam-packed with things to do! Young and old will enjoy all that Ocean Park has to offer. We really enjoyed watching the red pandas get fed in the 'Amazing Asian Animals' area. The 'Whiskers and Friends' show (dolphins and seals) in the Ocean Theatre is also a must-see. What was great about seeing the animals and their trainers was that you can see how passionate the trainers are about what they do. They love those animals dearly. The cable car ride to the top is very scenic. Keep in mind though that this is a continuous ride to the other side of the park - about 20 minutes. If you're not one for heights, you can choose to take the Ocean Park express train, about 5 minutes. I highly recommend going by cable car as you get spectacular views of the ocean and neighboring islands. They have rides for people of all ages. We were pumped for the roller coaster rides - The Hair Raiser and the Dragon (twists and turns expected). The River Rapids was very refreshing on a scorching hot day. There's also the Ferris wheel and carousel for those who are looking for family- friendly rides. Lastly, we had to keep in mind that with every theme park or attraction that we visit, there's always some people that may ruin our stay by either cutting in line, shoving or pushing. We had to just push all of that aside and see the place as a bigger picture, the fun-filled and adventurous park that it is. I highly recommend to out this on your must-do list when in Hong Kong."

Arrived at about 9.am, after going through the Aberdeen tunnel, which again was an impressive engineering feat. We were very early as the park did not open to 10am so we picked up our tickets and waited at the front of the Q. We were first through the turnstalls, but then had to wait in another holding area before the park officially opened. We wanted to be first to get the cable cars to the top of the mountain. We were first to the cable cars, but unfortunately the winds meant the cable cars were not running so we had to double back and catch the Ocean Express. This is a train that goes through the mountain to take you to the top of the park. Again, impressive engineering and a very quick & efficient way to move a large number of people into the main part of the park.The whole park is huge and it is set in one of the most impressive natural settings of any theme park I have visited. The main rollarcoasters and some of the animal exhibits are at the top of the park so we went to these first.At the top of the mountain we went on a number of the main rides:a) Arctic Blast \u2013 a relatively tame rollarcosterb) Hell Raiser, an intensive coaster, with a number of loops, built on the side of the mountain and over looking the Seas. DW bought a picture of me on this as she thought I look terrified, which I was !c) Mine train \u2013 another traditional type of rollercoaster, but in a superb setting on the side of the mountain overlooking the sea. We went on this a couple of times.d) Ferris Wheel \u2013 traditional type of ride, in that it takes a long time to get all the people on. Probably not really worth the wait.e) The Dragon \u2013 Another rollarcoater with a couple of loops. Ok but not as intense as Hell Raiser.None of the above had any significant Q\u2019s.As the weather was wet and windy we gave the 2 water rides a miss.Whilst at the top of the mountain we also went in the following animal exhibits:a) South Pole penguin encounter. What was special about this was that you could see the penguins swimming beneath your feet.b) North Pole Encounter \u2013 saw them feeding a walrus, as well as a baby walrus and some seals.c) Chinese Sturgeon Aquarium.d) Sea Jelly Spectacular \u2013 this was very impressive, contained some huge and beautiful jelly fish. We caught the Ocean Express down the mountain and then went to the Panda Village. This was very good and DD10 loved this part. It had 2 Giant Pandas and 2 red pandas. We must have spent about 1 hour in here watching the Pandas eat. By now it was about 4pm and the cable car had opened up. I wanted to go on this, so persuaded everyone else to give it a go. I don\u2019t think anyone was that keen. Anyhow we caught the cable car back to the top of the mountain. Good and impressive views, but spoilt by the fog and the limited visibility. At the top long Q\u2019s to come down so we caught the Ocean Express back down. By now it was about 5pm and stating to rain heavily. We joined the long Q for taxis and had to wait about 35 minutes. We were back at the hotel for about 6pm."

From the grand marine life, the penguins and pandas, to the mock up of the Old HK life and the cable car, there is a lot to see. There are a lot of people on the day that we visit but the park is so big that you wouldn't really mind the crowd. Really worth the visit. We arrived late afternoon that's why we never really get the chance to see all the shows and attractions. 1 whole day is recommended when visiting. We will definitely visit again to check out those that we missed on our next HK trip! :)"

We like the aquarium the most as we found certain \"wow\" moments in there. However, the fact that most of the park was located on the hillside really dampened the fun. At one point we had to walk uphill on a long stretch of road with nothing to see on either side so it was both exhausting and boring. The exhibits and rides seemed to be randomly located and there were not enough signs to tell us where to go. The park has expanded over the years but we think that this is not equivalent to proper park design. We will not go back there next time we visit Hong Kong."

We visited with a group of roller coaster enthusiasts in July and were given a guided tour of the park and the coasters by the staff. This was great, as the park was very busy, but it did mean we missed out on seeing many of the marine attractions.To be honest the park really requires a full 2 days here...it's a large site with attractions at lower and upper levels, the upper levels are reached via cablecars (very scenic with amazing views) or the funicular railway through the mountain (which has a few surprises too and worth doing at least once...and it's also faster than the cablecars).In the heat and humidity traversing the sloping paths of the park can be hard work although there are plenty of escalators to take you up and down the various levels (there are attractions all over the place!). Our tour was quite rushed to get all the coasters in, but if you can take the park at a more gentle pace it would be more bearable.We didn't really get to see any of the marine life, so would love to go back for that, and we missed seeing the pandas too, but you cannot beat the park for thrills and amazing views. We did see the jellyfish exhibit though...highly recommended!We dined at the Bay View Restaurant and had a lovely meal - and the views from the restaurant were simply to 'dine for'...spectacular to be honest. The restaurant can get busy though and when we left after the meal the waiting area to go in was so packed it was a challenge to squeeze past all the people to visit the toilets...I expect you can book a table in advance, but not sure.The roller coasters are a nice mix of gentle and more extreme rides and the views hanging upside down on the Hair Raiser coaster are simply breath-taking. The log flume is VERY WET (lots of water jets / sprinklers) so ideal on a hot day but prepare for a soaking! The iconic ride of the park is the Dragon coaster, which looks lovely and is painted a rainbow of colours but is a little rough through the loops...but again the views from it are spectacular.It's a place we will have to return to and spend a more leisurely two days...one day was fine as a taster but having got a taste for it we will definitely need to come back...well worth a visit, despite the crowds."

Being hometown resident we would normally skip typical touristic spots, for they are usually crowded, we have been there so many times and we know of other good places with less people.We went to Ocean Park in late Jun 2013 in order to make use of the complimentary tickets from a customer before expiry. It turned out to be a fantastic day. We had little expectation from the beginning as weather was not stable, and were prepared to get rain. The weather ended up helping a lot... the park was less crowded than usual because of the grey sky and we had little waiting time for most of the games. Less people also means less heat in the queues. We had to praise Ocean Park for revamping a lot since our last visit like 5 or 6 yearts ago. There had been major renovations and new paths paves, new stalls set up, new washrooms built, new covers for queues to sheild off rain or sunshine ... Our kids are a bit bigger at 8 and 11 already so we concentrated on the more exciting rides and roller coasters ... there are many thrilling rides which even adults would have second thought before going ... one is lliterally thrown around 1080C in mid-air and you don't know which side is up. We skipped a lot of the shows (e.g. dolphin & seal show, bird show, etc), aquariums (sharks, jelly fish, etc.), small kid area (as we have seen them millions of times when we still had the annual pass years ago). Only 2 we visited were the penguin house (which was new to us) and panda house (which we did not visit so often). We left after 4-5 hrs in the park. One needs to budget a full day here to try out all the rides, exhibitions, shows, game booths, etc.We went up the mountain using the new train which is much faster than traditional cable car. There is no view but one saves at least half an hour for the queue and extra walking. The train itself is also much faster. Nice video is played on the ceiling of the train all along so it is a nice experience. When going downhill we opted for the traditional cable car to enjoy full view of the park overlooking the shoreline.Parking lot has been revamped also to be a covered carpark. So we didn't have to suffer the heat accummulated inside the car when we got back into the car at the end of the day."

Its located on the South Side of HK Island, reachable by public buses and minibuses (get these from the bus terminal below Exchange Square in Central) or a 15-20 mins cab ride from Central (around HKD 70-80).

In addition, visitors may take a ride of cable car uphill and ocean express downhill. It is a place full of fun and joy but very crowded no matter what time of the day, what day of the year. Be prepared to spare time for queuing. Anyway, it is an ideal amusement park."

Add in the Panda, Dolphins Show and Seal feeding its worth visiting just for these things alone. The park is Super Huge and Spread Out, it will take your whole day. You will have to travel by Cable Car or a Metro from one end to another which is divided by mountain. Both rides are awesome and you don't feel like its a waste of time. You will get amazing views to look at from the mountain top and the cable car.The rides look awesome and terrifying but are Not So. I got shivers looking at them but the actual ride were not that thrilling. May be they don't give the extra push as i saw kids being allowed on most of them.The lines for the rides are extremely long with waiting time of 30 minutes but after 6 pm you can get a ride within 5 minutes. Felt most of the rides were understaffed , with just 1-3 people managing a attraction. The Food and Drinks are expensive but still cheaper then Disney Land and the entry tickets are half priced(220 HK$). Get the tickets from travel agents at Admiralty Bus Pickup.I actually enjoyed the Marin- Animal Exhibits more then the Ride's."

Long line to purchase the ticket at the entrance (this was at about 10:00 AM) You can buy tickets online but we didn't since we didn't have a printer while traveling.The best parts of the lower level were the pandas, the aquarium, and the Sea Lion show. The bird show was fun but short, and was very hot with the sun overhead. We stopped by the pandas multiple times because the first time they were both almost out of sight sleeping, but later were very active.The train to the upper level had less of a wait than the cable car, but was pretty packed, so its kind of a toss up as to which would have been better.The \"rain forest\" raft ride on the upper level was a great way to cool off, but plan on getting very wet - if the ride doesn't do it by itself, there are water cannons overlooking the ride that guests can use to spray you. Upper level had more rides than the lower level - nothing extreme like a Six Flags, more like at a Disney park. The combined dolphin / sea lion show was pretty good. The North and South Pole areas were another great way to cool off in the afternoon, as well as see penguins, seals, and walrus.We ate at one of the restaurants on the upper level - nothing spectacular, but not as overpriced as at a U.S. theme park, and it had a great view. Hong Kong lines up a ton of city buses outside Ocean Park around closing time, so no issues getting back. Be aware that the return buses at closing don't go back to the central station - they drop everyone off at Admiralty station, so have a plan to get back to your hotel, etc form there. All in all a must with kids but don't discount it if you are just traveling with adults. We had a great day there."

On entering, we saw a bright, attractive, busy centre and, as the Aquarium was immediately in sight, our first impressions were that it would be mainly an educational experience. We soon realised that it\u2019s equally a place for rides.Apart from the Aquarium, where there was a clear message about conservation and protection of wildlife, the educational attractions we visited were the South Pole, the North Pole, the Panda Exhibit, and Old Hong Kong. I\u2019m not sure how much young people gain from exhibits such as these; most seemed to be running from one window or viewpoint to the next without reading the labels and signs (or having someone explain them). We missed the bird show and the seals performing on stage, but just as well, as I\u2019m not a fan of performing animals. We appreciated the Ocean Express \u2013 a train disguised as a submarine - which offers an alternative to the chair lift for moving between the two main park levels. Very clever! Although we didn\u2019t use the chair lift, I can see that it would offer splendid views of the Park and surrounding areas. It would be worth the ride to put parts of Hong Kong Island into perspective.On the very hot Friday we were there, we had no trouble with long queues for what we wanted to see. It was impossible to buy a cup of tea or coffee for a reasonable price. The caf\u00e9 at the entrance was offering one cup of tea \u2013 I assume it was made with a tea bag \u2013 for about AUS$6! Sorry! No sale!The system of buses at the exit is very well organised. Huge crowds were dealt with quickly and we were on our way with little waiting.In summary: There\u2019s something to please everyone. You\u2019ll find zoo-type attractions (fish and aquatic animals, mammals, birds); performing animals (just like a circus); rides galore; and Old Hong Kong, an outdoor museum exhibit."

The queues are too long, the people are pushy and rude and the staff have a hard job managing the volume of people.Many of the staff also didn't help lines to move fast either - the guys at the bumper cars worked so slow we thought they were just trying to annoy us all!. We gave up on a number of rides as the kids were being pushed by other people due to the over crowding. Management should reduce the number of people allowed in - even if it meant putting up the price.We also thought the shows were very poor and not up to the standard we expected. Most of it had limited or no English (or English you couldn't understand!)We would not consider going again - which is a shame as I think the park has so much potential... Now too many people and a victim of its own success??On the positive side, the food at Terrace Cafe was good (although not cheap) and the bus transport from the Admiralty MTR to the park was easy."

Cable car is a sure 12 to 15 min ride beside ocean and gives a very nice view of the ocean and the mountain. The park is split between two halves and the attractions are also split almost equally. D get a map and show timings to plan what to do and be where at what time. There is a nice chain of restaurants at the mountain side where u can eat what ever u want. The rides, free fall tower, panaromic view tower are good and highly recommended. A must if you are in Hong Kong."

They have to keep away those cheap mainland chinese tours and high cost of maintenance. We went to the park yesterday with 2 young children. We experienced at least 4 mainland chinese families tried to cut in line in front of us. Either waiting in line for rides or just waiting for the train to open the door. They would dragged their kids to cut in front of people. They have no shame at all. Even my 7 years old asked me what's wrong with those people. Another case, there was this mother let her son pee on a very busy path. There are bathrooms everywhere in the park and no lines at all. We actually felt sorry for the little boy at that time.

            "review": "Not good for smaller kids. We visited here last week with our 2 children 7 and 4. This place would be fantastic if you had older kids or were visiting as adults however for young children they were very very limited in what they could do. They did not meet the height requirements on almost every ride which was disappointing and frustrating to them. There were a few rides which we were confused as to why they couldn't go on. The park is very spread out so it takes time to travel from each world to the next making it impossible to see everything. With the lines on each ride and the time it takes to get around you will definitely need a whole day. We ate at the bay view cafe which was terrible. The food was expensive and horrible, cold and was as if the food had been sitting for days and recooked several times. Even the chips were so over cooked that there was no potato left inside - don't eat here - yuk! The buses at the end of the night were amazingly organised. After the lighting display and the close of the park there were buses lined up and it was no trouble getting out of there. So overall, don't bother with small kids - its just not worth it however for adults and older kids I'm sure this would be a massive hit. There is no shortage of rides and things to do providing you meet the height requirements."

The park was not too crowded so the waiting times were never over 30min, except the log ride, where we queued for almost an hour. The rides were great. As a family we rated the Hair Raiser, Flash, the Dragon and the Mine Train the best. For kids note the height restrictions to avoid disappointment. The Hair Raiser is 140mm. If you are tight on time maybe give the Raging River and Bumper Blaster a miss. The Polar Adventure superb. Loved the Dolphins. Unfortunately ran out of time and didnt make it to the Pandas this time. The park has improved a lot since we visited a few years ago."

The animals were great, since it was like a zoo. Certain places would be more crowded though. This is one of the two places in HK where you can ride a cable car. There are long lines for that though, also for the other rides. I also highly recommend that you take the ocean express, since it is air conditioned and faster that the cable car to get to the other part of the park. As maybe some of the other reviewers have said, there are long walks. There are lots of different games you can play, but the quality is not that good. Take the bumper cars for instance. I waited for 30 minutes for the ride, but the game only lasted for 3 minutes and the cats were really slow. The only way you can go is when other people bump into you. The also let a lot of people in at the same time, so it was too crowded. The are quality good games, and those are the games where you need to pay to play. You might win a plush, or walk away losing $25-50 HKD. The food though is really good, and food all around the world can be served. There is lots of different food in the restaurant above the terrace cafe. The restaurant is called the Bayview Restaurant. It used to have jellyfish in a glass window so you can eat with the jellyfish, but they disappeared. The restaurant is like a buffet style, except you pay at the end, like a school cafeteria. Ocean park is rich with history, and it already opened for more than 30 years. I like it because of its fun games like the chair swing. I would rate it 8/10"

You need to make sure you get there as soon as it opens and plan to stay until it closes. There is plenty to do and see with a number of great shows and attractions. I love rides but didn't even have time to do any rides by the time we went to all the different parts of the park and watched a few of the shows. I suggest you plan your day well in advance, check on the internet for the times of the various shows and have a look at the layout of the park and plan you day around the shows, looking at the exhibits in between the shows. Great staff, great shows, and great exhibits."

Only downside i can think of, was that it was extremely busy, and i visited the park on a Thursday in the heat of a Hong Kong Summer. Cable car ride, was gorgeous with great views over the park itself and the ocean and outlying islands. Excellent rollercoasters, especially the Hair Raiser. Blisteringly quick! Animal exhibits were ok, but the polar one with the seals and walruses was good, and nice and cool to get out of the heat! A good day out with fun in the sun."

The rides are fantastic and there's a lot if them. Animals and shows are great . If there is a cue at the cable cars to go up the mountain, I suggest taking the train to the top of the mountain and riding the empty cable cars down, then take the train back up - it saves you waiting in ques. Take a change of clothes so that you can enjoy Neon Splash- water gun fight attraction- in the afternoon. It cools you down and is a lot of fun for all ages.

Skip the cable cars and travel up via the train, the wait for the cars was 45 minutes and 5 for the train. You can always take the cable car back down. There was no queue when we left. We travelled with a 20 and 17 year old, they went on all the roller coasters and \" wet\" rides. The maximum wait was 20 minutes. Better than Disneyland, where waits can be up to an hour per ride. Suggestions.....pack sunscreen, water, comfy shoes (you walk miles) and a small towel. In july we sweated, it was so......hot!. Drinks aren't too dear but the food is only ok (like most theme parks) After riding on most of the rides we headed back to the lower section, by this time we were hot and exhausted as we're the Pandas, who we couldn't view, as they were asleep near their pens :( , don't blame them. We only viewed a small portion of the lower section but had a wonderful day. This is a better park to visit with teenagers than Disneyland."

There's also a very well maintained arctic center where one can see the walrus, sea lions, etc. There's also a Panda section and well, a lot to see. What's appalling is that 99% of the tourists are not able to follow instructions. They use their camera flashes when signs explicitly say \"NO FLASHES\", and they bang on the glass scaring the fish just to see them move. They can't queue up. And they yell at anyone who's in their way. So, my animal experience was great. But the people around made it very unbearable. I'm not perfect, but I think we all can try to be a bit more civilised."

So if you would like to get wet, bring a change of clothes with you.We didn't, but my daughter still joined the water fun. The day was hot and humid when we went, so even though she was wet after a water gun fun time, she didn't feel cold. She just stayed in her wet clothes for the rest of the time that we were in the park.I went with 2 teen girls, they both have been to the park many times. Their main goal this visit was the rides. So we went there right after we enter the park. Park open at 10, and we were at the rides around 10:15.They did Rev Rooster first and the line was only 15 minutes. After that they rode the Hair raiser, and that line was 20 min. After they were done with Hair Raiser, the new line was 45 min.So, if you want rides, get their early and do those first.Near the Hair raiser roller coaster, there is North pole and South Pole exhibit, and there is a Snow Fox show room.Most people know about the dolphine show, but there are also otter show-- we usually see the 2:15 show, and sea lion show.When we were there, there was a dancing show near the Panda show room.Ocean Park seems to have something new every year that we visit there.Food and drink in the park are quite expensive."

But my only problem with Ocean park was that I went on a public holiday and it was soo crowded thst I hardly did 5-6 rides and I was a single rider. The average waiting time for each attraction was 45 mins which was a killer. And I think there is a scope for bettet crowd management since they were sendind the cable cars etcwith just single people or couples which could otherwise accomodate 4-5 ppl.

            "review": "Ocean Park is GREAT!. To get there, take an MTR to Admiralty MTR station and follow the signs that lead you to the bus heading to ocean park. The bus is very frequent and there are MANY buses to and from there. No worries about long queues/wait for the bus. What you must note that the bus journey is quite a distance and you should secure a seat. Its a fixed price of HKD10.60 one way, and payable by Octopus card.Contrary to many advice given that you should buy your Ocean Park tickets at the MTR station, I did not find any travel agent selling except the official booth by them selling tickets at the standard price and the queue was long. It is suggested that you buy the tickets from your hotel and sometimes they sell it at a cheaper price (Probably cause they bought in bulk earlier before the price rose) and you avoid the queue at the bus interchange and at the entrance.I went there on a Thursday and reached there some time after the opening. Although I was there later than the opening time, the queue for the cable car was considered short and quick, I waited only about 20-30minutes. I headed straight for the cable car to go to the summit. This is suggested as the summit was less crowded. If you're a thrill seeker you should quickly head to all the thrilling rides as they are usually empty and you get to ride immediately. If not, you can cover the area at your own pace, it isnt very very crowded that you have to wait hours for a ride.The longest waiting time I had was for the cable car, the arctic blast and probably whirly bird. Non-thrilling rides tend to be more crowded.You should cover the summit before 1-2pm because that is when the mainland tour groups start arriving and the summit gets VERY VERY crowded. I would say the rides are sparesly located and alot of walking is required. Especially on the summit at where the mine trains are. It is an isolated section by itself, so ride till you're satisfied and be done and don't go back. Cause its a LONG walk there :xI must say, Ocean Park has better rides than Disneyland (Never been to the HK one but from the looks of the website, there arent many rides) and it doubles as a zoo/aquarium! Its like getting the best of both worlds.Unlike what other people, who usually leave at around 4pm, I finished at 6pm after taking most rides and seeing most exhibits.Overall, the whole park is done up very nicely and looks very new and colourful!"

Sort of.The down side - very unhappy looking Pandas - I don't know how much they were enjoying their captivity. I always feel that way when animals are in enclosures though. Strangely, I am much less concerned for marine creatures and LOVED the aquarium. The octopus and I had a love affair through the glass, the jellyfish were like disco balls and the sharks were hammer heads which always look great sailing by above you.Every exhibit had interesting facts displayed about them and the focus was very much on conservation.The dolphin show was actually very good as those things go - amid all the somersaults and acrobatics there was a genuinely moving story again focusing on the importance of taking care of marine animals.And in order to get from the aquarium level of the park UP, UP, UP to where the dolphins are (as well as the rides and the view) you can catch a cable car or a train. TAKE THE TRAIN!No offence to the cable car - I'm sure the view is amazing - but the train is full Jules Verne style adventure! We got attacked by a giant squid and saw a volcano erupt. It's low tech video effects projected on the roof of the train cars but the train itself is exactly what you would imagine The Nautilus was like and little kids loved it. Very cool (in a nerdy way)."

I would recommend getting there for opening time (10am) to make the most of the park. At the start of the day the queue for the cable car will be quite long so I recommend taking the Ocean Park express which is opposite the cable cars, this is a short metro like ride up the mountain to the top and has a large capacity. The ride features a little show inside with screens showing different types of fish and so on.At the top of the mountain there is plenty to do including the roller coasters, rides and various aquariums. The jellyfish aquarium is really good and one not to be missed. The Sea Dreams show was also great fun although it gets very full quick, so arrive around 30 minutes before the show. The north and south pole exhibits were also a highlight, although very cold inside, be prepared!At the bottom of the mountain (I took the cable car down around 3pm and the queue was only 15 minutes) you can visit the two giant panda exhibits, they were active whilst I was there which was good! There is also a sea lion show down there as well as the Grand Aquarium which is definitely worth visiting, the main tank is quite a sight. There is also a big range of rides that little children can ride in this area.The best way to get to the park is to get to the Admiralty MTR station and then you can buy your park ticket and bus ticket together. You want to go to exit B, although it is well sign posted in the station. The buses run back and forth all day and not to 4pm as their website says. They are also building a MTR station right outside the park but I think it will be a while until it is complete."

Bring or buy lots of water and/or beveragesfrom the bus terminal (@Admiral Stn) before entering.Old Hong Kong Street food kiosk are decent, its tasty despite the prices. The rides are met with snaking queues and a no-go standing under the sun doing so esp. with kids.The north/south pole exhibits are in my view very well displayed. The timings for shows and feeding/ trainer talks for both waterfront & summit are very tight. Do plan your itineary before going esp. with small kids. Whisker theatre shows meant for kids is definitely not worth the time. Was met with quite a disastrous display for the bird shows with most birds not responding according to the scripts!!! *yawn*.However, with shortage of manpower (too obvious) one can't complain too much for the entrance fee. A good 6-7hrs with kids. Symbio at end of the day is a thumbs up from me."

This theme park has been a favourite of mine as I've grown up in Hong Kong.The theme park is cheaper to enter than HK Disneyland, but it's not as action packed or new.The park has been updated and expanded over the years, but some rides need a little touch up to give it that 'zing' it had years ago. However saying this, this attraction is not boring.You'll find it to be one of the few theme parks out there that is built on a cliff. This provides excellent views on some crazy roller coasters. Recommended to go for the scenery and the surprisingly large number of attractions to enjoy."

I stayed for 7 hours and didn't see everything , if you have time this park is a must .the Dolphin show was great and it gavel time to sit as the park is large but there's plenty of signs to help you . Food and drink is a little more but that goes for all these parks where ever you are"

It seemed to be more like an attempt to copy the bird show from the Singapore bird parkand to copy the dolphin and seal shows from sea world. The aquarium though highly ranked did not live up to even one thirds of what Singapore offers at underwater world, Sentosa. The ocean park, I realized only caters to those who speak Chinese. Those who have seen sea world or have travelled to Singapore will miss nothing if they skip this attraction. Given a choice to anyone who has to pick a holiday destination in Asia, please keep Ocean park, Hong Kong as the last one. If you miss it, you have nothing to loose."

This is the first time I go to the Ocean Park despite it is the fourth visit to Hong Kong and I loved it!I have been to theme parks in other parts of the world and this park definitely is of very good standards. Even beating some established theme parks that I had been to. The entrance fee is about hkd 280 for adult and hkd140 for children age between 3 to 11. We reached the park pretty late at about 4.30pm and the park closes at 8pm. Even with the limited time we have to explore the park, we felt every dollar is well worth it!The first interest we visited is the Aquarium and I was impressed by the grandeur of it and the good variety of fishes on display. Just sitting and watching the fishes swim by is already worth every dollar I paid. The aquarium has a huge number of stingrays in it. Enjoyable to watch them swim by.Other fishes, there is also pandas that you can see in the part and some other. Interesting mammals. Penguins are there too but it can be pretty cold in the area where you get to see the penguins. We took a tram over to the other side of the mountain to see the other park and was surprised by the tram ride. The tram looks like a submarine and the whole area is so well designed that you really feel like you are under water.The other side of the park is magnificent! It shouts fun, fun, fun. The parks I full of rides, not for the weak hearted. There are also game stations and I felt I am in the middle of a carnival. There are also scenic part of the park where you can get a view of Repulse Bay. Very beautiful especially when the sun is setting. Had wanted to take the Ferris wheel but due to lack of time, we took the other ride which brings you all the way to a very high point and gives you a 360 degree view of the whole park. It was awesome.Before the park closes, the was a show at the fountain area which uses a combination of water, lights and fireworks. It is awesome.Getting to the park is not difficult. You can take a bus from Admiralty MTR. Ride is hkd10 per pax and the ride to the park is about 15 mins. Going back from the park is the same way. At first, I thought with so many people leaving the park at the same time, I may have to wait for at least an hour for the bus. But I was wrong. The park is very efficient in taking care of this. There are enough park employees to direct traffic to the buses. Within 15mins, we are already on the bus and the buses are very comfortable. The coordination in this aspect is really world class. Had an enjoyable half day in the park. I would definitely visit the park again. The next time I will give it a full day."

It is divided in two with the Aquarium part and younger children's area at the base, and the bulk of the rides a SKYTRAM ride away. The skytram goes along the side of a huge cliff and was one of the best parts of the park. There are some really fun rollercoaster rides along the edge of the cliff and a gorgeous view. This is far more teen and adult friendly than Disney HK - Which wouldn't be much fun if you didn't have kids with you because it is a fraction of the US version...and caters more to the family friendly vibe. When we went - There was hardly any lines... we rarely waited more than 5 Minutes."

Not many shortcuts like Disneyland to other parts of the park, therefore, not very convenient when traveling with elders or young children. Park tries to have performances throughout the park, but shows were not very entertaining. Be prepared to walk down slope and back up when heading to the adult attractions. I still prefer Disneyland even though smaller. However, ocean park is still a good place to add to your itinerary."

What I liked is the fact that not only did it have a fantastic aquarium and also interesting animals such as pandas (our first time to see live so was a treat) it also had rides too so it was a good mix of educational and also fun. It also had a good dolphin show. At night they have a really good water/light/fire show. Again I was impressed. And all this done against a beautiful backdrop of HK. All in all worth doing."

We were eight of us reached here at Admiralty by MTR, then a bus ride to Ocean Park, very comfortable journey.BUY TICKET AT ADMIRALTY STATION FOR HK$250, AT PARK THEY ARE FOR HK$280 WITH LONG Q! The park is very well maintained & most of the rides are working fine. The aquarium is too good, but as mentioned people didn't care not to use flash while taking the pictures, i would like to request \"kindly follow the rules\". The rides are fantastic, little bit extra waiting is there at very popular rides, approx 20 to 30 minutes, it is part of the game so lets not crib about that! at other rides the waiting is just 5 to 15 minutes. There are restrooms at regular intervals, but the provision for drinking water is poor! as HK is hot most of the time they (organizers) should take care of this basic necessity. When it comes to food it is very difficult for vegetarians, better carry your own stuff. The longest waiting time is for the cable car, to save time we took the train to go up but to come down we didn't want to let go of the amazing ride, so had to wait for 60 minutes!!! it was somehow worth it.The ten minutes light,fire & sound show is excellent way to end the day at park which starts at 7:30pm sharp.Over all a nice day at Ocean Park!!"

The Grand Aquarium is still there but it has moved to the lower park, and not as impressive as it used to be. They used to have quite a lot of fishes and many different types and sizes too and a multi-level aquarium where you can walk on the outer circumference to enjoy it at different depths. Now the old area has been converted into the home for multiply exhibits of penguins, seals, etc.The panda exhibit is still quite good although they only have a pair of black and white pandas here plus a pair of red ones.If you like thrill rides, then Ocean Park still continues to add attractions every few years. This time it was the Hair Raiser, a multi-loop roller coaster. As an avid fan of roller coasters, I had to try this one. It's different and new, although because of its continuous loops at a pretty similar speed, the element of surprise is missing. Other popular coasters have these gaps of slowing then surprising you with a sudden boost of speed or sudden drops. However, for the average rider, it will be a good ride ;-)"

The aquarium was just amazing never see so many stingrays and hammerhead sharks and heaps of other fish and it was really great with all the different aspects and viewing areas, kids would just be in awe of it all. Got to see the Red Pandas on display soooo cute and the Giant Panda which was really what I Wanted to see just gorgeous. Took the train up the mountain and the fantastic cable ride back down. Heaps of clean loos everywhere. Some of the areas are under refurbishment but there is still so much to see and do that it really didn't matter. It was really humid today but there are plenty of places air conditioned to cool you down again. There was a bit of queuing but it just is what it is, the longest queue was for the cable car to go back down the mountain. All in all we would thoroughly recommend you get there early and spend the day there it was just fantastic."

The cable car ride was memorable with stunning view of the south side of HK island. The only problem I have is that there were 2 restaurants on the lower portion of the park and one was closed for preparation of a private event. The lines at the other restaurants were longer than the rides. What kind of management decision is that to close one of 2 restaurants during a busy public holiday weekend (6/1 is Children's Day in China)? Very inconsiderate & probably money losing one."

The shows such as seal and dolphins were done only in native language and so left foreigners who do not understand the language a little bewildered.What I loved best was the BBQ Squid and the cable car ride although I didn't feel 100% safe with small kids knowing that they could possibly slide through the gaping grills of the car. Bathrooms seems scarce and the environment does not seem to be wheelchair or handicapped friendly.Overall, just an okay experience unless the standard to match was Disneyland which we visited the day before..hahahahaBut with the entrance fee and the hassle of getting there....I guess you can do given you keep an open mind to visiting it."

When you go to Hong Kong it's a must visit, as it's fairly cheap but can get a bit overcrowded.

We had the privilege of watching the giant panda eating bamboo and it was amazing.

At the North Pole Encounter, we saw spotted seals, sea lions, a huge walrus and an artic fox den with a few artic foxes.

We as a middle aged couple (50's) went to Ocean Park on a Monday in May and were surprised how quiet it was, no queues to get in and only a 15 minute wait to get on the cable car over to the other side, which was the highlight of the day cause Hong kong had turned it on weather wise, the harbour looked spectacular. We went on nearly every ride, except the roller coasters, and covered nearly every square inch of the park in 4 1/2 hours as there was almost no wait for any ride or exhibit. We thought the park was great value entry wise and food wasn't that expensive either compared to theme parks in Australia. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and would highly recommend it to anyone ,although, I can't imagine what it's like on a weekend in high season."

We were the only ones watching them have their breakfast and were able to take some great photos!The cable cars weren't running for the morning due to high winds. There weren't many queues, and if there was one, it was a relatively short wait.We caught a taxi to Ocean Park with no hassles, but had to wait in a queue for about 45 minutes to catch one back to the hotel - the bus would have been a much better option!"

The giant pandas and the lively red pandas are not to be missed; we just couldn't see enough of them. Judged purely as a zoo, however, I would have to say it's not as comprehensive or as interactive as some, particularly Steve Irwin's Australia Zoo, in Beerwah, Queensland. However, Ocean Park is also a really good amusement park, with lots of rides that kids and teens will love, and a cable car ride that gives great views of the islands. Easy to reach by bus, and an all round great day out."

When we got to the park we ignored the attractions on the ground level and headed straight for the cable car to the top of the mountain and had an absolute ball. We didn't have to queue for any of the rides and were able to take our time enjoying our thrills.After we had finished on all the rides we headed back down, much better plan to do the rides first as there was now a 20 minute wait for people to come up the cable car and the rides were beginning to queue (a board displays the average wait times).Once back down the bottom we found somewhere for lunch (near the pandas) that had a good range and was nice and clean then a quick look around some of the exhibits and then back on the bus after having spent a fun few hours.Lot's to do to keep the kiddies amused and plenty for the adult child at hearts."

They've also expanded recently, adding a bunch of new roller coasters that I haven't yet tried all of them (the last time I went, they had completed three new rides, but several were still being worked on). The rides in general are really good, and have an age range from about 3 to however old you can be, whatever tickles your fancy. But of course, little kids always want to ride the big rollarcoasters, though there is a high minimum on those.Though not as polished as HK Disneyland, OP is just massive and has a huge range of attractions, from rides to shows, to animals/the aquarium.Definitely go to the aquarium. Though some think it's boring, it still strikes me every time because it's just gorgeous and massive. The sharks are always coo, as are the stingrays. They've got dolphins and orcas somewhere else in the park. Pandas, foxes, etc are somewhere else, too. But take advantage of the zoo aspect of OP.Cable Cars are always cool.You can make them rock if you want to, and I've never heard of the cars falling. Convenient way to travel to the other side as well. (it's a pretty long walk)"

Lots of people, but the Hong Kong public transport is second to none, and coped admirably. After exchanging my voucher for a ticket I was in. There were queues, but the whole process took barely 5 minutes. Once inside, I was a bit over awed by the Ocean Park map, but the set-up of the place allowed you to go through the whole park without back-tracking, seeing animal exhibits, shows, and keeper talks on the way. Huge array of food available, from snacks to full on restaurant meals, all reasonably priced. There are toilets everywhere, with hand disinfectant, and even smoking areas for those of us that need them :) I spent the whole day there and enjoyed every minute. The only time I had to queue for longer than 15 minutes, was for the cable car. An equally easy bus trip back to North Point ended my day on a high note. If you're in Hong Kong you definitely should spend a day at Ocean Park. I had an excellent day, and I'm a solo female traveler in my mid forties!!!"

This park caters for all ages whereas Disneyland Hong Kong at this stage is purely for the under 12's (A work in progress though). Ocean Park has been there for many years and has been a mainstay of Hong Kongs entertainment scene for decades. The attractions are varied from Pandas, to merry go rounds for the tots to terror type rides for the teens. As an ocean park theme there are wonderful exhibitions of marine life. Most fasccinating of all is the jellyfish exhibition. They are all there the seals, the sharks and much much more. This is a place for all ages. You need a full day to take it all in. I flew to Beijing particularly to see Pandas in the zoo (terrible display. Dark, dingy & unkept) then came to Hong Kong and there in Ocean Park is the most wonderful display available. It's worth the entrance fee alone to see the pandas. It is more fun to go with a family group because you can vary the fun according to the age groups. Close to the entrance it is all for the under 12's and at the top of the mountain (via chairlift) it is a teenage riot of thrill rides. Hong Kong has done itself proud with this park and it caters for a variety of themes (Halloween, Christmas etc) and it brings in the locals en masse as well as the tourists. Not exactly cheap but excellent value all round. It compares with Disneyland on price but I think if you have a wide range of age in your group Ocean Park is the better option. The views from the chairlift ride are spectacular and it is hard to believe that such a large tract of land in such an overpopulated city has been made available. Magnificent views out over Lamma Island and the cargo ships moored at sea make for one wonderful panoramic view of the back of the island. One of the great theme parks of the world. Highly recommended!"

Most of the visitors are from mainland and they go by the herd mentality and thus can easily fill up the lines for various attractions.The good part me & my wife liked are the giant pandas, penguins, sea lions & walrus for which they have created artificial habitat. Another good theme we liked is the water ride but you need to have raincoat or plastic cover with you as otherwise you can get wet.

Only down side to the arcade areas are the more moronically stupid people working the other games that were not busy, who consistently kept ringing they're stupid bells to attract and customers when in fact all there were doing was driving everybody away from the arcade!!!!Be aware that if you are at the far end of the park, that it is at the lowest level of the land, so after a long day it is a bit of a tough walk back up the hill back to the cable car, so be ready as there are no escalators, it's all walking...Would highly recommend Ocean Park to anyone with kids, or overseas visitors, but if you are visiting from overseas, please don't do what the mainland Chinese do and sleep all over the place, it just looks so uncivilised."

Please don't miss the cable car ride to the attractions at the top. One of the highlights was the North and South Pole pavilions behind the Arctic Express roller coaster. Really well done. The seals/walrus' and the penguins were so cute. Rides were all excellent too. Something for everyoneThe Aquarium is also a must see.We went on a weekday so there were no crowds at all and barely had to line up for anything.All in all, a great day out and can highly recommend it. It's easily accessible by public buses too. Make sure you have he correct change if paying by cash or even better, have an Octopus card if your in HK a few days. Public transport is the way to go"

With only the symbio and panda stuff in the main entrance area.Being too big do expect to walk a lot and in the months of april may dont forget an umbrella. You will get long waiting times for most things but mostly its worth the wait and most of them dont exceed 45 min.Dont forget the hair raiser.its their best ride.If you have one day free in hongkong then this a welcoming refreshing dayout esp with kids and family."

So this park has it all - beautiful views across the China Sea and out towards the islands, forest all around, fantastic mix of rides and the chance to observe some wonderful animals. There is a huge amount to see and experience: we (5 adults and an 8 year old) were there for a 5 hr day, but we could easily have gone back to see more or do it at a more leisurely pace. We went on a week day and got there at opening time. We had virtually no queues for any of the rides which was pretty unbelievable! Us adults got to scream and see the landscape upside down from a mix of rollercoasters, or freefalling from another attraction. If you can keep your eyes open, the views are spectacular. 8 year old loved all the water rides and galleon ship. Penguins, seals, seeing the panda was all great too. We had a wheelchair user with us and staff were incredibly helpful too. Excellent!"

            "review": "Excellent Value - Great Way to Spend A Day. Here are my tips. Save 40 HKD by buying your ticket at China Travel Services (one location at Peking Rd and Nathan Rd, TST). They don't confiscate water at the gate so bring a bottle or pay 20 HKD for it outside (also vendor by the bus stop at Admiralty). Get there at opening 10 am and head for the cable car and work your way back. This will avoid the crowds and tour groups coming in later in the day. Jump on the Hair Raiser coaster first thing with no lines. Very confusing going to Marine World (lower section by Ferris Wheel) over to Rainforest side. Only access is by an overpass which opens at 10:30am. Loop under this overpass to get to the other parts of Marine World and to return back. You can't cross from the cable car (only heads back to Waterfront). Ocean Theatre closed for maintenance May 6 to June 7 2013. Don't worry about storage lockers for your backpack and cameras when going on a ride, you can leave it on shelves or baskets placed beside the embark point of the ride. Bring a poncho for the wet rides to keep dry or pay 30 HKD for one. Contrary to other older reports, McDonalds in Marine World more expensive than elsewhere. No combos offered - 24 HKD for a drink and 21 HKD for a Big Mac not including fries. Pandas at both Giant Panda Adventure and Sichuan Treasures. Don't miss the red pandas at the Giant Panda Adventure. Feeding for all pandas at 2pm. Don't miss North Pole Encounter and Arctic Fox Den both beside South Pole Spectacular but a bit hidden."

We went on a not so dry day, so the crowds were smaller, which was definitely a good thing. There are loads of different little attractions, many aimed at children, but adults can still definitely have a great day here. Get a bus from Admiralty MTR station - no MTR to Ocean Park. Its cheap and you can use your Octopus Card.There is an Asian animals sections, where you can see giant pandas and red pandas. Absolutely great attraction. We were lucky to see the keepers interacting and feeding the red pandas, so we got up close to their habitat and took great pictures. There are other animal exhibits too, gold fish, alligators, a rainforest enclosure and more - check out the park website for a list, but my absolute favourite was definitely the red panda. Even the giant panda exhibit was better than the one in Macau. There are animal shows as well - a bird show - which was good - if a little cheesy and mostly aimed at kids, but the sea lion and dolphin show is the main attraction and was great - lasting about 45 minutes I suppose. There is an aquarium here too. It not the best aquarium I've ever been too, but it was good, and had a good variety of tanks and fish and shark species. For me the best part was the cable car to the top of the park. It was terrific. The views of the park and surrounding area are lovely. At the top of the park there are fairground rides, a rainforest enclosure with birds and animals (the spider monkeys are gorgeous) a jellyfish exhibit (which was cool), a giant sturgeon exhibit, and the main theatre for the sea lion and dolphin show. There is just loads to see here, and many food stalls and restaurants to choose from. Allow a full day. Everything is free once you pay park admission. You obviously have to pay for food and souvenirs."

Unfortunately nothing was in English so I had a hard time figuring out what it was all about.After this I shot across to see the pandas - first in a larger exhibit but the pandas were hiding up the top and I couldn't see much. Then I went into the Asian adventure side and it was really sad.The giant pandas looked very agitated and bored, they both walked back and forth, hit the wall, turned around and did it again. It was like those children you see who rock from boredom. Pretty sad.Other than that I wasn't interested in any rides so I left early."

As you come outside of ths station, ther are some men asking for tickets to be puschased, we ignored as we already had them. Clearn indicatation at MTR guided us to the way outside MTR. There were alreast 5-7 busses waiting to pick all those heading woards OP.No. 629 takes you stratight to OPgood view of Hk Skyline as you cross to OPOnce you reach there (we reached 9:30am), there were already some queue to go inside. the park open by 10am.As soon as the gates opened, we headed startight the the cable car to take us to the other side of the mountain. the park is distributed on the other side of the mountain and you can go either by train called as ocean express or cable car. We preferred the cable car early.once we reached there, we had almost zero queues in lines and enjoyed most/all of the rides. It tool amlost 5-6 hours to complete all. Just when we thought all were done, the Mine Train was the most facinating that I felt.Tired and almost ...phew, we decied to head back via cable car again, Sadly the security guy announced a waiting time of ~2hr. we rushed to the Ocean express and reached down in 15 mins. Saw the giant aquarium and the pandas and relaxed.My kid ( 8 yrs) loved the the remote speeed bard for 8 dollars ....did it thrice.a very good family entertainer for all ages..most of the rides have a strict rule on the height and age. My son was stopped for many rides.Tips:I parks allows you to carry food/water. best to be take a bagpack and stull it with water, fruit jiuce etcif possibel carry a rain cort, there are 2 rider where you can get wet/soaked. Raincoat costs ther 30$try to finish the other side of the mountain first, in this want when you plan to cme back, you can be bit more relaxed.before you head back, make sure you dont miss the bird and whisker show.. starts at 5pm.lastly enjy the acquarium and its wonderful fushes....kids will love this.also enjoi the long starrs,..ther are atleaset 4 of them to reach from one to anothermust visit when you visit HK, Tomorrow is big buddha... ;)"

Its part zoo, part theme park, part fairground.The Panda enclosures are great even if the pandas are sometimes \"shy\". There are sea lions, red pandas, reptiles, and a huge aquarium containing all types of fish, sharks, ray, turtles etc. The aquarium is actually better than a lot of other stand alone aquariums that I have been to.As for the rides, there are several rollercoasters, river rapids type ride, observation tower, etc.However, on a pleasant day, the cable car ride is worth the admission alone! Fantastic views over the island and the south china sea and it can be so peaceful.Depending on queue times and how many of the rides you want to go on, I would suggest allowing between 4-6 hours - so its not a complete whole day out, but it will take up a large portion of one day. I arrived at 11am, and left about 4pm. One negative thing would be that you usually find yourself next to a very large group of noisy tourists, usually from mainland China which can really be annoying and frustrating, but that isn't the parks fault.TIP: hopefully its still there, but there is a Tourist Attraction Gift Shop in Admiralty MTR station as you exit to get the Ocean Park Bus. Its actually cheaper to buy your park entrance tickets there, rather than at the gate, which will also save you queuing at the entrance. They speak English too!"

Quick Summary: If you were to visit one theme park/zoo in Hong Kong, make it Ocean Park.Pros: Pandas, dolphins, cable car, rides, carnival games - all packed in one park. What more can you ask for?Cons: Can get really hot/humid in the summer; also long queues for special nights (e.g. weekends for the Halloween monthThis park has a bit for everyone. As a local I've visited this park a two dozen times and Disney maybe a dozen times. Forget Disney - THIS is the park you would want to visit.Save at least half a day for this park. You must:1) Visit the Pandas2) Visit the Ocean theatre3) Take the cable car - a 15 minute ride from one side of the park to the other (Ocean Park is situated on both sides of a mountain)4) Take the crazy long escalators5) Save some time for rides, carnival games, the aquarium, other animals, etc.6) Check out the special events. E.g. the month around Halloween will see OP transform into a haunted park with staff dressed as monsters running around scaring people in the park! All large indoor areas will be transformed into haunted houses where staff will scare you. Remember, no touching!Tips: - Avoid the hot months. If you can't, just make sure to go after 3pm. - Take the MTR to Admiralty and follow the signs to the bus (yellow double-decker buses) at the bus terminal.- Check park hours as they differ because of weekend/day and also special events- Eat at McDonald's. Everywhere else is slightly overpriced. Ocean theatre is nearby!- If you do go during the Halloween events, be SURE to purchase fastpasses earlier from their website. Lines can go up to 1hr+ for the better haunted houses"

We went primarily to see the Giant Aquarium (certified divers can apply to dive it) and shows, rather than ride the rides. I can see this place appealing to all ages rather easily. There were a ton of families with babies there, which I always think is strange but little kids were intrigued and happy, so it all seemed ok.We had coffee and a muffin in the bakery that were both very good (park prices though). The line for the Aquarium was a bit longer than we would have expected for a relatively low-attendance day and standing in line to walk through it was a bit odd. Once you get in, it is fairly well-designed and they have a good array of species. The walk-through parts with Hammerheads and Mantas flying by is easily my favorite -- awesome. There were a few interesting speicies of seahorse and an octopus, so some good opportunities to watch and be amazed. The stands for snacks were either out of everything or never really offered it. All they had was chicken legs and hot dogs. Like every theme park, all of the shows and rides dump you into shopping opportunities - I actually really don't like this feature of the parks - it cheapens the experience.Bad weather meant we weren't able to take the sky lift up or down the hill - so we ended up on the train. Crowds in China (even Hong Kong) seem to be quite pushy and it gets to be tedious, just be mentally prepared. We went to the bird show, pretty crowded, primarily in Cantonese and really short. Eh.All in all a good way to spend a day and pretty easy to do."

I recommend that you buy your entry ticket at the MTR as you can then skip the queues when you reach Ocean Park. The bus ticket is bought upstairs. They said that bus would take about 20 minutes but its more like 10 and they leave frequently as people get on. The park has plenty to offer, lots of attractions, animals, nice gardens, underwater world, dolphins and sea lions, shows, feeding of the pandas... things for young and old. My favorites were probably the Giant Pandas, the roller coasters and the cable cars. The queues weren't as bad as at Disneyland and there is a lot more to do and a lot more to choose from, not only when it comes to attractions but also the animals, the entry fee is lower and you get so much more then you get at DL.A couple of things tho... some of the small children cant go on certain rides due to height restriction, they need to be over 1.45cm... just as a note as I did see a few young ones crying their eyes out because they couldn't go on certain rides.

There was also Arctic and Antarctica enclosures (suitably \"cooled\" so take a jacket) with penguins, walruses, arctic foxes, seals. sealions etc (no polar bear tho). The rides area is separated from the animals (by a mountain!) and you have to go across either by cable car over and around, or a train through, the mountain. The rides are quite close to one another like a traditional amusement park with all sorts of roller coasters, dodgems/bumpcars (slowest most unexciting dodgems I've ever seen!), and other favourites - some of the animal encounters are also in this rides area.There are some decent restaurants on site, some affording great views of the coastline and sea from their elevated positions.All in all a good day out.

There are no belugas or killer whales like all the brochures / websites advertise as of April 2013. Go up on the train and come down on the cable car. You will need a whole day.

The shows are quite tacky and lacklustre. We took the MTR subway and at Admiralty got the special bus (629 I think) straight to Ocean Park and back again."

First of all it was hard to get to - the website said we could get a bus from Central station, but when we got there we were told the buses only went from Admiralty so we had to take the underground and then the bus, which took ages. When we got to the park, the queues to buy tickets were quite long, as there were only 2 ticket windows open. We were given no map or help finding our way around. You need to realise that most of the rides are a long way from the entrance and you have to take a cable car or a train to get to them so the queues for those are enormous. The signage is poor, we did get a map but had a lot of difficulty finding our way around and there are hardly any park staff to help. The food options were not great either, not enough restaurants and service was poor and rude. We got to go on 5 rides all day - not great value. Then there was a thunderstorm and they closed the cable car so the whole park had leave via the train (you cannot walk down) so we had to queue for over an hour just to leave the place. The best bit (which we almost missed because it is not highlighted) is that they have 2 giant pandas in an enclosure near the entrance so we saw them just as we were leaving! Overall, I cannot recommend this place, there are plenty of other theme parks around the world that are much better."

Ocean Park has grown year on year and with the MTR being extended to Aberdeen it will soon be a lot easier to get to, the park is extremely popular especially at weekends so if you can avoid visiting then it is best to do so. The Pandas are well worth the price of the entry ticket alone and the cable car ride gives fantastic views over Aberdeen and the sea. Food in the park is a bit hit and miss and the restaurants are always busy, queues form for the most popular rides from early in the day and they have not yet mastered Disney's ability to make waiting in line part of the ride.

Start with the thrilling cable car ride that will surely excite your senses especially then it goes up there to the High Land. Once in the high land, explore all the awesome rides. For the animal lover, this is also a good place to get to meet fantastic animals, enjoy the dolphin show and meet the seals. Also, do not miss to say \"hi\" to the panda and the the red raccoon. Enjoy the flamingo also and say \"hello\" to the marine creatures at the oceanaruim. Go back to the low land by riding the amazing train express.

They have really great rides for grown ups and older kids (and i would have enjoyed that for sure), but the offering for small children is poor. I have seen far better aquarium (and less crowded) - the Panda bear presentation made you feel super sorry for the animal (the one which was supposed to be active was just sleeping). The rides for small kids are really sad compared to Disneyland and some require excessive extra pay.Will not go there again until kids are at least 10 years old. If you visit Hong Kong with small kids and have limited time, rather go 1 days to Disneyland and the other to the Peak + Stanley."

The only down side is that it's a huge place. I was not able to watch all the shows and was not able to try all the attractions because I had to walk, walk, walk. If you have children with you, there are only a few rides that they can enjoy as most of the rides have height requirement and are really extreme. You need to arrive there very early if you want to fully enjoy the park. What I liked most was the Fountain show before the park closes.

Highly recommend going to Ocean Park,has everything from a cable car ride to rollercoasters and a massive aquarium,you can also see penquins and seals, great value for money. Tip though arrive early as the crowd builds very quick once opened although even with thousands of people you still do not have to wait all that long in line for things"

I loved Ocean Park - it is such a fun place to visit and has a lot of different amusements including animal exhibits (we saw fish, panda bear, birds and seals) and also has some really fun rides like roller coasters and the like. It is well laid out so you can visit all different areas. The cost of entry was alos very reasonable considering it is definitely a day's worth of entertainment. However, I can imagine that it would get so crowded during peak times and we had to wait quite a long time (30 minutes or more) to get onto the most popular rides. Highly recommended! If I went back to HK I probably wouldn't go back but only because I've already been there, but having said that, I do think it is an excellent way to spend time."

            "review": "A bit dated......but ok. Ocean Park I feel was probably amazing 10/15 years back, but if you've ever been to a Disney Park, it makes Ocean Park seem a bit old and dated. However everyone there seemed to be enjoying themselves.It cost 280$HK entry and once inside all rides are free, I went on a Wednesday and there wasn't really much waiting time for rides which was good. It's very spread out up the cliff top aside the coast (which can add to thrill of some rides) so be prepared to do a lot of walking. The cable car ride was good as the views were pretty amazing, in fact you get great views most of the way round the park, which is a plus. Once you get to the end of the park as its so spread out they provide a free shuttle back to beginning, you have to get your hand stamped for re entry otherwise you can't get back in....i found the bus ride a bit odd, you actually leave the park and are back outside on the busy roads of Hong Kong for about 20 minutes (depending on traffic I guess) before once again back at the start. Anyway the re entry is worth it for the light and water show which they put on at 7pm each night. It was quite impressive so you should definitely stick around for this. The dolphin show was also good.To get to Ocean Park I took the metro to Admiralty on the Island Line and from there you take the bus number 629 which goes directly to the park, there was a lot of people waiting for the bus but you don't wait long as they have several buses all waiting at once, so it was fairly quick. The bus fair is an additional 10.60$HK each way, use your octopus card or have the right change to pay.Overall, I think if you don't go to this park with high expectations i.e. don't be expecting Disney standards then I'm sure you will enjoy it. For me one visit is enough, if only for the views."

            "review": "Marvellous attraction. Ocean Park is a mixture of rides, aviary and aquarium. The fun-fair type rides are exciting, although not exceptional bu comparison with some modern theme parks. The roller coaster is longer than most, and contains three loops. There is a detonator-type attraction, which is the highest that I have seen, and there are a variety of gentler rides for the fainter hearted. The aviary is a walk-through atttraction, covering about an acre of ground, and containing an amazing variety of colourful tropical birds, with a selection of ground-living birds and water-fowl as well. The enormous aquarium is viewed at four levels - on the surface, and then at three deeper levels through large viewing panels in the sides of the fifty-metre tank. There is a seperate, large, jellyfish display. There is also an impressive sea-lion enclosure, visible on two levels - above and below the surface.The whole site is in two parts, joined by a cable-car which connects the two in a ten-minute ride. The lower, smaller part contains a large enclosure containing giant pandas. we were told that the numbers varied according to arrangements with other establishments; there were eight pandas present when I was there. The staff are all friendly, and all speak very good English. Access is by bus from a site on Hong Kong Island called Admiratly, where combination admission and bus tickets are on sale. The park tends to be busy; it is recommended that Chinese holidays, especially New Year, are avoided by tourists."

One such ride is where you are kept inverted at a height for some time and then brought back ...

The food was okay- they have opened several higher end restaurants recently, and things were edible (very picky kids) but not anything you would go out of your way for.

Gradually this park has added white knuckle rides and candy floss, plus a bit of twee olde Hong Kong nostalgia to become a park for all seasons. However, somehow the combination works and for a young family the Nature of which there really is quite a lot from dolphins and seals to tiny marmosets and large sloths is exotic and intriguing. Plus there are those rides so loved of children of all ages.The Park certainly has a bit of class and pulls off the odd mix with panache.

There is also an aquarium which was cleverly designed as you start at the top and work your way through passages of many creatures down to the bottom. There were other creatures to see in the rainforest area and north and south pole areas and also pandas. All animals seemed content.There are also cable cars getting you from one area to another but these are not suitable for anyone with a fear of heights as they go along a hill edge and there is a huge drop below into the ocean. Amazing views from the cable cars though. There is also a viewing tower for those who like to feel a bit more stable.I would recommend this place and we all had an excellent day out."

When you get off at this station you can follow the sign board to the bus (Exit B I think, bus no-629) to Ocean Park. You have to buy the bus ticket which costs HKD10 each way per adult. Advisable to purchase return ticket.For Park ticket they can be purchased online and you get the voucher which can be exchanged for tickets at a separate counter dedicated for online/vouchers. Alternatively you may buy the tickets at any 7 eleven. Cost is the same everywhere HKD240.Or stand in the long queue and purchase ticket at the entrance directly.Park has 2 sections. The summit and other one has the Panda/old town and etc. etc\u2026 suggest to do the Summit 1st when you arrive. As all the staggering rides are here.We enjoyed all the rides except space ride. It makes you feel giddy. Or could be other reason as we did all the rides and this was the 2nd last.All the rides are worth waiting in the queue. Wonderful Hair Raiser, Flash. Rev Rooster doesn\u2019t look that great but once you sit you have a great time. All rides are mindboggling.Wear you most comfortable flip-flops or any comfortable footwear it\u2019s quite a good walk whole day.To eat you have quite a few options. 1hour before the park closing they have light and water show. Do not miss. Its once of the best thing. Try to stand to the right side where you have the small boats in water you will not get wet and you can shoot the entire water show.Rest you may explore yourself, why wait go ahead enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!"

Smaller children loved the Whiskers harbour! There were not huge queues and we were able to have rides on everything we wanted to. The dolphin and sealion show was a highlight. The arctic blast rollercoaster was the perfect introductory rollercoaster for the 5 year old. The pandas, penguins, arctic foxes, toucans are a really neat addition to a theme park day. We spent the entire day there and definitely recommend staying to see Symbio. Symbio was more impressive than HK Disneyland's fireworks! The souvenirs are pricey, as is the food. They let us take in drink bottles but stopped us taking in our fruit and biscuits. If you've been to any other Disneyland, and have to decide between HK Disneyland and Ocean Park we recommend you go to Ocean Park. It is a unique attraction whereas the Disneyland is the same experience you can have at any Disneyland."

The evenings are a mix experience at the park, as when pretty late, most of the rides gets less visited and its a good time to quickly get to participate in them.

The food is pricey but good. The rides are amazing Roller Coasters on a cliff who would have thought! But this is Hong Kong and everything is always done on a grand scale. Ride the tram to the top for all the big rides, the view is something else. When you are done there you can take the tram back down or the better yet take the Ocean Express.. When i saw this train my first thought was Harry Potter. Also visit the panda's. All in all we had a wonderful time here and will be returning next year to spend a full day."

I never had to queue more than 5 mins on weekday in May! Get your tickets at the airport to avoid a long wait to get a ticket at the park entrance. Also, wear comfortable shoes because it can be a long walk between rides and some pathways are uphill. Give yourself half a day at the park."

I went there with my family and the original intention was to see the panda (ying ying and le le).It was easily reached by bus from Admiralty station, and it is hugeee!!Apart from the panda, we saw a lots of show attraction, riding roller coaster, and there is even a long ride by cable car or train to separate the section. It took us a whole day to see the whole theme park. This feels like zoo and theme park combination. There are a lot of nice spots for picture taking.note: grab a map on your entrance to check the show schedule!"

Although it was quite tiring during the walks there and here, it was still great! You can purchase the tickets in the entrance and get a map of the place so you wont get lost. I suggest to go the other side of the mountain first before explore the site near the entrance. It's best to ride the cable car first going to the other side so you can see the whole place. When you get to the other side, enjoy the rides, watch the penguin show and then you can go back to the site near the entrance through the underground train. You can find the location via map. Enjoy the place until the closing, don't go home yet before the closing they have this 3D show in the fountain area. It's really great, better find a good spot for it, (The front near the tables is really a great spot.) Then enjoy the performance, it's around 10 to 15 mins. It's breath taking so don't miss any of it."

We got the bus from Admiralty MTR (1st queue), but you are moving all the time. Strongly suggest buying tickets ahead of visit (at a 7-11 store) or another major queue when you get there. We decided to catch the cable car to the far side of the Park first which took over an hour - but you are moving all the time. Once over the other side we went straight for a coffee where we had the most stunning views of the bays and South China Sea. We were not interested in the rides but wanted to see the animals. Amazing exhibits in good surroundings. We loved the penguins, walrus, pandas, and the very impressive aquarium. And never thought I would be so taken by an exhibit of jellyfish - very clever. Well worth a visit, but avoid their public & school holidays if possible."

It really has a lot packed in here for the money. There are rollercoasters and rides, a zoo, live performances and also an aquarium. Its split into 2 parts and you need to take the cable car (or there is a train if you dont like heights) between them, which itself is very nice and gives you a good view of the islands. Ate in the chinese restaurant here and the price was reasonable and the food was good. As i visited during the chinese new year, the place was heaving, there was a lot of queuing involved for some of the attractions but then again hardly any elsewhere in the park. A tip would be to get in early and head for the other side of the park and work backwards ( i headed for the rollercoasters early just in case there were queues later). Another tip is to take the cable car over to the other part but take the express train back, when i was there, most people seemed to go for the cable car back and there were huge queues. The train however, seemed to be a lot more organised, still queuing involved but it moved along nicely. The final bit of advice (if you are still there) is to watch the fountain show at 7pm before leaving the park. I was on my way out when i heard the announcement so stayed on to watch and wasnt disappointed. Overall good day out for family and friends."

A favourite was the water display and the remote control boats. We ate at the panda restaurant. Wasn't cheap but the food was generous in portion size and fresh. The kids meals were huge and included spaghetti bolognaise, fish and chips, fruits salad and jelly. I had the pork dim sum and it was divine. Totally recommend the panda buns filled with warm custard.There is lots to see and do. The rides are endless and there are numerous animal shows to see.

The base area near the entrance consists of an aquarium, a theme market named \"Old Hong Kong\" and few other small attractions. But the real fun is on the mountain top which is connected to the base through cable cars. The cable car ride to the mountain top is an exhilarating experience in itself. All the rides are exiting but the most notable is \"hair raiser\" the floor-less roller coaster. The rain forest section is also good fun. Staffs are friendly and amenities are good. Food options are limited though. If you have kids you may stop to enjoy the live shows performed at the base area.I also liked the \"Old Hong Kong\" market which showcases heritage of Hong Kong and offers plenty of local traditional food. Though the place becomes very crowded on weekends in particular. The long queue for the cable car from the base is an irritant. Overall the place is extremely enjoyable and big enough to keep you occupied for a whole day...Being located far off from the city centre it not connected by Metro yet. Though I had seen metro work in progress when I had visited this place last in mid 2012. Big Bus has a hop off/hop on point near the park gate."

The aquarium and \"amazing Asian animals\" section near the entrance is fantastic. The 4 pandas were incredible to see up close and the staff were very knowledgeable and friendly. Everything was well-kept, clean, and organized. In the other section of the park (up the mountain) also has some animal exhibits -- a north pole and south pole section. Remember to bring a sweater, because those areas are kept quite cold! I loved the penguins and the artic fox. Very cute! Dining options are okay -- of course everything is overpriced, but the beef soup noodles I had at the Panda Cafe were decent (80 HKD). If you bring a picnic, there are some good public areas with picnic benches where you can sit. The cable car is a must, however this was the longest lineup of the day. We waited about 40 mins. At least they have umbrellas along the way, so you aren't getting sunburnt while you wait! The view from the cable car was spectacular! On the way back, we took the tram, which was way faster although less scenic (it goes through the mountain, so it's just a tunnel of darkness). We did not go on many rides, because just looking at all the animal exhibits can take up the better part of a day. Still, despite the expensive ticket price, I felt this was definitely worth it."

We would have been far better off buying 2 day tickets to Hong Kong Disneyland rather than spending one day in each theme park. Disneyland is a huge step above Ocean Park in terms of quality and also has very good systems to handle large crowds including posting wait times and scheduled fast track line options for the most popular rides. Disneyland has a global brand name to protect. Ocean Park needs to try better to emulate its more savvy rival. If you decide to go to Ocean Park anyway, do so on a work day and hopefully you will have a better experience than we did."

A must to go!Try out the cable car: that is safe and fun, and you would see a side of beautiful of Hong Kong Island, you have to try it.If you come over during October, they would have a theme which called \"Haunt House\", and only opened for that during the night. many Halloween theme haunt housed and you would have a good time there, tickets should be booked in advance.Only one more opinion, please don't watch too many dolphin shows there. As too many mainland chinese come here and keep watching the dolphin shows, they made the dolphin over work everyday (almost 6 shows a day, due to the HK articles). It is very sad. It would be seriously harming their routine life. Be a animal lover."

Myself also had to remind 3 times a father with his 2 sons to stop pushing us and trying to over-take us - incredible.- Park separated in 2 areas - must ride cable-car or train...with additional queue to go there and...to leave the park ! Never seen that in my life, I would like to explain my and many other tourists frustration to the park designer!!!- Bad organization - inefficient staff.- Rides not for small children (min height) - don't understand so strict, no problem for similar ride in Disneyland HK.- Few places to eat, poor variety, mainly snacks (restaurants are for the \"rich\" - over over priced). And guess what? You even have to queue for 15-30min to have a simple snack.- Far distances between the rides, prepare for a \"marathon\" day, up and down, not flat field (thanks again to the park designer).I know this was during peak season, but we visited Disneyland 2 days before, and the experience was totally different and within our high expectations. OceanPark was a total waste of our precious holiday time. Pls make a favour to yourself: erase this park from your list. Disneyland is around 40% more expensive, but you come back from there with an happy family and the feeling of not haven't been ripped from your money."

There are two panda areas. The first one near the entrance was absolutely packed (even though we had arrived early) and was more a case of 'click a photo, move on.' There is a second area further back which we stumbled on and was pretty much empty. Just us and the pandas so we could enjoy their antics without the crowds. The penguins were gorgeous and the air conditioning was a lovely respite from the heat.Ocean Park is very well laid out and extremely clean. Eating options are limited with many of them being stalls/stands. We found an indoor cafe which served very average food at high prices. Due to the lack of shady places to sit and eat this was our only choice on a stinking hot day. I agree wholeheartedly with many reviewers regarding the rudeness of visitors from Mainland China. I was almost physically pushed out the way by a rude older woman who just glared at me when I told her not to be rude and wait her turn. Be prepared for their pushiness as it can spoil your day if you are not used to it. Overall I would visit Ocean Park again but maybe in winter next time!"

I was faced with the choice of Hong Kong Disney or Ocean Park. I was about to choose the familiar Disney but many locals (even the Concierges at the upscale Hong Kong Shangri-la Hotel) convinced me to try Ocean Park, in that it had a more local theme, was less expensive, less crowded (very few non-Chinese tourists) and had many interesting attractions. And they were right! Only about a 20 minute taxi ride from central Hong Kong, the park is set on a beautiful hillside which makes the coastal water views from the park and the rides and on the cable car, very beautiful. They have very interesting and fun rides and a Chinese market section as well as more local food concessions than typical fast food franchises. It was definitely a different experience from your typical Disney and while you can always visit a Disney, you'll have to visit Hong Kong to visit Ocean Park."

Although the lineups were not as bad as disneyland, we had a 3.5 year old (who is quite tall for her age), and a 13 month old. Disneyland catered for both children with all the rides. Ocean Park was clearly for kids aged maybe 7+ years old, to be allowed on any rides to start with. While we went to Ocean Park expecting a Sea World (Australia) type experience (instead of a theme park with rides), we were disappointed on that front too. Ive seen just as good, if not better, animal displays in zoos in Australia, and at Sea World. The few animals there didnt take that long to meander through, which left you the choice of going on rides (not if you have young kids), or queuing for ridiculously long times to see one of the shows. The guide booklet for the park did have minimum height requirements written down for each ride. We realised that one of the ONLY rides our 3 year old could go on was right at the bottom of the park on the other side- which we couldnt see was accessible (with a stroller) on the escalators that go down and down and down.... so we were pointed around a ramp/walkway that would allow us to get down there. Im not joking when I say we were walking around the side of the mountain for half an hour. Then we we got 5 minutes away from the ride someone told us that the ride was closed for maintenance. We couldnt get out of the park fast enough. Probably wouldnt return even when the kids are older, just a bad experience all round.On another note, the signs were very unclear in their directions for wheelchair and stroller access- I cant tell you how much time we wasted going in circles and asking staff who seemingly had no idea either."

Plus factor also are the presence of escalators located on the mountain side. Plenty of cool and screaming rides to choose from and their marine aquarium is just great!!!!"

            "review": "Overrated -no comparison to Disney!. Before entering the park I had the mindset that Ocean Park was going to be awesome and outrank and beat its fellow counterpart - Disneyland, due to reviews I had read. I had planned my holiday in Hong Kong so that the best would be saved for last, so our last day would be spent in Ocean Park, how wrong I was! On its own, the park is good but when compared with HK Disneyland, I would be leaning to Disney. If you are tossing up which park to visit (and you don't have time to visit both, then the following information may help you). Negatives (when compared to Disneyland):Very spread out, you have to walk quite far to access attractions and rides. The 'summit' area has little linked circuits and many dead ends. For example, we had to walk down a slope, then two long escalators, a flight of steps and a path to reach the mine cart roller coaster. There was nothing else down here so we had to go all the way back. About 10/15 mins sent just getting back up. Valuable time that could be spent on rides!The terrain is very up and down. People with mobility issues, not good with walking will have difficulty here. So many stairs, it puts you off visiting certain areas as you know you will have to walk back all the way you take to get to the attraction. Where as in disney there are not dead ends, everything is flat, there are limited stairs (maybe a couple here and there), attractions are closer together = more time spent on rides. I didn't find the staff as helpful as Disney members were. Many staff struggle with English, yet they work in a popular tourist destination? For example, we decided to have a hotdog for lunch and went to purchase be from the hotdog cart nearby. I wanted a normal hotdog, my brother wanted a signature hotdog (aka. Hot dog with extras). The man who served us had no clue what a signature hotdog was. He told us he only had one type (in very poor English - he seemed very confused by our order), yet the people before and after us, had the signature dogs. He had to check with someone and still told us there were no signature dogs when clearly on the board they said they had them. We just gave up and my brother had the plain one instead.The eating places around the park were limited. Yes, there were heaps of places to eat, but many of them sold the same thing as each other. I found Disneyland had more variety. One of the major issues I had with this park was its inefficiency in ride preparation. For each ride there are waiting bays with numbers to organise the next riders while the ride is in progress - well that's what they used them for at Disneyland, the staff here had no concept of waiting bays. Instead they would waste time by allowing people to wait in a massive line, then guess a rough number of people who would fit on the ride let them through to CHOOSE their seat. That is a problem in itself - people chop and change their mind and change seats while you are trying to find an empty one. People literally push to get the 'good seats' - the front and back. I don't see why it is done this way when it would be more efficient to have people waiting and being told where to sit so they are ready to get on the ride. I found this quite frustrating.One last negative (just because I am really picky). The queuing area was non-stimulating. At Disney, the queues are themed to match the ride and there are quite a lot of different scenery to look at as you progress through the line. Ocean Park however, limits their scenery to metal chains and poles. Positives:Symbio - the water/laser/firework show at night was great and is almost on par with the equivalent at Disneyland.There are a huge selection of rides accounting for various age groups. There are more roller coasters here then at disney.Little queues for this time of year. Highly recommend travelling in winter. I think the longest queuing time was about 20mins. Animal sections were great. All of them were active and on show. The red pandas were especially cute. There is spectacular scenery, especially from the summit area. Very good for taking photos. The cable car ride to the summit is also VERY worthwhile. I know this review seems highly negative, but many people had told me prior to my visit how much better this park is to Disneyland - so I had huge expectations when I saw how fantastic Disneyland was run. Ocean Park did not live up to these expectations, but in saying that, I still enjoyed my day (as tiring as it was), the rides and the night show. I'm not saying don't visit, Im just giving you all the facts so you know exactly want to expect and don't end up as disappointed as I was."

            "review": "Great Day Out. My partner and I spent an entire day at Ocean Park and enjoyed the day immensely. We went there on a tour I organised via viator and when the guide told us we would be there from 10 until 5, i initially thought that it was going to be hard to fill in so many hours but, happily, I was proven to be wrong as there was plenty to see and do during the time we were there. We decided to go straight to the upper park via the cable car. This was a great experience and we got great views of the surrounding area. The upper park included lots of attractions, the highlight probably being the dolphin and seal show. The whole message behind the show is about humans respecting the oceans and its creatures and although some people criticise these sorts of shows, we were impressed with the genuine care and affection the handlers showed towards their charges. We also enjoyed the time we spent inside the polar display and got a good view of the penguins. Other highlights of our visit included viewing the pandas and the red pandas who were very active and quite enchanting. We had a very nice lunch at the terrace restaurant. It was very tasty and not at all expensive and the view from this area is also stunning. As others have observed, this park is quite hilly but if you are reasonably fit, getting around is not difficult. We also visited in January when the weather was quite mild - I imagine it would not be quite so easy to get around in very hot weather! We chose to visit Ocean Park in preference to Disneyland and were very pleased with our choice."

However, we went with our 5 year old daughter, who loves roller coasters (she did the ones in HK Disney the week before) and she was not tall enough to ride on all but one of them. She was also to young for the 'swim with' attractions - swim with the dolphin, sea lion, etc. We had a good day there, but it would have been a great day if she was taller. In fact, we probably would not have gone if we knew going in that she would not be able to ride most of the attractions (and there are some great ones). Another note - we ate at Neptune's restaurant, in the park. It is AWESOME! HUGE aquarium, so you eat while watching over 100' x 50' (my estimate) of hammer head sharks, sting rays, sea turtles etc. Good food, too, overall this meal was a highlight of our 3+ week trip. Lastly, be prepared to WALK. A lot. Up hill, downhill. Take the cable car to get from the lower park to the upper, and back again, its better than the train. We went on a weekday, the weather (Jan 2013) was perfect for the day, high 60s Fahrenheit. There were NO lines to speak of on any of the rides, which was great."

It has a combination of younger children attractions, some wild rides (for the teen group) and a small but well maintained animal section. We really came to see their giant and red Pandas and we were not disappointed. The Panda section is in a quiet corner away from all the noise - in fact you would not know you were in a theme park and the enclosures are designed that you feel you can reach out and touch the animals, they are so close. We also went to the Polar experience where we saw seals and penguins - they even provide real ice for them to sit on - wonderful (but take a jumper it was freezing in the exhibition) We arrived about noon - and the park was quite quiet - however at about 2.30pm it suddenly filled up and the queues were huge.The park is easily reached from a No 70 bus to Aberdeen."

Perhaps it was this that caused us to be so greatly dissapointed. The rides felt run down and in need of repair. The park is split in to two areas and you need to take a train or cable car to get from one to another. We tried the cable car as it looked like the views would be great travelling across the mountain, however after a one hour wait (with impatient kids) the only thing we experienced was fear from a cable car that felt like it would collapse over one bump. The biggest issue I had was that my seven year old was not able to go on many of the rides. This was especially frustrating as he could ride every single attraction at Disneyland and Universal Studios in Singapore. Perhaps it's due to the poor construction of the rides. I would personally not recommend to anyone."

However, it is so much more then that... The best bit was seeing the pandas as we had not realised there were any in Hong Kong. The park is very spread out so you have to take the cable cars to get to the other side of the hill, but the view from them is fantastic. Lots of roller coasters and flume type rides to go on, and when they say you will get wet they are not joking, but it is all part of the fun, and you dry out pretty quickly in the heat. The bird show is short but worth going to see, you can get the main gist of the talk even if you do not understand chinese. It is the first time we have seen a trained vulture. We brought our tickets at the bus station on Hong Kong Island, then caught the shuttle bus, which saved standing in line at Ocean Park itself. The price was the same. Well worth a visit, but plan to spend a whole day there."

We were there mainly for the penguin encounter, overall it was fun to meet the penguins (always exciting to get up close to animals) but for $880 it was not that worth it. The majority of the time is spent on boring classroom talk (an hour), then 5 mins watching the penguins get weighed and maybe 5 mins out in the exhibit (we were dressed in black and white penguin jackets for display in the exhibit too). Feeding was not by hand but just thrown in the tray which the penguins don't like very much, they prefer being fed by hand or thrown in the water which we weren't allowed to do. I guess in order to protect and respect the penguins not much can be done, but for 10 mins interaction with them and $100 for a photo it was just less fun than I expected but a special experience nonetheless. We didn't go to all the rides or the Whisker's Harbour (kiddie zone) but I would assume 4 hours would cover the whole park (especially on a weekday). I think a must-do is to make a reservation at Neptune's Restaurant at the aquarium and request the corner tables which are exactly by the aquarium wall instead of just looking from afar. The aquarium was absolutely the highlight for me and I could spend all day there just watching the huge manta ray and sharks swim by. Food, as expected was quite awful, but an absolute must go for lunch or dinner. Then I would suggest heading to the panda exhibit if there's not a super long line and then taking the cable car over to the summit side (seems like more people take cable car back at the end of the day) and taking the ocean express (10min ride) back when you leave. Once over at the summit you could plan around the shows according to schedule and exhibits (very small exhibits, with no lines each would probably take 5mins). The less scary rides had the longest lines (rides at Adventure Land, whirly bird swings, arctic ride, bumper cars, raging river rides etc) so probably best to go to the ones you really want first, and jump on the scary ones on the way (hair raiser roller coaster, the flash etc), by around 5pm most tours have left and you could probably go on all the rest of the rides very quickly before rides close at 6pm (park closes at 7pm). Overall great fun, the park is very easy to get to (very close to town), and rides and seeing animals are always fun."

There are many great rides on the upper level, which can be reached by a wonderful cable car ride providing excellent views of the surrounding bays. There are seal and penguin enclosures, though these are relatively small and seem to be in subdued light providing a less than enlightening experience. On the lower level there is a large aquarium although the crowds make viewing difficult at times. The best exhibits are the pandas largely because they seemed, during our visit at least, to be largely ignored.At the entrance to the cable car is a tacky area described as Old Hong Kong, which is an excuse for fairground games with simply hideous prizes.One bonus is the little cafe to the right of the entrance, which is passed by by the coach loads of trippers, where you can get a decent cup of coffee and a snack.Overall, this is a great place for young people but an average experience for seniors, who do not get any senior concessions unless they are Hong Kong residents."

The animal kingdoms including big aquarium, panda zoo and penguin are among main attraction here. Further up using cable car, excitement are waiting for those who want to challenge their adrenaline rush with exciting rides. The one that cannot be missed out is Ocean Theatre show with awesome Dolphin and sea lions show."

We caught a bus to the park from one of the metro stops and also bought our park tickets there at the bus stop. The trip is not long so jump on a bus and stand to avoid the wait for a seat. The rides at the park are tame if you have done Disney or Universal Studios or I suppose Six Flags but one or two of the roller coasters still provide enough of a thrill for the boys! We loved the penguin, seals and the aquariums here and the pork buns in the old Hong Kong section. Our two teens enjoyed themselves and the cable car is a great ride for them. A good family day out and we are glad we went. Bus service to and from the park is efficient and the park and facilities are very clean as we have found them always to be in HK."

The rides are good, look new and have a wide variety. Impressive selection of animals, pandas, snakes, monkeys ect The food is average however very well priced for a theme park.Entry price was about half what I have paid for theme parks this size is the past and it was superior in quality. The day I went it was overcast but not raining, Saturday and in autumn - All ride waits were under 12 minutes, many had no wait times. Bring a raincoat as you get wet on some rides."

I personally think the cable car is better than the train- but it's just my opinion. once we got to the summit, we went on the hair raiser. it is a fantastic ride- with no floor. very thrilling but not for the fraidy cats! next we went on the bumper cars- a lot of fun with family. we did a few other rides, but then we went to Bay View Restaurant for lunch. very nice, but a bit to fancy for a casual weekend. but I must admit- the food and view were spectacular! we then finished off with with a few good rides, and went back on the cable car. of you visit regulary, get an annual pass- it saves a LOT of time!"

Do take the cable car ride. Although it's scary like hell, but it's really a good way to appreciate the scenery of HK island south. The rides were fun too, very suitable for teenagers and couples. Also, they have a number of enclosures and aquarium. Quite nice i must say. The jellyfish one was one of the coolest one I've seen. Also, don't waste time watching the dolphin show. The queue to get in is crazy and the show does not have much entertainment value. It's basically repeating the same stun over the 20-30 mins performance. Catch the bird show instead, although it's in cantonese, you really get to experience the HK culture / life.It's hard to dispute that this park is still one of the best parks in Asia."

Ocean Park is on the southern side of HK island and is reached by either taxi or a multitude of different bus routes which go directly to it (the new MTR line is schedule for completion in 2014/2015 I think).The park itself is a nice theme park, and is around HK$100 less than Disneyland, so if you're looking for a cheaper option, this could the go. The park layout is split into two main sections, you have the main part of it around the entrance which is home to most of the aquatic and wildlife exhibits and the Summit section, which is home to the parks roller coasters and thrill rides. The bottom part is where most people start and provides some very well done exhibits for marine life and local wildlife. The main aquarium in particular is massive and a must-see. To access the Summit section, you can travel by either the famous cable-car over the mountain, or the new tram/train ride. The cable car is the much more scenic option, but is also normally a lot busier and slower. Would recommend catching the cable car on the way up, and the tram/train back down (much smaller queue usually). The Summit section is the thrill ride part of the park, and has a good selection of rides. The biggest and best of them all is their new floorless coaster, \"Hair Raiser\". A good coaster and pretty cool location situated on the side of the mountain, with great views out over southern HK island and the South China Sea. Other notable good rides include the Dragon coaster, the Mine Train coaster, Arctic Blast and the Flash. The rapids ride is very average and quite short and the log flume ride was unfortunately closed for refurb during our visit, but looks like a fun ride. The polar walk-thru exhibits are also worth while checking out.Overall, the park is entertaining and fun, but not in the same league as major theme parks like Disneyland and Universal Studios. If you arrive at opening when the crowds are small, you could probably see and do everything within half a day easily."

It is a real treat to the eyes to see such a colorful sea life, indeed one of the best part of the park. Further, in the Amaing Asian Animal section, lazy Panda\u2019s activities and Red Panda are delightful to watch. Bird shows and adventure show (sky fare) were also good.Journey to the hilltop thru a long rope was is just amazing. Thrilled to see the sea and mountain below the trolley. The roller coaster on the top of the hill (especially the \u2018Hair Raiser\u2019) was out of the world and best I ride I had so far.It\u2019s fun to watch playful Penguins, Sea Lions and Walrus in the north and south pole sections. Birds like \u2018Toucan Ramphastos\u2019 and fish like \u2018Pirhana & Electric Eels\u2019 increases the interest element in the visit of Rain Forest. A good bird eye view of Ocean park as well Hong Kong\u2019s beauty can be enjoyed from Ocean Tower.Several restaurants are available at various place to fill you up while exploring the park. The best part of the park is the Ocean Theater where Dolphins and Sea Lions perform unbelievable activities. Dolphins were very more active and entertaining compared to lazy Sea Lions. This show has typical timings and make sure you don\u2019t miss it any cost.There were several more attraction available in the park and definitely it is impossible to cover the whole park in just one day no matter how early you reach there. Journey back to downhill thru Ocean express was okay but very fast (3 minutes only). The fire, lighting and fountain show as closing ceremony was fantastic.Overall it is one of the best Amusement Park I even been, wishing to visit it again.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"

We (2 adults and a 5 year old) had a unplanned last minute trip to Ocean Park, wanting to fill in some time before our plane took off! Thankfully there were some locker facilities so we could pile all our onboard luggage into them and set off to explore the park.It was a little rushed, but we expected that and actually, managed to fit in a fair bit to our 3 hours that we were there. As the admission fees are very reasonable (compared to Australian prices), we were fine with only being there a short time.The pandas were great, as were the goldfish, which we thought were hilarious! The north and south pole exhibits were fantastic, especially our underwater encounter with the walrus (admittedly, there was 60cm of glass between us). The aquarium was also great, especially the hammerheads.The dolphin/seal show was okay...but the crowds, especially the large tour groups, made it quite unpleasant. There was a whole lot of pushing and discourtesy, which was frustrating and did detract from the enjoyment of the day. Not sure what you could do to avoid this, except perhaps expect it and do you best to laugh at the situation.We didn't go on any rides as our 5 year old was just under the height restriction and the kiddie rides were too young for him. Thankfully, we had already been at Disneyland earlier that week, so didn't really feel like we missed out. Food was very average, although we just had a quick snack of hotdogs.Some of the park is a bit 'plastic' and there are certainly sections that could do with some much needed renovation, but overall...it was a great way to spend a few hours and expend some of our 5 year old's energy before a 15 hour flight. It doesn't quite have the magic of Disneyland, but the animals were great to see, so that made it worthwhile. If you wanted to make the most of the park, you would want to be there for at a full day and the rides really cater for those over the age of 8+."

It takes you up and over the edge of a huge hill top and the view is totally spectacular on the other side as you head towards the other half of the park - quite spectacular. There is plenty to do here - the aquarium is great and has an array of large fish and reptiles, the (new) Polar section is brilliant, the enclosures and pools are huge! You can really get a good view of the animals from above and underwater too. There is a lovely dolphin and sealion show, again in a large pool, and plenty of other animals to see. Giant pandas get swamped (mostly by Chinese tourists taking pictures) so they always seem to look a little weary but they are there and they have nice enough enclosures. There are big thrill rides and plenty of carts and restaurants, and I really enjoyed myself. Also the bus service from Admiralty is brilliant and really well-organised."

It's impossible to see whole park at one day but it's not only about the people - OP is very big, not only having park with animals, but shows with dolphins, cable car, rollercoaster etc. and if you have birthday you can enter for free but only if you're a resident of HK (maybe something has changed but I'm not sure)There was someone complaining about no typhoon refund - people are not responsible for weather and HK is full of typhoons, if they had to give money back every time there's a typhoon to every person it wouldn't be a good business. Just for future - use a public wifi to check on official site of HK gov about weather warnings - usually you know about afternoon typhoon in the morning so when you wake up you can avoid places like this if there's typhoon on the way."

I understand cultural differences but, spitting pissing and smoking anywhere you please is not cultural; its lack thereof.) Since it's expansion, Ocean park has become much more feature rich and better for repeat visits. i have a monthly pass and try to go during low tourist times (which is not many). The overall design of human traffic for rides and transport is overall on par with Disneyland. Not an easy thing to do. disney knows their crowd logistics and apparently so does Ocean Park. Especially since they revamped the aquarium and the entrance. Ocean Park has a good mix of rides for the kids and adults; plus the botanical/aquarium portion lets you slow down and relax a little. recommend if you have a day and want to get a variety of park types into one big park. best amusement park in hong kong."

Hight restrictions on many of the rides are unnecessary - surely it's the role of parents to judge if a ride is appropriate for their kids.

There is various wildlife on-show here and it is one place you can see the pandas (and I also enjoyed seeing the walrus).On the negative side the food is of a poorer quality and even the western food (like a hotdog) has an asian style to it so if you looking for something simple to eat you might not get what you expect. Wait times for the rides is an issue even when the queues don't seem long. One reason is that they allow for you to take yours bags into the ride area and then store them in baskets. This seem to creates a Benny Hill style drama with people getting on and off and on off and on and off before the rides can even start.The souvenirs (stuffed animals) appear to of poor quality and not to the same standard that you would get at HKD.Overall I think that this is still a good place to spend the day with your kids but like HKD plan to go when it is not packed."

We didn't have to queue to get tickets and they cost 280 HKD each. The park is in 2 sections with the mountain in between. A cable car or train links the two. The cable car was awesome, great views and we only queued around 15 minutes for it. I think that we visited on the best day because the weather was clear and from my experience of theme parks it was very quiet. We headed for The Hair Raiser roller coaster which again had no queue, it was really good fun! The park services were excellent and all toilets were well kept and clean. There was a good range of rides for adults and young children and the zoo aspect really added to the experience. Food options were not so great however. We ended up having a Macdonalds because it is normally a safe bet and this was the longest queue we had all day. The other food options just didn't look so nice but we normally expect to eat fast food in a theme park so this was fine. We watched the dolphin and sea lion show which has spectacular views and the show was good, much better than the dolphin show in Singapore! The log flume ride was not working but we did see this on a sign before we got near the ride. I am not sure if the park list ride closures online and we didn't look in advance but this is always a good idea. The only negative incident involved queue jumping where a small Indian boy blatantly walked under the line on the Arctic Blast ride and went straight to the front. No one seemed to say anything so I shouted up and then more people helped move the child to his large family who to everyone's amazement entered the ride queue and all tried to just keep pushing in front of people. Twice I said something to them and they seemed to think they were not in the wrong. After we had been on the ride I informed a member of staff but we didn't hang around to see what the staff did about it but everyone in the queue was getting very frustrated. I just thought I would mention it because it is always something you should look out for at theme parks! The staff at each ride seemed to be helpful and friendly in general.We returned to the entrance area via the train which had no queue and is also an interesting ride for those who don't want to brave the cable car. We visited the pandas and large aquarium. The Aquarium was excellent and miles better than the one in Singapore. All together it was a great day. The park is very different to any other I have ever visited and we were not sure whether we should really be doing more cultural things rather than visiting a theme park but it was definitely worth it. Thanks!"

I have heard mixed review of HK Ocean Park from friends, family and colleagues, so when I went to HK decided to check it out for myself. Don't be fooled by the name Ocean Park. There are also Panda and other fury creatures on display. Animals that don't immediately remind you of the OCEAN. When we arrived it was pretty crowded with bus loads of tour groups what I observed to be from mainland China. I bought my own SLR camera and was taking photo of the kids and all when a staff member offered to take our photo using my camera and then using her camera. Was wondering why she took our photo with her camera which I later discovered she tried to persuade us to purchase those photo with a paper frame of the Park which I felt was not necessary, since we also got our own camera photos. I know they want to make money, but it would make more sense for those without cameras and would like to have a photo as a sourvenir. The park is generally divided into two areas. The Waterfront being mainy the exhibits showcasing the fishes, the oceanarium (it did not live up to my expectation), the Pandas. i.e. Amazing Asian Animals, Lowland Gardens, Whisker's Harbour, The other area is known as The Summit, its the amusement park area which is accessible via cable car or train. The Summit consisit Marine World, Thrill Mountain, Adventureland and Polar Adventure. We took the cable car, for which we had to queue for 45 minutes. The cable car cabin itself was a bit small for comfort but it'll do and aptly sit three adults, two teens. The cable car ride was a test for the nerve for those not in friendly terms with heights. The view from the cable car was magnificent although the weather was a bit hazy at that time. The ride took about 15 minutes with intermittent stop along the way (for reasons never made known to the cable car passengers). The amusement park area looks dated with rides that do not gives the rider much confidence. We tried most of the rides. The rides were pretty much the same with the ones that can be found at Singapore RWS Universal Studios or Malaysia Genting Highlands. There's a Water show - Ocean Theater where dolphins and sea Lions perform tricks etc. What I like best: The amusement rides, the great view from the cable car ride, cool weatherWhat I like the least: The crowd, long queues, Non-existence of Halal Food outlet. What to wear, depending on the weather, our travel was in Mid Dec 2012, thus loose pants/jeans with T-shirt andn covered shoes/sandals will suffice. Bring a small compact camera will do, instead of those big and heavy DSLR camera.If you are planning a visit, this will definitely be a whole day visit. You can basically cover this whole park within 1 day, provided you start your visit immediately when the park opens. For Muslim travellers, I suggest you have a heavy breakfast and bring packed food to the park and skip the proper lunch and straight head for supper after your trip. Queues for Taxi outside the park is notoriously long. We waited about an hour before we got a cab back to our hotel. There are public buses nearby but you need to ask around to know which bus to take to your preferred designation. If you have children in tow, I suggest taking a cab to prevent the kids from being even more cranky after a full day at the park and to avoid the possibiiity of getting lost when taking the public bus which are full to the brim. Overall this park is good for a one-off visit. Not worth a repeat."

They have 4 roller coasters, the most intense one is the \"hair raiser\" which is probably not that intense if you compare to major theme parks in US/Japan. Also a lot of children-friendly rides as well as many animal exhibits. I would recommend starting as early as possible because in the afternoon from about 2pm onwards, large buses full of tourists from mainland China start to come in and it makes the park much more crowded and the lines get much longer.

To save time and maximize our experienced at the park, we used the train/tram to get to the uphill park and the cable car to get back to the downhill park (where the park entrance located). We only spent about 4 hrs in the park due to weather conditions and decided to visit the Victoria Peak later at the evening. There is no Halal Restaurant in the park but noticed there is a vegetarian restaurant in the park map (located next to cable car station at the uphill park). The restaurant was so congested, crowded with people when we get there so we decided to head back to the downhill park. We got our light meal at the bakery shop near the park entrance (we bought vege. sandwich, salads n croissant with hot drinks). So we suggest that for Muslims, do pack some snacks for your kids and for your own. Getting from one place to the other is quit a distance .. n the kids complained their feet hurts. At this point, the stroller becomes your life saver.There is a stroller rental service in the park just like the one in Disneyland and they also provide storage facility. Both located near the park entrance. We advice family with young kids, skip the ocean park.. it just not worth it. Maybe sightseeing with the HK tram will be more enjoyable for your little ones n less stressful for yourself."

I believe one day is enough to visit this park but I wanted another day as we did not manage to visit everything because we stopped to take pictures every few minutes. This is more sort of a zoo than a theme park, we saw many animals that we had never seen before such as pandas, dolphins, penguins and others which you can see for your self and be surprised. I just hope they are taking care of those animals. Anyways other than that we truly enjoyed the show on the fountains at night and all the games that we went on. Loved it will try to go back again if possible"

Look for the exit to Lippo Center then catch the 629 bus to OP. We bought our tickets from China Travel Service at the airport. (Located after customs declaration. Stall # 4 ; left of McDonald\u2019s) Adult ticket from CTS is HKD 240 and child is HKD 120. CTS only accepts cash. Vouchers were issued by CTS that needed to be exchanged into park tickets at the entrance. There was no line when I went to have the vouchers exchanged. Bags will be checked before you enter but they were not very strict about bringing in food or drinks. We brought along with us some light snacks (chips and cookies) and bottled water without any problem.We were at the park as soon as the park opened (9:30AM during our time of visit - December 28, Friday). We went in the Grand Aquarium (which to me, was the highlight of the park) and the Panda Village first and there were only a few visitors. We did the shows in the Waterfront next from the Amazing Bird Theatre and the Whiskers Theatre. The bird show was just ok- bordering on boring. Mainly in Cantonese but the host/trainer did a little English translation. We did the Sealion show next which was a better. It was translated in English but then the show would not need any heavy translation for you to enjoy it. We had lunch after the Sealion Show and waited for the Whiskers and friends show in the same theatre. We were very disappointed as the whole show was in Cantonese. It was supposed to be a fun and interactive show for little children but we could not understand anything so we left a few minutes into the show along with other park visitors who do not speak Cantonese. I am not sure if there are separate schedules for an English show but I did not notice it on the show schedule hand out.After we were done in Waterfront (early afternoon), we tried to get on the cable car but the line was too long so we crossed to the Summit using the Ocean Express. We went through the Expedition Trail and headed towards the show in Ocean Theatre to watch the show - Sea Dreams. I was surprised to find the show quite boring. I've been to Ocean Park before and I did not remember the main show to be boring. The show revolves around the story of a little girl and her Yeye (grandfather) who dreamt about humans and animals living in harmony. People were leaving in the middle of the show. My kids were nudging us to get up and leave but I asked them to wait thinking the show might climax later... it didn\u2019t. I was fighting to keep my eyes open during the show. The kids liked the North and South pole encounter with all the penguins and sea lions to watch. It was a bit crowded already but still manageable as there were no lines to get in. A lot of thrill rides here in Summit. Rides older kids and teens will surely enjoy. My boys were not interested in the rides. We did want to try the Rapids but had second thoughts because we did not want to get wet. By the time we wanted to exit the park, the lines going back in the Cable Car were even longer that they had to turn away people from getting on. We were forced to ride the Ocean Express again back which also had hoards of people waiting to get on. The lines were long but it moved quickly anyway. If I could do it differently, I would try going up to the Summit as soon as the park opens via Cable Car next time and start my day at OP there. Maybe that way I will go against the crowd and will go back to the Waterfront before everyone else wants to start leaving the Summit. I would give the other shows a miss and probably watch the sea lion and the main show - Sea Dreams (even if it was boring for me and only because it is the main show in OP) or take the other shows as my last priority."

No regrets of picking Ocean Park!It's just another amusement theme park like other countries' do have too. However, the cliff side rides and cable car were an exciting ones! Windy and cooling in the afternoon. The rides are so-so, some for the kids and some for the adults too (the extreme one). Food is rather expensive in the theme park (same like any other theme park in the world).A lot of China trips visited the theme park, especially after lunch time. Go there early to enjoy the rides without a lot of crowds from mainland China. They are at times pretty rude (cut the queue, bang into pedestrian just to catch up with the trip leader, push from behind to get into the tram). Just be careful and stay away from them if possible.The dolphin show is amazing! Perfect timing with story line, even the adults are enjoyed too! As usual, the visitors from China seated in front holding a huge umbrella and block those seated behind, beware of it.Overall, if you don't like Disneyland (because it's so small and you find Japan 1 more worth it), Ocean Park is another choice for a local theme park in Hong Kong."

Almost everything in HK is efficient. The tourism industry is certainly well-developed. Pains has been taken to ensure that tourists can get around efficiently. Getting to Ocean Park is good proof of the government\u2019s conscientious effort. At Admiralty MTR Station, visitors can buy entrance tickets to the theme park. That will save you the hassle of queuing at the park itself. Even if you have not bought the tickets, do not fret. There are many counters at the park to ensure you get a ticket quickly. By 10 am, gates are opened and visitors can enter to have fun. There are two main sections in this theme park. The new aqua city is interesting. The aquarium is very nicely done. The home for the famous pandas is lovely. We like the cable car ride and the train that will take visitors to the other section. There is a mock-up of olden days in Hong Kong. Sad to say, the shows are not too fantastic. The management tried to incorporate some values in the shows but unfortunately, they were not done in the most interesting manner. Given such wonderful environment, the shows deserve more attention from the management. Another room for improvement is the array of food available at the park. Somehow the kiosks do not sell a wide array of snacks. I cannot even get milk there. Isn\u2019t the park targeted at kids? Many kids still drink milk, especially when there is no good food available.

There was a exhibit just dedicated to goldfish - I had no idea there were so many varieties. The penguin enclosure was also a liitte out of the ordinary as parts of the floor were transparent so the penguins swam under you. The large walrus was in an enclosure that allowed us to walk under it and stand in glass domes that were placed in the middle of the enclosure. At one stage he lay over the dome and we were able to get up close and personal! My favourite was the jelly fish aquarium. It was very dark, and contained many tanks packed with jelly fish (many of them iridescent). The tanks were illuminated with lights which slowly changed colors. It was amazing and so different to any aquarium I had every seen. Definitely wirth the $280 Hong kong entrance fees."

Warm coats for the Penguin enclosure - that was really cold (near 0 degrees?) and we weren't really prepared for it. Also, watch out for the penguins swimming under your feet. That was a nice touch in enclosure design. ;)2. Get tickets beforehand if you can - we made a last minute decision to go to the park, and the ticket lines were really really long! 3. Bring a poncho or waterproof coat for the log / water rides - the park now has 2 water rides, where you get a bit wet. Particularly in winter, the coats will keep you dry while allowing you to enjoy the ride!4. Young-kid-friendly section - there are rides for younger children at the lower section of the park. The older kids will enjoy the thrilling rides up the hill.5. Take the cable car early - the assistant manning the line told me that the line taking the cable car DOWN the hill starts building up from 3.30pm. That's when the wait grows beyond half an hour. We beat the rush just at about 3pm.6. Prepare transport pickup to avoid end-day taxi line - that was the worst part of our trip there.

Although its concept is inherently different from the major theme parks, the park should continue striving to better itself and remove decorations, shows or infrastructure that looked a tad dated.Some plus points: great Chinese food offerings and excellent goldfish display (my first time)."

A few tips for first timers:1. Arrive when the park opens at 0930 hrs. 2. Head straight to the cable cars to the other side of Ocean Park. The early bird truly catches the worm - you can go for multiple rides on the same attraction before the crowd catches up with you. 3. Give the show at the Ocean Theater a miss, unless you're watching sea lions and dolphins for the first time.4. If you leave when the park closes (or near closing), be prepared for a long wait if you are taking a taxi. A safer bet would be to take the bus."

But you can't overlook the 100,000 mainland tourist (which, in case you don't already know, means 100,000 screaming, pushing, yelling, littering souls). We walked to the Deep Water Bay beach afterwards and sat for several hours to recover our sanity.Easy to get to, and free entrance on birthdays."

On the 1st visit, we covered the kiddy rides, panda, shows, aquarium and cable car as my son was just 3 yrs old. That took us almost a day. On the 2nd visit, we covered the adventure land, mine train, raging river, cable car, ocean express train, panda and the gold fish exhibit. That took us almost a day too ! My son is 7 yrs old now and he could ride most of the rides as he was 1.23m.To maximize our experience and to avoid the rude tourists, we adopted the strategy below as after 2pm, you would see lots of the rude tourists :1) Reached the park at 10am2) Took the cable first3). Experienced multiple rainforest ride, whirly bird and the arctic blast (barely queue 5 mins)4) Took the Ocean Express Train (no queue) and we had the whole cabin to ourselves. The ride was peaceful.5). Lunch at Panda Cafe6). Visited the Panda, Gold Fish Treasures and the Old HK game zone7) Took the cable again (no queue)8). Experienced the Ocean Park Tower, bumper blaster and arctic blast (queue for 15mins)9). Visited Polar Adventure10) Experienced the mine train and raging river (queue for 5 mins)11) Took Ocean express train (met lots of rude tourist who cut queue in front of kids and shoved the kids as well)12) Shopping"

It was a US$10 cab ride from our hotel in Wanchai, about twenty minutes, and after paying the single, very reasonable, entrance fee (less than $50 each as I recall, but check the website) we had access to all attractions and all day to explore. We visited on a weekday in mid-December, so the theme was Christmas and even though it was VERY crowded (everywhere is, unless you are there very early) my wife and I both had fun on the rides and visiting the displays which were all themed to promote Chinese interest and culture - the Yangtse River and its habitat, etc. Lots of environmental protection interest for activist children and lots of fun and learning, too.Would certainly recommend it, but suggest not on a summer weekend unless you REALLY dig crowds!"

Too much talking and commentaries by the hosts ; as if we are on an educational tour. ? we left midway thru the show.  "

We started when the park opened at 10 am and without big breaks and driving an attractions twice , we really had to look to see all what the park offers (and we stayed there for 8 hours). But really impressive are the jellyfish as well as the big reef aquarium. We also had not much waiting time as we started in the morning, going up to the end of the park and went from there down (on average i would say 5 minutes per attraction). Only for the roller coaster \"hairraiser\" we had to wait for 20 minutes, but this was because of driving with it at about 3 pm when more people arrived. In fact: very good, a lot things to do and see (also for grown-ups), we recommend: start at 10 am and immidiately use the cable car to start from above."

Seeing the commitment of the staff as they went about their duties of looking after their charges was heart warming.In general the exhibits were also of a high standard and in good condition. So why only an average rating? In my opinion the park was not really equipped to deal with the large crowds we experienced during our visit. It was a chaotic crush of pushing and elbowing that made me anxious and the flurry of people all trying to see the animals was frenetic and not at all relaxing. The animal shows need a complete overhaul. The shows are outdated and lack any kind of magic or energy. Whilst pushing the conservation message is essential in their presentations, the flow as well as dynamism of showing the animals is completely lost in translation. One message that came through loud and clear in the dolphin show is that dolphins will save humans from drowning which, in my opinion, is not the kind of message that should be broadcast to an easily convinced audience. I have plenty more feedback for Ocean Park and should their management read tripadvisor they are absolutely welcome to make contact with me.There is also plenty of room for improvement with regards to the catering team/food outlets. In general I thought the service was poor and the food was of below average quality. Overall I think that Ocean Park is a top quality facility that is dedicated to animal care and conservation."

A huge theme park with busloads of tourists, literally. Due to the magnitude of the theme park, you probably won't feel the congestion. You only get to 'appreciate' the crowd when you explore popular attractions or take the train/ cable car. Ocean Park puts together a zoo and a theme park. A good concept, I think, especially for families. Young children can enjoy themselves interacting with the animals while the more adventurous can take some of the thrill rides. My family particularly enjoyed the panda enclosure. The 2 pandas were so adorable! Be warned that lines could be long. We waited for about 1 hour to take the cable car down the top of the theme park. Mind you, we were there on a weekday. A good place to consider going, especially you have the extra time. Ps: I noticed they were in the midst of building a MTR station at the entrace of the theme park. Perhaps it might be more convenient for tourists in the future."

It was a wonderful experience for me since I haven't been in an aquarium since I was a kid and I've learnt a lot from the different species of goldfish. The second zone consist of the theme park rides. I highly recommend HairRaiser, the flash and the abyss.

When the car went over the peak and the views of the ocean were suddenly possible, the French girl exclaimed \"oh la la\" and hugged her Daddy. It was more French than watching Amelie whilst eating escargots and drinking wine. I share this because I too felt like an excited 4 year old at times. Go and rediscover your inner child. What a moment!"

The costumes were incredible and the staff was completely in character, scaring people also outside of the haunted houses. The carnival was also tons of fun, with creepy stuffed animals as prizes, and drinks with fruit eyeballs inside. I would recommend getting the more expensive pass so as to skip queues, and catching the side shows outside the haunted houses [Chinese Vampire Clubbing was almost the highlight].The cable car at night is also very, very cool."

It was raining when we reached at 10 am, but there were many animals kept indoor so we spent our time exploring Pandas, Penguins, monkeys etc. And then it was time to enjoy the rides as rains stopped miraculously. The OCean Express (train) was a great ride which took us to another part of OCean P and the rides there were out-of-the-world! Flash, Rev Rooster, Hair Raiser, Whirly Bird were one of the few awesome rides! Food for veg Indians is a problem. There is a Bayview restaurant serving something that was presented as Indian, however, did not look appealing. there are many snack outlets where we get popcorns, softdrinks etc. The fountain show (called Symbio) was spectacular v unique...do not miss it (7 pm)."

Not only do they have great rides that fly out over the water, they also have a wonderful aerial cable car. There are also animal and sea life exhibits. Everything is rather spread out and a day is really not enough time to take it all in. I've been here 2 times and still have not seen it all. The atmospehere is great though, there is something for everyone here. A new additon this year is a section called 'Old Hong Kong' which was really warm and beautiful. The smell of grilled squid being sold from stands thoughout the park is wonderful and you should try some. Ocean Park is easy to get to with public transportation and will be even easier when the new MTR line is completed. Whether you have children or just want to give your inner child a good time, come here, you will not be disappointed. I love this place."

Smooth ticketing process and once inside there was something for all the big kids as well as the little one. Highlight for me was seeing Pandas for the first time. They were especially active whilst we were there so that was a real treat. We pretty much took on nearly every ride with the Rollercoasters being the most fun. Wait times for some rides were up to 45 mins which was a bit frustrating but unavoidable. We actually caught the train up to the top this only had a 5 min wait.Waited and watched the Dolphin show which was very cheesy - probably would give this a miss if I went again.......but good I supose if you have never seen Dolphins.All in all OCean Park was a fun but exhausting day out."

The entry charges are very reasonable for what you get - purchase tickets on the way there at Exchange Square bus station to avoid queues.As another reviewer has mentioned, the only drawback with this attraction are the hordes of over-excited and garrulous trippers from the mainland who push and shove anybody out of their way in their haste to be first. They completely ignore instructions about not using flash cameras to avoid startling the animals and are a thorough nuisance in general. Park staff seem to have given up on any attempt to make them behave to an acceptable standard.The park and toilet facilities are kept spotlessly clean by a small army of cleaners and gardeners."

One was sleeping but the other was having a tea of bamboo shots and was absolutely beautiful. The park is fabulous the environments they are created for all the animals are amazing problably the best I have ever seen in the world and the giant aquariam litereally takes your breath away it is absolutely fantastic, I would have stayed under the main dome all day watching the hammerhead, rays, turtles and fish crusing by.

Some rides involved water, so they were great to do once you started feeling the heat. We arrived just before opening time and were second in line in one of the queues.

Takes about 20 minutes, and costs HK$ 10.80 Standard entrance to park is HK$ 280 and gives excellent value for a busy and tiring day's entertainment. The park is divided into two sections. The lower part has all the animals, including two very active pandas, a huge aquarium, a sturgeon features, crocodiles, goldfish and more. Also a large kiddy playground and little rides. There are two ways of getting to the upper level - by cable car (great views), or an express train, which is described as a wonderful experience, but it is really just a moving train in a tunnel.The upper part of the park has several different sections, with lots of daredevil rides. Not for the weak of tummy ! Two things to be aware of with Ocean Park. First, it is very big, very spread out, and extremely hilly, so prepare to be exhausted. Second, the food caters for Chinese tastes, but definitely not Western palatte. Lots of noodles, chicken feet, dumplings etc, but none of the traditional fast food you may associate with places like Disney.There are the usual rip-off tourist traps for souveniers - best avoided. The park is spotlessly clean, including toilets. Young children may be excluded from many of the rides, either due to height restrictions, or just because they are too scary. Elderly or disabled visitors will find this tough going. Get there very early (ready for opening at 10 am), and be prepared for very long waits at the cable cars as the day goes on. Well worth a visit, with enough to keep you occupied for at least a full day, if you have the stamina."

It was amazing, there are so many creatures to see. At the end there is a HUGE tank with a really amazingly thick glass or perspex viewing wall. It was between 2 and 3 stories high.2) the Pandas.

The place has certainly changed.You have two main sections the \"Waterfront\" which is located as you enter the Park. And \"The Summit\" located on top of a nearby hill. You can get from one to the other, either by cable car that goes over the hills, or by a train, that cuts through a mountain. The views from the cable car are fantastic.We caught the cable car to the Summit as we wanted to go to the ocean theatre show. It was nice, but not spectacular. Speaker system here was terrible.Going to the ocean theatre was fine, as it was downhill all the way. But coming back up from it was quite steep. Not good for my bad back, in fact my back got so bad, that we had to leave early. The whole summit area is very hilly. Walking can be hard work, as you are constantly going either downhill or uphill.Maps are provided free as you purchase your ticket. But I suggest you download a map and study it before you go, so you arnt going over the same territory all the time.We had a quick look around the summit area, but decided to go back to the Waterfront area as its not as hilly.Loved the panda enclosure. Nice big clear viewing areas. But got annoyed by people pushing and cutting in front of you as i was waiting for the right photo.I must admit the mainland chinese are very good at cutting in at queues, and they dont seem to have a problem with your photo blurring as they push in. Thats not the parks fault, but stand your ground, and dont allow it to happen.Walked around the \"waterfront area\" as there are many displays to keep you occupied for hours.Beware of all the official photographers all over the place. We just kept saying no thankyou and they would go away.I could have spent the whole day here, as there is so much to do. Recommended for any age group.Its wheelchair friendly as not many stairs, mainly ramps, but the Summit area would be hard work for the person pushing the wheelchair.I also saw them stop the cable car for an elderly couple who were a bit slow to move, to get on. Thought this was very considerate of the Park to do this."

The dolphin experience well worth the extra money. The only negative to our day (but a big negative) was the unbelievable queue for the bus or taxi to get home. The queue was atleast 3 hours long, people jumping into the line, and about 1 taxi every 10 minutes. Ridiculous. I WOULD NOT RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT (BUS) OR TAXIs at the end of the day. I think they are building a train stop.We got there early (10am) before the crowds arrived at about 3pm. Well worth it - we didn't have to queue for anything. Worth noting that the food options on the rides side of the mountain are pretty average. Not many shady places to sit."

The ocean threatre show is below expectation, we were standing behind the seats on the top as there were full of tourist from China, very squeezy and hot. The speaker system is not good, unable to hear clearly.You could expect alot of chinese tourists who are being rude and cutting the Q. Be prepare!

I quite enjoyed the aquarim and the pandas, actually the whole Waterfront part was a very nice experience. But the reason I went there is for the rides and that was where it became quite the opposite of amazing. Being 179cm tall and having curves taught me an alltogether different walk of shame at this park. The Dragon and the Abyss I had no problems getting into, but as soon as we reached the newer rides, well simply put my hips didn't agree with the seat at the Hair Raiser, and then my bosom was too large to fully close the safety thing at the Flash. Didn't really want to try any other rides after that. And I thought it was ridiculous - not in any single amusement park in all the places around the world that I've been did something like that happen to me, never. I haven't even given a thought that something like this might happen when I decided to spend my day here. But it would be an amazing place to go with children. Shame that the rides didn't take into consideration, that not all the people from around the world are petite..."

The park was good, but we found that it was not laid out very well, and was so hilly and we seemed to be walking for so long to get to places. The reason for the visit was basically to see the Panda Bears and that did not disappoint. We only went on a couple of rides as we don\u2019t like the spinning rides or a lot of the rollercoaster type rides, so only went on a couple of water rides which were at different parts of the park, viewed the jellyfish exhibition, aquarium, saw the pandas, did the train and sky rail. The one thing that did annoy us was that everywhere we went they wanted to take our photo and then want us to buy, we ended up just walking straight past them when we entered anyway, just found that it got bit much, can understand at the beginning of the park but not at nearly every entry place. They gave my youngest (6yrs) on a couple of occasions a snow globe with his face on it and said look you can take this home, then we had to explain to him that we had to buy it and if it had all of us on it then we probably would have."

We started early and visited the huge aquarium, then caught an acrobat show before moving on to see a bird show and a seal show, rides for young kids and a beautiful goldfish aquarium with some very exotic species.All the was before we got to a diorama of old Hong Kong where we took some pictures and ate some (mediocre) street food. We then took a thrilling cable car ride to the top of the hill enjoying spectacular views along the way.The top of the hill is where there are even more rides, including roller coasters, a log ride on water and more. In the evening we took the cable car back down and found a good spot to see the water and pyrotechnic show.Ocean Park really is a great day out. Just note that if you are going with kids 5 and younger, many rides will be off limits. There's still plenty of animals to see and rides for them to enjoy, but if you're a parent who enjoys thrill rides, you may have to take turns while your partner watches the kids."

These exhibits allow close up views and photo opportunities of various Polar animals are stunning. The Asian animals exhibit housed 2 Pandas which are a stunning.. The ocean aquarium is huge and houses some stunning fish from around Asia.The day previous we had visited Disneyland .... Ocean Park for us was much better experience with minimal queues, food and snacks at reasonable prices, and a greater selection of rides and attractions than Disneyland.

Took the 629 bus from Admiralty MTR outside Lippo towers.Probably got here too early but did not have to contend with the hordes of tourists who arrived later. If I could do it again, I would:1. Still Arrive early.2. Go to the Grand Aquarium - spend 1/2 hour - preferably in silence.3. Head to the Summit via cable car - snag your own and enjoy the views.4. Polar encounters - seals, a lonely walrus, penguins. Nice to see them when there aren't too many people around.5. Jelly fish.6. Rides - I did: Hair raiser, The Dragon, The Mines, Raging River. Would do these again and work up the courage to try the other rides. These rides have the unexpected side effect of helping you to stop thinking about work. Highly recommended.7. Ocean Park Tower - great 360deg views.8. Visit the attractions I missed - Pacific Pier and Atoll Reef. Would give the sturgeons a miss. 9. Head back down to the waterfront and see the Pandas! There are 2 enclosures which are both tightly patrolled to ensure the tourists don't make such a ruckus - bonus for me. Amazing Asian Adventures is where the younger 2 pandas live - they are pretty young and active. I watched them for about 45 minutes. They must not get too much nutrition from the bamboo because that is almost all they do - eat. There were red pandas too but these were very shy and I only got a brief glimpse of one. They looked very cute too. In the Hong Kong Jockey club sponsored panda enclosure were the 2 older pandas - one of these seemed to be asleep for most of the day. The other, well he looked just sad. Don't know what the baseline respiratory rate is for these animals but he looked like he was short of breath.10. The goldfish - well only if you want to \"marvel\" at how these fish have been selectively bred for their ridiculous features - we don't need genetic engineering of the future to see how badly it can turn out!11. Go back to the Grand Aquarium but there will probably be hordes of noisy, rude tourists by now.12. Give the shows a miss - they are not great. The food didn't look good so I had Mcdonalds - which was more expensive than downtown. The park is not very well signposted but the unexpected benefit is a good workout. The latter 3 reasons are why this attraction is 4 stars and not 5. Overall, highly recommend - even for people without kids and traveling alone! Also great value for money. Definitely do this if you don't want yet another day of shopping. It is much much better than Disneyland."

The gardens are gone, there is incessant loud pop music played through speakers along the paths, and every attraction has 'exit through the shop'. The animals are still there and the aquarium is even larger, but they are a mere sideshow for the people who are attracted by all the 'thrill rides'.

One of my children could go on a number of rides but maybe only about 25% of the rides, my youngest child being approx. 1m tall could go on very little and it only really left the baby rides.This is a place for children who I reckon are from about 7-13 as they will be able to go on a lot of the rides \u2013 you have to be at least 1.3m for most of the rides and a number as I recall were higher than this.My first issue was with the signposting \u2013 sure they exist but could be better\u2026 I felt like we did a bit of needless walking about at times and with 2 kids it was tiring, especially down to the Pirate ship area as most of the rides we couldn\u2019t get on with my 6 year old anyway!Make sure you go straight for the cable car, later in the morning and into the afternoon the queues are simply horrendousFood choices are poor, food is just crap, no decent choices or even half decent choices for a Western familyAquarium was rubbish \u2013 I was disappointed at this especially having recently been to Cape Towns aquariumPanda enclosure was good (though not for the animals \u2013 I bet its too small for them \u2013 in a sealed environment)My biggest issue was with the quantity of people, especially from early afternoon, it was like the hordes of Babylon had descended on the place with what must have been 100\u2019s of coach parties and a lot of older people. I have nothing against older people its just what were they doing in a resort that is really for children \u2013 this is not a place for adults only\u2026 just don\u2019t even think about this place if you don\u2019t have kids around 7-13\u2026 you will feel a complete muppet for coming here\u2026 so older people don\u2019t come to a place for kids! \u2013 I felt like the entire population of Southern China was at the resort the afternoon we were there\u2026 yep it was shoulder to shoulder in virtually the entire resort!Back to the quantity of people \u2013 I felt like an extra in a stampede \u2013 so many people getting on train to go back down from the cable car/larger rides section it was just awful. We had tried to come back by the cable car but the queue was at leas an hour long so that was a \u2018no-go\u2019 \u2013 it was hellish\u2026.Being in Asia you find that people have absolutely no manners at all \u2013 and push in on queues and don\u2019t care about anyone\u2019s personal space (I half expected someone to clear their throat for good measure also at times!). I found my self widening myself most of the time to stop people walking into our children, to stop them being walked into\u2026 people here don\u2019t care, they are so rudeAnd then we found people taking pictures of our kids \u2013 I have no idea what that was about \u2013 We had to kindly ask someone to stop taking pictures of my boy \u2013 it was just bizarre, it was definitely a WTF moment.. though this has nothing to do with the resort, just indicates there were quite a few weirdo\u2019s at the place.. all on coach parties by the looks of it from Southern China.The biggest highlight was leaving \u2013 never to return again\u2026"

Adventurous rides for the dare-devils, log-flumes and the animal exhibits for the less adventurous! The park has a worthy environmental message running throughout and views to die for from the revolving view platform.I loved the way all animals have really suitable enclosures. The penguins, seals and walrus have deep water pools, the pandas have extensive grassed enclosures.This was an excellent day out with plenty to do and tons to see. I recommend it whole-heartedly."

            "review": "Amusement park with rides and animals: worth it!. I have been to this park many times but it is always changing and adding new things to make it better and bigger.It is located on a mountain and you can get there easily by bus from Admiralty. There is a direct bus and you can even buy tickets to the park there or in any 7/11 store in Hong Kong to avoid the queues at the main entrance. Or you can buy it online (www.oceanpark.com.hk/html/en/home/).Entry ticket prices are reasonable as it includes all the rides (HK280 for adults and HK140 for kids).If you want to enjoy all the park has to offer is better to plan a full day for it. Do go early and preferably on a week day as you will have almost no queues for the rides and attractions. It is better to get out a little bit before it closes or it will get too crowded and it won\u2019t be easy to take a bus or catch a taxi.There are not too many indoor activities so it is better to avoid very hot and sunny days.Wear comfortable shoes as you will walk a lot.Take a map and a show schedule at the entrance and plan what you want to see on one side and then on the other side of the park.Usually the cable car has a long queue and I would recommend going there first. The views from the cable car are amazing. It will go up the mountain and take you to the other side of that mountain and you will have stunning views of the harbor. It is quite tall and if you do not like highs you can always take the underground train. If the cable car is too crowded this train is much faster also.This park is good for small kids, big kids and adults as it has different kinds of attractions and rides.My daughter is 7 years old and loved the merry go round, the frog hopper, the playground and the talking tree that teaches kids to recycle as well as the whiskers show, the dolphin show, the pandas, penguins and walrus. She also liked the mascot meet and greet and enjoyed taking photos with them.My son is a little older (10 years) and enjoyed the whiskers show, the dolphin show, the pandas, penguins and walrus and the Rapids, a water ride.For more adventurers (kids or adults) there are roller coaster rides like train mine, artic blast, and hair raiser as well as raging river. On the water rides you will get wet, maybe even soaked.There are 2 panda exhibition halls. The one nearest to the aquarium is always crowded and have long queues. It is small and doesn\u2019t have much space, reminds me of a corridor. The new hall (Giant Panda Adventure), almost opposite to the underground train station, is much nicer and usually doesn\u2019t have so many people. The environment is much better and it looks more like a natural environment. They have red pandas in this hall also.The aquarium is nice and has a lot of fishes and an area where you can touch some of them. The park has a program for the kids to learn about sea life and to protect the species and even spend the night in the aquarium. My son did it with his school and loved it!The polar adventure area was new to us and very, very nice but quite cold (bring a coat!). The penguin hall was nice and kids and adults enjoyed it. There is also walrus, and artic fox den (the entry for this one is not easy to find as it is on the exit of a gift shop. Do look for it as the artic fox is really cute).The dolphin show isn\u2019t what it used to be when they had the killer whale, long time ago, but they do tell a nice story and try to make people aware that we should all protect the animals.It also has sea lions doing some tricks as well as the dolphins jumping around. And for an extra price you can meet a dolphin.Nearby, there is a pier with seals that is very nice. You can see the seals outside the water and even feed them for a fee, and then you can go down and see the seals swimming under water.The final show in the main fountain with 3D effects is very nice and worth seeing.We went to the park for 2 days in the end of September/beginning of October and there were a lot of Halloween decorations around the park but they had a different ticket for the Halloween party at night time, which we didn\u2019t try.Water inside the park is quite expensive and I remember paying HK20 for a 300 ml bottle. I had bought some in 7/11 and it was only HK5, but it was hot and it finished fast. Do bring water and some snacks, especially for the kids.Food prices in food stalls are reasonable but it is fast food. There is a restaurant in the Grand Aquarium that we didn\u2019t try and the Tuxedos restaurant, which is very nice. It has a large glass to the penguins and you can watch the penguins as you have lunch. It had a long queue and we waited around half an hour but it was a nice environment inside. Prices are a little bit higher than in the food stalls but I found it reasonable for Hong Kong standards. Do bring a coat as it is quite cold in the restaurant."

            "review": "One of the best things to do in Hong Kong!. As an expat living in Hong Kong, we continually have visitors and I always take them to Ocean Park, it is my favorite things to do. Ocean Park isn't just for kids, it is for kids and adults alike. There are great animal exhibits, it seems like they are opening new ones every few months and there are fabulous roller coaster rides and also tamer rides. In my opinion, if you just go to visit the Panda exhibit it is well worth the price of the ticket.A few suggestions to ease your visit, buy your tickets ahead of time on line, at least the day before. You can pick them up beginning at 9:30 am. Pick them up and get ready to go in as soon as the gates open at 10 am, sometimes they open a little early. The first stop should be the Panda exhibit (check out the park map to acquaint yourself with where they are located). For some reason, most of the visitors don't go there until a little later on and you can normally find yourself in the exhibit without a whole lot of people around. Also, they are fairly active in the morning eating their bamboo and wandering around their enclosures. We have been lucky enough to see them splashing in their stream, it was pretty incredible. Photo opportunities abound in the early morning. After you leave the Panda exhibit make sure you take a few minutes to watch the otters, they are always very active and it's on your way out of Panda area.My next stop would be to either ride the cable car over mountain (this is a beautiful view and great photos) to the other side or ride the new underground tunnel...both are a must, we typically take the train over and cable car back at the end of the day. If you like to ride rides, the new roller coasters are a lot of fun. The lines typically aren't too long first thing in the morning and you can get a lot of rides under your belt. After you are finished riding rides, the new penguin exhibit is great and also the new aquarium. All the exhibits are good, but those are my favorites.Ocean Park is a great way to spend a half day or full day, depending on how much time you have to spare on a visit to Hong Kong. The park is normally in full swing (very crowded) by about 1 pm, when the tour buses arrive in full force. We typically go first thing and leave by about 1 or 2 pm and head to Stanley Market for a nice peaceful lunch somewhere on the board walk!Ocean Park isn't Sea World, but it is a fabulous place to spend a day and Sea World doesn't have Pandas! Go check it out and enjoy!"

We rode back in this and was very quick. There are a number of fun rides for adults and kids and we didn't have to queue for any of them for longer than 20 minutes, but most just needed a 5 minute wait.

Unfortunately the panda enclosure is fairly small and visitors are ushered through in an almost conveyor belt type fashion meaning it is both crowded and very difficult to stop and take photos. That said we were unprepared for the rest of the Park and the huge range of attractions on offer. I was there with my 7 year old for which there were more than enough rides to keep her occupied all day. But at the same time teenagers are just as well catered for with an abundance of thrill rides. The Park has recently opened a new Penguin attraction which was great, although do be prepared and take a jumper with you as the penguin enclosure is kept at a much lower temperature to the 30 degrees + outside! One of the Park's highlights for us was the cable car ride which links the two distinct areas of the Park - the views are amazing. I personally felt places to eat were limited and were typical of an amusement park as in primarily fast food. Ocean Park is not, in my opinion, a patch on Disney, however as a family friendly day out in Hong Kong it is hard to beat."

            "review": "If You have to Choose, I Suggest You Think Twice before Going to Disneyland. First up, I confess, I have never been to Disneyland. Any of them. The reason is simple: I cannot think of a more horrid way to blow my bucks than drowning in a sickly sweet milkshake of something that doesn't have milk in it.Fortunately, two years ago, whilst staying with some Hong Kong local friends of mine, we took up their advice and took our late teen kids to Ocean Park.What a truly fabulous place.Accesibility is most straight forward by bus. Through the Aberdeen tunnel and you are there. Hong Kong has a fantastic public transport system; it is a consequence of necessity, but it is really good. You must get an Octopus Card. That means one for everyone, a separate one for everyone, children included.Entry is most reasonably priced; don't try to skimp; the park is many rolled into one, and with enthusiastic kids, could occupy two days. Others have noted there is not much hotel accommodation nearby, but it does not matter: if you are staying on The Island, you can be quickly at Ocean Park via the excellent public transport system.Ocean Park is a zoo, amusement park, aquarium, 'seaworld', and nature reserve (Honk Hong style) of the highest standard. The cable-car rides to and from the major areas of the park are worthy tourist attractions in their own rights. We spent one day at Ocean Park. The entire site was clean and extremely well cared for. The Amusement Park rides interlace the enormous headland aside Aberdeen Harbour. There are therefore some stairways to negoiate, but nothing I would consider strenuous. As you walk between attractions, you will enjoy pathways bordered by well-kept and charming gardens. Food onsite, is, as expected.Towards the 'bottom' of the Park is the aquarium and 'Seaworld'. Both are excellent. be mindful of the showtimes for the 'Seaworld'. It would be a great shame to miss an excellent show. Now, having said so many positive things, I will also tell you we went to Ocean Park in midweek, during October, a sort of nothing time. But, it was so nothing that the 'kids' ran off the end of their favourite roller-coaster and straight back onto it. No-one else was there. I hestitate to hope you may enjoy such fortune, but I believe the mid-week option is good. Enjoy. Please note: the web site does not allow me to select a review date earlier than Nov, 2011. We visited Ocean Park in Oct 2010, and as I have been to Hong Kong 20 times+ since with work, and have a number of friends living there, I think you will find my review relevant.When in Hong Kong, do, with or without kids, take a day to visit Ocean Park."

The entry price is an absolute bargain for the amount of activities and visual delights that you will experence while you are there. Allow a while day and night is our tip. If you have young children there is a whole section dedicated to them - rides, games, palyground and activites. The animals they have on showcase here are so varied from an array of gold fish, parrots. panda bears, reptiles, they amount we saw was really surprising. The sky rail is breathtaking and the rides on the upper part provide adults with their fun. The aquarium was amazing and a little tip from us, stay after the night show and have dinner in the restaurant. The place is basically deserted and you have dinner with floor to ceiling aquarium views, dining as the turtles, sharkes, manta rays and fish swim on past to stay hello. That is our other tip, you must definatly stay for the evening show. Such a production - world class!"

Hope the MTR will be completed soon, so the current bus service doesnt seem adequate to serve the crowd.Must visits are the panda enclosures, new aquarium, north & south pole enclosures.Nostalgic HK street, bakery & eateries are quite disappointing though. Limited food choices at the old HK street do not appeal to the crowd. Bakery could be more creative, eg: have waffles, buns in turtle or squid shapes (ocean world theme). Most eateries close at 5pm, this is too early, considering that visitors stay behind for the light show at 7pm"

We really enjoyed seeing the Pandas, both the black and white and the red pandas. It was such a treat to see them so close up. We weren't able to ride too many attractions as the park is very spread out over the mountain. We had to take either the skyway, submarine trolley and many escalators to get from one level to another and being that it was our first time, we weren't able to plan our visit very well. Besides, it was summer and very crowded! Not too many shady and cool areas to hang out and rest. It can get very stifling in some areas of the park without any breeze. I'm not sure I would ride on any of the \"E-ticket\" rides as many are positioned right near the edge of the mountain. I'm sure they are safe since there's been many before me but I'll keep my feet on the floor! It was a nice combination of rides and exhibits."

Once you enter ocean park, you should choose either go for rides first or go for aquarium and shows. For these, do check out the shows time (panda feeding, dolphin, seal etc). between the time, instead of relaxing doing nothing, do get on the rides. my only regret is that i couldnt try the whole rides T.T... The foods are expensive, in case you r on budget, bring food and water for your brunch, lunch, dinner..it saves a lot..when i came, it was raining..so remember your raincoat or umbrella!!"

So of course we did so.Friendly word of advice - make sure that the day you visit Ocean Park is not a public holiday in HK or China. We made the unfortunate choice of visiting Ocean Park on the Mid-Autumn holidays and we were overwhelming by the deluge of mainlanders. This had a flow on effect as all the rides had a wait time of in excess of an hour. At the end of the day, we manage to have 1 go on the bumper blasters (bumper cars), space wheel, the rapids and the cable cars.The space wheel had no wait time probably due to the fact that it was located in a isolated part of the park. I had wasted 2 hours waiting in line for the Hair Raiser but gave up considering that snail pace that it was moving it plus my 7 year old was gettting hungry.Also bear in mind that as Ocean Park is build around a hillside, there is some degree of climbing and walking to do. Escalators are present but will not get you from point A to point B totally. Bus service from Admiralty to Ocean Park was easy and directions were available. Probably will visit on the next trip if it happens but remember, not on a gazetted PUBLIC HOLIDAY!"

So he googled it, got interested, and we went and had so much fun. Unfortunately we were told to go to Central and we needed to get to Admiralty, so wasted valuable time going the extra MTR, we didn't actually get there till 1pm, which turned out to be far too late. We had to go quickly to see all that we wanted to and ended up missing the penguins, three of the rides and most of the laser, fire and fireworks display at the end.Best parts of the day were the pandas, the wonderful growly walrus (I've never seen one before and he kept us spellbound watching him swim, lunge himself out of the water and roar, very cool) the house of jellyfish, wow! and the bird show was a clever surprise.Worst part was at the end of a very hot day waiting an hour for the gondola only to find that groups of one or two were having a whole gondola to themselves when they hold seven people. The queue could have moved twice as quickly if they had organised people to share. That was maddening actually, as parents were carrying sleeping children, old people were standing the whole time and it could have been avoided. Plus we could have all made it on time to see the light show finale."

It was very easy to get to, caught the MTR to Admiralty and then one of many buses which took us straight to Ocean Park. Once we arrived, we went to the Aquarium which was extremely overcrowded and very difficult for the kids to see the tanks due to being pushed out of the way all the time. Unfortunately, the cable cars were not working whilst we were there which was a huge dissapointment as this is obviously one of the main attractions of the park. The only way to the other side of the mountain was by the train which again was extremely overcrowded. As the Park is spread out over both sides of the mountain, during such hot weather was a real effort to get young kids easily around the park. There was an area for younger children which was quite good, however, we felt that this park really catered for teens. Don't bother taking prams or strollers there as to get up and down the mountain, to and from the different areas, is quite a task, particularly in hot weather. We had been to Disneyland earlier in the week and Ocean Park did not compare in the slightest. Ocean Park is old and in need of a refurbishment and the park attendants and amenities are few and far between. We did not come across any drink stations and at every attraction you were pulled aside to be photographed and then hassled to buy it. We felt it was overpriced and belive that we would have had a more enjoyable time spending a second day at Disneyland."

We took the MTR to Admiralty and whist leaving the station we spotted a shop selling tickets which were much cheaper than the at park tickets. We then left the station and joined what looked like a massive queue for the buses but there were many buses and within about 10mins we were on the bus; remember to have your octopus card out as you have to swipe your pass before you get on. After a short journey we were at Ocean Park, as we had our ticket already we just joined the queue to have our bags searched. Do remember to bring in a bottle for water with you because it is 20HKD in the park.The park is very big and I have heard that it looks dated but we did not see any signs of this and thought it was well looked after and nice and clean. There are lots of different areas and unless you go early you will struggle to do/see it all in a day. There are not many shaded areas in the park, so a tip is keep popping in to see the penguins as you get cooled down lovely. We really wanted to see the Panda\u2019s while we were in Hong Kong and we were not disappointed as there are four to see, and they are FAB, I could have stayed watching then all day. Don\u2019t forget to go on the cable cars they give a great view of the park. There are lots and lots of rides for all ages with a few that you need to go on with an empty stomach! Most of the rides have little storage boxes for your camera\u2019s etc which is a really good idea, and before you get on some of the rides you are given a little basket to put our items in.I couldn\u2019t say which park was better out of Ocean Park or Disneyland as they are both good for different reasons."

Get on the bus that takes you direct to ocean park.5. You use one of the tickets you've been given to the park and one for the journey back.6. When you leave - join the queue for the buses to take you back.When you get to the queue, don't be dismayed by it's length - we left when the park closed and the queue was a mile long. Then a bunch of buses arrived, the queue evaporated and we was on a bus with less than a 10 minute wait.Astonishing.Ocean Park is so-so. Just some fun.We went on a Tuesday - and there were a number of rides closed when we was there - one of the was the chair-lift which really disappointed us.We reckon Ocean Park and Disney are nothing like each other so I wouldn't bother about comparing. Also - I don't think you'd want to do more than 1 day at Ocean Park. We were pretty casual and I don't think we missed anything - though we did get there when the park opened and left when it closed.Our longest wait, about 30 minutes, was for the roller-coaster but we think it was worth it.The other rides are fun and we didn't have to wait long.Just go and have fun."

We all had a great experience despite rushing in order to be able to do what we planned to see and do in the great pleasure of our kids and ourselves. Be purchased the ticket online groupons and manged to save about 300 yuan overall. We saw the pandas (not too active mostly sleeping) dolphins (great show) sharks,crocodile,monkeys, penguins... Cable car is a great experience and the view was splendid, the girls loved it and give you some time to enjoy the quiet time and the view.Better buy some drinks before arrival, food is overall over pricey, you need to look around if you want to find affordable prices.The 2 negatives points were the fact our kids were too small and limited to most of the attractions and the limited time, better be there at the opening with your tickets already purchased to save time.There is a kids corner with some attractions for young kids where they could have a good time before heading anywhere else, it is a good start after the visit of the Grand Aquarium, Sichuan treasures(Pandas) and Giant Pandas adventures (Pandas) 2 different places to see the Pandas...then the cable car to take you to another part of the park for more attractions. (you can take the Ocean express Train but nothing to see and very quick compared to the Cable car's view..."

It used to be the biggest in Hong Kong until Disney arrived, so I think if you have children you'll be here for a whole day. Our main goal at Ocean Park was to see the panda exhibits and fortunately these are very close to the entrance and don't require taking the cable car to the top area of the park.As mentioned in other reviews, get here early if you want to avoid queues. We got there around 11:00, and queued for about 20 minutes to get tickets, so not too bad, but this was off-peak season.The panda exhibits are excellent. They have about 6 giant pandas and if you get there during feeding time (around 11:00) you get a great view of these amazing animals. In addition to the giant pandas they also have two red pandas - look them up now - these guys are amazing.Once we'd finished with the pandas we were going to check out the aquarium but there was a 45 minute wait so we ended up leaving instead. A great few hours out if you don't have kids and just want the chance to see live pandas.I must mention that you might be suggested to get a bus to the park, I would say that's not worth it. We took a taxi from Kowloon all the way there and it cost us around HKD 50."

Mostly mainland Chinese tourists. I last visited the park more than 15 years ago. Much have changed. They added new attractions and up graded some rides. The park is divided into 2 sections. There is the entrance on the lower part if the hill. There you can visit the aquarium, they show case all kinds of ocean creatures. Then there is the sichuan treasures, birds, pandas and a place where little kids could ride and play. Try to catch the shows where you can learn about the animals. Very educational for the family. The cable car was down for repair, so we took the ocean express, a monorail with an underwater submarine theme to the upper hill side. There were more attractions here. A must visit to the polar expedition, rainforest, jellyfish and watch the show at the ocean theatre of dolphins and sealions. There are some rides thrills for adults and children as well. Lots of walking up and down the hills. The view is Specatular. Just imagine riding on the roller coaster by the edge of the cliff overlooking the ocean. Scary and thrilling indeed! We caught some cheap tickets from a local travel agency and catch the bus from admiralty mtr station. The city bus takes you directly there. Just make sure you have an octopus card with you. It is a theme park, zoo and rides. Something for everyone. Educational and fun to be there. Glad to visit if you are in hong kong. Affordable compared to Disneyland."

The park was clean, tidy, but extremely crowdy. We were not interested in any of the thrill rides, so, we ignored the roller-coasters and high nauseatic games. The cable car and the observatory tower were our favourite. Then, the animals. The exhibits for animals were clean, well landscaped, and well managed. Animals were given enough rooms to move around as well. We liked the Pandas and the Seals the most.I have to agree that the food in the park was very expensive. But we took it as the price to pay in the theme park. To reach the park, we need to take either taxi or bus, not very convenient comparatively, to the transportation to HK Disneyland. It was extremely crowdy during our visit (middle of May), and it was extremely warm. The time passed extremely slow during the queueing time. Umbrella might be helpful to deter blazzing sunlight and sudden rainfall. I shared more about our experience at our blog- bettyandlingshing.blogspot.com/2012/06/hong-kong-ocean-park-and-repulse-bay.html. I would give 4 stars to the park, for all the conservation efforts and the happy animals inside the park. Must visit? Yes."

We were dissaponted in the options for smaller children, but noticed that most other visitors were much older adults which may explain the lack of rides for younger kids.Overall it was ok, but I Would recommend Disneyland Hong Kong over this park - especially if you ave smaller kids."

Don't be expecting Alton towers or six flags standards of rides - they are a little more tame, but still highly enjoyable! The hair raiser was my favourite! It's worth waiting for the front row! Food choices were standard and decent prices. We ended up in mcdonalds because we'd run out of money but even it was ye same prices as outside the park. The aquarium was fantastic. Best one I've ever been to! We saw the diver feeding the sharks and rays which was unbelievable! We got to touch a starfish, and all the displays are really great.Even if the queue is long to get in it goes quickly! They told us it would be 45mins and I think it was 15 we waited! The giant pandas were gorgeous and had a lovely big enclosure to play in. And the red pandas were so cute- they had been trained a little and so were showing off! We really did have a great day and unfortunately couldn't stay for the later shows due to having to catch our flight but we would have loved to. the park is lovely, and good price considering you get a theme park AND an awesome aquarium!"

Quite possibly the best theme park in the world, as it combines rides and attractions with simply stunning views and rainforest gardens over a huge mountain site.. and because comparitively it is extremely good value at 280hk per adult (about 35aud at Sept 2012). We decided to choose Ocean Park instead of Disney as Ocean Park seemed more for grown ups! If you combined the Gold Coast's SeaWorld and DreamWorld in to one park and then chose a panoramic location, that's Ocean Park .. but much cheaper, much broader with no hint of sanitised \"franchise\" you find at movie studio parks etc. We had a great day riding the various roller coasters... the Hair Raiser was much smoother than similar giant coasters at Universal Singapore, making it a great ride. The runaway train was great fun, as was the dragon, both more traditional coasters and once again with those amazing sea views. The polar coaster was the most sedate but still good fun. Don't miss the two different water rides, as they'll help you stay cool on a hot Hong Kong day. Long, covered escalators (also with those views), move visitors up and down the side of the mountain through parklike grounds, between the various \"worlds\". There's a McDonalds on site for a quick pit stop, a welcome sight if you've been travelling Asia for a fortnight or more as we had. Then there's the two aquariums (more welcome respite from the heat) with walk through and under views of a huge range of sealife, and of course the famous pandas. They are in a state of the art, cooled environment and watching them eat, play and sleep is just delightful. There's only two pandas, but time your visit and with a bit of luck you will see eating, playing and sleeping as we did. We timed our visit to avoid Sundays and to avoid school holidays. Also, get there just before opening as many people seem to arrive from lunch time onwards and we completely avoided queues. Ocean Park made us smile time after time. This is one park we will definitely visit again."

We visited on a Tuesday and it was pretty empty during the morning. We arrived just after opening and didn't really have to wait in lines for anything. We really loved seeing the pandas! They weren't really doing much but they were so cute and very close. After lunch it seemed like the park was completely packed so even going during the week does get busy. We did visit the amusement park side but didn't go on any rides. It is a great place for families but we probably would not return if we were on our own again."

Take mtr (subway) to Admiralty and there are signs showing the exit to Ocean Park bus station. Though, a mtr station at Ocean Park is in construction. Bus 629 at this Admiralty mtr goes to O.P. I understand there are also buses departing from Central mtr and Central Star Ferry. Check O.P.'s website. Buy the bus round trip fares(HK$10.6/trip) and admission tickets at the bus station. The bus trip is around 30 mins.Try to arrive at Ocean Park early and take the cable car to the other side of the park, the Summit, as soon as you arrive. Most of the roller coaster rides are at the Summit and will be jam packed as hours go by. Same with the cable car line. You might want to go on the water rides first and then proceed to Thrill Mountain, Hair Raiser etc. I arrived at O.P. around 10 a.m., spent about three hours at the Summit, with the first two hours going on some of the same rides twice with no line and waited an hour for the last ride.Then, take the express train back which has shorter line since most people are at the Summit in the afternoon. Enjoy the rest of the park and try to leave before ~5pm since that's the time most people will leave the park and is also the starting time of mtr peak riding time. Or else, stay until 7 pm or so before the crowd leaves at closing time, 8 pm.Overall, I enjoyed this amusement park. It has quite a few rides with different level of excitement. Of course, the rides are not as thrilling as the ones at Six Flag Magic Mountain or Knotts Berry Farm. Things are quite organized and employees tried their best. I did not run into people trying to cut into lines as I had experienced two years ago at HK Disneyland. Maybe it's their employees, their system, or people learned to behave better. Drinks aren't too overpriced, an icee is HK$32(~u.s$4); food is also affordable. Of course, the must see is panda exhibition."

The park is expansive and will take up a whole day to see it all. I have been here anumber of times and notice each time how the management is making improvements ans enhancements to the facilitites.Two points on the negative side1- The dolphin show seems tired, the dolphins seem tired. They must perform about 5-6 times a day. I feel that the show is not worthy of Ocean Park's standard. It needs a large scale revamp, or needs to be scrapped altogether.2- The park closes at 7:30. It is really too early. There is no good reason why the park cannot stay open until 10pm. Even if some of the live animal exhibits had to close, the midway could remain open. Hong Kong gets extremely hot in the summer. In the evening the cool air is so nice...then everything shuts down. Hours of operation should be extended"

It has a good mix of attractions for young kids through to older kids and adults. The aquarium is disappointing - not worth queuing for. Falls short compared to so many good places I have been.The Dolphin Show is distinctly average compared to what other similar parks put on, and I'm talking small scale parks as well!We didn't spend a lot of time at the summit, where most of the rides are, as we had three small kids; so I can't give much comment.The panda area is good, and the attractions for small kids are decent. There are many things which are not in control of the park operator, so I comment here only for advice, not in rating the park:- terrible visiting in the heat of August; it would have been much more pleasant to visit at a cooler time of year.- the popularity of the park meant that it was very crowded and the 'typical visitor' falls short on queuing etiquette, manners, etc. This made it difficult to navigate the park with two strollers. Always difficult to find a quiet time to visit such a park...So, at the right time, and with the right weather... a good park."

My favourite part of the park was definitely the panda enclosure which was absolutely thrilling, and the cable car up to the top part of the park. I found getting there quite easy, the bus from Admiralty MTR is well-signposted and quite quick.I went on a weekday morning and actually found the queues pretty bad. The park was extremely crowded and I had to queue for 25 minutes to go on the large rollercoaster, not to mention numerous queue jumpers (which as an English person I find maddening). On the rollercoasters and other rides there is no need to use the lockers - instead there are shelves where you can leave your belongings and shoes while on the rides (they are next to the staff not the queue so pretty secure).There seemed to be two panda enclosures I think - although I was a bit disoriented as the map I picked up was in Chinese - d'oh! The aquarium was quite good although not really worth the 20 minutes I had to wait in the queue to get in. Something else excellent was the sea lion show - it was entertaining, heart-warming and witty, and it's worth going early to get good seats. Overall the food is reasonable (I got some pork ribs for about 20HKD) and the staff are friendly. The atmosphere is great but the queues did detract a bit from the day for me, although that is obviously not the park's fault. Definitely recommended."

The rides range from the hair raising to the death defying and you will almost certainly get wet!There is a cable car, a fabulous train which goes under the mountain, an aquarium, pandas, water fountains and enough to keep you occupied and entertained from 9am till 10pm.Try not to visit on a weekend however as it will be packed. On the day I visited some rides had waits of up to 90 minutes by mid afternoon though I did not wait more than 15 minutes for anything.I had two concerns\u00a01. The day I went it was hot, very hot, and there's no water freely available in the park. Nor is there anywhere to rest and take shade from the sun. The vast majority of places to eat we're small units offering takeaway. There are seats but with the park being busy finding somewhere to sit was \u00a0very hard. Add to this the fact that most awnings were not fully deployed and so even where seats were available there was no shade.\u00a0I felt it was deliberate to keep people spending on water and drinks and was pretty unreasonable. Not that prices were high the park entry and items in the park were generally good value and I would have stayed longer and spent more had it been comfortable but sadly it was not and we left early.2. There was a huge number of umbrellas in the hands of a great many people all trying to \u00a0keep cool and in the shade. The problem is that I had to spend the day trying to dodge the pointy bits and retaining my eye sight. At one stage I witnessed several riders use their brollies to avoid getting wet on the water rides. It was bizarre and frankly dangerous.Despite the above we had a good day but if there was to be a next time then midweek and outside of Hong Kong school holidays.I would however recommend a visit, it can be great fun."

If you've been to Sea World, this show would make you wonder whether they've actually done any proper training. Jelly fish place was ok. We didn't do any rides as the queque was crazy - 1.5 hours of wait for a 3 minute ride. Giant panda though, for those that haven't had too many opportunities to see them before, were awesome. The one called An An was very active and seemed very happy. We had our tickets worth just seeing him! The other only highlight was Tuxedo restaurant, which was another 30 minute wait before getting in. Apparently you could reserve a table - anyway, in the restaurant you could actually see the penguins swimming around as it forms part of the antartic centre - how awesome is that! The food was ok, quite pricey, but given the surrounding it's really worth it. We might go back next time but will make sure to avoid the July/ August summer holiday."

However, each time they were asked by the staff to go to the end of the line. Note that in Disneyland the staff will not enforce the rule whatsoever.(2) The park is much more spread out than Disneyland, thus, it is much less crowded(3) There are a lot more to see than just rides (Disneyland is all rides); if you only do the rides you will wait for a long time standing in line, but, if you like to see the pandas, the aquarium, etc, there is not any line to speak of. We brought our toddler and we were able to visit every single attraction that did not have minimum height requirements.(4) A lot of attractions are indoor and air conditioned which is a great refuge from the summer heat (in fact, the polar attraction is freezing inside!)(5) Do not miss the Symbio show at 8pm!Highly recommended!"

All very excited until we entered the park and realized the number of people that had also had the same idea of going there for the day. We queued up for the cable car to take us to the rollercoaster area over the top of the hill, what a mistake. We had to queue in the heat for over an hour. Thinking this was the end of our troubles and looking forwards to a good day out. We then found everything we wanted to do had a minimum queue time of an hour. In the end we managed one rollercoaster ride, a visit to the ice kingdom to see the seals and a ride on the spinning disc. What a waste of money and time (5 hours to see three attractions). We decided to take the train back through the hill at 3pm before the queues got too big as the wait for the restaurants at the top was 1.5 hours. Will I ever go back \u2013 never! Would I recommend a visit \u2013 only if you go out of season of school holidays, otherwise forget it! Not sure how Disney fairs in comparison, perhaps we should have gone there."

It is rather larger and spread out so expect a lot of walking and going up & down REALLY long escalators to get to the different sections.There are so many rides I doubt anyone could get them all done in 1 day, given the amount of time you had to wait to get on the popular rides. I opted to go to Ocean Park over Disneyland as there were more 'big kid/adult' rides here rather than young 'kiddy' rides at Disneyland.There are also some great exhibits as well including asian animals, polar bears, panda bears and the huge aquarium.Definitely recommend Ocean Park if you are visiting Hong Kong."

While there is definitely improvement in the 'hardware' , somehow more has to be done to manage crowds, queues and space for visitors. Pros : 1. More rides for big kids, interesting exhibits ESP with regards to educating visitors abt marine life, conservation etc. They did a good job getting kids engaged and sending message across. 2. Refreshed themed areas eg : the 'Old Hong Kong' is a uniquely Hk piece, with retro music and memorabilia - fun for kids and us too. 3. Transport to and fro : smooth and frequent bus services from Admiralty mtr area.. Even during peak hours . Cons : 1. Long waiting time for rides : I was disappointed to find no electronjc boards or service staff to inform visitors estimated queueing time for the different rides. I think I spent an average of 45 mins for each of the rides. I only saw the electronic board at an area just outside the cable car station - its not the right place . There has got to be a smarter way around it. 2. Blinded by camera flash : I was upset by how insensitive some visitors are to the 'no flash photography' rule. While there were staff holding placards and reminding visitors to not use flash , perhaps more can be done to educate visitors why no flash is allowed. 3. Crowds crowds crowds : lunch was a nightmare at the restaurants with queues so long, we decided to just grab a hotdogs from the nearest kiosk and settle down somewhere..(no, no shaded umbrellas or lovely picnic spot - it came down to 'anywhere shaded') The kids had fun, the adults were just there to mind the kids . I suppose that was what matters?"

We arrived 10 minutes after the park opened having bought tickets in advance from the china travel service. We waited in line to go through the turnstile only to be told to join another Q to exchange our tickets for entrance vouchers . We eventually got in about 20 minutes later. Whilst I don't feel that the fees are excessive given the size of the park and attractions there , be prepared to spend an awful lot of your day in Q's with tetchy, hot children, being pushed and shoved from all directions especially if it's a weekend in the school holidays.Also carry plenty of water and wet wipes with you and a snack as some of the cafes are quite pricey. If you and the kids manage to cope with all this , it is a great family day out with plenty to do. If you feel your nerves will be shot to ribbons , I would seriously recommend somewhere a little bit quieter"

Overall speaking, this is a nice park which you can spend the whole day on it. You can play games and see different kinds of animals at the same time.

Be prepared to queue for a long time for everything, which is the only downside for me. Even getting out of the park takes ages if you have to get the cable car back down, and then the bus back to Hong Kong. It took a good 2 hours to get back to the hotel with all the queuing.

            "review": "Great! Worth going, drinks are pricey.. Ocean Park is a hong kong experience which I have skipped going to every time I've been in hong kong. This time , since a friend was making a once in a lifetime trip, I decided to take him there. We went with a friend of ours from hong kong. We had no children with us, just 3 adults. The first thing we did was buy tickets online, I did hear you could buy discounted tickets from travel companies in advance or by the gate, we didn't because it seemed like a bit of a hassle. We just bought them from the ocean park website, and printed them at home $280 hong kong. This saved us time at the gate because we could go right in with the tickets. On the day we went it was 35 degrees celcius in hong kong, but it wasn't too bad because most of the day we had were up at the top of the mountain, doing the thrill rides. The mountain top is reached by going on the cable car, (a free trip) it's worth doing even if you plan to skip the big rides. The first ride we went on was the Hair raiser, a large rollercoaster. We went at 1130 am on a Tuesday and the ride time wait was 30 minutes. I was expecting line jumpers because of the mainland tourists from China, but there was none of it at all during the day. Everybody was quite polite actually.The rides were fun, with the longest waits being all under 30 minutes. One thing that was quite interesting, and sort of stupid on the part of Ocean Park was that often a ride would start with empty riders. There would be riders in carts that could hold 2, just riding along. So strange, there is no single rider line, and the attendants do not seek out single riders to fill out the attractions.During the middle of the day it was the height of the 35 degree day, so we ducked into the north pole adventure, an air conditioned walk through with sea lions . A nice place to stop and hide from the sun. The sea lions were very visible with no problems being seen. Then we took lunch at Tuxedos. The lunch was $600 HK for 3 people, we had a large duck pizza, 3 non alcholic drinks and a large salmon, chicken salad. Definitely a tastier alternative to a hot dog or typical amusement park food. The portions were quite large, and the best thing about it was that inside the restaurant they have a viewing area of the new penguin exhibit, where you can see the penguins without going through the south pole area. You can take pictures and hang out all there for the hot part of the day. One tip, I'd recommend for tourists who are not used to ordering food in restaurants in Hong Kong: you flag down waiters. Do not wait for them to come by and check on you, they don't. They are not being rude, they are waiting for you to flag them down for ordering, and bill payment etc. There is no catching the eye of a waiter, subtley, that's now how it's done in Hong Kong and in the Theme park there is no difference.We also got 3 cute Penguin souvenir aprons / bibs at the restaurant on cloth which actually were souvenir grade items.I'd say the restaurant was worth going to.We left the park at 730pm on the citybus which takes you to and from Admiralty Mtr ($10 hk) we had gone on about 10 rides.I'd say that there was no way a family with children could have done so many rides in the short time we were there. The rides are quite spaced apart. Small children also will have a problem at ocean park because the minimum ride for many rides was 120cm, with some rides at 135 cm. The attendants will actually check, and not let you on either .There is no disneyesque chlld hand off , while the adults take turns riding either, so if you are bringing children who are too small to ride, and you want to ride I'd recommend bringing a 3rd person to help babysit.Food and drink was relatively inexpensive in the park, and looked alright, but Ocean Park allows you to bring in as much as you want so I would recommend buying your snacks, and lunch inside the 7/11 that you'll find in the Mtr and packing it in a purse. We did not find any free water refill areas, so bring lots of water, even in restaurants the water is $42 HK.I would recommend doing Ocean Park in 2 or 3 days not trying to cram it into 1 day, it was worth it."

We are an adult couple and had good fun. There are many different attraction as little 'towns', rollercoasters, aquariums, animals, water shows, great views and so on.To get to the other side to of the park you can choose between the cable car and the train. I recommend to take the train as it is much faster and basically no waiting line - also you can get the stunning views from the park.I read also many comments regarding the waiting time and we never had to wait longer than 15 - 20 min. I guess it is depending on the time of the year. We arrived there around early lunch time and left around 4pm. If you come with kids make sure you bring a lot of sunprotection and a stroller is a must as well a comfortable shoes. It's a good work out, too ;)Down points:The food is (as I have experienced in every attraction park) a total disaster. It tastes like plastic and you have not much choice."

I speak Chinese (English Spanish too)The major issue is that the Chinese go (to say they have been). In general, due to their acceptable behavior in China, they literally stand right on top of you -as defense to guard against other people cut in line. I'm American, 185 cms and 110 kilos. No one cuts in front of me. But when it is 36c, I definitely do not need people standing on the backs of my shoes, bumping me repeatedly, , not trying to continually push past saying their friend is in front of me. So outside of the 8 hours of having ones patience tested (we waited in lines 8 hours in order to do about 10 minutes of rides... 5 rides.) I would say that the park is poorly run.First, the worst was the water ride calls raging River. We waited 75 minutes. The problem? They had capacity to load 2 lanes of boats at a time. They choose to only staff one lane. Why? It is a sunny Sunday afternoon. Had they staffed appropriately, the line would have had twice the load speed.They have clocks telling you wait times -but amazingly the clocks are no where near the rides. They don't have staff informing you of actual or approximate times. I was told 20 minutes for one ride, it was almost 2 hours, and tools 90 minutes for one, and it was 35.You should definitely skip the north pole exhibit. It has 2 seal s, , and a walrus. 90 minute wait.If you are dying to go somewhere, go to Chimelong in Guangzhou. Yeah, the people are the same, but it is cheaper and had better rides and much better management."

Although crowded we were able to see everything and not feel enclosed. We then went through 'Old HK' to get to the cable car - only a 5 minute wait which was great considering we got there first thing when thousands were all arriving at the same time. The cable car views are worth the visit. We then hit the rides - to begin with the queues were not too bad but as they day went on they were long so we chose carefully which ones we really wanted to see. The North and South Pole sections were not as good as I had expected but the air con was welcomed by that point! The information about the conservation work made up for it tough and there was something for everyone. We got the train down the mountain and saw the Pandas - we all fell in love with the red pandas!Once tip for the top is if you want to see any of the shows - get there early to get a seat!Great day out and something for everyone."

It was a Musical Fountain + Laser kind of show and it was really awesome. The crowd wasn't too bad except for one of the rides in which we queued for about an hour.

I really liked the aquarium too but as it was one of the more crowded venue, it wasn't really as enjoyable as the people do push you around and stick their heads in whenever they want."

It is a must for anyone who wants to see the pandas - I was glued to the spot for at least 30 minutes watching them!Views from the cable car are amazing but definitely not for those with issues with heights!Great show with the dolphins and sealions (which I was not expecting!) & other shows around the park. Rides are not fabulous but some of the rollercoasters offer even more great views from right at the edge of the cliffs! Worth trying them out if the queues aren't too long."

If I went again I would pack a cut lunch as the food looked fairly ordinary. The gondola ride is worth doing but the old Hong Kong display is quite underwhelming.

The exception were the rides that were further down the mountain, where my kids repeatedly went on the roller coaster. Of course, we knew it was going to be hot but we didnt know we were in for a typhoon level 3 :-). The rides closed down at 3:00pm so we visited the exhibits. The aquarium was cool and so was old Hong Kong. The panda was nice and we got to see it. The Dolphin and seal show was nice too. I would compare this park more to Seaworld. The food prices were reasonable as well.As you exit the MTR on the Hong Kong side, there is a MTR store when you head up to ride the Ocean Park bus. They sell discount Ocean Park tickets. Adult @ $250 HKD and child @ $125 HKD versus regular tix at $280 and $140; respectively. This was a nice discount & we didnt need to pre-buy. I also found discount tix @ China Travel services at $240/$120 but you have to preorder and cant change dates so it was too cumbersome. Make sure you check the weather before you go ;-)It's very easy to get to, MTR, then Ocean Park Bus. At the Park, you have to either ride the cable car or the submarine to the other side of the mountain for the rides. We took the submarine there and it was a nice experience. However on the return, after rides were closed around 3pm, the cable cars were closed as well (due to typhoon), the submarine was the only way back to exit. It was crowded and the pushing/shoving was horrendous. Children were pushed as well as the elderly to enter the submarine. Not sure if there's a person limit capacity but i'm sure it was way beyond. Aside from the lack of manners/courtesy/danger of fellow attendees, the visit was a nice visit. Just make sure you leave a few hours before the end of the day."

I took my 5 year old son and he could not go on quite a few of the rides as he was too young but there were still rides he could go on. The park is quite spread out across a large mountainous area but there are cable cars and shuttle trains so easy to get around from area to area. The aquarium is great and I especially loved the Jelly Fish house which was stunning with loads of changing coloured jelly fish. The pandas were also fun to see. It is a mix of ocean animals and rides and makes for a fun day. We got there early and it was quiet but by about 2.30pm it started to get really crowded so we left but had had a great day. Easiest way to get there is by going to Admiralty station and catching the Ocean Park bus from there as you can get your tickets etc there and you get dropped off right outside the park. The buses also return you to Admiralty at the end of the day."

My best advise would be to try to visit in the cooler months, our first visit was September and even though we had plenty of water and umbrella's the heat took it toll on all of us. There is very little shade anywhere and very long lines for some of the rides. There is something here for all ages. There are plenty of food outlets here, the toughest decision was which one to choose. Don't just take the Cable Car up and down from the top level of Ocean Park as there are very long lines especially in the afternoon/evening when people are starting to head home, do yourself a favour and take their train, it was great and much faster and less crowded. Don't miss the fire and light show they have just before closing it was incredible. Make sure you have 2 days for Ocean Park you will be disappointed if you only do one day."

New coasters have come in with Hair-raiser being the best with loop-the-loops. Newer and more exciting look to the park! Much better value than Disneyland. HKD 240 for adults compared to HKD 399 for Disneyland !!!The second parking lot has now closed, and everyone enters through the main entrance. Get there early (we did it at 9:30) and got to the coasters early . Hardly anyone were on them, and we got round all the coasters by 11:30. However, when we went for the repeat Hair-raiser ride, it was around 40 minutes waiting time.Best way to cool off is to go to the Panda's enclosure and the Aquarium - wonderful air-conditioned delight!Negative aspect - waiting line / queue management is non-existent, coupled with excitable Mainlanders, who use a lot of elbows..... :( Ride staff are a bit lame. They hover and wait, and not interested in getting the line going! If they paid them by the number of people they put through the ride, it will be a lot more interesting !Like California, they should use water-cooling with their fans to help people cool down! More shade is needed, and UMBRELLAS SHOULD BE BANNED !!!!!The seaworld dolphin show was very good, but mainly in Cantonese with a smattering in English and Mandarin.Go there - but be prepared to get very very hot !!!"

There are also a lot of food outlets to choose from and novelty shops where you can buy your souvenir items.One thing to note though is that the place is really big so you need to get a map upon entry or you'll spend most of your time moving in circles trying to find the attraction that you want. :-)"

It was a Friday and quite busy in some sections of the park, especially in the Thrill Mountain section. Our first choice was the Hair Raiser roller coaster, which was only opened in December 2011. The line was very long and it took us about an hour to get on the ride, which if you are a roller coaster fan was awesome. The park is huge and you need a whole day to see it all, unfortunately we did not have enough time and chose to catch the larger rides over the aquarium and other animal attractions (including Pandas). Most of the rides are pretty good, some rides we could jump straight on including The Dragon and The Abyss. The only other ride we had to wait a long time for was The Rapids and it was lame! Not worth the wait at all. Even for a week day it was quite busy, I would avoid on a weekend as the lines would be crazy!Overall Ocean Park was an awesome place, I wish we had more time there."

First of all you are picked up at 8am but its 10 \u2013 10:30 before you arrive at the park. Where are you during this period, well Gray Line take you to a jewellery factory where you are paraded into a large showroom where they want you to buy things. I was not impressed with this at all.Once you get to the park you are advised of your meeting spot and pick up time which is 4.45. If we were to visit the park again we would make our own way there. If you take the MTR (train) to Admiralty station, then they have a citybus shuttle that will take you to the park. We found that language was a barrier with the drivers on the shuttle bus. it cost about HK $10.60 each, make sure you have exact change or close to it as you don\u2019t get change, you don\u2019t even hand the money to the driver \u2013 you place it in a box.Now onto the park \u2013 the park is split into 2, one is for the animals, the other for the rides. As it was school holidays while we were there we checked out the rides in the theme park but the lines were too long and it was way too hot to wait.The animals were nice to see \u2013 the highlight obviously being the Pandas and there are 2 locations in the park where you can see them. We had lunch at Neptune\u2019s Restaurant which I do recommend, it\u2019s an amazing feeling eating lunch in front of the aquarium wall. Definitely a highlight of my whole HK trip.I would go back to do the rides and see the pandas again, I\u2019d just make sure it wasn\u2019t school holidays!(PS - They do a bag check before you go in to check for food)"

They don't have an effective system for queuing like a fast/express pass so expect long waits for rides or other attractions. There aren't any stand out rides either save for the roller coaster that is near the cliff side and offers a great view for thrill seekers. The performances aren't very entertaining either and it definitely won't sustain your attention if you don't know how to speak chinese.On the plus side, the park is well maintained and they have a great cable car ride and a bunch of escalators to make it easier for visitors to go around the park. It's a decent amusement park but it's loses out to the more modern and extravagant competition like Disneyland, Universal Studios, or even Everland in Korea."

Since then, I visit here every summer with my family.We go to Ocean park every year we visit HK.Ocean Park constantly changes, it's never boring.OCEAN EXPRESSSince 2001 we discovered that the train that goes between main entrance and 'the other side of mountain' is much more convenient than the cable car. This time we went back and forth between 2 sections of the park -4 times. The little train only take 3 minutes to cross over, and there is almost no line. Plus it is air conditioned! It was 33C when we visited this time. The aircon felt really good. While we rode the Ocean express, we heard others had to wait for the cable car for 1 hour.THRILL MOUNTAINThis was new since we were here summer of 2011. This is the year my kids can fully enjoy roller coasters, so they did almost all of them. The hair raiser looks scary, but my kids and their friends loved it. My kid was 11, her friend was 13.We tried Mine train first -- to ease kids into the roller coaster business, then the Dragon -- which is 30 yr old? then Hair Raiser. I didn't even go... I am too old for that. Kids enjoyed so much they went twice.POLAR ADVENTUREThere is a new polar adventure. It was not fully open while we visited, but the penguin part was open. It was c.o.l.d. inside. It was fun though. Ocean Park did a great job with the display and education information.OTTERSThere are 2 otters near the Panda and gold fish place, near the front entrance. It's not advertised much, but there are otter feeding time. Somehow we always get there to see the 2:15 feeding time. Those 2 otters are so much fun!RED PANDAThere is red panda feeding time too, I think it is around 2pm, we missed it. They are pretty active.LINESWe were there on a Thursday. Go in right at opening time (10am). We went to Thrill mountain first -- which is the summit side, that require taking the Ocean express to cross over. There was almost no one there. No lines for anything. No line for mine train\u3002 When we visited the sea lions at Pacific Pier, almost no one but we were there. The park got busier after 2pm. Getting on Hair Raiser took 20 minutes or so."

If you plan to go on a weekend/holiday/school holiday, check the ocean park map before you go, decide the attraction you like most and plan your route carefully. Majority of the theme park rides are at Headland. If you like the rides, I would suggest to take the cable car up to the Headland as early as possible to avoid long queue. And take the train down from Headland to Lowland, the train can take many people in a single ride."

No need to rent a locker at the bottom if you have bags and small items that will fall out during the ride -- there is a bin nearby that you can deposit and collect these pre and post ride. Though if you have shopped and have valuables, then rent the locker at the base of the ride before heading up.Don't ride if you have just eaten a big meal! If you are the nauseous kind, your meal will definitely come back up. I also don't suggest the ride for kids pre-teen or below (even if they are tall enough) since the ride can be daunting. It's also best to go on a day when it isn't raining, and preferably clear one. Once may not be enough of a ride! Though ou'll have to queue up again for another go, it's going to be worth it."

Saw the Pandas, both sleeping) the aquarium (very good view of lots of sting rays, some sharks and colourful fish) had a look around and then caught the gondolas down the hill. Magic. Very high up with spectacular views. Love it! Not too expensive either, so great value for money."

Not crowded. F&B quite expensive. Ride on the cable car! i am totally afraid of heights but acted cool for the kids. They loved it very much. Long queue, and some push their way to jump queue. Its normal here it seems. Try to guard your line. You can easily spend 3-4 hours here. A must visit."

The rides are included in your entry prce however to go to the shows you have to pay. Its easly accessed by both bus and trains but wear comfy shoes it takes all day to see everything and you go up and down hills all day, there are the longest escalators l have ever seen to help you get up and down but as there is only one entrance/exit its a long walk to get out of the place. Its a very clean place and the animals are well cared for and patrons are asked to be quiet in several locations, there were no empty cages so visitors saw at least 1 creature on show at every window,a definite visit if you can fit it in."

This is a wonderful one day trip to take your family, or just for a couple to enjoy the rides and marine life.

Following my check in to Marco Polo Hong Kong (chosen as I am a GHA Discovery Black Card Member) I was informed that my free local experience was a visit to meet and greet some giant pandas at their local attraction Ocean Park. As i was flying solo on this trip I decided that I would take up the offer the following afternoon unless I found something else better to do!!!A limo was arranged to pick up and drop off and as I wasn't tempted by any of the other Hong Kong highlights I decided to take up the experience with very little expectation.What a wonderful park clean friendly and visually inspiring from the minute I walked in to leaving nearly three hours later. I could only wish I had my children with me as I felt guilty having all this theme park fun without them!!The honorary panda keepers experience was what I was there for and this was a memory I will keep with me for a long time interacting with both giant and red pandas behind the scenes preparing food and hand feeding them bamboo shoots (with the benefit of a large steel door between me and the 135kg giant panda)I am not known for my bravery around animals however I was completely awestruck as to the level of care and attention these animal recieved and as such cannot wait to return with my family to share this wonderful experience with them all.Highly recommended"

We bought some discount tickets before exiting the MTR station and then got on the bus to the Park. We only needed our Octopus cards to travel there. For 3 adults, 1 child, and 1 baby it was about USD$90. We limited our attractions to those that would accommodate a 4 year old and 1 year old, so my review doesn't include any of the roller coaster rides or even the merry-go-round. Even without those rides, Ocean Park still offers a family with young kids a full days entertainment.When we arrived at Ocean Park, we didn't see the elevator and took the kids and the stroller up the escalator. At the entrance was a large lake with a water show every few minutes. There would be a fireworks show at night but we didn't stay that late. We decided to head into the aquarium, located right next to the lake. There is an elevator that you can take if you have a stroller like we did. There was an open water area where you could see some fish swimming. Then my son touched a starfish and we went deeper into the building. There were large glass areas under and around the aquarium where we could see many large fish, sting rays, and hammerhead sharks. There are little displays for unique sea creatures like the flashlight fish, the camouflaged seahorses, and spider crabs.Next we lined up for the cable car ride. To get to the line, we walked through the newly opened \"old Hong Kong\" area. There are little carts to get some food, snacks, and drinks. Everything seems reasonably priced, though I do not recommend the soft serve cone - it was syrup and ice and almost no milk or cream or the egg waffle snack - just flavorless. The coke ice was pretty good. The line at 10:30am was not very long and we were able to pile into one cable car. The cable cars do not stop, so have the attendant help you with the stroller and when you arrive on the other side, have the attendant pull it out. It was a beautiful ride over Ocean Park and the surrounding ocean.Once we got to the other side we went to the rainforest display and to one of the gift shops. We found the kiddie ride area and rode the little pink train ride twice. My son is a big fan of trains. He wasn't tall enough for the carousel and the rest of the area seemed like amusement park/fair games to win prizes, so we did not go further. We rode the Ocean Express train back down to the entrance side. There is a cool movie that plays on the roof of the train while you are riding down.Now back at the entrance we went to see the pandas! Outside the entrance to the Panda exhibit is the crocodile exhibit. The display crocodiles look a lot like the real thing. There were 3 pandas in the large air conditioned picturesque enclosure. It's the big white warehouse that can be seen from the cable car ride. There were also 2 red pandas that are a cross between a panda and a raccoon. We were just in time to watch the red pandas being feed. The other pandas were either eating or lounging around or sleeping. Outside the panda exhibit was a koi pond and the goldfish exhibit. There were lots of unique looking goldfish. It was almost time to go, but my son wanted to ride the cable car again. We went to the line and it was over an hour wait. So we noticed that the return cable cars were empty and decided to go back to the other side via the Ocean Express train and come back via cable car. It worked out since we only had to wait for 1 express train and there was no line on the return cable car ride.We rode the bus back to the MTR station and headed back to the hotel. The kids were exhausted and slept. There was definitely a lot more to see and experience at Ocean Park, so we are looking forward to going back in a few years when the kids are older and not afraid to ride some of the rides."

No doubt the park has vastly improved and is in a very good state. However, our son was very disappointed that most rides on the 'mountain' were not suitable for him because of his height. We asked a member of staff what children were allowed to do in this area and it was only the theatre where they show sea lions and dolphins. No surprise our son and we were not impressed. There are a few rides for younger children at the bottom of the park past the pandas. But - in my opinion - that would not justify the expense to come here for a day. At Disneyland at least he could use almost all rides and was very happy. It would have been good if it would have been pointed out to us that the majority of the rides were not suitable for a 6 year old."

Its really a big place with awesome aquarium area and cosy panda area. Besides that, we can take the cable car up to the higher area within and the ride will give you a spectacular view of hong kong. Again, coz we went in summer so the hot weather make queuing for rides pretty challenging and tiring. Other than that, ocean park is simply awesome!! I highly recommend this place. Plus it is accessible for wheelchair bound individuals and getting a cab ride back is also very easy as there are abundance of cabs just outside.

The food was great - very delicious options at a reasonable price.My only complaint is that there are very few fans, misters and shade around the park, and in the 30 degree heat it can become very difficult to walk anywhere without drowning in a pool of sweat."

            "review": "Worth a visit, some great rides!. I visited with two children, 8 and 11, who are theme park veterans, were fresh from Disneyland, and so a very jaded pair. The decision of both was that it was better than Disneyland as far as the rides and thrills (not as good in theming). It was a very enjoyable day, and we could certainly have stayed longer (eventually driven out at about 3.30 by a thunderstorm...)Transport - we caught bus 629 from Admiralty, having first caught the MTR there. There are very clear signs leading from the MTR to the Ocean Park bus (my obsessive checking on the net of just which exit to take was quite unnecessary), and once you arrive at the bus area there are well ordered and shepherded queues for the buses. You can also buy your theme park tickets right up where you wait for the buses, to save time once there. The trip was only 10-15 minutes, much quicker than anticipated. Reverse trip again it was very well ordered to get people onto the buses, but a longer trip.Theming - there are themes to some extent in various areas of the park, and an 'Old Hong Kong' section which is cute. Generally it is very nice, and there are some lovely gardens, although not quite up to Disney standard. Getting around the park - getting around can be by cable car from one side of the park to another, train from one side to another, escalators, and walking (some fairly long, deserted walks in places). The cable car was a great experience, with beautiful views, and quite a dramatic trip. We arrived early and so had a cable car to just the three of us. On the way back we caught the train due to a thunderstorm closing the cablecar, which initially seemed a let down, but proved to be a great ride in itself due to the 'show' on the ceiling. While some of the walks were long and uphill, we really enjoyed the scenery, and the feeling of being almost alone within a theme park.Food - There was a good variety of food, and a lot of stalls where you could get a snack. There are a variety of restaurants which could suit most dietary needs. The restaurant we ate at had a lovely view but very ordinary food, and there was a mistake with the order which meant I missed out on eating. Rides - some really great thrill rides here, as well as an area for little kids (we didn't make it there). Most of them were so good that we raced to get straight back on again! On the day we were there (A Friday, which was initially fine weather) queues were very short, with an absolute maximum of 10 minutes (although the bungee trampoline would be longer) and many where we could get straight back on or even stay on. One thing we did find was that there were a few rides (about 3) with unusually strict height requirements compared to what I have found on similar rides elsewhere, which meant that my 8 year old could not ride. On one ride (the drop ride) she was turned away initially when we reached the front of the line, without being measured. Upon exiting and seeing the height requirement we found that she exceeded it by 1 or 2cm, so had to line up again, which was annoying.Other - aquarium, shows, pandas, other animals - all was very enjoyable, and we didn't manage to see it all in one day. Also have to say it is an amazingly scenic amusement park - the terrain, the greenery and the water views (including seen from rides) were just beautiful. Well and truly enough to keep pretty much anyone occupied for a day.Overall, it was a great visit and one which I would definitely repeat.Tip: Head straight for the cable car upon arrival to avoid queues for both the cable car and the rides on the other side"

As a comparison, we visited Disneyland HK (again) the next day and it was our unanimous decision that OP needs a total overhaul if it is to remain a top attraction. On the to-do list - aquarium - other than the giant fish tank, the exhibits and placement need a total re-think. Langkawi's underwater world is much better. Rides : unfortunately, not that interesting and some are just old and tired (eg carousel next to the Old HK area - just compare that to the Cinderella carousel in HK Disney and you will know what i mean). Animal shows - ok, but not something that I will go out of my way to watch. Game stalls at kids area - best avoided like the plague unless you loads of cash to burn. What was good was the cable car ride (awesome views!) and the pandas (very cute, mesmerising), which went a long way to mitigate the ticket price. I think OP tries to do too much and as a result there is a lot of stuff, but not all of it is good. We won't return unless there is a very compelling reason to do so."

We went during the month of my birthday, which entitled me to get in for 1/2 price. One of the things we liked the most was the tower drop. It was quite exciting, but not so much so that we had to do it a second time. Perhaps, besides the Panda exhibit, the best attraction was the cable car ride high above the mountains and the sea. The view was outstanding. Certainly one of the more fun things we've gotten to do in Hong Kong."

The dolphin and sea lion performance is boring although the view of the ocean in the backdrop is beautiful. The signs in the park are not clear. It is frustrating especially when I am trying to catch a show or talk and cannot locate the place. I gave up trying to fit all the shows & talks in one day which are sub-standard performances anyway, and instead concentrate on the rides which are more enjoyable. The park looks very 80s and I felt like I was transported back to 1980s (30 years ago!). The park needs a renovation if you ask me. When I first enter the park, there isn't a wow feeling, instead it feels very old-fashioned. What is beautiful is the park is located where the ocean and mountain meets so the nature side of it is beautiful but not the manmade side. However as it is located at the mountain, it is very hilly and tiring to walk the hilly paths.The Good: Visit the pandas during their feeding time so that you can watch the pandas eating, which is interesting. I like the goldfish exhibit too where there are so many variants of goldfishes out there. I took the train ride to the other side of the park where the rides were. The train ride is interesting if you can pretend you are underwater when the train is actually cutting across the mountain. The cable car ride back in the evening is very nice too, as the line is closest to the ocean edge. The show at the end is quite good too with water and fire effects."

The animal experiences were my favourites. We went to the marine life show where the dolphins and sealions entertained the crowds with their antics. We fed the sealions ($3 a cup of fish)...my highlight of the day. We also got to see the giant panda bears. Our only downside was the Aquarium. The crowds of people inside were unbelievably rude and bad mannered. Everyone was banging into everyone, no apologies, queue skipping, barging past people, really awful experience. Couldn't wait to get out of there. Thankfully we could see when we exited that they had held back some people from entering until the crowd dissipated, really bad experience in there. Otherwise, good fun park, I still prefer Disneyland but that's just because I love Disney...the rides in OP are more adult and there is more to do...it's also $100 dollars cheaper per person than Disney...good day out!"

We've recently been to Hong Kong (4 days in mid May 2012) and as time was a factor, we couldn't decide which was better - Disneyland or Ocean Park. After asking the locals and doing extensive reading, we decided on Ocean Park. What a ball!! To book the day pass entrance ticket, it's far easier (and cheaper) to see if your hotel arranges this and rather do it through them. If you're into white knuckle rides then you simply have to go on The Hair Raiser, Flash, The Abyss, The Dragon, The Water ride and the Pirate Ship - they were all fun and we just lined up and went time after time!! The other \"normal\" fun park rides are also available. The Polar Express rollar coaster ride will be opening soon.Great Panda's, Golden Monkeys, Red \"Fire Fox\" Panda's and cool aquatic life. (No flash photography obviously.) When it's hot an humid, take LOTS of water to drink and enjoy the cable car ride from one side of the park, over the hill overlooking the South China Sea to the Bird and Dolphin/Sea Lion shows. \"Locals\" are a little rude by jumping the que but just stand your ground. Public transport is easy, effcient and cheap. Just have a map, the correct change ready or, even easier, buy on Octopus card (much like an Oyster card) and top up when you need to. This card works at KFC, 7 Eleven, and the MTR system as well. Handy!Can't wait to go back just to do the rides again!!! Who says that Hong Kong is just for shoppers???PS - Ladies, if you're not used to the heat and humidity, then just forget about wearing any decent make-up. It all melts off anyway!!!

The pandas, the park's star attraction, were in a bit better shape, but still had to put up with people banging on the glass and flash photos (there were staff around but no one was enforcing the 'quiet and no flash' rule') Quite an upsetting visit, paired with the condition of some of the caged birds (Great Hornbills in a small cage).

( if you dont want to watch the dolphin show, take advantage of the dolphin show time to sit the cable car. we did that and the waiting time was less than 10 mins coz majority of the people were at the show) 6) when u reach the bottom, make ur way to the panda exhibit or go see the aquarium. aquarium should be last because that is the place with aircon. ENJOY!!"

Ocean Park is a huge huge place and you have to walk quite a bit. The rides are similar to most theme park rides but the main attraction is definitely the dolphin show.The dolphin show is at an amphitheater and only certain parts of it are shaded. The best thing to do is to arrive about 30mins before the show and grab any seats in the center towards the back row. That way you'll get to see the entire pool under the cool shade. The first show before noon is the best as it is not too hot yet.Food is alright, plenty of choices but the queue is long everywhere during lunch time. The only thing that we probably disliked was the queue to every attraction. The queue was caused by the Park's policy to get your photos taken before entering the attraction. Of course you can opt not to buy the photos after that. You can even opt not to take the photo in the first place.You must try the cable car and the hot air balloon ride at least once."

I found the second visit more interesting as we covered more attractions. There are many interesting stuff to see, like animals, aquarium as well as thrilling rides. The park is divided into two sections, Summit and Waterfront. To get to one part to the other u have to either take the Ocean Express Train or cable car. Suggest going up to Summit by one mode of transport and coming down by the other, so u get to experience both. I liked the cable car better cos of the view u get to see outside! Mountains, seas, houses, totally breathtaking! It was even cooler during the cable car ride as we went in autumn.The rides are very thrilling so we didn't take them. However we took the Ocean Park Tower which brings u all the way up and u get a great view below.Remember to watch the dolphin show and visit the giant pandas. Unfortunately the pandas were sleeping during my trip there :(Bayview restaurant located at the Summit has pretty nice food with ok pricing, the set comes with ice cream. Souvenirs in the park are cute but expensive.Tip: avoid weekends and china holidays it gets very very very crowded"

Upon entering the park you can visit the panda exhibit and the aquarium. Then hop on the sky ride to take you over the mountain to the other side where all the rides are, the views are amazing. Be aware it is very hot so wear light breathable clothing and be sure to keep drinking water. Then spend the day going on all the rides. We loved the log flume and wild raft rides because we could get soaked, my only complaint was the water wasn't cold enough, the heat is very intense. The teens in our group were brave enough to go on the roller coaster that seems to fly above the water. There are dolphin and seal shows throughout the day. Also many food stands and a carnival area where you can play games for prizes. To get back to the exit, take the train through the mountain or, you can take the sky ride again."

We got there around 11 something in the morning and there were no lines at all. We got to go on every ride we wanted and saw the pandas. It is a big park but I think if you plan accordingly, you can see everything you want. I watched the dolphin show and it was good but if you've seen many dolphin shows before, it's nothing extraordinary. The views are magnificent. Overall, a good experience on a not so busy weekday."

Got to see two chubby Pandas, chewing their bamboo leaves to glory. In fact they were too meticulous and clean, in finishing up their meal. Very intriguing indeed! Also the couple of Red Pandas were also a thrill to watch. So cute. May was too hot in Ocean Park and thanks to the Pandas, we got to enjoy in the cooler environs laid out for them.Besides the Pandas, Ocean Park is a combination of Sea World and many other roller coaster rides, which would consume one whole day if you were to complete all of them.Thanks to the cheap Digital Photography, there is someone taking a picture of you at various points and waiting to sell that to you for couple of hundreds of HKDs.The Ocean Theatre experience, where they show a live event with the Dolphins and Seals is a disappointment. If you have been to the Sea World in the US or witnessed Shamu the killer whale, you would know the difference. Anyway, the Ocean Park is worth the visit, just for the Pandas. There are not many of them and what a lovely creatures they are."

The first side has lots of animal exhibits, gentler rides for little kids and mellow adults, a quaint \"Old Hong Kong\" reconstructed street, and pay-as-you-go games that your little ones will love. The far side has the serious rides, theatres for dolphin shows, and more. Travelers to Hong Kong, as well as those who live here, must pay a visit to Ocean Park.

The mountain express train was incredible and just looked like something out of a 'Jules Verne' novel. Disneyworld across at Lantau Island cannot compete with the diverse attractions on offer here.The cable car ride to the higher level provided magnificent views across to Repulse Bay and the sea and the new Old Hong Kong street reconstruction was very entertaining.One of the minor points about the park was the price of drinks and snacks on sale.

Upon picking up a map at the entrance of the park, one fact was realized: Ocean Park is huge.And certainly, one day was not enough to explore all attraction of this place.I and friends decided to first go to the area where the extreme rides are. The trip via cable car provided a magnificent view of the south HK. The cable car is small but just enough for 6 people.It was a weekday so there were not a lot of people in the park. Lining up for queue did not take a lot of time. We rode the the Hair Raiser twice without really waiting for too long. Same scenario was seen for the other attractions. For kids too young for thrill rides, Ocean Park offers various shows. Among them is sea lion show which was too kiddie for my taste but nonetheless was appreciated. It was lightly raining and the venue was open so that affected the whole experience a bit.There are lots of things to do around Ocean Park and one must have a well thought plan because one day is absolutely not enough.The park closes with a great fountain show.The only things that may need room for improvement are the following:1. Food was expensive. But then such is expected in all theme parks.2. The queue for cable car back to the main grounds was terribly long. This was the only queuing we did not appreciate. An hour would be wasted before one can get to board a cabin.3. There were not enough buses for back to the nearest MTR station (Admiralty). Again, we waited under the drizzle for minutes.Overall, Ocean Park was definitely a fun-filled place. Ideal for families and friends."

It is well worth a visit and don't forget your camera as you will see pandas, red pandas, bubble blowing seals, birds, all kinds of fish & sea creatures in the aquariumand & you'll get to ride the cable car or the very interesting train!!There are kiddy rides, water rides, carousels and rollercoasters and of course all the souvenirs and character meet & greets.This Park is very well worth a visit and allow a full day to enjoy it all!!"

There are rides and animals in the 1st section, then you line up to go on a cable car over the other side for rides (lots for older children/ adults) and plenty more restaurants (including maccas) and alley games and shows with the sea animals. The birds there are beautiful! The bird show was spoken in another language and we were unable to understand any of it, however it was still good to see.

The main problem we had was that we visited on a weekend (probably a mistake) and the crowds made the experience unpleasant at times. We rushed through some things, just to get away from the hordes of people. We had to take a ticket to wait for a table at any one of the restaurants for lunch, and then service was very slow. Walking between attractions was difficult, because of the sheer volume of people. With less people it might have been a better experience."

My son is too young for the rest of the ride. For the water related ride do bring along a raincoat/ waterproof attire. if not, you could buy one on site but for the money you are spending to buy a disposable rain jacket you might as well bring along your own. Also, bring your own drinks/food; any drinks/food in the park is always expensive, for example, a plate of roast duck rice would set you back HK$70, which you could get a take away on your way to the park for HK$28. You would always find a nice spot for a picnic so do consider bring your own food/drinks. The only one thing i find not as convenience is the bus that you have to take from Admiralty Station; there is always a queue there; not so fun when you have young kids waiting in the queue."

The lower area was mainly entertainment and rides for the smaller kids and the high side which you can catch the cable car (recommended) or the train was for the thrill seekers. As the theme park is situated on a steep hillside the rides are three times as frightening. I was amazed as to how they built this park virtually hanging on the mountain edge. If thrill is not your style then visiting the pandas and the massive aquarium is worth a visit."

I had no special expectations except that I thought there should be talents dressed in old Hong Kong costumes performing one thing or another besides other ought-to-have old Hong Kong attractions which would bring back people's memories of life experiences. Disappointingly, most of the buildings that I saw were only wallpapers. Only one actor dressed in a rooster was seen. Based on his costume, he was meant to be one selling the 'aeroplane olive snack' but he just wandered around with nothing to sell. The so-called 'authentic' old Hong Kong snacks mentioned in the promotion were not made and did not taste the way I had when I was in Hong Kong decades ago. I give 3 stars out of 5 only because this review is about the Ocean Park which is good in general. Otherwise if it's for the 'Old Hong Kong' attraction itself, I can only give 1 star out of 5."

There is a good range of roller coasters and water rides - with v little queuing. There are plaenty of places to get a snack etc. Our younger son really enjoyed the dolphin show - which wa simpressive ( even if I anm not sure about the ethics).

Smitten by the brilliance of the Ocean Park from a previous visit in 2002, I couldn't wait to enter the portals of the park once again in Jan. 2012. Alas, I was in for a disappointment.Not that the park itself is too bad, but I was initially put off by the hordes of tourists from the mainland. The park was in fact so crowded that walking in places was difficult. Thank goodness for my online advance booking, I saved hours in waiting in queue just to get in.The wait for the cable car was two hours minimum, walking from the Chinese Sturgeon exhibit to the jellyfish spectacular took almost an hour for all one could see was bobbing black heads.OK, so the overcrowding was not exactly the park's fault.But several of the 'improvements' (since 2002) were not really improvements at all. The large Atoll Reef aquarium at the upper level has now been moved to the lower level and is now called Grand Aquarium. When I eventually managed to fight my way in, through all the overcrowding, I found it has shrunk considerably in size. And instead of being surrounded by clear glass panels on all sides, you now have to stare upwards at the fish. The walls are made of mock rock like formations with thin strips of glass in between, giving a very limited view.The terrific Goldfish Pagoda of 2002 set against a terrific lake landscaping is now called Goldfish Treasures, and is but a mere shadow of its former glory. This too has been relocated, and there is no sign of the lagoon at all, something else is built along the lagoon.The terrific Amazing Amazon exhibit has gone too, and is now the Emerald Trail. It is nothing but that, just a trail. though it does make for a refreshing change from the crowds outside, with its recorded bird sounds and lack of crowds. Reminders of the former Amazing Amazon format are the suspension bridge, and the toy but realistic looking mechanical anaconda, which just sits there, without the mock strike.All in all, over commercialism has robbed the Ocean Park of its former charm. It's now blatantly, well, commercial, with much of the earlier attractions severely watered down.It's might still be interesting for a first timer though, and the colourful Ocean Park 35th anniversary dances within the premises were a saving grace, in only a trifle.And yes, someone mentioned pandas. There is a Giant Panda Exhibit which is supposed to house two pandas gifted from China in 2007. Only one was there, and there is a lot of unnecessary cage-side furniture added around the enclosure. There is another in the Amazing Asian Animals exhibit. Wonder what came of An An and Jia Jia which we had seen in 2002, which was at that time the pride of the Ocean Park. And yes, the dinosaur trail exhibit has gone as well.Food stall abound, but one is at times choked by the pungent smell of cooking meat at several places."

Can't imagine what weekends will be like.The best part about the Park was the cable car ride (except for the 30 to 45 min queue), and the fact that the Summit is located on top of the hill - the spring weather was cool and scenery beautiful.Owing to all the queues, only had time to work in one show, 2 rides, the jellyfish exhibit and the Aquarium in one afternoon. Factor in time for queueing :("

            "review": "Good but not really a must do. To put in context, we are a 21 year old couple who really like animals which was the main reason for going. We do like theme parks although only been to the theme parks on the Gold Coast in Australia, Disneyland Anaheim and Universal Studios. If it is your first trip to HK then this probably shouldn'y be on your list unless you have a lot of time. It was good and nothing wrong with it but wasn't amazing. Probably worth a visit simply to see the Pandas while you still can. Aquarium was pretty good but probably on the same level as Sydney Aquarium so if you have been to Sydney you basically know what to expect. Dolphin show was alright. Rides were good in particular the Hair Raiser rollercoaster. Food was bad and expensive, typical for theme parks. If you have kids it is probably a nice day trip.Quick travel story: Park is split in two levels and to get to the top there is either an express train/tram or the cable car. If there are thunderstorm warnings the cable car closes which it did when we were there. This means the only way down is the train/tram. There were thousands of people trying to get down on this one tram which holds maybe 100-150 people. People were literally pushing to get to the front of the line and there were some children and old people getting crushed which was pretty sad (no injuries). It was quite an experience. It was funny afterwards but at the time is was not fun. I think they might need to look into possibly building another way up and down the mountain."

It took exactly one hour in a queue to get our entry ticket and when we finally got into the attraction, it was queue after queue after queue to see anything or do anything. Further to this, the \"top park\" did not have any sort of flow to it and you found yourself doubling back over long distances to see anything or do anything."

Ocean Park emphasizes the environment protection and consersation, that's very meaningful. Awesome view from the summit. A little drawback is that not so enough signboards and staff to guide you through within the park, it's quite tiring with the slopes as the area is more to a natural landscape . You may just ask around, most of the staff are quite helpful. But we encountered a very unfriendly staff, she was at one of outdoor booth that sells stuffs. Anyway, it's full of fun!"

Hours at this park are a bit odd, I believe they open a 9am and close at 9pm. The view at the park is beautiful. Easy to get to by the local bus. You can buy the tickets for the park at the bus terminal along with the park tickets. This is a very nice park, I would do this park instead of Disney if you have teens. Disney is more for little children in Hong Kong."

There is so much to comment. For starters the the ques was 45-60min each. We spent about 2,5 hours in ques inside.The park is split into two areas, where the entrance and exit is in one area and the rides in the other. The only way to get between is by cable car or train and the ques are huge. Who designed this? The pathways were very clumpsy as well.OK, to the actual attractions. They were a disapointment. The aquarium consisted mainly of ordinary fishes. They had some exotic stuff, but very little (hammer shark, stingray and octopus) and they were small. The jockey safari consisted of two pandas and two monkeys. The ares they were kept in looked really sad.The emerald trail is just an artificial forrest. The animal sounds are from speakers hidden in the trees.Amazing asian animals consists of two pandas, some small turtles, red pandas(didn't see them), an otter and different goldfishes. The goldfishes was somewhat cool. There were no gators.On to rides:Beacause of all the ques I only had time for the Hair Raiser and the water slide. Both were fun. Slitely shorter and more comfortable wait at the Hair Raiser. Choose your rides carefully 'cause you only have time and energy for a few.The food joints wad not good. The socalled pizza place had one type of pizza, a 3inch veggy pizza. Tried the sandwich joint too, even though it was clearly unsanitary.If you choose to go to Ocean park anyway I recomend buy the ticket at the Admiralty station. That way you skip the enormous ticket que at the gate."

I'd expected more. We watched a Dolphin performance at the Jakarta themepark and we felt that it was much better, in comparison.Food-wise, it was rather expensive, as with all theme parks.

I liked the parent-and-child seats on the carousel, makes sense when you have a toddler with you =) We tried some local street eats such as curry fish balls and HK pancakes at the Old Hong Kong Street (we also bought lots of panda cookies for our little girl who absolutely loved them! This outlet used to retail in Singapore at Central Mall for awhile and we were disappointed when they ended their business in Singapore), it is all good! We all enjoyed the cable car rides, especially the kids who were thrilled to be so high up! The toilets were relatively clean, this is important to me as I am particular about hygiene. The only downer was that some fellow tourists shoved me when I was attempting to alight from the bus to Ocean Park, and I had been carrying my toddler, so we nearly fell."

Another advice is that, probably it is better to visit it during the weekdays (unfortunately, we went on a Saturday, and had to wait for an average of 30 minutes for the cable car ride each way). Overall, had a great time at Ocean Park."

The Parks entrance is very welcoming as is the lower part of the Park, we caught the Cable car to The Summit which is the Ride part of the park fas soon as we arrived, My wife wasn't to keen on the cable car as it's quite high but the view is fantastic.The rides Mmm what can i say ? most are ok but the new Roller Coaster (Hair Raiser) is Shocking, it felt like the cars had square wheels, my son and i love Roller Coasters the bigger the better, but there is something drastically wrong with this one it vibrated so bad that we both came off with headaches !The lower part of the park was very good, the highlight for us was the Aquarium, we have never experienced fish like it, there were so many different types, We ate in the Aquarium with a table right next to the Glass what a view, Great food and very reasonable prices i highly recommend it.Great Park just a shame about the coaster."

To my eyes, one in particular looked really rusty and dangerous. other rides old too, but noticed a new rollercoaster being built. I would say more new/replacement rides are needed here, but still enough to do for a day. Like the pandas. Don't like paying extra for some amusements on top of entry. Don't go at the weekend!!!

Our trip was the morning of December 11, 2011 (Sunday).My friend already told me that a trip to Ocean Park is not enjoyable because of the steep climbs that you have to do. Still, I wanted my son to have the Ocean Park experience, because when I was a kid I had a lot of fun in OP.We bought our tickets from China Travel Service and they are much cheaper than if you purchase from Ocean Park itself. We took the MTR and then a bus. Upon arrival, we exchanged our ticket vouchers for the actual tickets. And off we went inside, people on the entrance are saying \"Welcome to Ocean Park\" but they are not smiling at all. We immediately went to find the dolphin show and had to line up for almost an hour to ride the cable car. Some groups of elderly chinese cut in line and expect everyone to give way because they are old. I mean hey, everyone needs to be fair, they need to wait like the rest of the guests. The cable car ride is ok, we had fun looking at the scenery and we took some pictures.The dolphin show is not impressive at all. It is like the dolphins do not like to obey the trainers at all. I had more fun watching the Ocean Adventure dolphin show in Subic than in Ocean Park Hongkong. The popcorn sold near the dolphin show is a waste of money, it is not popped at all because it is full of hard bits. We like the dried squid more than the popcorn.After a bit of walking, we found the train and much to our dismay there's a lot of people too. Chinese people in Ocean Park do not know how to line up properly! They keep on pushing everyone and some of them even pick their noses in public! Talk about gross!We met 5 nice ladies in the train though. They look very sophisticated and they can speak english. They thought my husband is chinese and i am indian, lol for that one.Lastly, we tried to enter the aquarium although line is long we still went. Again, the super rude chinese elderly kept on pushing us that we got into a fight with them. We decided to leave Ocean Park instead.LIKED----------- Cable car- Musical fountainDISLIKED-------------- RUDE Chinese elderly will push you all the time. They do not care if they might crush the child that you're with. - There is no staff that oversees the line, so these chinese elderly always cut in line and shout rude stuff at you if you don't give them way.OVER ALL IMPRESSION----------------------------------Ocean Park administrators should learn Customer Relations. They should visit HK Disneyland and take notes how it became the happiest place in HK. NOT WORTH THE TRIP especially if you have children. Go to Disney instead.ENTRANCE FEE:Adult - 280 hkdChild - 140 hkd"

We went to Ocean Park on our very first day. So glad, the weather was so supportive. When we entered the place, I knew I wouldn't be looking at theme parks the same way again. Everything was great! The place, services, rides, attractions.. \"The Flash\" was the best ride I've ever tried in my life.There were 2 main areas of attractions in the park. One is at ground level and the other is at some part of a mountain. You can go to the other side either through cable car or through a train. We really had a great time taking pictures that we ran out of time and ended up not trying some of the rides (the roller coaster!). We also had day tickets only that around 7 pm, one of the security guards had told us to go out already (there was a halloween night pass). I would love to go back and try those rides that I have missed.TIPS:1. Bring the map always!2. Don't forget your camera. Documentation should be at its best!3. Water, water, water!4. If you want to start at the exciting rides, you may opt to travel to the other side (mountain) first before going down (we realized this later on..)5. Patience..... You are not the only person in the park."

Get there early too as it is CRAZY BUSY and expect a long wait for exhibits, rides, food, even toilets.... Still it's a definate place you should visit. I found it difficult to find places using the map and be warned this place is full of steep hills. If you have problems walking you may need to rethink your visit or get a wheelchair, although with the amount of people there a wheelchair could be a problem in itself. The panda's were lovely and the night show on the water was mesmorising. The venue itself is not too hard to get to via public transport but I'd recommend a taxi. Leaving will be your problem if you leave upon close as you will be fighting amongst thousands to get back to where you need to go. Still a great experience I say"

My friends and I did the park in about 4 hours without young kids.We didnt do every rise, watch every show so it would be longer if you took more time. With young kids you would want the whole day."

I did not like the way they renovated the aquarium, it seemed smaller now and less exciting, had limited sharks and less big fishes on display. I also missed the golfishes on display, and the flamingos, i just dont know if i did not see where they were, I felt there were less shows and not spectacular.

Nothing spectacular really, only things I enjoyed are the pandas and the 3 roller coaster rides and the tower view which gives you a good surrounding view on top. Other than that, you will definitely need a good pair of walking shoes, a good night sleep and plenty of water as the park is huge and divided into 2 areas where you need to take a cable car or train or shuttle bus to the other part of the park. I would suggest having McDonalds or other food station but not the restaurant as the price are tripled compare to the normal food you get to eat out of the park, unless you feel generous and don't mind paying more.Overall experience was okay, enjoyed it but very tiring due to the walking as the park rides/theater/attractions are quite far apart from one point to another. So beware! You will need to go as early as possible to enjoy the most of it. Travel period 5th of March."

As it is so easy to find your way around in Hong Kong, we caught the underground to Admiral station where we picked up a dedicated bus service (route 629) straight to the park. There was a ticket office for the park in the station and we saved HK$30 each by buying them there. Usual fee is HK$280 each.The park is divided into 2 main parts as it is situated on a mountain. You get the train or the cable car to the other side. The view from the top and the cable car is spectacular as you are on a peninsular so you can see the city and the dramatic coast line and islands. The attractions are on the sides of the mountain and there are escalators joining them to save you having to walk up the steep paths. This makes the roller coasters very exciting as they protrude out over the cliff edge. Some attractions were being renovated but there was still plenty to see and do. For the less adventurous there was the aquarium, the dolphin and seal shows and the pandas and there were nature discovery walks. Take your camera. As extra info, after we passed through security at Hong Kong airport I bought a bottle of water to take on the plane with me, as did many others and they were taken away from us as we boarded. All other airports I have been in allow this."

There is a map in english available at the entrance which details the park layout, it can help in planning your time. The park is very big so make sure to reach early.My suggestion will be to see the aquarium and panda centre in the waterfont section first and take the cable car to summit. Enjoy your time in summit and then come back to the waterfront section by train/cable car and based on the time exlore other areas.The food is a major problem and limited options are there for vegetarians. This is one negative point about the park. So have a nice breakfast before you go.Some rides are awesome (hair raiser, eagle, dragon train, flash etc.). The ocean theatre show is good.I am not too crazy about rides so spent most of the time in the areas which were based on marine life, which I think should not be missed.Overall it is a nice one day trip."

The dolphin and sea lion show at the Summit was good too. Easy to get seats on a weekday's morning. Go on a weekday and when the park just opens - you can walk in to all the rides. Noon/early afternoon are the busiest time with long queues to the cable car and most popular rides. Another planning tip is to check the park's website for which attractions may be closed on the day you are visiting. This is done randomly and you are better off checking to avoid disappointment."

We visited Ocean Park on a fine afternoon at the end of December, so it was during the peak school holiday period and, as expected, there were a lot of visitors there. It was surprising, therefore, that only 4 of the 12 payment kiosks were open at the entrance to the park, which meant that it took an hour to queue to buy a ticket. Once inside, there's plenty of space and it's a typical family-oriented zoo/park of the sort that you can find throughout the World. The Panda enclosure was the main reason that we went and it was good, with sensible viewing arrangements. The aquarium was very good. We weren't there for the rides but the youngsters seemed to be enjoying them. Overall, it's pretty typical of its genre and easy to get to using public transport."

            "review": "Will go again, especially to see the Dolphin and Seal show. We went on a Friday, not on a school holiday day and there were very little crowds- just the right amount of people there. Because we went in February most of the water rides were closed so I would come here in summer again. The wait for rides were 10 minutes and under, which was very good. We arrived at 2pm and had pre bought tickets for HK$235 each (just under 20GBP). The queue moved very fast. As we had no bags to be checked an attendant just scanned in our tickets and we went in. First stop was the aquarium. This was quite impressive, especially at feeding time. Next we went over to the summit side by cable car. The queue was long and took nearly an hour. If you are not afraid of heights then this is recommended as the sights are quite beautiful from here, especially at night on the way back when all the lights turn on. THe summit had most of the more grown up rides. I liked the Hair Raiser ride though it was short. The Dragon ride just bashed my head round a lot. Food here was quite expensive and we ended up snacking a lot instead of buying one big meal. I ate this particularly tasty rice stick near the theatre just before the Dolphin and Seal show. We didn't pay attention to any of the story apart from the middle part when there was a particularly funny act. We just enjoyed the Dolphins jumping out of the water and doing tricks. The rainforest exhibit was also very good and so was the panda exhibit, though the Red Pandas were sleeping. The souvenirs were generally on the expensive side but very cute. I managed to find a whole stand of good quality discounted charms for charm bracelets and necklaces so brought a load back home. We left at 6:30am, just in time to get on a crowded bus back to the MTR station. All in all, it was a good day out. When going there we took the MTR Admiralty Station Exit B. From there is was hard to miss the bus stop as it had a ticket purchasing stall right next to the bus 629 for Ocean Park. We sat on the top deck and loved the great view of Hong Kong from there. We would come here again in the summer for sure."

I'm just glad that we didn't want to go on any of the major rides, because I think we would have been queuing for hours. We managed to get around most of the other attractions though and most importantly, spent about half an hour watching the giant pandas - which was the main reason we went. We really enjoyed the cable car ride - even though it was a fairly misty day and we were packed into the tiny car with another four adults and it was worth queuing for. The Ocean Park Express, which hasn't been open very long, was quite disappointing though. It's an alternative way of reaching the summit instead of using the cable cars and we went back down on it, but it just seemed like a slightly fancy MTR!As I said, we didn't go on any of the other rides, but we still managed to spend about 5 hours doing all the other stuff, so it's a really good day out - even for two old fogeys like us!"

(they don't check a lot) It is impossible to buy something healthy inside the attraction park so unless you want to eat popcorn, hamburger or noodles you might want to put a healthy sandwich and an apple in your backpack.Do go to the big aquarium, it is impressive!!!It is not a bad idea to check how to go their with public transportation.

The only respite was when a show was on and the crowds were less. We didn't buy any food as the queues were too long and they were few and far between.

Hong Kong's Ocean Park is a place where travelers, with friends and/or family can all go. Rides ranging from the child's exciting level Ferris Wheel to the adult's affair with an overloop roller coaster. Of course there are other rides in between those levels.To enjoy it further, hop on to the in-park cable car that will bring you from the bottom of the park, to the top of it. Along the 15-20 minutes journey, enjoy the beautiful landscape that Hong Kong has to offer, away from the office buildings (if you want to see the skyline, head to The Peak instead). Don't forget your cameras too!Currently when I was there, there are some construction works ongoing to expand the park further, fortunately, these construction works won't obstruct visitors in anyway.Lastly, head to the Pandas' enclosures to see the Pandas of China. Be mindful of the rules and regulations while in there, such as no flash photography and loud noises."

The dolphins weren't all that cooperative - perhaps they're bored doing the same thing three times a day.The food from the stalls is simply awful. Takeaway greasy fast food at its worst. Think McDonalds (they are there), but the rest are just as bad.

I didn't know there were pandas at the park. There are 2 exhibits - one inside and one outside with 2 pandas in each location. You are only separated by glass (inside) and a fence (outside). So close. I spent at least an hour at each location then went and explored the park. At the finish, I went back and spent even more time with the pandas. Much much better than the short time you are 'allowed' with the pandas in South Australia. There were lots of other animals (seals and otters very cute) to see but these were my faves.A huge area to cover with lots of carnival rides spread out across the mountain side. To get from one side of the park to the other involves a very high gondola ride. I hate heights but the view was worth it. Construction of new / added attractions hadn't been completed when we were there. There is no easy way to see everything. Escalators are needed. The attractions are built in a spiral. Lots of backtracking. takes up a lot of time. As with all these places - go early.If you aren't into rides, the animals are worth the cost of ticket entry. Enjoy."

Took the train to the summit and would recommend not queing for the cable car first thing. We got to the top where the rides were and it appeared that nothing was actually up and running they were still doing safety checks on most of the rides. I am not a small person and found that I could not ride the mine train and that Hair Raiser was a very tight squeeze - if you were a Western man of over 5ft 10 you would have problems. Felt this was a let down as a lot of Western people are considerably taller than Eastern people. Also when Hair raiser did work we went on it but when coming back into the station to disembark the cars in front had not moved and we were stuck until they could get everyone out. The annoucements were not in English and we had no clue what was going on. We took the cable car down from the top and there was no queue, when we got to the bottom the queue to go up was very very long! The pandas are wonderful and that is what redeemed Ocean Park for me. They are very well looked after and the keepers put out food that encourages the pandas to come down to the front of their enclosures so you get a really good look at them.Ocean Park need to decided whether they are catering for the Western size or the Eastern size and fix it. If you open at 10 then make sure everything is ready to go, it was like a ghost park I expected to see zombies coming out of the hedges!"

Ocean Park is a very big themepark and divided into 2 areas : The waterfront and The Summit. Both has its own attractions with The Summit has more challenging attractions such as Hair Raiser (the giant roller coaster) and Mine Train. We enjoyed getting wet in The Rapids (rubber boat adventure).Those 2 areas connected by cable car and ocean express. Took the cable car and get thrilling by its height and the Ocean Express is a aquarium-like train. In The waterfront area my kids enjoyed its grand aquarium and see the Giant Panda! It was really a lovely experience and we could not see all the attractions in one day trip. Surely we will come back and visit Ocean Park again in the future. If you have your tourist day pass (transportation easy access card) it is entitled discount for the entry fee and it is easy to go there, just take bus no.629 outside Admiralty MTR station."

Am so looking forward to the Polar areas opening this year. Lots and lots of scary fun-rides, if that's your thing. And of course, the cable car ride is a must for any visit: go to the top area by train and return by the cable car, to avoid the rush.

From Aberdeen, we took another bus to Ocean Park. It's a little tricky to get around since most people don't speak English and most signs are in Chinese. For all the trouble we went through, we were rewarded with a fantastic visit here, albeit short. The long slow cable car ride to the top provided a lot of thrill especially after we saw the flimsy towers that held it together. The cars were swaying vigorously but I must say I enjoyed it. A lot of shows were held at the same time so we picked only the ones we were interested in. The dolphin show was as usual tops. The trainers were topnotch with great interaction with the animals."

However, the creative thinking that has inspired the new rides and \"lands\" has given the theme park a sense of direction. Ocean park used to be the best, and only theme park, and they slowly went downhill from there, but when disneyland came to play, ocean park stepped up their game, and this definitely paid off. The new rollercoaster \"the hair raiser\" is absolutely, hair raising. The new aquarium is fantastic, and has you in goosebumps in sheer awe of the creatures in the massive glass tanks. The childrens area is still the same as always, and has been that way ever since I can remember, and it still holds the classic carnival charm. A must-see for all thrill seekers, animal lovers, children and adults alike!"

But, one favorite excursion was a day trip to Ocean Park. FIrst of all, the double deck bus ride to the park was alot of fun with so many beautiful sites along the way. We rode by Repulse Bay (absolutely gorgeous area) and the Stanley Market which was nice as well. Also, Ocean Park was very reasonable --- $30 or so...can't remember exactly. I recommend you ride the roller coaster that goes upside down. It was a lot of fun and not scary at all when you're on it. I haven't ridden a roller coaster in many years but rode this one and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. One more thing, there's ALOT of walking here because the amusements are built into a mountain and are on several different levels. The view from the park is spectacular."

We arrived late morning and the queues everywhere were very long so that wasted a lot of our time - in the end we could only take one ride and caught only the Sea Dreams show!Nevertheless, we still enjoyed ourselves as it was the first time being there for the kids and we stayed till closing time at 9 pm.Our favourite stops were the cable car ride, the aquarium, and the Sea Dreams show. But the most unforgettable moment was when I discovered I dropped my wallet containing all the HK dollars we had as a family! And I didn't realize it till we were about to pay for some stuff we bought - just before closing time.I ran all the way back to where i thought I might have dropped it but was stopped by two security guards who said that the section of the Park was already closed and they could not let me enter. I tried explaining that I lost my wallet but they kept saying that it was closed. Then one of the guards must have suddenly realized what I was saying and described my wallet to me! It turned out that he was the one who picked it up and had sent it to the \"find-and-lost\" department (or that's how he said it).I ran to the place and true enough I found that it was my wallet! Thank God! What a relief! Compliments to the honesty of the security guard! It was not hard to imagine how my family's vacation could have been completely ruined if he did not find it, or if someone else took it and not returned it! That experience will stay in my memory for a looong time to come! Thanks, Ocean Park!Some tips: 1) Go as early as you can! The crowd comes in around lunch time and builds up through the afternoon!2) If you want to catch any of the shows, please go to the venue early (by at least half an hour!) They open the doors right after the preceding show and they allow people to come in to take their seats for the next show - so it's really first-come-first-served!3) Pack your own lunch/dinner if possible - food and drinks in there are expensive!"

What more could you want - huge aquarium, a zoo, smaller niche aquariums with goldfish or jelly fish, dolphins, a huge amusement park, and so much more we didn't even make it to! Some recommendations: buy your tickets online so you can avoid the ticket line. I highly recommend going first thing in the morning (it usually opens at 10:30 a.m.). The park is split into two parts connected by a cable car and an underground train. If you want to avoid lines for rides and everything else, go immediately to the far side of the park. Everyone seems to do the closest side first, so the far side is EMPTY for the first hour or two after they open. We got on all the rides with no (or very short) lines, before everyone else came to the far side of the park. We then did the first part of the park last, which was not such a big deal because the rides with line-ups are mainly on the far side. I also HIGHLY recommend taking the cable car - the views are like nothing else I saw during my time in Hong Kong. Also, as great as the park is, I did not see much food that looked really appetizing, so don't come hungry."

As many people had already comment lots about this place, I will just go straight to the point:Pros- Pandas and Aquariums are spectacular. Cons- Not enough kids rides, no parades (it's about time for a parade), not enough food variety (mostly hotdogs and fast food)For those who wouldn't mind paying for an expensive dinner, do make reservations at the Neptune. It is located at second level of the main Aquarium and you can sit right next to the fishes (separated by glass of course) while you eat your dinner. The setting is perfect, though servings are rather small (I am a 85kg male Asian). I believe I spent around SGD350 for that dinner for my family of four (2 adults and 2 young kids). However the views is what made the dinner worth. Highly reccomended."

The friends I was travelling with were all in their early 20s and had a 'thing' for aquariums. We caught a taxi out there (which took about 5x as long as it should have - handy hint: it should take around 5-10 mins to get there from the Garden Road Peak Tram Terminus). The entry prices were fairly reasonable (around $220 HKD each). The water park itself is enormous and very well serviced - there are lots of attractions, food stalls and (of course) shops.The exhibits were clean and well presented and the animals were simply amazing. My favourites were the pandas! The aquarium was also well worth a look.Finally, it sounds like a typical tourist attraction, but the cable car was absolutely amazing. The views over the bay and towards Hong Kong Island were something I'll never forget.In all, it's not a typical HK experience but it's a great thing to do if you have extra time up your sleeve. The cable car ride alone makes the entire visit worth it!"

Part of the reason was because we were travelling with 2 kids under 5 and 2 senior citizens. The hilly terrain at Ocean Park was a \"killer\" for us. :( We had rented strollers but even pushing strollers up fairly steep hills can be tiring! There were many steps/escalators and it is not easy to negotiate these with strollers. :(The park is also not very well designed as the entrance and exits of rides were not close together. We ended up having to hike back to where we left the strollers and grandparents at the start of the ride! Those of you who have been to Disneyland would know what I mean. It's easier there.The place was also horribly crowded with tourists travelling in big groups...this can be quite intimidating. After we left the park, we counted almost 40 or more tour coaches at the carpark!The Cable car ride was lovely. The Sea animals show was not bad, but the Sealions were better than the Dolphins. The aquariums were nice.We probably won't be going back there any time too soon."

Every thing is in English also, so you can find your way around easily and the staff are very helpful. Even if you don't ask for assistance they come and ask if they can help you find your way. We went with our 15 month old and he was so excited about all the animals that we were going to see. Unfortunately, i found the shows lacked a little. I do understand that the animal trainers are doing well to speak part Cantonese and part English and i get that doing all that while you are looking after an animal and making it perform is no easy feat, but alas after going to an Ocean park in the States or in Australia, i found that this Park fell short.The transport to the park is very efficient and easy to catch which is another plus. Worth it maybe if you are going on some of the rides etc. But we wanted the animal attraction part of it and that's why i am only rating it so."

Ocean Park Express runs every 5 mins, and has a large capacity so the wait time is always always much shorter than the Cable Car. Return from the other side by taking the Cable Car, which is comparatively a shorter line. (Except for 5pm onwards, so if you'll like to minimize queuing time for the Cable Car ride, upon arrival, head straight via Ocean Express train to the other side, enjoy those rides, and then come back to the entrance section. Avoids the mass herds.)"

When Disneyland opened, many predicted this would mark the park's demise. The truth is far from it. In fact, I'd say that OP has gone from strength to strength, upping its game to meet the competition head-on. They have recently opened their Thrill Mountain, which has 3 major rides : Rev Booster, Whirly Bird and The Flash. The first two are relatively fun and easy on the heart. However, it's the Flash which will send your heart racing. It spins you upside down, and you are literally off your seat. When it ended, I had to stop and catch my breath before deciding whether to have another go. That was how intense the experience was. The other ride which we enjoyed was the Rapids. Understandably, with all the new attractions, the older rides like the Abyss, Mine Train etc were not well patronised. The children loved the Dolphin and Sea Lion show, and the scenic cable car ride. We ended the day watching the Symbio light show. It was well worth the wait. Overall, I was impressed by the developments at OP. Would definitely be back because I saw a new roller coaster called Hair Raiser undergoing testing. Yeah!!"

In such a massive park, certain rides are far-flung and walking to them can take a good 10 minutes - it certainly feels like a waste of energy if your kids can't get on the rides!Also, be sure to get to the dolphin/ sea lion show at least 30 minutes in advance if you intend to get a place to sit. We arrived 15 minutes before the 3.30pm show on a weekday only to find ourselves cordoned off from the seats which were filled to capacity! We returned 30 minutes before the 5.30pm show and enjoyed the show. The views from the fringes of the park are stunning and Kodak moments await!"

Since my brother (25 y/o) and my sister (23 y/o) haven't been to a theme park in ages, we all agreed to go to OP as advised by our friend back home. If you're up for the rush and excitement, go to OP and try out their rides. Meanwhile, if you want to reminisce with your favorite childhood Disney characters, Disneyland would be the place for you."

There were no horrendous queues (in the kids area-I believe the adults area was much busier) and our son said he liked it better. There is a mix of attractions and some are better than others but for little kids this place is great. It has a good playground with appropriate rides. The aquarium is impressive. Overall I would go here rather than Disney if you had to choose.The down side was that the food we had wasnt good quality and was very overpriced and in the adult area (the summit) many of the rides were closed which we were unaware of. There are display boards around with information on them and it was possibly on there but I think if you were going as an adult for the rides you should be told this before you fork out the ticket price.........."

Everyone seems to know someone who likes Ocean Park, but I simply cannot understand the attraction, and we have tried on 3 separate occasions as visitors often think they want to experience it. This place is overpriced, dirty, nothing special (with the possible exception of the pandas, but even that falls short of its potential and is quite boring), and the service throughout the park (e.g., at restaurants, such as they are) is very, very poor. If there is an audience for this place, I suspect it is one of two groups: 1) people with very young children who are hard up for entertainment and aren't willing to pay for HK Disneyland or have already been there; and/or 2) teens looking for a venue where they can get away from parental oversight and be obnoxious (particularly true at Halloween). There is some potential here, but most everything is so poorly done, with abysmal service and so filthy (trash everywhere), that it's hard to find the \"bright spots.\" If you miss visiting Ocean Park, the only thing you will have missed is wasting your money. Definitely not worth the visit."

The pandas look so happy and they are so fluffy!- Riding the Nautilus is a must (and much nicer than Disney's!)- The Cable car has some of the best views you can imagine over the bay, sea cliffs and ocean... I never imagined that an amusement could be built in such a topography - a part in a valley and another part in a mountain!- The final show in the main fountain with 3D effects is at the same level or above Disney shows... unforgettable!!- The Halloween party is really daunting and you can ride most attractions in the dark!- And many more to see and do! It makes easily a full day of action and fun.The best part for me was to see the sunset when I was starting the rollercoaster ride... wow!!For sure you will never see amusement parks the same way after you have been to this one..."

I paid HKD 680/person for a privileged pass with dinner at terrace cafe and it was the best decision I made. Privileged pass is a MUST or else you would end up queuing for a long long time (1hr) for each haunted house.They have 8 haunted houses with around 15 shows scattered around Ocean Park. My favorite was Fear Factory and the 3D show. Fear Factory scared the living daylight out of me. And the 3D show, it was more like a 4D show. They have a huge screen in front and below where we stand, each with 3D effect. It felt so real!Overall, they really spend a lot of effort trying to scare you! And it's so fun looking at people screaming, running, and get shocked! hahahaa... Oh and their decorations and costumes are GREAT!! TOP NOTCH!The dinner was a 4-course set meal. I wasn't so keen on it because usually food in theme park isn't all that great. But oh my they proved me wrong. The meal was great. To top it off, the Terrace cafe is located on a hill (cliff) just next to the sea. It is breezy and relaxing. And you get to see HK evening skyline too!So yeah, if you visit HK in October, this should be on top of your list."

More exciting well wishers will greet you with song and dances as you enter the park. What i like most is the cable car that allows you to see the view from above. It will take you few minutes in going to the other side of the mountain. What i regret most is the insufficient time we had to enjoy the different exciting rides. However, my family enjoyed the dolphin show that last for an hour. We had our lunch in the area which could be found easily. This park maintains cleanliness and therefore littering is a BIG NO to them. I love the park and it is good for family bonding. Children will really enjoy the different activities lined up in their lists of undertaking while in the park. They have also introduced the endangered panda bear which they protect most. They have also with them pictorial booths where you could choose from with a fee after the end of the respective tours. One should not forget to buy souvenir items. There are plenty of stores parading within the area."

The park has a lot more to offer aside from its signature rides and shows. Don't miss cable car ride which was an experience all by itself, ocean theatre shows with dolphins and sea lions and the panda adventures were crowd pleasers. For the thrill-seekers there were plenty of rides to choose from: the eagle, abyss, mine train, raging river, the dragon,rapids, the flash and space wheel etc. It seemed like the park has evolved from a foreign-tourist oriented park to a local-tourist oriented park which cater to \"mainland tourist\". The bird show could have been more enjoyable if was in English for tourist to understand but as I have said there were more mainland tourists now than foreign at a ratio of prob 10:1. And it could be crowded and nasty during the peak times. If you value your personal space don't go, if you have small very children, avoid especially the Summit part of the park (there are lots of uphill walking/stairs, althou escalators are available). The Waterfront part is good for the children though, if not crowded. If you don't want pushing and shoving avoid Ocean express too! Food was more expensive than Disney and not that good. There were lots of trees and canopied walks so queuing in the midday sun was tolerable than in Disneyland. And they set-up fans and mist around the parks to cool you down. Still a must go if you haven't been there before."

Once inside, every ride had over an hour wait in the hot sun, often with no shade or relief. Rides were okay -- the one roller coaster that goes out over the bay was pretty cool. Even had to wait a half hour to be seated for lunch in the terrace restaurant. The jellyfish exhibit was very nice and the panda exhibit was also good.

Our 16 month old son loved the aquarium and seeing the pandas and other animals at Ocean Park. We caught the dolphin show at 3.30pm and it was great, packed though! so try and make the 11.30am show for less crowds. We took our seat for the show half an hour before it started and the grand-stand was nearly full already. The dolphin show and all the thrill rides are up the top of the mountain (via the cable car or train) so do these first and then head back down to chill out in the aquarium, panda enclosure etc.My Husband and I took turns going on all the thrill rides - my husband loved the roller coasters. The log ride down the river was a bit boring, just floats around and then has one sheer drop - not really worth it. The ride up the escalator by the entrance to the train to go back down the mountain is awesome - don't miss it!It is a massive park so be prepared for lots of walking. And take an umbrella in case it rains (it is bound to!).

A big sign on entry stated that outside food and drink were not allowed. All bags were given a quick check by staff on entry, we had water bottles and they went in ok. All rides except Ocean Park Tower were open. We went on most rides in the morning, they had minimal to non-existent queues. Mid-afternoon it seemed that bus loads of people arrived and it became noticeably busy, and queues looked long. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of walking around, up and down ramps or stairs. The map wasn't the best to follow but there were signboards with arrows to point you in the right direction. There were plenty of toilets located all around the park. The Pandas were well worth seeing. The aquarium was huge with lots to see. Worth the money for hours of entertainment."

            "review": "Great fun - but wear your walking shoes.. We went to Ocean Park with our two children (aged 11 and 13), and had a ball! On the negative side - the park is getting a bit old; the quality of the surroundings (buildings/paths/gardens etc) was pretty average compared with amusement parks in QLD, Australia; it was a little difficult to get around as it's very hilly; it wasn't that easy navigating from one one attraction to the next.HOWEVER, on the positive side - the rides were great; there were hardly any queues when we went; the aquarium was really good; the dolphin/seal show was fun; the pandas were beautiful; the food outlets were ok (much better than Disneyland); and there seemed to be plenty of staff around to help direct us when we got lost. We booked Ocean Park via a hotel tour - we would not do that again. It took us 3 hours to get from our city accomodation to the park as we had to pick up people from other hotels and then, the bus made us wait for nearly an hour at a jewellery manufacturing place (this had not been on our itinary!) A much better way to go to Ocean Park is to get a MTR train to Admiralty Station, then catch the 629 bus to the park.I have read a couple of reviews about other \"tourists\" being rude and pushing in front of you - we experienced this too - my advice is to learn how to stick your elbows out and push back!ONE WARNING - Ocean Park does not want you to take your own food in - your bags (only) are searched at the entrance.Our children said that this was the best thing they did in Hong Kong! We wish we could have spent more time here."

You have to travel up and down many esculators and a cable car and train to get around.The rides are not safe, with many not having saftey straps to hold you in.We set out to the park on a cloudy day, by the time we arrived it had started raining. We paid to get in and then found out that only three rides were operating and they cancelled the shows. We should have been informed of this at the entrance, because we would not have paid to enter. A waste of nearly $700. We left after at lunchtime and it was pouring with rain, yet ques of people were paying to enter and not being informed of the lack of working rides and shows.Also we brought rain jackets for $30 each at a gift shop in the park, only to find a staff memeber selling them for $20 at one of the working rides, not impressed.Staff were unhelpfull and could not always correctly direct you. I can understand why other reviews had said that they only had time to do a few rides, because the distance between rides is quite long and if you are walkiing between rides and the waiting in a long que, then little would been acomplished."

The original theme park in Hong Kong.Wasn't really interested in wasting a day on this holiday visiting a theme park, so we didn't.After learning there was an AQUARIUM & PANDAS here, we popped in for a couple of hours when doing the south of the island, between Stanley & Aberdeen.It cost about \u00a325 (GBP) to get in, cheaper than those in the UK, and had so much more than what we were used to.AQUARIUMLargest & most amazing I've ever seen in my LIFE! Done the only way China could do it - bigger and better than anywhere. The highlight was the reasonably priced restaurant which overlooked the largest viewing gallery I had seen. Perfect for a lunch.PANDASComing from the UK - these were the first pandas we had ever had the chance to see... WOW! So impressed, they loved playing up. Recommend going around feeding time.2 were in 1 enclosure, 2 in another.CABLE CARGreat way to see some coast line, as well as getting from one side of the park to the other on the peninsula. Recommend getting the cable car 1 way, and the train back.THEME PARK RIDESStandard theme park, we only went on the 1 ride, as we were short on time - but I'd say it was well laid out with good maps. If we had more time, we would have spent more there.BEWAREPublic transport to/from is a bit of a nightmare and you need to be a bit savvy with the busses. Takes a bit of planning, luckily we had a good guide book to hand.OVERALLIf you're holidaying as a family, take a day out to do it, otherwise, if you like aquariums or pandas - definitely worth dropping in."

            "review": "Waste of time. Now, we all know that in amusement parks you spend much more time standing in line to take a ride then actually on the ride, but this park has devised new methods of wasting your time.The paths between the rides are long and confusing. For example: let's say you want to go down with the cable car from the summit and you managed to get to the Exit of the cable car, how do you get to the Entrance? Well you need to go down the hill a few hundred meters. Turn left, even though you can see that the cable car is on the right. Make a loop under a bridge. Pass a few intersections some have signs some not and then go back up the hill an additional few hundred meters.Another example: you can go down an escalator on the back side of the summit to access a few rides. The escalator going up brings you to a different place then where you went down. Now you need to spend more time finding your way back to where you wanted to go.Another way of wasting your time is the long lines for the food stands, which are way understaffed. If you want to see the dolphin show \u2013 be there 30-45 min before show time or you will not be able to get in.Gave Ocean park 3 stars and not 2 since my daughter said she did have fun, and that I was just disappointed that my favorite ride (the rapids) was closed due to typhoon warning.Tip: Check if there were any typhoon warnings before you go to ocean park. Some of the rides will be closed. Even if actually the weather feels fine."

This place is absolutely fantastic. It is highly recommended to start as early as you can. We took Bus 629 (HKG10.60) at the Admiralty MTR, and reached Ocean Park by 9.30am. There were already people on the queue at the entrance.When we got in, we took the cable car and went up to The Summit to start with the adventurous rides. The cable car ride was fantastic; it offered great view into the surrounding ocean. For those who prefer not to take the cable car, you can opt for the train ride. We were glad that we started with the adventurous rides as we basically did not have to queue. By late morning, the queues to the rides were already building up and some took more than 10-15 mins.Some of our favorites are The Abyss, The Dragon and The Flash - they are all super adrenaline pumping!We took the cable car downhill and then went to see the pandas, took the merry-go-round and visited the Grand Aquarium. We spent quite some time at the Souvenir Shop; as there are so many interesting buys. We missed the crowd favorite - The Hot Air Balloon as the waiting time by noon was over half an hour! Food is aplenty; with many restaurants (which can be quite crowded) as well as food stalls.Overall, it was really a very good visit."

We found Ocean Park easy to get to by MTR then a bus direct to the Park, bought the Ocean Park tickets as exited MTR (at Admiralty MTR station Exit B) as this included the bus fare. The buses left from outside the station. At the park we visited the Panda habitat which was very interesting but I felt the pandas were a bit frustrated with their enclosure - though apparently they have more space away from the public viewing area. The roller coasters were great fun - try the Dragon and the Wild West Mine Train (great view) for thrills and laughs. We also loved the excellent aquarium and the cable car ride which gave us a great view over Deep Water Bay. We went early in the season and fairly early in the day so the park wasn't too crowded. An excellent day or half day out with something for everyone."

Saw various women managing it in heels and astounded how they could make it through the day.The park is split in two, with a cable car (shut when we went) or shuttle train to take you from one side to the other, the near side having the aquarium and panda exhibits, and a childrens area, and the far side concentrating mainly on rides. This splitting of the park maybe made it less great for larger groups with persons of verying ages, as its not great for splitting and wandering, but really geography dictates this. The far side of the park also has great views of the bays of the south of the island.The main problem of the park was that many people (I'm informed mainly from the mainland) have no concept of waiting or standing in line and would often push or barge in front of you. They would then be incredulous when you stood your ground and wouldn't allow them to barge past. The park have signs up \"strictly prohibiting\" this, but so far as I could tell nothing was ever said."

I felt the ocean park was way better than disneyland, but im guessing thats because we were all young adults and the rides in ocean park were more appropriate. The ocean park is easy to get to, just take MTR to admiralty, and then take the bus, i dont recall the number, no worries there are clearly visible signs in english, and you'll even find a booth next to the bus stop for tickets. The park is a bit confusing though, and we found the map to be very vague, and got lost a couple of times. Best option is to follow the direction boards along the way. Most of the area is covered with trees especially when you cross over to the other side, either by underground train or cable car (which seems awesome but was closed when we went). At the entrance side you can go see the pandas, the aquarium, and other attractions we didnt have time to cover. We went to the other side, where there were numerous rides for ones adrenaline rush!It is a bit hilly, even though there are escalators to take to to different places. The view was magnificent too, there will be many points to overlook hong kong. Also, make sure you go see the pandas, it was a much better experience than trying to squeeze your way in the beijing zoo. Set aside a full day, because you will walk a lot, and there are really a lot of activities. A tip, if you wish to see the dolphin show, get there REALLY early. We got there 15min before, and it was fully packed( and it was a big sitting area), so buy lunch and go save yourself a seat."

Rare to have clear, non-smoggy summer days in HK, but when there is one, it's a good day to bring the kids to Ocean Park. Much bigger than HK Disney, too. The aquarium is one of the coolest attractions with sharks, rays, tuna, etc, swimming around and above you as you walk through the cavernous rooms. Dolphin show is narrated in Cantonese, Mandarin and English, and one needs to get there at least 1/2 hr early to get the seats in the shade. Roller coasters are mild/medium, with The Dragon by the waterfront being the best they have. Cable car ride up and down the mountainside are not for the acrophobic, and the view is fantastic. Unfortunately, Ocean Park gets really crowded with rude tourists from the mainland who unabashedly cut the lines at every opportunity. Panda viewing areas get pretty crowded, too. Again, watch for pushing and shoving by mainland tourists. The park employees are not effective in combatting that behavior.. it's just too rampant. Patrons are left to fend for themselves. It's to the point where we feel really sorry for the HK natives who have to deal with the surge from the north. Other than that, our day there was really fun."

            "review": "Not for the very young, very old or infirmed visitor, but go!. Ocean Park is not Disnyland and is not trying to be Disnyland. If you understand this, then read on, please. I was a single, black female with dreadlocks, traveling through Hong Kong last November, 2010. I had accompanied my husband on his business trip, so I was alone almost 90% of the time. I am writing this review after reading all the \"bad\"reviews of this park. I noticed a theme, so I thought I would add my opinion and experience to the mix. I took the MTR to the bus depot where I bought my ticket for entry to the park. Like many attractions in Hong Kong, the shuttle of buses out to Ocean Park was harried, chaotic and crowded. I was born and raised in NYC, so this did not bother me at all. I got a map at the entrance to the park (as my husband had taught me to do - we never used maps for our \u00a0parks in NY). I immediately knew I wanted to go to the side where the \"adult\" rides were located, which meant taking the tram over and across the park. This line or queue took about 45 minutes, but it moved a few feet on a regular basis. It was a Thursday, mid-day (11:00ish or so, I think) and very warm and sunny (around 36c). I appreciated the warmth of the day; it's part of visiting this part of the world! I boarded my tram with two young Asian girls (in their 20's, I guess) who quickly helped me take pictures of myself in exchange for pictures I took of them together. When I hopped off the tram, and this hopping is the way to get on and off, by the way, they went one way down a hill, only to circle back to me to help me orient myself to the map and take a picture of me in front of the tram. I later met a pair of girls from Australia and a couple from England, with whom I later rode back with over the tram, she being five months pregnant, couldn't ride many of the rides on that side and they were headed for the Panda exhibit (I would follow them to the red Panda exhibit and then lose them at the carousel). I love roller coasters and tried to ride all the fast rides; it was a disappointing experience, \u00a0but only because I really like my rides fast and scary (think Busch Gardens in Tampa, FL \u00a0or Universal Park). I did not eat at this park as I am trying to be a vegetarian and also avoid fast food. All the restaurants for food looked crowded anyway. I agree about places to sit and in the shade. I noted that the locals brought their food to these benches and parked it there, hogging all the cool spots! I spent my time in the cool of the gift shop and powered down that way. By the time my hunger and fatigue took over, I had put in four hours in the park and two bags of gifts to bring back. The shark aquarium was not worth the pushing, shoving and poor visibility. I had never seen an exhibit of jellyfish, so I spent more time in that cooler, calmer atmosphere (fewer crowds in there too).\u00a0Every theme park that I have visited, has had one or some of its attractions either under contraction or closed for maintenance. To describe this as a negative is to see the glass as half empty. I must say I loathe crowds, so if I found this park a pleasurable experience, it is because I left my \"expectations\" in my hotel room and ventured out with \"wonder\" and \"excitement\" as my companions. I wish more travelers packed more of their tolerance and patience then shirts and shoes. TIP: The park is slapped onto a side of a mountain (which gives you those fabulous views from the tram), but the hills don't disappear when you touch land again.\u00a0"

We even rode on the same rides over and over again due to no lines.

We wanted lunch but Didnt see signages for any restaurant. We saw a family with a mcdonalds bag but their directions didn't help, we couldn't find it. The only thing we enjoyed here was the view from the cable car ride up. We left the park without seeing even ONE attraction. Because of the queues. If you don't have older people and kids, and have an incredible stamina, monk like patience and desire to get sun burnt, then go. If not don't bother. Instead go to Disneyland, which was wonderful. D read my review on that."

We had to wait in line for 1-2hours per ride which meant we only got to go on a few rides throughout the day. On top of that, we found the other patrons at the park some of the most rudest people ever encountered - pushing in every chance they get. When complained to park staff about this, they simply ignored us. Food is nothing special, attractions are nothing special either."

Spare one day for this place and you will not regret. The panda, dolphin & sea lion show is amazing. The different fishes in its aquarium is breath taking. The rides are superb. There is a ride called The abyss which gives you the experience of free fall. Food options are limited and water is much more costlier here than local market. At night, the different colored musical fountains are beautiful to watch after a tiring day. You will spend 2-3 hours walking around. The people here are more friendly & helpful.

I am not a fan of park rides and initially wasn't going to go on this outing, but the kids checked the internet and said us \"olds\" would really like it there, so off we went. We were going to catch the shuttle but ended getting a taxi (needed 2 for the 7 of us), and glad we did. The taxi took the scenic route from the hotel - a little fast to take any photos, but a very interesting trip. We arrived early and found out they didn't open till 10.00 - it was then an almighty rush to get in the gates - if you go to any asian countries you will find they always jostle to get to the front and get there first!!!!The first exhibit we went into was the aquarium and it was fantastic there is no other word. It contained all manner of sea life, was very well set up so that everyone could see everything (even though there were a lot of people there) - all ponds were well marked so you knew exactly what you were looking at.Next was the Panda enclosure - the two that were in there were playing coy, but we did manage to get quite a good look at them after a short wait.It was an extremely hot day when we were there o stopped for a cold drink and to allow our 14 month old grand daughter to have a nap before continuing on.We took our grand daughter on a little kiddies ride which she totally loved and also in a water game, not sure if she or her Mum and Dad enjoyed that more!We then decided to take the cable car to see the remainder of the Park. We didn't realise then that the rest of the park was actually on the other side of the mountain and really \"around the corner\". Got onto the Cable Car and it was a fantastic trip - there are around 240 cars taking you the 1.5 ks to the other side - it was a little scary when the cable cars stopped mid stream.By the time we got there we were all starving so elected for a quick bite before exploring - just the traditional chinese type food. The kid wanted to go on a couple of rides - us adults weren't all that interested, so we waited at the end for them. The wait for almost all the rides was at least 40 minutes which is a bit long in the heat of Hong Kong, but at least they were free, so I guess not worth complaining.This part of the park is literally on the side of the mountain and there are huge escalators to get you up and down the mountains (thankfully!!!), so we had a bit of a look around whilst we were waiting. We also saw a reasonably large monitor lizard and I am sure there are heaps of them wandering around. Next was the roller coaster and again around a 40 minute wait, but where we needed to wait gave us a fantastic view back to Aberdeen and the Harbour there and also out to some outlying islands - great photo opportunities!We had been at the park for quite a few hours and were going to head back when we realised there was another very large aquarium with seals, so stopped to investigate that and saw a show as well, which was really good.By now it was getting near to the last cable car back down the mountain - two of our party had gone off to find another ride so we arranged to meet them at the cable station - we almost missed the last car!The view back down the mountain was sensational and also gave a great view over that side of the Park as well.So despite the fact that initially I didn't want to go, I had an enjoyable day and glad the kids convinced me to go."

The park has certainly got bigger and has got more animal attractions, more restaurants and more rides but overall I felt let down and disappointed.We had read on the foruums that it was best not to go on the weekend and to go early so we left very early and went on a weekday. However getting a bus from Admiralty was a joke - the queue literally went right out of the bus station and round two street corners! So we got a taxi instead. When we entered the park it was packed and it was very hot. Standing in lines for up to two hours with small children in sweltering heat isn't fun! It would be great if there were some cool, airconditioned, places on the summit side of the park but there are very few, if any, so park visitors are left to melt in the heat. The Panda enclosure (waterfront side) is great because it is nicely cooled - ironically the owners of Ocean Park care more about the comfort of the pandas than about the comfort of the park's paying visitors!However, the biggest travesty about Ocean Park is that Waterworld was bulldozed to facilitate the expansion of the Waterfront. Waterworld was a series of open-air swimming pools and slides and was great fun and a great way to stay cool in the hot weather. For some inexplicable reason, this amazing resource was scrapped and what has replaced it is a pale shadow of what was there before.I'm sure many first-time visitors to Ocean Park will enjoy themselves. But as someone who visited when it was in co-existance with the wonderful Waterworld, I cannot help but feel sad and disappointed that shortsightedness prevailed leaving a park that really is not as good as the Ocean Park / Waterworld I visited as a child in the late 1980s"

Ocean park is one of the older theme park in HK, however, with kids who are under 10 years and personally interested in rides, this place is THE place to go in HK. Kids love this place as there is many different things they can do. The park is over 2 levels. The lower level has shows and rides for kids. The new aquarium is a great attraction along with the panda. Reaching the upper level is through cable car and an breathtaking journey. Its about 2 km long and takes 8 minutes. View is excellent. The upper level and some of the most thrilling rides. The abyss, mine train as really scary. People with light heart should not take it. Flash is equally risky. In terms of stuff for kids, the dolphin show should not be missed. 5 dolphins and the syncing between them in a must see. Finally, dont miss the light, fire, water show at the end of the day at lower level. This is really nice. Quick suggestions: There is no water fountain and water is priced expensive. Carry water if you need lots of it. Also, like any other theme park, be ready to walk a lot and stand in queue. Overall, I have been there twice and still not experienced all rides. Ideal to take the annual pass if you live in HK."

It is bigger, more excitement (as there are a lot of extreme rides) and that it is a jack of all trades since it is both for adults and for children.However, it is only until 5pm so there are no fireworks like disneyland--> but who cares about fireworks if you want excitementGoing here is easy, you can ride the 629 bus from Admiralty station --> it will go directly to ocean park.Foods are not allowed inside, they are checking it but I don't know why they did not check my bag full of chips and water! haha!And... don't go here when it is summer in HK, IT IS REALLY HOT, unless you love the sun. go for it.

Admission Fee: HKD 280 for adults, half price for children age 3 and above. Enjoyed the spectacular views of marine life at the Grand Aquarium, in particular the Manta Rays and Sharks gliding above one's head. The Panda Habitat was not as impressive, with only one Giant Panda present when we visited. Then we took the scenic 20-min. Cable Car ride up to the nearby mountain. The Rapids Descent Ride was fun -- be prepared for a wet experience from the sprays and also from playful adults using water cannons to shoot each other! The Dolphin Show was fairly standard, apart from the inclusion of Sea Lions. Be there early to secure the shady seats! And we found it convenient to patronize the food stalls located right at the Dolphin Show. Finally, we visited the interesting Chinese Sturgeon exhibit, where the air-conditioning provided a welcome respite from the hot sun.

We went to Ocean Park primarily to see the Pandas and my hubby wanted to ride the rollercoaster We arrived as soon as the park opened, caught the 107 bus from Hung Hom and were there in about 20 minutes. We waited in line for the cable car to the other side of the park for over an hour but it was worth the wait, the views were amazing. On arrival to the \"theme park\" side of the park we quickly got in a couple of rides before the lines got too long. The Mine Train Rollercoaster was fun for the kids but is certainly not a thrill ride. Then we did the River Rapids and got really wet which was great because it was so hot. By the time we had done these two rides it was about 1pm so we quickly had some lunch and went in search of the Dragon Rollercoaster which is the only reason my hubby came. Found it....closed for maintenance until 4pm and it was only 2pm. The kids were starting to wane by this time so we filled them with isotonic water and did the pirate ship, an oldy but a good ride for the kids. It was so crowded and hot that we decided to give the rollercoaster a miss and go back down to see the Pandas. No lines for the cable car on the way back so a quick trip and an ice cream and then straight to the Panda enclosure. We arrived at the perfect time and were right at the front waiting for the Pandas to come back out and we were not disappointed. The only annoying feature of this is that so many people were using the flash on their cameras, it really takes away from the whole experience.We dropped into the aquarium on the way out...this would be absolutely wonderful if they actually could limit the number of people in there. It was just so crowded that we ended up just walking straight through without seeing anything because there were so many people at every window you could not see anything and yes...you guessed it...they were using their flash again.Though it was really crowded, the lines were long and it was hot, hot, hot....the kids say that this was the best day out that we had in Hong Kong.

Not sure how I should react to the behavior I have experienced at the McDonalds food stand at the peak of the Ocean Park. My family along with a nephew and a niece visited Ocean Park on July 13; we were at the summit area waiting in line to purchase food at the McDonalds food stall. There were many big red umbrellas providing shade for people who are lining up to purchase food. I was there waiting to purchase ice cream cone for the kids. As the weather forecasted for the day called for frequent heavy rain, the sunny sky suddenly turned into cloudy, and the heavy rain soon followed. At the point when I reached to the register to get the ice cream cones, the heavy rain started to fall. People at the waiting line are scrambled and squeezed closer under the red umbrella. My wife and my 10 years old son and the 5 years old nephew were among the crowd hiding from the rain under one of those read umbrella, they were waiting for the ice cream cones that I just purchased at a price that are 4 times more expensive than that in the city. After I passed the ice cone to them, I noticed that a worker from McDonalds holding an umbrella came out and started to close all of the Red umbrella while people are still hiding from the rain under it. After she had closed all of the umbrella and forced out all the people to other place to hide from the rain, she moved on to closed the last umbrella of which my wife, my son and my nephew was under it, having the ice cream cone that we just purchased. She told my wife to get away from there and go hide somewhere else. I was really mad and amazed about what and why the workers at the McDonalds would do such a thing. It seems the park is not that courteous to provide rain shelter for the visitor, not sure if they are there trying to sell more rain coat or not. I would expect the park is there to provide a fun and enjoyable experience for the visitor, but the behavior I have observed gave me a displeasure experience. Coincidently, the ocean park worker at the game stand across the McDonalds started yelling \u201cGet you rain coat for $49 here, we have rain coat available!!!\"Overall, the Ocean Park is a fun place to visit, but the place does not provide enough facilities and areas for visitor to deal with the rainy weather. There are not many areas in the park that the visitors can hide from the rain. Even the food court area do not have a rain proof roof, you will have water leak while you are sitting at the table trying to enjoy the expensive foods."

I also expected it to be busy so we made every effort to get there early and in fact arrived about half an hour before the park opened. We took the bus from Admiralty and bought our park tickets at Admiralty which worked fine. We decided to do the rides part of the park first and headed off on the cable car which is worth doing just for the view. As we went on our first ride the heavens opened and we got absolutely soaked with rain. What I hadn't expected was that if it rained some of the rides closed. We bought hot dogs for lunch but there wasn't a huge amount of choice apart from fast food. The area for lunch was very crowded but we did find a table which we shared with a party from mainland China. We then went back to the lower part of the site which is more like an upmarket zoo. The pandas were great and so were the goldfish display and the large aquarium."

Ocean park is like that... the park is plit into two halves, one, the entrance side, is chock full of natural attractions, panda bears, aviaries, an amazing aquarium and wonderful nature walks along with good food, some great shows (a high diving show - wonderful!) and lots of childresn attractions (though these are of a lesse quality). The other side of the park, an amazing cable car ride away, is really a world apart. A series of second rate county fair type attractions like a small ferris wheel or a terror drop, but totally over-crowded and to spread out, involving long treks int the heat between them and LONG queues. (and really, the rides are not the type to appeal to a theme park junkie -- I like my adrenaline rides - but this was no 6 flags...) We may also have visited on abusy day as the queues were ridiculous and a lot of the facilities were overloaded such as overflowing toilets and sold out stalls etc.My advice would be to spend the day on the nature side. Seeing pandas up close and the wonderful aquarium and shows could take all day when you know the other side is not really worth it (apart from the cable car there and back - great, and a lovely seal exhibition where you can see them above AND below water).So definately worth a visit to see the nature based activities and a great cable car - but dont cut your visit to the entrance side short thinking you're missing out on the other side of the park - you're not."

We saw the dolphin show and were disappointed, as there is no comparison to Sea World in San Diego or Sea World in Gold Coast of Australia both are world class and Ocean Park was mediocre at best.Worth the visit - only if you have time to spare."

An An and Jin Jin, the two pandas lent by the PRC seemed very bored by the whole affair and by the behaviour of their compatriots. The rest of the park was well-done attraction park fare but the ecological message seemed to clash with the more commercial aspects. This is no Singapore Zoo, but would still be a fun time for a family or group of friends."

(I posted this initially as a reply to someone on the forum, but I thought it might help someone who doesn't go on there)On our first trip, when we asked a couple of young adults (Hongkongers) whether we should go Disneyland or Ocean Park, they first said both. But when we pressed further for only one, they all said Ocean Park in unison. It is very much a Hong Kong landmark.There are not only rides but also animal conservation messages in the form of enclosures and the animal show. Animals being cooped up makes me sad though.My favourite rides has to be the Mine Train (roller coaster). I'm not a fan of roller coasters, but this was incredibly fun (I close my eyes and scream in absolute fear) and everyone who took it love it! You can see the joy on their faces after the ride. Tip: take the underground train (Ocean Express) located within the park to get to the hilltop rides first thing you arrive in the morning. You can go see the pandas first at the enclosure nearby of course. There are less people and you have more energy to take the rides. Once you are done, take the cable car ride back down to the waterfront where there are numerous attractions (panda enclosures, aquarium, kiddie rides) as well. This way, you avoid the insane crowd (many of them tour groups) that surge to the hilltop rides later in the day. Just look at the cable car queue when you arrive back at the waterfront to know how insane it can be.They disallow food to be brought in, but we managed to smuggle in some.Lots of stairs."

Our group varied in age from 6 to 50+ and all were entertained well for a whole day out. Tips:Buy your tickets down the MTR for 10% discount.There is a LOT of walking involved so it pays to start by grabbing a map and planning your route - the signposting could be improved! Drink lots if you go during an extreme heat warning day. Go early before the tour groups - start out in the morning so you don't experience the nasty crowds (and its cooler!)Ocean Park has undergone a redevelopment over the last few years and new displays are more eco-friendly in approach. Start with the pandas in the outdoor enclosure for a truly moving experience. The aquarium and goldfish display are also excellent, as are the jellyfish (though they are tricky to find).Food is average but its probably hard to accommodate all tastes. Prices seemed reasonable. You can bring in your own and no one searched our bags (unlike Disney).Lots of reviewers seem to draw comparisons between Disneyland and OP. I don't think its a fair comparison. This park was the highlight of my entire HK trip, as its REAL. If you want an 'amusement park' please go to one. We only did one ride at OP; the Raging Rapids, which had us soaked and laughing for the next hour. People who complain about the price should try adding up the likely cost of all the rides, gondolas etc they go on. If you went on a gondola or to an aquarium in US or NZ you would pay at least 2/3 the total price for a day at OP all inclusive, so in my books its exceptional value, despite us not doing most rides.Would I return? Absolutely."

You will have to pay HK82 for a lunch box (served on a plate), which would have normally cost HK30. Bottled=water is HK16 and there are no drinking fountains anywhere so you would have no choice but to pay up and for this so-called non-profit theme park. The dolphin show also lacks lustre as there are only 4 dolphins and they did not perform many acts either. The attractions were very crowded and the workers seeemd unenthusiastic as well. The only saving grace for my visit was the bathrooms, which were kept relatively clean for the sheer number of people - thank goodness!!By the way, please do something for the poor croc - it really looked pathetic small for the poor reptile!!I cannot say this is any better than Disneyland except for a larger space and more rides...Here you go again, rides.."

Everything was organized except that they lacked food stalls, restaurants, etc. to feed the park visitors. We were not able to have lunch and decided to leave earlier than planned, foregoing the park rides. The lines to the less than 6 food stalls were snakelike & the wait was about 45 minutes. The other stalls only sold water & drinks because the hotdogs/fried chicken/sandwiches, etc were sold out. yes, they had hotdogs on display on the stall near the balloon area but it was for display only. the bakery had sweets and most of the bread were sold out, we wanted to eat lunch. By the time we decided to dine at the Jellyfish Restaurant (about 2:30PM), it was closed : (I hope the park management will provide more food stalls or fast food/cafeteria where people have a choice of food & seating areas.

It's a very old attraction and the infrastructure tells its ageI can accept that the shows were conducted in Cantonese (with a bit of English and Manfarin thrown in) but felt it would have catered better to the sizeable foreign visitors had it been contacted in English (and have Cantonese phrases thrown in)Great day out for the whole family young and oldTip: Start with a cable car ride to the summit and make your way down to the waterfront past mid-day. Go for the earliest theatre show (only 1 at summit) and finish the rides while the crowd has yet to arrive. Make your way to the waterfront after lunch and catch the remaining shows and see the giant aquarium before ending the day with the pyrotechnics show late eveningOverall, you get what you paid for and some improvements when renovations are complete should make it even better"

But I think Oceanpark is better than Disney land cause there is alot of Disney world that I've visited and Hong Kong Disney actors are not genuine.The souvenirs are all a repeat and a bit more expensive and the rides are nto as fun as Ocean Park. Must plan where you want to go first cause there is an uphill and the ground area but both are good. And heard there is an upcomign new zone too!"

The highlights for us were the Pandas, the aquarium and the jellyfish. You have to be pretty fit to get around as there are a lot of hills to climb so plan your route carefully.Our day was partially spoiled by large groups of very rude elderly Chinese, each group wearing different coloured baseball caps and being led by a person with a flag. They barged their way around the park elbowing you out of the way to see an attraction and conversed by screaming at each other. All in all a good day out and the grandchildren enjoyed it."

They also have Giant Panda's and a great display of Gold Fish. Plenty to do for a day visit with a cable car that takes you from one side of the Park to the other. My 80 year old Mum even went on the log ride and the Mine roller coaster. Price was good value for money approx $35aud per adult.

Heaps of buses to take you there, one double decker bus comes approx every 2 minutes or so.Atmosphere: Lively, lots of people we went on a monday so there was alot of people but i dare not go on a weekend, you would be queuing up for ages at the attractions. We were basically the only westerners there but most of the staff were able to communicate in english.Food: Limited to junk, very poor, McDonalds was the only thing palatable however you would need to be in the line for at least 15 minutes. Rides: Queuing up for 10- 15 minutes and then the ride is over in less than 1 minute. However exciting whilst youre on them. Be prepared to wait. using the rides is included in the initial price of $250HK per adult.Animals: Definatly go see the Seals, Pandas, Aquarium. We were unable to get into the arena as it was full to capacity. So thumbs down to that, as we were especially looking forward to looking at the dolphins.This park is quiet a trek, so do not even attempt to wear high heels to this park. I saw hundreds of women wearing them and i felt their pain, i was wearing flats and my feet were sore. Also be aware of the disgusting stench for fried/grilled korean squid which wofts around the park, no offence unless you like eating and smelling that! Alot of merchandising shops after each attraction, obviously one of the ploys to get you to spend more money. At $250HK (~33AUD/USD) an adult its a \"cheap\" (compared to australian attractions which start at $50AUD per adult) day out, quiet fun for me as i went on alot of rides, however my partner was bored and cranky after walking around for 5 hours."

The park has sealife, wildlife, rides for all levels of adrenalin, fantastic scenery (the cable car was my favourite part). There are cute souvenirs everywhere, better to get them at the end of the day to avoid carrying them around and stuffing them into those trays when you go on rides.

The best thing about the park is #1) the summit portion of the park where you can have a gorgeous view of the outer islands and beaches. #2) the gold fish display.If you should decide to go to the park anyway, absolutely avoid going to the Terrace Cafe right next to the tram station at the top of the park. DO NOT let the view it offers suck you into eating there. I ate there today and the service was non existent. I had to flag the waiter to query where our food was and when it arrived it was cold as though the food had been left in the kitchen and the staff just didn't bring them out to my table. Would have saved some good money had I just bought some food from a food stand.Did I mention how crowed and stuffy the park was?

Ocean Park's name led me to expect a theme park similar to Wet N Wild on Australia's Gold Coast, but this is more like Sea World.It's an enjoyable day out, but be prepared to walk a lot as the pathways are quite meandering and you often need to retrace your steps to get to the different attractions.The animal exhibits are the clear highlights and the park is worth visiting just for these. The rides and other attractions are merely filler in comparison.The pandas are incredible to watch and the park manages them very well. By cleaning out the enclosures regularly and hiding bits of food, they make sure the pandas stay animated and entertaining for the crowd.The sealions are another highlight, especially at feeding time when for a small fee you can throw pieces of fish to them. Great fun for the kids! The Sea Jelly Spectacular is also well worth a look, although not recommended if you suffer claustrophobia as it gets quite crowded.The admission fee, food and souvenirs are relatively cheap compared to those at Australia's theme parks.The rides are much more teen to adult than those at Hong Kong Disneyland (which is aimed at younger children), with a couple of rollercoasters and other thrill rides, plus the cable car which runs between the upper and lower sections of the park. For those who prefer not to be suspended that high in the air, there is also an enclosed train which runs between the sections.Worth a visit, but one day will be plenty to see everything here."

They have their own wildlife conservation foundation, guests can support this by giving donation into the box placed strategically in various exhibits and animal shows. BookingBooking a ticket can be done easily online through http://oceanpark.com.hk Tickets are also available for walk-in purchase either at park entrance or at bus 629 stop at Admiralty (accessible via Admiralty MTR exit B along Drake Street outside Lippo Center). Annual pass is also available, but for tourists, 1 day pass is just right. Getting thereThe easiest is to catch Citybus 629 that runs from a bus stop at Admiralty directly to Ocean Park entrance (both main entrance and Tai Shue Wan entrance). It costs HKD10.60 and payable by cash (exact change as bus driver does not give any change) or Octopus Card. Animal ShowsThere are at least 3 animal shows which guests can watch during their visit. The Ocean Theatre shows skillful dolphins playing with their trainers. Sea lions also take part in the shows. Selected guest are chosen to interact with these animals. Show is narrated in both English and Cantonese. Emperor of the Sky is an animal show about birds. Too bad much portion of the show is only narrated in Cantonese so it's hard to catch up on what's going on. Whisker's Theatre shows another sea lion show which is dedicated for little kids. Animal ExhibitsAnimal exhibits are scattered on both lower part (main entrance) and upper part (Tai Shue Wan entrance). In the lower part, one can see Giant Panda exhibit and Amazing Asian Animals is home to more giant pandas, red pandas, goldfish, otters, and a gator (yes, I can only spot 1 gator there, but they do care to put it as an attraction) as well as small bird exhibits next to Emperor of the Sky Theatre. In the upper part, guests can enjoy more marine-life exhibit such as sea lions at Pacific Pier, jelly fish at Sea Jelly Spectacular, sturgeon fish at Yangtze River Expedition, more fishes at Atoll Reef, and some birds at the Aviary. RidesIn the lower part, one can enjoy SkyFair, a balloon ride similar to Characters in Flight at Downtown Disney, Orlando but the admission is inclusive in your ticket, a Sea Life carousel, and bunch of kiddie rides at Wisher's Harbour (Whisker is the name of Ocean Park's sea lion mascot). Thrill rides are located on the upper part. There are 2 coasters: The Dragon and a Mine Train. Another thrill rides including The Abyss Drop Tower, Space Wheel, Raging River flume ride, Flying Swing, a Crazy Galleon, and Flash, the newest pendulum ride. Food & DrinkLots of eateries are scattered throughout the park. There's a McDonald's too at the upper part near all the thrill rides. Pricing might be a bit steep as any other theme park with good portion but quality and taste is quite an issue. Transportation inside the parkYou can use either 6-seater cable car that takes 8 mins to cross between the 2 lands or use a 2-min Ocean Express funicular. Both equally fun and exciting but cable car is more thrilling. ServiceStaff doesn't interact much with guests, so hospitality is not a big item here, but they do the job serving guest adequately. SignageClear signage in English is scattered throughout the park, so one no need to worry about getting lost."

The first area (near the main entrance) is where you will find the Pandas and a lot of younger child friendly attractions. If you are a teen or older i would bascillay bypass this area and head towards the upper part of the park.We took the cable cars which in all honesty in quiet a long ride. Nice view over the ocean but when looking over the park you can see a lot of rubish everywhere.The second part of the park is somewhat better but still a great disapointment.The way i would explain it is that it looks like an amusement park had closed down somewhere in the world and Ocean Park had bought all the amusement rides. All rides look old and very outdated (with todays technology i expected more).The park is huge. However you need to walk about 5 minutes or so between each ride. It becomes a tiring day quickly.Overall i actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone (unless you go once they have their new attractions up and running, which includes waterslides etc) Sorry to be blunt but its true."

But there are a lot of animals there that's worth the visit like panda, dolphins, jelly-fish, the aquarium, etc. We ate a an indoor air-conditioned chinese restaurant and it is shocking to find that the price is almost the same as eating burgers outside in the hot sun. I don't know the name of the restaurant though but it's somewhere near the stall games area."

If you are in Hong Kong and enjoy an night of scary halloween fun, Haunted Houses, Ghoulish Monsters that are each and individually a kodak moment then Ocean Park is a must see visit while in Hong Kong. I have visited Halloween events all over the United States and really have not seen an event as outstanding as Ocean Parks Halloween Bash. This Hong Kong park has set the bar haunted event attractions. Every year Ocean Park creates over 500 new signature creatures that ghoulishly greet guests in their haunted themed areas. Guest line up for photos with these creepy kodak moments. The haunted houses are awesome, the attractions are really designed well with effects that really put fun scares into the guest that visit the attractions. Some of the attractions are even interactive and when you leave the attraction you are able to check your score on how many ghosts you captured while in the haunted attraction. Ocean Park Halloween is a Hong Kong locals favorite. The guests from Hong Kong are mad about this place and eagerly anticipate the annual event. The reason the locals like this event so much is because every year the event changes. If you are in Hong Kong and enjoy Halloween I would like to encourage you to visit this outstanding seasonal event!If you are looking for somewhere to stay while in Hong Kong near Ocean Park I would like to suggest L'Hotel Island South. The property is brand new, excellent guest service, and has excellent shuttle service. The hotel provides a free shuttle available to its hotel guest. The shuttle goes to many places inclusive of the train stations Hong Kong and Central, Causeway Bay, Aberdeen Center, Ocean Park and a few other stops. Ask for Alex Chow - Guest Services Manager. Alex is an excellent host and his fellow staff members provide guests with an excellent hotel experience."

With the volumes and queues seeing the park even in it's current shape in 1 day is near impossible to enjoy the fullest.1 issue I have with the park is effective queue mangement apart form guide ropes. Queue jumping was ripe meaning the signs for 30 minute waits may mean 50-60 if 1 family line hopper welcomes 3-4 family jumpers. This trick is prevalant in many theme parks bout particularly bad at the OP in times when they are busy.Food is not to bad for price buy the general merchandise is not good at all for price.rain all day.Overall OP is a must do if only to ride the Dragon or the Runnaway Mine train sites of the Island."

We visited on a Saturday in the middle of Hong Kong school holidays on a very hot day. There were huge queues for every ride and very little shade from the sun. We only got to try two rides, which was very disappointing for my kids, but the heat and the long lines were too much. The layout of the park was also challenging, with a never-ending system of escalators that linked the upper and lower levels of Ocean Park. I would not recommend taking children that need a stroller. Our young son refused to walk because of the heat and the distances and the stroller was a nuisance in this uneven terrain.Some things that we liked were the cable cars (a 4 lane highway so not much waiting needed), the aquarium and the wet zone. The pandas would have been good except that only one panda was out of its enclosure and was sitting at the back facing the wall. Travelling to and from Ocean Park from Admiralty station was relatively easy. You can buy a pass into the park at the station near the bus stop, which worked well for us."

The good part about Ocean Park is its demography. Its constructed on a hill top. You'll have to take escalators for about 5-6 floors and after each escalator, there's a level which is dedicated to an activity zone. The park has a very high class sky tram which takes you from start point to the main games area through the ride on the ocean. Park has scary rides, fun filled rides for kids and for scary people like me, panda house, mini games stalls, ocean ride, sky rocket (if i call it like this), dolphin show, and many other good places.You will find eating joints which mainly serves oriental food. You cn grab soemthing in your bags before you visit here. The traffic in this place is heavy on weekends but its good fun.Wear your sports shoes or any comfortable pair. Do get something warm to wear as it may get cold in evening."

The highlights for me were the sky tram, amazing views from up there, however i waited in line for well over an hour to get on the tram. The main reason i visited was to see the Giant Pandas, and i was not dissapointed! there are two areas where there are pandas, the Jockey Club where there are three individual areas for three different Pandas, 2 of the three were out and they were adorable. you can get pretty close, and take some great pictures, just no flash, as it disturbs the bears plus you just get a glare on the glass. the 2nd place to see the pandas is the amazing asian animals exhibit, i saw two giant pandas there, very close up. Plus they have red pandas which are just too cute. for me it was well worth going."

I took the Ocean Park City bus (HKD10.60 for adults and HKD5.30 for children under 12) from Admiralty MTR station which goes direct to the Ocean Park. You can buy the park ticket when buying the bus tickets too. Note that there are 2 entrances at Ocean Park so you have to know which entrance you are at in order to follow the map. We have difficulty figuring out how to get our way around after entering only to realise later that we are at the Tai Shue Wan entrance. At The Summit, we enjoyed the Raging River ride, Pacific Pier (Seals) & Atoll Reef. We went during off-peak but the park is still very crowded. The gates to the Ocean theatre were closed before showtime as it's full hence we missed the show much to my kids' dismay. Be there early if you wish to catch the show. Rides at the Summit is more apt for older kids while younger kids will enjoy those at The WaterFront (downhill). Long queue for the cable cars although it moves quite fast. Didn't managed to see the 2 Pandas at the Panda Habitat as they are both hiding in their \"rooms\" when we were there so we can only see them via the CCTV. Would recommend to leave before park close at 6pm in order not to be stuck at traffic jams (since no MTR station within walking distance).There's something for all ages and the best part is most of the attractions & rides are free. The only flaw would be the park is rather old but since it's not-for-profit, we can\u2019t expect much on it's maintenance anyway. The park area is big so you have to be ready for lots of walking around. Both my mum & kids are completely exhausted by the time we complete the tour, unlike Disneyland where all the attractions are pretty confined."

The Park is looking tired and they are obviously trying to create activities for adults and children to do & watch eg Sky Fair. We went to the Ocean Theatre to see the 'Sea Dreams' show which had dolphins and seals. The show itself is unremarkable (and not helped by the hundreds of people insisting on using an umbrella to shield themselves from the sun, thus obscuring the view for those behind them). The rides are only suitable for older children and there are long queues to get onto the Mine Train and Raging River. The Ocean Express train is only a 'virtual' underwater train linking the two areas. The Atoll Reef was interesting but crowded. The eateries had basic food (not expensive).  We would probably not go again- it is tired, only semi-interesting, and lots of walking."

The day we went to Oceanpark there were a lot of tour groups - We brought our 3 year old son and it was exhausting since he got tired easily and refused to walk. I couldn't blame him since the terrain is difficult to navigate, especially the uphill slopes. The atoll reef would've been nice, but it would've been better if they limit the number of people going inside per session as it got really crowded and there was not enough airconditioning to fill the room. We were literally pushed around and forward due to the large number of crowds and it was dark and hot. My son kept crying and he couldn't see the fishes which he absolutely loves. There were quite a few people who went outside the emergency exit to get some air coz they felt faint. In short, we were all like sardines vacuum packed inside the Atoll Reef.If you're travelling with teenagers, Oceanpark would be a great place to visit - their Dolphin show was great and they have a lot of thrilling rides like the mine train. If you're bringing toddlers, I would recommend Disneyland since it's more suitable for young children. Oceanpark is just way too big and difficult to navigate because of the terrain if you have to bring a stroller and children's stuff."

Ocean Theatre and Aquarium are there. During our visit there was the How to Train Your Dragon exhibit which was interesting.The Waterfront is more younger child style and also includes the Whiskas Theatre; Giant Panda Adventure and Bird Theatre.The day we went was really really crowded and we had to wait for over an hour for rides and exhibits and then the Raging River broke. The map; park and signage are really confusing with no logical layout. The pathways are narrow and many times the crowd was at a standstill.

The animal shows were nothing out of the ordinary.The Atoll Reef was a claustrophobic's nightmare. Imagine hundreds of people slowly walking the tunnels going around the aquarium.

The Cable Car Ride down the mountain was fun as the view was simply breathtaking. The Panda Exhibit was cute; I've seen pandas in the past before, but these endangered animals are a rarity and there's only a few places in the world that you can see them, so I really wanted to do that in Hong Kong.

Bus No.629 takes you straight to the Ocean Park at the Peak Entrance. It is important to note that there are 2 parts to Ocean Park. The first one is on the Peak and the second part is the Waterfront. These 2 parts are connected in 3 ways. You can choose any of the following 3 ways to travel between the Peak and the Waterfront. (1) Ocean Park Express (Train Ride) (2) Cable Car (Very Scenic and highly recommended, however scary for people who are afraid of heights) (3) Shuttle Bus The map of Ocean Park is also split into 2 which is the Peak and the Waterfront and you will need to plan the 2 parts separately as you would want to move from one to the other only once in a day, else you will end up wasting time and miss out on all the fun things to do in Ocean Park.

It's not too bad though, the have plenty of long escalators, cable cars and trains to help you get about. The scenery from around the park is quite spectacular whether over looking Aberdeen or shipping movements on South China Sea. There were enough thrill rides to keep the kids happy (Dragon, Mine Train, Abyss, etc), some more tamer rides for the older folks (Raging River, Tower, Skystar), and everyone loved the Pandas ( Red and Giant). That combined with the odd street performer, doplin show, otter feeding, sea lions, etc made for a fun day out.Cost to get in was approx AUD$35 an adult, half for kids. Except for food and drinks (which aren't at rip-off prices) everything is free once inside. We went between Christmas and New Year. Weather was about 20C and the longest queue was about 10 minutes. As I said, a good day for all with a bit of exercise thrown in for free."

There were throngs of people everywhere and it was especially crowded in the Reef exhibit during feeding time. It was so crowded (wall-to-wall people and they were pushing), one could easily lose their party or children and it was impossible to really leisurely appreciate the myraid of ocean life in the large tanks. The roller coasters were not too exciting for the teens, and wait times were about 30 minutes or less, depending on which roller coaster you were doing to ride. The teens thought The Abyss (drop ride) was more exciting. This is not a park for extreme thrill seekers. Many rides are geared to 12 and under. The best part of the day was riding the cable cars that transported you from one mountain level to another. Quite an amazing view from the cable cars! To get to the cable cars, we had to wait at least 30 minutes in a very long line. The line was moving though. The other highlight was seeing the pandas. Ironically, the panda habitat was not crowded at all and it was air conditioned so we could enjoy the pandas. For some reason the lower level was not as crowded as the upper level, but maybe it is because we did the lower level towards the end of the day. The park map is a bit confusing and some signs are posted in ways that are ambiguous. I would have rather gone on a cooler day and during non-peak times. Still, the park is unique and has an interesting variety of attractions."

The public buses will stop across the road from the carpark to Ocean Park but it's not well signposted, and you need the busdriver to tell you when to get off.2 sections to the park. The entrance half is really kitted out for very young children with the panda enclosure. As mentioned before, the panda's are very dull, but the enclosure is fantastic. Nowhere else have I seen animals live in such well air-conditioned comfort!. If it's getting too hot or noisy for you in Ocean Park, head to the pandas, where you can enjoy aircon a the massive enclosure, and noisy people have a \"No Noise\" placard thrust in front of their face!At peak times, there's an hour queue to get on the bubble car to the other side. If you do find a big queue, hop on the shuttle bus outside the entrance - every 30 mins. to the other section of the park.The other side \"Headland\" has the more thrills ride. Although my 2 kids have been veterans of several theme parks, they found the height restriction to be a pain. Even the log flume has a caution on it! If your child is less than 4 feet, they are severely restricted in the number of rides they can go on. I thought the US was bad on precautions !!! My small 6 year old have been on similar rides in the UK without any problems at all! On a week-day, non bank holiday, the queues weren't great. 45 mins for the log river ride. 1 hour for the runaway train. Only 5 minutes for the loop-the-loop rollercoaster. 30 mins for the big-wheel (2 revolutions only...)The dolphin show was enjoyable. Massive theatre. The front 1/3 seems to be empty as it's not covered. Seems like a good place to watch, until you get a family of 4 with massive umbrellas wielded in front of your face! So if you have kids, it's best to sit in the shaded areas where umbrellas remain closed!Overall an enjoyable day-out but if you are mad-keen on theme-parks, don't get your hopes up too high.Beware of the discourteous adults from the mainland whom will queue-jump at the drop of the hat (these are generally 50+ year olds when seem to get too hyper-excited) Although I'm not blessed with height, I had constant head-ache from being jabbed by umbrellas!!!!"

We arrived right on opening time and so it wasn't too crowded (yet).The location of the Park is stunning and amazing, built over 2 sites on the side of a mountain. The cable car cleverly links the 2 park sections as well as provides a ride and a chance to relax. Also there are covered outdoor escalators to assist you with the climb from entrance to attraction. The rides aren't state of the art but are fun nonetheless. Go to DisneyLand if you want the razzle dazzle. The Dolphin Show was OK, I have seen better, but my kids loved every minute of it and the view from the Theatre is spectacular. Must do's include the Raging River Ride - so much fun for everyone hence the long queues; the Sea Jelly Aquarium - so many wonderful and weird jelly fish; the Cable Car ride for the view.We allocated half a day to spend at Ocean Park and for us, it was just about enough. We visited the Pandas and indeed they were cute, but dull. They were all sleeping! A large crowd of visitors spent ages looking into a Jia Jia's enclosure - at a sack! Jia Jia was in the next enclosure snoozing on a log. We laughed and laughed and laughed and took a photo of the sack and the crowd.Definitely worth the visit for the trip to HK Island, the bus ride, the Raging River, the Jellyfish and the experience but I wouldn't be rushing to Ocean Park purely for the sake of seeing the sleepy Pandas."

The cable car ride is quite interesting, it is steep and goes by the side of the sea to reach the other end.Among the attractions, important ones are the baloon ride-a giant baloon which takes you up at about 100m to give a panormic view of HK, the Panda bears, various other animals, including the dolphins and the sea lion show!!Lots of eating and playing arena. All in all a good place to go wth family especially if you have kids in the age group of 2-12"

Dolphin and sea lion show was excellent and venue has great views. Aquarium, cable car ride and wild water ride all very good. Various roller coasters etc are there but they looked fairly tame by modern standards. Six giant pandas are kept in enclosures where visitors can get very close separated only by glass but we thought they looked bored and frustrated and that enclosures should have been bigger. Food outlets looked good but we think meal we had at main restaurant was source of food poisoning which started that night. Worth a visit but don't expect state of the art rides."

I am very irritated by the fact that most of the complaints about Ocean Park are about the temperature, the walk, the fact that Ocean Park is not Disneyland, and the fact that there is not enough indoors in Ocean Park. Maybe we should all take a breath and realize that Hong Kong has possible 40 degree summers. Let's appreciate that Ocean Park is not plastic, and that it is not made just for tourists, but for the people who actually live in Hong Kong, many of which find Disneyland too fake for them. If someone decided to go somewhere, wouldn't they search up a bit about it? If they did, they could, perhaps, wear sneakers to said place, so they could walk around, and try to admire the gardens and nature around them as they did. They could wear thin clothing, get a hat, or simply go to the place when the weather was cooler, like when the skies are somewhat cloudy. I must say, though, that this is not a good place for those with small children, or, at least, those who have with them people that tire easily. I also realize how ridiculously un-stroller friendly the park is. I think this is a place best for older children. Maybe above 10. But at least try to appreciate the amount of sky you can see as you zip off on a roller coaster, rather than complain because the roller coaster is not in a building filled with fake stars."

We got on the Raging River (log flume) ride first and while enjoyable its in dire need of an upgrade. We got absolutely soaked on the ride (half expected!)and spent the day smelling like dirty water or wet dog - God knows what was in the water! Places to sit and rest to top up sun cream etc.. are extremely limited and even areas around food stands are tiny. The park is set over a number of hills with plenty of steep inclines and escalators - not child / stroller friendly at all - we had to keep taking our son out of his stroller to use the escalators. A large percentage of rides / attractions were closed when we visited and the animal enclosures were under refurbishment. We left the park within two hours, disappointed.

There was hardly and shade and when we found some, the radiant heat off the footpaths and surrounding fixtures made you feel like you were sitting in an oven. There are no air conditioned eating areas and when you do buy some food to eat there is only limited seating so expect to eat standing up. The three tier escalator to move you up the mountain made you feel like you were being transported to the gates of hell as the the heat was over bearing. They desperately need fans on that to at least give you some moving air.The only cool refuge we found was in the Panda exhibit. Needless to say we stayed in there for over an hour. Not only because it was air conditioned but also because the pandas were beautiful. In fact I'd really only recommend going to this park if you've never seen a panda before as pretty much they are the only unique thing about this park.We also found that being Westerners that we were stared at alot which also made us feel uncomfortable. We didn't experience this anywhere else in Hong Kong and for that matter I've not experienced it to that level anywhere else in the world.The park is set out over a mountain so requires alot of walking up and down hills. In the heat this almost killed us. The rides are nothing to write home about. The day we were there the water flume ride was closed. There was no mention of this at the park entrance when we bought our tickets.The jelly fish exhibit was pretty good. I felt sorry though for the dolphins in their tiny pool (I've swum in bigger suburban back yard pools). So in summary this place needs alot more air conditioned areas (particularly eating spaces) to cool guests down. They might also want to think about eliminating the need for visitors having to walk up hill long distances in the heat"

Upon entering the park, we had to take mutiple upward escalator rides in order to visit the Jellyfish and shark sites. With a 5 years old kid, it was a nightmare to spend time walking from one place to another in the park. With nothing much to see, we just kept walking and walking uphill and up many steep slopes. The Jellyfish site was a letdown if you have seen any of such eslewhere in the world. We were so tired walking we gave up visiting the shark site because it would mean another long walk again.We took the cable car ride downhill and that alone was the best and worth the price of the ticket. It was a spectacular long ride around mountains. Great scenery and peace up there.When we reached the station downhill, it was another dreadful long walk again to see the Panda who were all sleeping!My girl complained about nothing much to see in this Ocean Park and felt rather disappointed. We couldn't be bothered to take the shuttle bus uphill to switch back to the return bus ride back to town (already paid for when we purchased the return tickets).

Wow - half of Ocean Park is perched high on a mountain overlooking the water and the other half is at the bottom of the mountain connected by cable cars. The rollercoasters literally hang off the mountain - its worth seeing just to marvel at the layout of it all. It's kind of a zoo, fun park and seaworld all rolled into one.Piece of advice - arrive when the Park opens (at 10am). We didn't get there until 11.30am and ran out of time to do the rides. Plan out your day carefully to cover as much as you can. There's typically a line for the cable cars and unless you want a ridiculously long walk there is no other way to get from one side to the other. We went on a Friday and it was packed, especially in the afternoon - can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend? The pandas were great - the most active we have ever seen, somersaulting and playing in the water! There were fun rides for the kids - a grandprix car track, a balloon type ride, rapid ride etc. The dolphin and seal shows were nice - you aren't going to get the quality of a US Seaworld but these animals were great to see in any capacity. The aquarium is outstanding - best fish etc, better than any we've seen. Our kids loved it - and we really enjoyed the fact that it was different and kind of quirky. Low end food was pretty bad but that's par for the course for a fun park - they have a McDonalds and other takeaway places. We're really glad that we spent a day there - it's not perfect but its so different than any place we've ever been that it was more than worth a visit."

I have lived in HK 2 years and never been to Ocean Park because I never have a day off during the week and would never visit on the weekend because I know it will be packed. Anyway with visitors in town I went today and we had a very enjoyable day with hardly any queues. $70 for parking and $185pp to get in. All rides were inc. in the price but the arcade style games all over the park weren't.First up were the panda's at about 10.30am, one eating, one sleeping and the 2 two year olds were wrestling so it was a good start. You walk along a queuing race to see them but it is on 2 levels so you go past twice and can see them easily and can stop if you want.Then we took the cable car to the other side and really enjoyed the ride. The Ocean Pier sea lion exhibit was good. We did all the rides and none were too scary. The Raging River and Mine Roller Coaster were a bit of a trek to get to but worth it. The aquarium was quite impressive and a good place to cool off.Food options were not great so we had McDonalds and there was no where indoors to eat and cool off so that was a bit annoying as were the hoards of mainland tourists wanting to take their picture with me nad my blonde hair - very pleased we didn't go on the weekend but on the weekend I think there would be more food options as many of the smaller kiosks were closed. Gift shops were dissapointing - poor choice of postcards and fridge magnets.We centred our day around finishing with the dolphin and sea lion show which had alot of promise but was a bit of a let down actually. The sealion show at Taronga Zoo in Sydney is 10 times better even though the set up isn't as nice. Get there 30mins before if you want a seat in the shade. All seats are individual so squashing is not a problem but on weekends it would be full - there wasn't much room left today.Non-operational rides were listed on the website and at the front entrance so this avoided any disappointment. Generally I thought the park was well maintained (a bit of paint needed in some areas) and there were lots of toilets all of which were above average in cleanliness. I would recommend it for a good day out, don't go with any expectations and you won't be dissapointed. Highly recommend you get a season pass if you have kids in HK but you will have to splash out a bit more cash for many of the kiddie games and attractions.Have yet to go Disney in HK but I think it will be a different experience, Disney is probably more 'perfect' but less enjoyable for adults without kids."

We went back in August 2007 and noticed quite a few differences.It was VERY hot this time and the lack of shade was noticeable.It was incredibly busy, with queues too long to bother with for some attractions. t was difficult to even move around sometimes, and the queue to get the cable car back was more than half an hour.The park is undergoing rebuilding and some attractions such as butterflies and goldfish/carp seem to have disappeared.4 Pandas now present, but all were asleep both times I tried to view them.Food is still crap, and you also have a long queue for it.Pandas, Cable Car ride, aquarium and shark tank are still worth the admission prices on their own, but maybe not when you are accompanied by thousands of locals carrying you through in a sea of bodies.Do not queue for something called the \u201cPanda Extravaganza\u201d show, which turns out to be an assortment of locals dressed in furry suits doing a song and dance act. Avoid at all costs.Get there at opening time to have at least some relatively quiet time to look around."

            "review": "Fun Times in Ocean Park. I went to Ocean Park recently (July 2007)I had been to Disneyland the day before and it was interesting to see the difference between the two amusement parks.Ocean Park has much better rides - if stomach churning rides are your thing.There are 2 Roller Coasters - one with loop-the-loops and a corkscrew, and the other a little less scaryThe Abyss - where you travel about 50 feet up in the air, and then DROPThe Log Ride, A spinning contraption...litterally HEAPS of ridesWhat Ocean Park lacks however is the comfort of Disney.I did go on a Sunday, which is bound to have more people in the park, but the lines were the same as Disney lines on the Saturday. The only problem is that there is very little shade and moving air and no airconditioning anywhere.I would definitely recommend Ocean Park, but would advise you take an umbrella to shade yourself, and possibly a little personal fan, just to take the edge off the heatEnjoy!"

            "review": "The worst amusement park I have ever visited. My wife, my 5 year old daughter and I just spent part of today at this place. After spending yesterday at Hong Kong Disney and enjoying it very much, today was, quite frankly, a bit of a nightmare. After riding 4 or 5 very lengthy escalators past numerous tacky shops and foul smelling fast food stands, we arrived at the sea lion exhibit-a disappointing spectacle! Hard to imagine following hundreds and hundreds of people through claustrophopic corridors for 2 hours with a five year old in search of something that resembled an aquarium or something close to the attractions at places like Sea World or the Vancouver Aquarium, but that is what this place is like. Apparently there is an aquarium, but the line up to see it was at least 1-2 hrs wait.At the end of our visit, my wife politely asked the \"guest relations\" department for a refund of our admission fee and, fully in keeping with the rest of the experience, we were given the option of filling out a guest comment card.We generally enjoy our visits to family oriented attractions-even if some are a bit tacky. This place, however, is in a different league!Best advice-stay away!"

We went to Ocean Park a few days after going to Disneyland, expecting better things, unfortunately it wasn't to be.The bad:- need to walk a lot without cover in 30C heat. Unlike Disneyland where there are lots of cover, it's in short supply in OP.- couldn't find any drinking fountain. Soda costs 3x of what on sale in 7-11!!!! - rides look and feel out of date.- lots of amusement park type games which you have to pay extra for playing.The good:- gondola ride - raging river- the crowd quite well behaved, a good thing since there are lots of mainlanders.- lots of scary ridesSummary:don't go, better take the train to Thung Chung and get on the gondola to Ngong Ping 360. Obviously Disneyland is a must."

The main reason I went there was to see the Giant Panda's which turned out not to be on display as their enclosure was undergoing major renovation work. It was appalling you didn\u2019t find out till you had paid for your ticket and entered the park that you couldn\u2019t see them. The few other animals that were there were so difficult to see and held in such tiny pools that I was appalled. The rest of the park was either closed or the few rides that were open were very tame. Save your money and go and see a real Giant Panda conservation centre or visit Disney World for the rides."

            "review": "Top 5 Rides at Ocean Park. If you want to be a kid-at-heart once again, or if you want to test how courageous you could be as an adult, here are the top 5 rides you must experience at Ocean Park, HK:No. 5- The Raging River. Be prepared to get wet in this 2-minute ride. The downhill slide is the best! Not to mention that this is the instant your photo will get taken, so SMILE... Note: If you get really scared, be sure to keep your mouth closed, okay. Some photos can get very unflattering!No. 4- The Dragon/The MIne Train. These are two different rides, which to me, practically gives the same sensation- so you could choose either one if you are pressed for time. They're just like your regular roller coaster, only the view down below makes it extra-exciting! Keep your eyes open, or the experience will be only half as good.No. 3- The Space Wheel. Surprisingly, this ride does not have a lot of fans- the queue isn't that long. But believe me, the experience is awesome! It does feel like being thrown into the sky like a yo-yo- only you're trapped in a \"car.\" Beware though, you will definitely feel a bit nauseated afterwards... So don't eat before getting in!No. 2- The Cable Car. This is the most relaxing ride, best ridden at night when you're heading back to Lowland from Headland. The lights in the park provide an amazing view, and it is the perfect way to cap the night... Finally, No. 1- The Abyss. This will certainly test your limits. Pretend you're inside a lift, only sitting down and carefully (!?!) strapped. Imagine plummeting down so fast your gut seems to travel up your throat...then rising up to replace your organs, only to plunge down again. Whew! What a ride! If I were you, I'd chose the section which gives you a full view of the cliff. This is definitely super-fun!Hmm... On second thought, just be kids- be fearless. Leave the rationalizing to adults!"

Actually half the attractions are closed. Bunch of roller coasters and lots, lots and then more teenagers with camera phones. It's a hike to get there and generally EXTREMELY unpleasant if you're over about 19. Avoid. Go to the Peak for lunch instead. Don't eat in the main building. Go outside (hard to figure out how) and find the lovely Lookout at the Peak restaurant. Great view. Pretty Garden. Not cheap but worth it.Enjoy."

It had it's good points and it's bad points..Good - Without a doubt it was probably worth the admission price for the cable car trip up to the higher part of the park. The views really were truly amazing. The aquarium was also quite interesting. A big plus was that the queues for the rises were really short, so if rides are your thing, you could have got your money's worth. Bad - I would give it a miss if you don't have children, as many of the rises are aimed at children. A big draw for me was to see the pandas and, like another reviewer, I did find it a litle upsetting to see the relatively small enclosure which they were in. Same goes for the dolphins. if you do only have a few days to spend in Hong Kong, I think there are other must-dos rather than visit Ocean Park."

This would be simple wasting money and your time.1/ Park divided into 2 parts - lowlands (with panda habitat) and highlands (rides, marine show, aquarium). To get ther get 629 bus from Admiralty or Central (pier 7).2/ You pay at the entrance but all attractions in Lowlands (exept pandas) are for extra money - carting, whiskers ride. Cable car is free but operates only after 11:00 (park opens at 10:00). But pandas are great I don`t know any other place in the world where you can see these fantastic animals so close.2/ In the Highlands almost nothing to do or see. Marine show is poor and in low professional level, feeding sealions (25 HK) is swift and ordinary. Aquarium is indeed 3 -storie galleria but around Asia I`ve seen enough of it. All rides are pretty usual, no signature attractions at all.3/ The summary - better go to Disneyland."

My kids, 14 and 11, enjoyed the rides and with no waiting lines my son rode the Abyss 5 times in a row. The cable car view alone is worth the trip. No, it's not Cedar Pointe but for my amusement park starved kids (we live in Shanghai) it was a great day. Around 3:30 in the afternoon the tour bus groups started arriving and things got more crowded. We used the KCR Ocean Park special ticket which includes a free KCR pass and shuttle bus for the price of admission to Ocean Park. Definitely a good value compared to the tour packages who wanted an extra HK$100 each over the admission cost."

The cable cars here are my favourite thing in Hong Kong - the views as you ride are stunning (and I am afraid of heights, but always try to ride on these when I visit HK). I think these alone are worth the admission price.The first time I visited here, I had considerable walking difficulties following very recent surgery, but coped ok,and found the staff very anxious to help.The water-themed attractions and the pandas are marvellous and I love the quirkiness of attractions such as the goldfish pavilion and the giant escalator.The Middle Kingdom is unusual and prettily laid-out.This theme park has a Chinese feel to it - don't go if you want a plasticky Americanized experience - do go if you want a happy day out with something different to see and do."

            "review": "Amazing dolphin encounter!. My husband and I went to ocean park on Monday 7th November and spent around 4 hours there - 1 1/2 hours of which was the dolphin encounter. I wasn't sure about whether we should go to Disney or Ocean Park - but from forum advice decided to try ocean park. The website was quite helpful - as I found details on it of the dolphin encounter program. This was really good fun! It cost an additional hkd$685 approx. I booked it 2 weeks in advance over the internet as there are limited places on it. Basically you get to go behind the scenes to meet the dolphins. The encounter consisted of 1/2 hour induction class learning about dolphins. Then those taking part in the encounter changed into waterproof waders and then got to feed and touch the dolphins. I really enjoyed this! I learnt so much about the beautiful creatures and loved meeting them. My husband wasn't taking part, but as a guest got to join me in both the class and watching me in the little pool - at no cost. I thoroughly recommend this! We also saw one of the pandas (an an - chi chi was resting!) which I also enjoyed. Atholl Reef is really great too - it is worth taking the time going round it and really looking at all the different fish etc. A lot of folk just seem to rush on past. We did do the cable cars too. I do have a bad fear of heights and was dreading it, but wanted to say I had done it. The ride is really hairy, lots of clunking noises and jolts - however, the view from the car is great - if you are brave enough to open your eyes!!!!We weren't really bothered for the rides, and I can appreciate those comments that say the park is dated in that we chose not to eat there, and some of the attractions were closed for refurbishment. I found it hard to score this - because the dolphin encounter was excellent in my view, however overall I think the park is average - I have therefore gone in between the two. If you are simply wanting a day for the kids on different rides etc, then I suspect Disney is the better option, however if you love animals, and want a day out of the mad rush of Hong Kong, Ocean Park is worth going to and has some lovely scenery.Hope this helps."

It was a long ride with spacious scene of HK landscape & seaview, but quite scary! The worst thing is the toilet very dirty & smelly, I dare not to go in when saw it, liak!!The food also so so only, compare to Disneyland.Need maintainence if want to compete with Disneyland.The dolpin show also not very interesting, we sat under the big sun, so hot that we cannot stand to watch the whole show finish. Will not go again if we go HK next time!"

Not a good place to bring kids under the age of 5. We wasted an entire morning not because we were staying on by choice but because to get out of the park itself is a chore with lots and lots of walking to do from point to point with plenty of stairs! There is nothing much at the Lowland Park except for the pandas for the younger kids. As for the other side of the park, the shark aquarium had only one reasonably big shark (Sentosa's underwater world is better). Only good thing was the Atoll Reef which was nice but filled with stairs from level to level(no ramps!!). The cable car ride is OK for the view but those who have a fear of heights should stay clear as it gets quite scary at certain points and it's a long ride. The park staff were also hardly to be found anywhere(if you needed directions). The toilets were very dirty and the variety of food sold in the park was not good."

We spent about 5-6 hrs from 10am till about 4 pm and did not even manage to cover all of the park. Its huge!Most memorable was the cable car ride. This is a great experience with beautiful view of the sea and surrounding islands. If you only got time to do one thing at Ocean Park, this is IT! Take the cable car! Of course depending on what time of the day you go, there's going to be long queues... but its a really wonderful 10-15 minutes ride, enjoy the sea breeze while going over the hills at a pretty precarious angle. :)We watched the Dolphin and Sea-Lion show which was entertaining but nothing special than what is expected from such a show. Took the Roller Coaster ride called 'Dragon', i think. Take it for the wonderful view coz its perched on the side of the cliff. The ride was short and not too hair-raising but still fun! Plenty of other thrill rides as well but the best stuff would belong to the sea creatures. The nature reef was very good. Its therapeutic to look at the different fishes and the beautiful corals. Pacific Pier houses the Sea Lions. Its also nice esp at feeding times. The Shark underwater gallery is also quite interesting.All in all, I'd say that Ocean Park is an excellent family-themed park. You cannot finish it in one day but its nice to spend a few hrs here to stroll among the greenery, see the fishes etc and get on a few thrill rides.It's not Disneyland but a very good cousin, in my opinion. :)If you can manage the time while in HK, do visit the Ocean Park. Of course, try to visit during the off-peak days and in good weather so you don't have to jostle with the crowds."
