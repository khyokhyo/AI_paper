            "review": "A must if you're into contemporary/modern art. Istanbul Modern is one of the few museums in Turkey that is on par with its European counterparts. Of course how well you relate with the art inside is subjective (and also depends on the exhibitions that are in place at the time). Personally I think the museum is in a way similar to prominent modern art museums in Europe but has a different edge to it due to its being closer to the east. The building and the view of the sea from the museum creates a sentimental mood which adds up to the experience. Overall, I really love the place."

Some great video pieces that must be seen. The retrospective of Eviner's work was just mind-blowing! I wish the basement floor would leave it up permanently.For the non-art lovers, the museum is a special spot of calm in the city! Gorgeous cafe with a deck just feet over the Bosphorous and fabulous views. The front lawn was full of people hanging out and enjoying the space, soaking up the special atmosphere."

All exhibits were done by Turkish artists, none of whom I'd ever heard of, but the works of art were excellent and probably easily appreciated even by those who normally do not like modern art. The one thing to note is that modern art does not necessarily mean abstract art. In fact a fair number of exhibits were photographs which simply depicted modern reality. I only had two hours to spare but left feeling that I would love to come back and spend more time in there as I didn't get a chance to really savor everything on exhibit. this museum is relatively easy to get to. If you can find the tram, you just get off at Tophane station and it's a short walk from there. Highly recommended for those who have more than the usual 3 or 4 days in Istanbul. I nearly forgot, there's an excellent cafe in the museum with magnificent views across the water of Sultanahmet, Hagia Sophia and Topkapi Palace."

            "review": "Istanbul Modern: Not to be Missed. Istanbul Modern is not to be missed. Even if you plan to focus on the city\u2019s many historical sites, you owe it to yourself to experience Istanbul (in particular) and Turkey (in general) from the varied perspectives of its thoughtful modern and contemporary artists. Especially given the tumult the country is in today (after events like last week\u2019s unsuccessful coup attempt), it is important to acknowledge and learn about present-day circumstances, and you will find Turkey\u2019s rich artistic culture to be a fine teacher. We visited the museum in May of 2016 and found it excellent in every way, from its beautiful placement on the Bosphorus, to its sleek architectural design, to the quality of its collection and expertly curated exhibits. Many individual artworks have stayed with me since my visit, including the disorienting and powerful installation of two lighted globes called \u201cStrange Fruit\u201d by Hale Tenger, which alone is worth the price of admission. In addition to great art, the museum also has an elegant\u2014and yet reasonably priced\u2014restaurant with a stylish interior seating area and, even better, a balcony right on the Bosphorus. After the hard work of museum-going, that balcony is heavenly. We had planned to go to the museum just once, but found the whole experience too good not to visit a second timeAn added note: not far from the Istanbul Modern is another excellent museum (in the Beyoglu district), The Museum of Innocence, which is set in a house and is organized like a large kunstkammer, with curious, emotion-laden displays of everyday objects \u201cused\u201d by the fictional characters in the novel of the same name by Nobel Prize-winning Turkish author Orhan Pamuk. If you like Surrealism, Joseph Cornell, and/or shadow boxes, you will love this unusual museum."

Great art work from all over the world--neither too big nor too small with a great view of the waterfront. Restaurant was supposed to be good but service wasn't too friendly. Stick to the art work. Just take the tram to Tophane station and it's a short 5 minute walk away on level ground. There's a lot of construction going on about but inside, it's cool and calming. Great choice for a midday hot summer stroll. It's not part of the Museum Pass, though so be ready to pay the 25 turkish lira fee."

One thing that impressed me the most was that there was a real downplay of the pretension which normally accompanies modern and contemporary art. The space itself is beautiful. It has incredible views of the Bosphorus and the Old City. And it's spacious inside to give each piece space so it can be viewed without the crowding found in other museums.It's in a formerly industrial building and fairly isolated. Our cab driver had a little trouble finding it. It's worth the trip and can be a great morning addition to a Beyoglu and Istikal Street walk/tour. I will say if you are planning to walk it be prepared for the extraordinary hills of Istanbul. And an near unending stair case."

Food was amazing though- had a thin crust margarita pizza (25TL). There's a lot of local art and variety- installations, mixed media, videos, etc. Sometimes the sound from some artworks interferes/is annoying when looking at other pieces- but this is only top RHS gallery, the rest is fine.

Often you will see Warhol, Hirst, Richter and there may be a handful of known names here. But they showcase Turkish art which is fascinating and unique.I saw the current collection show plus the nature inspired exhibit and they were both very well done. The one drawback is the show i saw last Spring had a bottom 30% of the same works. I hope the Modern expands its collection. Plus the gallery is just gorgeous. The views over the Bosphorus are spectacular. I don't know why people would give the gallery a low rating because of construction. That has nothing to do with the gallery.

Having not discovered much in the way of contemporary art in the huge city of Istanbul I was pleasantly surprised by the Istanbul Modern. One of my top galleries. Beautiful setting right on the Bosphorus with fantastic views from the gallery restaurant. We didn't eat there, but if you want to treat yourself I would definitely recommend hanging out there for a drink or some food. The gallery has two floors. It's the perfect size. Big enough that you feel you have been to a substantial exhibition, whilst not maxing out your appreciation of the work. A fantastic mix of works and well curated. If you love contemporary art - go! If you think you don't like contemporary art - go! I think this could be the beginning of your appreciation."

There were one or two school groups that were there and doing school activities amongst the exhibitions, I found this to be fantastic! To see young children gain such great exposure and get comfortable in that setting. I was amazed by the diversity of contributing artists on show from Turkish to South African. A great afternoon spent. I found the museum entrance a bit pricey (25 TL), which may be steep for a budget traveler, but worth it nonetheless."

Firstly the building is a delight, a converted warehouse right on the waterfront with a rather good restaurant. We looked out of the huge windows at grey skies and choppy water which felt like an artwork itself. The multi media works are very accessible, and different, ranging from paintings, huge installations and videos. All were telling a story of Istanbul and Turkish issues today....yes , politics are very present here but expressed with sensitivity and respect for difference. Lots of food for thought.This was great for us as it was pouring with rain, but this gallery should not be missed on a fine day as the building and its outside seating on the river looks fabulous. I will go again as the exhibitions change regularly."

The exhibits cover a big area and make sure to give yourself enough time so as not to rush through. The restaurant is good and you can enjoy a cup of coffee overlooking the Bosphorus and the museum has a good selection of items for sale. Take the Kabatas tram line and get off at Tophane stop. From there just follow the signs for the museum. It is an easy walk of about 10 minutes. If you are over 60 years of age you get a discount on the entrance fee. Closed on a Monday."

You could see the red little signs for the Modern from this area so quite easy to locate. The upstairs has a good mix of works. The one which seemed to grab attention was the feather boa installation! It was very interesting to see what was on the other side. I do think though that the downstairs exhibition that is currently on is very interesting and I wish we had started down there so as to spend more time having a look. Personally for me it was nice to go back after 7/8 years though it is a shame that it is no longer free admission to tourists. Nonetheless, if you want to have a look around something different, head here. Some lovely mosques nearby as well to take in."

When I came here with my family, there was an interactive exhibit with magnifying glasses and suitcases and chairs. The sign said we could touch and move the art, so we did. We wanted to open one of the suitcases, but the guard rushed up to us and said we couldn't open it. I told her that it was an interactive exhibit, but she was really insistent. That ruined my \"interaction.\" I wonder what the artist would have thought about that. She proceeded to follow us to the next exhibit (not even from a distance, literally SHOULDER TO SHOULDER) and scolded every little thing we did. When my stepmom pulled out her phone for pictures, the lady quickly said \"No video!\" The exhibit was in a separate room, and played a short song in a loop. When the short song finished, she strangely rushed us out of the room saying \"It's finished! It's done!\" It was super weird. Why was this necessary? What was she afraid we would do? At the restaurant, the servers were extremely rude. After not even being acknowledged and standing there waiting, I decided to just get menus and sit. Then they acted really weird and offended about it! I even told them that we had been waiting and no one showed up. This trend continued throughout the whole time we were there. They didn't come back to get our order, so I had to run and get them. When they finally came with our drinks, they didn't give us sugar and rushed away before we could ask for it, and I had to go get it from them. Then when we wanted the check, I had to run and get them again. Each time I ran over, they acted super annoyed! But I wouldn't have been doing that had they served us properly!! Ugh!Later on, we walked down the stairs. When we were done, we tried to walk back up but there was this lady sitting there making sure people didn't go up the stairs??? Why?? There were people coming down the stairs! She pointed in the general direction of a supposed elevator, which was hard to find since it was a freight elevator with a door that didn't automatically open. Thankfully, the art made up for the weird guards and servers. It's worth seeing even if you have this same experience. I hope they decide to make the rude guards part of the exhibit. That would actually be pretty cool."

Located in a somewhat run down neighbourhood which seems to be in a state of abandonment with derelict but not demolished buildings with very sad remnants of the old area still struggling to survive close by - this museum exactly epitomises the dilemma that Istanbul finds itself. The building is relatively modern with a hard to find entrance but once inside you could be in Barcelona or Berlin . The exhibits were interesting and thought provoking with a particularly interesting photographic section and some film or video performances that demonstrated the cultural clashes in Turkey resulting mainly from religious differences. We were just taking tea in the caf\u00e9 when what we thought was a block of apartments outside started to move - it was a huge cruise ship coming in to dock - the side view of which glided silently past the window. A strange vista indeed as was the whole experience. Go there if you get the chance - we are somehow glad we did."

The museum is in an old warehouse a few feet from the ships.The art was marginal when I was there. Today, as in so much of art, theatre and lit., everything is about Feminism, Racism and How I suffered from (name it) not having enough Lego blocks or the current best cell phone. I know the former two are serious matters, but really 40 years of Feminist shouting at us and lecturing us at every turn is already enough - thanks. Anti-racism \"art\" may feel good, but what has all the \"feel good\" activity ever accomplished in the past 4 decades of it.Frankly, I think this Museum trivializes real art, Budapest on the other hand has one of the most beautiful new galleries, in a spectacular setting, with a decent collection and when I was there, a nice Russian show of recent art."

I am a prolific visitor to art museums and galleries and I find I see the same art by the same artists in galleries all over the world but here I only recognised one pice of art that I had previously viewed at Tate Modern in London.I would highly recommend this gallery if you are interested in Contemporary Art.A lot of guide books say that this gallery is free on Thursdays but it's only free to residents of Istanbul... so not the best day to visit if you don't live there! It's only 10 L entry or 5 L if you have a student card. You can get here easily by tram but finding the way in isn't straight forward, you can see it but the way in is confusing... though a car park. They have a restaurant where you can sit by the water that serves first class food and wines, puts the food served in Tate Modern Restaurant in London to shame and at a fraction of the price!"

It has been really bad. There are 4 people in the staff : one of them is working behind the bar to prepare the coffee, the other one is dealing with paying, and two young women are waiting for ... your leaving... ! Indeed it is a self service bar : we have to choose betwenn iced tea, water and so on and to help ourselves but.... No price is indicated ! Furthermore, we have to wait almost 5-10' so that we can pay, because just one \"waiter\" deals with paying while both women don't do anything. So we queued at the bar, then the waiter said we had to take the drink in the fridges, we did it and then we had to queue again to pay, the drinks in hands... Finally we paid : a hairless waiter with a beard spoke very fast, we didnt understand the price and it seemed like he didn't care about us. We gave 20 TL because we believed having understand that we had to pay 20 TL (I remain that absolutely no price is indicated). But the waiter asked if we had 2 TL more. Thinking that we didn't understand the price well, we gave him 2 TL. And what a surprise... He put the 2 TL in the tip-box without asking us, as if it was included in the price !!!! We were so astonished that we couldn't find any word... We found it very disrespectful. Furthermore the two waitresses have always been waiting that we finished our two iced teas so as to they can clean the table. We had barely finished our drinks that they cleaned the table although we were still sitting. The ice tea was tasteless. We have been very disappointed."

When I got up to there I was told that - even though there were only 15 minutes left before closing - I would have to buy a full-price ticket to take the sculpture-stairway down.Nonetheless, I would highly recommend a visit - both to the Istanbul Modern and the 14th Biennale called Saltwater.

It also makes a great independent excursion for those who have arrived on a cruise and have just a couple of hours to spare in Istanbul. You might find that your ship is berthed right in front of the gallery but you will still need to walk down to the port terminal to leave the wharf. Turn left on the main street and walk a few blocks until you see the large sign for Modern. All the walking is on the flat. Turn left down the lane towards the sea and walk right across the car park to the entrance of the museum. The upstairs restaurant (there are lifts) overlooks the water and looks very pleasant.Modern is an excellent addition to the wonderful images of Istanbul that you will take away and you can be sure of being back on board for sail-away."

I'll focus on transportation: From the Sultanahmed take the tram T1 to Kabatas until Tophane. Keep walking in the direction of the tram for about 200 meters, then turn right. Upon arrival you can safely store your bags and enjoy this wonderful and air conditioned museum. The restaurant is certainly not cheap (40 Lire for 2 coffee and 1 cake), but the quality and views are great. There's easy and cheap access to the Attaturk airport in about 1hour and 15 minutes. Take the T1 tram to Bagcilar or Soganli until Zeytinburru. From there take the metro M1A to the airport. Highly recommended!"

There was also an \"experiential\" exhibit there where you had to push your way through some feathers suspended from the cieling to get into a room with a spinning globe and some audio. We went in and out a few times as it was great fun, the tactile nature of it being unusual and It made me feel happy.Essentially then you have paintings/prints, sculptures, photographic material and experiential exhibits, all being excellent content."

The seeds for the Istanbul Modern project were sown in 1987, during the 1st International Contemporary Art Exhibition, known today as the International Istanbul Biennial. Motivated by the interest shown in the event and the dynamism it contributed to the Istanbul art scene, Dr. Nejat F. Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 embarked on the project to endow Istanbul with a permanent Museum of Contemporary Art.After a long quest, the Feshane, a former 19th century textile manufacturing plant on the Golden Horn, was converted into a Museum of Contemporary Art. Although the building housed the 3rd International Istanbul Biennial in 1991, the Project never reached its long term goal.From then on, various institutions and individuals sought to establish a Museum of Modern Art in Istanbul. Unfortunately, these initiatives failed for lack of suitable space or due to difficulties in obtaining artworks to form the core of the permanent collection.The fate of the Project changed once again in 2003, when the fourth warehouse on the Galata pier, near the Mimar Sinan Academy of Fine Arts, served as the main venue for the 8th Istanbul Biennial. After Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan gave his approval for the permanent use of the site, the Project\u2019s main obstacle was removed. The 8,000 square meter dry cargo warehouse, owned by the Turkish Maritime Organization, was transformed into a modern museum building with all corresponding functions."

Add to this a great cafe with some of the best food in Istanbul and views of the river this is a great day out"

But Istanbul Modern showcases a new side of Istanbul that is emerging and that is equally as important.The museum is excellently curated. Give yourself at least 2-3 hours!

I visited Istanbul for the 4th time (and definitely coming back) this December.We have seen all the tourist places so far - so we planned to see some new places. We got recommendation from our local friends about Istanbul Modern.We came around 3pm (tough party last night) and at first enjoyed few sunbeams on the amazing terrace (Istanbul Modern Restaurant).The lower floor the Istanbul Modern was closed due to some event last night, so we only took a guided tour of the permanent exhibition - and I must say, despite the fact I am not a big lover of modern art (visiting MOMA in US was a real pain for me), Istanbul Modern has a lot to offer to anyone.Most of the pieces are not part of the modern abstract art (which I really dont like), but there are many beautiful paintings from the post-Ottoman era. I must strongly recommend to go with organized tour - we heard many interesting stories about the \"behind the courtains\" things.Some paintings were really lame, but the guide told us what is the reason why they are in the gallery - there was always some strong reason, which made part of the modern turkish art mosaic.The walk took us around 2hrs - but apart from the paintings / photographs / video installation, we also heard many interesting stories from the modern Turkish history. I must also highlight the possibility to understand, how the people work in the gallery with blind kids - definitely ask for this opportunity (to hear how they do the exhibitions for them) - I dont want to spoil it now for you.I must strongly recommend visiting Istanbul in the winter - the weather was more than pleasant - around 16 - 17 C during the day with lots of sun and there was definitely less tourists then during top season months (so it was easier to go anywhere)."

The museum is in a huge warehouse along the wharf, sometimes almost dwarfed by cruise ships anchored next to it. The space inside is very well done--it's easy to wander and gaze at modern paintings with sculptures carefully placed. We always are interested in seeing contemporary painters, and this museum is well worth a visit by anyone interested in contemporary art."

There is always variety of amazing exhibitions to see and I can easily spend hours in there meandering through the spectacular works of art. It's easily accessible by a short walk from either Tophane or Findikli tram stops. I highly recommend this as a great way to spend time and to see the amazing exhibitions. Afterwards enjoy a tea in the Istanbul Modern restaurant to admire the Bosphorus views."

This is a gallery that has an good permanent collection and the temporary exhibitions are very interesting.

Do not leave without sampling their desserts, which are just spectacular. The art here is always worth a visit because they change it all the time, in order to keep up with the new artists.A great place."

What a great decision!After negotiating the flooded parking lot via pallets that had been thoughtfully placed by museum staff, we bought our tickets, checked our rain gear, and spent a morning browsing wonderful installations, paintings, photography and videos. Descriptions are in English and help to understand the art on display. Very enjoyable, kids would probably like it, too."

The ambition of Istanbul to be a great modern city is evident in this museum - and the shift from Ottoman culture in such a short space of time is striking. A variety of modern art styles and techniques is on display . Those who do not like modern art should avoid it - for those who do there is much to enjoy. Lunch on the terrace with panoramic Bosphorus views was a surprising bonus."

I had read in fodor's guidebook that it was turkey's first museum of modern art, so in we went. I make myself go to art galleries and although I don't understand or appreciate abstract art, I go because I believe it's good for my brain to absorb such. a wide variety of art, however, what the bonus for me happened to be downstairs, which was an incredible photography exhibition. it was stunning. dealt with the many situations in turkey. tough pics and incredibly well done.

Boasting a picturesque location on the shores of the Bosphorus and housed in a former warehouse, Istanbul Modern is well worth a visit. The permanent exhibition is small by international standards but it's meticulously curated. A focus on Turkish artists and perspectives allows for a fascinating insight into 20th century Turkish cultural history. I was especially moved by Kutlu\u011f Ataman\u2019s \"Women Who Wear Wigs\".Temporary exhibitions are housed downstairs. At the time we visited \"On The Road: Images of Turkey from the Nar Photos Archive\" was showing, an illuminating exhibition of photographs exploring multiple facets of contemporary Turkish urban and rural life. It\u2019s running until November 9, 2014, check it out if you get the chance.Heads up, it\u2019s closed on Mondays"

We have visited several museums of modern art and this one had the most enjoyable displays for the entire family. Even my daughter who is 5 enjoyed some of the displays immensely. However, the atmosphere of the museum is quite stressful. Security guards follow you around constantly and because we have children I think we constantly had one or two of them within 5 feet of us. At one point I had to speak to one of them to let them know that I was keeping an eye on my children and didn't need to be followed around as I was finding it quite difficult to enjoy the art. I did see several others who touched artwork so I understand that there are issues there, however, a more discreet and less intense monitoring of the areas would be most welcome. There needs to be a balance between enjoying art and preserving it. Moreover the staff was quite rude and unfriendly. I think the administration needs to step in and fix this problem."

Also, there's a cafe & restaurant on the sea front side with a successfull menu and great panorama balcony looking towards the old city and the start of the Bosphorus strait.

It is currently in an area being \"redeveloped\", but once inside it has all the ambience of being a modern, bright gallery with installations and exhibits that will appeal to a wide variety of visitors. In particular there was a temporary exhibition of contemporary photographs that appealed to me which gave a fascinating insight into Turkish life. However it's location on the coast gave it fabulous views and the restaurant offered us one of the best presented meals we had in the city. We were lucky enough to have timed our visit with that of a tall ship which added further interest to the view. We travelled from Old Town by taxi and it was \u00a310 TL each way. The tram also goes that way and sails through the terrible traffic, but for four people is actually more expensive (4x3TL)"

I could spend hours on the main floor alone, and downstairs, there were multiple other temporary exhibits. The museum is located on the water, so when you are finished or when you need a break, you can walk outside past the cafe and look out onto the water to both the Asian side of Istanbul and Sultanahmet.I spent several hours here and was not disappointed. I would have bought something from the gift shop, but I found that their most striking works were unavailable.

Many people will find these helpful; unfortunately, in my case, I found too many of them pretentious.There are a small number of late 19th century, early 20th century works by Turkish artists which may be out of place here, but these were the pieces I preferred.

The art is really eye catching and there are video exhibitions as well as paintings, sculptures and photography. There are iPads everywhere for you to use. I noticed on the safari app that the recent history included Nike, Facebook and YouTube. Some people must have been really bored! Some of the art is not for everyone but I would say most people would find something they liked in there. I for one liked the stairway to hell. The view is great. The cafe is decent too and our drinks came promptly despite being quite complicated. We didn't get any food. We did have a problem getting there though. The signs directed us to what looked like a car park so we walked around a bit. We found a strawberry on the ground but we couldn't find the art gallery. Eventually we went back to the car park and there it was in the corner."

Some are really quite exciting in both execution and in the texture of their reference to the culture of Istanbul, such as the volcanic representation of destruction by fire of Ottoman houses captured in pvc mosaics. Others update tropes of Western art, such as the bathing nudes squiggled in repeated wallpaper-like fashion, or another that uses the bathing nude to pose the question of voyeurism in the context of the orientalist view of Turkish women's sexuality represented by ideas of the harem. Still others are more abstract and universal, such as one composition of mirrors artfully arranged to both to limit and liberate the viewer's vista. A lot of the works currently on show - including several video-based installations - assert women's sexuality against a background identified as repressive paternalism and identifiable if one wishes with the most conservative elements in Turkey's current ruling \u00e9lite. The appeal of these works will perhaps depend on one's interest in and commitment to women's struggle for parity in modern Turkish society; but there is something here for everyone interested in contemporary art. The collection changes frequently (my wife was told some works she'd particularly liked on her last visit two years ago had moved on), and there is something for everyone, but you'll like it best if you're genuinely interested in the Istanbul and Turkish angle on contemporary ways of seeing. And one way of seeing we found difficult to manage was the view of the Bosphorus, as it was largely blocked by a gargantuan cruise ship tied up at the berth below. Recommended - but don't pay just to see the view!"

They seem to be very anxious about guests taking photographs, so much that I had my own security guard stalker following my every move, staring me down while I tried to enjoy the art. It's really obnoxious. Also, they will accost you if you do not wear the red sticker they give you at the entrance (I suppose to keep restaurant customers from visiting the museum without paying), but the stickers don't stick and are constantly falling off. This museum is beautiful but I cannot say that I felt welcome there. The cinema is an enjoyable experience which is why I gave it an average rating.

Also away from the crowds, a peaceful and spacious interior setting for nicely displayed and signed artwork. I was pleased to see a neon sign piece that had been featured in a travel magazine article .  The location near the cruise ship harbor is a bit hidden from the main street ard directions not well signed, but we persisted through a square of seedy bar./cafes for hookah smoking (think handy to day trippers off the cruise ships) through a warehouse passageway and found it. Worth the hunt.I also recommend the cafe in the museum for very good food served attractively by an efficient waitstaff. The only negative was having the view blocked by a mammoth cruise ship outside the restuarant window . "

Lots of freakish paintings where the topic or items were unfathomable, which you will not mistaken for a Vermeer.

The museum is between the Findikli and Tophane stations of the T1 line (nearer to Tophane). I advise that visitors near to Taksim take the funicular to Kabatas station and walk the way (circa 20 minutes) and take in the view. the entrance fee as of August 2013 was 15TL for ordinary people like me.

The exhibit focuses on paintings and video -- other media formats are lightly handled. But the video exhibits are contemporary and thought-provoking, and the selection of paintings is consistently good. The narratives for each installation are helpful and well-written.The temporary exhibits, especially those on the lower level, had eye-candy appeal, but did not touch the same intellectual nerve as those in the permanent wing. Still, for the entrance price, they were worth the wander, and I am sure these will only improve as the museum's efforts grow.Suggestion: If you're in Istanbul in the summer, save the museum for an afternoon trip. You'll appreciate the air conditioning, and the easy pace of the atmosphere. A nice respite from the city outside."

Some exhibits were very interesting, the others less but all in all it is one of the contemporary and modern art museums that every European capital or large city intends to have. Nice restaurant/caf\u00e9 with the view over Fatih and the Asian part of the city (certainty if there if there is no cruise ship blocking in the view)."

We saw the Past and Future exhibition and were introduced to some excellent 20th century Turkish artists such as Burhan Dogancay and the 1914 generation. The exhibits downstairs weren't great. Learned about taxidermy though through a surprisingly interesting video (still not sure if it was a video installation on taxidermy or just a movie from the museum). Worth a detour if you like art and would like to see something different (and particularly if you like taxidermy videos)."

This time I went there, there were Egyptian naval officers visiting the museum and me and my friends had a chance to chat with the soldiers. Looking back now, I realise that that was just before things started again in Egypt. Anyways, Istanbul Modern is a great place with always new comtemporary art to show. 2 thumbs up, 5 stars!"

The terrace restaurant overlooking the mouth of the Golden Horn was an excellent spot for long lunch. (Be sure to reserve your table ahead of time as it fills up at lunch.)

Of course, there were those pictures that looked like a kindergarten class group project, but there was more than that too. In particular I was very impressed with many of the 3D displays. One was a mosaic of a shark in the ocean composed of clothing tags pinned and measuring something like 10 x 8 feet. Another was a sphere that reached from floor to ceiling made up of smaller one foot balls that were tied together and suspended by ropes anchored all the way around the room on the ceiling, walls, and floor. The roof in the library was designed by hanging books very close to each other from strings. I think my favorite was a collection of vintage suitcases, chairs, and artistic replicas with all sorts of movable, mounted magnifying glasses that provided many opportunities for new perspectives. I really enjoyed our visit.Ticket: 15 TL"

You pay for the view and not so much for the food. The food is a bit overpriced and the portions are not very big. It may get a bit chilly, so I suggest bringing a light cardigan when sitting outside, although you have the option to eat inside as well. The museum also has a small library of books with places to study.

If you are looking for a contrast to the ancient and traditional art that surrounds your every move in Istanbul then take the tramway over to the Istanbul Modern. The day I visited the museum it was completely dwarfed by the monstrous cruise ship parked along side but the ship could not overpower the art work inside. The current show, a retrospective of the museum's holdings was smartly filling all the galleries which have an excellent layout and flow. No crowds. No long lines. Easy to find from the land side but often hidden from the waterside because of the huge cruise ships. A refreshing setting for contemporary art\u2014somewhat like dental floss for your eyes and mind. Makes the rest of Istanbul look all that much better. Combine your time here (at least 1.5 hours) with a trip up the hill to the SALT gallery on Istiklal."

It ended up being one of our favorite things in Turkey! First, realize that the \"free on Thursday\" is for Turkish citizens only. No discount for \"students\" if not Turkish citizens. I do think that maybe children under 12 of any citizenship might be free???I would really recommend taking the time to scan the descriptions posted next to each painting or work of art. The first paragraph with each work of art is about the artist....I found that to be information I could skip. But the SECOND paragraph explained the thought behind the artwork. Really amazing insight into what is important to modern Turks socially and culturally, and what is on their minds. I mean, really REALLY interesting. The artwork ranges from lovely to choke-back-a-snort-of-laughter crazy. Much is very thought-provoking. Nothing about this place is heavy-handed or pretentious. There are short films in little alcoves with dark curtains for doors that range from funny to thought-provoking to \"HUH?!?\" Again, read the explanation posted next to the door before going in or you will be scratching your head for sure. Be sure to go downstairs where (I think) they house travelling or temporary exhibits. The absolute wackiest stuff was down there (as well as a really thought-provoking photo exhibit that had our family discussing everything from Chernobyl to the BP oil spill to how America is perceived overseas to business women in the Arab world). I mean, really out-right laughing with glee stuff. There are some candy machines in a little glassed in area off the lower level for if you're starving at some point. A happy bonus is that the first floor is right on the Bosporus and has the most AMAZING view of Istanbul, especially the point of land that has the Topkapi Palace. There is a cafe there that looked luscious and if it wasn't raining we absolutely we would have sat down and enjoyed the view and either had a meal or else just a cup of tea. Figure a half day to enjoy this if you reading the descriptions. We went in the afternoon (again, dodging the rainy weather that day) and found it to be perfect because it was uncrowded and we had no time constraints and could relax and not look at the time."

It's got a great view right on the Bosphorus near Dolmabahce palace. There is a student discount. You must check your bags at the cloak room.The cafe is a bit expensive, and you have to walk through a parking lot and vehicle gate to get in from the street, as the building is geared more towards vehicles than pedestrians.

In our guide book it stated that on Thursday admission was free but this is now only for Turkish citizens. It has a good shop and an interesting looking cafe though we did not have time to eat there. There are cloakroom facilities but beware the moody and unhelpful attendants! We instead ate a delicious meze meal at Karakoy Murat Muhallebicisi before visiting - 2 plates of hearty Turkish fare for 20 TL so very good value and service with a smile - I recommend eating here if you're in the area."

The interior space and layout of the collection is outstanding. We particularly liked some of the video installations, many by women artists challenging traditional roles. One particular video installation on what I'll call \"dancing land mines\" really caused the viewer to think about the subject. There is a nice if a bit pricey cafe there with spectacular views out over the Bosphorus. A great way to spend a rainy or chilly day getting to know a little more about the history of Istanbul, particularly in the last half of the twentieth century."

One is the Gallery, the other the cafe/restaurant. I must they the choices for the Gallery have been very distinct and fulfilling. The Gallery is spacious and serves its exhibitions rather well. Coming to the restaurant I must add it has an amazing view over a bustling and historic part of the Bosphorus and hence Istanbul. The view expands to partly to \"Karak\u00f6y\", the Historic Peninsula and Sirkeci (places one should definitely stroll through). The menu is very balanced with various taste directions and the service is wonderful. True, it may get busy and you may not end up at the forefront of ther view but still the ambiance is relaxing and enjoyable. From the restaurant you have direct access to the gallery. Modern Istanbul is also superbly situated. a short stroll from different corners and sites of the city. It is easily accesible (relatively compared to the general layout of Istanbul's many sites). A visit could be combined with another visit to the nearby \"Tophane-i Amire\" (historic building worth a visit, used for exhibitions as well), or to some mosques, or what not else. Again a visit can stretch an interest from a solitude-seeking art connoiseur to a famliy willing to spend a nice time surrounded by food and art.Have fun!"

Exactly the way it should be.Admission is not a problem, free wardrobe is a charming plus, but then it all goes terribly wrong. From the moment you walk in, you feel like a prisoner. There is security staff in every area an trust me, they are not shy. It's absolutely impossible to get an experience in this place. Not mention if you, put off by the constant supervision, should want to check your mails or if you get a text from a friend, then they rush forward, loudly and clearly stating \"NO PICTURES, NO PICTURES\". Here's a bit of advice to the people runninght e museum. If you want to make Istanbul Modern a museum of the same ranks as the ones in other big cities, you have to change your mentality. Totally. For now, it's a joke. Who can take in pieces of art in this environment? A last tip for you as a visitor as well, make sure you put your big, red sticker on your forehead, because otherwise the staff will also hunt you down to see your ticket.

This modern art museum is a short walk from the tram line (Tophane stop on the Kabatas line), sandwiched between ancient buildings and the waterfront, a stone's throw from the cruise ship pier. Possibly inspired by the Tate Modern in London, this very up-to-date museum is in a converted industrial building on the waterfront, with some spectacular views of the Golden Horn and Bosphorus. Appropriately, the museum features work by young Turkish artists, complemented by a good selection of modern international works. After visiting numerous Byzantine and Ottoman sites, it's refreshing to step into a starkly modern setting showcasing some really thought-provoking pieces, such as a silent film depicting political upheaval during the 1960s. There is also an excellent cafe with outdoor seating overlooking the Bhosphorus) where you can enjoy a break while processing some of the exhibits, as well as a well stocked museum shop. An excellent way to spend half a day or so in Istanbul."

This is a great opportunity to see a side of Istanbul that is not that evident. The art is phenomenal and world class and ranges from art from the Ottoman era to the present. There are different areas and the art includes: paintings, installation, video and other forms and there are both temporary and permanent exhibits. There is a great but pricey restaurant/ cafe and a gift shop. There is also a research library for visiting scholars of Turkish art and artitsts. The museum was a gift to Istanbul and the world from the Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 family who were prominent industrialists and the works are from their private collection. This museum is one of 4 that I love to visit when I am in istanbul, the others being: the Sabanci museum, the Pera Museum and Santral, all in diverse parts of Istanbul. All of them are examples of philanthropy filling the gaps that the State increasingly refuses to fill. As for the person who didnt like the cruise ships docked there, I think it adds a pleasantly surrealistic side. By the way, when you leave the museum walk to Karakoy and you will see a side of Istanbul that is historic and may not be there much longer if the developers gentrify it."

The Istanbul Modern hides behind a mosque currently under restoration, so apart from a few distinctive red and white signs, you would never know it was there.... which is a shame. A mere 15 lira to get in, the place is a delight. packed with a vast collection of painting, sculpture, installations, concept pieces, light projections and much more, from Turkish and international artists. Easy to spend a long day here if you wander, read a lot of the info boards, and take to the cafe, with a stunning view of the Bosphorous, for a lunch midway through- however be warned, you pay for the view- a light lunch with a drink will cost you about 30 Lira per head (but the food is quite superb, and there is some pretty cool backing music, or you can eat locally within 200 metres once you come out). The gift shop has a few cheap postcards and a lot of very expensive memorabilia (one of the areas where they copy the Tate Modern and SF MOMA). A great day out if the rain is falling or you have old-world fatigue and need a change of scene. Not really suitable for children, although there is no age restrictionCheck the website before going- at present IM is closed on a Monday and open until 8pm on a Thursday. Wheelchair access is possible (there is a lift), but on a very crowded day you may not see much. There is a lot of parking outside, or it is a short walk from the Tophane stop on the Tramvay system from Kabatas. Photography is not allowed in the gallery, by the way"

I don't know anything about Turkish politics, but it seems most of the artists represented by this museum have a LOT to say about their history, struggle, placement, whatever. In general, I would say it IS worth the price of admission because there are some real treasures (like the piano suspended by three helium balloons). There was a terrible video playing an incessant Ping-Pong-Ping electronic sound at a high pitch in the main space and you could hear it throughout the museum. It was grating. Unfortunately when we were there the entire subfloor exhibition space was preparing for a new show, including the photography, so even though our admission was reduced I felt what WAS available wasn't enough. If nothing else, the views of the water are sensational, and one should always support art wherever one finds it. I would, however, suggest the art advocate leave the museum and head up Bogazkesen and get a gallery map of the area. Take the road all the way up the hill (way way way up) and then walk the full length of Istiklal Avenue, being sure not to miss SALT Beyoglu Gallery. Give yourself at least a full day to see the art in this area, and bring GOOD walking shoes."

The museum store was lovely as well bought some cool items there.

A great place to pick up Turkish music, I bought two mixes from the legendary nightclub Babylon. Also, the restaurant it the perfect place to have lunch, the food is delicious, but it's the setting that shines. We would definitely visit this place again.

We were utterly entranced with its exhibits of contemporary and modern Turkish art. In particular we enjoyed the New Works, New Horizons exhibit which is an excellent overview of the evolution of modern and contemporary Turkish art. There were also excellent exhibits of contemporary Chinese art and of portrait photography. We were somewhat less enchanted by the Istanbul Design Biennale exhibit which included a cacophony of design ideas, but a few very worthwhile exhibits including an interactive exhibit on how various urban factions approach the design process. The Biennale is a separate admission and I'd only recommend it if you have lots of time. The museum is easy reached at the Tophane Tram 1 stop from the Old City."

We took the ferry from Eminou to Karakoy and enjoyed the 10 minute walk parallel to the river to the museum. The show was generally very good. It is definitely accessible to English-speakers. Some of the installations were a little too reliant on text. I'm sure if our knowledge of Istanbul was deeper we would have grasped more of the nuance but as it was we found it to be cool and thought-provoking. Some of the installations are very interactive. Don't miss the one where you can alter the city skyline depending on whether you are a politician, and NGO, a tourist, etc. Brilliant concept and execution. We were a little taken aback that after spending 20 TL each on tickets to the Biennial they wanted another 8 TL apiece to see the rest of the museum. That seemed a bit like chiseling. Also, the staff was a bit on the too-cool side. I used to work a contemporary art museum and I'm all too familiar with the phenomenon. It was more jarring than usual because of the unusual graciousness of the rest of the folks we've encountered in Turkey. Hipsters, ugh.We had an excellent but expensive lunch in the museum cafe. The view across the Bosphorus was spectacular. The service was clunky, but friendly."

Many artists I've never heard of, but truly, truly talented artisans.The museum is laid out very well and there weren't many people there even though it was a rainy day. We had planned on staying an hour or so and ended up walking out over three hours later. We lingered at so many beautiful, thought provoking pieces that we just lost track of time. GO, GO, GO!"

Exhibitions were interesting and educational. Everything was in Turkish and English. Much to our surprise we discovered the modern museum had an excellent restaurant (expensive) on a deck overlooking the water. The seafood rizotto was as good as any I have ever had. It is located where all the cruise ships dock. I enjoyed this visit far more than viewing antiquities."

After being completely worn out from the mosques and traditional art and palaces, etc, etc, I had to get out and see something more contemporary. This museum is a true breath of fresh air. A bright airy building, right on the water, with a fine collection of Turkish art, and rotating exhibitions from other international art museums. I saw a well-curated photography exhibition about portraiture, and a fascinating show on contemporary Chinese art. The restaurant there was excellent - huge wine list - but it was also OK to just sit out on the terrace, overlooking the boats, and sip an espresso. It seemed very popular with the locals on the weekend, too. Can't go wrong with a visit. I think it's one of the top museums in the city."

While one of the exhibits going on when I was there was a Turkish artist who liked NYC subway art, most of the art in the museum feels totally different to me. All kinds of textures and treatments you don't see in Paris or the US. While you're there, have lunch on their terrace with fabulous views and home made pasta. For me, it was a welcome relief from the heat and humidity. Just a 5-10 minute walk from the Metro/Tophane stop, so it's easy to get to, even in the heat. If you're into art, it's a great option in a place where everything else is 1500 years old."

Although lots of people have given good reviews of Istanbul Modern, I see it more as a nice break, get out of the sun, and see something different from the Byzantine and Ottoman monuments. However, upon seeing the collection, the first impression is that the contemporary art scene inTurkey still has a long way to go--most of the pieces in the collection are derivative, second-rate copies of western artistic movements. The best aspect of the museum is the library's collection of photographs, especially the documentary work from the 1930s and '40s. Spend an hour or two there and you will make the visit worth while."

And if you prefer self interpretation, don't read the plaque. Huge! It was two large floors that took over three hours to go through and we rushed through the second floor. True turkish artist. I've gone to many museums where the art was foreign. This museum has at least 50% of it of Turkish artists. Very cool to see a different perspective in art. Restaurant upstairs is amazing. You can sit there and have an expensive cup of tea and not lose much lira but can relax with an amazing view of the bosphorus. Not crowded! It was a peaceful environment to view and enjoy art. Cons:Out of the way. Though, I guess if you're on a cruise, it is pretty close to a major port. A bit hard to find. The entry is next to a large parking lot so it feels like you're entering a controlled company lot or something like that."

There is real potential here, but for now the price is extremely reasonable, the bar and restaurant cannot be missed and the museum an oasis of modernism in a city steeped in ancient history.

This beautiful museum is housed in a converted warehouse on the Bosphorus near the Galata Bridge. Stepping into it, I was reminded of the Dia in New York but with views of the Mamara and not the Hudson. Visiting the modern helped give me perspective of the growth of Turkish art from the times of the Sultans to recent graduates of the design school next door. They were showing the progression of Turkish modern art over the last 100 years, which was very facinating. Don't miss out on the photogrophy downstairs as well!"

It is very well curated. They have another show from Holland that we found a bit odd. The permanent collection display was quite good. The museum is very near a long line of hooka places which looked like fun. Lots of people sitting outside in the sun and visiting over coffee an tea. The building is quite lovely and they have a restaurant that looks out over the water. The only challenge with it is that the cruise ships dock in front of it and completely block the view (bad planning!) so check to make sure there is no cruise ship docked the day you go."

We had heard that the museum was free on Thursdays, so were disappointed to learn this is only for Turkish residents. The art collection is huge, two floors worth, and we didn't manage to get to it all, so allow yourself plenty of time for your visit. We stopped at the cafe/bar for a drink afterwards, spectacular views, as the museum is situated right on the bank of the Bosphorus. However, beware the prices, 18TL for a glass of wine, though a nice treat."

Furthermore it had variety of art such as photography, video, installations and more which made the visit richer. I specially enjoyed the exhibition by Turkish women which is excellent, provocative, creative and beautiful.Don't miss the cafe, the food there is excellent and the service is good. In addition you have a wonderful view over the Bosporus. It would be worth it just going to the cafe;-)"

I have been to almost every major museum of contemporary art in the Western world and Istanbul Modern may easily be counted among the top five. Exhibition curatorship for the Dream and Reality exhibition of art by Turkish women was extremely well thought out. The Museum itself is huge. Two other shows were being presented concomitantly with this one - a photography show (Uncanny Encounters, the weakest of the three) and a selection of contemporary work by Turkish artists called New Works, New Horizons). We attended several films in the AFRIKA! retrospective (a rather idisoyncratic selection of African cinema covering over 25 years of film by well-known directors including the extraordinary Mahamat Saleh-Haroun and Ousmane Sembene. Subtitles in English AND Turkish. Films were shown in a very comfortable theater and admission to them was FREE with admission to the museum. As for the museum restaurant, this was really special. Food was delicious, drinks top notch, service impeccable and the view of the Bosphorous breathtaking. This view, by the way, is incorporated in the architecture of part of the exhibition space, running along one whole side of the building. Not to be missed under any circumstances. Thought-provoking contemporary art in a magical setting."

Talk to the manager and reserve a window table for your lunch. Or sit outside if it is warm and sunny. I did not really get off on Turkish contemporary art: it seems slavishly derivative of western contemporary art but these are early days still and great things may occur here in future.

Istanbul has a rich cultural history in modernity and is booming on the contemporary scene, with a multiplicity of galleries and art spaces, additionally to the Istanbul Biennale. Istanbul Modern is definitely a must see space. It's situated on the docks, over the Bosphorus. The main floor houses a permanent collection of Turkish art from the late 19th century till today. Although the names of the artists might seem unfamiliar for foreigners, the artworks are of great quality, some are really masterpieces and can easily compete with European and American art of the same period. Collections include paintings, photographs, sculptures, videos and installations. The lower level hosts temporary exhibitions (sometimes of international standard). The museum has a mediatheque, a design store and an excellent restaurant. The whole experience is awesome and makes of Istanbul Modern a major venue for the arts."

We didn't expect all that when we decided to go there on a rainy September day, just to pass a few hours till the rain subsides. But the minute we got in we simply forgot all about the rain and the outside world, and just submersed ourselves into the fascinating exhibitions on show. After 3 hours and very sore feet we concluded this place is worth more than one visit on a rainy day, and not only because the beautiful cafeteria porch with it's lovely view was closed due to the weather... Art lovers, this is a gem worth visiting."

It is extremely easy to get to on the public tram (figure this out if you haven't already -- 1.50 Lira, clean easy and much safer and faster than any taxi ride) then walk 2 blocks to the location. Have tea (or a meal) at the lovely restaurant on the water.

This private museum is definitely not the match for the generally expected impression of Istanbul: it's not about the oriental art, it's not about the ottoman, roman or greek art, it's not about the atmosphere in the 1001 nights tales.... It's a totally different, contemporary building exhibiting the contemporary art of Turkey and it's one of the \"must see\"s in Istanbul. It's situated at the port, thus, for those who come to Istanbul with cruises, it's just in walking distance. There is a permanent contemporary Turkish painting exhibition in the museum and usually 2 or 3 temporary exhibitions, one always about photographing art. The library of the museum is quite rich in terms of reference art books and is also decoration wise very creative. There is a special playground for children where the Museum also offers art programs for free for children during weekends. There are also chamber music concerts or art related conferences or panels in the Museum at certain dates. The museum shop is a nice spot to get both souvenirs about exhibitions but also to find tools and plays to motivate kids and youngsters into artistic activities. The restaurant of the Museum is an extremely nice place, with a gorgeous view -if there is not an embarked cruise at the port tough- and delicious food. One does not have to necessarily visit the exhibitions to go this restaurant, at the entrance, all you have to do is to indicate you go to the restaurant only to get there without paying the museum entrance fee. I recommend this Museum wholeheartedly to get an idea about the modern art in Turkey."

Located on the waterfront a 15 minute walk from the nearest tram stop. The museum is set back from the main road so you will have to walk in the entrance for cars and pass the parking booth attendant to get there. The exhibits when we were there in September 2006 included Turkish modern art organized by theme (landscape, figures, abstract, women) and a great exhibit on photography. The gift shop at the museum was small and we tried the restaurant at the museum for lunch. The food was fine though probably a little pricey compared to other places nearby. If you need a breath of modern air after much ancient exploring this is a nice place to do it. Also just walking around the surrounding neighborhood, up up the steep hill was enjoyable. Seeing the real Istanbul where kids are playing the street and old men sitting on their stoops watching the day go by."

            "review": "Worth The Trip!. Housed in a renovated warehouse right on the Bosporus, Istanbul Modern is a delightful counterpoint to the many ruins, mosques, palaces and bazaars that are the mainstay of the Istanbul tourist experience. Don't be dissuaded by the \"Modern\" title. While it has many similarities to the better-known MOMA in NYC, it's not all funky soup cans and avante-garde art installations. Indeed, you have to put 'modern' in the context of Istanbul/Constantinople. In a city with buildings and cultures that are thousands of years old, \"modern\" becomes a relative term. The Istanbul Modern collection highlights notable Turkish artists from the late 1800's through to present day.One remarkable painting on display is a self-portrait by Sultan Abdul Mejid II, the last Caliph of the Ottoman Dynasty. Born in 1868, he and his family were expelled from Turkey in 1924 when the Caliphate was abolished. He was an accomplished painter and served as Chairman of the Ottoman's Artist's Society, not roles I would have expected of a Sultan!For me, the highlight was the special exhibit of 35 photographs by Andreas Gursky a renown German photographer (it's a temporary exhibit through Aug 2007). Even if you don't like \"art\", it's worth the trip just to see these incredible photos. They are simply breath-taking. They are HUGE, the biggest being 2 by 5 meters (6 by 16 feet)!! The depth of field, perspective, and resolution of these large-format images are amazing. If you've ever taken a tourist snapshot with your trusty 5 megapixel camera (and who hasn't), you'll be in awe of these photographs and leave the exhibit shaking your head wondering how Gursky created them.Your last stop at Istanbul Modern should be the caf\u00e9, on the second floor overlooking the Bosporus. You can have lunch or a mid-afternoon snack (I highly recommend the almond souffl\u00e9) while watching the boats big and small pass by. It's a delightful place to relax and recharge your batteries before heading back out to the crowded bazaars and mosques. Note that Istanbul Modern is on the waterfront just a short walk from the Karak\u00f6y cruise ship terminal. If you are departing Istanbul on a cruise, I suggest you check in early, dump your bags, and then spend an hour or two wandering through this marvelous museum. You can probably watch your cruise ship loading supplies as you sip a Turkish coffee in the caf\u00e9."
