            "review": "Peaceful and Beautiful Respite from Busy Istanbul. Tucked away off the major tourist center of Sultanahmet, the Kucuk Ayasofya Camii (Little Ayasofya Mosque) is about a 7-8 minute walk from the main square. Built by Justinian in the 6th century, it is said to be the prototype for the much-larger Aya Sofia in Sultanahmet Square.The 7-8 minute walk will take you along well-traveled streets lined with a mix of shops and restaurants catering to both tourists and locals, and a few hotels.It was converted (as the Aya Sofia was) to a mosque after Constantinople fell to Mehmet the Conquerer in 1453. Kucuk Ayasofya is a working mosque; women are required to dress appropriately with headscarves; shoes are removed in the little alcove just inside the entrance - there's a convenient cubby-hole system along one wall to place your shoes until you are ready to leave. You'll see an older ablution fountain with a (non-working) hand pump on the inside - the current washing fountains are outside the structure in the courtyard.Elements of when the Greeks held the city are evident in the 'Greek key' architectural details, and you can climb the short flight of stairs to a platform and overlook the interior. Not many tourists, therefore very peaceful inside. Shades of cream and blue abound, and the interior design work of carvings, tiles, and paintings are not as overwhelming as some of the larger mosques. The cream and blue colors reminded us of Greece; as this was a Greek church for centuries, perhaps this is color scheme was an intentional choice.We can't say for certain if there was an entrance fee - we were so taken in by how lovely the mosque is - we recall leaving a 10 TL each donation (as of June 2016, ~$3.42), but due to our limited understanding of Turkish were not sure if that was an entrance fee or not.In many ways, we found Kucuk Ayasofya more beautiful than the better-known Aya Sofia because it is smaller, much less crowded, and it you can get much closer to see the beautiful tilework and architectural details. And, as long as there are no prayer services, you can sit as long as you like and enjoy the serenity."

            "review": "Beautiful Byzantine Church now a Mosque again.. This is so like a small version of Aya Sofya, it was an obvious name to adopt ('kucuk' meaning small) and obvious that a story would develop that it was a model for the actual Aya Sofya. It is a beautiful example of a 6th century church, dedicated to 2 Christian Roman soldiers, although all the Byzantine mosaics and frescos were removed in the 16th century when it was converted into an Ottoman mosque. But the beautiful pillars and their intricately carved capitals, and the Greek friezes above them were left undamaged, either by the Ottomans or the more recent renovations. Although technically a museum since the Republic was formed in 1922, it seems to have again become a mosque after renovation, meaning ladies must now cover up and making viewing tricky on a Friday But definitely worth a visit. Make sure you go upstairs (but be careful on worn steps)."

We began our explorations today at the K\u0215\u00e7\u0215k Ayasofya Mosque, built in the Sixth Century by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian as a church honoring Saints Sergius and Bacchus, the Fourth Century Roman Christian martyrs who appeared to the emperor in a dream. Because the \u201cLittle Hagia Sophia,\u201d as it is known, retains the architectural features of the original church, it struck us as an example of the Ottoman practice of re-purposing Christian religious structures, often whitewashing over mosaics and frescoes, rather than tearing churches down to build mosques. Whether this practice demonstrated tolerance or frugality, it was a treat to see the surviving examples of Byzantine art."

I think it is worth going out of one's way to visit because of the Byzantine architecture and the building's history. The red-brick structure features an imposing dome and an irregular octagon shape. Inside, big columns remain from the building's days as a church. Justinian and his wife, Theodora, built the little church at some point between 527 and 536, just before Justinian's massive Aya Sofya went up. The minaret and madrasah, now used for other purposes, date from the church's conversion to a mosque in 1500.The mosque proved to be extremely quiet. Only one other person joined us inside. We took about 10 minutes to look around and then left for the small tea room that occupies part of the former madrasah. The tea was good; the WC proved to be in deplorable condition."

Small mosque but beautifully decorated. We were allowed to go upstairs where usually the muezzin (the person who makes the call to prayer) stands and take a few photographs from different angles.Usually very quiet as we didn't see many tourists there, so very different from the Blue Mosque in that way!If you're visiting the Blue Mosque, make your way here after (about a 5 minute walk) - it's worth it!"

The buildings are similar in design but each has their own individuality. The church has an irregular plan.Four octagonal pillars, around the top of which are inscriptions that honour Justinian, his wife Theodora and St Sergius, support the vaulted central dome. The gallery above affords an excellent view of the interior which was decorated with coloured marble facings and lavishly decorative golden mosaics. The church was converted to a mosque shortly after Mehmet's conquest of the city.The mosque is located beyond the southern end of the Arasta Bazaar, along Ayasofya Cadd. It can also be accessed from the sea front, past the Bucoleon Palace, via a tunnel under the railway line. "

Expect to remove your shoes too, I left mine outside with no issue.It was my first trip to a mosque and I was a little unsure (worried to ignorantly offend if I'm honest), but it is a quiet area away from the hustle and the 'process' for visiting is clearly marked out on helpful signs to allow you to get on with it respectfully.It's a beautiful building and quite old - I specifically visited in order to see the Byzantine frieze that runs beneath the gallery inside.

Built by Justinian in the 6th century. It is a two-story building and one can get a better view of the interior from the second floor. The tops of the columns (capitals) are intricately carved and are some of the most beautiful I have ever seen. It was a really nasty day so we were the only ones in the mosque and could really take our time to look around. This is the only Mosque in the world with Latin inscriptions inside (owing to its earlier Church history.) The next time I'm in Turkey I plan on going to this Church again to spend more time on the exterior of the building because as I said it was a really nasty day."

You can see the roof from the Blue Mosque when looking towards the bay. There are likely to be worshippers here, so respect is needed but it all adds to the experience. However the architecture is delightful. When you have visited, adjacent is a veranda garden with gifts etc and, more so, tasty tea at 1TL /glass which you will enjoy. The general Kumkapi residential neighbourhood is also interesting to wander around."

It is not well known and it is not on the normal tourist path , in fact it is a good 20 minutes from the blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia ( the Big one ) . If you have time and you do not mind walking , it is worth the detour but do not expect to be amazed !!!"

Near our hotel in the lower western reaches of the Sultanahmet and just a few more yards past our favourite fish restaurant during our stay and an example of a smaller converted Byzantine church \u2013 everything was going for it. We were not disappointed. This beautifully proportioned space is decorated minimally compared to the bigger and more visited attractions and is all the more appealing (and more refreshing) for that. The many fewer visitors allow the reasonable chance of photos without the intrusion of the human figure and the possibility to roam all over the building, to the gallery, to the top of the added enclosure etc which allows many viewpoints such that you start to notice things like the edges of vertical surfaces that are sculpted and decorated to look like drawn-back curtains and the fact that the building is not quite true on its axis. The intimacy of the smaller space and the more restrained decoration soon made us warm to this building; maybe we felt it as a bit more European than Eastern, a bit more retaining of its Christian heritage despite its conversion to a mosque? Outside there is almost a cloisters containing the ablutions station with retail outlets offering ceramics, glassware, literature, refreshments etc. and in the nearby streets are some interesting local artists working away in their studios and selling their art. After the hectic confusion and bustle of the larger monuments, this quiet and serene tucked-away jewel of a building is a tonic for wearying sight-seers"

If you like to walk among the near streets of Istanbul and you're looking for extra important historical sightseeing, you shouldn't miss the so-called Small Aya Sofia. It's situated in a peaceful part of Istanbul, away from crowded spaces and hords of tourists. You'll be given a chance to visit a significant historical place, an ex-church, converted to a mosque. Why do I say that the 'chance is given'? It's because it's completely opened to tourists, even though the Kucuk Ayasofya is still a regular mosque. The exterior and interior of the mosque are really interesting and amazing, so you won't regret visiting this place. Also, at the entrance of the mosque there are free prospects which are related to Islam (written in different languages). At the end of the Kucuk Ayasofya tour, you can take a pause and rest a bit in the shades of trees surrounding the mosque."

It's free!My advice for this building and all the buildings of this amazing city:Join in... don't be shy.Wash you feet under the taps on the building opposite the main door outside to save the carpet. (Feet can get very swetty in istanbul. It won't kill you and it's actually really refreshing.)Go inside, forget tourism, put your camera in your pocket, then quietly sit on the carpet and contemplate your existence.You may take home something really special and get far more from your visit to Istanbul than just photos.That's has after all been the real purpose of all these beautiful buildings in Istanbul for thousands of years...."

Little Ayasofia (k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck ayasofia) is a much smaller temple but its interior is better conserved - you can look at the inscriptions in Greek. The church has an octogonal plan with beautiful columns and wall paintings, and a gallery that provides a great view from a different angle.It is interesting to see how the mirhab (the central piece where the faithful offer their prayers) had been built. Since the church was built without Mecca in mind and the mirhab has to be oriented towards Mecca, the solution was to place it off center.Little Ayasofia (k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck ayasofia) is located in the Sultanahmed region but removed from the main attractions around its larger sister. No tour buses seem to stop there so you can enjoy a quiet visit.

It dates back to the 600 AD era, but is very well restored and is a fully functioning Mosque, so no traces of its early Christian heritage remain, unless you look closely at some of the carved lettering along the balcony edge, which are in Latin and Greek. Some bright spark had the idea of building a railway line in 1870 some two metres form the structure and the resulting vibrations almost destroyed it.

In the cloister area outside is the station where worshipers wash themselves before entering the mosque and a small cemetery. The inside of the mosque is tranquil and peaceful with beautiful windows and painted ceilings. The Imam was there to show people around and he insisted that we go upstairs to get a better look. The mosque is carpeted, but under the carpet you can feel the uneven stones that have been worn down over the centuries. After the crowds at other mosques and churches I had visited, this was a pleasant And meaningful interlude. There is no admission, but you will probably want to leave a donation to help with preservation. I highly recommend a visit!"

The stairs up are sometimes broken and the handrail is best irgnored but you can have a totally different perspective on a mosque from the gallery.

The only thing that bothers me about the \"restorations\" of mosques in Istanbul is that rather than maintaining the historic feel, they tend to repaint in a way that makes the interior look like it's fresh out of the box and a look at the pictures tells me it's happened here too.There's not an official fee but it's good to make a donation.The small madrassah across the way is a lovely quite place to have tea, enjoy the flowers and talk with people who practice and teach traditioal Ottoman crafts."

It was late in the afternoon and it was only me in the building. A very polite man, who was obviously looking after the mosque, invited me to get inside as I was not sure whether I was allowed to. I only had to take my shoes off (I was not asked to cover my head) and then to step inside. I was charmed by what I saw: it was an impressive mixture of two religious cultures. The building is a mosque now but the original architecture has survived remarkably well, not like the original interior decoration. It must have been a beautiful church \u2013 with the elegant two-storey colonnade and walls covered in golden mosaics (like those that survived from this period in Ravenna) and probably frescoes as well. The capitals of the marble columns are splendid and still bear the monograms of Justinian and Theodora. It was interesting to learn that this edifice is even older that one of the present museum Haghia Sophia. It was begun by Justinian and his Empress Theodora in 527, five years before the commencement of the building of Haghia Sofia itself. Likely, the Sains Sergius and Bacchus was a model for St Sophia. Today, it is also known as the Little Haghia Sophia because of its resemblance to the Great Church.SS. Sergius and Bacchus served as a church for nearly 1,000 years after its founding, but then in the first decade of the sixteenth century it was converted into a mosque. SS. Sergius and Bacchus were two Roman soldiers martyred for their espousal of Christianity. The saints were especially dear to Justinian because they saved his life some years before he came to the throne. It was my last day of our five days break in Istanbul and was really glad that I didn\u2019t miss seeing this church. It is just less than a 10 minutes\u2019 walk from the Hippodrome and 5 minutes from our Dara Hotel. The area, where the church is located, is residential and it\u2019s pretty nice to see how people live there. To me this church-mosque is one of the most charming architectural treasures in Istanbul."

It is a smaller version of the magnificent Hagia Sophia but is used as a mosque. The icons and Byzantine paintings and designs have been removed. Another reason to visit is the traditional and lively neighborhood around the mosque."

These saints were Roman soldiers who converted to Christianity and later were martyred for their faith. Justinian credited the intercession of these saints for saving his life when he was falsely accused of treason before he became emperor. A thousand years later, after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, the church was converted into a mosque. The original architectural designs and structures have survived. The original mosaics and frescoes are gone, but the Islamic decorative designs and colors are striking. Kucuk Ayasofya (Little Hagia Sofia) is located very close to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia. It will add to your understanding and appreciation of both buildings."

An off the beaten track attraction, it's not a must see on a short visit but it's worth popping in for the classic sixth century architecture. Unlike in a lot of other mosques visitors can walk around the upper galleries, affording a good view of the whole building. Some unrestored areas are covered with plexiglas so you can see the what remains of the original design. Try to spot Justininan & Theodora's monogram on some of the carved column capitals.The courtyard is lovely and has a covered tea garden which is a good place to sit for an inexpensive early evening glass of tea.

The mosque retains the shape of the original Justinian church and there is an octagonal baptistery beside it, although the interior orientation has been changed a bit to align with the mihrab (the niche indicating the direction of Mecca) and the minbar (pulpit) where the iman delivers the Friday sermon. The interior is a total aesthetic delight, with every detail harmonising perfectly, and visitors are encouraged to go up to the gallery for more wonderful views and photo opportunities. Although there is no charge, a modest donation of a Lira or two to the mosque via its guardian would be appropriate.Dress code rules applying in smaller mosques. While the larger ones have more detailed information boards and issue plastic bags to carry your shoes around in, smaller mosques are more problematical. From my own observations 1) a woman trying to enter wearing a hat will be turned back \u2013 a shawl or scarf is expected 2) shoes should be taken off before standing on the carpet at the entrance to the mosque \u2013 I saw visitors told off for not doing this. They had reasonably assumed that they only needed to be shoeless once past the door and the prohibition is not made explicitly clear in the mosques with less tourist traffic 3) taking off your shoes and carrying them in your hands is frowned upon (while carrying them in the plastic bags provided in the larger mosques is fine)."

It is certainly less spectacular than the Hagia Sophia, but it has something to offer for people who are interested in older buildings. Do not expect original Byzantine architecture, however, as it has been heavily modified over the centuries, most recently to brace it against the vibrations from the railroad which runs right next to the building.For one thing, it is far less crowded, and you can take your time examining the paintings which decorate the upper galleries without feeling pushed or rushed. Although we did not have a language in common, the caretaker ensured that we saw all public parts of the building, by inviting us to climb to the gallery when we otherwise wouldn't have done so.As with all active mosques, you need to take off your shoes before entering, and women are asked to wear a headscarf.

This is one of the greatest treats that the city of Istanbul can offer...It's a quiet, loving, accepting place surrounded by coffee houses and artists' studios.

Maria Del Mar in Barcelona.\"Kacuk Ayasofya\" was the church of St. Sergius and Bacchus, the Patron Saints of the Military (the Orthodox tradition) for over 1000 years and it is still a place of pilgrimage for Christians, Sufis, poets, and secular humanists--straight and gay--as well as a fully functioning mosque. To accommodate the change from church to mosque, the orientation of the minbar and qibla were shifted off-axis and the altar removed, but this does nothing to detract from the sanctity--or balancing energy--of the place.I should also not that down the street (on a side street, 5 minutes away) is a masterpiece from the great Sinan: the Sokollu Mehmet Pasa Camii, making this a one-two punch of sacred architecture in what is my favorite city in the world: first Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque (5 minutes up the hill), then lunch (at \"Cesme\" down the street) and the aforementioned duo of Sokollu Mehmet and Kacuk Ayasoya...followed by \"chai\" in the garden next door. There's a day with a taste of Heaven...It's one of my favorite places in the world. True to Rumi's motto, it is a place to \"Come--whoever you are, Come!\". For any tour of Istanbul, it should be a \"must see\" (and don't forget there's an upstairs area which is perfect for reading and reflection). Enjoy--it still has a great deal to teach us...PS: One of the reviewers below mistakenly suggests that there is a cover charge--there is for the Great Hagia Sophia up the hill (now a museum), but not for this lovely shrine--it is still a place of worship. This little wonder was begun 5 years before its better known neighbor. John Romer pays homage to this \"Camii\" in his wonderful 4-part documentary, BYZANTIUM: THE LOST EMPIRE. Watching that excellent series (on dvd) would give you more than enough information with which to visit this site without a guide and enhance your appreciate of the city as a whole."

Just down the hill from the famous Hagia Sophia Mosque, near the shores of the Sea of Marmara, stands Istanbul's oldest surviving Byzantine monument. We literally stumbled upon Little Hagia Sophia at the end of a dead-end street, thought it was closed due to heavy drapings over its doors and were about to turn and leave the grounds when several people emerged from inside and around the door covering...so we entered. From its intricately-designed dome to the two-story marble colonnades, what an awesome sight! The mosque was entirely open to access, so we were able to climb the stairs to the galleries to fully appreciate the interior. We later found out from friends who live in Istanbul that Little Hagia Sophia is frequently not open to visitors, so we were indeed fortunate. A must see if possible."

This little jewel is hidden away, and takes some finding, but your efforts are well rewarded.Bult by Emperor Justinian before the Aya Sofia and dedicated to Saints Sergius and Bachus, it was converted to a mosque after the conquest. Recently renovated and recarpeted, the interior is stunning in its harmony and simplicity. Unlike the Aya Sofia which is dark inside, this is flooded by natural light. The garrulous old caretaker demanded baksheesh, but his performance made it worth the cost.We were the only visitors there and enjoyed the serenity which infused this sacred space."
