Distance from one gate to another is quite long."

We stopped at a small rest point down the hill from the greenhouse and had an ice-cream and iced tea in a pleasant creek side garden. We then slowly walked around to the French garden and then to the traditional Japanese garden, spending around two hours before turning down the path at the side of store in the Japanese garden to take us back to the Shinjuku entrance. It was an approximately 15 minute walk back to Shinkjuku train station, the trip back to Tokyo was 200 yen.Shinjuku has many restaurants and stores however it is very, very busy.

Try some green tea in one of the tea houses for a break from the heat or humidity, and try some of the ice cream too while your at it. A must do in the greater Tokyo area!"

There is also a very modern looking glass greenhouse. You may want to bring some bug repellent, as I was bitten by some kind of insect that set off an allergic reaction, resulting in multiple itchy hives. There were plenty of bathroom facilities throughout the park. There is a cafe at the entrance serving meals and drinks. The entrance fee was \u00a5200 per adult."

Went in from Shinjuku Gate of the Park somewhat late in the afternoon and it didn't take long to get to the English Tea Garden (really just a big spacious lawn) & the French Formal Garden (with beautiful multi-colored flowers, mostly roses); saw a big glass building too which probably is a conservatory or a greenhouse. Overall, it was a pleasure to walk through this park and was more or less impressed by the beautiful flowers at the French Garden, and yes there's a fairly big & peaceful lake too (maybe more than one, but I only saw one) in the Park.Shinjuku Station (a lot of train lines & Toei Shinjuku & Oedo Lines for subway) is just about a 10-minute walk away from Shinjuku Gate at the northwest of the Park; and if you're going to Meiji Jingu afterward (like I was), you might want to do like I did which is walk through the park from northwest to southeast (I guess like a diagonal way) and exit from Sendagaya Gate at the southeast of the Park, then get back onto the main road (outside Sendagaya Gate is just a small lane, so you'll have to first get back onto the main road parallel to that small lane) and turn right and just go straight on that road for about 10 minutes and you'll be at Yoyogi Park & at the north entrance gate of Meiji Jingu Shrine (the Shrine itself is another 5 to 10 minutes' walk from that gate)."

Shinjuku Gyoen Park is not a traditional \"play park\", but is, instead, a beautiful and peaceful oasis in the middle of crazy-busy Shinjuku. Balls, kites, bikes, skateboards, frisbees, rollerblades and pets are not allowed in order to foster a calm and serene environment. The park is split into 3 different areas--a Japanese garden, a French formal garden and an English garden. The Japanese garden my personal favorite, as it is a great place to have a picnic and enjoy the Japanese trees and landscape .  During the two short weeks of Sakura season (in March), the cherry blossoms in Shinjuku Gyoen are absolutely stunning. During this time, the park is insanely busy. My friends and I stood in line for 40 minutes just to get our admission tickets and enter the park. The lines are for a good reason: 1500 cherry trees in one park make it the perfect place for hanami, which is the traditional \"flower party\" picnic each family has under a cherry blossom tree during Sakura Season. I would not avoid Shinjuku during this time of year just because of the crowds-- the sheer volume of families having hanamis at the same time is part of the whole amazing sakura experience. It is such a huge part of Japanese culture, and its an image of Japan you will never forget. The canopies of cherry blossoms are absolutely breathtaking, so do not hessitate to go to Shinjuku Gyoen in March if you get the chance!!!The teahouse: My son and I went to the japanese tea house in June for some matcha. The atmosphere and overall experience was nice, but it was not a miniature tea ceremony, as I had expected. An elderly woman wearing a yukata simply escorted us into the old tea house room, sat us at our table, and brought us our matcha and sweets. No frills, no ceremonial movements, it was all very straight forward and simple, but still, it was nice to sip tea with my son in an old Japanese tea house. With all the walking you will do, it is nice to know there are vending machines and a snacks bar in the park. They even serve sakura ice cream at the snack bar in March. Knowing the hours of the park is important: We found out the hard way that the park closes its gates daily at 4:00 pm (much earlier than I expected a park to close) and it is closed all day every Monday. Also, there is an admission price of 200 yen per person."

The garden was quiet when we visited. There were not many people around. A few tourist and photographer taking advantage of the peaceful surroundings. There was one man eating his lunch in the garden. I can only compared this garden to St. James park in London. St. James park is more lively and has more birds and better for people watch. Each park has its good points but Gyoen National Garden is not for me. Gyoen national garden also charges a small entrance fee while St. James park is free.

Japanese gardens in US Smithsonian are much nicer than this (only reference I have)."

There is a small admission charge. But after you tour the park you will say that it was money well spent. There are basically 3 garden areas within the park. The English garden with its expansive lawns, the French garden with its beautiful symmetry and the Japanese garden with ponds and manicured trees. Spending an hour or so here will relax you before you hit the concrete sidewalks of Tokyo for the day."

We spent about 90 minutes in the Gardens - after our Guide picked us up at our Shinjuku hotel, we walked there. He gave us a great real-time lesson in the elements of a Japanese garden, and conjured for us how beautiful the park is in the spring, with the cherry blossoms in bloom. It was late July, so it was hot - but we found sufficient shade during our visit - and happily, it was a partly cloudy day. All in all, we found it a serene, calming, gloriously green oasis in a bustling, busy metropolis. I highly recommend visiting the gardens as part of a trip to Shinjuku."

While there is a lot of shade, and no expansive paved areas to radiate heat, if it's hot in the city it's going to be hot in the gardens even with a breeze. The park is very walkable, well-maintained and probably has more public restrooms than in all of Iceland. The roses in the French Garden were about the only thing in bloom and one cannot smell them because they are fenced off with a hedge around the entire perimeter. They were labeled with their names in English and Japanese. The trees that were labeled had their names in Japanese and Latin. There was also what appeared to be their Japanese name in English characters. I got to the greenhouse about 3:32 and learned that it closed at 3:30. It looks great from the outside and I was disappointed that I didn't know of its hours in advance. In my opinion you can spend as little as an hour in the garden or all day.Thanks for reading.If you found this useful I'll appreciate a helpful vote below."

After a week of site seeing and so many train stops, overwhelming flights of stairs and so much people, it is very nice to go for a walk at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. It was very relaxing and beautiful. entrance is only 200 yen . You can spend the whole day here if you want there lots to see or you can just lay on the grass and realax."

Its not the most well known place nor does it attract the most tourists, but its the most peaceful and calm place I have ever been to in my life and I don't think there is a place like it in the world. The park itself is beautiful it is like a completely natural environment, everything is seamless and every trail and plant seems perfectly placed. Highly recommend, don't miss out on this gem in the city."

The gardens have well marked paths that will take you through a number of differently themed gardens and past wide expanses of lawns. Some of the trees tower over the grounds, whilst other plants are small and well manicured. There are bursts of colour as well, and an interesting greenhouse. The onsite restaurant is nothing flash, but has basic and edible food, very friendly and attentive staff, scrupulously clean toilets, and welcomed air conditioning. There are some very lovely views in the park (including great contrasts between adjacent skyscrapers and the greener) and the atmosphere is relaxing. There are better gardens to visit in Japan - but I would highly recommend spending at least a couple of hours here. It is a large and expansive space, and it has a completely different feel because of its unique location. It is easily accessible by the rail system and then you can continue on foot from the park to some of the high class shops in the area (and spend a small fortune or just look). There is an entry fee but it is very reasonable and good value for money."

The Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden is a comfortable, and not overly strenuous, walking distance from the Shinjuku train station. The garden is not - entirely - what one would call a Japanese Garden. It does not - predominantly - feature miniature trees, or the eloquent detail one would expect to find in what is usually referred to as a Japanese Garden. However, it is a beautiful, and relaxing garden, suitable for a stroll along the various paths, walk on the bridge that takes you over a nice lake, or just take the opportunity to have a picnic in one of the many shady spots. The greenery, to all directions, is stunning and if you have children that enjoy playing with a ball, plenty of space to enjoy a kick of a ball in small or larger groups."

            "review": "Shinjuku Gyoen. Of all the parks and gardens in Tokyo, Shinjuku Gyoen evokes to me the most Central Park in Manhattan. It's not the size (it is less than one fifth of Central Park) but rather how the park is completely encased by the maddest section of the city yet feels peacefully detached from it. Minutes after you enter either through the Shinjuku or Okido gate, the wide and flat plane is laid out and you are instantly in a different world. Yet the juxtaposition of skyscrapers in the background, particularly that monstrosity NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building, is a reminder that the hustle and bustle is never too far away.As you pass through the vast French Formal Garden and English Landscape Garden, meander cross the duck ponds and delve deeper into the smaller and denser sections the park, the city starts to fade away. Looking out to the Japanese Garden from Taiwan Pavilion and sitting lazily watching the warm afternoon sun idle by, now I own this park all to myself. I visited in mid-Jan, three days after a rare snowstorm in Tokyo, and it looked and and felt like early fall when the pines are blue enough and the grass softly tanned.Shinjuku Gyoen was constructed on the site of a private mansion belonging to an Edo era feudal lord. It was first completed as an imperial garden in 1906 and then was opened to the public as a national garden after the Second World War.Y200 entrance fee (this less than $2 fee is in fact what keeps this park rather sparse, so please oblige), open everyday except Monday, best to enter and exit through either Okido or Shinjuku gates and walk the entire park. Shinjuku gate is 5min walk from Shinjuku Sanchome station, Okido gate is 10min walk from Shinjuku Gyoenmae Station."

There are so many different areas and it actually takes at least 1h30 to see everything (longer if you truly enjoy, stop sometimes and go slowly). I love the \"natural\" part as well as the elegant Japanese gardens. The greenhouse is worth it too. It is also perfect for picnics. I usually stop, and spend a day reading near the Japanese trees. Beware of the crows. They won't attack you, but do not play with them or let your kids chase them etc. They can defensively attack humans when they are nervous about nurturing."

Experience :-I marked this place as one of my must-visit during my trip in Tokyo for the Sakura Season and was not disappointed.I sat on one of these bench, watching the Sun slowly rise; people start coming. Most laid a mat on the grass and sat while chatting about their lives and sipping their tea , admiring the Cherry Blossoms. There were others doing Yoga.The scene with the Garden as a backdrop was very serene and relaxed.The Garden has a lot to offer in term of the varieties and very well maintained indeed.Advice :-1) Admission Fee (200 yen) is chargeable to enter but definitely worth it. Camera is fine but tripods should be avoided if possible (it is actually one of the prohibited item listed.2) There is no particular steep climb of any sort in the walk-through, so this attraction is definitely recommended for all3) Preferable time to visit? Personally, I was among the first to enter when it was less crowded. As the crowds start gathering steam when I left 2 hours later, the Garden (huge) was still plenty spacious for a good time. You can probably do this after some vigorous sight-seeing and just needed somewhere to get away from the buzz. Wayne\u2019s ratings (as ticked):-1) Must-GO!2) Recommended \u27143) Nay.. or best go as a fillerIn general, I would not put this as a deliberate must-go destination but more of somewhere that should be weaved in after a vigorous itinerary. It is recommended for all who are into greenery/flowers/nature or for people who are seeking a breather from the buzz."

This traditional garden managed by the Japanese emperor's office is a very peaceful place, not only for the Sakura season in April, but any season.Even though they will charge you some fees to enter, it's worse paying for. Also, please be aware that no alcohol is sold inside the park. However, you could bring some if you like, but this is not a place to get drunk.Japanese gardens, rose gardens, and you'll enjoy the park if you want to touch the heart of Japanese culture. Enjoy!"

A short walk from Shinjuku Station -- we decided to go on a nice sunny day after having a particularly difficult time finding a breakfast spot recommended by one of my favourite magazines (Monocle) called Mimet. The park was definitely a nice way to destress after being lead astray by Google twice. The park was lovely and full of people out with their families, or couples strolling through the many gardens and fields. Plenty of tourists also, but lost of locals it seemed as well. Unfortunately we just missed the cherry blossoms which seemed like they would have provided a magnificent sight. As it is, they were all littering the ground beneath the trees. But this did not take away from the peaceful and lovely atmosphere. Highly recommend taking some lunch and eating it at the park, and then topping it off with an ice cream cone from one of the vendors in the park as you stroll around. Lots of opportunities for photographers, so pack your camera if you're into that. It was a nice break from the walks around the other parts of Tokyo. The price of entrance was minimal, and totally worth it."

            "review": "Green oasis amidst the concrete and bright lights of Shinjuku. Shinjuku Gyoen, a park on lands fomerly belonging to the feudal Naito family, is one of the few parks in Tokyo to charge an entrance fee (200 yen or a little lesss than 2USD at current rates per person) which discourages \"non-serious\" visitors. There are also strict about not allowing dogs (sorry, dog walkers !) and no alcohol (they have recently started checking bags and confiscating alcoholic beverages found during the peak sakura / cherry blossom season). All these rules mean that the park is great for families and kids who have not yet learned or fallen for the other brighter charms of Shinjuku. In other words, it is great for those want some \"clean\" and \"peaceful\" fun. For those who want to hold a beer while on the grass or are seekig to enjoy the company of cannine friends, Elvis Presley lookalikes and daredevil skateboarders, the bigger and more lively Yoyogi Park to the west is a better option. For nearby residents the annual pass (sold only at the park's Shinjuku gate for 2,000 yen) is a good bargain if you intend to make more than 10 trips in a year. Note that the annual pass (or \"passport\" as it is called in Japanese) is not sold for a month in spring (March 25 to April 24) and two weeks in autumn (November 1 to 15) possibly to discourage out of towners to \"game\" the system during peak times of the year in the park's calendar (more on that is below). The park is dividend into sections, including some nicely laid out French, English and Japanese gardens and also has a large park in the center with some magnificent trees at its edges, including some cherry blossoms. On summer weekends, areas of the park that gets some shade are highly sought after for picnics while winters see people finding spots on the sunnier parts. The park also has a greenhouse (recently renovated and improved) where they grow tropical plants (perhaps the only place in Tokyo to see bananas and papayas growing on trees and not on supermarket shelves) and patches of flowering plants that vary from season to season (the pamphlet at the entrance or when you buy tickets shows which flowers are in bloom during which month). The park really is at its most crowded during the spring cherry blossom viewing season but the policy of not allowing alcohol, barbecue sets, karaoke systems and not allowing prior staking of prime viewing spots means sober and less raucous crowds. Many photographers and tourists choose to come here as a result. Autumns and winters are a good time for seeing (and photographing) migratory birds (e.g. Siberian ducks, etc) who make a brief stop here to experience Tokyo city life on their way further down south. The bird numbers vary from year to year and in lean years one may have to hang around the watering areas for quite a while to spot the rarer visitors. The park has several toilets and good signage (in both English and Japanese) and also one or two places selling candy, ice creams and soft drinks. Vending machines for canned coffee, tea, etc are also situated at easy to find locations. There are designated smoking areas (close to the toilets). Since the park closes at 17 pm, the stategically placed speakers all over the park start announcing the closing time and playing BGM or Auld Lang Syne from 16:30 onwards (the greenhouse does not allow visitors to come in after 15:30) and soon after the music starts, park guards wearing green jackets come out (not sure where they hide all day) riding bicycles to start exhorting kids, lovey dovey couples and stragglers out of the park ! On summer days when the sun is still out, one wishes the guards would let people be or that the park management decided to keep it open for a bit longer... but this being Japan rules need to be followed... and as one steps back out into Shinjuku, Yotsuya or Sendagaya (depending on which gate one comes out of) one feels more thankful and amazed that this oasis has survived in the midst of all the concrete and glass that is all around."

The garden was very big and there were many opportunities where you could have a great photoshoot: on the big field, on benches and even smack right in the middle of nowhere.

Follow the path to the Taiwan pavilion. Nice photo op. Follow the path and cover the park in an anti clockwise manner. The is the French styled garden with lots of roses, and english portion, a nice greenhouse with plants like papaya and banana. Make sure you at aside some time to check out one of the houses.

I had heard great things about Gyoen National Garden and I wasn't disappointed and it beat other national gardens id seen in Asia and Europe hands down. So many picture perfect views in the garden itself and the some very exotic plants such as banana trees and coffee plants. It's easy to forget you are in one of the worlds most exciting and futuristic cities and it's so serene that I'm sure I would visit every week if I could. It would be a true pity not to come here in Tokyo."

This was the first real park / garden we visited and we were amazed.After spending half a day walking around, looking at the trees and flowers and everything, we bought a bento box and sat down to enjoy the scenery.We then decided to come back later that week with hopefully more trees blooming.And we were right. This time, way better prepared with food and drinks, we sat down in one of the grass areas and just enjoyed the sunny day with thousands of other people; it never felt overcrowded and the atmosphere was fantastic.When we walked around, we took plenty of pictures with the cherry trees as all the others are doing. Everyone seems very happy and it was just a joy being there and spend the day with all the people enjoying themselves.We stayed until the park closes and it was the best day we had in Tokyo."

On a beautiful sunny afternoon at the start of Golden Week we went to explore the nearby Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden.Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden was constructed on the site of a private mansion belonging to Lord Naito, a feudal lord of the Edo era. It was completed in 1906 as an imperial garden, and re-designated as a national garden after World War II and made open to the public. The gardens are 144 acres in size and blend three different styles: English Landscape Garden, French Formal Garden, and Japanese Traditional Garden. It is considered to be one of the most important gardens from Japan\u2019s Meiji era.The garden has three aspects: English, French, and Japanese all with the own characters.The English gardens included some nice wooded areas that were shady and restful and it was very pleasant to just amble along amidst the Golden Week revellers who had also decided to enjoy the gardens.The French Gardens \u2013 manicured and ordered, included the plains trees that now look more like pines.The Japanese garden \u2013 at least during our visit \u2013 didn\u2019t have many flowers in bloom and the trees, bushes, and plants were more sculpted, though not into specific shapes or figures like a topiary. There were also more stone features here than we found in the English and French gardens on the western side.The National Garden also has a large greenhouse whose history dates back to 1875. It has been built, razed, redesigned, and reconstructed numerous times during the years and is now an environmentally conscious greenhouse dedicated to the conservation and exhibition of endangered species. Inside there a many wonderful and exotic plants, trees, and flowers and the greenhouse has been designed so there is a winding path that takes you past and through everything there is to see.Entry to the gardens is only \u00a5200 so there\u2019s definitely no excuse for anyone not to enjoy the wonderful grounds and landscapes of the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden when in Tokyo. We definitely recommend it."

I've visited this garden in all five seasons (yes, they have five - the fifth is 'rainy season, from early June to mid-July, if you're not familiar with Japan), and I have to say my favorite times are mid-spring, after sakura, when the cherry blossoms bring out the masses, and autumn. In May, 2016, the rose garden was to die for, but I'm a gardener, and in October 2015, the sycamore avenue was a wonder. It's very close to other must-sees, too, so if you're a first-time Japan visitor, make it a point to get off JR's Yamanote Line at the nearby Yoyogi Station (not Shinjuku, you'll only get lost there), and take a day for a decent walkabout. One stop the other way is Harajuku Station, where you can't get lost on your way to Meiji Jingu Shrine, another must-see, although this year a lot of it was shrouded in construction/renovation curtains. Nonetheless, if you visit either of those places on a Saturday or Sunday chances are you'll see brides and grooms being photographed in their traditional finery, and you can join in the fun."

There were many picnickers. Everyone was out to enjoy the nice spring weather.There are a few attractions in the National Garden not to be missed...the Greenhouse, Taiwan Pavilion, Old Imperial Rest House (only open on certain days of the week) and Tea House where you can enjoy delicious ocha and sweet. Its French garden is tastefully manicured and has many species of beautiful roses with vivid colours and celebrated names, like Mozart, Princess Aiko, Princess Anne, etc. The fragrance of the bloom permeated the air. I felt really happy to be there, even though it was filled with visitors. It's indeed worth a visit if time permits but allows at least 3-4 hours for exploring the exquisite Garden.

It's also great because alcoholic drinks are not allowed so you won't be subject to the drunken revelry at some of the other sakura spotting sights. Even without sakura, it's a lovely place and has a glass conservatory for tropical plants.

The cost is minimal, 200 Yen or just a little under $2.00 per person. The park has several entrances, we arrived at the Shinjuku gate where their is a visitor center;you can purchase seeds and plants at very reasonable prices. Once inside the gate you will find a snack shack and restrooms located on your left. If you order food, you will be called back up to the counter when your order is ready. We had the ice milk at the snack shack near the Shinjuko entrance; it was pretty disappointing in taste and texture compared to other frozen treats we've had so far in Japan. A sign near the entrance recommends using bug spray, which is probably best, since their are several areas with water. The park has traditional tea houses and at least one green house. Many families and couples come to the park to picnic and relax in the sunshine. Wear comfortable shoes for lots of walking on sidewalks and trails. The park is located approximately 10 minutes from the Shinjuko train station by foot. From the south exit of Shinjuku, cross the street, turn left and walk down the hill until you run into the Shinjuku gate on your right. Numerous restaurants, shops and movie theatres in the area. Keep in mind that bicyclists may be using the sidewalks and ride within the pedestrian traffic; they ride very fast!"

Everywhere is picture perfect. :) Please allow at least 2 hours to fully explore the area.Overall, I think this place should be included in everybody's list of places to go to in Tokyo especially for first-timers.

The park was busy because of the blossom tree's being in bloom, but was still a beautiful park and not so crowded you couldn't enjoy it. It was calm yet had an atmosphere! We had matcha green tea and Japanese cake in one of the 'tea rooms' for 700 yen each. Which was an experience worth exploring. You're served by Japanese women in traditional dress; find the tea room which isn't open and next to a souvenir shop, it is the one which you go through a closed door and doesn't quite look open!"

The ladies were delighted to show a visitor around and kindly presented me with a botanic print to commemorate the occasion. I enjoyed the green quietness of Shinjuku Gyoen and felt revived by my stroll along the paths. One interesting section had bald cypress air roots protruding from the ground like pinnacles. It was a strange and somewhat bizarre sight. Be aware that Shinjuku Gyoen like some other parks, is occasionally closed when Tokyo is threatened by dengue fever. The shade and moist soil apparently harbour mosquitoes although I didn't see any at all on my visit. The park is easily accessible by public transport with the Shinjuku Gyoen subway station close by."

This was because we'd just visited Kenroku-en Garden in Kanazawa, one of the top 3 most beautiful gardens in Japan. Scepticism unfounded! Shinjuku Gyoen is beautiful in its own right, more botanically varied than a pure traditional Japanese garden. It has sycamore trees, an English garden and a French formal garden as well. Admittedly, we were wild about the cherry blossoms that were still present during our visit. Our 5 yo had a wonderful time running around the garden and posing for shots in so many picturesque locations. I think it's wonderful that Shinjuku has an admirable sized green lungs that provides for a diversion from the hustle hustle of the cityscape."

(14th April 2016) Not as many Somei Yoshino but enough to take photos with. Parents came here during the peak season last year and were captivated by myriads of blooming cherry blossoms. Costs 200 yen per entry."

The Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden does not disappoint (please note though, admission is not free, it costs 200 Yen/$1.85 USD per person). There are many places within the gardens where you can go to sit and relax and take in the cherry blossoms and pure nature all around you. There are so many nice views of the city (and their skyscrapers) all around you too, as well as little ponds, great open lawn, a greenhouse, and even a bit of forestry. It's a break from the city life and a wonderful reminder of the outdoors and how therapeutic and beautiful they can be. You've also got to appreciate the many people out and about socializing and enjoying each other's company. All in all, this is a must-do in Tokyo and highly recommended!"

More on that later.Getting to Shinjuku Gyoen is easy. There are 3 different stations via different lines near the park. I would suggest taking the Marunouchi line (I hope the spelling is correct) and alight at Shinjukugyoen Mae station. The park is just a couple minutes walk from the station. Adults have to pay 200Y for entry while kids below certain age get free entry. Once in, you will get to enjoy the vast grounds and serenity. Despite the huge crowd, we still get to find a spot for a picnic, and do what the locals do, enjoy the scenery and food. On the other hand, Ueno park is free for entry and they have pathways lined with endless Sakura. However, I find it less conducive for sit downs, and you don't get that sense of peace and serenity that you will get at Shinjuku Gyoen. And that's why Shinjuku Gyoen is tops in my mind."

A small shop near the entrance sells bento boxes, ice cream and drinks at very reasonable prices. There are a few sit-down restaurants further in the park.

Despite us only catching the tail end of the Blossoming season (in Tokyo atleast) many of the trees were still beautiful and not a barren wasteland as I had always dreaded! I can only imagine how beautiful the blossoms are during it's peak - for Tokyo, I believe it was literally the last week of March to the first week of April; we visited on the 7th of April.We somehow managed to spend 4 hours taking a very slow walk around the park (just the once), it was such a nice sunny day and the park itself were so beautiful I just did not want to leave (and I'm a guy!)"

It's relatively easy to get to from the nearby Tokyo Metro station exit about 350metres away, not too far off from heart of Shinjuku. Entrance fees was \u00a5200, and the guards at the gate search your bags. Noticed they don't allow tripods or large bulky camera bags/gears, so local photographers get around that by packing light, and using foldable camera gear (eg extendable monopods) in small wheeled bags. Do look at the main map near gate, and use that to plan your route. If the front grounds (where many cherry/plum blossoms trees are located), are too crowded for example, use the map to see which paths head to the lake or other areas. Signs are prominently placed, and at least bilingual (Japanese + English), though a few signs here & there have Korean and Mandarin.Do line up in the Q at popular scenic spots to take photos/selfies, and move on after taking a few shots. Some of the local elderly photographers are rather vocal & will buzz you off if you take too many shots, and make them wait long in the Q behind you. Trash bins are only located near main entrance/near the tea houses (quaint lil Japanese tea shops selling curios, snacks & beverages), and the locals don't take kindly to litterbugs.The tea houses are worth a detour off the main routes, as they've seats (only for customers who buy their stuff) to rest, and the main toilets are generally a short distance away.Many scenic spots, and the occasional large grass patch to rest & people watch. The locals dressed in their Spring best, to mingle around and take selfies/wefies, and consume meals/snacks in groups. Very safe locale as regular park rangers patrols make their comforting presence felt. They're also the ones who go after Q jumpers & litterbugs...Worth spending a few hours there, even if only to soak up fresh sun, breathe in fresh air, and admire the many scenic spots. Do avoid weekends due to the crowds, and put on a pair of good comfy walking shoes.. Enjoy =) !"

Recommended for early morning or after 2pm. This garden is big, including a greenhouse with exotic species, and has several doors, so take your precautions and don't get lost. It will be closed at 4:30pm."

Those that were in bloom, were stunning and everyone was taking pictures by the lovely trees.This garden is interesting because it has several different styles in one place. A Japanese garden with scenic bridge and pagoda as well as a very neat French garden as well. Interesting to compare the styles.There was a nice lawn by the Japanese garden where we sat and had a rice cake snack - was very relaxing and great for people watching! Our family had members from age 4 - 64 and we all enjoyed it.Beware that the park closes early - 4:30 pm - so try to plan this excursion on the early side of the day."

The garden is just wonderful and must be seen. Cannot describe it in words. There are some small coffee shops in the park and plenty of restroom facilities.We came early and stayed for 3-4 hours. Then it was really filling up with people.Later we saw advertisement for guided tour to the park at Yen 12,000 This seems not necessary at all since it is very easy to go there and once there you just want to walk around in your own pace.

The entrance costs 200yen and tickets can be purchased easily from the gate at the entrance. Queues are long but they move relatively fast. There were trees of all colours of Sakura and we managed to snap very good photos there. Many local Japanese, young and old, were there for picnics on the grounds. It was the same at Ueno park but the atmosphere at Shinjuku Gyoen felt more alive maybe because of the beautiful scenery of the Sakura all around us.The Gyoen is only a short walk from the shinjuku station. If you are at takashimaya, you are then very close so just keep walking onwards and ask anyone for directions as it is very easy to find.My husband has a sensitive nose and despite the beauty of the place, we could only stay for no more than 20mins before the pollens irritates his eyes and nose.I am not sure of how the place would look during other seasons of the year but during spring, it is not to be missed :-)"

The cherry blossom season was about to begin - one tree had already blossomed, and we encountered a number of people taking pictures of this one tree. There is, of course, a traditional Japanese garden, small lakes, bridges, paths, etc. We passed a couple of little teahouses where one could get a snack. Very enjoyable way to escape the bustle of the city for a bit."

The park is beautiful. Once you've papped the blossoms, do yourself a favour and wander off to the furthest corners. There you can enjoy some peace and quiet as well as a more interesting, varied scenery, a world away from the blossom tourist hordes."

We arrived half an hour before closing and the strict guards at the gate would not let us in even though we said we would pay and just look at the sakura that were visible just inside of the gate.

It's worth stopping by if you'd have the spare time and energy, and just want to \"hang around\". But would perhaps be a must-see in spring where it should be at its best. It's a little walk off the subway exit, but not hard to find as you only have to look for the densed trees as your guide. If you see the trees, then head towards that direction and find the nearest entrance which is located at each end of the block. We proceeded to the heart of Shinjuku after, which was a couple of blocks away. If your feet won't let you walk anymore, you might be better off taking a short subway ride instead. Either way, it's doable."

This garden is beautiful and this beauty is planned for all seasons.Excellent casual atmosphere. Many walking/strolling trails, just enough historic buildings and an oasis in the middle of the skyscrapers. The rest of the world seems to go away in the peace and beauty. Saw many people spread blankets for family picnics, photographers catch the beauty of the foliage and colors of the season and displays educating the public about the history and goals of the garden.Would recommend making time for a two hour visit which may become three or even four hours, depending on the season.

Eventually we went to the traditional Japanese garden and it was one of the most beautiful places we visited in Tokyo. It was picture perfect.

When she stood on the bridge, I pushed record on my camera and walked towards her and after a short story about how much I loved her and how lucky we were, I proposed. She said yes!

Boy, was I wrong! After paying the nominal entrance fee (which is thoroughly worth it), we were greeted with the most beautiful garden ever. The further you walk, the nicer it gets. We especially enjoyed the Japanese garden. It was wow at every corner. So serene and calm. The lakes were so beautifully calm that it made for great photos. I can only imagine how beautiful this place would be during sakura season as well as autumn. If you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a while, this is a great choice.

Unusually it also has an English and a French formal garden. Don't expect a recreation of Versailles - this is just a few lines of deciduous trees and a small hedge with surrounding grey gravel but it's a nice contrast. Numerous tea houses are located in the park although most were closed when we visited in December. Large open lawns must be nice in summer but looked very brown and dry in winter. Mostly flat, easy grade walking and 5 minutes from several subway stations. Highlight for me was sitting in winter sunshine by the Middle Pond eating croissants and drinking a takeaway coffee and forgetting I'm in one of the busiest cities in the world."

The Gyoen offers many sights, such as small lakes with turtles, thousands of trees, an English garden and many more attractions. I'm sure Shinjuku Gyoen will also attract many visitors during the 2020 Olympics. There is only one thing that I do not like.... The park is closed on Mondays and even the outer way -which is actually outside the park area - is closed. This is very 'provincial' in my eyes and unworthy of a modern tourist friendly city.

The walk is pleasant almost jungle like; with verdant greenery all around. Early mornings make for a great outing, as was in my case."

Tokyo wakes late!There is a small admission fee of a few dollars, but it's a lovely garden and well worth it.Unfortunately there were no maps in English, but as usual, I found a very helpful Japanese man who gave me an overview. He ran the cafe in the middle of the park. I wasn't even a customer, and he still gladly helped me.The garden isn't too big, and I walked around and saw everything in about an hour. The greenhouse wasn't very interesting at all, but the Japanese gardens with all the maple tree leaves in red were beautiful. All against a backdrop of the Tokyo city skyline."

I wasn't sure what to expect and I was afraid that their wouldn't be any cherry blossoms. This was not the case. I have never seen anything like this garden. It was beautiful, everything was planned perfectly. I am not normally a person that enjoys looking at a garden for multiple hours, but this was different. The garden was so peaceful and I left feeling like I was able to see one of the most attractive aspects of Japanese culture. I recommend this to anyone especially during cherry blossom season."

In a city jamb packed with buildings it is a very pleasant green space. Nothing outstanding except in certain seasons. The Cherry Blossoms in April are excellent, not the best in the city but very, very good. The chrysanthemum exhibit in October is stunning, Check the calendar for the dates it normally lasts about 2 weeks. The fall leaves come late in the year as Tokyo is a warm micro-climate due to all the buildings and people so you can see momiji there much later than in the outskirts of the city.Other than these three things there is little that I would go out of my way to see unless you are looking for green grass, trees, flowers, and a degree of quiet in a city that is sorely lacking in all four."

And a further bizarre twist to the climate meant that on 11th December 2015 it was a glorious afternoon with a cloud-free sky driving the temperature up to 22 C. So we had the colours and scents of autumn, but the feel of a summer's day.The Japanese love their autumn leaves, and they were all photographing them; initially to our bemusement, but we just had to join in and take snaps of the reds, oranges and yellows against the blue sky. To an Englishman, paying to enter a public park seems strange, but 200 yen was worth the experience.BTW the 'rest area' next to the Shinjuku Gate serves amazing vanilla soft ice cream cones"

It was such nice weather when we were there that I really do not want to get out of this park/garden after 3 hours. Though there is a small fees of 200Yen for each entry.I think it is worth. Remember to ask the Ranger at the Entrance for the English version mapNext we walk and saw the green house which at that time house a variety of specialty orchids and tropical plants ( which is common for me as Singaporean ) but special for the local and Japanese. There was a large banana plant in that green house with a special type of Banana with red skin. The local Japanese was amazed by this as I just walked by. So was the Hibiscus Plant and flower which is common in Singapore and Malaysia. The best park was the park. I love the yellow leaves and the trees. The families with children, the youngsters with their friend, an Indonesia family with the girl in Kimono ( dressed up for the Photo shoots ) were a few of the noticeable crowd around me. We found an empty place, like the locals, sat down and enjoy the sun ( warm and the cool late Autumn breeze). The Air as so fresh that I felt so refreshed and my mind cleared completely after a few very conscious breathing in and exhaling out exercises. Love the part that everyone mind their own business and speak softly- unlike the crude and loud audience shouting around the field. ( except for one occasion where a C national shouted across the field for her daughter and grandson) The pansy flowers which is common in Japan was my favorite. I took many pictures of these.Further round the other side of the garden is a pond where the ducks are swimming leisurely,waiting to be fed by the strangers. The tea place is so crowded that we decided to give this place a miss. I will definitely like to come again in late Spring or Autumn once more."

I exited using Exit 2 - when I came out the exit, I turned left and crossed over to the other side of the road! After walking left for about 5 minutes, it was on the right!

On this trip to Japan we visited many gardens; so much so that I can't remember what I saw in each garden. I just remember thinking, for future long-term stay, it won't be Hong Kong anymore, but Japan Tokyu Stay Shinjuku for daily walks in Shinjuku Gyoen, AND Lake Villa Kawaguchiko for walks around Lake Kawaguchiko."

There is even a little typical japanese house, where you can buy a ticket outside and visit it. The price in cludes a green tea or macha tea, and a mochi cake home made.The lady was very pleasant to talk to and friendly. The park is huge and you need at least a good couple of hours to see its main things, as ponds, little bridges, the ying yang, etc... Take one afternoon before dinner time, you will enjoy itThis park is in the centre of the city and one of the most well known parks in the area. It is surrounded by restaurants outside the park and caffee places. So no need to bring your own, unless you want it. Must visit it!I hope this helpedDanXX"

They prepared wheel chair, anybody can use it free inside park. There is a votanical garden for tropical plants, Japanese garden, European garden, and big beautiful lake. Walk along the path, sit, lie down - enjoyed like in heaven."

If you do not feel like walking, you can always just sit down wherever; there are benches if you don't like sitting on the grass and if there are a few vending machines and a store in case you get thirsty or hungry.I would recommend visiting during the spring because there are a lot of cherry blossoms at around this time. Definitely bring a camera, especially if you like to take a lot of pictures. If you wish, you can also picnic inside although I've never tried it. If you are coming from Shibuya, you can easily walk to this area. We didn't take up much time in the area though, just an hour probably but it was nonetheless a worth-it visit."

As I visited the park in early autumn, the entire garden was transformed from a sea of green to a riot of autumn colours!

It's a very large park with multiple ponds and traditional tea houses, with backdrops of city buildings. Many koi and carp inhabit the ponds. The park has extensive \"free\" area where groups of school children meet during the day for field day activities. This was one of my favorite parts -- watching the children in their coordinating hats participate in games. There are refreshment areas and sufficient bathrooms. It's a very nice way to spend the day, and I didn't even get to cover the majority of it!"

Many lovely walking paths and views and seat, all no doubt changing with the seasons. We went in summer, when everything was green, but there were less flowers than you will find in Spring. It's a nice garden, but not in the same league as the gardens in Kyoto, so if you've been to Kyoto, maybe think twice about this one. This is often described as one of Tokyo's best gardens.The Garden has a very good new greenhouse that is certainly worth including in your visit.The best way to get there is on the Marounuchi Subway line, even though it's a couple of stops from Shinjuku station and is walkable if you wish. There are some small snack bars and some traditional tea houses in the garden. We partook of a traditional tea and sweet, which was quite expensive, but nice nonetheless. Not a tea ceremony, just fresh tea and a jelly sweet, nicely served in the tea house. (see the photo)There's a small entry fee.Worth a visit if you're in the area."

I believe it\u2019s too hot and humid to walk in summer months. Lots of trees, gardens, and ponds. A little green house was interesting too. Wear comfortable shoes. You will walk a lot. From JR Shinjuku station south or east exit, walk along the big street (Kosyu kaido) to east. In ten minutes or so, you see the park entrance on your right. Or you can take Tokyo metro Marunouchi line, and get off at Shinjuku gyoen station which is in front of the park. Admission was 200 yen. Soft serve ice cream at the little shop in the park was good!"

Having done quite a few of the sights on previous occasions, I resorted to good old TripAdvisor to see what they recommended in their top ten list of things to see and do. Number one was the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, and as I planned to have lunch in Shinjuku I decided to make a trip to these gardens.And am I glad I did. The Gyoen National Garden is simply magnificent, and huge (although it is quite feasible to explore the whole park if you have time). I entered at the north-east corner of the park, about ten minutes walk from Shinjuku Station. The entrance fee is 200 Yen, a little under US$2. My circuit on this particular day took me first to the western part of the park, and the expansive Japanese gardens. Then I skirted the southern edge all the way to the French gardens on the east side, then walked through the English gardens to exit from the same place.I spent about two hours in Gyoen, but you could easily take half a day or more to explore. What I liked most about these gardens, and this was quite a busy Saturday afternoon, was how easy it was to find solitude. I also loved the Japanese gardens and their picturesque lakes, islands and bridges.So, if you are anywhere close to Shinjuku, don't miss out on this horticultural wonderland. And if you're a bit concerned about finding the place, get a taxi. Everyone in Tokyo knows the Gyoen National Garden!"

It's large and compromises of a number of different areas including an 'english landscape garden' and 'japanese traditional garden', both of which we particularly enjoyed strolling through. We also enjoyed having having a drink at the tea house which was very relaxing. There are a number of places to get snacks and drinks (including a restaurant by the entrance where we actually had breakfast) and a very adequate number of toilets throughout the park, too. At only a couple of hundred yen this park we thought was extremely good value and I can't imagine that anyone would not enjoy their visit! It's a very refreshing contrast to the busy hubbub of central Tokyo and a very beautiful park in its own right, so I would definitely recommend it."

In autumn, the colors of the red maples trees are magnificent and in spring all lovers come for a cherry blossom photo. the show is on trees and on ground with petals covering acres of grass. In summer, the cicada song is so impressive that it's deafening and recovering even from the park's entrance the noise of the city. Two small advices : 1) To enjoy even more this beautiful park, you can come with a picnic. Small shops are selling tea, coffee and few sweets. For main course, don't forget to stop before at level -1 of ISETAN (in Shinjuku- 5 min from the park), where the best take-away food is sold. 2) Going out by the sendagaya door will allow you to easily reach by foot the Meiji Temple, then move on for a walk in Harajuku and Omotesando."

It was breathtaking to see line upon line of pink trees with lots of happy families picnicking under them! The Japanese sure do love their gardens!

The early closing hours are a real bummer, since if you work in Tokyo it is impossible to visit after the workday. Finally, the gates all close before 1630, except the main gate.

We enjoyed leisurely strolling the gardens and many large lawn areas surrounded by lush green trees. There were a few tea houses and a restaurant, but we didn't go inside these. We, also, visited a greenhouse with many tropical plants and a small waterfall and formal French style gardens with rose bushes and sycamores.We probably spent a couple hours exploring the gardens. There weren't many people there when we visited, so we enjoyed a peaceful morning walk. It was a wonderful respite from the busy city. I loved seeing all the beautiful greenery in the middle of crowded Shinjuku!"

Peace and tranquil in the city, accesible easily from the nearest train station. About 5 to 10-minute walk. It\u2019s a good place for families with children where kids can run freely. I went on a Friday morning, hardly anyone there. There were groups of children (from some kindergartens probably) with their families enjoying the space. You may watch some old Japanese men trying out their hands at painting the scenery. There are cafes in the park and a small cottage to experience the Japanese way of tea-drinking \u2013 for a price,700 Yen. Be prepared to walk if you are going for the greens. A pair of comfortable shoes is a must."

In certain areas the mosquitoes were unbearable so if you are a person susceptible to being bitten take insect repellant.The pond with Koi carp and terrapins was very scenic and looked traditionally Japanese.There is also an Old Imperial Rest house that is open to the public and one can walk through it to see around four rooms that used to be used by the imperial family in 1896. Couple of tea houses, rest houses where one can buy snacks and a restaurant are in the garden.Many restrooms interspersed all round the place. Coin lockers available.

If you're looking for a picnic destination with a relaxing atmosphere, beautiful surroundings, and in a central location - Shinjuku Park is the place for you. Although there are opening times and a small entry fee, the park is immaculately kept, and offers plenty of opportunities to explore the gardens or enjoy a picnic lunch in one of the green spaces. I do believe there are a few cafes and tea houses; however I didn't have the opportunity to visit due to buying a bento from the conbini beforehand. Although it was very crowded when I visited (late March-April during cherry blossom season), it does not distract from the natural beauty the park has to offer."

It is one spot in the Shinjuku area that you can count on for being clean, fairly quiet (except maybe during cherry blossom season), and full of greenery. If you're looking for a park to play, run, and drink in, this is not the park for you. For that, you're more likely to be happy with Yoyogi Park. Shinjuku Gyoen is a great place for a quiet picnic, a pleasant stroll, or a place to take a rest. If you are there during a busy time, you're best not to use the main gate if possible. It is the Shinjuku Gate that can get backed up as people are buying their entrance tickets."

As we were staying less than 500m away from this large expanse of green it seemed a shame not to go an have a look and to contrast with something like the Palace gardens. The Y200 entrance fee was a little unexpected (I hadn't done any research), but it is pretty nominal. There are some interesting restrictions/warning signs - no kites, no sports, but these are appropriate as it is a relaxing and peaceful place - not a sports field.The gardens have a good variety of trees, plants and areas. The greenhouse is quite a modern design, but very attractively laid out with interesting specimens (I was interested to see the pitcher plants and the banana palms had a lot of bananas).Elsewhere, examples of shaped bushes, ponds, a Japanese garden and expanses of grass let me explore different sections and appreciate the overall feeling of space that is present. However, the fact that you are in the middle of a city of 12 million people provides reminders including the sound of trains and the skyscrapers that appear in the pond reflections.On the cloudy day I went, it was nice, relaxing and enjoyable. On a sunny day, other than being hot, I expect the blue sky and bright greens would make it even better."

My personal favourite was the Japanese garden with its neatly manicured shrubs and bonsais. Definitely worth a visit!"

Japanese rock garden are perfectly combed , combining colour and texture in a way never seen anywhere else. On one pathway you will see a bamboo water feature. It is quite small and you could easily pass it by mistake. Lean down and gather a small container of water from the flow. When you pour it down the hole and bend to listen, a musical waterfall can be heard as it trickles down into the earth. So lovely!"

But the park is so large & the Japanese folk so disciplined & discreet, that it really didn't matter. The park has various gardens in different styles.

The cherry blossom was falling from the trees, making you feel like you were being showered in confetti. It created a carpet of pink. So very special. The park would be beautiful outside of cherry blossom season too with the many trees, bridges and grassy areas. We visited on a Sunday afternoon so it was busy with families having picnics under the trees. Such a great atmosphere. There is a small fee of 200 yen to enter the park and this includes access to the amazing conservatory with the many varieties of plants and flowers."

We would suggest going a bit later than mid-March as the cherry blossoms were not fully blossomed yet- only saw a dozen of them blossomed. Overall quite a nice stroll, they have cherry blossom featured food items (mostly sweet) that you can buy. Super nice and good cleaniness. Check out our vlog documentation about it!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdkT1N4sWP0"

It is pretty big so takes a bit of time to walk through & see all the different mini gardens inside but it is worth it. I was also pleasantly surprised with the no of people having a picnic/get together there as well as no of artists making paintings of flowers."

While the gardens cover a large area, we only spent time in the Japanese gardens and were completely satisfied. As we were there in the first week of April, the gardens were teeming with cherry blossoms, as well as budding maple trees and a wide variety of other beautifully manicured shrubs and trees. There are a couple of ponds to wander around, with bridges crossing the water. There is also a temple in the grounds that make a wonderful photo opp. It was lovely to see so many families out enjoying the gardens and having a picnic under the trees. There were plenty of places to buy food or drinks to enjoy while you roam the grounds. We spent a couple of hours just in the Japanese part of the garden and I'm sure the other areas are equally as beautiful. If you have the time to spare, I would recommend you take the time to enjoy a stroll around the whole garden. It would probably take most of the morning or afternoon at least if you want to take in the whole garden."

I went to Shinjuku by JR Yanamote Line and changed to Chuo-Sobu Line on the other side of the same platform to Sendagaya. Sendagaya station has only one exit. When you exit, turn right immediately and then turn right again to go under the railway bridge. Keep going along the iron fence of Shinjuku Gyoen. Soon you will come to Sendagaya Gate. I arrived there at 9:30am and there was no queue at the ticketing counter, although cherry blossoms were still in full bloom. Admission fee was 200yen per adult. There was a security check counter. Free maps in Japanese were available inside the garden and maps in English were available from the ticketing office. The English one has more precise information for visitors including the historical background of the garden. I found this garden very friendly and enjoyable, because we could go right close to the cherry blossom trees to take photos. I walked along the pond and took many photos. I was able to sit down on a bench to enjoy the serenity and beauty of the garden without being bothered by a crowd of people. There were many professional photographers setting up their cameras on tripods. I thoroughly enjoyed Japanese garden around the pond. By 11:30am I noticed that more visitors began to arrive. So I decided to leave without going to see French and English gardens. I saw several people lined up at the ticketing counter. As I walked back to Sendagaya station, a stream of people going to the garden carrying their lunch. I remembered about the Japanese tradition of eating and drinking under the cherry blossoms. It was the best place of all I visited during my 6-day stay to Tokyo during the cherry blossom season."

Because it was a beautiful day, and a Sunday - it was filled with families and groups of friends having bento and looking at the last of the cherry blossoms. But even though there were so many people, it was still relaxing, and the garden has so many paths that it was easy to avoid the crowds.The garden dates back to the beginning of the Edo period, when it was a residence of Naito Kiyonari, then it became the Naito Shinjuku Experimental Farm, cultivating western fruits and vegetables. It then became an Imperial garden but by 1949 it was opened to the public. Although it was the end of the Sakura season, there were still blossoms - the garden has 1,100 cherry blossom trees (65 varieties) there is even a magnolia tree said to date from the Edo period, but that had bloomed before we got there. We saw koi and even some turtles in the ponds. Grab an English map when you buy your ticket, so you don't miss any part of the garden - we ran out of time to see the French Formal Garden, but was glad to see most of the Japanese traditional.Admission fee was \u00a5200 ($2.10 AUD), it's a 5 min walk from each of the 3 stations you can enter by - Shinjuku-Gyoenmae, Shinjuku-Sanchome or Kokuritsu-Kyogijo The JR line station is JR Sendagaya or JR Shinjuku Closed Mondays unless it is a public holiday. (Although open everyday during Spring and Autumn) hours are 9an - 4pm."

Each corner you turned afforded a even better view with stunning landscaping and beautiful trees. There was a small tea house where for 750 yen you received a small bowl of green tea and a sweet served by a lovely Japanese lady in a kimono. Must see garden in Tokyo. Plenty of public toilets and vending machines selling iced drinks. There was also a small stall selling delicious sushi bento boxes which we ate in one of the rest area pavilions. Beautiful place!!!"

Now this is the number one spot in Tokyo when you just seat down, chat with friends, drink and be merry underneath all those beautiful cherry blossoms. I went here around hanami and what a sight it was! Several different kinds of cherry trees were blooming and thousands were line up in this enormous park. It was literally sublime! The Japanese garden was probably the best. Already went here twice, last time it was during autumn. The trees were crimson red and were quite beautiful as well. But nothing beats being in Japan than just staring into those beautiful, pink cherry blossoms. A must see!"

However, Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden exceptionally maintains beautiful natural scenery. In case you want to rest in the bosom of nature, why don't you stop by it? In particular, it's good season to visit here in spring and autumn because various flowers bloom one after another. Only the biginnings of April, it's congested due to the cherry-blossom season, I recommend you go there in the morning. Finally, please make sure drinking alcohol is prohibited in this park."

If you have an afternoon it is worth a stroll or a picnic. Lots of school children were playing and business people took their afternoon lunches in the park. However, if you are looking for the party park, it is Ueno. I've included some of the pretty photos of cherry blossoms here."

A short walk from Shinjuku station and you are right in the heart of cherry blossoms in the middle of the city. The crowds will be there but there is enough room to walk around and find a spot to enjoy a hamani.They are checking that you don't bring in alcohol so be respectful and don't try. Grab a box lunch from the station or a food store nearby. Make sure to have plenty of memory on your camera! A walk around the park to get your bearings is useful then go back for photos or wait for crowds to pass by to get less crowded shots. With all the people sports such as frisbee or throwing/kicking a ball will be met with rude stares. Be nice and leave the sports at home for this one in sakura season.There are plenty of toilets and food to be had once in the park. It does close around 4PM even in peak season so don't plan to go late or you will be hurried out along with all the other onlookers."

The best portions were the Japanese and Chinese gardens. The other European style gardens were more expansive. Since we got there early, it wasn't as crowded as Ueno Park in the Asakusa area of Tokyo which was wall to wall people sitting on their red blankets for their traditional picnics/drinking parties. Even without the cherry blossoms, this is a very beautiful park almost as nice as the Imperial Palace East Garden in downtown Tokyo."

It offers a peaceful retreat in the midst of a huge city. The experience of looking up to see a canopy of blossoms above my head was truly unforgettable. We also took some great \"selfies\" with the blossom trees. Shinjuku was a relief after experiencing the crowds elsewhere, especially at Ueno Park and Yoyogi Park. There were lots of photographers at Shinjuku Gyoen, but everyone seemed calm and very appreciative of the beautiful surroundings.Given that there is not a party atmosphere at this park, they do not allow alcohol -- they even sniffed my water bottle when I entered. Expect to see lots of families setting up picnics beneath the trees."

We also had a strong wind blowing the petals around like snow, it was a great vista! Call me a grump, but places like this are always crowded at the best times, and it was hard to move for the other tourists and locals jamming up the pathways and bridge. It was almost impossible to take a photo without other people in it, it got frustrating quickly for me, but wasn't really the parks fault. Overall a great place to see the cherry blossoms!"

The park has numerous early and late blooming cherry trees which provide an extended cherry blossom viewing season. This is good for those who miss the main season. Shinjuku Gyoen Garden is the best place in Tokyo to view the cherry blossom during spring season. From the garden, the best landmark sight is the NTT Docomo building which is featured in some of the movies such as Ultraman, Superman and Godzilla. Located just a short walk from Shinjuku StationFor more info and pictures, kindly visit my blog:http://tummyfull.blogspot.com/2014/04/sakura-season-at-shinjuku-gyoen.html"

The park was easily accessible by train and within walking distance of all stations nearby. You can check out the official website for the stations that have access to the park. Admission fee is only 200 yen and is well worth it. We arrived early to have a head start before all the Chinese tourists arrived. We were able to take some great pictures before the park got really crowded due to the very very many Chinese tourists. The park opens at 9am and it's best to arrive early so your pictures won't have a lot of people in the background. The Chinese tourists were very aggressive when taking pictures, they are very load and all over the place. But overall, we enjoyed our visit to the park."

One thing I enjoyed most was taking the time to use all my senses, to listen, touch and smell. This was my first experience of Cherry Blossoms, but there is so much more to see.On a practical side disability access is well catered for and public toilets abound.

I spent at least three hours just wandering through its Japanese, French, and English gardens, as well as its green house. I enjoyed the peace and quiet amidst Tokyo's - and Shinjuku's - hecticness. If you crave a little green space, you must check this place out! Pack a picnic and just soak up the calmness of it all."

The Shinjuku park is one of the biggest in Tokyo, and probably the one in which one has the biggest feeling of being outside of the crowded metropolis that is Tokyo. The entrance of the park is underwhelming, but the more you walk towards the japanese garden the better it gets. And when you head back to the Shinjuku gate you get a central park-ish experience with the row of modern buildings you can see on the horizon.I went to the park in January, and I'm looking forward to going back in spring to experience the park in its blossoming state.This park is a great for families or couples. It looks great for picnics although it's not really a japanese thing and I haven't tried it on my own. The entrance fee is cheap (200 yens/adult I believe)."

We can only imagine what the garden must be like full of hanami parties as we are used to seeing in Ueno Koen.The autumn colors were a bit past prime the first week in December, but were still beautiful. The pond offered some excellent photo ops as did Momijiyama. The Japanese garden was our favourite section and the (Taiwan) pavilion provided some great viewing points in addition to being a focal point for photos. We found the formality of the rose gardens boring by comparison.Look for pods of photographers on hills, around the ponds, near the bridges. Someone in every crowd has already found the best spot for the best photo angles. Entry fee was \u00a5200. We spent about 4 hours here and got snacks for lunch at the rest house.

It would be a lovely escape if you were in Tokyo for an extended period of time or if you were from somewhere where this sort of greenery is unusual but for us, there wasn't anything particularly standout about the gardens themselves. I guess maybe it's because we're from Australia and we're a little spoiled for flora over here - there's lots of gardens like this one at home. If you're a flora buff however or a photography nut you'll probably enjoy it. It's a paid garden but it's a really cheap entry fee.

These include a French formal garden, an English landscaped garden with a stunning view of Shinjuku and Tokyo Tower, a greenhouse, a tea house, and a traditional Japanese garden.

And it is a huge green space in the middle of a vibrant city. The current garden format was completed early in the 20th Century under the guidance of a French designer. Highlights of the garden include a classical Japanese garden along with a formal French and English landscape garden. The strength of the garden is its wild forest character rather than the faux French or English gardens which are either very run down or in a poor state of management. The Japanese garden is also very ordinary by domestic standards and does not compare with something like the Kenrokuen garden in Kanazawa. In fact the formal components of the Gyoen are a non event. But that said the wild chaotic nature of what remains is still a breath of fresh air."

Shinjuku Gyoen located approximately a 10 minute walk from the New South Exist of JR Shinjuku Station or a 5 minute walk from Shinjukugyoenmae Station on the Marunouchi Subway Line. It is like an oasis surrounding by skyscrapers of Shinjuku. This park was originally constructed during the Edo Period as a feudal lord, Lord Naito\u2019s private residence. It was converted into a botanical garden before being transferred to the Imperial Family as the imperial garden for recreation and entertaining guests, it was re-designated as a national garden after the Second World War and eventually reopened to the public. Since then, it is one of Tokyo\u2019s largest and most popular parks. With 58.3 ha(144 acres) in size and a circumference of 3.5 km, it blends three distinct styles, French Formal Garden, English Landscape Garden and Japanese Traditional Garden. From late March to mid April, a large number of cherry trees blossom around the English garden turning the lawns into one of Tokyo\u2019s most popular and pleasant hanami spots. It is also nice to visit during autumn when the leaves change colours around the park, especially the maple trees around the Japanese garden and Momijiyama on the eastern side of the park. We stayed in a hotel facing this beautiful park for a week in late March 2014 but only managed to visit this park once. This year, the cherry trees opened late but the views were still spectacular and like many visited the park, we brought bento and drinks from a departmental store nearby for hanami in the park, the experience was really unforgettable. If you happen to visit Tokyo during the Sakura period, you should really consider wondering around or simply resting/sleeping at the beautifully maintained lawns within this park. We were really glad we did so during our last visit. Admission: \u00a5200. Open 9am-4pm (Gates close at 4:30pm). Closed Mon (If Mon is a public holiday, close the following day) & 29 December to 3 January. No closure day during cherry blossom season from late March to late April."

In terms of ground area, Shinjuku Gyoen is probably the fourth-largest park in Tokyo after the gardens of the Imperial Palace and Akasaka/Togu Palace, as well as Yoyogi Park although the former two aren't really open to the public. With origins dating back to the 17th century, the current park was rebuilt right after World War 2. Paths crisscross manicured lawns and sculptured bushes or shrubs. Highlights include the Taiwan pavilion which is a part of the Japanese gardens, a French-style garden, and a tree-lined English garden. But this park is best known for being a hotspot during the annual cherry blossom season when it's packed. With the index cases for the current outbreak of dengue fever occurring at Yoyogi Park, located southwest from Shinjuku Gyoen, it's a pity that the park had to shut its gates in early-September. However, with the fumigation efforts completed, the park re-opened in mid-October to the benefit of all visitors. Just remember to avoid Mondays outside of cherry blossom season because it's closed."

I was hoping to get to this beautiful park as I had seen so many reviews however I walked to the park today (the 12th of October) and the park is still closed due to mosquitoes that may have contracted dengue fever so before you go, check to see if it's open as you don't want a wasted trip. It looks gorgeous from the pictures I've seen and from walking outside it, the sound of the birds and tall green tree's definitely makes it sound and look like a haven within such a busy city."

I am particularly impressed by the views that are adjacent to the many ponds within the park, and the fact that sakura were plenty during my visit probably made the experience even better. Shinjuku Gyoen also offers a good view of some of the tallest structures in Shinjuku, the closest of which is the grand Docomo tower. The tropical greenhouse may also interest a few people especially those who haven't really experienced tropical flora.I have placed some of my shots of Shinjuku Gyoen within this post:http://intheeyesofanadiq.blogspot.jp/2014/04/in-photos-my-first-hanami.htmlHope it helps!"

I was particularly impressed by the Japanese garden area that had bridges linking various islands in a lake filled with fish.The park is kept clean and orderly by the attendants, and everyone is very relaxed. Various people were walking around, lying in the grass, or painting flowers. There are lots of facilities as well such as toilets and places to purchase refreshments. The maps on display and signposts make navigation straight-forward too.I was only here for an hour or so, but wish I could/should have spent a bit longer. Definitely at least a half-day visit."

It's a rather gray neighbourhood with high-rise buildings and office workers everywhere. That might be why Shinujku Gyoen is so contrasting. The large open spaces of the front garden and the refined style of the French garden work together with the peaceful Japanese garden section to bring you a blast of nature right in the middle of Shinjuku.There is a small fee for entry, but it's well worth it, especially so on cherry blossom season, which seems to last nearly a month, due to different sorts of cherry trees.Access is quite easy with several subway stations nearby."

The garden has 58.3 hectares (144 acres) with a border of 3.5 km (2.17 mile) across Shinjuku and Shibuya. The original site of Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden was part of the Edo residence given to Kiyonari Naito in 1590. The current Shinjuku Gyoen was an Imperial garden completed in 1906. After World War II, the garden was opened to the public under jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Today, the garden is under jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Environment. It was a welcome move because the people in the Greater Tokyo area now have a beautiful oasis and relaxing garden in the center of the city. One additional benefit is that the entrance fee is only \uffe5200, which was the cheapest entrance fees of our entire 2 week trip.We were there after lunch, and the weather was overcast. We entered the garden from Shinjuku Gate. The large map with or without your preferred language will let you better navigate and plan your route in the garden. Basically, they have four gardens: Japanese Traditional garden, English Landscape garden, French Formal gardens, and Mother and Child\u2019s garden. You will get good exercise by just walking through all the gardens. Because we arrived in the afternoon and the garden closed at 4:30 pm, we picked the Japanese Traditional garden as our primary area to explore. Walking inside the garden was quite pleasant, and we spent some time in the Upper Pond (KAMINO-IKE, \u4e0a\u306e\u6c60). The view was exceptional, especially in the center of Tokyo. Nearby, we found a Japanese teahouse - RAKUU-TE (\u697d\u7fbd\u4ead) and decided to have some traditional Japanese tea. We were surprised to learn that we needed to purchase tickets for the \u201cGreen Tea with Japanese Sweet\u201d from a machine. The price was expensive, \uffe5700 for a cup of tea and a small sweet. We then went to the Taiwan Pavilion (\u65e7\u5fa1\u51c9\u4ead, KYU-GORYO-TEI) where you can have a great view of the garden on the 2nd level. We really wanted to see the rest of the gardens, but the time was almost 4:30 pm. We went out from the Sendagaya Gate. Next time, if we visit Tokyo again, I certainly will come to completely visit the other gardens.The garden is famous for when the cherry blossoms in spring. Sinjuku Gyoen is an ideal place year round to get close to nature. You can enjoy the colorful leaves of autumn, greens of summer, and the snows in the winter. You can easily reach the garden via subway or bus. The ticket booth opens from 9 am to 4 pm except on Mondays and between December 1st to January 4th."

Enjoy your walk as it could prove the only time for peace, solitude and tranquillity you find in vibrant Tokyo. It's a wonderful, wonderful garden to enjoy.

There was a sign stating that entry was free in a couple of days time, so if you are budget concious this could be a good thing for you to check. The gardens are just beautiful, especially around the pond/lake area with a stunning view of the NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building. I would recommend packing a picnic lunch and taking some time to sit under a beautiful tree and soak in the fact you're at a real Japanese garden."

Conveniently located within the city, this is the most beautiful refuge to go to when you think you've had enough of Tokyo's modern eclecticism and vibrancy. It's just a short walk from the JR Line Shinjuku Station and once your weary feet brings you to this patch of heaven, it is almost always assured that you will be recharged just by taking in sights of this masterpiece.Everything is just so serene and calm that you can't help but look for the nearest comfortable spot, take a seat back, kick off those walking shoes and relax and bask in such majestic beauty. Of course, you also have the option to roam around Japanese-, English- and French-style gardens to fully appreciate the layout and terrain and the well-manicured flowering trees and shrubs.Admission price is only around 200 yen or about 2 USD; you can not NOT go in. You deserve to see such beauty!!"

The well landscaped gardens were truly a sight to behold, made even more special by the clouds of blossoms above your head.

The garden is huge (58 acres) and it has over 3 km of walkway to stroll through its various sections. While the number of cherry trees is said to be 1,500, it did not show as overwhelming as many other sakura viewing spots in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka where I also visited for the same purpose in this trip and where the cherry trees are more concentrated. However, the extremely nice setting of the Garden with more variety of other trees, especially the old and towering ones, and the presence of ponds here and there make the cherry trees stand out even more. Probably because of the cherry blossom season, there was plenty of tourists but even more locals who picnicked everywhere in the Garden under the shades of those lovely cherry trees. The scene was one of tranquility and peaceful coexistence of man and nature just steps from the reality of city life.I really admire the locals who find time to relax and enjoy life in such fashion and I started to realize that this is what life should be. A reminder about cherry blossom viewing: one can check on the internet the Country's forcast on the full blossom periods of each year for each locale which I presume last for two to three weeks only. That is how I decided on the time frame of my visit but of course inclement weather is never predictable and if not for rain and wind a couple of days before my arrival, my local friend said that I could have seen a even fuller blossom. That has to wait for my next time around which I think is definitely worth it! And do spend sometime in the Park and bring your own food to laze around and enjoy mother nature to its fullest."

It closes at 4:30PM, you cannnot bring alcohol and they check your bag during cherry blossom season (because Japanese people love to drink sake under cherry trees,) and no pets, bicycles, ball games.One thing you have to be careful:There are four gates; sendagaya gate, okido gate, sinjuku gate and main gate, but the main gate is almost always closed. I often see tourists who look lost in front of the main gate.sinjuku gate is near sinjuku san-chome station, okido gate is near sinjuku gyoen station, sendagaya gate is near sendagaya station."

Nothing much going on. You don't actually witness a ceremony. It's basically just paying for tea. It's a good tea though. And yes, you buy the ticket from the machine first, then you walk in.Tip: - there are 2 entrances, one south and one north. Might save you the hassle of walking all around the park to get to the main entrance.- It's accessible by JR train, if you have the pass.- Also, forget the French garden. Horrible.

Walking around the gardens is relaxing and leaves you with a sense of awe. When you are tired with the hustle and bustle of the streets of Tokyo this is where you should go to recharge. It's simply beautiful!"

I visited there last weekend and there were so crowded but I thought the cherry blossoms hadn't not in full bloom yet. This weekend and the following weeks could be the best. Don't miss it if you were in Tokyo at this moment. Enjoy picnic under the cheery trees! The park itself is huge.Note: drinking alcoholic is not allowed in this park. The Shinjuku gate is often too crowded, especially spring Hanami season. I recommend to use the Okido gate."

It was my second time to the park to view sakura. Around the same time few years back, sakura was in full bloom. This time round, sakura season supposedly has ended even my Japanese friends said so. I was blessed to insist to come by myself as I read that the late blooming varieties are full bloom during that weekend. Although not as pretty as the first time I visited, it is still well worth the trip. Very pretty and neat park."

The park is big, and we could spend hours just strolling around embracing all the sights of gigantic cherry trees, shrugs, hedges or just sit on the lawn enjoying the sound of bustling Tokyo. So peaceful and calm, and the best, not crowded at all! Our guide book indicated that the park was open 24H, turns out that the closing time was 17.00, on a Friday, so didn't get to stroll to all corners of this green heaven. But can only highly recommend, if time is short. Ueno park is an alternative for cherry blossoms watching, but far more crowded, hustle and bustle."

This park is very expansive and excellent for a stroll and is incredibly peaceful considering it is locating in the centre of Tokyo! It has large open grassed areas, Japanese styled sections with ponds and bridges, formal English and French Gardens and a greenhouse. For me the highlight is the pond with the lovely old Japanese teahouse overlooking it. This area is particularly stunning at cherry blossom time as there are some lovely cherry blossom trees that frame the lovely Japanese building beautifully for photo purposes! It is not uncommon to see bridal couples in their lovely traditional bridal dress having photos taken at this park. There is also another lovely bridge area right next to some cherry blossom trees which makes for more stunning photos during cherry blossom time. If you wander around the whole park you will also encounter a less formal part of the garden with small ponds and creeks and a lot of wildlife. This area was beautiful in autumn.In autumn, the range of colours is also fabulous especially the maple trees. Near the formal french and english gardens, the bed of fallen autumn leaves was almost knee deep!The park is easy to access from Shinjuku station and entry fee is 300 yen. Drink machines and toilets are available as well as a tearoom but limited food options are available so i would suggest bringing food like a bento box for a picnic if you are there are lunchtime."

The place is huge and is conveniently arranged depending on the types of gardens. The park is especially beautiful in spring, when the cherry blossoms are in bloom. You can spend hours just strolling around, taking photos, and sitting on park benches. You'd totally forget that you're in the middle of a bustling city, full of restaurants, shops, and crowds of people. It's like a silent sanctuary in Shinjuku.It's also an ideal place for cherry blossom spotting. They have lots of varieties of cherry trees here, some bloom earlier and some later than others, so it's possible to see some cherry blossoms even after the cherry blossom season. This is a must-visit when touring Tokyo."

I'd have loved to have dedicated a few hours to this parks, even in Autumn.I can appreciate that I was seeing the park at its worse - it was cold and there was no blossom, no green grass. It was beautiful though. There were trees that had beautiful colours on their leaves and lovely places to sit and watch the koi in the water. A great place to go to take photos, to sit and watch the world go by, perhaps not so much a place to adventurers looking for lots to do.I went around the park on my own and felt completely safe and content, but there were a number of lovely old couples sitting around the park, which was lovely.

It's a 5-10 minute walk from Shinjuku station, but there are other subway stations that are a little closer to the entrance to the park. Note that the park does have a 200 yen entrance fee - and the park hours are a bit restrictive. It closes around 4:30 PM (1630) and the entrance into the park closes 30 minutes earlier. The greenhouse also closes earlier - I recall it was either 3:30 PM (1530) or 4:00 PM (1600), so you have to plan accordingly. It is also quite a big park so you'll need some time, around at least two hours, to have adequate time to traverse the park.One of the nice things about the park is the large number of families. During my trip in Tokyo, I didn't see too many families congregated in places other than a park like this, so you can do a little bit of people watching here as well. Unfortunately, I didn't get to go into the greenhouse so I do not know how it is. The park grounds were nicely kept - what do you expect from a Japanese garden/park? The Japanese traditional garden was serene and picturesque. The French formal garden seemed a little dull, but perhaps it was late fall. The ponds that dotted the park were especially beautiful. Of particular note were the chrysanthemum displays all around the park. Many were spectacular and beautiful.There are probably more memorable sights in Tokyo, but if you have time to visit this park, then I would highly recommend it."

On a fine day, if you have a couple of hours to spend for a quiet walk under the trees, through gardens, to sit or lie down on grass, or see tropical flowers in the glasshouse, do visit this place. Shinjuku Gyoen is particularly nice in Spring with different kinds of cherry trees and in Autumn with gingko and maple trees. The large gingko tree in front of the glasshouse was marvelously brightly yellow when I visited in late November 2013, a sight to remember. Shinjuku Gyoen started as a property of the Naito clan trusted by the Tokugawa Shogunate, then became an Imperial Garden, before it was donated to the city.In contrast to Yoyogi Park or Ueno Park (which is always open), this is an enclosed garden (which takes 200 yen for upkeeping). Taking food and drinks in is fine (and quite recommended), but no alcohol. No soundsystem to dance to. No pet entry or frisby/kites either here. Which is in fact good, because the lawns are maintained like carpets and when you lie down and close your eyes for a nap, you only hear the birds singing and kids playing about.Stroller friendly.Shinjuku Gyoen, and Rikugien (near JR Komagome Station on Yamanote Line), are gardens worth visiting, and paying a couple of coins for upkeeping, with thanks.The nearest access are provided by JR Sendagaya station (Chuo/Sobu Local Line), and Tokyo Metro Shinjuku Gyoen station (Marunouchi Line)."

We were surprised that there were several trees in bloom as it was early November but it was a nice perk. The Chrysanthemum Festival was interesting, the kids really enjoyed the displays. I'd also suggest a walk through the greenhouse, beautiful presentation and again, the kids loved it."

We visited the park on mid October after reading so many good reviews on TripAdvisor. Another reason was due to most shops/attraction would not be open until after 10am, so a morning stroll in a park I thought would be very ideal before visiting the nearby attractions.Depends on what are you looking for.. if you wish to see a peaceful huge park or an escape from the busy city then this is something for you. However, Tokyo is not a right choice if this is what you looking for in your trip. Sorry but I think this is over-rated for me (IMHO). Don't come here just for the park. Do it only if you are an early riser."

However, thanks to the personnel at JTB, who recommended us to visit Gyoen National Garden, we managed to see the pink and white cherry blossoms, although at the end of their blossoming period, was still something to be admired. We were so enthralled by the beautifully landscaped and well maintained garden, and busily taking photos, of the myriads of flowers of different species, e.g various colours of tulips, poppies, roses etc. that we did not even notice that the weather was turning pretty chilly, until we felt our fingers getting numb. Apart from the flowers, there was a tranquil lake with lots of trees and flowers surrounding it. Took a photo of this and it now acts as my telephone wallpaper, a memento of my day at the Shinjuku Gyoen National Park. It was definitely worth the 200 Yen entrance fee.One could easily spend the whole day there just walking and appreciating the natural scenery in all its splendour and get away from the \"hustle and bustle\" of city life. One great aspect of the park is that, not only is it open to people but also to our \"four legged\" friends . I just loved watching all the cute little dogs, some in their best finery, trotting happily alongside their owners. Photos do not do justice to the park. We were fortunate to have visited the park at the right time and in my opinion, it was beautiful beyond description."

Tokyo is densely populated and land is scarce but when it comes to parks and garden - they had the discipline to keep it pristine and \"untouched\" by commercial development. If it had been in any other country, this garden/park would have been turned into a commercial district to generate income. The place is so beautiful and the contrast is stark. There are spots were its like you are in a forest, as in Lord-of-the-Rings-forest, with hundred-year old trees, with very dense and damp vegetation (actually gave me the creeps that we never passed through it again on our way back) then there are the very Zen Japanese gardens. In some parts of the garden, you have this very serene pond against skyscrapers. Picture-perfect. This place is great for family bonding and just chilling out. Not to be missed."

Its ponds and bridges are enchanting and the large expanses of lawn provide plenty of space to sit or lie down. There are hundreds of little areas to sit and contemplate or eat a picnic lunch. The greenhouse housed many many beautiful varieties and a wonderful design of water lilies. I would return to this park daily if I lived here.

Tickets are bought from ticketing machines. There's basically 3 main gardens, English Landscape Garden, French Formal Garden and Japanese Traditional Garden. It will take some time to walk the garden. You can buy some food and drinks (no alcohol) into the gardens. If you feel tired after walking, you can just sit down and have a picnic on the grounds or the rest areas.

Luckily we had some trees with Cherry Blossoms although nothing like the stunning views I've seen in so many pictures. The Cherry Blossoms do add an extra dimension to the Gardens, but they are still very much worth a visit. Walking around, it is difficult to think that you're in the middle of the busiest city in the world. Indeed, the gardens are nowhere near the size of say Central Park which makes it even more extraordinary. The Gardens themselves are packed with wide-open spaces and plenty of tranquil spots to escape and conduct some zen-like meditation. Take your time wandering about - the constant rush that you feel elsewhere in Tokyo is not present here. Enjoy wandering, admiring the gardens and the backdrop against the skyline of Tokyo."

The large open field on the other end of the park reminded me of central park in NYC as you can see the other large buildings above the trees.

Unfortunately we only had an hour to spare, so we actually only got to see the Japanese gardens but every angle was a perfect picture opportunity. The place was huge and there were areas there where you can relax to draw, paint or eat sushi (like what we did). We do hope to visit this place again, this time to stay for at least half a day and hopefully see the cherry blossoms.

Just a few minutes walk from the busiest streets of Shinjuku, it's a huge park for casual strolls, with English-, French and Chinese-style gardens, Mother-and-Son Forest, tea house, restaurant, museum, a superb tropical greenhouse, ... The sakura season starts from approximately mid-March and lasts through early April, but even out of the sakura season it's a lovely place to visit. If you exit from Sendagaya Gate (south gate), Harajuku and Omotesando are just a 20-mn pleasant walk away so you can easily continue your exploration of Tokyo."

Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden is a sprawling, beautifully landscaped park that is very serene in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The entrance is 200Y, with tickets bought at a vending machine at the gate. Once in the park, you have a myriad of options in which direction to walk. Gardens with different themes and lakes surrounded by flowers await you! There is also a very large greenhouse with a variety of worldwide fauna.There are snacks and refreshments available in the park. Plan ahead as there are no trash cans that I found (which is common in Tokyo anyway). Also, if you're a smoker, only do so in the designated areas. The only ones I saw were near the gates.The open grassy areas are huge with plenty of room for you to picnic, or simply spread out and take in the ambiance."

Don't forget to bring a camera (or at least pocket camera or iPhone) to come here. Because anytime you shot the shutter button to catch an image, I guarantee you will get a good picture, whatever the angle. :)It just cost JYP 200 to enter this place, and you can easily find a good spot for Hanami with your girlfriend, family or colleague. Also, I think it is perfect place for someone who want to purpose his girlfriend, in the lovely weather and freaking stunning scenery.If you ever come to Shinjuku, don't miss this place on your itinerary list!Here some pictures that I took while ago.

All of them are very good, especially the French formal and the Japanese traditional. The French Formal during autumn is very nice especially with the tree-lined avenues. When the leaves fall on the paths, it is very romantic. It also has a nice rose garden. The Japanese garden is great all year round with its central pond and tea house.In 2012 the new greenhouse opened. An all glass building it is very attractive with lots of beautiful flowers and plants inside (and very steamy so be careful if you have a camera, because it will fog up). The park also provides some great photo opportunities: the cherry blossoms in spring and in autumn the beautiful leaves. The other great photo shot, is to stand in the English landscape garden and look back towards Shinjuku. You can get some incredible shots with the skyscrapers soaring over the trees. It really is inspring."

On the weekend of 24-25 March the Sakura was full bloomed and we had the best picnic. Arriving at 10am, there was still lots of good picnic spots under cherry blossom trees. The best thing about Shinjuku Gyoen is that Alcohol and smoking is prohibited so the park is family friendly and clean. I been to Ueno Park for Hanami and although there were loads of sakura, the vibe was so different- it was fully packed and noisy and there were beer cans everywhere. The other good thing about Shinjuku Gyoen is that is has a variety of Sakura, with many colors and different types- the draping sakura branches is one of the best :) Plus they also have a nice traditional Japanese garden... a nice stroll around the japanese area feels so peaceful, with the tiny pond with ducklings. They also have a tea house too. Only 700 yen for a set of green tea and sweet! The park is closest from Shinjuku Sanchome station exit c1. Get a bento set from Isetan or Kinokuniya food store for a picnic at the park! The entry to the park is 200 yen per person. Such a cheap price to pay considering how beautiful and clean the park is! Definitely a must go!"

Families are plentiful, so expect a lot of children running around and having fun. Gardens, of course, are everywhere and there's even a French-style one. There is also a beautiful modern greenhouse with an abundant inventory of Japanese flora in exhibit. I would recommend coming here on a Sunday morning to just relax and recover after a busy week."

We visited where the foliage was started to turn red, russet, bronze and gold, and it was stunning. There was also a rogue cherry blossom tree in bloom with plenty of Japanese crowding around it to capture an image! If you hail from a Western country, then the French and English gardens can be given a miss. The Japanese garden however is substantial and very lovely.

This made me think of North Korea or some other police state. I will never go again during that season.We also attended the recently re-designed and renewed greenhouses. I find these a disappointment on the old greenhouses. The area of space is smaller, there is only information in Japanese (it is surprisingly retarded in this respect seeing that has just been totally replaced from scratch). The old ones had a charm and wildness that were more like Kew. The new greenhouse seems overly designed. I think that as long as you avoid the sakura season, it is a nice park to attend."

It's a nice break from the helter skelter of Tokyo, and very easy to find. If you want to just sit and take a few hours to relax, this is a good place to do it."

So I had high expectations.We walked for a while and I kept thinking......it's a big open space which is very clean but that was it.....then we turned a corner and were in one of the largest and most beautiful style Japanese gardens I've ever seen. It was absolutely stunning.It was a very hot day when we were there so we spent a while just sitting on a bench, in the shade watching the world walk slowly past. There are plent of places to take some beautiful pictures and even watching the men trim the trees and bushes into well manicured shapes was a delight.I loved it here...my only disappointment was having to leave after only 1.5 hours. I wish we'd had longer as there was so much more to explore!"

Lots shade, a love stream and a nice walking path make this an ideal spot for city-dwelling dog owners. Shinjuku Gyoen is especially popular during the Sakura Cherry Blossom Season.

If you enjoy nature and the serenity it provides, visit this garden when you are in Shinjuku.My wife and I almost spent an entire day strolling through the vast garden during the cherry blossom season in April. It was drizzling on and off. The drizzle and cloudy sky provided a richness to the colours in the garden, a dream come true for photographers. Best of all, the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. As it was drizzling, the garden was not crowded and we enjoyed the garden at a leisurely pace.From expansive lawn to manicured landscaping and scenic ponds, great care has been taken to nurture the garden to its current beautiful form. Each tree and shrub, each pathway and bench seemed to have its own place in the garden. Viewed together, it's like an arrangement into a score of music. Ever so often, we would stop and just take in the scenery of nature before us!In the fast paced world we live in, this garden is a sanctuary."

The body just relaxed in an instance. This must be contributed by the mass amount of plants and the centre lake. Each plant species is clearly labeled! I managed to spot cherry!!! No more sakura as it was June :) But, who cares! The trees, leaves and the cherry is as attractive. The lake gave a picturesque reflections of the beautiful flowers at the lakeside. The clear water gave us a chance to see the tortoises and koi swimming freely in the lake. Almost at the time of leaving the park, a strong fragrance of roses surrounded us at a corner of the park.

I stayed much longer than I had planned, and even then had to tear myself away. This is a brilliant place to experience the magic of cherry blossom season - they have many different varieties of cherry blossom that bloom at different times, so even if you're early or late for the peak you have a chance to view the blooms here (I believe from mid March to early May? I don't speak Japanese so couldn't say for sure). I missed the Tokyo peak by 10 days or so but the blooms were still going strong all over the gardens. A variety of different landscapes to see and beautifully curated. I'd recommend as a must-see and allow a few hours to soak it up. Wonderful!"

I highly recommend showing up when the park opens at 9 AM, as we did. By the time we left around 11, it was getting a bit too crowded for my tastes. At 9, it was still sparse enough to comfortably jog.When jogging, you can easily do a lap of the park under 30 minutes. If walking, I'd budget about an hour or two to see everything. Of the three main gardens, I'd prioritize the Japanese garden. The French garden was staid and sterile, and the English garden was barely noticeable.There are plenty of bathrooms within, and places that sell snacks. Cherry blossom season was absolutely gorgeous, with many varieties of cherry blossoms. If it's windy, you'll be occasionally blasted by sakura-fubuki (cherry blossom petal blizzard)!Highly recommended, and well worth the 200Y entrance fee, but again, go at 9 am."

Adding to the experience, we almost had the place to ourselves, apart from a handful of ground staff and gardeners. At every turn there seemed to be another photo opportunity.

There are very large very well kept grass areas for children to run around. However the Japanese Garden is quite disappointing. If Huntington Library rates a 10, then this park is only about 7.\nAdmission is $200 Yen."

We enjoyed every minute, every step and every sitting area. The fee you pay is nominal. You could stay a while and enjoy their little dining room or just plan to come back."

Only at the south gate you will can hear some cars, otherwise this is a perfect place to walk and see trees, birds and extotic coloured flowers. Extremely clean and safe, is good for everyone. A good place to walk, sit, relax and forget for a while the crowd of Tokyo."

            "review": "Sanctuary in the City. This was our favorite park/garden in the Tokyo area (and we visited many). It costs a few hundred yen to get in but was worth the cost. We visited on a July morning. The park was almost empty and we enjoyed strolling through the gardens and admiring the different types of trees, many are very old and large. The park is divided into sections with different types of gardens. We enjoyed the Japanese garden section the best. It was very tranquil. The large open field on the other end of the park reminded me of central park in NYC as you can see the other large buildings above the trees. I think because they charge admission, there are no homeless people in the park and it was very well maintained. If you have limited time in Tokyo and want to see a garden, or if you need to escape the bustling streets this is your place to be."
