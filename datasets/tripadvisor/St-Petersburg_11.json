There is strict crowd control here so there was no jostling for position to see the treasures inside the glass cases. The tour guide for our Road Scholar group provided in-depth explanation of the highlights so, if available I'd recommend using an audio tour to understand the history and significance of these treasures."

This is a must see - not only for the artifacts - but the building is worthy also. We could only afford 1 hour there but could have easily stayed there for a total of 2 hours. Don't miss it !!!"

There is a significant amount of other exhibits but the eggs are the main attraction and are worth your time. Advance tickets were not a problem, we just dropped in with our guide."

We chose to include this museum visit instead of the tour with 2 more churches and a hydrofoil ride. Very glad we did. The museum building itself is impressive and the contents incredible. You can preview the Museum online at their own website. Our visit was better with a guide and only 16 of us. Got to see things up close at the same time as our guide was talking about them! This museum and the subway ride (great!) were not possible via our cruise ship. See also my review on Alla Tours - highly recommended."

We wanted to visit the gold room but tickets are very difficult to obtain and were advised to go here instead and we are so glad we did.It has not been open that long, about 3 years we understand, and is privately owned. You can book tours on line in your chosen language or you can book an entrance ticket for a given time slot. We were visiting in October which is not in the high season so decided to just turn up and were admitted straight away. We paid 600 rubels each which included an audio guide which I would recommend (we had to leave 1000 rubels cash deposit for each one but paid the entrance fee by card). You have to put shoe coverings on which are not easy to put on and not very big either.Once inside we were overwhelmed by the variety of Faberge items, the 8 eggs are only a very small part of the museum. There were many enamelled pieces, cigarette cases, boxes, tureens, paintings, just too much to mention.We spent over 2 hours there and were able to take photographs as long as the flash was turned off, we could have stayed longer but were totally Fabereged out by that time. Go before it gets too popular, they do have a maximum number permitted, about 300 I think, but I would not have liked to have been in there with that many people, as well as the organised tours."

I would suggest that you buy online. There is an English website that is actually working (yey). The visit is timed. If you buy a few days ahead, they allow you a 4 hour window. If you buy online last minute, you only have one hour windows. The admission cost is 450 rubles. I would strongly advise renting the audio sets. The rental cost is 150 rubles PLUS 1000 rubles deposit. I would suggest you bring cash as the couple we went with didn't have the cash and had a more difficult time getting the audio sets.The building itself is beautiful, just like the Catherine palace, hermitage, and Peterhof. The highlight is definitely the 9 eggs. They allow photos without flash. The photos one can take are still not as beautiful as the ones that you can get in their photo books. I would advise you to buy your \"souvenir\" book at home. Price is cheaper on amazon or indigo than in their store and you don't have to lug it back home. The Faberge egg replica is also cheaper/same price as back home so no need to pick one up there.The other wings have dishware, paintings, jewelry, and religious icons. You would spend probably 1-.1.5 hours here."

After seeing the wonderful, not to be missed Faberge eggs and other beautiful items in the museum, (the interior of the building is lovely too) we made the mistake of going on a canal boat trip directly outside, branded Faberge Museum. We were reassured bt a young man outside the museum that the commentary was in English. NOT TRUE. We were subjected to an incomprehensible Russian commentary. Furthermore the 'canal trip' was a short section of canal and then a slow journey around the Neva river. We complained and we're told that we didn't ask if it was in English. NOT TRUE.

Her passion for the history of faberge was evident and while she has probably given this tour many many times, it came across as fresh and enthusiastic. She was clearly the best tour guide we had on our entire trip.The highlite was the eggs of course.The museum is located on a renovated mansion that added to the setting.Tour takes about 1 hour so it is a good option if you are time constrained.Note: I booked both entry ticketed and the tour tickets online but it appears that I didn't need to purchase the entry tickets - sigh.There is a cafe on site but we didn't try it."

This is a stunning collection of art - particularly the decorative arts - and the museum isn't just about the Faberge Eggs. But their primacy of their design, materials, craftsmanship, and place in history simply can't be denied.Our trip to St. Petersburg was all too short and I had to be convinced to go 'out of our way' to the Faberge Museum by my wife for whom 'The Eggs' have been a lifelong obsession. But I and everyone else in our extended family were delighted by the museum."

If you do the tour, you will learn about the surprises inside each egg, lost pieces, and other history about the royal family. There is also some silverware, trinkets and paintings on display, but the eggs are the show stoppers.The souvenir shops around the city are crawling with knockoffs of these Faberge eggs, and if you don\u2019t go to the museum you can\u2019t say you saw the diamond and pearl-encrusted real McCoy. If you get there early, there is no line (yes, no massive lines snaking around the block like other museums). The gift shop has small pendants done in the Faberge patterns, at reasonable prices"

It is worth a visit even if it only for the lovely coffee shop with great coffee and cakes."

Don't miss this -- the eggs really ARE incredible, and the palace museum they're housed in is also pretty amazing.

It is crowded, but they allow photos (without flash) and you are not hurried around.

Its a nice collection of exquisite jewellery and includes many other examples of items made by the Faberge workshop over the years. The audio tour takes you through their beginnings to being world respected craftsmen of the highest level - especially enamel work. Aside from the chance to see some of the most famous and valuable works of jewellery in the world, the museum isn't that long (compared to the endless labyrinth of the Louvre of Winter Palace) and you'll be out in an hour or two.

The museum is located in the Shuvalov Palace on the Fontanka River - one of the most beautiful palaces in St. Petersburg and was opened in 2014. This was our favorite museum. It houses the celebrated Faberg\u00e9 collection of the Link of Times Foundation owned by Russian Entrepreneur Viktor Vekselberg, which, with its over 1,500 choice pieces, now easily outranks the comparatively small collection of the Kremlin Armory Museum. The collection includes over 200 objects formerly owned by the Forbes family in New York, in particular their nine Imperial and 6 non-Imperial eggs, all acquired by Mr. Vekselberg in 2004 for over $100 million.The collection has been vastly increased to cover all areas of Faberg\u00e9\u2019s activity - monumental silver, colorful Muscovite enamels, and a multitude of cigarette cases, bell-pushes, frames, clocks and belt buckles in elegant transparent guilloch\u00e9 enamels. We were completely enthralled with the Imperial Eggs as well as the decorative and applied works made by the House of Faberge masters of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The colors on the enamels are breathtaking \u2013 we were told that Carl Faberge used over 100 different colors and that the artisans of today have only been able to reproduce about 40 of them. The Museum is open every day except Friday from 10 am until 9 pm. Admission Fee."

The highlight of the collection is the nine Imperial Faberg\u00e9 eggs which are just stunning. The collection includes the first and the last of the eggs. The first egg was quite modest in design, based on a trinket in the collection of the Danish royal family from which Tsarina was descended. The final egg too, created during the first world war, was also quite modest as befitted the time. In between times the eggs were just stunning. In addition to the Imperial eggs, there is a substantial collection of trinkets and decorative items created by Faberg\u00e9 and his contemporaries which are well worth looking at. The building in which collection is housed is pretty special too - beautifully restored."

You can take as many photos as you like which is different to many St Petersburg museums.As well as the eggs there are some stunning examples of enamel and silver work, though possibly the white backgrounds don't always show the lighter enamels off to their best advantage. Really worth a visit."

But it was the other things too! Not a great fan of enamelling I was amazed by the intricacy of the art on the cigarette cases in particular - I loved the mix of silver work and painting. Also the museum houses a small collection of Russian Art. I do wish our tour had taken us to the Russian Museum as the art in the Hermitage was European and we get that at home. Visited at 6.30 one evening and at 8 (its open until 9) I had all the eggs to myself! Definitely the best time to visit."

This is not a museum for a quick walk through. Not does it have nine exquisite Faberge Eggs made for the Romanov family, but it has cases upon cases of other stunning examples of Russian made decorative items: photo frames, cigarette cases, snuff boxes and more. It is beautifully designed located in the lovely Shuvalov Palace. It is open until 8:45PM and I enjoyed visiting in the evening hours when there were no tour groups. You can take a guided tour during certain hours (check website) but I found the audioguide perfectly wonderful. But I would not visit without a tour or audiogude because you want to hear the fascinating stories of each egg and beautiful object. It is right off Nevsky Prospekt and easy to find."

Lovely building to house the museum - not too busy, plenty of room to move and enjoy the exhibits, audio sets available to assist with explanations and visual experience. The eggs and other exhibits were so intricate and finely made it's no wonder they are worth a fortune. Other rooms in the building contained art and other ornate and 'priceless' items belonging to the Tzars and other wealthy Russians. There is a small gift shop on premises selling a variety of replica eggs and more general items. Well worth a visit. The museum signs say no photography but everyone there was taking photos and videos and none of the numerous and very watchful 'guards' made any move to stop them."

The palace itself is lovely and the art and artifacts are really quite interesting. The audio tour is worth the 150 rubles, but if you prefer, you can use the guide book that is free and available in English in the first room you enter."

This new museum not only has Faberge Eggs, we were so amazed with all of the other items Faberge made - they sparkle and share the history of Russia all in an intimate setting. The jewelry, trinkets, and china are amazing. We were a little confused by the ticketing office. What we realized is that you don't need an actual appointment time unless you want a guided tour. We found the individual ticket + audio tour to be a perfect way to experience Faberge Museum."

The first time it was closed, the second they had stopped selling tickets unless you had pre booked online. This was due to rain making it a popular destination. It does mean that there are not too many visitors at any one time.We finally made it in on our last morning arriving at about 10am, when there was no queue and not many visitors. We hired an audio guide which made it more interesting. Having seen the Faberge exhibition at the Hermitage we were surprised that a lot of the exhibits were from the time of Faberge but by other St Petersberg craftsmen. The museum is well laid out, and allows photos without flash, unfortunately when I changed my camera setting the flash came on unexpectedly and a security guard pounced, I apologised profusely and no more was said.My favourite rooms were the enamelled boxes and the eggs."

Here's why: The amount of gold, art, exhibits, patterns, colours and glitz surpasses my imagination. The museum has \"only\" three floors, but they are surreal.You can reach the museum only on foot. There is a security check at the enterance, and they you proceed to the reception. Tickets can be paid by cash and by credit card. Someone will hand you slippers, and you should leave your belonging in a locker (left from the enterance). Toilets are also there (big, clean).Three floors of the museum are filled with all the decadent/rich/beutiful things of the world. It will take 2-3 hours for a rapid scan. This is a good introductory course for people who are planning to visit Ermitraz.Dress nicely, locals find the visit to a museum as a cultural event.There is a small shop/cafe in the museum, if you are hungry or overwhelmed by the glitz and blitz, cross the river and have a snack in cafe pyrogi (the first building left after you cross the river)."

Amazingly the museum allows photography who so often seems restricted (think the entire Peterhof and the amber room at Catherine Palace)."

The Palace has been beautifully restored and the rooms are spectacular. There is one gallery dedicated to the Faberge Eggs, with each displayed in their own case. (If you have been to the Kremlin you will have seen them tucked into overstuffed cases where you have to spot them for yourself) The other galleries have incredible displays of everything else Faberge produced as well as fine objects produced by his (their ?) contemporaries. You have to don cloth booties to tour the museum which showed me how serious they are about protecting the beautiful restored Palace. The audio guide is well worth it but in addition there are guide books in each room that describe each item in the display cabinets. I felt they could have given more anecdotal information on the eggs, but there were several private english tours roaming the gallery so I just listened in. They also have a lovely little cafe with light snacks tea and coffee etc."

Everything is beautifully lit and displayed unlike the Hermitage which can be very dark. The highlight is of course their fabulous collection of eggs which includes the very first and last eggs made. We came with a guide so not sure how individual ticketing works, but the entries are timed and they limit the number of visitors each day. A big plus because you will actually be able to see and enjoy all the displays. So many amazing things to see you can easily spend several hours although the guide does keep you moving through each room pretty quickly. Ours was getting quite disturbed that there were a few people just roaming from room to room. He said they are usually quite strict about the order you go through the rooms and that you stay with your own group. So.... Be prepared to follow some rules but you will appreciate the orderliness and lack of big crowds. We also enjoyed the gift shop. It's small but has a nice variety of souvenirs and wide range of prices. There's a very guide book for just 200 rubles."

The exhibits are outstanding - and although the Imperial eggs are the stars of the museum there are so many other beautiful objects that the time is just not long enough to see everything. This is the first year that interior photography has been allowed. There is a small shop where you can buy books and souvenirs ( they only take roubles) and staff are friendly yet discreet.

The audio guide needs a cash or cloakroom receipt as deposit but allows you to get a description of the room you are in and it's particular design features and also a description of the content of some of the display cases. You therefore choose the ones you are interested in and only need to listen to those.

True, there are only a selection of Faberge eggs on display but they are magnificent, but there are lots of rooms containing other displays linked to the Faberges and these are excellent. Moreover, the building itself and the paintings therein are worth seeing as well. I had also read conflicting information about how to get in - some sites said you could only enter as part of a guided tour before 18.00. This was not the case. We arrived at 13.45 on a Saturday afternoon; there were no queues and we simply walked in, bought an audio guide along with our ticket, and spent two hours inside. I had read that guided tours were one hour long and did see some people bring whisked through the exhibitions by a guide at great speed. Doing it at your own speed is much nicer. Please note, the museum is closed on Fridays."

We visited as a couple.You can book online, and collect tickets at the desk, or buy on the day.You can hire audio guides, have a guided tour, or just wander around. A returnable deposit is required for each audio guide.You're required to wear overshoes over your shoes, and to check your bag in the lockers in the cloakroom.Photos are allowed, but not with flash.There is a very good cafe, as well as a gift shop. There are guidebooks in English and Russian, however these give relatively little information.The building is exquisite, and the display and artefacts are absolutely amazing.Allow between 1 and 3 hours for your visit - depending on your level of interest.A real gem."

Apparently an Oligarch bought these eggs back from the Forbes family and restored them to Russia. The craftsmanship is awesome and the detailing and mechanisms are truly impressive. The sad bit was that after being the favoirite of the Csars family, the revolution forced Faberge and his family to flee to Paris where he died in Penury. Also, an American company patented the name so any Faberge items you buy now, are pale imitations of the real thing."

We booked the English tour (only one available per day, for groups of 10 people max). Unfortunately, one of the members of the staff informed us that we were not allowed to take photos during our tour, so we left our cameras at the cloakroom with the rest of our things. To our great disappointment, when the tour began, our lovely guide Eugenia, let us know that we WERE allowed to take pictures as long as we didn't use any flashes. So many amazing eggs -and not only-, and we didn't photograph anything...luckily we bought a guide of the museum which included all the exhibits, for a reasonable price, and we have something to remember the museum by. In general, it is a museum well-worth visiting, since it combines great exhibits and information about the history of the creator, that visitors would appreciate. Do not miss it!"

We loved the exhibits in the museum but out visit was made very difficult because we weren't allowed to take in either our pram or the baby rucksack. That meant we had to carry out wriggly 10 month old the whole time. Also, you weren't allowed to leave the tour (which was all in Russian and so nothing more than a means to see what we wanted for us) which meant we felt like we were disturbing others, constantly having to go to the other side of rooms to try and keep the little one quiet. The cafe had no baby seat and there didn't seem to be a baby change. So I'd definitely say you should visit, but if you're in st Petersburg with a baby I would take it in turns to visit rather than taking the baby with you!"

But the building itself is quite lovely, and houses a beautiful collection of items created by the famous designer. It does require climbing some stairs, and a fair bit of standing, but overall, the museum isn't that big. It's in a lovely location, right on the river, and there is a sweet little gift shop.

You cannot visit the museum on your own during the day, so you have to go with a tour group. When I was there they offered tours in Russian, English and French. My friend and I took the one in French and the guide was very nice and resourceful (the good thing with the French visit is that the group was quite small). The museum has 9 Faberge eggs and the exhibition is centered around them to explain the history of Russia. The exhibition is in a newly renovated palace which adds to the visit. I would go back anytime."

This museum is the other end of Nevskiy Eve to the other main sites but worth the trip. Don't be fooled into thinking there are imperial Faberge eggs in the Hermitage. They are all here in this museum so this is the only way to see them. There are also another 9 in the Armoury in Moscow.

To have so many of the faberge eggs in one place plus all the other items including some amazing paintings - in an immaculately restored palace - and all the collection of a single oligarch is an amazing experience.

We had an early evening entrance and could walk about on our own; we used the audioguides at our own pace.The palace itself was fabulous-gorgeous staircases, railings, plasterwork and gilt, chandeliers, sculptures and paintings.The exhibits were far more numerous than I expected! Of course there was the beautiful Blue Room with 'the eggs'- it wasn't too crowded and we were able to look right into each individual showcase for the egg and its surprise. Exquisite detail. I think my favourite egg was the \"Pink Serpent Easter Egg\" clock, but it is very hard to choose just one!Other rooms had displays of hundreds of ornately enamelled items- snuff boxes, combs, opera glasses, spoons, cigarette cases, serving dishes, perfume bottles, silverware, evening bags and more. The detail and the designs were beautiful- lots of art nouveau, which I really enjoy.Make sure you visit the gift shop- it had many items I did not see in any other souvenir shop, and of better quality, that were not exorbitantly priced. Calendars, notepads, cards, books, and jewellery. The replica eggs, and even the egg shaped earrings were quite lovely. Credit cards are accepted too.This was one of our favourite sights during our 2-day tour in St. Petersburg. If you enjoy art treasures, definitely make this unique museum one of your tour stops!"

The daily tours (the only way to see the collection during the day) are regulated so you have to stay with your group and leave the collection when the tour is finished-- no staying behind to glimpse something you might have missed or really admire. HOWEVER they say you can come back in evenings between 6-9 pm ( you still need to buy another ticket) and then just wander around (with or without a rented audio guide) to your hearts' content. We did not rent the audio guide when we returned so I can't speak to its quality-- but every other audio guide in the city was pretty comprehensive solo I'm guessing that this one would've been as well-- in which case, in hindsight, I wish we had just gone in the evening with the rented guide and had the freedom to take our time admiring these wonderfully intricate creations. Either way though-- the collection is really great and an interesting visit."

Thanks to the \"Link of Times Cultura-Historical Foundation\" established by the Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, it is located in in the erstwhile city palace of the Shuvalov family, which has been beautifully restored and is resplendent in its silk covered walls and gilt ornamentation. Viktor Vekselberg bought the famous Forbes collection of Faberge items, including 9 eggs, which are on display, as well as countless other items from the famous workshops. What I did not like, however, was the way the staff hurried us along, as there were so many people wanting to go through the place."

A privately owned and financed museum, it currently hosts 9 of the eggs and their 'surprises' eloquently displayed.This museum only allows groups of about 18 people at a time to move through at a pace that is just enough time to hear the stories of the eggs and other artifacts . Even though my wife and I were on a private tour with SPB, our guide took on another group from SPB at this point to guide them through.The Russian enamel exhibit is also stunning.As mentioned earlier, if you are expecting to languish around the eggs and ponder,, you will be disappointed.After 3 full 10 hour days of touring this was our last stop and It was absolutely worth the visit."

With these two caveats - the entrance foyer is too small and the museum's guides harry the individual tour guides around by the minute (and there are only stairs to the shop and cloaks), this is still well worth visiting.Yes there are only nine eggs and you only get about 2 minutes tops to look at each one but taken overall there is a large amount of exquisite craftsmanship on show. If you go after 6pm you can evidently travel around at your own pace.Disabled? There is a lift up to the first floor level where the exhibition rooms are but it is tucked away and your tour guide will be likely to press on without waiting for you. On our tour we had nearly as long an amount of time allocated to standing in the shop downstairs as going around the gorgeous rooms. The shop has some good stuff, particularly while the exchange rate is at the present (9/15) levels. Good museum guide book."

It's a stunning building and the Faberge eggs and other artefacts are unbelievably intricate and outstanding. Warm inside so leave your coats etc in the cloakroom. You wear booties over your shoes which is so sensible. Faberge was so immensely intelligent in his designs that what you get to see in that collection, you would never see anywhere else in the world.

Entrance fee is currently 300 rubles. It contains a collection of Faberg\u00e9 eggs and imperial dinnerware, snuff boxes, cigarette case and various impressive odds and ends of the imperial family. Audio guide rental at 150 rubles is highly recommended for if one wishes to spend a few hours listening to the description of each piece, although I would suppose that the majority of the visitors come to see the eggs, of which there is one less that the Kremlin museums collection in Moscow. However I would hazard a guess that the Kremlin collection, as I recall, is of the more ornate eggs."

The museum isn't huge and you are not allowed to take photos but there are a fair number of exhibits. Until 1800 hours it is tours only but after you can be independant and explore in your own time. Given it is often open till 2100 it is nice to do before a meal out for instance. The level of detail in the exhibits is incredible so get up close and if you need glasses don't be vain and put them on to fully appreciate the amazing close up details ;)"

Before going, I didn't know that they all came with surprises inside (like a flower or another egg). The surprises are on display too. There's an audio tour that tells the history of each Egg - who commissioned it, who received it as a gift and of course details about its design.TIPS: 1. They are open late (until 8:45pm), after other top attractions close. So, plan to go here last. 2. You can easily see the Eggs in 30-45 minutes with the audio tour. The rest of the collection is other works by Faberge like cigarette cases. Allow 1-2 hours to really see these items or just 30 minutes to check out this section out quickly, which is what we did.3. The gift shop has a very nice collection of souvenir Faberge Egg pendants with surprises inside. About US$25. I bought one for myself (love it and get compliments) and wish I would have also got a few as gifts."

(Visit before 6:00 PM and you're either part of a tour with a museum-provided guide in Russian only or your private guide must have a special license to guide there. After 6:00 PM, you're able to rent an English-language (or whatever language) audio guide for the eggs and go at your own pace. The room at the top of the stairs displays the fourteen eggs that are the centerpiece of the collection. (Only the Kremlin Armory has a larger collection.) The explanation for each egg is nice: enough technique detail so visitors can appreciate the artistry and enough history so we also understand the special story of each egg. If you want more detail, there are additional audio guide numbers you can play. There is also a guide number that starts an audio guide description of each room. Under normal circumstances, the palace is so beautiful, people would visit even if the rooms were empty! Ornate rooms filled with Faberge's beautiful work is almost too much for the eye to absorb.The central egg room is surrounded by at least eight other rooms filled with cases of Faberge frames, cigarette cases, desk clocks, and more. The display is organized by color to help make sense of the huge collection. There is no audio guide narration for these items -- or at least -- we never could figure out the numbering system. However, we carried around a book, on loan from the museum during our visit, that did identify every single object in the collection. This included some limited details but the materials, technique, and date are always provided.Note: Like many Russian destination in old buildings with old floors, you'll be required to put paper booties over your regular shoes. My husband wears American size 11 shoes and he was wearing bulky walking shoes so there were times when he had to struggle to fit the bootie over his shoes. I don't know if those bootie-required museums keep a few super-sized shoe covers on hand or let people visit in their socks."

The collection includes the very first Egg and the last Egg and the last Coronation Egg (Nicholas II). What I didn't expect was how beautifully they would be displayed. After visiting the Armory Chamber and seeing how poorly lit and cramped their Imperial Eggs were my expectations were not high. Different story here. Each egg has its own clear case so you can see all 4 sides. And the lighting is LED which heightens the experience. Also in the museum are beautiful collections of cigarette cases, snuff boxes, clocks, furniture, wine and punch bowl sets, etc. It goes on and on. What you will not see is anything plain. Everything is embellished almost beyond belief. Even the thermometer had jewels on it! The rooms themselves are something to see. Designed along the lines of Catherine's Palace and Peterhof Palace, only smaller dimensions, nothing is ignored. If you are on a cruise (as we were) and they offer a tour here (ours was $50) I would say you could do it on your own ($5) as we did. As long as you can get there. The location is 1 block off of Nevsky Prospect and a couple of blocks past the giant shopping mall Gostinny Dvor. The museum is on the Fontanka Canal. It is a central location. They give 1 English tour a day but other tours are in Russian. We hooked up with a Russian tour and used the Audio-guide which 2 people can share. It was not a problem. You cannot walk through the museum without a tour before 6PM. At that time you can enter and walk around freely. Go online and reserve tickets in advance because they are limited. There are free lockers to check coats and bags. The museum has only been open less than 2 years so it has not gotten the publicity of more established attractions. But don't be fooled if you have not heard of it. If you have the time put this very high on your list. DO NOT MISS THIS."

The Faberge house was responsible for a huge range of jewellery, trinkets, gold and silversmithing.

I was not expecting anything magnificent but I was simply BLOWN AWAY. The craftsmanship, the exquisite details, the artistry. You have to remind yourself that these eggs were made in the XIX \u2013 beginning of XX century, which pretty much puts to shame all the jewellery houses of the modern age, which gave up, it seems, on doing anything so exquisite and beautiful. Simply sunning. None of the photos I took could make the eggs justice. You have to see them.I recommend the audio guide, which offers quite a detailed commentary about each of the eggs and other objects currently on show in the museum.The museum is located in the Shuvalov Palace, which in turn is also one of the most amazing houses in Saint Petersburg, restored to its former glory. For a long time visits to the museum were by private appointments only, so I urge you to go and see these breathtaking objects of art now they are open to public. I cannot wait to see them again!"

I expected to visit in the evening discounted hours. But SPB took us first thing in the morning when the Museum was practically empty.Bliss.The displays are exquisite. There is no other adjective. Or maybe there are too many adjectives- tending towards hyperbole and extreme fawning!So do fawn on those decadent eggs while you are there. And on all the other trifles that spelt wealth and position in earlier times in Europe.The only cloud on all the bejewelled linings were the KGB style guards everywhere. Decidedly a throw back to Soviet times.One general tip for all Museums in Russia- dont carry big bags or coats so you avoid wasting time in cloakroom queues. We were a large family group of 14 and this save4d a lot of valuable time.And another- a guide is invaluable. But if you have read up on things apriori- savour your deeper knowledge without raining on the hardworking guides parade!'

There are times when it it possible to visit the museum and tour around yourself (some evenings from memory).

Also, while photography is not allowed inside the museum (that is fine, it is their right) there was discrimination inside the exhibition space. There was a tourist in shorts who was getting photographs in the presence of an employee. In fact, it seemed that the employee was accompanying the tourist while he was getting pictures!

The english speaking ones run twice daily 12.15 and 16.15, (ish)Just opposite the museum is an English speaking boat tour that leaves at 5.00 pm, and takes 90 mins.

It's more than just the famous Easter eggs that Faberge created for royalty, there are wonderful pieces that reflect the ostentatiousness and quirky personalities of their once wealthy owners. For a man who hates museums, my partner thought this was the best museum he has ever been to.We booked our tickets online a week before for the English tour and I thought it was worth it because the guide points out the intricacies of each item that you may not have noticed.They don't let you take any photos in the exhibit but lockers in the cloakroom are clean and safe. They also require you to put on overshoes which are handed to you in the cloakroom which makes it feel like a hospital trip but an amusing fashion statement."

This private (aka expensive) museum is still worth visiting. Our guidebook had it all wrong - so I highly recommend checking their website for the newest directions. At the time we went - as English speakers - we had several choices. There were 2 guided English tours - one at 12:15, another at 4:15 - the down side - they were limited to an hour - and sold out. During the day you can't visit the museum by yourself - so day time - that's your option. If you want to squeeze into a sold out tour - they will let you - for double the normal cost. Not a good idea.Much better option - go after 6:15 - they charge 450 rubles - and you get your own audioguide. You can take as long as you want to stare at the glorious eggs, silver services, and other do-dads - we took about 1.5 hours - and loved, loved, loved it. No crowds, no peeking over other heads. Just us the gems.You will be a much happier camper. Trust me on this!"

There are also several paintings from the period on display. Some of these were notable for being exhibited in a manner that I had not seen before, such that they appeared illuminated from behind; unique and attractive. We had a tour guide that spoke excellent English and had encyclopediac knowledge of the principal items. I have seen a traveling Faberge exhibit come to Montreal not long ago; this museum had more items than that exhibit."

Yes you do hage to leave a deposit but you get it back at the end. The audio guide is comprehensive and if you listened to every commentary you would probably be there 3-4 hours. I tended to go and find out the numbers of the descriptions and then go and sit on a bench out by the staircase to listen to it, but then i was knackered after 9-10 hours on my feet!The eggs are amazing, but also there are some paintings, and the gifts from the early 20th century are stunning as well. I am not one for icons but the icon room was actually impressive.Easy to find, just down from the bridge with 4 horses parallel to the river, large banners outside making it visible from the bridge.Nice gift shop, toilets only on ground floor, and you have to wear shoe covers in the main museum area."

Faberge himself used techniques that others have tried to replicate in our modern world and have failed.The other treasures are equally worth viewing, a visual feast of vibrant colour, gems and textures. It's a fairly small museum, easily managed in a couple of hours - and don't be surprised by the size of the men guarding some of the rooms!There's a good shop where you can indulge your Faberge dreams at a more modest price.

These have to be booked on-line in advance - you cannot buy an advance ticket at the cash desk (I tried!). The tours last an hour, and there are only one or two each day in English."

The palace they are in is beautiful to behold, and the number of other exhibits on show is mind boggling - OK, it does get repetitive, but it gives you a wonderful flavour of this unique company's creations. You don't have to look at everything, just browse and admire the workmanship. The icons room is particularly breathtaking.Ah, but the eggs - so wonderfully presented, you really can squish your nose up against the glass cases and look at every detail. The English audio guide was excellent, just the right amount of detail and some poignant stories. My teenage daughters loved it, too.Tried a number of times to book tickets ahead of time on the website but I never received the promised code by email that you need to complete the transaction. I was worried we would not get in, but actually it worked out for the best. Arrived on the day and just bought tickets for the evening (cheaper than advance booking online), which means we didn't have to go on a tour. So much better, as English tours are limited. I would highly recommend going it alone at your own pace with the audio guide.All in all, one of the jaw dropping highlights of a trip to a city in which my jaw was almost permanently on the floor."

I got the audio guide for an extra 150rubles which I found very useful. Take note that you need to pay a 2000ru refundable depositI for the audio guide. I didn't get the catalogue book that documents every item in the museum (which is free but requires a refundable deposit) so can't comment on its usefulness.The staff here were by far the best I have experienced in St Petersburg. They all had helpful attitudes, from front desk to the gallery staff, and just wanted visitors to get the most out of their visit.Highly recommended.

There's not much to do besides be impressed by the tiny little details but I found myself getting bored quite quickly and moving on."

The building is a restored wonder, and The Hermitage Museum could learn a lot from this restoration. As just one example, the window frames are sealed and painted, not cracked, warped and peeling. All the painting and moldings in the building were beautifully presented, along with appropriate furnishings in each room. The restroom and waiting areas were nicely appointed, and it was no hardship to wait for the tour to begin.The tour we joined was for Russian speakers, but we did have the English audio and that helped. The collection of eggs was truly amazing, along with a totally unexpected collection of fabulous paintings, that were only illuminated for as long as the group was in the room, perhaps a total of 3 or 4 minutes. As we left the room, the trailing guard turned off the light, leaving the collection in total darkness. Someone obviously knows the value of this collection and has given it the highest forms of protection with its conservation in mind. Kudos to whoever OK'd the spending of the money for adequate staff and renovation, it was worth it.The only thing I could fault is that there is no book or information available on the fabulous paintings and their painters. When I asked about it at the information desk, the lady seemed quite puzzled as to what I wanted. She referred me to the cashier (who spoke better English) and who was quite indifferent to my request. Pity, as I'll bet I'm not the only person who would like more information about the collection and its building. The Museum is missing an opportunity to educate the masses (and enrich themselves at the same time.) If they spent some money putting together the information I bet they'd see a return on their money almost immediately. However, the gift shop was one of the best we'd found after spending 10 days in St. Petersburg, with a lovely collection of Faberge egg pendants for sale. They had a display of very rare artistic egg pendants (that were far more pricey than the usual pendants) and I'm still kicking myself for not buying a couple of them. A first rate experience, and I highly recommend a visit (or two) to The Faberge Museum."

During my previous visit back in June, one had to join a group tour in order to view the Faberge treasures housed in the beautifully restored Shuvalov Palace, however, this has since changed. You can now visit the museum independently, but only after 6 pm! The Faberge Museum is open daily (except Fridays) from 10:00 am to 8:45 pm. The ticket office is open from 9:30 am to 8:15 pm. Admission is 300 Rubles - a bargain! Guided tours are offered from 10:00 am to 4:50 pm in both Russian or English. Duration of the guided tour is about one hour. Individual visitors are admitted from 6:00 pm to 8:45 pm. Hand held audio guides in various languages (including English) are available to rent. I was delighted to have had the opportunity to purchase a ticket and spend a couple of hours browsing the numerous display cases filled with Faberge treasures at my leisure. I would also like to note that the museum also has a gift shop on the ground floor, which offers a selection of souvenirs and books. The shop offers a 170-page Exhibit Index, which I do recommend to those visiting the museum independently. The price is only 150 Rubles.This museum is undoubtedly one of the city's finest museums. It is centrally located and easy to find, being situated on the Fontanka Canal just off Nevsky Prospect."

It is worth the trouble to find it[it's in Centre] and the structured tours; you need not wait for the English language one [not so good anyway] and worth a repeat just to linger over the \"eggs\" and other indescribably beautiful pieces. No one elsewhere at any time has done what the Faberge enterprise did in its heyday. What you miss being here [since it's not] you can pick up on at the Armory Museum in the Kremlin in Moscow. We visited the Faberge a day midweek in mid-autumn and there was a total of just nine in our group. The security folks were OK with us lingering a bit behind the tour [all Russian, except for us]. When we left the Museum we proceeded immediately to the \"House of Books\" [Dom Knigi] close by on Nevsky Prospek] and purchased several books on the Faberge house - and were primed for the \"eggs\" and other pieces we saw at the Armory in Moscow. Do not -- Do NOT miss -- the Faberge! As we were leaving I felt like Howard Carter -- \"I [have] see[n] the most beautiful things....\""

There were only 3 Russians in the group with the two of us and we had time to listen to the audio and examine the Faberge at leisure. The staff were extremely helpful and even the restrooms were well worth a visit.

Truly a superb exhibition of Faberge eggs and ornaments. It is heartening that Russia has at last been able to acquire these 'lost' eggs and put them on display in such beautiful surroundings. It is essential that you join a tour (for security reasons) so it's best to inquire ahead of time to make sure your tour leader speaks your language. It takes about 1-1/2 hours and is well worth seeing. No photographs are allowed but inexpensive books are available and a very good gift shop sells quality imitation items that are much better than the gee-gaw ones available anywhere else - evidently they are made specially for the Museum. The location of the Museum is right beside one of the canals and is close to Nevsky Prospekt."

It was not so long ago that a visit to St Petersburg, where Gustav Faberg\u00e9 established his business in 1842, was virtually devoid of anything related to Faberg\u00e9. However, that has recentlyl altered. In 2004 Victor Vekselberg purchased what remained of the Forbes Magazine Collection of Faberg\u00e9. It is rumoured that he paid just over US$100 million for what included nine Imperial Eggs. He added more Faberg\u00e9 as well as Russian decorative art and Russian art. Housed in the restored Shuvalov Palace, this is the best collection of Faberg\u00e9 on permanent display anywhere in the world. If you visit St Petersburg, you simply have to visit here. The Museum opened in 2013 and for a period access was not easy. Indeed, enthusiasts were paying up to Eur 200 to visit. However, booking is now much easier and cheaper. The Eggs (including the Duchess of Marlborough Egg, Resurrection Egg and the two Kelch Eggs - the Hen and the Chanticleer - as well as the Spring Flowers Egg - upon which experts are divided) are displayed in a large room. Another is entirely devoted to Faberg\u00e9. The result is stunning, if not overwhelming. Indeed, I visited with experts from the world's leading auction houses and one muttered, 'It's all too much!'. The second largest permanent display of Faberg\u00e9 is at Houston, Texas. Visit, enjoy and be dazzled."

It seemed a bit silly, but that was their rule. Despite this, we still learned a lot and saw an amazing collection of Faberge eggs. Interestingly, these trinkets of the wealthy noblemen and royalty were given most often as gifts to commemorate special occasions. They often had a special feature, like a pop up bird that sings inside, or a built in clock. We had no idea the depth of craftsmanship that went into these eggs. Faberge legacy, like the end of the collection of art and the building of churches, all came to a grinding halt in 1917, Bolshevik Revolution. Fortunately, many collectors held onto these amazing pieces, and the collection that is found in St Petersburg is really worth seeing."

I'm no fan of fancy jewellery etc. but the eggs are pretty impressive and beautifully presented in glass cases with a 360 degree view.The museum also has a collection of plates - meh - and cigarette cases, and other gifts also made by Faberge, which are pretty good.There are also a few decent paintings to look at.Worth the price of entry even if you're not a big fan. It's quite small so you'll be in and out in an hour or so. Go after 6pm when you can get a ticket without a mandatory tour and it's less crowded."

There are no words that can describe the feeling of standing with your nose about 50cm away from the most famous egg of all time - the coronation gold Faberg\u00e9 egg. Just mind blowing. There is also a beautiful collection of silver ornaments and pictures of the tsars and tsarinas. You have to wear slip on little cloth boots over your shoes to avoid making any mess with shoes - so it does feel a bit luxurious compared to other places in St. Petersburg but having said that - the toilet signs were hilarious. Ladies - an outline of a woman in a ball gown. Gents - a figure wearing a tuxedo and a bow tie. We stumbled upon this place by accident whilst looking for a canal boat tour and it was a great find! Definitely the place to be if you have a good eye for details as each item is so intricate that you could stare at it for hours wondering just how they did it before laser cutters were invented :) An eloquent prayer to the gifted craftsmen behind these works of art."

The eggs were beautiful and the audio guide explaining them was excellent. They do ask for a 4,000 ruble deposit to use the audio guide. We didn't have it but they took a $100 bill as a deposit. Got it back no problem. In addition to the eggs, there are other wonderful displays including Russian Silver, gifts from the tsar made by faberge, enamels, porcelain, paintings etc. The palace itself is worth the price of admission.

This private museum centered in the center of St. Petersburg Russia is lip octaves at the opulent palace of Count Shualov. Most famously known for his creation of delicate jeweled eggs, Faberge oversaw and created approximately 50 eggs for Russian tsars Alexander III and Nicolas II commissioned eggs for their wives and mothers as Easter gifts.43 survived, 9 were collected by Malcolm Forbes, the American publishing magnate, later to be sold by his estate are now held in St. Petersburg. This is the world's second largest collection of the imperial Easter eggs. Aside, you will use at least 1 1/2 hours to tour this place. You will spellbound by the details of this 19th and early 20th century arts....intricate silver dinner sets and unbelievable enamel works. Remember these were designed by high fashioned, exceedingly wealthy Russians. The setting, which has several flights of brilliant carved marble stairs surrounded by a gorgeous ataircase sits in a restored palace along the Fontanka River. I promise you will not be disappointed!"

This museum came about because a well-known oligarch was pressured into buying back a collection of Faberge eggs and open a museum for a public display of patriotism / Russia flexing its muscles. As a result, it's not a labour of love and it kinda shows, staff attitude is very dodgy and you get a sort of \"tick-the-box\" vibe in the place.

You will be assigned to a group with a guide who may or may not speak your language. If that is the case, you can go through when you want to, but you will need the AUDIO guide as this is a necessity; otherwise you get ushered through the place and miss all of the nuances. The array of eggs is amazing and the special little \"gifts\" inside are even more amazing. During your tour, the guide will \"pull\" you through the rooms at their pace and you may not get to see everything that you want to. As they usher you out of the rooms, the guards allow the next group in behind you. There is some time to go back, but we felt kind of rushed through the exhibits. There are some eggs in the Armory in Moscow, but nothing that compares to this museum. Even as a \"guy\", this was well worth the time and expense, so I highly recommend that you go here."

If you happen to be in St. Petersburg, Russia make sure to include a visit to the fabulous Faberg\u00e9 Museum. This wonderful museum is located in the beautifully restored Shuvalov Palace, where nine of the famous Faberg\u00e9 Easter Eggs are the central pieces of the exhibition. The first Easter Egg was commissioned in 1885 by Tsar Alexander III for his wife Maria Feodorovna. The tradition of gifting Easter Eggs spread among the members of the Romanov Dynasty, the rulers of the time, and other kingdoms in Europe. The last Easter Egg was commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II in 1917. The Tsar and his whole family were murdered the same year by the Russian Bolsheviks, who took over the power. The Bolsheviks collected most of the Faberg\u00e9 eggs, decorative pieces and jewellery available in Russia and sold them throughout the world because they didn\u2019t fit their ideology.The St. Petersburg Faberg\u00e9 shop produced 65 eggs. It is believed that there are only 57 eggs known to be in existence. Nine of these eggs were part of the Forbes Magazine collection until 2004, when they were bought by Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire, just before they were going to be auctioned. These nine Easter Eggs are now the most important pieces at the fabulous Faberg\u00e9 Museum, being the largest Faberg\u00e9 Easter Egg collection under one roof. The museum has 12 display rooms with 4000 exhibits and more then 1000 pieces from the Faberg\u00e9 jewellery shop. The Shuvalov Palace is the perfect home for these beautiful eggs, as hey are an important part of St. Petersburg\u2019s history. Their return home bring back happiness and pride to the Russian people."

How magnificently they are displayed here. In glass display cabinets with 360 degree vision. Also in a restored Palace. We did not find it a problem to buy tickets at 6 pm for individuals. There were far fewer people in the museum so we really got to see everything at close quarters. Visitors do need to know the deposit for the audio sets is 2000 rubles, per set, in cash. The hire cost of the equipment is reasonable and the entry fee is perfectly acceptable. There did not appear to be guide books for sale prior to the visit, which would have been helpful. However, the building has been refurbished to a very high standard and the Eggs and the other exhibits are priceless. Each egg is unique, of course, but very many other exhibits are tremendous in their own right. There are many miniature eggs, enamelled and jewelled photograph frames, snuff boxes, clocks, travel items, and much, much more. The museum is near the boat trip station on the Fontanka near the Anichkov Bridge (with the 4 horses) on Nevsky Prospect so not difficult to locate. Our Hotel Concierge gave us full details. I my opinion this is now a MUST see in St Petersburg. In fact, maybe the top MUST SEE!"

There are English-tours but the museum doesn't seem to have a decent system for alerting the tourist about when they are. The website didn't state the English-tour times; there are no audio guides in English yet; and some tourists arrived with us and were turned away, even though that morning the museum had told them to come back at that time. We decided to tag along with the Russian tour even though we didn't speak a word. The very nice and informed tour guide broke into English at the end to give us some information. There are some good English interpretative signs as well. We just loved this visit!! We wouldn't bring children. It is very much a \"don't touch\" place."

Having read previous reports of the English tour not always happening (we were offered 2.30) even if they say it will we took the first Russian tour (11.30). Although the museum opens at 11 pre booked guided tours may be before you. Stunning collections, layout, lighting-. Bright rooms you did not have to stand looking at one exhibit and could move freely around each room. Although in Russian the Guide did not spend too long on each item so it was not tedious as you could look at the other exhibits. The Guide was quite happy to answer the odd question in English and several Russians also told us about things. No photography. Should have a guide book produced but maybe that will come soon. I would go back again - well worth a fiver (5 Uk pound approx)"

            "review": "Worth the effort for me. This is a private collection, as opposed to a museum run by the state or a company, which might explain why visiting it is not as straightforward as it might be.We arrived at about 10.10 and joined a small queue waiting for the opening time of 10.30. Once inside, we went to the ticket office where we were told the time of the English tour. I was expecting this to be 7pm from what I'd read on the forum, but it was actually 3.30. This was a Saturday, so maybe it varies depending on which day of the week it is; or maybe they just decide on the day - there seems to be no way of finding out in advance. You are asked to arrive 10 minutes early, so you can put covers on your shoes. There is no refund if you buy a ticket and don't turn up. No photos or videos are allowed.Faberge made 50 eggs for the Imperial royal family, and 11 similar eggs for wealthy individuals. This museum has 12 eggs (the largest collection in the world) including 9 Imperial eggs (only the Kremlin has more, with 10). There are quite a few other objects which were originally owned by the Forbes family, many of which were made by Faberge, and show extraordinary work with enamel and gold. There are also some paintings, including a Renoir, and the building itself is pretty impressive.I would not describe this as a \"must see\". But I've always been fascinated by the Faberge eggs, so it was definitely worth it for me."

            "review": "A new kid on the cultural block. The recently opened Faberg\u00e9 Museum has nine imperial Easter eggs and much, much more. Housed in an impeccably restored town mansion, the exhibits comprise several hundred examples of Russian jewellery and silverware, each object more exquisite than the last. We were lucky in our tour guide (booked via our hotel). She was well briefed on the collection and lectured in clear and idiomatic English. The displays are at the cutting edge of museology and no expense appears to have been spared to make a wonderful collection accessible and interesting. Just one word of caution: the museum guide book has not yet been published and the museum shop does not yet even stock postcards of the eggs! There are fridge magnets and copies of the eggs though. These copies were on on sale at 30-40% cheaper than in commercial outlets but you will need to pay in cash since the shop is not yet geared up to accept credit cards"

            "review": "a shambles. Although repeatedly excused to us because the museum 'is newly opened' this place really needs to get its act together. Although in theory there are English language tours on offer, the monoglot ticket office is usually unable to tell you when they are so you can't book them. Taking a Russian tour as non-Russian speakers we were told not to go ahead of the guide so walked through a 90 minute incomprehensible commentary past unlabelled exhibits. There are some very lovely things and also some exquisitely ugly but beautifully crafted items where form and function have lost any connection."

            "review": "Fantastic museum, but let down by the administration. I recently visited St Petersburg for a long week end (April) and loving Faberge\u2019, I put in my schedule the recently open dedicated Faberge\u2019 Museum.I would like to give 2 different ratings: one high rating for the museum and its treasures but a very low for its management.Placed in the Shuvalov Palace, 21 Naberezhenaya Street, the Faberge\u2019 Museum looks over the Fontanka river and it is easy to find.A notice on the entrance door advises that the ticket office opens at 10.30am with strictly guided tours (max 15 people each) starting at 11am until 7.00pm. There are only few days a week open for visits: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays.From my Internet researches I was aware of a limited number of English speaking tours and that it is not possible to purchase advance tickets. So due to my short time spent in the city, I thought that a ticket for a Russian speaking tour would have been my only choice.No indication of other particular access requirements were indicated in the notice.Once open, people were met by a sort of check point where a lady had the function of deciding who was allowed to purchase a ticket and who was not.I soon discovered that only Russian people were allowed to visit the museum on that day. Everyone non-Russian was categorically refused entrance.I explained that unfortunately I had that day only, being in St Petersburg for a short time (like other tourists in the queue) and that I would have liked to take a Russian tour anyway, still thinking that it was only a matter of language choice.However the museum attendant absolutely and categorically refused admission because I was not Russian.Only after several minutes and discussions, she took out a folder and said that there was a tour for \u201cEnglish\u201d (meaning \u2018rest of the world\u2019) the following day at 7pm.Me and the other \u2018rest of the world\u2019 explained that unfortunately it was not possible. Some had to leave the same day, some just could not make it and asked politely if it was possible to have a ticket. Even a nice Russian lady in the queue tried to help me with no results, looking a bit embarrassed herself.During this time the attendant kept completely ignoring us and went on speaking in Russian granting access to the local people only.A nice foreign family that was next to me tried everything to explain that they were leaving the same afternoon, that their hotel phoned the previous day and were advised by the museum staff to be there the following morning at the opening time, but the only answer was a clear hostile refusal.At this point this lady started to complain that the \u201cEnglish\u201d take photos and use mobiles when it was clearly forbidden. We eventually understood that the \u201cEnglish-rest of the world\u201d were not accepted for the reason that we all were disrespectful of the museum\u2019s rules.She went on complaining about it without listening us assuring that we would have not taken any photos or used phones. At this point I personally felt really discriminated and even insulted as I was pictured as the stereotype careless tourist.When she finally felt reassured by our promises of respecting the museum rules, she decided that we could entered for the 12pm tour. I grabbed the chance and took a place, before she changed her mind. Unfortunately for the nice family next to me the imposed time, was not possible and sadly had to leave.I bought the ticket and left.I finally managed to start the tour with a mix group of Russians and foreigners. The tour starts from 2 rooms showing over 100s of pieces of Russian silverware fantastically carved dated from the 18th and 19th century. The tour than goes to the main room where the famous Faberge\u2019 eggs are displayed. It was a real treat: Lilies of the Valley Egg, the Coronation Egg, the Bay Tree Egg, the Fifteenth Anniversary Egg, the Renaissance Egg to name only a few. There are 9 major/more refined eggs plus some more \u2018simple\u2019 looking but very beautiful none the less. The guide spends times to explain every single one of the Faberge\u2019 eggs leaving enough time to closely observe them in their fantastic details and glory.The following rooms hold 100s of pieces of Faberge\u2019 jewellery items, from clocks, picture frames, tobacco boxes, vanity cases, miniatures jewellery in the form of animals, every day utensils in gold, precious stones or rock crystal (like miniature hot water Russian style boilers/kettle), jade letters openers, stationary items and much more. There is even Faberge\u2019 thermometer with a gold deep blue enamel top/cap.The exhibition finishes with 3 rooms with paintings related to important events in the Russian history and a display of religious Russian silver icons and objects beautifully carved and detailed.The guided tour lasts 1h30-40 minutes.For the Faberge\u2019 fans, this museum is not to be missed. Just Google images of the museum in St Petersburg and you will see official public photos of some of the items displayed and the rooms.The Palace itself is beautiful making a fantastic frame to the collection.However the management of the museum should understand that non Russians tourists should be given an easier and more frequent access.According to my experience with that particular lady, it is my strong feeling that the (low) availability of English speaking tours is not done to help foreigners to understand the explanations, but rather to limit the access to anyone that is non-Russian.To be proud of being part of a great country and its art is understandable. For this reason a more flexible and polite approach should be adopted in making visits more available to anyone (internationally speaking) who love and appreciate such magnificent works of art by Faberge\u2019.Every country in the world have both respectful and rude citizens. However to be blindly discriminated and categorised as an English/rest-of-the-world-disrespectful person is hardly acceptable.The museum at the moment does not have a website and there is no way to know well in advance when an English speaking tour is scheduled. They just say to turn up on the day when they open (as I did) and try your luck.I am aware that some travel agencies have special arrangements therefore if travelling through a specialised operator, it is worth to ask if they can book a visit. While there I noticed a small private group accompanied by a local English speaking guide.Independent travellers could try with a local operator if they want to avoid any surprise.For people who stay in town for more than 2/3 days, they could go to the museum when they open and check for the English guided tours available but no advance booking is possible.The entrance is RUB300 but an agency would charge a lot more.The Faberge\u2019 Museum administration has the freedom to apply any policy of their choice on who, when and how to admit visitors. However in order to avoid misunderstandings and upset people, an official international website should be opened, clearly explaining all the relevant admission information and timetable for a smooth, joyful, trouble free visit."
