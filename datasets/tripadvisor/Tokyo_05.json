This is an outstanding transport system, the best that i have exopeinced anywhere in the world!We had a JR Pass, but bought a 72 hour pass to use the metro and subway lines and as a visitor, was best utilised with a transport \"app\" - i used the city rail app, which was excellent, and allowed me to confidently navigate around the city. The trains themselves all had destination and current location advice. No train that we travelled on was dirty. There was no grafitti. No violence. No drunkedness. No bad behaviour. Awesome. Australians public transport managers need to learn from the japanese!"

All the metro lines are color coded with a station number, so long as you know the train line you need to get on and the station number you would be fine. With some very large stations, make sure you get the correct exit number, otherwise, it could be a very long walk. If you need any assistance at the station, there are plenty of people who are willing to go out of their way to help despite the language barrier. Just make sure you have the metro map handy so you can point to people on the map."

There is more than one company. JR seems to be above ground, while the metro is underground. Each one seems to have its own ticket machine. Above the machines are maps, with station names and prices. Unlike NYC, each destination has a different price. Once you know the price, press the language button, and select English. Then choose the number of riders, and select the price. Pay, and then take the ticket. You need it to get to the train. If the ticket doesn't work then you bought the ticket for the wrong company... They'll give you the money back at the ticket office. Keep the ticket! You'll need it to get out of the station."

Carriages are clean, some are women only at certain times. Gets very busy during the rush hour. Always a friendly local to help you. All platforms have a station master, many speak English so if in doubt you can ask for help. A brilliant and efficient way to get around Tokyo. Safe at night."

What us overwhelming at first about the metro system is its enormity. It crosses rail lines, reaches into other cities and prefectures, and there is a mass of humanity passing through during peak hours. But it is safe, clean, and the tickets run 170 yen to 240 close in, and 980 yen if you are traveling 60-70 minutes away. Most cars have digital signage and announcements of next stop in Japanese and English, so you can't really get lost. Notice the yellow rubber tracks that are imbedded in the tile. That is to guide the seeing impaired. Another proof of the dignity and independence extended to all in this culture."

There are far too many platforms in larger stations.Well, limited mobile phone usage inside the metro cabinet which is very good.People are often quite polite and well mannered inside the cabinet as well!I don't think that Metro fares are cheap."

Luckily, if you can read English you can definitely find out where you need to go with ease.

There are trains running to almost any destination you want. A Pasmo or Suica card will make your travels much easier if you will be using the system a lot. Just load your card and you are ready to swipe in and out like a pro. But be warned, the system can be confusing, here's why: 1. You pay for each leg traveled, so it can cost a lot more than you realize.2. Some times of the day and some particular stations can be really busy. so expect to be squeezed right up against another passenger with nothing to hang onto.3. A lot of Japanese have mastered the art of standing and sleeping on the trains. It's amazing how every person on the morning train has their eyes closed.4. The larger stations like Shinjuku or Tokyo can be confusing to exit or change trains. You need to follow the signs above or on the floor. But sometimes they disappear and you are left to your own defenses. There are up to 20 or more exits from certain stations.5. Tourist attractions are not listed on the exits. You need to know where you are going and googlemap it to find the correct exit.6.Late at night, certain platforms close and you are directed to use a different one. Unfortunately the announcements are in Japanese. We followed the direction for the destination we wanted but after 3 trains on an opposing platform came and nothing came on ours we knew something was wrong. We switched to the other platform and even though the sign said it was going somewhere else, we got to our destination.7. Stations connected to shopping malls become even more confusing. Expect to walk along way before you get to your next connection or destination. They can be deceiving. It might be better to exit to the street and walk directly there.8. A one day pass is for One Day, not 24 hours. Don't buy one at 6:00 PM and expect it to still work tomorrow morning.9. Connecting to a JR line will cost you more."

Your J R Rail Pass will get you around, and once that expires get a PASMO CARD - charge it with 1000 to 2000 yen and you are set. Any spare yen on your PASMO CARD can be redeemed at the major stations, with Shibuya and Shinjuku stations the ones we most frequented. The subway system is complex, has lots of lines, so a map of the subway system is necessary, and available free at most stations and Tourist Information Centers. Given my dyslexia getting around required a little focus, pre-trip research, but I also found that station staff were generally very happy to help with directions. The other thing I quite liked about the subway was the great posters used by the local authorities to warn against drunkenness, selfie sticks, all manner of stuff, and the advertisement within the carriages. Commuters on the subway are quiet, polite, don't chat on their mobile phones - in fact as subway around the world go the Tokyo Metro is ace - convenient, clean, and very cost effective."

However, it does not run 24 hours a day. While through service with other companies complicates this somewhat, the last train generally starts at midnight and completes its service by 01:00, and the first train generally starts at 05:00.A good high-speed connection to and from the Narita Airport is the Keisei Skyliner which runs to Ueno or Nippori Metro Stations. A ticket for the fast and comfortable Skyliner limited express, connecting Narita Airport to the heart of Tokyo in as little as 36 minutes, and the \"Tokyo Subway Ticket\", which allows users to freely ride any Tokyo subway line for 24, 48 or 72 hours, can be purchased online at a specially low priced set and picked up at the Narita Airport when you arrive. Note: The Tokyo Subway Ticket does not work on the JR Lines. In addition, taking luggage on the subway during commute hours may be difficult due to the crowds of people.A good tip is to look at the vicinity map when you exit the gates. Look at where you are and where you want to go and identify the corresponding exit (i.e. A1,A2). Then follow the signs to that exit."

For JR you could use most of the train lines ones you couldn't use had no JR symbol, they were only busy in peak times but when it was peak times you will be pushed in however this ensures all passengers get to where they want to be on time. I think you can only buy JR pass from your country of origin.It is very rude to eat or drink on the train I read so we didn't do this and also never saw anyone doing this, I think it is also rude to talk so there was very limited speech of anyone, when we whispered we were looked at like we just started dancing however if you look different to the Japanese people they find us interesting anyway.

On JR lines the IC cards can be used too. It doesn't matter which IC card you use: PASMO or SUICA.To enter/leave the tracks you just swipe your IC card over the area that is marked with \"IC\" at the gates. They are normally open but close immediately if something went wrong during the reading of the IC card. The fare is calculated depending on the distance of your trip.Tokyo Metro itself is fast, clean and trains run frequently. Be prepared of crowded trains during rush hour. So don't travel with heavy and large luggage during rush hour.Stations are announced automatically in English too and it tells you in advance on which side doors will open at the next station. There are also monitors indicating the next station as well as an overview of all stations (always switching between Japanese and Latin characters).To calculate a route I would recommend using Google Maps as it seems to know all timetables and fares."

Tokyo USD to larger to walk everywhere but there public transportation system is well maintained and can get you anywhere. Prices are higher than in the new York or London metro system but not unreasonable. This is an odd system in that there lines address not run by one central authority but rather multiple companies so that transfer can be difficult requiring several hundred yard walls and moving in and out of security areas. Two lines may run through the same area but may need in completely different buildings. There's address many lines so there subway map can be confusing. We found apps which claim to tell you how to get from one place to another inconsistent and sometimes outright wrong. So travel takes some g and willingness to ask questions which can new difficult if you do not speak Japanese. There are many who speak some English but translation s can be complicated again even when using languages apps. Despite these frustrations the system is good. Dinner of the station's offer fabulous on the go food and great architecture so a tour of them is itself interesting. One of the passes like the suica pass is useful. you put money on it and are billed as you go and just tap the turnstile to move through as most residents do.

Don't even fart around with tickets or day passes, buy the PASMO card and be done with it. 500 yen deposit and then throw 2000-3000 on the thing, don't waste your time any other way.Shockingly, the system is not as nice as I expected it to be.With multiple companies running multiple lines, it is very easy to get confused and difficult to figure out your way. Your map may not have all the stations listed on it, and you may need to leave your station, walk outside and across the street to get to the same station for a different line. I was in Tokyo for three days and was only just understanding how it all worked. Tokyo station, is absolutely insane!! Some of the stations, while clean, are showing their age and can use some TLC. Oh, and it is expensive compared to other metro's in the world, I spent more than I intended just bouncing around Tokyo for a few days.Shanghai metro I understood in a few minutes, London a few minutes, Toronto a few minutes, the only people who think the Tokyo system is easy and the locals and tourists who have been there for a few days/weeks. Hence if you use the PASMO card, you don't have to worry about making a mistake. All that being said, use the Metro, get a map, get an app, and use it. You will make mistakes, you will have to back track, you will make wrong turns, but there is no better way around Tokyo."

I wanted to write a short recommendation about the metro tokyo for travellers who will go to Tokyo but read that there are already so many reviews on this topic, then I will keep mine short. Generally speaking, the metro in Tokyo is the best way to visit the city. There are 2 companies, JR and M, and there are totally separated and you will have to purchase different tickets depending where you want to go to. I was in the Prince hotel Shinagawa and had to purchase a JR single ticket at 140 yens to go to the next station where the M metro is, and then use my daily M ticket (fare=1000 yens). Both metros are very clean and crowdy. It takes a bit of time to understand how it works, let's say a couple of hours, and when you are familiar with it, you like it very much as it allows to go and visit conveniently any nice place in Tokyo."

I'd just recommend to travelers to know which exit to take! Once you get off the train, it's a bit disorientating to know which direction to leave - so find a map and walk towards the right exit - because the labyrinth of some of these metro stations could take you a few kilometres in the wrong direction! Particularly Shinjuku, Shibuya and Tokyo stations. I got lost a few times in train stations, gave up trying to find my exit and had some great food! There are hundreds, if not thousands of underground restaurants in Tokyo, and they're all delicious!"

            "review": "Efficient, but here are some tips!. I an't be the only person who finds it hilarious that the subway system is the #5 thing to do in Tokyo; you really don't have a choice in using it because it's the best way to get around! But here are some tips and insight I picked up during my recent (and first!) trip to Tokyo:-Tokyo has 2 separate subway companies. Yes, you read that right. It's not like in the States where it's one city-run system. In Japan, there's two, and they're completely separate: the first one is Japan Rail (abbreviated JR) that runs throughout the entire country, and the second is Tokyo Metro (their logo looks like a weird letter M) that runs only throughout Tokyo.-If you have the Japan Rail Pass, it ONLY works with JR lines. I got around fine with just the JR lines; they are plenty and run to most places in the city.-If you don't have the Japan Rail Pass, or have the pass and find a Tokyo Metro line to be more convenient, fares are surprisingly affordable, so have no fears!Purchasing tickets:-If you have the Japan Rail Pass, simply show your pass to the Gate Attendant either to the far left or right of the turnstiles/entry points. That's it!-Otherwise, you have to purchase a ticket from one of the automated machines. Everyone machine I've used has a button that says 'English' on it. Otherwise, just input your money, press the button that states the correct amount you want for your ticket (ex: press the 140 button if you want a ticket with a fare of 140 yen), and your change and ticket will be dispensed.-To find our your fare, you have to look at the map that's usually above the ticket machine. I found the map to be pretty tricky to understand, so here's a tip: use Google Maps! Most stations have free wifi you can use, so punch in where you want to go with Google Maps, find the train line and transfers you want to use, and Google Maps will display a 'fare' at the bottom of the page. They ALWAYS display the correct fare, surprisingly! -If you're paranoid like me, I recommend finding a wifi spot early in the day and looking up your routes and fares. Then, either screenshot or write down the lines and fares you want to use. That way, in case you're in a station that doesn't have wifi, you're plenty prepared!-I would suggest avoiding taking the subway between 8-9AM and 5-6PM. That is Tokyo rush hour, and things go BERSERK. Rush hour and spill over into 10AM and 7PM, but it won't be as bad as those key pre/post-work hours. If you get caught in rush hour, don't panic, it's not a horrible situation. But be prepared to get real close to strangers. There's also a problem in Japan of men groping women on packed trains, so please be weary of that if you're riding a train in rush hour. It's not common or prevalent by any means, but it is an issue, so please do watch out. Some trains have women-only cars to mitigate this problem if you're truly worried or encounter a strange situation.Some pointers of Japanese society I thought I'd share because I wasn't warned about them before I went:-Japanese society is very orderly. So orderly, that to properly board a train/subway, you must fine your train line on the floor of the platform (they're usually color-coordinated, so match the colored line with the color of your train), and line up behind it. You'll see others doing the same. This way, it's not a mad rush to board the train; people enter in a nice and orderly line! If there's a big crowd exiting the train onto your platform, the lines will usually move out of the way towards the side of the train doors (while still maintaining line order), and wait for everyone to disembark before embarking themselves. The orderliness will astound you.-If you're a \"foreigner,\" meaning not of Japanese decent and not speaking in Japanese, people WILL stare at you. It's not a matter of 'if they stare at me'. No. They will stare. My friend told me this was more prevalent in the countryside than in Tokyo, but no, Tokyo subway riders were pretty obvious about their staring as well. Don't think of it at rudeness; it's just a different culture who likes to stare I guess. There's no malice. I suppose they're just fascinated by foreigners. And they show their fascination by staring.-Another thing about subway riders: If you get a seat, and you're sitting next to a Japanese person, they will likely switch seats away from you. Not sure why, but it's happened enough for me to notice that the Japanese don't like sitting on the train next to foreigners. You can see it as a positive (more room!) or negative (how rude!), but how you take it is up to you; just take it as it is.-It's considered 'rude' to eat or drink while riding public transportation! You will rarely see someone drinking a soda or taking a bite of something on the train. My friend explained that it's to avoid possibly spilling someone on someone's nice business suit/dress, which makes sense. So beware of even more staring if you're consuming something on board!I hope this helps, and gives you a nice run down of what to expect on the subway system. Happy travels!"

It goes pretty much every in Tokyo and you are never more then 30 min away from your destination. The maps are easy to read and signs are very helpful in directing you. IF you get lost, ask one of the employees at any station, they usually speak good english and can tell you exactly where to go. We barely ever got lost and always managed to get where we want to go. Highly recommended form of transportation, don't even think about getting cabs as they are slower and extremely over priced. Only case to take a cab is if you are traveling with luggage and need to get to one of the Shinkansen (bullet train) stations to travel to other cities."

You can always expect the train to be clean and quiet (there's a sign to discourage making calls on hand phone while in the train). A suggestion here, if you don't take many rides in a day, I would suggest getting the normal PASMO card that locals use instead of the various day pass for tourists. Not that the day pass is not good, but you would need to take many rides in a single day to make it worthwhile, and it's normally restricted to certain lines."

Once you figure that out it becomes easier I finally found an app that worked quite well to navigate everything. The trains in Tokyo are extremely expensive as well you can easily spend $30+ a day if you are busy. The Suica cards make things easy on payment and can be used for other things as well. Don't expect to just jump in and look at the map on the train, if you prepare and get a good routing app you will probably be fine.Trains are clean but can be very crowded- get ready to be crushed into other people if you travel at peak times and don't expect to sit often."

The trick to riding, if you have to transfer lines is to learn which are the best stations to transfer at, since lines intersect at multiple stations. One could walk across a platform, or at worst, walk nearly a kilometer underground to transfer. Another hint. Look at the maps at the stations to decide which exit to go to ground level from. Otherwise, one could, again, be quite far from where one wants to be. Japanese people don't talk on cell phones, or eat, or drink on commuter trains. Let's keep it that way."

You can get a map with English station identifications. The most difficult thing I found was figuring out prices. So a Japanese friend suggested I buy a farecard. There is a Suica card and a Pasmo card. They both work on the subway. You buy them from machines. Look for one that takes cash if that's how you are paying, and look for the \"English\" button. Basically, you tell the machine that you need a new card, and put in money. I started with 1000 yen. They charge you a 500 yen deposit for the card and put the rest on the card for rides. Personally, I always end up with a pocket full of coins, as the smallest banknote is the equivalent of about US$ 9. So I go to a Pasmo machine, tell it I want to re-charge the card, dump my excess coins (except for 1 and 5 Yen coins, and the heavy coins are transformed into value on the card. The nice thing about the card is that it isn't only useful on the subway. You can use it to pay for things in the thousands of convenience stores you find everywhere.And speaking of everywhere, that's where the subways can take you. You may have to change trains, but the signs are there and easy to follow. One suggestion is to figure out from maps which exit you need -- some stations have 5 or more, and you want to pop out of the subway at the right place. In conclusion, you won't find a better way to get around Tokyo, although I will admit I don't use it during rush hours when they have \"pushers\" to stuff people in so the doors can close, but with that exception, go to it!"

Combined with the Toei Line, the metro system of Tokyo act as the veins of the city, transporting droves of people to all sorts of districts. It truly is an experience in itself.Trains are never late. Ever. And when they are, it's a big deal! The punctuality of the trains was entirely refreshing from the constantly late public transport we have in Scotland. A train is also close by when entering a station, so you never have to wait for long.In terms of prices, it is dirt cheap. Literally pennies to travel across the city. I'd recommend just using a single ticket if you're only travelling to a single destination that day. Pick up an all-day pass for either the Tokyo Metro, Toei Metro or both for \u00a5700 and \u00a51000 respectively if you plan on doing a lot of train-hopping on a specific day. You'll save some cash!The system seems very confusing on first glance \u2013 on our first visit the night before we travelled anywhere, it was completely overwhelming. This passes however, and you'll be a professional by the end of day 2. If you have an iPhone, make sure to download the Tokyo Metro guide app which shows you all connections required to get from point A to B as well as the price. It is invaluable when it comes to getting around! Even better, it works offline so for travellers without roaming data, it's all there without a connection."

We were surprised that quite a few of the rides were under $3 or less. We were in Tokyo between Christmas and New Years and the metro did not seem busy at all. At the busiest stations, there were uniformed workers making sure that people were able to get on and off the train without any problems. There was never any pushing or budging to get on or off the train. Also, the stops were in both Japanese and in English. The trains were very clean and we always felt safe.At some stations, there were some wonderful small restaurants in which we tried their sushi.

In most places throughout Tokyo, you're no more than a few hundred metres from a station, and trains run regularly, even at night and on weekends. With a pass (such as a 3-day subway pass), it's easy to get around, though for extended stays, a rechargeable smart card would be preferable. Once you work out how to transfer between lines or to non-subway lines, then you'll know not to try and exit through certain gates.However, with two young children (one in a stroller), it can be quite difficult to navigate the subway, particularly with making changes to other lines. Exiting can also be a big hassle, as many stations still have stairs, escalators only going one way, and either no lift or one far away from where you need to be. Doing some research on the station beforehand is therefore important, while keeping in mind that some inconvenience might still occur."

This is one of the best ways to get around Tokyo and there are two things that will make the experience more efficient and more fun.#1 is the Pasmo Subway Pass. I highly recommend purchasing this pre-loads subway at any one of the convenient Pasmo vending machines located in almost every station. You can pre-pay in several amounts, we chose the 1000 yen option (app. $10) and if you run out of credit you can recharge the card as well. Using this card is simple, you just scan on entrance and exit and the fare is deducted. It saves you purchasing tickets for each journey and will save you a ton of time. Pasmo can also be used for buses and some other minor purchases. At the end of your stay you can return the card and get back your 500 yen \"deposit\".#2 is the Tokyo Metro Subway app for your smartphone. This is a free app that you can use to plan your journey. Just enter the station you are starting at and your destination and the app will tell you the route including any transfers you must make, the time of the journey and the cost. This is an invaluable help as there are over 180 stations in the Tokyo Metro system and some journeys require 2 or 3 transfers.With these 2 tips you will master the subway experience and make all your underground trips quick and efficient!"

Search for Tokyo transport day pass Bic Camera. The latter is a department store found virtually near all major train/ metro stations.

As journeys on Suica Pasmo can cost up to 200/250 yen, these tickets are very convenient is you want to travel around a fair bit as you'd en up spending more using Suica/ PasmoYou can buy individual tickets for Yamanote line if you need to use it.Bic camera sells these tickets normally on the ground floor and you need to show your passport.The secret to navigating the huge stations is following signs closely and read the exit boards (some stations have tens and tens of exists) identifying where you have to go or a hotel or building or landmark close ti where you have to go.On the other hand, getting lost in the stations is kinda of fun.

            "review": "Appears daunting but is surprisingly easy and awesome!. First of all...if you are there more than just a day or so get a SUICA CARD. Load it up and swipe away. You can also use it to buy things at many stores...like a debit card. There is a good government site all about the metro with maps you can print out but I cannot provide the link in a review. Below I have some personal tips. The Metro is like a puzzle...you just need to look at each line individually vs. looking at all the bits at the same time. First of all, holding together all the pieces of the Tokyo puzzle is the: YAMANOTE LINE: This train line is the BEST! It is a circle. A loop that circles around central Tokyo connecting the main stations like Harajuku, Ueno, Tokyo, Shibuya, Shinagawa, etc. ...all the ones that you, as a tourist, will need usually. If you can...print out the metro map before you leave from the web site link above and then locate this line on the map first and hi-lite it. It will help you get your bearings. It\u2019s like getting the corners of the puzzle done first and locating all the \u2018like\u2019 colors\u2026it makes the puzzle easier to complete. You can get very close to almost any place you are going with this line and then either hoof it or connect to anther metro line easily (btw many of the stops are super close to one another and it might take less time to just walk it vs. changing lines. I often just get off at the YURAKUCHO stop on the Yamanote line to get to anywhere in Ginza vs. changing to get to a stop closer to where I am going ) If you are buying individual tickets vs. Suica card REMEMBER there is more than one company involved in the metro system. You HAVE to buy tickets at the kiosk that services the line you want to take. Most of the machines are in English and Japanese with little pictures. Just follow the prompts and it will tell you how much money is needed. And if you make a mistake, no worries. There is a guy at the exit of every station who will collect the extra fees needed. Last note! Avoid the metro at commuter times. The trains get SO crowded that they actually have \u2018pushers\u2019. Yep. There are white-gloved people who get paid to push you or shall I say squish you onto the metro."

The Tokyo Metro is undoubtedly one of the most extensive mass transport systems in the world, serving a mega city that is home to millions of people and visited by millions of tourists. It's also probably the dream network envied and aspired for by other cities of the world. Aside from the trains being very reliable as to time, train stations are conveniently located and lines ensure that major areas are served. The Metro is also connected to major lines going in and out of the city. How I wish we can have this kind of convenient, reliable and affordable mode of transport back home. It would certainly raise the quality of life and ensure time is always well spent."

It was a little overwhelming at times, due to the extensive number of lines that there are to travel on, however, it helped to look at the colour of the lines, as well as the associated numbers for each station ie A10, A11 etc etc! Very, very comprehensive and convenient! I recommend picking up a copy of the \"Tokyo Metro Guide\" it has a largely simplified map inside (as well as the comprehensive one) with some great places to visit marked on the simplified version! If you can, pick up a Tokyo 3 day metro pass for 1500 Yen - as a tourist, it saved me soooo much money! If you google \"Tokyo subway 3 day ticket\" you will find out where they are available! It allows you unlimited travel on all Tokyo Metro lines and all Toei Subway lines for 3 days! Amazing!!! Please note that note all lines are Tokyo metro lines or toei lines, so be sure to check :)"

HOWEVER, at the end of your trip, you can get back your deposit AND any remaining balance! (I did this at the subway turnstile counter on the way out of the train station at Narita). Use your card by placing it over the indicator through the turnstile...and no more figuring out ticket costs for each trip (OR!! repurchase for each new 'private' train line.)"

Because Japan has such good train network it's so easy to explore and get close to real life in Japan.Although we travelled to lots of cities in Japan during our trip, much of our time was spent in and around Tokyo where we used the trains and subways every day. We used our JR rail pass until it expired then we used SUICA cards. We got ours from a machine at our local station and we took our children's passports to a JR ticket office and got them children's SUICA cards so they only paid 1/2 price. We went to a Daiso store (\u00a5100 store) and got card holders and cords so we could put them around our necks when dashing on and off trains. The great thing was that we didn't need to worry about buying tickets for every train we could just scan and go. There are top up machines at most stations and you can select English instructions. Most trains show a station map so you can count how many stops until you need to get off, but many trains also tell you in English what station is coming up next. If all else fails don't be afraid to ask someone for help. We found people very friendly and most understood enough English to be able to help us.We downloaded the Japan Trains app from the Google Play store, which made it super easy to plan which trains to catch. Just Google the nearest station to where you want to go, put it in the app and it will tell you the different routes and fares. The app also shows the stations in Kanji so we could show our screen to JR staff or other passangers if we wanted to confirm we were on the waiting in the right for the right track. We lived by the motto 'there's always another train' because if we missed one there was usually another coming just a few minutes later. Obviously the trains get very crowed at times, but we always felt safe and people were very polite even in the most cramped spaces. We often had adults giving up their seats for our children, especially at night when people could see they were tired. We chambered up 1000's of stepes as we rushed to make connecting train transfers. But, there are escalators and lifts if you need them too.Most stations have restaurants, cafes and convenience stores. Lots also have shopping malls attached as well. All in all super convenient and absolutely brilliant service!"

Both of them are different operators but use the same platform. It is the cheapest and most convenient way to move around this beautiful city of Tokyo. Most of the tourist sites are within a short walking distance from the many stations. The key is identifying which station the place you want to visit is located and finding the right exit. To use the metro, just go to the ticket machine and look at the metro map. It will tell you where you are and how much it cost you to go to that particular station. You can pay by coins or bank notes. If you intend to travel a lot l suggest you get the one day subway ticket which cost \u00a51000 which allows you to travel on all the metro lines except the JR lines which you have to buy a separate ticket. There is a one day pass that cost \u00a51590 that all you to travel on all the lines. The signs are usually in both japanese and english. It is a little difficult initially but once you get the hang of it is easy as abc as what l found out.

If you are using google maps be warned that on a number of occasions it told us the wrong direction we should have been heading in so double check!You will definitely be using the subway to get around in Tokyo either way but if subways are your thing, the Hong Kong MTR (subway) system is by far the best and most modern I have seen."

It operates from 6am to Midnight 7 days a week. As well as normal fares which are around Y200 per trip, there are also 1 day tickets for Y800 and 2 day tickets available for Y1200, which offer unlimited travel for 1 or 2 days. The metro can get crowded in peak times, so take care. Trains run every 3-5 minutes so there is always another train soon enough. The best way to travel around Tokyo"

The thing is, it's not really a single subway system, but three or more systems with minimal interactions with one another (Metro, Toei, and JR). Transfers are difficult and expensive. Just because there are two lines that overlap doesn't mean there will be a station there. You may have to pass through poorly marked ticket gates two or three times within one station. There are fees for transferring from one company's line to another's. There are two payment options: 1) go to a ticket machine and figure out the fare to the stop you want, 2) buy a cash card. Option 1 is just laughable. In one of the most high-tech cities in the world you still have to do the calculations yourself and buy a paper ticket. Option 2 leads to price gouging if you use one of the company's cards to pay the fare on another company's line.Bring a decent map before you arrive. One that both gives station names in your native language AND Japanese, and that clearly denotes which lines are operated by which companies. Other negative reviewers have noted that the maps are difficult to read if you don't know Japanese. Well, my second time in Tokyo I was with a Japanese woman from out of town, and I had to explain the maps to her!Finally, the attendants at the ticket gate windows may or may not be particularly helpful. But thankfully, if you stand around looking like a confused/exasperated foreigner for a few minutes, odds are a civic-minded Tokyo resident will help sort you out."

I'm giving it a low rating to hopefully have some impact on the ranking. That said, trains are the way to get around in Tokyo. If you are visiting, purchase a Suica or Pasmo rechargeable card. You can get these from the ticket vending machines that are labeled with Suica or Pasmo (as opposed to regular train ticket machines). The cost will be \u00a52000, and will include \u00a51500 credit. This will greatly simplify your use of any train line (and there are quite a few privately owned lines in addition to JR and Tokyo Metro). Watch the ticket gates for 30 seconds and you'll figure out how to use. While we're at it, please observe how other people are acting on the train. In Korea, people are excitedly talking and cell phones are going off everywhere. In Japan, in general, people are more reserved. They sit quietly, or talk in hushed tones. Act however you want, but keep in mind that loud talking and laughing only reinforces a negative stereotype of Westerners here."

Download the english PDF map of the system to your phone - most of the train car signs have both english and japanese maps, but a few didn't.2. Unlike the London or Paris systems that use the first/last stops on the line as the designator, use the letter and number abbreviation both for the stop you are getting off on, and to make sure you're going the right direction. The stop signs have a big letter and number in the middle with an arrow pointing in the direction its going with a smaller letter and number for the next stop.3. If you're going to be there for a couple days, get either a Pasmo or Suica card. Its basically a debit card that you prepay at the little vending machines, and each time you go through you just wave the card over the gate and it simply debits the correct amount from the card. You can recharge the card. Way easier and quicker that trying to use the ticket vending machines for a one way ticket each time."

Cars are clean, stations are clean and frequency is good. If a JR train and metro both go to the same station, take JR train since metro may not always be covered.

Ignoring the JR trains there are 2 different metro companies, this makes it complicated if you want to buy tickets. The easiest thing for us was to buy day tickets (or multi day) for both lines. There is the subway ticket for tourists which gives you a discount on this, we should have bought this but didn't at Narita and would have had to go to another station to get it so we just got the 1000 yen one. For us this was definitely worth it as we used the metro quite a bit. I also recommend getting the iPhone app: Tokyo Subway navigation for tourists its free and not only tells you how to get from one station to another but also how long it will take and specifically the exit to take for attractions near that station. Being from Boston I am not used to such a high end metro system, nor am I used to such large stations, the exits numbers matter a lot so you will want to know which one to take when you arrive at a station. In addition knowing the number of the station in addition to the name is very useful as it can be hard at times to see the English signs. Finally try to familiarize yourself with the signs the first few times you ride, even after we figured things out we did still sometimes walk towards the wrong platform or struggle to find the right exit.Beyond the fact that the metro is complicated it incredibly clean, reliable and I found pretty cheap for what it offers."

            "review": "WHAT A GREAT SYSTEM.. I have just spent five weeks in Tokyo and in four words what a great system.I have used the Metro before with relatives or friends but this is the first time I have tackled it on my own. At first it can be a bit daunting, so many stations , so many lines , so many levels but after a time or two it becomes quite simple. There are plenty of signage boards at the stations in English showing all the stations and different lines and where to change etc.There are always staff in the little offices at the gates who are only too happy to help you and their are plenty of staff on the platforms doing their thing and they will make sure your getting on the right train or as a last resort ask a local traveller.It is very interesting to watch the platform staff on the busy stations perform, very formal and efficient. The stations themselves can be like shopping centres, you can buy nearly anything you want without leaving the station and the different levels of lines can be five levels below you . Don't worry about missing a train as the next one is only a couple of minutes away, I personally never bothered to look at a time table, one leaves and another arrives , beautiful. The best thing is to buy what they called a SUICA CARD, I was given one the first day I arrived and it was the best thing ever.Put money on the card and then you just swipe on and off as you enter and leave a station.This card you can also use at most convenience stores in Tokyo and even some tourist attractions, it is brilliant, without it you have to keep going to machines and buying individual tickets which can be confusing and time consuming.They have a unique way of lining up for trains which I still don't quite understand especially at busy times but no problem just follow the locals. The system moves millions of people per day so morning and afternoon peak time is crazy and best to be avoided but on saying that I think you should do a peak time trip just for the heck of it , it is a once off experience you should have, I found it exciting and would not miss it.Another interesting thing is that during peak times their are woman only carriages, sorry guys no men only carriages,Take note that the Japanese commuters are very orderly and quiet, talking loudly and talking on the phone is frowned on and I have never once seen any loutish behaviour. Yes travel the Metro it is super efficient and a great way to see the amazing city of Tokyo, have fun I did."

            "review": "Best railway system ever!. Trains arrive every two to four minutes and quickly transport you to your destination. The Tokyo Metro is the most efficient railway system I have ever experienced. There are hundreds of stations on dozens of lines all over Tokyo and it's surrounding suburbs and there's never a single issue. The easiest way to make your way around the city, with stations located near every major suburb and attraction. Make sure you grab a map your first day in Tokyo for easy navigating, you will use it every single day! When at the station, follow the signs navigating you to each line via letter and colour. The signs will include how long the walk is to each platform, as many of the stations can be over a kilometre in length, and depending on what entrance you take into the station, the walk can be quite extensive. Every station is numbered along the line, and at the stations signs will indicate which way the trains are going (what the next station/number is etc) and announcers on the train will tell you in Japanese and English when to change for another line. You might have to take two or three different lines to get to a particular station, but due to the trains coming so often, it really is very easy. If you grab yourself a map and follow the subway signs, you will have no trouble navigating the Tokyo Metro, and will find getting around Tokyo so easy and pain free. One more thing to mention - each subway entrance will be labelled with a number/letter. Take note of this number when you're entering to make it easier for you to find the right exit when you're returning. If you just take any exit you can often end up blocks away from where you're meant to be, and it can be very confusing to get back!"

Shinjuku and Ikeburko being amongst the worst offenders. I used the Metro app which helped enormously but having watched the locals using their equivalent and the numerous visits to helpful staff members couldn't persuade me to give it any more stars.

I was intimidated by the metro/train system on my first visit, but taking the metro and the JR trains is now one of my favorite things about visiting Tokyo each time I'm there. It helped to learn that there are two systems--the metro and the JR trains (the JR system covers a wider area). Don't bother with single tickets, as you can't move between the two systems on a single ticket. Buy a Suica or Pasmo card. Not only do you not have to worry about figuring out your fare, but the Suica and Pasmo cards also work as a form of debit card in most of the station shops and for the all-important drink vending machines that are everywhere (love the iced green tea and the iced coffee). If you are confused or need help, ask anyone--whoever you ask will help you or find someone who can. Be sure to line up for the train at the designated spots and speak quietly when on the train."

Plus there are always station staff on hand. The DK Tokyo guidebook available at any good bookshop or on the internet has an extensive subway map on the back page which we found invaluable for planning journeys. We found it was more economical to forget the various day passes etc. unless you're doing an extreme amount of journeys and just pay for single journeys as it's cheap as chips.The first time you use the machines, take a little extra time to figure it out.

But, if you study it carefully you will soon discover the endless possibilities of this world's most intense subway system.All the lines carry their name, letter and a color. Each station bears it's name and a number preceded by a letter of the line. The trains bear the same color as a stripe on wagons.First, you have to position yourself, find the place where you wanna go and decide the best and fastest option. Interchange stations are encircled on a map. While changing simply follow the signs (according to line name and color), then see which direction you need in order to go on the right track.TICKETS !! For me the best way is to buy a 1, 2 or 3 day (specially 3 day) Tokyo subway ticket on the airport upon arrival. It covers both, the Tokyo metro and Toei metro lines which you'll use. I didn't do that, as I was misled reading articles it doesn't pay off. That's not true. Tokyo is an enormous city, forget foot sightseeing, forget the buses which can be jammed in traffic. You are doomed on metro, and you'll use it extensively. That 3 day pass is only 1.500 Yen, and I spent over 3.000 Yen on the Pasmo card for 3 days. You can calculate yourself, one ride is approximately 180 Yen (depending on a distance traveled and lines used). You'll use at least 5 times the metro during the day.This Pasmo (or Suica, the same but different brand) card is the second best option. You buy a card which you can easily refill whenever you need on machines in every station. You validate it when entering, and they deduct the sum when exiting from metro. On the display is shown how much did you pay and how much you have left on your card. Don't get stressed if you haven't got enough on your card, you will easily pay the difference to very polite station attenders. The machines are easy to use. Just select English and follow the instructions on a touch screen. NOTE 1: Pasmo and Suica work nationwide. You can use them in Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima,..... (but there are better options for those cities, see reviews for them).NOTE 2: When finished with the need for the card you can return it at any metro station, and you'll get a 500 Yen deposit refund for the card, plus any unused money you have on it.STATIONS !! Stations are small underground cities. There are plenty of shops, shopping malls, restaurants, supermarkets,...you name it. You can easily get lost there. Just don't be distracted by those, know your way and follow the signs. The signs are bilingual, each has English explanations.EXITING the stations: DON'T just follow the crowd towards the nearest exit!!! You could exit a mile away from your desired point. Each station has several exits, some of them up to 10. When exiting the train find a big yellow list of exits. Find your aim (attraction you're heading for) on that list, and find out the corresponding exit number for it. Then just follow the signs towards that exit."

Each line is associated with the first letter of the train line name (e.g., A = Asakusa), the color of the line (e.g., green = Shinjuku) and then each stop is denoted by a number (e.g., A20 = Tokyo Sky Tree). Take a photo of the map on your phone so you can easily refer to it. When you get to the train platforms and need to determine which side of the track to be on, just look for the range of numbers that contains the stop where you are headed. For example, if you need A20, look for a sign at the platform that says something like \"A12-20\" and that will let you know that you are headed toward the Sky Tree. Simple!If your point of initiation is Haneda or Narita airport, just find the rails at the lower level of the airport. The information desks can help point you to the best line for you based on your destinations of choice. As with all subways, hang onto your ticket! You'll need it to get through the turnstyle to get in AND out of the train area (sometimes you will insert these multiple times) so you do not want to lose these. Prices are very reasonable and the trains are timed exceptionally well. The trains, platforms, entrances/exits, shops, food vendors, restrooms, etc. are all impeccably clean and efficient. The U.S. could learn a lot from the Japanese transit system!"

The only unfortunate thing about it for visitors is that the systems are operated by different companies and whilst efforts have been made to ensure connectivity that could be better. Another issue is that most Tokyo Metro Maps do not include information about the JR system, whereas often the JR Yamanote line may be the more convenient system to use within the city, especially for commutes between the main railway stations and the attractions near those stations. Nevertheless the subways and the commuter trains combined is definitely the best way to get around the city.

Shinjuku is the busiest station in the world with approx 3.7 million footfalls per day - yet is cleaner than most stations, the world over, that do not receive even one-tenth of footfalls. There is no fighting for seats even in crowded trains. The staff is super-friendly. Even for a traveller who has just arrived, the signposts can lead to the correct train. It takes some time to understand the ticketing machines, but they are very user-friendly.

Donning sunglasses, bright T-shirts, travel backpacks and massive grins at finally arriving in Japan, we sat down and promptly realised that everyone else in the packed carriage was a middle-aged Japanese businessman wearing a suit and most of them were staring at us. It's fair to say we felt a bit out of place.Anyway, you can't really beat the Tokyo Metro - compared to other subway networks such as Paris and London, it is cleaner, faster, and quieter. People do not talk on the trains at all, and nor should you. It is very reasonable priced and you will simply need to purchase a Pasmo or Suica card and top it up. Each station has a machine you can do this, which can be switched to English. By my calculations, around a week's worth of frequent travel could be fulfilled by 5000 yen per person, which is about \u00a330. The card is then used to scan yourself in and out of the stations.Contrary to what some people have said, I believe it is fairly easy to navigate as long as you have a map with you. A pocket-sized subway map was strangely hard to find so just ask for one at the tourism/information desk at the station you're at rather than wandering around searching. Most stations have fairly good English translations and with the help of the display screens on the trains you can usually be confident of where you're going.The screens on the trains are very useful - they won't just update you on the route, and how long it is going to take to get to each stop, but they provide a blueprint of the next station so you know which side to wait on and where the doors to exit the station are going to be on the platform. The Tokyo Metro is just like the London Underground, but 10 years in the future."

The subway system is remarkably efficient and you will rarely be waiting more than five minutes for a train. Signage is in both English and Japanese although station entrances are not necessarily conspicuous from the street. Ticket machines, available in English are located at all stations and day passes which are valid for a 24 hour period can be purchased for 1000 yen (about $10 AUD). The amount of people who utilise the subway is homage to its efficiency; even at close to midnight businessmen, students and trendy young things are rushing on and off carriages on their way home. Some subway stations also connect to JR lines and I\u2019d recommend purchasing a pass for travel on these lines if you plan on going outside Tokyo (see below).Gents, be aware that on weekday mornings until 9:30 some decorated pink carriages at the front of the train are designated female only in an effort to ward off wandering hands in crowded peak hour commuter carriages. JR EastJapan Rail combines the suburban rail network, Narita Express and Shinkansen (bullet trains). If you are travelling outside of the Tokyo area, utilising JR is a must. Special passess are designated for tourists and must be bought prior to entering country. A five day pass that\u2019s valid for fourteen days will cost about $280 AUD and use is only counted on the day you travel so you don\u2019t need to travel on consecutive days to get your money\u2019s worth. Initially purchase of the pass is fairly hassle free however acquiring it once in country can prove a hassle and was the only time we were failed by the usual Japanese efficiency.On arrival in Tokyo, present your purchase printout and passport to a booth located near the entrance to the subway at Narita airport. Although the line was only around 30 people deep it took us nearly two hours to get our pass \u2013 not my preferred way of spending my time after a long haul flight. The Narita Express has regular trains running between Tokyo and Narita airport. The carriages are spacious, comfortable and clean. Seats can be reserved in advance either online or at the station. Drinks and food are available for purchase and unlike the subway, eating is encouraged on-board.Shinkansen is the fastest way to get around if you are travelling a long distance. The ride from Tokyo to Nagano takes around 90 minutes vice a four \u2013 five hour trip on a bus. The ride is surprisingly smooth and feels like you\u2019re 40,000 feet up rather than on the ground.TaxisYou won\u2019t normally need to use a taxi in Tokyo unless you have a large amount of luggage or have been partying into the night and missed the last train. As with all other transport options in Japan, taxis are extremely clean and the drivers friendly and courteous. Most will not speak English so it\u2019s a good idea to have a map or the name of your destination written in Japanese."

The main reason is that there are two main subway companies: Tokyo Metro and Toei Metro additionally to the JR railway system and they do not connect on a level that you might be used to from other Metropoles around the world. If you get a subway map and don't find a subway to the place you want to go - don't give up, just check the other map. Or even the Railway. Be aware that you often have to leave the metro station in order to get to the other metro line (of the other company) and that you have to buy a seperate ticket for that as well. Asking my japanese friends from Tokyo how they get somewhere they all say \"no idea, but I have an app for that\". Highly recommended. If you do not have an app, make sure you have the metro maps of both companies, and ideally of the Japan Railway (JR) which can save you lots of time during your trip!"

Platform guards call out the destination, thank you for travelling with them and bow as you leave each station. The trains themselves are spotlessly clean. Everything is pristine...the carriages, the stations, the platforms. There are no litter bins because there is no litter! The information on the trains is in Japanese, Korean and English. There are live, visual diagrams giving clear and coherent information. It makes life easy in a country where I'm not yet familiar with the language."

No other country has got a system that\u2019s more efficient, clean, ingenious and well managed. It\u2019s mainly divided into JR lines and Metro. Sometimes you have to exit one to get to the other, but signage is clear and locals/attendees go above and beyond to help you, should you have any issues. Depending on your location and destination, each trip costs around 200 yen. E.g. Shinjuku to Shibuya is around 120 yen, whereas Shinjuku to Asakusa is about 350 yen. We got a momo card, and topped it up with 2,000 yen, which lasted 5 days (stayed in Shinjuku, used it at least twice a day)."

First note that there are several competing lines and I could not find a map that showed all of them. So, we stuck with the biggest, the Tokyo Metro line, in combination with the JR Yamanote circle line. We never tried any Toei trains.If you want to use these lines buy a Suica pre-pay smart card from a kiosk at any station. Simply flash the card at the turnstile reader and you're off. If needed add more yen. You can also use the card at many station eateries and vending machines. We also used the card in Yokohama. Before you leave Japan simply sell the card back for full value at a JR ticket office (like when you buy your ticket on the Narita Express to NRT).Best tip - don't rush out of any train station. Figure out which of the numerous exits is closest to your destination.Interesting note - Japanese do not yak on their cell phones while on any trains. What a pleasant surprise."

This can be a challenge in many foreign countries but it is always an interesting experience. The Tokyo metro system is one of the most impressive systems I have yet found. There are several interconnecting lines that will get you to any part of the city in a timely fashion. As a tourist, I used the 2 day pass (bought at the airport), more to save time than money. This pass lets you get on any of the subways within the city, although the pass does not work on the JR above ground train that goes around the city (Think Lost in Translation). The metro system provides great maps and signage, with instructions (written and oral) in English. Once you figure out how to use the maps to exit the subway (a little tricky at first) and link these to a tourist map, you will be able to exit the subway very close to your intended destination. The city has several street level maps of the local area (close to subway entrances and bus stops). I found these great to get my bearings and walk throughout the city without ever getting too lost. Combined with walking, this is the best way to get around Tokyo."

It totally didn't come as a surprise to me that Tokyo Metro is listed as a top destination in TripAdvisor, because Tokyo rail transportation is in itself a wonderful experience.Trains servicing Tokyo Metro are generally clean and are punctual by the minute. Train stations are likewise clean, despite most of them being old structures in use for nearly a century. Huge train stations tend to be labyrinthine in configuration, but accurate directions and labels are provided. Such directions are bilingual at the least; some even have translations in four languages.For my own strolls, I make use of the Tokyo Metro Day pass at around 700yen. The pass may be used for a whole day and is applicable for all Tokyo Metro Stations. This makes trips to Tokyo very affordable, and gives a traveller plenty of destination options. Many Tokyo attractions are near a Tokyo Metro Station; but on a rare case in which there isn't any nearby, a traveller may still opt to avail of other affordable passes that allow entrances to Tokyo Metro and other railways (e.g. JR East, Toei).Probably the only setback with Tokyo Metro is that like any other Japanese railway service, it gets a little too busy and packed on rush hours, but that shouldn't be a bother if a trip is planned not to fall on crazy hours."

The machines can be set to English and you just follow instructions to both purchase one and charge it up with yen value (minimum 1,000 yen) and off you go. Each time through a turn style you tap and go and it debits the card telling you the remaining balance. Each metro station is often multi-layered but the English signage is easy to follow. This card can also be used on other lines such as the metro JR ones. But if you have a JR rail pass use that instead. If you find you are going in the wrong direction just get off and changed sides of the platform. Its all great fun and easy to use."

The two networks combined serve the majority of commuter ridership in Tokyo. Punctual, fast, clean and safe, this method of transportation will serve you best if you work in or visit Tokyo. Surface streets and toll highways in Tokyo are always bumper to bumper and it probably takes twice as long and 3 times as expensive to get from one place to another. With such a extensive network, visitors are often totally confused, found standing in front of the ticket machines in stations staring at the board wondering what route to take. It is a good idea to map out your \"strategy\" before you leave your hotel. You may need to take one or two transfers. IC cards such as Suica or Pasmo cards replace ticket purchase confusion in calculating your ticket price automatically. Just tap in through the gates on the way in and out. No need to tap again at transfers except when you transfer between the two systems, Tokyo Metro and Toei. You can buy these cards at most ticket machines in JR, subway or private rail stations. There is about a $5 card fee which is refundable if you decide to turn in your card before you leave Japan. Forget taxis. They are very expensive. They are only good for short distance because the base fee of $7-8 are set for the first 2 km. Buses are also everywhere but if you don't read Japanese, it may be very difficult to find your way around and they are often stuck in heavy traffic. On the other hand, the Metro has clear signs in English (Roman alphabet) and many places in Chinese and Korean characters. Some major stations even have PA in English.Best way to travel within Tokyo."

Firstly buy an IC card this will avoid having yo buy Seperate tickets for each journey and remember the lines all have different owners so you may need several tickets to get from a to b an IC card cuts all that hassle out. You can top it up easily at the fair adjustment machines if you go out of credit your exit will close and you will need to re credit it before leaving the station. The metro is pretty good, but I found it was not always easy to find the name of the station I was at from the train as station names are often in small font and the signs are not as frequent as other metros. Many of the trains do not have real time maps so again it can be easy to miss the station you want so keep your wits about you. It is incredibly busy and if you get a seat during rush hours you will be very lucky. One thing I found odd was that some of the lesser lines are not displayed on the official map and additionally some stations do not appear on the maps either. Generally there will be a staff person on every platform and at every exit, most have a basic understanding of English if you want a specific place but can't find the exit or train etc just say to them \"sumimassen, (place name) wa doko desu ka\" between you you will figure it out. Considering they must answer thousands of similar questions each day they were all very polite and helpful.Try and learn the Japanese number system Itchy nee San etc so you understand platform numbers when they answer you. Some stations have dozens of exits over several floors and choosing the wrong exit could mean a long walk to find where you want to be so do research on which exit you need before heading off out or at least ask the staff."

That could be due in large part to those that use the system. The passengers are orderly, turn their phones off or to silent when boarding and don't often eat or drink in the cars. Much of that has to do with Japanese culture, but it makes for a unique subway experience. While I'd rather take a taxi, this subway provides a cheap, easy, and efficient way to get around Tokyo."

Even the \"Fare Adjustment\" machine didn't cause any dramas for us. Fares are not expensive.If all else fails ask the station staff who are always on duty while trains are running. We found them to be very helpful.Trains ran every few minutes and even during peak periods when they were crowded it was still fairly easy to get on and off, but start moving towards the carriage exits before you stop as the trains only remain stationary for very short periods of time.Finding correct platforms at stations to change lines was also fairly easy once we worked out the color coding system.Trains are clean and graffiti free. If you miss a train don't panic, there is another one in a couple of minutes. For the number of people they carry the journey is remarkably quiet as there are no loud phone conversations and almost no conversations at all between passengers.

If you read this, I recommend one thing. This will save you a lot of time and headache and possibly a lot of money. Get a PASMO card!!!! This is a game changer for the subway because since the subway companies integrated recently it will let you ride all of the subways on one card and you won't have to buy tickets each time you want to ride; thus save you money by getting charged exactly what you use. The place you get the card is next to the turnstile and ticket machines. Ask for help to get the card. The machines are pink and you can't miss them. This card lets you use the bus, train and metro. It also allows you to pay in certain convenience stores and vending machines. When you leave Tokyo you can return it and get your money back, or just keep it for the next trip - like I did :)Side note about this is that if you are in Tokyo for one day it is not worth it. This card is only useful for a several day trip. You also need one per person. The advantages of the metro are: always on time, very efficient, minimal switching if needed, friendly (and sometimes English) staff to point you in the right direction and ease of use.Cons: can be very busy. some stops have Japanese with white gloves that literally push you onto the subway. fun experience, but it can be a bit claustrophobic"

You'll be able to get hold of the train timetable at the stations or online. The beauty lies in the reliability of the timetable, ie when it says it will arrive at 1.54pm, it will arrive at that time, making planning a breeze. For tourists, day passes are available for sale at the stations. For single trip ticket purchases, the route map has very clear fare indications and connections, which leaves little room for confusion. When unsure, the friendly station master is always around to help, albeit many with limited English fluency which I didn't see an issue at all as many will go all out to help you.Do note priority seating and cabins, especially during rush hours. Do not use mobile phones or talk loudly onboard the train.Should you travel during colder seasons, the heater (usually installed underneath the seats) will be turned on to warm the commuters."

Thankfully the staff and regular Japanese will go out of their way to help you and explain how the ticket machines work. There are about 8 lines crossing the city, each are colour coded and each station has a letter and number. Easiest mistake to make is to be on the right line but going the wrong way. Check the stations at the end of the line you want to go on. Even if you do stuff up, staff will help you. Things you'll notice inside the trains are, massive amounts of advertising and the really low hand holds hanging from the ceiling. When you stand up to get off I swear you will bang your head over and over again."

Its actually made up of several railway companies intertwined in the same rail map, Metro, JR, Keisei, and some other individual lines. So make sure to pick up a rail map at the airport when u first arrive. If you happen to arrive tokyo from Narita airport, you may also want to pick up a Metro day pass, 6xx yen for 1 day, 9xx yen for 2 days. You can get it at the tourist information counter in the arrival hall, its a credit-card-sized-green-soft- bendy-plastic-card. The day pass is only limited to the metro line though (that means no yamanote line, that belongs to JR) but i got around to all the major areas fine (shinjuku, harajuku, shibuya, asakusa, ikebukuro, tsukiji, odaiba and the like). I'd say if you will be going to more than 3 locations around town, it'd be cheaper to get the day pass. If you dont buy a day pass, then you will need to buy tickets for each time u take the train. To buy tickets, you will need to find the station you want to go to on a huge map and check the fare for that station. Then just buy the ticket with the correct fare. The ticket machines have understandable english.Transit between rail lines will make u feel like a mouse looking for cheese in a lab maze, with signs pointing to 6 different cheeses in different directions. But the signage is reliable if you can follow them properly."

Fares are priced by distance and start at 170 yen ($1.80 au) you can buy these from a ticket window or machine. Machines are easy to operate and have English options. Most of the bigger stations also have a staff member standing by to offer help if needed. The bigger underground stations house restaurants, conbinis (convenience stores) and even little bars! Busier lines such as the Yamanote (which circles through Shinjuku, Harajuku and Tokyo station among others) do get very crowded. In my year living in Japan this was never a problem. Tokyo is such a densely populated city that Tokyoites are accustomed to this and will show extreme respect for the personal space of others.Often joked about...if a train ever does happen to run past a few minutes late (and by a few I mean 2 minutes) an apology will sound over the loudspeaker!

I used this transport during my visit to Tokyo in Apr '14.What can I say about this wonderful piece of engineering? Almost every corner of Tokyo is connected by 2 lines - the Tokyo metro and the Toei lines. Tokyo metro has 9 lines - all underground.All stations are easily accessible and can be identified on the ground with a symbol 'M' in white on blue background. Boards indicating the nearest stations along with the distance in metres are put on the ground. I was awed.Inside the subway, there is a station office, a lost and found section. Though officers know only some English, they help as much as possible. Metro maps, attractions in Tokyo and other pamphlets are available free for pick-up. Commuters promptly bring things lost by other commuters to the station office and write down at what time and where they found it. Kind of a heaven on Earth, isn't it? Which country's citizens are so prompt? Card recharge and ticket pick-up counters are just beside the gates. Though all info are in Japanese, they have exclusive pages for information in English at the press of a button. I never saw anyone cheat, jump a queue or travel without a ticket.Routes to all trains or different lines are marked clearly so that no one could get lost. People are expected to stand (indicated in sign boards) on the left side of the escalator so that others who want to climb up faster could use the right side. And every single person followed it. I think these things are ingrained in their blood because they follow it impromptu without any kind of supervision from anyone.And train timing (and frequency), as everyone know, could be used to set our watch times - on the dot. Board inside says that mobile phones should be in silent mode and no one should talk inside the train. And everyone follow it without questioning.Cleanliness everywhere is a given.Anyone visiting Tokyo cannot miss using this service as it connects almost every corner and is presumably the fastest and cheapest mode of transportation. I am awestruck with the service, good attitude of Japanese citizens, connectivity, accessibility and ease of using Tokyo metro."

Out of all the modern cities in the world I have been to, Tokyo boasts (not exactly anything to boast about) the worst subway system out of the lot.For a start, its very expensive. Its too expensive. Compare it to Seoul where you pay a flat rate and can get anywhere in the city for the same price. Perfect model. Price ranges from where you go, how long you go, how many lines you use, which line you use.The fact that it is owned my x amount of companies is a very negative factor, and this is an issue that really needs to be addressed, one of many, before Japan hosts both the Rugby World Cup in 2019 and the Olympics in 2020. Having to pay for one line then pay again for another makes sense for the companies who own it, but those who have to use it get financially robbed. Its a farce.Another major issue of the Tokyo Subway is... there are not enough cars to accommodate the commuters. When you see so many people cramming into space that doesn't exist, you question the mindset of people. If there were more cars, and the platforms were designed for a city of 20 odd million people (an estimated guess), then the crammed car issue may be alleviated. As it stands, a morning ride in the subway is enough to ruin ones morning.The last point is the choice of voice on the subway. The female announcer has possibly one of the worst voices on earth and is enough to ruin my day on a daily basis, as a Tokyo resident."

It was well worth the time and I highly recommend expending the effort.Shinjuku Station was overwhelming enough without the added burden of commencing one's learning curve upon arrival.Metro map link:http://www.tokyometro.jp/en/subwaymap/pdf/routemap_en.pdfWelcome the challenge and enjoy the satisfaction of a day's jam-packed sightseeing agenda successfully accomplished."

(2 hours a day)in the beginning you will get lost (for example Shinuku station, so many exits) but really nice, fast way of getting around Tokyo.Last, during rush hour (half of the day) it's really busy. and you will be packed in the subway. and eveybody is pushing so eveyone gets in. but no one is screaming or fighting becasue you push, it's normal, eveyone want on the train. people around the world can learn a lot from Japanse people!"

            "review": "Transport Perfection. The Tokyo Metro and JR Train systems of Tokyo are outstanding. Their advantages are obvious (1) They are kept meticulously clean (2) Arrive on time and if you miss a train, another should be there within 5 minutes (3) Travel to all parts of Tokyo. Given all of the above they are good value for money in my opinion, although I am from Australia where transport tends to be ridiculously expensive.There are a few tips people should remember to avoid issues(1) There are coloured maps in the stations which display the various lines and which stations these lines stop at. When I previously traveled in 2009 this was all Kanji but in recent times there are English labels as well so select where you want to go and there will be a number, indicating the number of Yen you will be required to pay to travel to this location. To figure out what line you need to travel on look at the colour of the line of the station you are travelling to and check the legend for colours (ie it will say \"Sobu Line\" = Yellow, \"Yamonate Line\" = Green) - that is the line you need to find. Around the station there will be arrows indicating the lines, which will have the same colours as displayed in the board. It will give you two platform options for that line depending which direction you want to go in, there is normally a second map near the platform that ensure you are heading in the right direction - even if you get this wrong and end up on the train travelling in the wrong direction this isn't a big deal, simply just get off the train at the first stop and swap to the opposite platform, there won't be any additional financial consequences. Some stops may require you to transfer, just figure it out using the coloured system and know which station you need to get off at for the transfer - you don't have to pay for 2 tickets in these situations. Once you get to your station get out of the train and place you ticket in the ticket machine before leaving the station. If you got your fare wrong that isn't a big deal, there is a fare adjustment machine which you can place you ticket in and will adjust the additional cost of the fare, giving you the correct one. It is easy once you have done it once or twice.(2) There is a whole bunch of etiquette for trains in Tokyo and you will actually find signs (IN Japanese) requesting you abide by these. Most of them support the trains being a quite place where people can (and will) sleep. These include- Never blow your nose on a train, this is considered rude- Don't talk loudly and don't ever talk on your mobile phone in a train- No music on trains- There are certain seats (normally have a different colour and pictures of elderly/pregnant/injured people on them) that are priority seats and are only suitable for priority passengers such as thoise above- When getting on a escalator, one side (I believe its the left) is for people who want to stand still on the escalator, the other is for people who want to walk up it. Do not stand on the wrong side otherwise you will annoy people. These sides can change from city to city- With the trains more than the metro there are women only carriage - this is marked on the door and have been established to reduce instances of gropping(3) Tips - Try to avoid rush hours if you can, including 0700-0900 and 1700-1900 as you will be standing and cramped like a tin of sardines- There are limited ramps and lifts in the station and these can be an issue for those will mobility issues. Lots of stairs- There are cards including Suica cards where you can pre-pay. They are poorly advertised to tourists but can save money and convenience for those who get them - Don't throw away your ticket ever, you need it to exit the destination stationOtherwise enjoy the metro, it is a strangely interesting experience."

I think it's a bit ridiculous that it costs you 160 yen to go to either 1 station or 3-4 stations then if you need to transfer to a station on a DIFFERENT line one station away, you're forced to pay ANOTHER 160 yen to transfer a short distance like this. Compared to countries like Singapore and Taiwan, train travel can get very very expensive using the Tokyo Metro (and any other rail company in Japan for that matter).Besides the cost, the train is very timely and will get you where you need to go fairly easily."

A coloured map is offered at hotels or airport (with a legend) indicating Metro/JR rail/ or private lines; the minimun cost is about 130 yen, but a day pass get be purchased at your hotel for 600 yen; otherwise tickets are purchased by machines that have an english option; Simply pick the place you want to go, look on the board for the number (this is the amount of yen of ticket you need to purchase) use the machines to purchase a ticket to that amount of yen; your map will tell you which line you need to find and follow (note the number of the station eg: Hanzomon is the purple cirle Z line and you maybe at Z12 and need to go to Z5 so you head toward that platform. AND... if you can't seem to find the amount of yen needed you can simply purchase the cheapest fare, and when you get to your destination there are fare adjustment machines that you simply insert your ticket and it will tell you how much extra yen is required, add it to the machine, it will give you a new ticket and then you can exit... word of the wise make sure you look at the exit numbers this is helpful to exit where you want... each station has a very easy map to figure out which one you want to exit because when your out on top it is really hard to work your way around the block when you cant read the street signs... Note to mention the map will help you avoid THE STAIRS there are heaps... and there is a KEEP LEFT ruleNote JR rail own the loop train in the centre so that will be an additional cost.Oh and if you missed your stop, easy just get off, walk across the platform 5 steps and get on the reverse running train... presto!"

I cannot recall the initial price you pay for it, but trust me, it beats having to buy a separate ticket for each journey as not every station as an English fare chart. I'm actually surprised that it isn't more publicized for tourists. Anyway, the subway is hands down the best way to get around in Tokyo....clean, efficient, and on time! Another bonus, Japanese passengers are usually very polite - no loud talking, music etc. Actually, you will see signs advising against these acts on the train. One thing to note, avoid these three times: rush hour (0700-0900), lunch time (1200ish), and last train (0000-0100). Trains get really packed, especially for the last train. If you miss the last train, taxis charge a premium fare so make sure you plan accordingly."

It is a good, reliable and clean metro system (interlinked with the JR system) and comparable with the system in HK and Singapore, even though it is far more expensive. If you need help with directions and do not speak Japanese, you may have a hard time. So do your homework beforehand. The locals have a tendency to rush (if not run), regardless of whether they are going to work or returning home, despite the frequency of trains. If you are knocked over by another commuter in a rush, he will probably turn back (if at all) to see who he had knocked over rather than to apologise or help you up. I would also advise against standing too near the doors when you are in the train as the locals also have the practice of forcing their way in (by backing into a crowded train) and you could find in a very very tight spot. You will have to pay 2 sets of fare if you interchange between JR and the Metro on a journey, and as such you may want to see if you can get to the same destination using one system rather than both. Many of the main JR stations is a mall in itself, and you can shop and dine without even leaving the station or surfacing to ground level."

            "review": "JR Rail Pass and the clean efficient and fast paced Tokyo Metro. I do not see a category for the JR Rail Pass, so let me start by saying that if you are going to be in Japan for 3, 4 or more days, this is the best investment you can make. It pays for itself just using it back and forth to the airport. It also allows you to travel on the local JR lines the encircle the city and the high speed bullet trains, the Shinkansen lines. The cost is 28,300 Yen which you can calculate to your currency, but approximately $290. I used it just one way back to the airport (I used the bus into the city). I also used the Shinkansen high speed bullet train to Kyoto, Nikko and part way to see Mt. Fuji. The cost of the Shinkansen train to Kyoto was equal to the total cost of the rail pass, so I repeat it is a great bargain to get the JR Rail pass. This pass must be purchased in your home countries. It is NOT sold in Japan. If you are in a big city, there will be many agencies selling the pass. Do not pay a fee above the 28,300 Yen. Agencies get commissions from JR. It can be purchasd online and by mail. I also used it for many local trains around the city. All of these trips, we just flashed our pass at the attendant and went right thru. No need to buy individual tickets and navigate thru ticket gates. That is a great time saver and stress reducer. This is just one of the transportation systems that make up the entire Tokyo Metro System, which is huge. There are many different companies that operate many different subway and train lines. The Tokyo Metro is actually one of the subway lines that operates in the city. It has 9 lines including the Ginza line, the Marunouchi line, and 7 others. Then there is the Toei system, which operates 6 lines, most notably the Oedo line, plus 5 more. There are also other independent lines, like the Yurikamone line, and Odakyu line and others. This is an extensive system and you should get yourself a good train map, because if you travel around the city, more than likely you will need to switch between lines. With the JR Rail Pass you can utilize their lines when it is convenient, and possibly part of your travels and then you will have to switch to another line, and the ticket will be much less than if you went the whole route without JR. Find out what other lines you need to take and you can buy a one day Tokyo Metro card to supplement your JR Rail Pass. The directions in the stations and outside are clear and in English and arrows will lead you in the right direction. The Shinjuku station is huge, if you are in that area, you will use it often. Try to find landmarks in the station to help guide you. We traveled to Tokyo station from Shinjuku many times, and after the first time knew exactly what path to take. Also in cities other than Tokyo, you can only buy tickets from a machine. What you do is look at the board. Determine your station and the station you are going to. It will give you a price and you insert that into the machine, and a ticket will come out. The ticket is based on the distance you are traveling, and not where you are going exactly. In my reviews of Kyoto, Nikko and Mt. Fuji, I discussed which Shinkansen trains to use, as they have many different lines, Kodama, Hikari, etc. I told myself, since this was my second time in Tokyo, that I would not get lost using the Shinjuku station, however I did on a number of occasions as it is so huge. Also remember your exits as Tokyo and Shinjuku stations have upwards of 10 exits. You will encounter a majority of businessmen and school children using the trains and they being experts versus us tourists, move quickly thru the stations and up the escalators and the platforms so be aware of your surroundings, but over all it is a very safe, clean and efficient system and a real joy and pleasant to use. Stations like Shinjuku and Tokyo and most others have news stands, bakeries, coffee shops and other stores selling just about everything you can imagine, so if you have time waiting for your train, you will not be bored."

Not too many trash bins though so plan how to dispose your stuff carefully. Very complex underground system of passages and connecting walkways. Many levels underground. Can feel overwhelming at first due to size, though it is full of guiding signs along the way. Look for the English words among the Japanese kanji. As you walk through it trying to switch from one line to another you will have to pass through many gates, meaning you will be asked to insert your ticket quite often. Pricing depends on the distance traveled and also on the subway company used. Seems like getting a daily pass for 1,000 yen makes life easier as it offers great flexibility to switch lines at ease without worry that you have used your \"point A to point B\" ticket and now cannot cross another gate without getting another ticket.You most likely will not encounter any shadowy characters there as the system feels very, very safe. Across the entire system you will see arrows telling you on which side to proceed, either left or right. Seems like the prevailing directive is to stick to the left side,at least on the escalators it looks like the rule. If there are two of you and you like to stand side by side on the escalator, don't do that. The right side of you is intended to be left for the passers by who do not feel like standing and they prefer to continue walking on the escalator. Overall, the system is very robust, probably overwhelming to some in the beginning, but it is a very efficient way to move around, well kept and safe."

The directions in the metro stations are very good and specific since they use platform numbers. If you follow the exits correctly, it will lead you to the exact place you are going. Be very careful to follow the correct exit. I once used the wrong one and found myself in the other side of the Shibuya station. Since I could not speak Japanese, it took a little while to find my destination. There are guard rails on the platforms, and their gates open when the train comes into the station. Other big cities should emulate this.The cost is reasonable and buying tickets was easy too. If I had any problems, the wonderful residents of Tokyo were very willing to assist, and even take me to the correct platform.

The stations and their many levels are cities unto themselves which must be experienced to enrich your Tokyo travel experience.I used the rail system exclusively (except Narita transfers) during a 10 day stay in Tokyo. Single woman traveling alone - felt absolutely safe at all times. I am a native Chicagoan - the Tokyo rail system is hands down the safest (personal and belongings) I have experienced.VITAL - a Metro Map, a PASMO card, Hyperdia.com, station landmarks, know your exit number and allow plenty of travel time!I wore my map out during my stay - keep it handy at all times!! They can be printed online or picked up at the stations, hotels, etc. I planned out most of my excursions and printed directions out for myself - this was really helpful. Towards the end of the trip, I stared winging it as I became more familiar. Pay particular attention to the Letter and Number designation of each stop. If nothing else, knowing you have to go from \"M04 to M16\" can help immensely. All the trains I rode were bilingual and had user-friendly graphics announcing stops and transfers.PASMO card - accepted by Metro and JR lines. Not on rail line in Kamakura. Not sure about others. Got this info from an ex-pat I met on the Great Tokyo Cycling Tour. Get a Pasmo card from a kiosk (press the English button) and keep it loaded. It frees you from calculating fares and those tiny little paper tickets. You need your ticket going in and out. The fare is calculated and deducted from your card. There is a 500 yen refundable deposit to purchase the PASMO card. The deposit and any unused credit can be refunded at the end of your stay in Tokyo. There is a 210 yen fee for the refund but well worth it...that is $2. I refunded my card on at the Odakyu Ticket office - as you enter the office, it is the line to the far left. The PASMO card can also be used on the busses (used mine in Yokohama) as well as in shops with the PASMO logo.Hyperdia.com - you can go online and enter your itinerary and it will generate several options with stations and times as well as transfer stations. I used Hyperdia before and during my trip. TIP - if the travel time is about the same between options, choose the one with the least number of transfers. I found Hyperdia to a superior travel planning tool - much better than most I've used in the States and Europe.Station Landmarks - make note of landmarks in your home station to help orient you - my base was Shinjuku Station which is unbelievably HUGE. It helped a lot to note some of the shops, etc. along my path...a shoe store, a set of lockers with a huge picture of Labrador puppies and an iPad sign were mine. I was always relieved when I found the shoe store on my way out :-)Know your exit number. All the stations have multiple exits (A1, West Gate, etc) that are labeled HOWEVER, not all streets have names or street signs. Most guidebooks and pamphlets have the station exit number listed in the attraction info - noting your exit number will reduce your wandering around time trying to get out. Just because the attraction has a street name, doesn't mean you will see signage when you pop out on the street. I personally found it easier to find my way underground and pop out in the correct place, vs. popping out and wandering above ground.Allow PLENTY OF TRAVEL time. Whatever you think you need, double it. As many have posted, the transfers between lines can be FAR apart. Take your time and follow the signs. If you are traveling during rush hour - especially if you are going against the flow - step out of the way to read the signs. Tokyo commuters are like any others in the world...on a mission to get to/from work - try to stay out of the way!! Enjoy the Tokyo Metro and rail lines!! It is fast, uber-efficient and a great way to learn about Tokyo!!!"

            "review": "Can be very confusing, slightly disjointed, but very efficient. The Tokyo mass transit system essentially consists of lines operated by 3 separate companies, the Tokyo Metro, the Toei, and JR.The downside to this is changing from one company's lines to another costs both time and money. There are interchange stations, but sometimes walking from one line to another can be hundreds of metres away, and means exiting and buying another ticket. Going from Station A to Station B can cost twice as much if you take one company's lines as opposed to another.It also means that there are no standardised maps; often maps issued by one company looks completely different to that issued by another; for example the JR lines are invariably coloured as black and white chequered on many maps, whereas its lines are also colour coded. Also stations however, have names clearly labelled in English words, and some trains even have announcements in English. Trains are fast and clean and efficient, and most stations have toilet facilities and locker storage. Many however, have lots and lots of stairs to climb, and wheelchair access may only be at one end of the platform/ station.All three company lines now operate under the same stored value card- in fact, two, which work exactly the same. The Suica or Pasmo card, which I would recommend for anyone taking public transport in Tokyo. It is a touchless card, and stores value in it, the amount being automatically deducted at the turnstiles, meaning you don't have to work out how much to pay before each journey.Large stations, especially those with JR lines, are worth visiting themselves. Varied and cheap eateries everywhere, bakeries, and other retail outlets are to be found. The Guinness World of Records lists Shinjuku station as the most visited station in the world, and I wouldn't be surprised if many visit just to shop! Shinjuku station, and Shibuya station, for example have department stores located within them, and have a fantastic food mall at the basement, definitely worth visiting for the culinary experience alone.A trip tends to cost from 130 yen to around 300 yen for a trip right across Tokyo. Cheaper than the London Underground!"

It can be confusing at first, especially during rush hour when the stations can get very crowded, but one can easily learn the system after a few days of using it as a mode of transport. Some tips that helped us during our trip:- There are several railway companies operating within and outside of Tokyo. Each has its own trains, lines and ticketing machines, but many lines intersect or stop at the same stations around Tokyo.- The major companies to remember within Tokyo are the Metro (2 kinds: Tokyo Metro and Toei Metro group) and the JR Railway. Each have their own maps, so it will be very handy to either download both maps onto your mobile phone/gadget or just ask for a copy from each company at their booths.- Ticketing machines have an English language option but do not display the names of the stations for you to choose from, unlike in other cities like Hongkong or Seoul. Only the fares are displayed and you have to determine how much your fare is by checking the large signboards above the machines. The signboards show either the names of all the stations available for that company ONLY or their map with the corresponding fares per station. Not all signboards have an English translation (especially for JR Railways) so in such cases, it would be best to just go to an agent near the turnstiles and show them the station you need to go to on your map. Then ask them how much you need to pay. - Some might think it would be easier to just stick to one company when traveling from one area to another, but some of the routes take longer; so changing from one company to another to find a shorter and faster route can also be done. - When transferring to a different railway company, however, a new ticket needs to be purchased at the station where you need to change lines/companies.- In case you paid the wrong amount for your ticket, there are fare adjustment machines at the stations where you can adjust your fare and get a new ticket.- Again, it's always easier to just go to a railway agent and ask for the best route to a certain place, and how much you need to pay for. Don't worry... They are very polite, helpful and can speak English (most of the time)."

Perhaps this review is slightly biased due to the fact that I visited Tokyo after 3 weeks in Seoul, but I must say that I was very surprised by how expensive and confusing the Tokyo metro system is relative to their Korean neighbors. I cannot read Japanese, and I often found that the signs which you use to determine the fare you should pay for your ticket were very difficult if not impossible to understand at many station stops. This is further complicated by the fact that the metro system consists of multiple companies whose ticket systems are isolated and not transferable. I HIGHLY recommend keeping a printout of the entire metro system in your pocket with you at all times...it saved me more times than I can count!Many times I would realize I had paid the wrong amount, so when I went to exit the station by putting my ticket into the exit lane, the gates would close and lock me in. Sometimes there was a station worker nearby that would help me to understand the fare difference I needed to pay to exit, but other times there was no one around. Also the little tickets that you get can be easily lost. Aside from the confusion, the cost was also very high to use the Tokyo Metro system, though I'm sure it was cheaper than using a taxi. However, in my two days sightseeing, I spent over $75 on myself alone for nothing more than trips on the metro lines. The costs must have been ridiculous for the families with multiple children that I saw using the metro frequently.In summary, the Tokyo metro is one of the better choices from a selection of bad options when it comes to getting around Tokyo. Prepare yourself for high prices, confusing route options with minimal English translations, multiple train operators that do not honor the other lines' tickets, and by all means keep a subway system map with you at all times."

The sheer number of lines and the need to buy specific transfer tickets makes it difficult. It is not always easy to transfer between the different lines and in the stations tje maps are often only in Japanese so be sure to pick up a paper English map.Having said that they are clean, fast and arrive very regularly.

If you're changing the line you have to check at a \"fare adjustment monitor\" if you have to adjust your ticket to change or exit the new station.Sometimes it is a little bit confusing since all the lines of the subway system belong to different companies (mainly 2: JR & Tokyo metro). So sometimes you have to purchase new tickets to reach a station since you're switching companies lines..wasn't really clear to me."

Hints for non-Japanese-speakers:Above the ticket machines there is a chart showing the fare to reach every other station. Find your fare, then buy a ticket for that amount. If you mess up, find the Fare Adjustment machine at your destination.Near the exits you will find street maps posted. Use these to locate the exit number closest to your destination. These maps are invaluable as some stations have more than a dozen exits to the street.Get an English-language map before you go. The Japanese maps don't include the station numbers.If you ever need a restroom in Tokyo, find a Metro station. There are also vendors and newsstands everywhere.Have no fear. This is an easy system to navigate."

We visited Tokyo for the first time in November 2012 - this was daunting as we are only English speakers so we were concerned about getting around on public transport. How wrong we were to be concerned! The spaghetti style maps of the Tokyo Metro system look confusing but in reality they are very simple to understand. Each Metro (subway) line is colour coded and each station has a reference number M7, C10, Z04 etc... Using the free hardcopy maps at most stations or internet maps you can easily figure out where you want to go and what line you need to use to get there - changing stations is easy and the lines are well signed. The only trick when buying a ticket is to remember to put your money in first and then select the fare amount not the other way around. Locals say to try and avoid the Metro in peak hours but we had no troubles. This is a great way to get around the city above."

There are two different companies with different networks of lines and they don't show each other's networks The JR map only shows the JR network. The Tokyo metro map shows the Tokyo Metro network and the airport lines. I looked online but could never find one consolidated map showing both JR and Tokyo Metro. You can use the Tokyo Metro trip planner to figure which of their lines to take to get to your destination, but be aware that there may be shorter ways to get there using a combination of both JR and Tokyo metro lines."

It it wonderful clean, trains run exactly on time, info is ample, coverage is great and it is very easy to use for non Japanese speakers. We were able to do all our travel on the Tokyo underground. Just buy a day pass for about US$ 10 and you are off. All signs are in English, there is contineous station info on the train in English and by giving each line a coulour and stations a number getting around is a breeze and thus you do not need to take a city tour. Exploring Tokyo on your own and at your own paste is so much more fun.And the Tokyo Metro is the perfect tool for that."

Added bonus, many of the stations have some cool stuff in addition to trains, such as food courts, shops, and even tourist attractions. Prices are low at around $1.50 per ride (or less if you buy a day or week pass, etc) and you can find bathroom facilities and vending machines for drinks and snacks at virtually every station.

            "review": "On the Tokyo subway with a wheelchair companion. My wife walks with the aid of crutches due to a decades-old spinal injury. We took along a foldable wheelchair for the later parts of the day when she got too tired to walk.We first attempted to navigate our way through the Tokyo subway by climbing down some steps at Shinjuku-Gyoenmae station on a Sunday morning. Upon reaching the ticketing area the ticket collector was most helpful and personally showed us to the platform. She asked if my wife needed to use the wheelchair but as it was early in the day she insisted that it was not required. The politeness was above the standard one could expect from public transport anywhere in the world. I supposed that since it was a Sunday perhaps she had fewer responsibilities to attend than on other days. We got to Meiji Jingumae station without too much difficulty and spent the day wandering around Harajuku and Omotaesando. The latter is often described as the Champs Elyssee of Tokyo. By late afternoon my wife started usin g the wheelchair. We then wandered to Yoyogi Park and boarded a subway at Harajuku station. After purchasing the tickets the person at the ticketing gate noticed my wife on her wheelchair and got out of his office to attend to us. He asked where we intended to go ;and led us to the elevators which were in an alcove behind the ticket barriers. Another official met us at this point. I noticed she had an aluminium board underneath her left arm. I wondered if it was some sort of ramp. She went down with us onto a basement level and took us to the platform. And \u201cyes\u201d she unfolded a ramp just in front of the train to enable me to push my wife\u2019s wheelchair onto the train without breaking stride. It was like being a visiting head of state. The gap from the train to the platform is only about 5 cm (2 inches) ;and on subway lines the normal trick is to reverse the wheelchair and push the bigger rear wheel onto the carriage first but of course with the ramp you can push the wheelchair passenger on to the train using the smaller front wheels. On board the train my wife joked that it would be really impressive if there was a ramp waiting for us at Shinjuku station. I rolled my eyes and thought to myself: Well you can live in hope. Lo and behold when we go to Shinjuku station there was a subway official waiting and he unfolded another ramp to allow me to push the wheelchair front wheel first. The official led us one of the station offices and said that someone would come to show us the way to which to catch the train back to Shinjuku-gyoenmae. He even apologised for the wait and explained that they were changing shifts at this time. After about 10 minutes another official came and led us to the platform for the Oedo Line and again he produced a ramp to help us get onto the train and at our destination there was an official waiting (we now realised that they were informed of which carriage and door we were on by walkie-talkie) with the ramp ready at the door of the train where we alighted. This wasn\u2019t the only time we got this amazing level of service. On Wednesday we took a train from Shibuya station to get to Shinjuku-sanchome. Shibuya is quite an old station. There are escalators going up but none leading down. My wife had to use the aid of a banister with one hand and a crutch on the other to get down one step at a time while I carried the wheelchair down the stairs. There were two flights of steps to negotiate. When we got to the ticketing area a security guard noticed us and took the initiative to contact the station staff. Again we were led from one point to another by subway officials and again they had the aluminium ramp on hand (this time it had a Velcro fastening). When the train got to Shinjuku station the doors opened and we could see a uniformed subway official with hat on unfolding a ramp to enable us to get off and resume our shopping expedition at the food hall of the Isetan department store. It was like Victorian clockwork. And the cost of our subway tickets? Yen 160 (about US$2.00). Only in Japan."

The cost is far more reasonable compared to other modes of transporation such as taxis. It is also very easy to figure out. Most of the signage in the majority of the stations is also in English with some exceptions. The station personnel are generally very helpful if you have questions. Some have better English skills than others but we have always been able to ultimately communicate. The coverage is fabulous as you can get most anywhere in the core area of Tokyo you need to go. There are also ample connections to the local trains for those areas out of reach of the Metro or for those routes that may be faster to get to by train. The facilities are clean and there are ample amenities such as vending available, especially in the larger stations. But the most striking feature of the Metro is the on-time performance which is superior to any other system I have used, including those in Europe. The one drawback is that it is indeed utilized by the local population and it can get very crowded. Avoid riding during the morning rush hour unless you want to get to know the people around you very intimately."

You don't need any Japanese to work it out and if you get lost you ask one of the many thousand rail officers. If the person you ask has no English understanding they will go out of the way to get you somebody who does speak English.The system is all worked out, as in England or France, with the various lines which have their own colour and the stations are all numbered in english numbers. You can get a free metro station map which has the lines and stations written in English and Japanese.You can buy individual tickets, but if you plan to use the metro for a few days then you should buy a PASMO card (which has 1000 yen worth of metro travel on it) from any ticket dispenser which is much better trip value for multi trips. You pay a small amount for getting the card which you get back when you cash it is at the large stations) If you need to top the card money you just put the card in the machine and press the english version of instructions and follow the prompts. Again if you have problems see one of the many rail people who are very helpfull.Overall the system is better than the metro in England, France and Spain. Give it a go as it is easy to work out which station you need and with all the good guide books (especially The Lonely Planet Japan guide) telling you which stations to get out at for the numerous attractions in Tokyo you will find it a breeze"
