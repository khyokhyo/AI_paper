The buildings, too are almost majestic, but on an ordinary day in early October, the cold wind blew fiercely and it felt like the Steppes of Central Asia. Even that was impressive. Groups gather at the column in the center to meet before tours, a freezing choice. Within one of the pictured green buildings is a new, decidedly unfinished museum (yes, built within the original structure) housing the recently \"revealed\" French impressionist paintings brought from Germany just after WWII. Fifty years in storage, they are now being shown, previously in traveling exhibitions, now in this truly inconvenient new space. Fewer than half of the collection are on exhibition currently."

It is believed to be Europe\u2019s largest public square. At the heart of the Square is the world\u2019s largest single-stone monolith, combined with a bronze angel statue to be 156 feet tall. Throngs of tourist and locals gather here, most to stand in endless lines for admission to Hermitage Museum, which I advise a guided tour and as soon as the doors open. In the afternoon, the crowds are unfathomable. Beware of pickpockets approaching tourists gawking at the magnificence of the two museums and the world\u2019s largest single-stone column. There\u2019s no cost to visit this site, so why not enjoy two impressive palaces and outdoor art?"

There were Peter and Catharina the Great walking around taking photos with tourists and making money, it's fine coz they didn't force you to take the photo with them anyway, plus they're quite friendly that you could even have a chat with them! The free walking tour also started here at the Alexander's column in the middle of the square. In midday, this square was spectacular and it's even more beautiful at night when all the light turned on. So try to be here at both time. :-)"

Massive open space in front of the Winter Palace (now the Hermitage museum) which was the official residence of the Czar's family. The Palace was built on the bank of the Neva River and is impressive from both view points. The square itself has a long history of protests, violence and grand demonstrations of power."

Standing in the Square and looking around you is a delight - the Winter Palace on a sunny day with the sun glinting off the golden crown is remarkable. But it is only when you apply the history to the things you are looking at, that the Square comes to life and bores into your soul. Read up on Russian history, or do a guided walking tour to fully appreciate."

Watch for Cinderella-like glass pumpkin shaped horse carriages in the plaza, and other lovely but slavery-worn steeds pulling more traditional period calash or coach vehicles. Depressed horses at least have each other's company in these situations, and they show it by nuzzling each other as humans ignore them."

Dvortsovaya Ploshad if the rough equivalent of Trafalgar Square in London or Tienemen Square in Beijing, but has few peers.The square sits centrally in St. Petersburg and is bounded by the Hermitage museum (and winter palace) and several other beautiful buildings. Architect Carlo Rossi designed both this square and the general staff building that now houses the Hermitage's outstanding impressionist art collection and has a magnificent arch leading out to Nevsky Prospect. A third side contains the beautiful admiralty building. You can see the spire of that building, as well as the more distant dome of St. Isaac's cathedral as you stand in the center. The huge column in the center is notable not only for its commemoration of Tsar Alexander I (who defeated Napoleon), but also because the huge pillar is held up only by gravity. Architecturally, this is one of the most impressive squares in the world.It is also steeped in history. It is, of course, the site of the tsars' winter palace. It was the intended site of the protests that ended in the \"Bloody Sunday\" of 1905. There is film footage of soldiers marching off to World War I from this very spot. The Bolsheviks took the winter palace from this spot in 1917.And it is still a vibrant hub. The square is full of people throughout most of the day and evening. Concerts are frequent. During our visit one Sunday night there was an elaborate free rock concert put on by the city (with lots of American music).If you are visiting St. Petersburg, you almost can't help traveling through here, but it's really just fun to soak in the energy and atmosphere on a nice day."

It is amazing how they made all the different architectural styles come together to make this interesting square. On the north side, you have the picturesque Baroque Winter Palace (built in 1754-62), then across the square, you have the classical yellow-and-white building of the former Imperial Army General Staff (built between 1819 and 1829 by the Italian architect Carlo Rossi). The building encircles the Southern side of the square where you find a central arch through which you can reach Nevsky Prospekt. On the eastern side the building of the former Royal Guards' General Staff tastefully closes the expanse of Palace Square, while on the West the square borders with the Admiralty and the Admiralty Garden. From here, you can see the gilded spire of the Admiralty and the dome of St Isaac's and the view westwards across the stone-clad expanse of Palace Square is quite breathtaking. In the middle of the square the Alexander Column creates an important focal point for this great architectural ensemble. The column in the center commemorates the Russian victory over Napoleon in 1812. Free"

With the beautiful Hermitage on one side and the curved Guards Corps Headquarters embracing the other sides, this monumental square is impressive. The center of the square is punctuated with Alexander Column, one of the tallest columns in the world, and the massive triumphal arch that blows through the Headquarters is cool too. The arch is topped with a quadriga; very dramatic but also looking like something Satin would drive to town in.Being a city-square-nerd I gave this five stars; it is one of my favorites. Maybe they are not your thing, but while you're at the Hermitage it will only take a moment to look."

We were lucky that there were spectacular summer concerts when we were there this July. Surprisingly, the singers sang mostly American/English songs. But after the concert, a group of young Russian started their own concert in this square and the public sang along. That made us discover the beautiful modern music of Russia."

Of course it's the most beautiful and famous place in Saint Petersburg, one of the biggest museums in the world. You can easily find out the information about its collection in the internet so i just want to share some informations that will help you visit the palace easier. If you just go to the palace through the main entrance, it'll take you 2 or 3 hours to wait to buy the ticket as you know everyone wants to visit it. So you have to go to the palace very soon, otherwise you can buy ticket online and i think it's better as you can go inside the museum through an other entrance that you don't have to wait."

Of course most people who come to Palace Square will want to go to the Hermitage but remember that the extraordinary collection of French Impressionist paintings has been relocated to the General Staff Building - the yellow and white building with the arch. Here the collection is sumptuously housed at last, in perfect conditions. Much less crowded than it was on the 3rd floor of the Hermitage; lots of air and space. Downstairs are reconstructed rooms and objets from the Hermitage storerooms. Extremely interesting and a pleasure to visit, if the dense crowds and vociferous guides in the Hermitage are a bit much."

The Plaza is huge and is the site of many of the official governmental ceremonies. The plaza is not quite as large as Red Square in Moscow and is about one-third the size of Tienanmen Square in Bejing. We were in St. Petersburg on the weekend of May 8 and 9, 2016 which is a big celebration in Russia, both in Moscow and St. Petersburg, commemorating Russia's defeat of the German Nazis by raising the Russian Flag over the Reichstag in Berlin at the end of WW II. The Russians celebrate their victories in WWII much more than the U.S. does, presumably because the Nazis invaded Russia and killed thousands of civilians and conducted a siege of St. Petersburg for 911 days and shelled the city every one of those days and essentially leveled it.Most of the notable buildings, palaces and monuments were restorations after WW II. When we were in the square before the parades, we saw the old-fashioned limos parked in the square ready for the parades. We also experienced the huge number of motorcycles in the plaza prior to the parade for the festivities. There is a monument column in the center of the plaza. You need to walk across the plaza to get to the other portions of the Hermitage Museum in the General Staff Building, which is a must-see."

The dressed up characters roam around the square and will offer to take pictures with you, using your camera. Just be advised that they will not let go easily. With a 200 rubles per shot/pose it quickly adds up. You have to be firm when you ask them to stop. There is a chance you could negotiate with them, but we just paid up."

That is the enormous square that connects the Nevsky Prospekt with Palace Bridge leading to Vasilievsky Island. We found ourselves in this cobblestones square, all surrounding with the breathtaking by their design, elegant features and monumentality, imperial buildings.It is a central city square of St.Petersburg and of the former Russian Empire. So many events through the history of Russia State took the place in this vast square, ending in the beginning of 20th century with the two events of the world significance, that are, the Bloody Sunday (1905) and the October Revolution of 1917. First that captures your sight is for sure the most celebrated building on the square, that is, the baroque white-and-azure ( I've never seen something like that in the world) Winter Palace of Russian tsars, that was built in the period 1754 - 1762. The palace with the decorative columns on the front facade, the high windows, the arched gates through the Palace, the range of the statues of the holy persones and rulers through the history of the world, on the roof of Palace, the central frontone on the top of building with the clock and the flag of Russia.Then across this enchanting edifice, there are the Neoclassical style buildings, which perfectly fit the Winter Palace in their scale, rhythm and monumentality. Here on the opposite side of the Palace, is most impressive the bow-shaped Empire- style Building, in which center is the double triumphal arch crowned with a Roman quadriga, i.e. the chariot with six horses and the soldiers beside of it.In the center of square as a tribute to the Russian victory over Napoleon is situated the colossal Alexander Column, the red granite column with the angel and a cross on the top of it.Nowadays, it is a perfect place for the open-air venue as the concerts and other happenings.Outstanding !!"

If you can come at daytime and then return at nighttime, all the better. Take a slow walk, look around - everything you see around you is an architecture masterpiece, and all of these together create an impression that will last. From here, either go to Nevsky and treat yourself to something nice in a nearby cafe or bar or go to the embankment and get a great panorama view of the heart of the city."

I rushed over to the Square, bought a delicious hot dog from a locl vendor, found that perfect little Russian Sailor Shirt for a little one, and enjoyed taking photos like a crazed photographer with carte blanche to do photo shoots. The weather was perfect (but it was raining heavily and now the next day -- so I planned the timing to be here to a tee). I am still looking at my photos -- and there one more surprise -- if you turn a 360 degree turn and see the old Square with the Arch (opposite of the Palace), and you will see a momument on top that may make you think of Berlin."

Don't go until you know that history, then stand there and let it flow through you."

On the opposite side, a yellow and white building with a big arch, designed by Carlo Rossi (1819-1829) it's the Building of the General Staff. The eastern side is covered by Alessandro Brullo's building of the Guards Corps Headquarters (1837\u201343). The western side is open towards Admiralty square.

There's often concerts, events, gatherings, military band practice (that's a doozie if you get the opportunity to see it) and much, much more going on here. My kids used to take rollerblading classes here!! What a location. If it's got a slight dusting of snow in early winter, it looks like someone sprinkled sugar on it. Fabulous. The views from all directions are wonderful so take heaps of pics but watch out for Peter the Great and Catherine roaming around, waiting for unsuspecting tourists.

It is also when skateboarders move in to take full use of its wide, open spaces.

The Arch is sorrounded on each side the Buildings of the General Staff and the Guard Corps Headquarters and to its front the iconic and famous Winter Palace. Set in the middle is the overpowering Alexander Column rising 47.5 meters to commerate the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. After the line had gone into the Winter Palace the Square looked vast and imposing with just a few tourist carriages and actors in period costume touting for a picture shoot. Very different from Bloody Sunday in 1905 when tens of thousands of protesting workers and their families were mowed down by volleys from the Imperial Guard and other troops and the storming of the Palace by the Bolsheviks in the October revolution of 1917.

In the centre features the statue of a hero in Russia, Peter the Great! Then on one side to the northwest, is the Hermitage Museum/Winter Palace, then the other side the Art Institute of Petersburg which many of the finest artists of Russia were born! You can also find occasionally some locals dressed up as the czar/czarina, red coat soldiers who you can take photos with for merely 150-200 rubles...cheap and sexy)"

Before and around the sides of The Hermitage are the cart vendors for souvenirs and novelties - as well as entertainers and coffee/drink vendors. The size is immense - use panoramic view when taking photos. When I went through in the morning, reenactment characters were also present for photo ops. At night, local police are present as I noticed last night walking around 11 pm. The square was filled with lively people."

This is close to being the very heart and soul of the city, lacking only the presence of water that is such an indispensible feature of St. Petersburg. There is very little that is Russian about it, not surprising since it was designed by an Italian in the 3rd decade of the 19th Cent. It is immense in both its size and its grandeur. The North side is composed of the baroque splendor of the Winter Palace (Hermitage Museum) that shields it from a view of the River Neva. The South comprises the neoclassical Imperial Army General Staff Building, crescent in shape, and incorporating at its centre a Double Triumphal Arch that leads through to Nevsky Prospekt. The Eastern side is occupied by the Royal Guards General Staff Building that, like the previously-mentioned edifice, is now given over to Government offices. To the West lies the Admiralty Building (now a Naval College) with its attractive gardens alongside. In the centre, a tall monument celebrates Russia\u2019s ultimate victory in the Napoleonic Wars. Ironically, it was designed by a French architect and stands more than 150 ft. tall. Although it is topped by an angel, it is known as the Alexander Column after Tsar Alexander 1 who, as everyone knows, defeated the French Armies single-handedly! Despite its popularity, its sheer immensity ensures that this vast square never seems to be overcrowded."

(For the time being, Picasso and other early modernist European works remain less impressively displayed within the Hermitage.) The stunning Matisse works are located on the top floor if the General Staff Building and serve presently as a kick-off for a more contemporary display of installation-type art, which is innovative and good of its kind. Most Russian modernist works are now part of the collection of the so-called Russian Museum nearer Nevsky Prospect, a revelation in their own right when seen together in their present well-lit recent display there.The Twenty-First Century Museum in the General Staff Building is completely uncrowded.

You will spend 3 minutes here at most, taking photos of yourself in front of the Winter Palace - that's all there is to say about it."

In my humble opinion this beautifully designed plaza is not only impressive because of its grandeur but also because of its elegant clean architectural lines. It easily rivals St. Peter's Square in Rome and possibly Place De La Concorde in Paris - go early in the morning (or if you happen to go in the off-season) and you will be awestruck by the square's magnificence. To me this square is what St. Petersburg is all about - historically and artistically."

It's just a massive square, but the buildings surrounding it make it a brilliant spot to take photos of the city, plus it's also close to the river, so really, it's excellent for a photo op or to see many soldiers in uniform if that's your thing...I'm guessing that in the summer months, it would be packed with street stalls and thousands of tourists, but in winter, it's very slippery due to the ice/snow build up. It's really empty during the winter months though."

En route to a guided tour of the Hermitage Museum was struck by the absolute beauty of Palace Square.To say the least it is simply a magnificent plaza that enjoys not just a breathtaking occupation of space but the beauty of the buildings surrounding the plaza itself are gorgeous.I enjoyed reading up on the history of this part of St Petersburg when I returned to the USA. In my opinion it's a definite must-see just to enjoy the overwhelming use of space and, of course, to enjoy the historical architecture that surrounds you!I recommend having a comfortable pair of walking shoes and to take approximately an hour to 75 minutes to walk around and embrace the beauty of this part of SPB."

Palace Square is a magnificwent space bounded on one side by the winter palace and on two others with large formal government office buildings and open to the street on the fourth. It gives a sense of the power of the czars and the anger and resentment it generated leading to the aborted revolution of 1905 and that of 1917 which lead to the overthrow of the imperial government. This square was the epicenter of both. Thousands fought and many died on this square. When you are in the Hermitage in some great gilt hall and looking down onto the square from a lofty height and behind 5 foot thick walls you can get a sense as to how easy it would be for a czar to be arrogant and feel impregnible."

You can visit this famous museum and then take a speed boat to Peterhof to enjoy the Summer palace and its fountains. But don't try to do it all in one day - too much. Spend a day on Palace Square and Hermitage and another day in Peterhof. Enjoy!"

A huge space and it must be one of the largest squares in the world. Surrounded by beautiful neoclassical buildings in every direction and overlooked by the Winter Palace, this is a majestic place. With a lovely triumphal arch on one side and the excellent Alexander Column in the centre, this is macho Russian stuff on a grand scale. The Alexander Column is the tallest granite column in the world and was so well cut, that it stands without any attachment. At some 500 tons, it would take some moving. The square is a statement of the power and wealth of Russia and it does it very well. If you have the space, the vision and the cash, this is the way to build a square - simply superb."

I was in essence, going along for the ride, not having had any feelings one way or another about visiting Russia. That first early morning we stood in Palace Square, it was fairly quiet being a Bank Holiday, the sun was shining and we both just stood looking round. My husband just couldn't believe he was actually there in that square he had read so much about. The history that unfolded there and the architecture itself of the Winter Palace and the other buildings, just exuded an almost tangible atmosphere. It was far bigger than either or us had imagined. His dream had come true and at that moment I too was hooked on this very fascinating and enigmatic country."
