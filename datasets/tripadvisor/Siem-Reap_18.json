My tour guide would have skipped this had I shown no interest, but I am so glad I insisted - I stayed for 40 minutes and could have stayed for an hour. Saturated in beautiful temples and tasty food it can be hard to contend with Cambodia's recent chaotic and traumatic past. This is a small museum, consisting of a small group of thematic rooms surrounding a kiosk full of examples of munitions from the Vietnam War through to the period of the Khmer Rouge. It provides an inflinching and disturbing look at landmines, their role in the war, how they are made and how they kill and maim, brought up-to-date with descriptions of present international movements to end the production and distribution of landmines. The English audio tour (free with admission) was excellent."

Very sobering to read some of the stories about victims and see the work which is being done by various countries and charities to try and clear the landmines from Cambodia. The American tour guide was fantastic and provided some great insight into the details. The site also houses a school for poor, sick or orphaned children and provides housing, food and education (most students go onto university or trades).The money from the ticket goes directly towards helping clear landmines, raise awareness and support the children facilities."

Founded by a former Khmer Rouge child-soldier, who was ordered to lay the mines, later turning around and committing his life to removing the millions of landmines spread around Cambodia by various armed forces.I will not dwell into the history, it can be found in various documents and movies on-line (and is - obviously - presented in the Landmine Museum itself).I will write what you will see in the museum.First of all - you will see thousands of mines in all sizes, colors and shapes, from all the possible producers worldwide.Secondly - you will see what these mines do to people. Ugly.Thirdly - you will see the history of people who committed their lives to get rid of the landmine threat.The museum has just a few rooms (5?), there are some worn audio guides provided (2 of 3 I tried did not work).I definitely recommend the museum. It is humble, but very authentic and allows tourists to better understand the past and the presence of Cambodia, which is far more than good hotels and cheap entertainment easy to find in Siem Reap."

Its part of the deal and I would consider it offensive if you didn't learn a little history. This museum was great. You got to see actual landmines and the real human cost of war. We always hear numbers on TV and they are easy to disregard (I do it too) but the see images of actual innocent children with limbs blown off by landmines puts a human face on it. The guide's father was killed by the Khmer Rouge. Everyone who visits Siem Reap needs to go here. Not recommended for little children though."

This is a very small museum packed with defused ordnance,it's possible to walk around in 5 to 10 minutes,but listen to the free audio and read all the wall posters and it's easy to spend 1+ hours there. Some form of photo id is required for loan of audio and headset.Diagrams of various mines and which countries make and supply them i found interesting. Aki Ra the founder is a very brave man having defused thousands of mines, i keep thinking of the audio when he says \"Never touch a land mine.\" long pause then \"Never ever touch a landmine\" his voice says it all. There is map of Vietnan/Cambodia covered in red dots, each dot is a bomb drop by B52s,incredible, it's a wonder any body survived.A very interesting place, well worth a visit.How some people complain about a $5 entry fee is beyond me as it all goes to a good cause."

The efforts of one man in particular are nothing short of heroic, and the vision he inspires others to share are very moving. It's hard to come here and not feel awe. The children that this effort supports are proof of what one person can do to change the world. The exhibits are clearly marked in both English and Cambodian, and some are also in French. All of the items are genuine, and the stories behind each compelling. Highly recommended way to spend an hour or two, plus the gift shop supports the orphanage with a number of the items for sale actually being made by the children...worth a visit for sure."

There are still an estimated 3-6million that are still out there. The museum has an audio tour available and it gives details and explains things clearly, my 10 year old was able to understand things well. It was a real eye opener and gave a greater understanding of the suffering faced by the Cambodian people. They run a school as well, and are on the look out for donations school supplies etc.. You may consider taking some things along. Highly recommend you visit, and take your kids along. They may not get too many details of the various bombings and the struggles but at least they will come away with growing sense of empathy. "

So best not to be confused and do a bit better planning and trip advicer. .advice) as many notes on this trip advicer site is wrong and not for this place...Its mostly a personal tour.. with extra head sets if needed.. there are heaps of writtern up signs and history info..war stuff by the heaps.. I took my time to read it all. .plus there is about a 30 minute veido that is well worth taking the time to watch... there is a kids centre out back which is not open to tourist to disrupt them every 10 minutes.. for personal selfies..(which wont to make yourself feel better??)..YOU CAN MAKE FURTHER donations to clearing more land and even just but a T shirt which has a price factored in to clear more land..If your organised bring with you tooth brushes and cleaning paste ..soap.. kids thongs ..pens pencils .. any kids stuff..and donate it to the guy in the office at the entry or leave it with the girls at the fees entry box.. From what I can see the NGOs and Aid groups and red cross have instructed them not to let tourist interract with the kids any more as it's not good in the long term for this uncontrolled interaction that affects the kids to think every touriest has to give them something..all the time.1.Best to make a day trip is my advice.2. leave town very early in the morning stop off at 3 butterfly farm ..4 many interest road side sellers..along the way.. than this 5 XMO..was musium. .than go down the road to more 6 quieter temples.. and 7 more street farm sellers.. and return which every way you plan.. a full tuk tuk day trip. ..Heaps off interesting places to eat and buy cold drinks and fresh cocunut all the way...have a good day ..well worth the extra day to see."

The audio explanations are excellent.I am glad I visited this place for the insightful information about a tragic time in Cambodian history."

I do not mean \"obsessive\" in a bad way. \"Aki Ra\", the founder's adopted name, established his unique museum of war weaponry, including landmines, to show the world the horrors of war; war that he experienced himself as a child and, then, adult soldier for, amongst other governments, the infamous Khmer Rouge.The museum itself deserves a good hour, or longer if you wish to read the texts scattered around the buildings.Equally important is Aki Ra's orphanage and school, off limits to the casual visitor, behind the Museum itself.Aki Ra no longer clear landmines himself, but supports those who do. Is there work left to do? Yes!Cambodian Mine Action Centre (CMAC) estimates that there a re between four and six million landmines and unexploded ordinance in Cambodia today. Yes, 4 to 6 million!For those with an ironic sense of humour (probably like Aki Ra himself), you can buy soap in the shape of a landmine in the Museum's gift shop: a unique gift.People normally take in the Landmine Museum on the way to or from some of the other temples outside the main Angkor Wat archaeological area."

Under the relief center it said that if you were visiting there was a wish list for the children so we went shopping and brought toothbrushes, pens, pencils, combs etc to take out for the children. It is quite a way out and a bit rough in a tuk tuk. On arrival it cost 5.00US to get in each which is expensive for Cambodia entrance fees. The girl at the front desk appeared not to speak English, which is fine, but that doesn't mean she cant look up at us and at least smile or acknowledge us, we nearly left then.We were totally underwhelmed by the place, it was small and rundown, there is no argument that the work that Aki Ra has done in clearing landmines is fantastic but the museum actually lets his good work down.My husbands audio headphones didn't work so he took them back to the girl at the entrance who was now asleep and didn't seem happy she was woken, she swapped the headphones but put the ones that didn't work back on the shelf for the next person. There were plenty of donation boxes in this small museum that consisted of 4 tiny rooms and I did see a wish list on the wall but nowhere that encouraged us to leave the items we brought, it seemed money was more what they wanted.I understand that the orphanage is the children's home and that it is not appropriate for tourists to be visiting the children but I did think that we possibly could have visited part of the orphanage to see the work that is being done for the children and learn about the lives of these children without interrupted the kids (as the websites says when you visit the relief center). I did read on a sign that all children go on to do a trade or study at university but where were the stories about what these individuals have achieved. While I was standing there Bill from the relief center came out of the museum and I was standing at the gate by the relief center reading the sign, I smiled at him hoping to make conversation and thinking maybe he would stop and talk and I could pass on our supplies we had brought but he rudely ignored me and brushed passed and open the gate through to the orphanage without so much of any acknowledgement. I thought he was totally rude especially when they are wanting support from visitors. We then went in to the room where they were selling paintings to make money and the women in there couldn't even look up so we left and took the supplies we brought with us.I felt this place actually gave a bad reputation of orphanages in Cambodia and a lot of work is needed to make this museum enjoyable."

It's quite a way outside of Siem Reap city, but the tuk-tuk ride in the breeze was lovely! When we arrived, we were shocked to find that all of the ordnance collected was the work of ONE man! There must be tens of thousands of pieces, mostly different sorts of landmine. You learn a lot about this man, Akira (nicknamed so by the Japanese but a Cambodian former child-soldier) and his history mirrors the history of Cambodia. I was shocked to learn that Cambodia was carpet-bombed during the Vietnam War purely because Ho Chi Minh used the country to boost his supply line in Vietnam. What's worse, is the sheer amount of landmines left buried and live all over Cambodia. Anyway, you don't need to hear the tales from me, you need to visit the museum and hear them yourself, as well as see what war does.It is 100% worth visiting this museum."

The story of the man who began the museum, Aki Ra (originally when he took it upon himself to begin removing landmines) is very inspiring. It also feels good to know that the entrance fee you pay goes towards removing more land mines and improving the lives of the people in the area.

Firstly, the landmine museum has a few small rooms and a yard area with a few posters. The rooms contained a lot of information about the Cambodian War against the Khmer Rouge, with quite a lot of insight from the founder Aki Ra as he participated in the war fighting for the Khmer Rouge, Vietnamese army and Cambodian national army. A lot of fascinating stories were shared and a lot was learnt. The posters in the yard displayed stories of people from different countries, how they saved others despite their differences.  Secondly, a lot of landmines, uxos and bombshells were displayed, also some weapons and a bomb disarming suit. There were a large variety of all of these. There were also a landmine simulation and some art constructed with weapons. Thirdly, it was very inspiring to see what Aki Ra was doing and how he was contributing to the society. I pay huge respect to him. Though he hurt a lot of people with landmines he planted, he is now helping a lot of unfortunate children whom are in need. Reading all the messages written by the children to Aki Ra really allowed me to understand how much heart Aki Ra has given to help these children, how badly the children's situations were and how much their lifes have changed after they were brought to the museum. I would definitely recommend others to visit this museum. Unfortunately, I didn't use the audio guide which means I might have missed out. It's worthy of your time and really help with the understanding of the landmine situation and the history of the war."

This is a small but informative museum created by former child soldier Aki Ra who fought for the Khmer Rouge from age 5 after they killed his parents. He later defected to the Vietnamese army and has since spent many years performing very dangerous job of clearing landmines. He is estimated to have cleared over 50,000 land mines and pieces of unexploded ordnance and this museum houses a few thousand of these (fully deactivated - don't panic!). Millions of landmines still scatter areas of Cambodia, leaving thousand of adults and children severely injured, and this museum explains why clearing them is such a difficult task. Aki Ra has also set up a free school for children affected by landmines. In one of the rooms you can read their touching stories, in their own words, on how they came to live at the school, what their life is like now, and what they hope for the future. The museum is a little out the way but I learned a lot from my visit and recommend spending an hour or so here."

The museum was itself small, the entrance fee was 5 dollars, but most of it goes to living of children that had suffered from land mines. They had a audio guide, which was very well spoken by a USA man, who I believe lives in the museum.

It is well laid out and is very informative of what happened in the war, how this has affected Cambodian people and how it will affect them in the future. The entrance to this museum is about GBP 2 and goes towards helping the Cambodian people incapacitated from landmines and removing remaining landmines. I would recommend this to all visitors to gain an insight into the history but to also help the people, especially when the entrance fee is so low. I take my hat off to the people who remove and destroy these landmines."

I kind of had an idea about landmines in Cambodia but I realised very quickly how little I knew once stepping into the museum. Its a pretty no-frills affair but that should not, and does not, detract from the depth of important information the museum shares. The museum essentially tells the story of one man's efforts to get rid of landmines and provides the contextual information relating to the Khmer Rouge, US bombings, etc. The entrance fee of 10usd goes towards helping those affected by landmines, as does the proceeds from the gift shop."

I would highly recommend visiting both in the late afternoon, as a nice (and less crowded) way to end the day. We were at the museum from about 3:30pm to 4:30pm and were the only ones there, then headed to Banteay Srei from 4:45pm to 5:30pm and only saw about 15 other people at the temples.

Having passed part of the vast Angkor Complex, we continued through rural countryside which for me was an \"eye-opener\" to see how villagers live. On arrival I found a small, but comprehensive museum founded by Aki Ra as a charitable organisation. He decided to help his countrymen by defusing land mines, knowledge he gained during the Pol Pot regime. It is not a highly professional museum however the charitable efforts do convey the horrors of land mines which still occur to this day in parts of rural Cambodia. Exhibition rooms housing ordnance, clothing and photographs along with two outside static displays, radiate from a central gazebo which houses a vast collection of assorted land mines defused by Aki Ra. One of the static displays shows small anti-personnel mines connected by trip wires hidden in foliage which highlights the danger of wandering off into the jungle to this day.The small entrance fee of $5 includes a multi-lingual audio headset. Behind the museum is a Relief Centre where child victims of land mines are housed and fed along with education at local schools and universities. There is a small souvenir shop where some products and a collection of original paintings all made by the children are on sale.The entrance fee, sales of souvenirs and other donations go to the relief work. You will either like or dislike your experience but I found it a fascinating but sad reminder of times under Pol Pot. Not really ideal for children."

After the war, he converted into a hero and since the nineties, because of his acquired explosive and TNT handle technique, he has dedicated his life to make his country a safer place by finding and disarming thousands of thousands of landmines.  The museum shows his work, his life, pictures and stories of mutilated child and older people and examples of landmines such as those lethal ones made by the soviet and chinese armies and used by the khmer rouge. The legacy of this silent job is priceless and was recognized worldwide. Today, there are still thousands of active landmines at the cambodian territory and nobody certainly know how much and exactly where they are. Specially in the country side, hundreds of people still suffer accidents and get hurt, wounded, dead or mutated by landmines. Very recomended to get to know this story."

And there are over 30,000 of the mines (defused and certified safe) on display in the museum. On the bright side is the story of the man who started the museum who, after being a child soldier for the Khmer Rouge, made it his mission to clear tens of thousands of these deadly weapons. Not only that, but he takes in orphans and amputees and provides them with a home, an education, prosthetic limbs, and hope for the future. The displays may be low-budget, but they touch your heart.

As their mission had made great impact on the numbers of land mines, so lessening (but not eradicating) the number of victims, still their work continues,not only in clearing, but in supporting and educating the next generation of children in need.

When planning the trip, I asked our driver to include this on the itinerary. A generation after the war, people still are maimed and killed by mines and other unexploded ordinance (UXO). Terrible but shouldn't be surprising since bombs and shells from WWII and even occasionally WWI are found in fields and cities of Europe today. The museum is run by an NGO started by a former Khmer Rouge Child soldier, Aki Ra, who taught himself how to disarm landmines. It has a few rooms with exhibits on mines, shells, and the history of the war. The most moving exhibit for me was one of the simplest - the small pavilion in the courtyard enclosed by metal mesh and containing piles of deactivated landmines, shells and other weaponry. The museum also has a school on the premises to help children who were injured by landmines learn job skills and enter the work force. The children designed the faces and figures of life-sized mannequins dressed in the uniforms of the various combatants involved in the Cambodia Civil War. Highly recommend making time to see this extraordinary museum."

The asian/indian tourists and me [American who isn't white] were just ignored. Stood there for 15min next to him listening to his lecture and reading the material on the wall and he didn't even say hello. There is a bunch of rusty landmines and bombs from the vietnam era on display. Didnt find it very interesting. They need to present it better.

ONLY recently three villagers and a buffalo died when they triggered a landmine.The chilling thing about this whole situation is that there are still millions of mines lying out there, all capable of maiming or killing, enough to give one mine to every living person in Cambodia.So I was very interested to learn more about what is being done to find and deal with this explosive legacy of civil war and made a point of making a trip out to the Cambodia Landmine Museum.A little kiosk was open to take my $5 for an entry ticket when I arrived and I was immediately struck by a poster next to a row of ordnance lining the entryway.It said: \u201cCambodian Self Help Demining is an all Khymer NGO established in 2008 to clear small villages throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia. CSHG is comprised of ex-child soldiers, widows, mothers, fathers, villagers and university graduates all working together to make their country a safer place for all.\u201dYou can\u2019t help but be affected by such a message, particularly as the civil war concerned was years ago but its terrible aftermath is still blighting lives.I was in quite a grim mood as I walked in to be halted in my tracks by a huge container full of mines and munitions in the middle of a water display.Other rooms and displays also showed mines, how they are used, hidden and the devastating effect they have. There are also audio guide headphones available.The museum, which includes toilets and a souvenir section where you can actually buy a defused mine, was founded by Aki Ra, a former child soldier with the Khymer Rouge.It was originally at a different site and has now moved to its current facility where it cares for dozens of children.Aki Ra says he must have laid thousands of mines himself, the clock turning full circle because he is now credited with clearing more than 50,000 mines.The loss of life caused by mines is on an unimaginable scale, but clearance, community help projects and this museum are all doing what they can to tackle the mine legacy. A really worthwhile place to visit and support."

Aiki Ra is a great guy who set about demining Cambodia after the war, and this museum is a tribute and testament to his hard work which still continues. You learn a lot about landmines, and the war and see displays of all the deactivated mines and bombs they have found. Also on site is an orphanage and childrens school and centre, but you are not allowed visit this out of respect for the children.

Despite the terrible reality of landmines and the good done shown in the museum, my experience here was very poor indeed.

I could see the audio guide headphones but no guides and nobody to ask. All of the rooms off the central display (with all the landmines displayed) were locked with padlocks. There was one woman half heartedly \"cleaning\" (moving dirt from one place to another) and we gestured about the lock and just pointed and was obviously annoyed by us. Eventually one man came in and just shook the lock a few times and pushed the door and the disappeared without saying anything.

Orphaned by the Khmer rouge at the age of five, they made him a child soldier at ten. He defected to the Vietnamese army in his mid teens, and later served in the Cambodian army as well. When the civil war finally ended he used his expertise with laying land mines to begin single handedly dismantling them. The story goes on from there."

Not appropriate behaviour when they should have been helpful, showing me around and instead of ignoring me. I emailed their management. It's a really really worthy cause and I would have donated extra above the entry price, but I was too irritated. Having completed my rant. It's worth a look if you have the time and interest.

We added it to our full day Bantea Srei/Kulen Mountain/Beng Mealea tour. Ticket sales go towards maintaining the centre and supporting landmine victimsWe got there at around 9am and it was really\u00a0quiet and peaceful with just us there, which gave us a chance to easily read through all of the exhibits.Aki Ra the founder tells his amazing life story as a child soldier for the\u00a0Khmer Rouge before devoting his life to removing landmines throughout Cambodia and caring for young landmine victims. It's equal parts sad and inspiring to see the work of Aki and his team - highly recommended."

If you have enjoyed the UXO Museum in Luang Prabang, Laos, you will appreciate a stop at this small but great museum, where you can learn about a sad side of the Cambodian History and have a broader view besides the ancient ruins and temples.You can ask your tuk tuk to take you there while coming back from Banteay Srei temple, as it is on the way to Siem Reap. There are about four rooms, but there is a lot to read and it is all very well explained. If you are nerdish, you can easily spend 1 or 2 hours there in reading the explanations or in listening to Bill Morse's stories.We were very lucky to meet Bill at the Museum and this made our visit special. He is a former US Army soldier, and retired teacher and business man. Bill has helped Aki Ra, an ex-Khmer Rouge soldier, in the demining work and he is helping in running the Museum and the project behind, which also includes teaching to orphans with his wife Jill."

Granted the museum is not large but you need to remember that is museum is not run by a large corporation or local government. This museum is a great example of less is more. The audio guide is well worth a listen. One reviewer commented that the museum was anti american. I didn't see this at all and in fact throughout my stay in Cambodia this was not apparent. It did suprise me as after visiting the museum I did some research and discovered that the USA dropped 2.5 million tones of bombs on Cambodia for four years without congresses approval. Nixon gave the order and it was done in secret. Consider that 1.5 million tons where dropped on Europe by the allies and shows the extent of the bombing here. I would thoroughly recommend this museum because despite it's size it is very worthwhile. If you walk around it will take 5 mins BUT if you really visit the museum and read the description and listen to the audio guide you will need 45mins to an hour. In summary it's a must do (as is the War museum in Siem Reap), they are both worth a visit."

The story of the curator is sad and after buying a book in the shop on site about the children of the killing fields and their true stories under the rule of the Khmer Rouge it helps you understand much more what the people of Cambodia went through and what some are still going through even now. 1 USD to make and lay one landmine, 1000 USD to find one now and disarm it, just think about it. On the whole make the effort to come to this museum and see what mines are really like. "

His story is amazing, and when I left the museum I felt amazed at what hes accomplished and shocked at how most people will not know of him.Removing the amount of landmines so far has taken many years and a lot of hard work and sadly they still have a long way to go.

As I was walking arou GD the museum, it was such a moving and emotional experience to see my donated parcel being taken to the school for poor primary students and orphans who are taught in an adjacent property to the museum.

The landmines are well presented and really hit home while the stories of the 18 or so children they help to support, although not related to the mines, are great and give an insight into the growing young cambodian society.A big plus was meeting Bill, an american who now works at the museum and for the foundation full time, and giving us a first hand idea of what the quest to rid the countgry of land mines entails. Having been to Phnom Penh and the killing fields/S21 this tied in nicely but if you're only going to Siem Reap then this is a must to visit to understand the country and its brutal recent past.

So many places in Cambodia and Vietnam encourage you to visit schools where the children have there study time disrupted by well wishing tourists the kids 'perform' for the tourist.....yuk.

It is particularly worthwhile taking time to read the essays of children who have been hurt touching mines in the country, or who are now staying at the centre associated with the NGO. Moving without being gory it is also ok to bring children inside."

The museum gives a history of the battles of the khmer rouge and an understanding of how and why they fought.

The museum also provides an education for under privileged children. make sure you leave enough time to get the whole story. we only had 30 mins in a packed agenda and i would have happily stayed for a lot longer"

Carpet bombing 60,000 target zones with 120 bombs dropped on each target, not to mention over 4 million land mines still not cleared: 1 in 300 Cambodians are a victim of land mines. The charity here at the museum have set up a school and living arrangements for children orphaned or abandoned in the area. They give them somewhere to live, they give them schooling, and at the end of it everyone gets a university scholarship. The founder Aki Ra, began dismantling land mines by hand years ago and spearheaded the missions to rid the K5 belt and beyond, it's resulted in a major decline in Landmine accidents, deaths and amputations. What they are doing at the centre and all of the volunteers there is amazing and moving. And to Bill, thanks for arranging the audio tour and what you and your wife have done is commendable. Really makes you appreciate how lucky we all are!"

It is fairly unassuming and if you didn't know it was there you'd probably pass it without noticing. On entering the museum you are bombarded with information from pictures, letters, newspaper cuttings, posters, old land mines and diffused bombs. There are audio guides available in English which help you to condense some of what you can see and these are very informative and helpful. Learning about the Khmer Rouge and the fascinating story of the museum's founder Aki Ra who used to plant the land mines as a Khmer Rouge soldier and now removes mines all over Cambodia, really brought it all to life. It really is shocking when you realise that land mines are still killing and wounding people, usually children and farmers, across Cambodia. Aki Ra adopted children who were either themselves victims of land mine accidents or orphaned in the same way. There are now numerous orphans and disadvantaged children who live at the centre, receiving an education and a much more prosperous chance in life. Tickets are only $5 and it is nice to know your money is being put to good use, providing a liveable wage to the staff who work there, an education and better quality of life to the orphans at the site and more importantly saving lives and limbs through contributing to the funding of land mine removal in Cambodia. This is well worth a visit if you are in Siem Reap."

I am horrified to see that anyone has written negative reviews of this museum considering what it represents for the local people. This place represents one mans struggle to help support the local people of Cambodian get better education and also educate us on the atrocities of land mines. Yes it's not a new large westernised building but that's part of its charm. This place is an hours drive out of the city, and the photos are slightly old but it's the information and the story behind this that is what makes this so worth while. If someone goes around it in 10 mins they aren't reading the information properly. It took us an hour and it was really educAtional. What this guy has done and dedicates his life too is inspirational. all proceeds go to the children who have been victims of landmines or whose families have been victims and they support the children and educate them in the place behind the museum. This is the second time I've been here and I will keep going back and supporting it. One note, they have a wish list for the children on the board as you walk in which we wish we had known about - I've attached a picture - things like pencils, shampoo etc for donations so if you go it's worth taking some of these things with you."

It's a small charity run museum (so don't expect some polished commercial museum selling cappachino and ice-creams in cafe on the way out) but it is very well run. And the fact that it isn't commercial, adds to the impact of the place. Simple, clear and sobering. Not humanity's finest moment. Whilst I was there, nobody spoke - they seemed deep in the own thoughts, listening to the free audio guides and just trying to take it all in. Aki Ra, the founder of the museum, de-miner and next door school for landmine injured and disadvantaged children deserves Nobel prize for what he has done here. You should also watch a video at the end - all shot on a handheld cam with thought-provoking cutting between filming Aki Ra as he finds and deactivates landmines with no more than a stick and pair of pliers, the tortured history of Cambodia and the smile of little local children playing football or on a rope swing over a river - kind of puts your own life into perspective"

Sadly we had an afternoon flight out so could not stop but there were some handicraft stalls and sugar cane areas that would have been good for a short stop en route. This is a small museum which aims to inform about land mines, the way they were used in Cambodia, the work being done to clear them and also about the children that the money raised here provides to look after local children that either have been orphaned or who can not be looked after by their parents. Take the time to read some of their letters, they are truly humbling. It does not cost much for admission, $5 I think but please, if you can, donate more either in cash or take things with you, on their notice board it said they needed - soap, hand sanitiser, pens, pencils, tooth brushes, tooth paste as well as other items that I can not remember now.

This is the result of the efforts of an exceptional local man, who not only continues with mine clearance but has also established and maintains an orphanage - all without international funding. The story is worth the visit alone, and the nominal entry fee contributes to the ongoing effort. Every trip to this area should include a visit to this unassuming and quiet effort to make Cambodia a safer and better place."

The trip takes approximately 50 minutes by Tuktuk and takes you through the countryside and small villages. Once there you witness unexploded ordnances in the driveway! The entrance fee is 5$. The money ensures the staff a reasonable wage, runs an orphanage and supports the struggle against land mines. Inside the museum you will be offered a free audio guide (very informative). Posters in English are explaining the history of land mines, the consequences of the land mines, essays from victims and the struggle to remove the mines. The museum runs an orphanage for handicapped children and victims to the mines. Visitors are encouraged to bring toys, balls, pencils, toothbrushes etc. The museum is run as an NGO that seems genuinely sympathetic. Highly recommended."

In fact, if you explore the Ankor area you will find some warnings not to stray off the path since there are still some areas with active mines. It's not a very big museum and it will only take you an hour or so to see everything but the story of Aki Ra is an impressive one. In addition to his story having cleared over 50,000 mines and UXO's (unexploded ordinances) you will find many of them at this museum (explosives removed of course). The cost is only US$5 and of this only $3 of that goes to paying the staff."

This museum is small but it is also genuine and features the work of someone who selflessly had attempted to clear landmines for years with a knife, a stick, his intelligence and determination. If it were a movie, it would be unbelievable, but as is the case with many things in Cambodia, it is too bizarre to not be true. I wish there was more info on the present clearing team. There was tonnes of articulate and grim information on the past and present challenges on mines today in Cambodia. It infuriates me that these maiming devices are still produced and used so strategically around the world. Can we not do better in 2015? For those that complained that the museum is 'small' and perhaps not as slick as they wanted, I wonder what they think about the rest of the country: They might be better off watching NatGeo or going to the MOMA. The money from the museum goes to support a school and various projects versus propping up a pseudo democratic dictatorship, cronies thereof, or foreign corporate interests. I agree it is not glossy but it is a best effort, quite good actually, at educating people of non-glossy realities.Worth it and has a very low cost. Saw several staff around that appeared to be the actual Khmer mineclearers. Allow yourself 30 min to an hour,"

It was very sobering and grounding.It was wonderful to hear the great work the museum's founder has been doing removing landmines from Cambodia. We thought our $5 entry fee was well worth it. Kids 12 and under are free -- but I would have happily paid.Of the $5, $1 goes towards efforts clearing landmines, $1 goes towards support programs in local villages and $3 is used to support the children who live at the museum, as well as paying the staff a fair salary.It's open every day from 7:30am-5:30pm.

Since all of the sites are further out, I hired a sedan for the trip. Besides the sites, the longer trip outside gave me a chance to see some of the countryside especially since I was advised the water levels were too low to see the villages. I thought the landmine museum was a valuable experience both for the opportunity to see some of he difficult history of land mines in Cambodia (and many other countries) as well as to support the amazing efforts going on there. The museum is self-guided and consists of four small rooms which have maps and diagrams of land mines. In all it takes 15-30 min to see. Well worth it."

It is located to the north-east of Angkor Wat, 7km south of the Banteay Srey Temple and about 45mins drive away from city area. Would recommend taking a car instead - I took a motorcycle and was under the hot sun, faced with dusty roads and a ride filled with bumps.It was really an emotional experience for me, I could really feel the sufferings that Cambodians are going through even till now - landmines are still a real threat in this present day. The negative parts:1) the museum is not exactly big - just about 4 rooms around a middle showcase of ordnance (as shown in the picture).2) the children's center/home behind is not open to public - I can understand their rational that the children are not exhibits and all, but perhaps good to show some photos of the center? We can then see the kind of lifestyle they are having.3) distance - it is really very far away from town. However there are 2 attractions nearby for one to consider as well: Butterfly Center and Banteay Srey temple. Entrance fees $5 will be well spent by them to help fellow Cambodians. Thanks Aki Ra for your heart of gold!"

Touring through this museum (you pay $5 to enter), you gain a further apreciationg for the Cambodian people, particularly Aki Ra who rightly won the CNN Hero award in 2010. The situation of the millions of live mines still planted in the Cambodian country side garnered the attention of Princess Diana and her HALO initiative. Aki and his team (including and American couple) have made it their life work to demine the countryside. They are humble, hardworking and put their own lives at risk every day to make Cambodia safer. They have also established a refuge for children who are victims of the mines, to date over 30 children reside there and are schooled and given an opportunity to hope for a brighter future. Simply playing in the fields leads many to loose arms and legs. Please take your time going through the museum, buy a gift (proceeds to towards furthering their efforts), and make sure to leave a donation. Again, give wherever you can."

This museum now funds the life of up to 20 mine damaged children and for this reason alone it is a must to visit. Your dollars will help these children. I spent at least 2 hours here and was very pleased I did. It is a gentle stroll around the exhibits and accessible to all. Do go, its interesting, educational, a great story of one mans traumatic life and you will be helping the children."

The $5 ticket goes towards continued deactivation operations throughout Cambodia and the care of bomb victims who live behind the property.If you're fortunate enough to have a guide, the experience is no doubt better than going without - but you can still navigate and learn on your own."

However, after visiting the place, I was bemused by those TA reviews about this place. Firstly, the whole museum is tiny, only 4 rooms exhibiting the same stuff. Secondly, while the exhibits were well curated, the theme was more about the troubled past of Cambodia than about land mines. Thirdly, and perhaps the most disturbing to me was that the fact the founder of the museum was once a defector who had fought along side the Vietnamese army. In some of the explanatory placards in the museum, he proudly proclaimed to be a marksman and would normally be able gun down his own fellow Cambodians during the war. While I am not Cambodian, I definitely would not encourage anyone to support someone who would join foreigners and turn the gun barrel on his own people. By visiting the museum and paying the USD5, you will be indirectly supporting a person who had such a dubious history."

I knew this was a problem, but the magnitude of the problem is still so much larger than I realized. This is also the site of a residence and school (and glad to report that visitors can't visit this). A good museum both educates and makes you feel emotion and this did both; I still think about this now we are home in Canada.In regards to location, we didn't realize how far out of Siem Reap it was by Tuk Tuk, but we enjoyed the ride through small villages and fields. There is also another temple to visit along the way."

The day we were there, an English speaking guide was on (American chap) and his passion for the whole project really brought the place to life. I don't think there are always guides available though so maybe double check before you go if that is important to you. Price went up in last few months and is now $5 but given it all goes back into the museum and the centre for children it is well worth it. If you have the time at all would recommend a visit here, to learn more about landmines and the effect of unexploded ordnance on a society, even after war has ended... Something that is an issue worldwide not just in Cambodia and will be for decades to come unless more money is devoted globally to de-mining activities."

A tuk tuk ride away, this homage to one man's determination to rid Cambodia of landmines - some of which he laid as a young soldier - is a sobering reminder of Cambodia's recent struggles and the daily toll it places upon the people - 15 people a month still falling victim to unexploded ordinance. It's not a neat and tidy, clean and well-organised museum trip we'd expect in the west, and that's not a criticism. It is what it is. Managing on a shoestring and volunteers, linking humbly their experiences with the Holocaust, Bosnia and Rwanda, it's well worth a visit, especially if, like us, you have teenage children."

I had no idea that Cambodia had been covered in these awful land mines (a truly evil weapon designed only go maim people, not to kill them) and that over 100 people a year are STILL being injured by them in Cambodia. What wonderful work this man has done clearing so many of them from all over the country and taking in those who have been injured. We should all visit and take note and contemplate the costs of war to civilians."

I recommend going there by tuk tuk; you feel more \u201clocal\u201d (but wear sun glasses to block the wind and dust from your eyes), going past fields, small villages and road side stands.

Good place to visit and learn about the history & current realities for Cambodian people in relation to landmines and the struggle to disarm them. The fantastic efforts made by local people to rid their country of these devastating war machines shines through through the information shared.It's amazing how many still lay fully armed in Cambodia!"

Impressive museum that helped us in our understanding of the why, what and how of this terrible wapon (in Cambodia). We have seen how the founder Aki Ra and all the people involved, help the local community. The story of the founder Aki Ra is inspiring. Somewere he explains that as a kid soldier he had to install landmines. They were his friends since landmines kept him save. He thought so then. After the war was over, he desided to clear landmines himself.. In 2010 CNN rewarded him \"Top 10 CNN Hero\".With your visit you contribute to this good work. Helping to free Cambodia of landmines and the orphanage & school for (landmine victims) kids."

While basic, the museum has some facts and figures on display on the issue of land mines in Cambodia. There was also a self-guide folder which I found really handy as it gave me more of an insight as to the issue and what's being done now. The weapons on display are pretty good too, no/minimal firearms, just lots of different mines and bombs. If you're into ordinances and weaponry, you should definitely come. It's great to see this place also helping victims of land mines too. Some of the artwork in the souvenir shop was pretty good I must say. The only real complaint from me was housekeeping. The place looks like it could do with a good spring clean! It is a museum after all."

A good insight into history of American carpet bombings of Cambodia in the times of Vietnam war, data on death toll of civilians, info about current efforts to remove still active mines from Cambodia - it's all there and is a must see lesson of our recent history. However, what was the most interesting and giving hope for a better tomorrow after learning again how cruel place a world can be, was the personal story of Aki Ra, the owner of the museum, who used to be a forced kid soldier for Khmer Rouge, then changed sides to fight them and finally dedicated his life to free Cambodia of landmines and unexploited ordnance. The museum is half an hour drive from Siem Reap, but a definitely worth one - we enjoyed it much more than all the temples. By visiting and paying the entry fee, you also support two good causes: 1) the effort to free Cambodia of landmines and 2) orphanage & school for kids who are landmine victims."

Enough is here in this museum to unnerve the majority but if you visit Cambodia I feel that you must visit these places if you are to understand the country that you are in and traveling around.Entry is a minimal fee considering you can walk in to a place whose history is partly about people who now can't walk.The guides here are very helpful and very explanatory of the museums purpose to educate all visitors through its doors."

The story of the museums founder who himself had been a member of the Khmer Rouge from the age of 10 and then defected to the Vietnamese Army as both a child and adult was inspiring.

As you can imagine, all the ordinance on display are rusted having been recovered from rural Cambodia, however the shear volume of items gives you a glimpse into the scope of the problem. There is a 'fake' mine field containing decommisioned ordinance in a non-displaycase style of presentation which also gives you a feel for the dangers that still lie out there waiting for some poor person to discover them.There is rehabilitation centre for child land mine victims out the back, however tourists are not permitted to go back there. I found that rule incredibly noble as I would hate to see those kids exploited in order to generate more tourist dollars.The Muesum is a good 30minutes from Siem Reap by tuk tuk so take bottled water and be sure to make the most of the trip by doing other things along the way."

They lock up land that could otherwise be used productively. And the legacy of amputees and other injured victims continues.The landmine museum was started by a former Khmer Rouge child soldier who had laid plenty of mines himself. He wanted this part of Cambodia\u2019s story told. The organisation he founded is also active in demining, and supporting children who have been affected by landmines or are otherwise at risk.A fascinating visit, and a very worthwhile organisation.

It went up $2 just recently. it is about 45minutes by car from Siem Reap.The museum is only small, however the information and what it has to give is great. The visit was greatly improved by the resident guide, Bill. Bill is from the USA and has been with the organisation for some 11 years and as such was able to provide a realistic picture of this huge Worlwide problem.The museum and its income supports the clearing of land mines and building and staffing of schools in villages.Keep up the great work."

Down-to-earth, sincere and effortlessly engaging on a very important subject close to his heart.Obviously landmines are a dark and horrific topic, but the people involved in this project are an incredible inspiration, must visit!"

The museum is a 45-60 minute tuk-tuk ride outside of Siem Reap (but can be combined with a visit to Banteay Srei temple about 6km away - also the trip out to the museum was also a nice way to see some of the countryside). The museum is informative and worth the $5 cost of admission (of which $1 is used to continue to clear mines, $1 is used for educational programs in villages, and $3 is used to pay staff, support children made orphans by land mines, and pay for rehab of land mine victims). The museum includes examples of mines, mortars, guns, and weaponry from the Cambodian civil war. Interpretive information is in English (and other languages are available as well). Allow approximately 1 hour to view the exhibits and read the information here. Be advised that the museum is indoor/outdoor and while the indoor portion has fans, it is not air-conditioned."

The story of Aki Ra is very moving in itself, but what he has done with the Landmine Museum and setting up a home and school for at-risk and landmine affected children is inspirational. We walked around and read the information in each room and when we were finished we happened upon a tour that was just starting, being led by an American man who was one of the staff (Bill I think?). This was a great tour because we got to hear some personal stories and some information that put the landmine issue in Cambodia and across the world into perspective. Very interesting - I think these tours may run each afternoon. It is a small museum but has the right amount of information and artefacts on display. We came away feeling like we had a better understanding of the impact of landmines on Cambodia and its people. There is also a shop on the premises selling some clothes and other items that have been made by individuals with disabilities which is worth a look. This is an amazing place to visit and even if we hadn't already been riding out there it would have been worth the trip."

We were there on Saturday and apparently there is no tour guide but as long as you can read English, my husband and I actually enjoyed walking through and reading on our own. It was shocking to know how many casualties and injuries have happened since the war, especially in children, and scary to know how many armed mines and bombs are still out there, especially in this region.

You don't hear about it day to day here, at all, to the huge credit of the Camdodians - and there is no family it would not have touched. The museum serves the history and the human cost in a very tangible way. The trip there and back (the museum is 45 mins outta town) is worth it (especially on a tuk tuk) for its sheer beauty & insight into Cambodian village life. Do not hesitate - DO IT!!

He answered all our questions and his clear passion for the topic was very engaging. The museum was well laid out to tell the story with a guide but it's not obvious how it flows if you're looking at it by yourself. If it wasn't for Bill I would have just been looking at remnants of war and not added much to my knowledge. I'm not sure if it's possible, but it may be worth while ringing ahead to check if a guide will be present, all the negative reviews that I've read generally refer to people wandering around the museum with out a guide and therefore not getting much out of it."

The museum displayed all types of landmines and bombs found in Cambodia and also displayed a beautiful photo exhibit of heroes who rescued people in their respective circumstances (holocaust, Rwanda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, etc.).

It's small outdoor museum, founded by Aka Rai and run by war survivors. Aka Rai was a child soldier and knows the insight of the terrible war in Cambodia before and during Pol Pot's reign, having 'finished off' about 5000 landmines and still doing more. A very brave person that has become not only a Cambodian hero. The museum shows lots of pictures and gives a really good overview. It's located on the way to or from Banteay Srey and really a must see. All money and donation go towards the after-war-cause. If you plan a visit, take along soap, hand sanitized, pens/pencil, not paper, etc. These are things that were listed on their wish list on the whiteboard!"

The Landmine Museum is a must-see for anyone who wants to understand what happened to the Cambodian people in the past and how it influences what is happening now. You can spend an hour or several hours depending on how much detail you want to read about the nature of the land mines. The museum focuses on the work of one of CNN's Heroes, Aki Ra, who has led the demining activity in Cambodia. The current lives of many Cambodians cannot be understood without knowing how the presence of land mines affects their daily lives. There is also an orphanage on site caring for children whose lives have been directly affected by land mines. The school and living environment cannot be visited as this is their home and is completely separate from the Museum. You can take a self-guided tour with the appropriate folder in your language. Please consult Landmine Museum for a list of items you can bring to benefit the children. I left knowing so much more about the current work being done in this country and elsewhere in the world affected by land mine devastation and the brave and heartfelt efforts of people involved in demining."

Given the travel distance from Siem Reap and the rest of the temples, this is a nice pairing. And given how well preserved Banteay Srei is, it seems foolish to miss it.The Cambodian Landmine Museum is well done although it doesn't have any high tech installations. Mostly large photos and graphics with text explanations. Actually, I think there is a video in one of the rooms that we missed.The ravages of war continue to have a profound and lasting impact on Cambodia. The museum puts some of that history in context which was very helpful for us. It also shows the impact of millions landmines as well as unexploded bombs from the US.

Tens of thousands would be alive today in Cambodia who are not, perhaps hundreds of thousands.

We arrived as a guided tour was about to start (around 9am) and it was excellent, a gentleman from the USA conducted the tour and his summary of the Vietnam (American) War, Khmer Rouge, landmines (past and present situation both in Cambodia and beyond), Aki Ra, the local founder's story (ex child solder) was excellent. I learnt so much in my one hour that I spent there. I thought the approach to the children who lived there was very ethical and it was interesting (and frustrating) to hear how little western governments care about the ongoing problem of land mines."

Opened from 7.30 am until 5.30 pm. A humble museum , built by Aki Ra , a former soldier who used to clean landmines scattered all over Cambodia , with help from his wife ,sadly deceased by illness.The story and history about Cambodia, the Museum and the Khmer Rouge was told by Bill a US citizen, a volunteer ,whose already relocated to Cambodia.The Museum consists of 4 galleries , and a home for 27 children, most of them are victims of the landmines.In one of the gallery ,we can watch the method of Aki Ra , defusing some Land Mines.A sad story of war , evil practice of human kind in the name of war, and the aftermath of war now still continues for the Cambodians.Worth to be visited !"

Hire a Tuk Tuk driver for the morning and plan on stopping at some nice places, along the lake, for lunch on the way back (buy the driver lunch too) The Landmine Museum itself is a rather sad commentary on human nature from the carpet bombings by the USA to the subsequent rise of the Khmer Rouge it can be enlightening. To this day Cambodians are maimed or killed by undetonated explosives. You would think in todays high tech world it would be an easily solved problem.It has been awhile since I visited ( I was not active with Tripadvisor then) but I think there is a small fee for foreigners and Khmer get free entry.

We couldn't afford another days entry to temples so visited the museum alone and were not disappointed.The journey was a pleasant 45min tuk tuk ride and the museum itself was an extremely informative experience.

The Cambodia landmine museum was founded by Mr. Aki Ra. Inside the museum, there is a poster says:\"TOURISTS DO YOU KNOW...? That the Kingdom of Cambodia counts more than 45000 landmines victims, every month 120 new victims, 5 dollars to purchase a mine 500 to clear and destroy one mine.ALL OVER THE WORLD 100 to 200 million mines are laid and activated today! TOURISTS WHERE DO YOU TRAVEL TOMORROW...? to Angola?Afghanistan?Bosnia?Mozambique?Today 52 countries are mined!ONCE YOU ARE BACK IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY PLEASE HELP TO flight against this curse created by human,he production and use of mines world wide.Think about victims and deminers....\"While you are visiting the great Angkor Wat, please do not forget those innocent people who were killed by war..."

You'll see the literally thousands of mines deactivated around Cambodia. You'll see the man-sized bombs US B-52s dropped around the Cambodian countryside. You'll learn about the sad and depressing Khmer Rouge period. Admission is only 2USD but you can contribute more since they support landmine victims around Cambodia.

This was an incredibly sobering experience and I did end up becoming emotional - understandably so. These people went through hell and back and the amount of landmines what were displayed were shocking. The saddest thing is that there are still more that are still to be found around Cambodia. The museum are undertaking charitable work to help improve the lives of those who continue to be affected from the wars that have torn this country apart (i.e. injuries due to landmines). The founder of the museum had found and deactivated 100s of not 1000s of landmines and continues to undertake this work - a lot of these can be seen at the museum. It is a small and simple museum but there was a lot of information, with personal stories.Despite the sadness I felt by being at this museum, I would recommend a visit because if it was not for the founder of this place, a trip to Siem Reap would not be as possible or safe to undertake."

For two reasons- the place is very informative especially if you are lucky enough to get a guided tour from Bill Morse (who IS American not maybe Canadian) and secondly because you are supporting a great cause.I am astounded at how people feel they have been \"ripped off\" paying 3 dollars knowing full well their money is going a long way to help eradicate a very serious problem. You would have to be very naive to only spend 15 minutes in this place, I was in there with my girlfriend for over an hour and a half and would have liked to have stayed longer.The tour given by Bill was very informative, not just on landmines but on the bigger picture of Cambodia itself. I kept quiet about my background, I work in EOD myself so I am well educated in mines, explosives and ammunition in general (and the injuries they can cause). I was quite surprised at how knowledgeable Bill was at the more intricate details. If for some reason a tour isn't available, there are guide booklets you can walk around with, there is plenty to see. People need to realise that these items don't just become magically safe, each and every one of the items you see as you walk around has been made safe with a large amount of risk and danger involved. If you feel like there isn't enough to see- by all means get down on your front and start prodding, see how many you can retrieve from the ground. I would hope my point has been made, this place is very interesting and just by paying your 3 dollar entrance fee you are helping fund a very good cause."

The reason I gave this 5 stars was because I left here amazed and inspired. Aki Ra was a child soldier, then turned his life around and took on a crusade to start de-mining Cambodia. He started de-mining using only a stick and leatherman tool, which is simply mind-boggling to me. To see the work he has done and how much good he and his small team are accomplishing is well worth the trip. A gift shop and opportunities for further donations (beyond just the price of admission) are available on-site, as well. Please go and support the great work Aki Ra and his team are doing!"

It was then only $3 to get in and that goes towards the great work they do clearing landmines on Cambodia and supporting children and adults who have been affected by landmines. They actually house victims and educate them on the site but you cannot access this, and rightly so to allow them privacy and to live without constant tourists coming in. The museum is quite small but it is very educational and emotive. The story of the founder and his late wife is truly inspiring. I hope they continue to get enough resources and support to carry on an amazing job and eradicate their fantastic country of landmines.Well done Cambodian Landmine Museum!"

I hail from one of those \"most landmine-contaminated countries\" on the list, and I really wanted my teenage children to see it in order to better understand the human condition as a consequence of war, as well as learn about Cambodian history. Besides the personal story of Aki Ra and his work on de-mining and helping out children-victims of landmines, as well as information on mines, mortars and other weaponry used during the civil war, the museum features materials related to history of Khmer Rouge terror rule and genocide of Cambodian people. The visual elements are well combined with non-visual ones. Photographic exhibition of limbless victims is particularly shocking, but very tastefully organized and exhibited. Small museum shop offers a collection of souvenirs, museum logo t-shirts, children's drawings and books and provides a visitor with an opportunity to support its work by purchase or donation. Definitely recommend for anyone willing to go beyond the usual sight-seeing experience and learn more about Cambodian history and the perseverance, bravery and optimism of its people."

I didn't want to hear about how people lost limbs and all that sad stuff, but it is important and I was admittedly very impressed with the whole experience. My kids (age 8 and 5) were absolutely mesmerized by Mr. Morse during the entire visit.We were lucky when we arrived that the Museum Director, Bill Morse, was actually providing the Tours. I learned an incredible amount about the land mines, how many are still out there (how many are live and still dangerous), and was very impressed both by what the organization is doing and the sphere of influence they have. They employ about 30 people to disarm land mines, and are continuing to work to return farmland to the people. They also help children that have been injured by a land mine. They can come to the organization, be provided a home and education. They have continued on and children harmed by land mines are also provided a scholarship to go to university. Our experience was absolutely wonderful, and this is due fully to the fact that Mr. Morse provided the tour. Thank you for the wonderful experience and I hope your organization will continue to grow. My recommendation is, please go see the museum. Learn what they are doing to return the land to people, and drop a huge donation when you leave. The actual admission fee is only $3, so I am sure you can leave a bit more!"

We were lucky enough to get here in time to hear Bill Morse give a tour. I think roaming about looking at the displays and reading the stories wouldn't have been so rich in emotion if it wasn't for him.It's amazing to see the vim behind the group of people who dedicate their time to demining Cambodia on such little funding so please go and spend your $3 and then spend some more in the gift shop or donate to this amazing work."

This museum may not be the biggest, but they do big work for Cambodian people and you can learn about these efforts in great detail upon your visit. Attached to the museum is an orphanage/home for children disabled by landmines or whose parents were lost in a landmine accident. You are not permitted to interact ( which is a good thing) as this home offers them the opportunity for a stable and normal life including education and future scholarships for university. During our visit at the museum, an expat de-miner was present and was offering help along the tour and interesting anecdotes. The museum is a ways out of town ( roughly 45 mins), so it is best to make the visit while doing other activities in the area, such as Banteay Srei, the butterfly museum, and even the shooting range if your feeling adventurous. Consider bringing donations when you visit. They had a message board saying that they needed things like Cambodian books for the children, blank journals for writing, toiletries, etc..

We also requested that the gift shop attendee play a video for us (recommended by our guide Sun Same), on the work of the museum's founder Aki Ra, a man who has successfully disarmed thousands and mines. I think it was the video that the organization submitted to CNN for its application on behalf of Mr. Ra for CNN's annual hero of the year award, which Mr. Ra won as a top 10 hero in 2010. The musuem also provides a nice contrast to the temples if you are feeling a little templed-out."

He was conscripted into the Vietnamese army on threat of his life while still a boy. He later served with the Cambodian army as a teenager and still later received landmine clearance training with the United Nations.Having laid thousands of landmines as a soldier and working for the UN to remove them he discovered he was quite adept at clearing landmines and UXOs, and decided to make it his trade.Having no demining tools, he used a knife, a Leatherman, and a stick. He would defuse the landmines and UXOs he found in small villages and bring home the empty casings. Sometimes he would sell them as scrap to help fund his work.Tourists began hearing stories about a young Khmer man who cleared landmines with a stick and had a house full of defused ordnance. Aki Ra began charging a dollar to see his collection, using the money to help further his activities. Thus began the Cambodia Landmine Museum.Aki Ra cleared landmines where he had fought, when he heard about an accident, or when village chiefs and farmers would call him at the museum and tell him of mines in their villages and ask for his help.While working in these villages he found many injured and abandoned children. He brought them home to live with him and his wife Hourt. Some of the children who moved to their home were also street kids from Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. Eventually he had brought home over 2 dozen boys and girls.The first child Aki Ra brought home was a 9-year old boy who had lost his leg to a landmine and was living on the street. His wife Hourt had no idea Aki Ra would be returning with the little boy, but when he returned home she took the child to her family and said \"Look, now I have a son\"."

After years of fighting he returned to the villages in which he planted thousands of mines and began removing them, by hand, and defusing them with homemade tools. In 2008 he established a formal demining NGO, Cambodian Self Help Demining (CSHD) - a separate NGO from the Museum, which clears landmines in small villages throughout the country.The Museum hosts a Relief Facility for at-risk village children. The money raised by the museum allows this facility to continue. At the present time (late 2012) the Museum supports a community of nearly 75 men, women, and children.This is a small museum, but definitely worth a visit, especially if you are going to Banteay Srei. It's on the way and only $3 donation to visit. Not only is it informative and interesting, it is very inspiring to see how one man has faught to make his country a better place and how one man can make a difference."

The group still de-mining areas are doing such a great job. Can't help but do a donation whilst there."

Our travel tour guide for Siem Reap (Sopheap Prem) asked if we wanted to stop at the museum after our out of town visit to Lady Temple. We thought 'why not', and we were really glad we did. This NGO is run by Aki Ra, a self-taught de-miner, who, barely more than a boy, was forced to lay the mines as a Vietnamese conscript. After seeing the damage caused by these awful tools of war, it became his mission to rid his country of all land mines. He has personally destroyed about 50,000 of them. We were lucky enough to have an ex-US army sergeant who now works for the organisation visiting at the time, and got a personal tour of the museum. His commentary and the answers he gave to our many questions made this visit extremely interesting. There are still millions of land mines in Cambodia to find and destroy. Their mission is not to de-mine the land as much as release farming lands back to the people so they can eke out a living."

What you see is a well-documented display of land mines and their effects - in all their horror and obscenity. What struck me most was how sordid the whole business is - to think that governments are still manufacturing these devices and businesses are still making money from them.I had also expected displays of victims and wounds. There were almost none. There was absolutely nothing self-indulgent or self-pitying. This museum does not dwell on the past. Its real purpose is to focus on the future, and on how to tackle to enduring danger of the mines.I found the museum a chastening and inspiring experience, and I would like to record my admiration for the founder and wish him well in his work."

We first visited in 2006 when the museum was very simple, just a corrugated iron building, some rickety sheds plus open air eating and sleeping quarters. This museum has now moved and is located on the road to Banteay Srey. \u00a0As a young child Aki parents were killed and he spent years in various armies, fighting with the Khmer Rouge, then against them. One thing he learnt all about was Mines.In 1993 Aki worked with the UN clearing mines, this was a good time in his life as he also had the opportunity to go to school and study, so life took a turn for the better. Once the UN left, Aki kept clearing mines and amassing a huge collection of guns, bombs, mines etc. This collection is now the Cambodia Land Mine Museum.  \u00a0\u00a0Aki and his wife Hourt have 2 sons, they also have a small group of children who are land mine victims living with them. The children are supported and sent to school by the Museum. Sadly Hourt died on April 14th 2009, she was only 28 years old.There is now a small charge to see the museum and a small shop there where you can buy drinks, books, T Shirts etc but I do not think it was a good as the original museum which had a lot more displays and less text information."

However, what we did see and learn gave us a fascinating insight into Cambodian history and what the Cambodian people have had to endure over such a long period of time. We found the displays very informative and have complete admiration for the guy (a former child soldier) who set up this museum and has also had so much involvement in de-mining Cambodia.

It's not the biggest or most impressive museum you will visit, but it does a great job in setting the chronological scene of how so many landmines came to be in Cambodia and what is being done to clear them, and how that is being done.We combined our visit with a visit to the Bantaey Srei temple and spent about 40 minutes at the museum. Both visits together make it a lovely half day tour from Siem ReapThe drive out to this part of the country from Siem Reap is really quite scenic, making you think even more about the awful unnecessary destruction landmines can cause to so many innocent individuals. Equally, many of those unfortunate individuals live in a country where medical facilities and care costs money that most people don't have... I am priviliged to live in a society where the majority of us are able to freely roam around our local countryside without the concern of being injured through no fault of our own. A visit to this museum with it's small entrance fee of just a few dollars helps them to continue their charitable cause to rid Cambodia of landmines. It's all about the gesture, rather than how \"impressive\" the museum is. I also bought a very pretty, good quality scarf from their on-site shop for a very reasonable $3 to further support their cause. The little shop sells t-shirts, purses, scarves etcThey are doing an amazing job, long may it continue with everyone's support."

When you go, make sure you pick up one of the free laminated guides available in the first room. This gives you much more information and context. However, it is a good distance into the park so I was glad we combined it with visits to the lady temple and river carvings."

That doesn't make it any less compelling. There is very interesting artwork done by the children who had been affected that blew me away.

I went with my daughter but there was nothing I could use to safely engage her with information without scaring her to death! I think educating kids about mines and explosives needs doing, but there was nothing I could see that was targeting children's education there. The price of admission was fine and worth it (good cause too). The shop was pretty poor and small, I bought a few items but would have bought more if there were more choices. Finally all of the staff were indeed excellent, smart, friendly and approachable. If anything the people here make the place worthwhile. Overall pretty average, especially on the education front. As a kid I played near mines and saw a few up close and had a few close calls so I know the need for education at a museum like this!"

You will learn a lot about land mines and other munitions that have had such a huge impact on the people of Cambodia, and the extraordinary efforts to demine the nation. The story of its founder, Aki Ra, is inspiring and really quite extraordinary. To visit, you need at least 30 minutes, but 45-60 is best in part so you can watch at least some of the video. Definitely worth a visit."

Each gallery is well set out and there are ample film / slide shows on hand to enhance your experince with a range of language options.It's a bit expencive if your staying at the Angkoriana you can save a dollar but purchasing your ticket there."

The very touching story is about the founder Aki-ra who has made an effort to have built this small museum with the help of a Canadian NGO. Cambodia's leaders previously opposed this site. It's quite a distance from downtown, an hour travel by tuk2. By car i think will only get about 25-30 minutes. But the trip is worth it with a $3/person entrance fee.

Behind the museum is a school that caters to disabled children. The museum is a bit haphazard in its layout, with likely too much reading for most visitors. However, there is one room with stories written by some of the children at the school, which are emotionally powerful and worth a read.Overall, this museum is worth a visit and it makes you realize that amidst all the beauty of the temples and friendliness of the Khmer people, there is recent and sometimes overlooked tragedy that has and continues to effect some people in this beautiful land."

Plus, we were very fortunate to have met the main man behind it- Mr. Aki Ra (I believe he was one of CNN'S hero's of 2010). We arrived just shortly after closing; however, our drive/guide persuaded them to open the museum for us. There is a display of various types of mines, and an in depth explanation of the work Aki Ra has done in the past, and continues to do. I was informed that he had just recently returned from Korea, where he had received an award. It is a small museum, so I imagine if you just want to go for a \"quick look,\" you might be disappointed. However, if you go and look, and read all the literature, I am certain you will find this museum a very, very, educational experience. After visiting this museum, in the jungle areas of Cambodia, I decided to stick to the trails rather than being possibly killed by some one-dollar device.Truly a must see, especially if you are coming back from Banteay Srei-the donation helps so many in need."

We learned a lot from the 45 minutes or so we spent there. Particularly in comparison to other museums in Cambodia, this one is surprisingly well-done and really worth your time. It's also right on the road to Banteay Srey, and so makes for an easy stop either before or after seeing the temple.The museum is also affiliated with an orphanage that Aki Ra now runs, and some of the older children work in the museum. This seems to have upset some visitors, but I found it an appropriate merging of interests. Contrary to other reports, we experienced no pressure whatsoever to offer a donation (beyond the minimal entrance free to the museum)."

Landmines are a plague and unlike others who tried to come up with solutions, he took it upon himself to personally deal with landmines by doing nothing less than going out with a stick and a pocket knife and digging them up. He has personally removed tens of thousands. He then went on to found an orphanage for victims and more. He is quiet. He does not do it for fame or fortune. He lives modestly and stays out of the spotlight, preferring to be in the field removing mines. There are videos and stories about Aki Ra online. He was a 2010 CNN \"Hero.\" He was featured in National Geographic in 2012. Etc. One man, a stick, a pocket knife and 50,000 fewer landmines. Their motto is \"One mine - one life\" for a reason.

We heard from a few of them that \"there's nothing much to be seen there\". It's true that the museum is very small but it's the story behind it and the work they do for the community that counts.Also, it's a shame that you don't really get to see signs in Siem Reap pointing you to the museum or guides telling you about this place. It's more common to see the War Museum. You don't need a temple pass to visit and the museum entrance fee is very low.Do not miss the opportunity to travel through countryside villages and to know about the war and the amazing work they still do clearing landmines in Cambodia. You can also read the stories of the kids who have been injured by landmines and are know currently living at the house behind the museum.

Never have a felt better paying to get into somewhere, the ticket is a mere 2 dollars US but you know it is going to a good cause. A MUST see if you are in Cambodia, its small from the outside but the impact it will have will last a life time."

Our trusty tuk tuk driver Mr Than suggested we visit this place. we are not too much into war but he pointed out that landmines were a part of everyday life now some 15 years since the last were laid in his community.We spent about an hour and read all the interpretation panels which were very informative.I all came to reality later that afternoon - our Tuk Tuk driver took us for a walk in the jungle to a rarely visited ruin. It was so peaceful and we were well relaxed when the ground shook and he heard a loud explosion. He just kept walking while we stopped and asked. It was just another land mine being exploded. It was followed a minute later by another explosion.Land mines are being detonated dialy - some on purpose - others continue to maim and kill."

After spending a day touring Angkor Wat and the temples nearby, we took a 45 minute tuk tuk ride out to Banteay Srey, which we probably wouldn't have done except that the Cambodia Landmine Museum was on the way. After spending the entire previous day learning about and seeing some magnificent temples, Banteay Srey was interesting but couldn't compare. However, the Landmine Museum made the journey entirely worthwhile. Watching the video of the history of landmines in Cambodia was somber yet fascinating to learn about, and viewing the relatively small but powerful exhibits was an eye-opening experience that shouldn't be missed by anyone who visits Siem Reap. The Landmine Museum is only about 30 minutes from the heart of Siem Reap, but if you go there you might as well go see Banteay Srey as well, if for no other reason than the landscape and the people that you'll see along the road is somewhat different from Siem Reap. Also, for only USD20 per day plus another USD15 for the tuk tuk driver plus tips, I'd highly recommend a guide even for this day--and definitely for the day at Angkor Wat--just to hear firsthand all about the Cambodian people and their culture."

This museum is about a 45 minute tuktuk ride (cost us $18 return) outside of Siem Reap, but that in itself was very interesting and nice to see everyday Cambodian life. It only costs $1 to get in and all funds raised are used, not only for the upkeep of the museum, but also to look after and educate children whose lives have been affected by landmines. I would advise you to watch the video first and then go into the different rooms to see the collection of landmines. You can easily spend about an hour at the museum and it is well worth the effort and time and very educational into the bargain. Highly recommend."

This is a small museum that is privately owned and is dedicated to distributing information about landmines and the harm that they can do. The owner, formally a member of the Khymer Rogue, became an expert at laying mines and is now one at finding and removing them. The museum contains just about every type of landmine that you can name with pictures of people maimed by them. It has artillery shells from various countries and a stack of military gear on a table in one room of the museum. Admission is $1 but it's worth a lot more to tour this museum."

We had hoped to learn so much more about the work going on and the current state of play in Cambodia, but it just appeared to state general opposition to landmines world wide. Rather short of content. This was a surprise given the external support which the musuem has. An opportunity missed (unlike at Tuong Slay in Phnom Pehn) Visit if passing the door, but not worth a special trip.This is a comment on the museum, and not the wonderful work they do, but it could be so much more influential and informative than it was."

The museum might be small, but the explaination of the landmines and the stories of the victims have been life enriching. Pls. note that the museum has shifted and is now situated to inside the Angkor park, and you will need the temple pass to visit it. The best approach is to do it on your return trip from Banteay Srei. There is a 1 USD/ person for the entrance."

They have all the different types of landmines, posters with stories of people who have lost limbs to a landmine, as well as a deactivated test field.To correct the previous post, a donation of $2 will clear 3 mines (based on Aki's team of 32 who earn $30 a month and all the supplies they need). Please either make a donation, buy a shirt, or use a guide. One guy offered his services as a guide for $5. Shirts are only $3 (one Japanese lady thought that was too much and left in a huff saying that it should only be $1....this is not a place to bargain - the money goes to an excellent cause!). His handout also says that the people living in the fields where Aki is clearing are very poor and have nothing, so gifts of unwanted clothes, shoes or medicine (with instructions) can be donated to Aki and he will bring them to these people. He also has a Western Union account."

As the previous reviews have mentioned, it is out of the way, and is really only accessible by taxi or car. Going by tuk tuk is an option but only for the brave hearted as it is a 10 minute drive down a very bumpy unmade road full of potholes. Be patient as we had to ask about 8 people who worked in our hotel before anyone could tell us exactly where it was (nearest landmark is Le Meridien hotel).The museum is free entry although as most of the work of Aki Ra depends on donations, it is worth donating as much as you can to this worthwhile cause. There are posters around and if my memory serves me right they say that it costs $3 to safely disarm each landmine. Seeing as there are still hundreds of thousands of landmines in the more remote areas it puts it all into perspective.The museum is situated in the open and there are displays, films to watch and piles and piles of landmines. It really is a disturbing but very moving place to visit and highlights how bad the problem still is. Many of the children that Aki Ra & his wife have adopted who have lost limbs will act as your guides (posters say offer them $1 for their tour so they can make sure that each child gets the same).There is also a shop there that sells t shirts, linen and other souvenirs & this is one place where people tend to not start bargaining down the price. There are also small books & guides that you can take away with you. You are also free to take photos but it's probably best to do so in a tasteful way. Allow at least an hour for the visit. This was the last place we visited before we flew back to Bangkok and it left a very lasting impression."

The museum was an eye-opener and the scale of the landmine problem made patently clear by the simple information and personal accounts that were pinned around the walls. The summary of Aki's work in the villages was a sobering testimony of what one man can achieve. We met and talked to a number of the young people with missing limbs who had made the museum their home. They even helped us with a problem with our bike! Go see it. Well worth the visit. Unfortunately we don't seem to be able to access the museum's website.Maxwell MeyerLondon"
