We started off with a 25min cable car ride that showed fantastic views of the surrounding country side plus the airport. We arrived at the destination and met our guide Ross who took us to a tea making demonstration where they show you the correct was to make tea and especially bloom tea. We were able to sample these teas before going on a short bus ride to Tai O fishing village where our guide showed us through the market explaining about the different typed of dried fish they were selling. We then went on a boat ride where we saw how the locals lived in houses on stilts over the water, followed by a fun boat ride into the sea to see if we could spot the pink dolphins. We had no luck that day but the boat ride was fun and we did see a number of flying fish. After our boat trip we were free to wander around the village and I bought some almond biscuits from the bakery. Then back on the bus to go to see the big Buddha that is made out of bronze and it sits on a hill and if you have the energy you can climb to the top for a closer look. We then went to the Po Lin Monastery which is only a short walk from the Buddha. It is very beautiful and the atmosphere is very serene.They are noted for their vegetarian food but if that is not your thing there are other food outlets plus shops where you catch the cable cars. I thoroughly enjoyed our tour and the cable car ride."

Whether you are a solo traveler as I was or traveling with family, Lantau Island is something everyone should experience while visiting Hong Kong. Despite the numerous ads for tour operators, this was one of the easiest experiences I had in Hong Kong. From the Crystal Cabin (glass bottom cable car) to Tian Tan Buddha to Po Lin Monastery, it was completely accessible and easy to navigate on my own. Using the MTR app for iPhone, I navigated my way from Jordan MTR to Lantau Island in less than 40 minutes. My recommendation, take the cable car round trip but arrive early on a weekday. At 9am with Starbucks in hand (there's one less than 3 minute walk from Ngong Ping gates) I was first in line. Many places will say buy tickets in advance, I had no issue getting my tickets the day of. The Crystal Cabin has much shorter lines, and the views thru the glass bottom are spectacular. Separate review under Ngong Ping experience.You can make Lantau Island a three hour visit or full day depending on your objectives. Tian Tan Buddha, Po Lin Monastery and walking amongst the various storefronts was accomplished solo in 4 hours. When I left in early afternoon, the lines were similar to any major theme park to get tickets / cable cars. There is so much to see, from lush mountain tops, hidden trails and waterfalls to nearby HKG actively ushering people to and from Hong Kong. I have zero regrets spending part of my 72 hours here, and I would do it again."

As we did the reverse route we took first the bus (23) to Tai O Fishing Village and had a great lunch there. From Tai O we took a taxi ($ 52) to Bus to Ngong Ping Village with the Giant Buddha, Poh Lin Monastery. If you are at the Ngong Ping Village you may want to walk the Wisdom Path. 15 Mins and you have a great view of the reservoir and the mountains. Back to Tung Chung Station by Cable Car. Note: we took the cable car at 5.30pm and had to wait almost an hour before we could go. The waiting time is very long."

Tai O is a small fishing village where things could not be more different from Kowloon and central. So different from the busy City, with a lot of small villages you can discover. The small village Mui Wo is worth a visit, if you want to escape the rush. Surrounded by mountains, just the busride is beautiful. From MuiWo, you can also take the ferry to or from Discovery Bay and relax at the beach, have a dinner at the oceanfront restaurants or continue with the fast ferry directly to Central. From Tung Chung, you can take the cable car up the mountain and end up at the big Buddha. You can also walk up there, if you want a bit more exercise. There is a trail following the cable car, with a stunning view of the Airport. You will have to be in good shape, from Tung Chung it will take more than 2 hours uphill walking. All around Lantau, you will find really good walking trails. Fung Wong Shan, called Lantau Peak, is the highest point on Lantau, with 934 meters."

If not, you won't, because the line will get 2 hours long by 10am. Buy a one way trip and don't waste money on any packages. You can spend a few more dollars for the crystal cabin, but it's just a glass floor and not that exciting. At the top, walk through the village and don't overpay for stuff here. It is very commercialized and corporate so no haggling. Go to Buddha and don't buy meal plan. Get free bottle of water and ice cream at the top before you head back down. Walk through Po Lin and circle back to the bus depot. Take bus (15 minute air conditioned ride that is clean and comfortable) to Tai O fishing village. Jump on a junk boat and see the stilt houses at low tide hopefully and possibly see the white dolphins in the bay (we saw 2). Then after the 20 minute boat ride, walk the village streets and eat at one or more of the local street food vendors. The Giant Fish Ball place was my favorite. Grab a beer to walk with. then, head back to the bus terminal and go back to the Lantau terminal (25 minutes on bus) and head back to your hotel. Plan for 5 hours at least but no more than 6.5 including transit. Perfect day trip!"

We purchased the crystal cabin which means it has a see through floor which was great as you get to quite a height. Ngong Ping village was surprisingly enjoyable. Ensure you sign up for the 5D cinema as that was great fun. The Buddha film was worth a look as well. Some of the shops had items that we had not seen anywhere else in HK and some of the stores had some very good bargains. The Po Lin Temple had such intricate designs on the building and were beautiful inside. The Big Buddha was a decent climb up the stairs but the view was worth it. Just make sure you go to the back to see the views behind of the rest of the island and the surrounding bays and islands. "

There are a couple of nice beaches near the ferry terminal and it was very quiet on a Friday. I walked up the well marked path to the waterfall and the old silver mine. Very steep uphill climb and debatable as to whether it was worth it but certainly nice to get out of the city. I could have spent a few more hours walking the heritage trail but decided against. Couldn't find anywhere to eat that looked appetising. There are, I believe, some good hiking trails on the island and a bus trip might have been a good idea but walking distance from the fast ferry? I'd look at another option another time."

Arrived @cable car to see a seemingly endless queue ahead when I hit the jackpot! Tour guide offering package deal with cable car, guided bus tour, boat ride, fishing village visit and the bonus fast track lane both ways for only twice cost of just cable car. ($68 instead of $34) Saved myself total of 2 precious hours and of standing in humid unpleasant conditions) . Fantastic ride across the mountain and trip in island , seeing local culture and monastery, Buddha is a must see. From airport and back to airport you need at least 3-4 hours. Can stay longer if you have time to soak in the local atmosphere .You can shop also at outlets if you need that last minute brand piece! Thanks ngong ping360 and guides for a truly memorable day ! You can also buy the trip on tour from HK for about $180!! Just take the train yourself from HK ( or bus from airport) and save yourself a bundle and manage your own time."

We took the crystal cabin cable car ride (180 HKD one-way but frankly you don't lose out much if you decide on the cheaper standard cabin) from the Nong Ping 360 terminal next to Tung Chung MTR station. We bought our cable car tickets from a travel agent to avoid the queue as there is a separate line for that and went there early at 9am, time the rides open on weekends.  It was quite mystical as the cable car comes up to the Nong Ping village and the majestic Big Buddha loomed in the distance. We didn't care much for the shops in the village as it's all very commercial and headed straight for the Big Buddha and the Po Lin monastery. Worth the experience to climb the 200-odd steps up to the bronze statue. The temples in the monastery are quite impressive too.  From Nong Ping village we took Bus #21 to Tai O village. The fare is only 6.6 HKD and took only 20 mins but make sure to check the bus schedule by the bus shelter so you can be there early to ensure you get on as it is a one-hour interval between buses.  From Tai O we took Bus 1 to Mui Wo to catch the ferry to Central MTR station. The bus ride is about 50 mins and the ferry ride (choose the faster ferry) took only 30 mins. Make sure to check the ferry times before you sit down for lunch at the Mui Wo cooked food market."

However, it turned out to be one of our favourite activities of our trip.We booked our tickets in advance online and I am so pleased we did. When we arrived there was a HUGE queue for people buying tickets, it must have been at least an hour long. Because we had bought tickets in advance we strolled to a queue with about 6 people in it. Once you've bought your ticket you then need to join another queue to board the cable car.We opted for a standard cable car rather than the one with the glass bottom. Another winning decision as the queue for the glass bottom was huge and more expensive with less cable cars.The trip in the cable car is stunning with amazing views. When you get close to the top, the Big Buddha on top of the hill comes into view for the first time and it is really impressive. There is a really nice little village at the top although quite commercialised with Starbucks and Subway etc. We walked through the village towards the Buddha and climbed the steps up to the top. It was hard works and the heat didn't help but well worth it when we got to the top.I really loved this day trip out and was definitely a highlight for all of us."

I wanted to visit the \"Giant Buddha\" of Lantau Island for some time, finally had the chance. Usually a sky tram takes you to the Ngong Ping Pateau where the Buddha is located, BUT, it was down for service when I was there so a 45min hair raising bus ride was the order of the day. Hair raising ride because the Bus drivers know the route like the back of there hands, very narrow, windy road, forest on one side, beach front on the other with Water Buffalo walking around every where! Once at the Po Lin Monastery it is a very surreal and semi spiritual experience, at least for me. There is much to see besides the 85 foot Buddha. The monastery buildings are so ornate you can spend hours looking at all the intricate details inside & out (like at the \"Grand Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas\"). 260 or so steps up to see the Buddha, and it will most likely be hot & humid, drink lots of water before you start the climb, be careful of people stopping in front of you to take selfies, it happens a lot. The Buddha is stunning as is the view. This was one of the high lights of my trip. It can be touristy but with sereneness of the monastery, on going incense burning for the departed, Sculptures & art, it is an amazing place."

We took the standard cabin and the views are quite spectacular. The ride + big Buddha are the biggest attractions. The village is just an artificial construct and not that great. You can walk your way to the big Buddha from the station and it is a good 3-4 hour hop through the jungles but it is well paced and signposted."

Visit the big Buddha and take the Cable cars with a spectacular view over the airport... Something special and if you like take a cable car for a bit more money with a transparent glass bottom, enhances your views..... The story goes that since the Big Buddha was finished no major damage was done to the city by typhoons... Enjoy it and on your way back go to the Outlet center at Tung Chung, always a good bargain there and the real stuff, no fakes.."

Is where the Big Buddha and the cable car can be found, the easiest and quickest way to get there is take the metro to the last stop on the orange line, once outside a very short walk across the square is the entrance for the cable car ride.The crystal cable car is an upgrade to the normal cable car the crystal has a glass floor, the ride lasts approx, 30 mins and is absolutely breathtaking and well worth the extra and a much better way to get there than the bus.The queue was not long but well worth the wait. Even in the heat, take your camera you must take photo's.At the end of the cable car ride there are plenty of food and drink venues, and shops a short walk takes you to the Big Buddha and the temple. There are 282 steps approx to get to the top.Take water with you when going up the steps, it's on sale at the bottom and the top, we stopped twice for a wee rest going up the steps, once there it was a photo opportunity, and it was easier coming back down,At the temple it's also a photo opportunity with gift shops etc So this trip was one of the best we had on our stay and well worth the money, esp, the cable car."

There's an outlet mall just by the station, featuring some mid-priced brands and potentially good bargains.Upon exiting the station, we were quickly approached by people selling tickets to the cable car. It is not adviced to buy! We were attempted to be mislead by claiming that travel documentation is required for visiting Lantau, which is not true! In addition, tickets were more expensive there than in the actual cable car location. Cable cars are a short, well instructed walk away from the Tung Chung MTR station. Line was quite long, although progressed resonably quickly. Crystal cabin (glass floor) had a shorter waiting time than the standard one and we were glad to have chosen this one.Expect high price levels in the Ngong Ping village, which is a true tourist location. Tian Tan Buddha and Po Lin monastery are a short walk away from the village.Cable car ride is enjoyable, with beautiful scenery, so it's recommended for at least one direction. Bus was an excellent choice for returning. Bus 23 takes back from Ngong Ping to Tung Chung MTR station for only HKD 17 (Octopus card is accepted), and offers a different, yet interesting view of the beautiful scenery. The ride takes approximately 40 min."

From the metro station walk across the plaza in front of the outlet mall and follow the signs around to the cable car station . If you want to pay a bit extra there is a cable car with a glass bottom so you can view the trees and trails below. Even without the glass bottom, the views are stunning as you ascend to the top of Lantau Island. Once at the top there is the village of Ngong Ping with shops and restaurants. There is the huge statue of the Great Buddha with long steps up to the base of the stature which is immense. On one trip I was in charge of five youngsters between the ages of 12-14. I suggested they climb the steps to the top and get pictures taken from the top. They threw themselves into it as I sat like a slug and had an adult beverage and watched from below. Then they hiked back down and we went to lunch. On the way back they were all zonked out asleep from exhaustion. Great fun and great photos. If you don't want to wait for the next cable car there is the number 23 bus that will take you back to Tung Chung. The ride is very scenic and takes you through heavily wooded areas and past some pristine beaches and small villages. At Tung Chung you can pick up the subway MTR and get back to Kowloon. Your Octopus card will get you on the Metro, the cable car and the number 23 bus. Enjoy!"

Go across the bridge amongst the stilt houses along the creek and winds along to the sea. There is a beautiful coastal walk that is best taken from Tung Chung Town all the way to Tai O and takes about 4.5 hrs including a stop for lunch at a local shop with seating outside by the coast. All of these places are reached by a ferry ride from Central to Mui Wo, Lantau and then a bus.

Pick up at hotel around 8:00 and returned about 4:00 pm. Take the tour bus up to the Ngong Ping 360 skytram to get to the island. This is near the Hong Kong airport. We toured the grounds around the Buddha, visited the monastery, and had the vegetarian lunch at the monastery. After lunch, a few minutes to take some photos and then a bus ride up to the Big Buddha. It is an awesome sight. Once the Big Buddha tour is over, we headed down to Tai O. It is a village on the coast with many of houses on stilts over the water. We had a boat ride out about 1 mile into the South China Sea to see the white dolphins (only location in the world). The dolphins move pretty quick and it may be difficult to get a picture of them. After a small walking tour of Tai O it was back to Hong Kong. If the weather is nice, there are great views from the Buddha and the Skytram. There is plenty of walking and photo ops. There are places to eat other than the monastery. This was a great day away from the crowds of Hong Kong. Would definitely recommend this tour to everyone. Very family friendly.

I was staying on Hong Kong Island.It is well worth a visit.You can get there via ferry or the MTR (underground train line) and then the cable car.I chose the MTR and cable car route. This is quite easy. From Central (MTR station red line) you take the train to Tung Chung (MTR orange line), it takes approx half an hour. You exit the MTR and walk across to the 360 Ping cable car ( 2nins walk signposted). The cable car takes approx half an hour to Lantau - it's approx 5.7km over the South China Sea and is very scenic or you could be in the clouds !Lantau is lovely. There are some shops for souvenirs or just browsing and places to eat. That is just the start and certainly not the reason you should go. Walk through the shopping area takes you to the monastery, which is worth a visit and of course to view the Buddah given to Hong Kong from China. You can also get bus's from Lantau to the other parts of the island that are worth visiting - seaside towns, fishing villages etc.There are tour agents that can organise these for you or you can do this independently.Lantau has a lot of history and is very interesting. A good day out for everyone including children."

I'd suggest going on a week day in the morning, as weekends can be a bit crowded, especially if you want to take the cable car. I went Sunday morning around 11am and the line for the cable car took me about 1 hr 45 mins in total :( Overall, I'd say the cable car was nothing special, but fairly cheap so still a worthwhile experience if you have extra HK dollars to spare.The island itself is very cute - the Big Buddha is definitely worth seeing, if not just to catch a nice cool breeze and admire the view. The thousand buddhas in the back temple also really breathtaking. The Wisdom Trail is nice, as is the Lantau Peak trail (though quite the hike - bring 2-3 bottles of water for the 2.5 hour endeavor).I went on a cloudy day, which was great, because it wasn't too hot or humid. Left with no sunburns, and only was able to apply sunscreen once!But DON'T fall asleep on the bus back from Tai O village! I made the mistake of doing so, and woke up back on the main island :( Totally missed the Ngong Ping village stop, and wasn't able to take the cable car on the way back after buying a round trip ticket!"

The beach was sandy but there was a fair amount of litter. Tai O fishing village was excellent. We wandered through its market place before taking a short boat ride which provided good views of the houses, complete with sewage pipes which empty straight into the creek. Don't even think of trailing your hand in the water. At Po Lin we climbed up steep steps onto the huge Tian Tan Buddah before enjoying a yummy vegetarian lunch at the nearby monastery. A short walk through the shops of Ngon Ping village took us to a cable car terminal which gave us the most exhilarating 25 minute ride back to ground level. The views from here of the new airport are stupendous. This is a great way to spend a day in Hong Kong."

The moment you see the Giant Buddha is a real wow moment and you can't wait to get there. Once you arrive you can wander through all of the shops and food outlets, but you're best to wait until you're leaving to get souvenirs rather than carry them around with you.This is also the meeting point for an additional tour that you can go on, you have to buy your tickets at the same time as buying the cable car tickets. I highly recommend going on this tour, it takes you by air conditioned bus with guide to a fishing village where you then go out onto the water on a tourist water taxi. You can have a wander around the fishing village after the boat ride and buy some local items.Once you get back, the guide takes you through a temple and it's there that he leaves you.The stairs up to the Buddha are a killer if you're not very fit, but well worth the climb and it's a lot easier going down. You can wander around the base of the Buddha to get 360 degree views.Going on the tour also gives you a fast pass for the cable car on the way home, so you can skip the queues which can be worth it. Lantau Island is a very popular tourist destination so it can get quite busy late morning and afternoon.The souvenir shops have all kinds of gifts for people of all ages, so bring lots of money."

You can, with the bus, see the other isles and that's really cool to see local people how they cook, work, etc. It's largely different from Central or Kowloon lol.\nMust have !"

The large outdoor Buddha at Lantau was completed around 1995 and so is nowhere in the league of the other shrines and monasteries in south east Asia. That being said it is fun to walk around and admire the effort it took to erect a structure of such height. The area around this site is filled with tourist shops at exorbitant prices. The Po-Lin monastery is worth taking a quick look particularly the room with the gold Buddhas.When we last visited the island 15 or so years ago the lunch at the monastery was prepared and served by monks and was free. This is no longer the case, one is forced to choose a fixed menu at an exorbitant price and the quality and taste of the food disappointing. We would suggest avoiding eating at the monastery altogether. For us the main highlight of the trip was the cable car to and from the island as the views were great. "

The cable car ride was beautiful with a breathtaking view of HK. Walking up the steps to the Big Buddha was awesome and the hard work is rewarded with a spectacular panoramic view. I would have loved to go for a hike along one the many trails here, but due to heat and humidity, this just wasn't doable. Also, they have some other excursion options on the sea shore, but didn't try this out either. Good way to spend part of the day. It is crowded here, but there is enough open space to feel like you're on your own."

            "review": "Highlight of our trip. We travelled from Tshim Sha Tsui by the MTR on the red line, changed onto the orange line at Central and onto Lantau Island where you walk easily out to the clearly marked cable car stop. We arrived about 10:30-11am, and the line-up for the cable car was already very, very long. However it does move very quickly because there are about 10 counters selling tickets. We waited in queue for only 5 minutes before reaching the counter and buying our tickets.TIP: Spend the extra $8AUD pp and get seats on the glass-bottom car (\"crystal cabin\") - the wait for these cars is MUCH shorter because they're slightly more expensive!! It is worth the extra money just to skip the queue to board!! Plus the glass bottom is generally a cool experience.We paid for a one-way cable car ticket and got off at the top in Nong Ping Village. This is a FAKE village, built specifically for tourists. It is very pretty, but don't spend all your money in the expensive government-owned shops. Some of the shops on the right seem to be owned by locals and have better prices if you see something you fancy. (For example, I bought a little hand-made bowl very cheap and there were also other bits and pieces like nice bracelets for only $20HKD (like $2.5AUD).)From Nong Ping Village you follow the tourists to the Giant Buddha and also the Buddhist Monastery. Don't pay for a silly tour! You can do this all yourself by following the other tourists and its all free! After the Giant Buddha and Monastery we returned to Nong Ping Village to catch the bus to the Tai O fishing village on the other side of Lantau Island. If you don't know which bus, etc, ask a few people, you will usually find a young person who speaks English. The locals are VERY helpful if they can be! The bus is about $17HKD pp.Tai O Village is fantastic. Again, follow the flow of tourists around the village to look at the shops and wander around. You will soon find the stilt houses and other sights mentioned in various tours. It is all free! The locals allow tourists to walk freely around their homes and streets because tourists help to support this fairly poor society. But try to be respectful! Say hello to the locals as you walk past. Be polite. Don't forget you are walking around their homes. Don't be rude tourists! In the heart of the stilt houses in Tai O is a recently opened cafe where you can sit outside on the river and look out over the boats and lovely view while taking a coffee/beer/tea, etc. There is also food available. The people who run the cafe do so out of their home and they are SO nice, friendly and lovely. Even in the most opressively humid weather, sitting on the river provides a lovely cooling breeze. This cafe is truely a gem! I think if I lived in Hong Kong I would travel to Lantau Island JUST to sit here and have a coffee. Don't miss it if you visit Tai O Village. From Tai O, we walked back to the bus stop and caught a 40 min bus to another village where the ferry back to Hong Kong (Kawloon side) is located. It is easy to locate and pretty clearly marked. Just check out some tourist maps and it will all make sense! The bus ride is really cool. It runs through thick \"jungle\" where you expect monkeys and lions to pop out at every turn. It is very pretty.The ferry, again, is easy to traverse and very cheap. It takes you back to the harbour where you can then find the MTR to wherever you need. Lantau Island was the best day we spent in Hong Kong. It was scenic and interesting. However, not for the faint hearted when it is very hot! The hike up to see the Giant Buddha is challenging and there is quite a bit of walking between the Monastery and Nong Ping and around Tai O. However, it was such a great adventure and the cable car is not to be missed!"

I have to say, those houses are impressive, many of them even have balconies hahahahahahahaha. We then had a boat trip out into the bay, where there was a slim chance of seeing the rare Chinese White Dolphins,which we did not manage to see but we did get a better view of the scale of the new bridge they are building, with the mainland for the new rapid train rail-line and motorway to Beijing,which will be the biggest suspension bridge in the world at over 50km long.

There was no queue for the tickets at 9.30 am on a Saturday morning and only a short queue moving at the pace of the cable cars arriving. The pre booked tickets and crystal cabins both had much longer lines and waiting times. We enjoy the climb to the Budda, visit to monastery and wisdom path walk. Instead of returning the same way we planned to use the bus 21 to Tai O fishing village (leave 20 mins past each hour officially but when a crowd of people were there they just put on an extra bus. Boat trip out was a bit and village was a bit disappointing fof us who have seen better stilt villages elsewhere. The Bus 1 goes about every 30 mins - about 50 minute tour across the island ( there are a number of beaches you could stop at on the way or spend some time in to Mui Wo where you can catch the ferry back to Central, HongKong island ( about an hour) with interesting views of many of the other outlying islands."

We took the mtr from tsim sha tsui (red line) to central station, walked over to the Hong Kong line (orange line) and took the train directly to Tung Chung. From there it's a 5min walk to the cable car rides. The last cable car leaves Lantau Island at 18:00. I suggest heading to the exit by 17:00 as the queues do get very long. There are many restaurants you can eat from and there is a temple you can get cheap vegetarian food at. I will however recommend Ebenezer restaurant. It is value for money and the best Turkish food in HK. MRound trip: HK$ 187Duration: 25mins each way. Maximum of 8 people per carAttractions: Giant Budha, temple, spectacular views, and great atmosphere. Tip: be prepared for very long queues min of 50mins wait. Also if you are afraid of heights, it might not be the best mode of transport. There are buses that drive that route. Edk"

Beautiful place! Scenic. The giant Buddha slowly comes into view as you journey over Lantau inside the Ngong Ping 360 cable car offering spectacular 360-degree views. This tour combines all of Lantau's beloved sites into around four hours of non-stop exploring. Stroll through the Ngong Ping Village and then trek up to 268 steps the peaceful giant Buddha, a Hong Kong icon. From sky to water, this tour will satisfied our cravings to see all of this beautiful isle. There are two types of tickets available for the Tram Cabins. Round trip standard or crystal cabin cable car tickets o. We used the standard one since the crystal one was overbooked. in the crustal cabin the only difference is that the floor of the cabin is of thick glass and you could see the scenes beneth you. Anyway you can see the same in the Standard class. You can find a good deal at klook.com for these trams. We had to wait in the line for about 60 huge minutes to board the trams. But it was all worth it once we are on the peak. Lovely lovely view. The Buddha statue is mesmerising and you could stare it forever. You must be reach the Ngong Ping village at one of the following times. The bracketed time is the latest you should be retrieving your tickets from Tung Chung Cable Car Terminal for best experience. 11:30 (10:35 ticketing)12:30 (11:35 ticketing)13:30 (12:35 ticketing)15:00 only during weekend & public holiday (14:05 ticketing)There is one interesting thing , is when you go down the 268 steps, there is a circle just exactly in the same line of buddha's statue. If you stand on that circle and speak something you could hear your own echo. Not many knew this and when we tried this (as one of the locals informed us) it was mind blowing. Once must try it."

The view what you can experience through crystal cable that you can never experience through the normal cable car. During the trip it takes you above the sea, forest and the view you can see from your cable downwards. The crystal cable is totally transparent and the line of this cable is small as well as it is a bit costly than normal cable car so few people take this one. We reached over here early in the morning so that we can avoid bigger lines to buy the tickets. And by the time we reached back it was to crowed OMG. But the overall experience for us it was fantastic of our travel. We went through the clouds, above the sea, forest which we could see through and fell. Specially when we went through clouds it was all around and we could see anything. But the experience was amazing the clouds came inside as well through the little partition. Uhhh it was amazing."

Take the Mui Wo ferry from Pier 6 in Central and once you get to Mui Wo the 3M bus and get off at Pak Au. The stop is announced it is at the top of a steep hill. Quite a few hikers will get off your bus as quite a few of Lantau hikes start or finish here. Cross the road and climb the few steps to the pavilion. There are two hikes that begin here, the Sunset Peak hike which is a rigorous hike in the heat of summer but very beautiful and the Lantau Country Trail which is a beautiful easy walk perfect for a summers day. The views from this hike are amazing. It crosses many streams and waterfalls so don't forget to bring some snacks as well as water. The hike is about 6 KM and takes me a leisurely 90 minutes and longer if I sit and enjoy the views. The hike ends at Nam Shan so take the signs to the South Lantau Road where you can pick up a bus back to Mui Wo and lunch and a swim or cross the South Lantau Road where you can get the 2 bus to Ngong Ping and Big Budha, 1 bus to Tai O and the Doplphins or 3M to Tung Chung.There is so much to see and do on Lantau that you easily spend a day (or more) here."

Nice to see the countryside and included a stop at a fishing village, visit to the very large seated Buddha, and good local lunch at the neighboring monastery. The monastery buildings and grounds were exquisite. Also, we took the tram over the hill back toward the airport which had very nice views. Well worth getting out of the city for."

Lots of it are quiet countryside where you can visit beautiful hills and beaches and you will be amazed at the sight of buffalos walking sedately along the roads. Outside of Tung Chung the road becomes restricted to buses, taxi ( blue ones) and local traffic. Expect huge delays at the Tung Chung bus depot on public holidays, and massive queues at Nong Ping 360 start point too. If you want to visit the citygate outlet stores, take shin guards and a big bag of patience. That spot is crammed packed with tourists all the time, but impossible to walk around on holidays. Please if you visit do not walk aimlessly around the Taste supermarket, we local folk shop there for food, and waiting 40 minutes at a check out does not help us appreciate visitors.One last little thing, the buffalo on Lantau are not paid actors, like Mickey and Minnie at disneyland. They live there and just want to have a peaceful life, so please do not let your hyper children loose on them. Take responsibility for your offspring, you made them so you should train them.Enjoy the biggest island in Hong Kong but respect those who live there all the time, human and wildlife."

The queue to get the cable car ticket is horribly long on weekends. Otherwise, go early about 9am to get shorter queue. If your budget allows, get the crystal cable car, it has a glass floor to view below. The ride is about 40 mins, you get to see planes landing and taking off from the cable car, nice greenery. Once you get to Lantau island, you can opt to go sight seeing at the various attraction or just relax at the various shops, get some food and drink, enjoy basking and people watching.

The Po Lin Monastery's architecture was inspiring and it was very quiet and peaceful, really good for meditating (with lots of flowers and plants everywhere). The view from the top was really my favorite, the looming mountains shrouded in mist was magical. You need to be a bit fit to climb the steps though but worth it!

Though we've been in HK about 8 times, this was our first time ever out to Lantau Island - primarily because it would take up the whole day. or most of it. We were happy that we did. Lots of great sights, one of the few fishing villages left, and of course, the Big Buddha and the monastery!Lantau means \u2018Rotten head\u2019, which refers to the way the hills looked like, after the \u201cGreat Clearance\u201d and people eventually returned in 1669. Five villages were subsequently resettled: Tai O, Tung Sai Chung, Lo Pui O, Shek Pik and Mui Wo. There are Chinese white dolphins, sometimes called pink dolphins, water buffaloes, and a \u201c5-star\u201d prison, where prisoners have tennis courts, etc. Sounds like our Gitmo prison! You know how we have our \u201cDeer Crossing\u201d or \u201cWatch out for Deer\u201d signs? They\u2019ve got similar ones, only \u201cWatch out for Cattle\u201d. These were cows that escaped when the land was being developed and have multiplied. We saw at least 5 of them, and they could be in the middle of the road!First stop was at Cheng Sai (\u201cLong Sand\u201d) Beach. Beautiful area, nice sandy beach, relatively unknown, and we even saw some crabs scurrying around in the sand after the tide went out. Water was relatively warm, and because it was a Friday, it was not crowded at all - and not that well known, even among HK residents.. Some residents use this as a \u2018Staycation\u2019. Next was Tai O, a fishing village with traditional houses on stilts. You can see the businesses, selling all sorts of interesting food stuff (mostly sea), and in the back or upstairs is the residence, storage area, etc. Some of the interesting food items, mostly dried were: Fish gills, cuttlefish, various shrimps and scallops, starfish, and fish. From our local tour guide, if residents were anywhere close to the island, they bought their seafood here!We also entered a monastery and took a look around. NOTE: I am skipping photos of the Tai O fishing village, as I noticed that it is separately reviewed by TripAdvisor. <=====Then it was onto the Giant Buddha, 85-foot (26 m)-high bronze Tian Tan Buddha statue, once the world's largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha statue, and is only part of the Po Lin Monastery. We did not walk up the 268 steps to the top of the Giant Buddha. We then came down, crossed the Mall of Heroes, which consisted of 12 Divine Generals in China history, each one having a birthday in one of the Chinese astrological symbols.We then went to the Po Lin Monastery restaurant for a vegetarian lunch \u2013 all the dishes were tasty! And quite a bit of difference from the Shanghai and Beijing food we\u2019ve been having! We then went into the Po Lin Monastery and in the back of that building was the Grand Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas. I will have to take their word for it, since I didn\u2019t count them all.Then it was finally time to go back to Kowloon and our hotel. We took the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car, but it was the Standard cable car, not the Crystal (glass bottom) cable car. It travelled about 7 kilometers, which took 20-25 minutes or so, and we could see quite a bit of the areas all around us, as well as below.All in all, it was a very good and worth-while trip and if you've got the day, this is a great place to spend it!"

This is almost 20 mnts ride over sea, hills and a vally side. The best part is the crystal cabins which will have a see through base and the experience to watch the valley and the sea deep is just amazing. It is recommended to opt for crystal cabin though it would cost bit more than the normal cabin. If possible, book it though in advance through your travel agent so as you don't have to waste time by standing in long queue for tickets as the agents ticket entry has pass through.."

Plan on 5-6 hours roundtrip and an additional 2-3 hours if you also go to Tai O fishing village or do some hiking in the area. From Kowloon take the MTR (orange line) to Tung Chung station and follow the crowd. The cable car terminal is just as you exit the MTR station. I would suggest pre-purchasing tickets on line to avoid the ticket line and they were cheaper. You will still have to stand in line for the cable car. You may want to check the website the night before, we discovered that the cable car would be closed for maintenance and then researched which bus to take instead. The bus terminal is a 5 minute walk past the cable car terminal, take bus 23. We went early, beat the crowds and the heat. Be aware that the cable car opens earlier than Big Buddha (which opens at 10). There is supposed to be some great hiking in the area, which we did not do. Instead, we took the 21 bus from the Big Buddha to Tai O fishing village and spent a few hours in the fishing village walking the streets and took a boat cruise to see the stick houses and also saw some pink dolphins. From Tai O you can take a bus all the way back to the MTR station. All in all a busy but lovely day trip!"

Bus leaves from the same area at Tung Chung train station..... just walk towards the cable car area.One hour trip on the bus to a lovely fishing village.

Although certain parts of the island have been developed (mainly the airport) this site has not. My husband was quick to kick off his shoes and get his feet into the South China sea (I was in the meantime rescuing a stick insect that I found in the toilets, ha ha). We also visited the Tai O fishing village - wow, this was pretty interesting. The guide said it was not touristy and smelt of fish and he was right. All sorts of things for sale there and very atmospheric. Well worth the visit.The best thing of all though was the sky rail Cable Car. We caught it back at the end of the tour. It was a 25 minute 5.7km trip of panoramic awesomeness. You must do this. You can either go in a glass car or a regular one. We went in a regular one but on hindsight a glass one would've added an extra level of....what, perhaps fear? Lots of photo opportunities here, it was truly wonderful.

There are lots of fast food options too including Subway and Starbucks so it doesn't feel particularly special when you arrive, but when you get past all that and climb the steps to Big Buddah it really hits you how special this area is. Po Lin Monastery is absolutely beautiful too.From Ngong Ping Village you can get the 21 bus to Tai O fishing village. Here you can get a boat ride around all the stilt houses and around the coast in search for dolphins. A 20 minute boat ride only cost HK$25 (about \u00a32.20). You can walk through the village with all the tiny local shops and out onto the stilt houses where some of the locals have set up small restaurants and bars. Visit Julia in Triple Lanterns Cafe in the middle of the stilt houses for a very warm welcome and truly incredible views.You can get another bus to Mui Wo to catch a ferry back to Central."

The cable cars journey is long and pretty high up. you have a choice of a normal cabin or a crystal glass cabin, which is not recommended if you are not comfortable with heights. the journey takes at least 15-20 mins to get to the top of the mountain and it is a pleasant ride with a lot of photo opportunities. When you get to the top you land in the village from which the buddha and the monastery are a short walk away. there are a few restaurants and cafes open but they close as soon as the cable cars close for the day which is around 6:00pm. i would suggest getting there early as the queue to get off the mountain is a long one. it was certainly my best experience of Hong Kong and a great day out."

Tung Chung Station - which takes you to the Ngong Ping 360 cable carFerry - Central Pier to Mui Wo Pier. From Mui Wo there are buses that takes you to different parts of the island (such as Tai O, Shek bi reservoir), good way to reach different sections of the Lantau hiking trail. Taking the ferry and bus is definitely way cheaper than the cable car but you need to know which stops to get off and you miss the aerial view of Hong Kong from the cable car.Definitely worth half-day to a whole day's visit"

The view of the airport island is also very good - the areal view of the airport and the flights taking off, landing is amazing. Finally the Big Buddha and the weather at the top is amazing...

Once up in the hill, the village was not much of an attraction, mainly commercialized cafes and souvenir shop. The walk around was ok but not outstanding. The claim up to the buddha was ok. The whole experience was the cable car but on a stormy windy day, it was a very frightening experience. The car stopped halfway due to high way and the car swayed quite a bit. Some people got a bit nausea. There isnt much to do that would take up a few hours. Only the Monastry and the Buddha worth seeing and between them 1hr tops.

Have a Plan B - not for the island visit - which is excellent - but for your travel plans.We arrived at the Cable Car at about 11.45am and after an hour's wait finally reached the kiosk. We took the option of the Cable Car / Bus / Boat roll-up option, but only after I purchased the tickets did the ticket seller tell us that we needed 4-5 hours and the last cable car back was at 4.45pm. Moreover, if you think that you're nearing the cable car when you bought your ticket think again. Concealed from view, behind the ticket office is the next queue for the cable car. Longer even than the one that we had stood for over an hour in already. So, tip number 1 is, unlike us, to arrive early !The lack of information in the lead up to purchasing the ticket troubled me. For example during the entire length of the queue to the kiosk posters promoted the cable car / bus/ boat trip combo but failed to give any info on the times or routes of the buses, the time of the last cable car down, the last time for the boat trip etc leaving you with the impression that you were probably getting value for money by purchasing the combo ticket, but not giving you the opportunity of planning how to use it, especially at times of heavy queues. So, if the queue is snaking up towards the kiosk when you arrive, have a Plan B, and take account of the following:1. The free buses that are part of the combo ticket run long after the last cable car down the hill from the Buddha.2. If, therefore, you are cutting it fine to visit Tai-O and get back for the return of the last cable car forget the cable car. You can get a bus back either to the MTR station or alternatively a different bus to the Ferry Terminal which for a small extra fee takes you back to Hong Kong Island. As for the island itself, it is a must for any visit to HK. The Buddha is impressive and Tai-O is fascinating."

Restaurants in Discovery Bay is mid market and touristy, but as Discovery Bay is more spacious, outdoor sitting is better served.

The main attractions on lantau island are \"Big Buddha\", \"Po Lin Monastery\", \"Tai O\" and \"Pui O\" and \"Disneyland\". The best way to get to Lantau island and explore is:1. Take the MTR Tung Shun Line all the way to Tung Shun.2. Take the cable car to Ngong Ping for the Po Ling Monastary and Big Buddha 3. Take the Bus (hourly) to Tai O village. Bus #21 from the Big Buddha (~15 minutes).4. Take an inexpensive boat trip to see the wooden-stilt houses along the waterfront and, on a good day, the pink dolphins out in the bay.5. Wander through the village with its market and tiny shops and along the shore line to the Old Police Station perched on the cliff-side.6. Tea and cheesecake would be my recommendation at the Old Police Station, but a wide range of refreshments are available.7. Walk back to the village and take the bus back to Tung Shun and the MTR back to Hong Kong City for a bit of night life."

We booked this trip with Viator and so glad we did as we could not believe the length of the queue of people buying tickets to the cable car on the day. We zoomed up the outside of these long lines of people and figure we would have saved up to a couple of hours in time. The cable ride was terrific even though the day was quite smoggy and it afforded great views of the airport and the mountains. Once there we enjoyed visiting the Big Buddha, the monastery and a tasty vegetarian lunch (no meat allowed on this site) before taking the cable car back down the mountain to be astounded by even longer queues at around 3pm."

You can either sign up for a tour of the island with a company, or make your own way over and see what you wish and spend time how you like, although the convenience of being on a tour and them knowing the roads is hard to pass up. Some of the must see attractions are the small fishing village known as Tai O where you can have a quick lunch and go out on a boat ride to see the pink dolphins, the big Buddha statue with it's accompanying monastery, and of course the cable car ride to or from the train station up to the Buddha, with it's amazing views. If not going with a tour, be sure to plan your day and transportation ahead of time to make sure no time is wasted trying to figure out how to get where you are going."

It was about a 30 minute MTR ride followed by a 50 minute bus ride and is one of the more remote locations in Hong Kong. We got there early to avoid the crowds and pottered around the lovely little market, explored the temple and then walked up to the top of the ridge and along the pathway that goes above the village. A great escape from the crowds of Hong Kong though there were many Chinese tourists when we went. The village is set to change rapidly if plans go ahead to link it to the mainland by a massive highway. See Tai O now before it's too late."

Include the Tai O fishing village tour because it will be worth it. Especially the boat ride around the fishing village because, if you're lucky you can see dolphins or a school of flying fishes jumping out of the water. It is also near a big shopping outlet.

There are the usual fast food outlets at the end of the cable car ride, before you get to the big Buddha. Coming back at the end of the day either leave a little before the place closes or be prepared for a 70 minute wait to return on the cable cars. The buses to Tung Chung MTR were also subject to long queues. Less people seem to opt for the return journey by ferry so we found we were able to get on a bus to the ferry relatively easily and then hop straight onto the ferry back to Hong Kong, using our Octopus cards.

But it is a wonderful ride with amazing views of the airport on it's manmade island and the $14b bridge to Macau which is under construction.We visited the village, which has a number of shops selling nice souvenirs of Hong Kong, not the usual cheap stuff that you see everywhere, there's even a shop selling nothing but chopsticks.The walk up the steps to the Buddha will take your breath away, as will the view from the top.The Po Ling Monastery is beautifully decorated, and well worth a few photos.

You can combine some of them (say, the outlet mall, cable car, the Buddha and monastery village) in a day, but if you'd rather take it easy and the weather is good, just take the ferry from Central to Mui Wo for a day on the beach. There are lots of places to eat, from perfectly safe 'dai pai dongs' selling fresh local food, to bars and local restaurants. For a glimpse of more of the island, take a bus from the ferry either to the Big Buddha or to Tung Chung. Hikers can enjoy Lantau's walking trails, many of which are not too demanding.

It was a breathtaking experience and I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends who have chosen Hong Kong as a travel destination.I would also like to recommend the Wisdom Path for people who are interested in Buddhism. You'll need to walk about 10 minutes to the reach the 38 wooden steles, and on each wooden stele is a line from the Heart Sutra, a Buddhist classic."

I believe there are other ways, but we felt that the metro was the easiest. From there, we jumped on the cable car (purchase the tickets online to avoid the lines as much as possible!!!!). I initially tried to avoid the cable car, since I have a fear of heights and also have motion sickness at times, but I bit the bullet and just decided to ride the cars. The cable car was not that bad and only started to slightly sway towards the end...I believe this is because it was a windy day. However should you not want to get to the big Buddha by cable car, you can take a bus (which I heard you can still get motion sickness from the winding roads) or taxi.Once you get to the Buddha (after 20 min by cable car), you will first enter a village which is somewhat touristy. Walk through the village and you will get to the base of the Buddha and the templeThe sight is something truly unbelievable. It is recommended for individuals of all ages. Fyi- dress warm if a cold day as the cable car has little open air slits so it can get a little breezy. "

We spent a fascinating day at Lantau Island by visiting Ngong Ping Village, Lo Pin Monastery, Big Buddha, and Tai O.We took the MTR from our hotel in Kowloon to Tung Chung on Lantau Island. From the Tung Chung MTR station, we walked to the cable car station. It was a Saturday and we had to wait about 40 minutes to get on the cable car. It was about a 25-minute ride on the cable car to Ngong Ping Village. You do get a nice view during the cable car ride.Ngong Ping Village is quite touristy but worth exploring. Cattle do roam freely in the village. There were many shops and eateries catering to tourists lining the main street of the village.The Lo Pin Monastery is a short walk from the village centre. It\u2019s worth exploring also. The Monastery Restaurant serves a vegetarian meal. We walked the Wisdom Path next to the monastery that led to the 38 wooden columns with inscriptions from the Heart Sutra.The Big Buddha is just next to the monastery. It\u2019s a 268-step climb to the top. It\u2019s definitely worth the climb for a good view of the surrounding countryside.Afterwards, we took the bus to the fishing village of Tai O. Tai O is definitely worth a visit for something that is completely different from that of Kowloon. At the end of our visit, we took the bus back to Tung Chung to catch the MTR back to our hotel in Kowloon. There was an unusually long wait of about an hour to catch the bus."

As I understand it, there are 3 main things to do on Lantau Island: Tai-O (the fishing village), the Big Buddah / Po Lin Monastery and that Sky-Ride thing at Ngong Ping 360.The Good: I took the ferry from Hong Kong to Lamma. It's about 50 minutes. Beautiful scenery along the way, fun ride! Then, I took a bus to Tai-O. The bus ride is great - lots to see, lots of twisty roads. Tai-O was my favorite part of going to Hong Kong. It's like going back in time with houses built on stilts over the water. For 3 dollars they'll take you on a boat tour of the area.From Tai-O you can catch a bus to the Big Buddah. It's awesome! A must see. The Po-Lin Monastery is amazing also. The bus signs are clear and easy to read. It's nearly impossible to get lost.The Bad: The line at Ngong Ping to catch the SkyRide was ridiculously long. About an hour wait. I skipped it.The Ugly: My guidebook listed having the vegetarian lunch at the Po Lin Monastery as a \"must-do.\" Don't do it! The food is terrible. Tasteless, bland, ugly dining room, and way to expensive. When the est part of your Chinese meal is the rice, you know the food sucks!"

As a non Buddhist, it was a peaceful exploration surrounded by true buddhists worshipping. It was wonderful watching them in practice of tradition. As if the modes of transportation so far wasn\u2019t enough, we came down the mountain using the Ngong Ping 360 Skyrail. The Skyrail cable car was a joy to ride down the mountain.

We then caught a bus from outside the ferry dock which terminated at the Po Lin Monastery which has the Giant (Big) Buddha and the Hall of Ten Thousand Buddha's. The Giant Buddha is at the top of a 1000step stairclimb so I wouldn't recommend it for the unfit or those in a rush, but it was quite spectacular and there's a museum inside as well. We also had lunch at the monastery which was quite tasty and then made our way down through the village to the cable car which is an amazing ride across the island and the channel back to Hong Kong Island! This terminated opposite a MRT station which then took us back into HK. I would recommend this as a FULL day ou as we did it but if you're pushed for time , I'd probably take the MRT to the HK cable car station and do it to and from Launtau Island. The journey is 50 min return that way."

The winds were quite strong when we did the ride, and that felt very intense. Especially near tower T7. The car swung sideways a lot. We also opted for the glass bottom car, which meant great views and more a sense of hanging by a cable, and nothing else. Spectacular views and an impressive ride. Highly recommended."

I kept telling myself that I want to go to this place if I had a chance to go to Hk.I only have one day in Hk, and I already spent half a day getting lost in Nathan road searching for my hostel. However, I'm glad making the right choices by bought the ticket to Lantau Island from my guesthouse and I choosed the Crystal Cabin for round trip. It's around 100hkd cheaper rhan the original price in the lantau island web.When I arrived in the ticket gate, the queing was really long (altough its Tuesday), they split the line into two, the left line was really long, almost 500m until the ticket counter. I asked the people there and show me my \"ticket\" that I bought from the hostel, she told me to go to the right line and straight to the ticket counter for exchanging my \"ticket\" (happened to be a voucher) with the real ticket.And I felt so pitty with people that quieing to buy the ticket there. It its the best to buy the ticket upfront from the web/ from your hostel/ hotel. After I got my real ticket (kind of sticker bracelet), I thank God that I choosed the crystal cabin, its a bit more expensive than the usual cabin, but again, I saved my time since because the quieing for the crystal cabin much shorter than the common cabin.Before hop on into my cabin, I downloaded their apps so I could listen the e-guide along the journey from Hk to Lantau Island (It's avalaibke in some language including english - of course). Once you arrived in Lantau Island, it's best to skip the \"village area\" it's more like an artificial street that full with souvenir shops.Just go straight to the Big Budha statue, climbing some steps and enjoying the view, but don't spent too much time there. Going down and took the narrow street to \"wisdom path\" (just follow the street board), not many people walk to that way, but its the right way, just walk, you will go inside a small forest.The forest so quite and relaxing, you will only meet some people along the way... just keep walking, followed the small road, its about 15 - 30 minutes walk (depend on your speed), until you find the wisdom path on the right and lantau peak if you go straight. I didnt have a chance to go to Lantau Peak because its almost dark and still have to walk down, but I enjoyed the Wisdom Path a lot, the hike and the fresh air.After going down, I made a stop at the vegetarian cafe and had some dessert, the price is really cheap and the food so tasty. I also buy some souvenirs from the store in the villae before ride my crystal cabin. And again, so grateful that I bought the crystal cabin, I boarding at my crystal cabin in 10 min. While the others that took the common cabin still standing in \"never ending queing\"The next time I go to Hk, I want to come here again but through walking path instead took the crystal cabin. It will take some hours, but anyway, I love hiking, so I dont mind. :)"

The ride was interesting because of the glass bottom and the beautiful 360 views of the mountains. Unfortunately it was a very foggy day and we could not see the Big Buddha. However on the positive side, the fog added a different ambiance to our visit, which we also enjoyed. Ngong Ping village has a selection of food and souvenir shops including Starbucks and Subway. Po Lin Monastery has an impressive Ten thousand Buddha Hall which is a must-see. We ate the best tasting Tofu-fa (bean curd dessert) at the Po Lin monastery food area but did not have the vegetarian meal there.We did not get to visit Tai O Fishing Village but did some bargain hunting at the Citygate outlet shopping mall just beside the cable car station.One tip: Do book your cable car tickets online and do arrive early in the day to start your cable car journey, specially on a weekend. We were there at around 9:30am on a Saturday at the tail end of the Chinese new year holidays. Since we already had tickets, we need not queue and were able to take the cable car ride almost immediately. When we came down from the cable car at around noon, the lines that had formed were unbelievably long already."

Early morning 9am, I took the longest cable car ride to arrive at Ngong Ping Village. I was greeted with lots of interesting shops selling traditional and modern art crafts, food stalls selling snacks and familiar brands like Starbucks. I would recommend to take a stroll through these stalls just to soak in the atmosphere of the unique setting of the village on such height and peaceful surrounding. Continuing on towards the Big Buddha, the challenge of the steps came. The challenge was the slippery steps but it was all worth it for the magnificent view of the sculptures. There was time before my vegetarian meal so I went to the path of Wisdom which is hard to tell which is the path to start but the friendly locals are always willing to guide you. A couple who goes there for daily workout took me not only to the Path of Wisdom but also to the Sunset Peak. Oh my! that breath taking sight and of course the hike for the weak urban dweller took my breath away too! The path to the Sunset Peak is at a split to Path of Wisdom which is an easier hike. After the hike, I am all ready for my one-man meal! But my observation tells me that the more people you eat with the better the variety. However my vegetarian meal is still very yummy! the best was the fried spring roll which was crispy on the outside and crunchy on the inside. I took a bus ride over to Tai O via Bus 21 which took about 20 minutes to get there.I followed the bridge over the silt houses and chanced upon the famous Lor Mai Chi (\u7cef\u7c73\u7ccd) and \u8336\u679c (cha kwo) which have many flavors so I bought a few to try. It was so good that I also had them as my breakfast. The bean filling tasted like Singapore's Ang Ku Kueh. I did not take the dolphin tour as I have read reviews and asked many which feedback that they did not manage to see any and I spent more time walking around which led me to cover the area for more interesting sight and food. From Old Man rock to the other end of the lookout pavillion, I covered within 2hours. Since I was alone, I managed to move quickly around and covered the both Ngong Ping and Tai O by 3pm. So I had the option to go to another part of the island but I choose to return to the main island and cover other destination in the evening. In summary this is a great island for outdoor lovers, children to see a simpler lifestyle and foodie!"

I found it hard to find reviews on this hike so hopefully this will help anyone wanting to know more.The path is a bit tricky to find as it is not near the start of the cable car. If you google run lily blog spot there are some good directions. I printed these and showed them to the locals who were really helpful. Take exit A from the metro and when you leave the station head in 2/3o'clock direction up the slope. You want to he headwind towards the fire station & hospital but then need to get on the far side of the estate of flats. From there it's off on the bike path to the right to find the path.The first part of the path is pretty steep with lots & lots & lots of stairs!! Think about 100 flights! There are 30 markers and once on the path it is really well marked. There is a wooden stretch part way up which includes slopes and stairs. I wouldn't recommend doing this if it has rained hard as it was very slippy when I went. If you are determined to go anyway, hike up but get the cable car down. I planned on hiking both ways but decided I'd be on my butt slipping on the wood if I tried to come down...although it is really well maintained, think slippy decking with algae on it. The rest of the path is stone & concrete so the underfoot grip is fine. It's 5.7km & my Fitbit had it down as about 200 flights of climbing in total (100 on the first bit then it eases off more). It's not all stairs, plenty of flat bits & slopes too. Took me 2.5 hours & I'm reasonably fit. It is well worth it & very rewarding. You may see other people on the path but not many. If you can make it out in my pics. The white looking building near the open water in the first pic which looks a bit like Sydney opera house is where the metro & cable car are. You will need to be heading away from this to the right, past the estate of flats & past a little playground to get to the green bridge which you can just make out in my second pic if you enlarge it. Look under the hill to the right of the buildings.....in the foreground of the cranes... Once you get there to the bridge it's very easy! There's also a very clean public toilet right by the playground area which I didn't expect! Happy to help with any questions"

We caught the local bus from Tung Chung (only tourists n bus), then sat in local cafe for lunch, followed by walk around the beach area where locals were having bbq's and enjoying a Sunday outing."

Long times ago, most people living there was fisherman, they built their houses on the seashore. Even now, there are a lot of houses builing onto the sea. Tai O is a village where give you calm and relax, you can see the living style of old village people there. Along the Tai O main street, there is a lot of restaurant and some shops selling snack which it cannot be found in anywhere other than Hong Kong. Moreover, if you have time, take a small boat to see the Dophins, the trip is not expensive, around HK$30 per head."

It's popular with tourists but not as crowded or chaotic as the city. Go early to take the cable car but be prepared to suffer in a loooong lineup on the way back down. Spend the day; take your time. Climb up to the Big Buddha, visit the Po Lin Monastery and the vegetarian restaurant for some small treats, and get on that bus to Tai O.

The buses are bumpier, the views are more natural, and the ferry is a common mode of transportation to visit smaller outer islands or to get back to Hong Kong Island. It's also where Disneyland and the airport are, but I'm not going to Disneyland and everyone goes to the airport. There are mountain trails to hike, cable cars to ride, Big Buddhas to admire, outlying fishing villages to walk around, parks and temples to explore and good food to eat!

We took the ferry across and immediately made our way toward a Mexican restaurant at the port. It's pretty darn bueno, but that's hardly one of the major attractions in Lantau. We really had no clue what to do so we wandered into the tour office next door and the sweet lady gave us a map and an easy itinerary I'll share with you. We took the 100 bus to the Tai O fishing village. The busses are comfy tour-type with a/c and you get a nice tour of the island. Tai O is a cool place to wander around and spend maybe two hours going through the market, taking pics, and checking out the little houses on stilts. Not really a lot of eating options other than street snacks - good thing we had those fish tacos. You can take a boat ride from here, but we were short on time (see 'late start.') From there we caught a cab because the next bus was 40 minutes and the sun was starting to go down. We went to the big Tian Tan Buddah where there's a little shopping village and a lot of stairs to climb up to the buddah. We skipped the stairs for a stop at Starbucks (again, late night), but you can clearly see the buddah and be impressed by its size from far below. You can also get a pretty cool view from the cable car. We bought a ticket for a glass bottom car, but I don't really think it was worth it. It's not that much more, but it's not THAT high and there's really nothing to see below but trees and water. The idea of it was better than the reality. The cable car runs down to the other side of the island from where the ferry dropped us off and from there you can take the train right back into Hong Kong Island. There's also a massive outlet mall you can hit before getting on the train. It's a perfect loop and an easy day trip to get out of the city. We saw lots of nice walking trails and beaches that would be a relaxing way to kill some time on a warmer day."

A good path all the way, a few steep climbs but if you enjoy walking and are up for the challenge it will be worth the effort. Shady most of the way.

When we got here, the ticket counter line stretched to nearly 200 metres. You will waste your day and tire if you wait in line. Unfortunately it\u2019s a \u201cmoney talks\u201d kind of scenario. You will be paying a premium to bypass all the inconveniences along the way. The package gets you the cable car ride, a bus trip and a short boat ride to the south china sea. The cable car ride is fantastic. The views are great and no amount of pictures can help you experience the journey to the Buddha statue. The bus trip is just to get to the village and is a timed affair which ends at the statue. The guide is the usual, corny English joke cracking character. You won\u2019t remember anything he says but will remember his antics. The boat ride was good. Went through a housing colony set up on the banks in stilt houses which opened out to the sea. The boat had life jackets under the seats. But the speed boat is a tad small and fast moving so I found it a little uncomfortable without a life jacket on me. There are a few coupons that you get as part of the package which you can use in the restaurants and souvenir shops on the other side. Before you embark on the journey, please parcel some food for you and your gang. We packed a lot of rolls from Ebeneezers which turned out to be a life saver. There\u2019s nothing decent to eat on the other side. Non-locals will find it difficult. There is a market where you can get decent quality souvenirs like magnets etc for cheap. I communicated (read bargained) with one such elderly shop owner using just numbers and got a good deal (I think).The Buddha statue is the grand draw and that is where most of the crowds head to. In HK this is a must do according to me."

The landscape is very very scenic. The other way is to go by MTR and drop at Tung Chung station and from there took a cable car ride which cost around 165 hkd.. or hire the bus cost around 22 hkd.Reaching is time taking in both the ways as it is one of the farthest from HK city but must visit. There is vegetarian restaurant in Lantau for eating. To reach near the statue one needs to step up around 220 stairs which is manageable as these stairs are designed in this fashion as one can take rest between them."

Travel there quickly by MTR and book the one way Cable Car online for the first and early ride up is worth it to experience it ahead of the crowds. After get a bus down to Tai O or to the Mui Wo ferry back to HK. Either way the bus ride a good way to see the island. I did both and got bus back to Tung Chung for the MTR back. All is possible because of the cheap, frequent buses so just pitch in its all doable in a day if you want."

We booked our tickets in advance (I would definitely recommend booking online previous) and arrived early without many lines. If you are able to go to the Big Buddha on the first trams out, and spend only a couple hours there, you are likely to get a cabin all by yourself on the ride back. Consider booking a regular cabin on your way out to the Big Buddha and a crystal cabin return, this will allow you (the chance) to have a private crystal cabin. You'll want pictures sitting on the floors, etc.. So it's better to have the crystal cabin to yourself! The grounds upon arrival are very clean and manicured.

As you research about heading there especially to see the Big Buhhda keep in mind how busy these places get. Yes we thought we had left early enough for our day trip to Lantau, but we were caught up in the line up for over one and a half hours just to buy our tickets. On our return leaving around 2.30pm we went through the same situation. So all in all we loved the trip to Lantau, seeing the Buddha and spending time there amongst the quaint shops and having lunch but we would definitely suggest you pre purchase your tickets.

            "review": "The Big Buddha is the big draw.. but there are other things to check out.... Some tips: 1) Best way is to take the MTR (follow the maps to check which trains to change etc.) - MTR Hong Kong is among the best metro systems in the world (comparable to London and Berlin in terms of efficiency, if not size). It is cheap and relatively quick (yes, you can take a taxi which will save time but it will also cost more). 2) Once you get down at the last stop, walk out of the station, cross a couple of main streets and take a bus to Nong Pning.. note that, that bus stop is a little bit hard to figure out. You may see crowds everywhere and don't know where to wait for the bus. But, just follow the signs and you will get to where bus for Nong Pning stops - it is the second set of lines. Yes, especially over a weekend, there will be many people and the line itself will be long enough that you may have to wait for 2-3 buses to come and leave. But the wait is much shorter than you would wait, if you took the ropeway. 3) Over a Sunday, the bus fare is 27 HK Dollars. Note that you will need exact change (in case you don't have a prepaid ticket or an Octopus card - which you can use anbywhere in the train + bus system in HK). Else, they will make you pay for more and you will not get the change ack. On a another day of the week, the fare is 10 HKD cheaper (as of 2015 of course). 4) The ropeway is nice.. but it is too pricey (I think).. and the lines are 5 times longer than you would wait at the bus stop (especially over the weekend). It is better to take the bus up and the ropeway down (but then you might lose money - because, the round trip ropeway is only slightly more expensive (or even similar) than 2 one ways - one by bus and one by ropeway. 5) Once you get down from the bus - there is the really beautiful monastery to check out (with 1000 Buddha statues) and of course the Big Buddha upto which there are around 280 or so steps. (Some people say that there are 256 steps but I counted a few more!). 6) If possible, go as early in the morning as possible. That way, not only will you beat the crowds but you will also have the Sunlight ON the face of the Buddha and not the rear side. We were too delayed getting out of the hotel and so, by the time we reached, it was afternoon and did not get too many good photo opportunities with the really bright Sun belting down on the rear side of the largest standing Buddha in the world. Having said that, it is really peaceful up there and there are several great photo spots you will get - just not with Lord Buddha's countenance. 6) There are cute little traditional villages in Lantau. You can check those out if you are not pressed for time... Again, if you start your trip early, you can check out at least one of these hamlets and shop around, check out beaches etc. It is quite incredible that within 2 hours of travel time from one of the hubs of global commerce are these quaint little villages which, largely sustain themselves the same way as they have done for centuries. Worth checking out. What else.. well, if I remember something later, I will edit the same. But I hope these tips will help the traveler."

The crystal cabin in a bit more expensive but still we went with that option. A little bit scary at first but the glass bottom allows a 360 degree view experience. I am little afraid of heights, but I would still recommend. Lantau Island is an amazing place where you can stay up to 5 hours. Climb the stairs to see the Buddha closer and take some photos of it. This is one of the 5 largest Buddha statues in China called Tian Tan Buddha which is impressively 34 m tall, weights 250 tons and it\u2019s made of bronze. Keep in mind, the Big Buddha is 268 stairs up!We had a great time but were worn out afterwards. We experienced a 90 minute wait to get back on the cable car back home. To avoid long waits, try purchasing your tickets ahead of time. We saw many people bypassing the lines because the already had vouchers. Cheers!"

Advance purchase of tickets may have saved me on hour, so I would recommend it. The cable car ride was worth the wait, with amazing views. Once there don't miss out on the 100budda main temple. From there I highly recommended escaping the crowds and hopping on a bus to Tai O. Buses are cheap, take Oyster cards and leave regularly. Tai O is a beautiful fishing village with great walks."

            "review": "Tung O Ancient Trail. This is a heritage hike from Tung Chung to Tai O, stretching over 16 km. This route was once an important passage for villagers to commute between Tung Chung and Tai O. A good part of this trail follows the coast, passes mangroves and bays, and ends at the quaint fishing village of Tai O. We read about this trail from 'Your Guide to Hiking & Cycling in Hong Kong', a HK Tourism Board publication. Make sure you get a copy before leaving the airport.To begin your hike, take the MTR to Tung Chung Station. Get out at Exit B, walk for a couple of minutes to Tung Chung Fire Station. Walk down Yu Tung Road passing Yat Tung Estate, and at near the end, turn right and follow the signage to Hau Wong Temple. We had to ask a passerby for direction because it wasn't clear which way we should walk from the fire station. There are toilet facilities along the route, and even replenishing stations for us to catch our breath. We enjoyed the bean curd sold at one of the stalls. Even with the availability of food and drinks, remember to stock up on water because it is a long route.Although this hike is classified as 'Fairly Easy' in the guide booklet, do not be deceived. Some slopes are rather steep. In fact, we found this hike more challenging than the 'Moderately Difficult' Dragon's Back trail, partly because the Tung O trail is a lot longer. A hiking stick would help.Continue walking and you would end up at Tai O fishing village, Spend some time roaming the alleys of this village. Try the local snacks and even partake in a seafood meal. Prices are not cheap though.Once you have had enough of Tai O, you can take Bus 11 from the bus terminus back to the MTR Tung Chung Station. Alternatively, you could do like what we did - head for Mui Wo on Bus 1. Mui Wo was Lantau's largest settlement before Tung Chung was born.Expect to spend about 5 hours for the trail."

The attractions near the Big Buddha close at 6:30pm. Therefore, you will NOT have time to relax and enjoy the lovely tourist village on top of the mountain. The ticketing company puts out signs saying \"75 Minute Wait\"...this is A BLATANT DECEPTION...from the queue starting point down on the road, it takes over TWO HOURS just to get to the ticketing office. From there you have to join another queue to wait another TWO HOURS to then board a gondola. Just like a Disney theme park...they entice you to keep waiting because you turn many corners and cannot see all of the queue in front of you!!!If you live in Hong Kong...no problem...you can always return. However...if you are a tourist, then it means that you will spend most of your day waiting in a queue for a 15 minute gondola ride. CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY. Then...getting OFF the mountain is almost as bad...!!! There is another TWO HOUR queue to return on a gondola to Tung Chung. OR...you can line up for a bus....the buses are good and come every 15-20 minutes, but there is no sign explaining this to the public, so people have no idea how long they have to queue and get very anxious and frustrated. If there are 200-300 people in the queue, then you have to wait a long time to actually get on a bus...!!!SUGGESTION - GO EARLY. DO NOT QUEUE AFTER 10am ON WEEKENDS!!!"

Lantau Island mainly consists of 3 areas of attraction - Mui Wo (mainly a beach, a trail, a small waterfall, a 4m wide cave), Ngong Ping (where the Po Lin monastery, Tian Tan Buddha, Wisdom path, Lantau trail are), and Tai O fishing Village. If you hope to do all of these in a day, you should set off early. I took the 8+am ferry from Central Pier to Mui wo, and spent a few hours chilling at the beach. I then headed for the waterfall which was underwhelming, but you can get onto the rocks and take a nice photo. I would strongly recommend renting a bicycle for Mui Wo, the roads are flat and you would get around so much faster instead of walking 30mins to get from the beach to the falls. I then took a bus to Ngong Ping (Po Lin monastery says the sign at the bus terminal) which was maybe 40minutes? Headed to Po Lin monastery for a quick look and a meal. Do try the beancurd dessert there. Although I went on a Tuesday, the Buddha area was rather packed with tourists. I didn't go up stairs to the Buddha, and then headed to the Wisdom Path. I absolutely enjoyed the walk and it's very peaceful. There is a small dirt path upslope at the Wisdom Path where it's a lookout spot to see the Buddha's back view. Afterwhich, I walked through to Ngong Ping village for the bus to Tai O. It leaves frequently even on weekdays. Tai O is a fishing village crucial to HK and it is still a famous area for villagers. It is famous for its stilt houses, seafood, egglets (similar to waffles) made with charcoal grill instead of gas, prawn paste, the old police station turned heritage hotel, and dolphin watching tours (25 minutes for 20HKD).Although I didn't get to see dolphins during the Nov period, I have friends who have seen the Chinese dolphins on the boat tours in May. There is a straight bus from Tai O to Tung Chung bus terminal (MTR station). However, if you are leaving at 5pm onwards, the queue for the bus can be long. You are likely to miss a few buses (freq 10-20mins for peak). However, I would recommend you stay a little later because the street market comes alive in the evening and even watch the sunset on the island/boat ride)"

One of the key attractions on this island is the temple and the huge statue. You can have a vegetarian meal there too for a unique experience. Other places on the island worth a visit would be Tai-O and Mui Wo for a throwback to the fishing villages of HK in the early days."

Gorgeous place with the giant Buddha looking over everyone. Well worth the visit. Fury little shops in the village and then a fantastic ride to the outlet shopping centre on the cable car, not brave enough to do the crystal bottom one tho! Then took the MTR back to HK Island!"

There are many trails to choose at different levels of difficulty and time . My favourites are Tung Chung to Tai O , Tung Chung to Mui Wo and Pui O to Mui Wo . I suggest buying The Hiking Trails of Hong Kong Books to get more info.There are fantastic views, lush vegetation , waterfalls , cascading streams, old Villages,The odd water buffalo, birds etc . All hiking trails are well posted."

Enjoyed the food so much in Hong Kong in particular, Dim Sum and also the famous roasted goose. We had a fantastic evening at Lan Kwai Fong, a place one should not miss if you happened to be in Hong Kong. It was extremely crowded that night because of Halloween night. The half day city tour that covers the Peak and cruising the harbour where the Jumbo Floating Restaurant is located reminded me of my first time visit to Hong Kong about 30 years ago. Another place one should not miss to visit is to Lantau Island to see the big Buddha and also to the fishing village in Tai O for nice seafood. You can travel there by Cable car or by bus. I choose to travel by bus."

These are worth a visit before or after you ride the cable car. Walk to the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car station. This was about 10.00am at this stage and the ques were long we waited an hour all up before we got into a cable car. We caught the normal standard car not the glass floor and the views were breathtaking. It rides very high, but is nice and slow and steady. It goes a long way 5.7 klms ride. You stop at the little village with plenty of little restaurants quiet a good variety of western and asian food. Some gift shops and good amenities. We walked our way onto the Big Buddha and climbed up all the steps. There was plenty of resting platforms. We then made our way to the Po lin Monastery with its rich gold buddhas and amazing architecture and beautiful ceilings etc. There is a vegetarian restaurant just beside the monastery run by the monks should you wish to try it.We missed the Wisdom Path.From here we made our way back to the village area and there is a Local Bus Station.We made our way to Toi O Fishing Village where the houses are sitting on stilts in water.There you can take a little boat ride byone of the locals. Theres also the little Toi O village of little shops selling their dried food goods etc. You get more of the real Chinese fishing village custom here. We caught the bus back to the Ngong Ping Village where the big buddha is. And from there we rode the Cable Car back to Tung Chung. This trip was well worth it today."

It is also home to the International Air Port, Disneyland and new high-rise developments to the north of the island. But it is well worth a visit and here's an idea for a day trip to Lantau.1. Take the MTR Tung Shun Line all the way to Tung Shun.2. Take the cable car to Ngong Ping for the Po Ling Monastary and Big Buddha (both reviewed separately)3. Take the Bus (hourly) to Tai O village.4. Take an inexpensive boat trip to see the wooden-stilt houses along the waterfront and, on a good day, the pink dolphins out in the bay.5. Wander through the village with its market and tiny shops and along the shore line to the Old Police Station perched on the cliff-side.6. Tea and cheesecake would be my recommendation at the Old Police Station, but a wide range of refreshments are available.7. Walk back to the village and take the bus back to Tung Shun and the MTR back to Hong Kong City for a bit of night life.Tip: It's far cheaper to do this trip for yourself than pay the HK$830 for a guided tour, and with a good guide book, you will miss nothing."

From there take Exit B at and head to the far left hand corner of the square for the cable car terminal to the island itself. The cable car journey lasts around twenty minutes, standard car costs 165 HK Dollars. I booked it online a week or so in advance and printed off my ticket at home. The queue for tickets at 09:30 hours today was already around 30-40 people and it was good to avoid this (at 13:00 hours it must have been in excess of 200). I obviously went to the Big Budda once on the island, but one of the quieter places was the 'wisdom trail' the start of which is only a ten minute walk from it and the views are spectacular."

Experience can be weather dependent, but we took the ferry out here in winter when it was a bit misty and not too warm, but still had a lovely experience. The island is beautiful, the scenery spectacular with lush, rolling hills and dramatic landscapes. The contrast with the busy districts of the city made this very welcome as a day trip. The harbour where we got off from the ferry had a number of good places to eat with different cuisines, and we took a bus from there to the buddhist monastery with the big statue. The tourist village next to the monastery is terribly tacky and kitsch but has a range of places to eat and a number of services. The cable car ride down to the metro station takes in some beautiful scenery and is worth having to walk through the tourist trap fake village (and the hours of queuing!)."

Leave the shops to the end. Whilst walking to the Buddha, stop by where you hear nice meditation music (just after the shops) and just enjoy the moment - it'll get you into the perfect mood. Lantau is not just about the Big Buddha though. After visiting it, take a short bus or taxi ride (20/10 min) to Tai O village. Taxi ride is cca 55-60 HKD one way but the bus is also ok and much cheaper (cca 7HKD one way and you can use your Octopus card too). Tai O is a must see. Make sure you read about the history of this little yet amazing fishing village so that you'll understand why and how people live there. You can even get a sneak peek of their life as you walk by as they live it with open doors. I absolutely loved my short time there and you get to see HK from a different angle, no skyscrapers, beautiful nature and absolutely authentic. From Tai O you can go back to Ngong Ping and finish your day with some shopping and by getting a coffee and a free wifi code you can even share these moments with your loved ones back home.Lantau has definitely more to it but I only had a short time and I must say I loved every minute of it."

(2) Alternatively less aggressive hikers can go on the Tung Chung - Tai O Trail for a relatively flat hike for 5 hrs (about 12 km) on the island's northwest section facing the airport's runway and the Pearl River's mouth. (3) At the end of the somewhat flat trail is Tai O, an old fishing village with stilted houses on the water. (4) Or one can pass the hike above to take the public bus from Tung Chung to crawl over the mountains with numerous hairpin turns to the south side of beaches for a swim, and then crawl over again to Tai O.(5) After seeing the stilted houses at Tai O, one could take another bus to Mui Wo along the Island's south side to catch the ferry to Central back to the city hence completing the tour round the island.The above is a very full day or two, the latter if one includes one of the above two hikes."

The bronze statue of Buddha, and the monastery being the landmarks. Must visit, as this is unlike any other attraction you will see in Hong Kong."

We were transported from the village we had arrived at, by an air conditioned bus, down to the Tai O Fishing village.

Beaches, hiking, many restaurants and traditional fishing villages and communities can be found there. Throw in the big Buddha and you have an island that has a lot to offer for tourists and is well worth a visit. You also have hotels and village houses that can be rented out so an over night opr a few days stay is also possible. Consider a visit if you're spending a few days in Hong Kong."

Many uninhabited or home to small communities but Lantau is one of the major islands. It is full of fascinating contrasts and worth setting aside a half day visit. Start your exploration at the Outlying Islands Ferry Piers in front of the IFC and catch one of the cheap and reasonable priced ferries used by the islanders.The Lantau ferry departs from Central Pier 6 every half hour from early morning to late at night to Mui Wo (Silvermine Bay) from where you can catch buses if required to all parts of the island.Lantau is still tranquil despite the additions of the Hong Kong International Airport or Hong Kong Disneyland, so do not be put off as half the island is protected parkland. Hikers amongst you there is a 43 mile circular trail! Beach lovers there is the beautiful white sands Cheung Sha Beach, so take the No 2 bus or a taxi. The island is noted for its famous and world's tallest bronze statue of Buddha - 73ft (23m) Tian Tan Buddha. This can be reached by bus from Mui Wo or the Ngong Ping cable car. In other words, there should be something on the island for everyone and it is such a contrast to life in Hong Kong - try it."

The trail is long, it took me about 5 hours to get to the top but it was on an extremely hot day with little cover so I had to walk quite slowly. I think on a cooler day you can probaly cut an hour or 1.5 hrs off depending on your level of fitness, it is very steep in parts. Make sure you take plenty of water if you decide to walk this.

The Big Buddha is absolutely majestic, sitting peacefully on the mountain watching over Hong Kong. There are a lot of little shops, restaurants and cafes in the village when you get up there - it's a little touristy but also handy to be able to grab a drink or quick bite to eat.The biggest tip would be to look at pre-booking a ticket for the cable car as the queues are HUGE, maybe that it just a weekend thing (we went on a Sunday). Luckily we had time on our side but we were waiting around for ages (well over an hour on the way up and about 45 minutes to get down again) - it seemed that some groups were with an \"agent\" and were able to bypass the exceptionally long queues so if we went again we would definitely pay a bit extra for that convenience."

Then take a bus to Nan Shan Campsite, it's only a few stops from the ferry terminal. There is a great trail from Nan Shan Campsite to Tai Tung Shan, 2-3 hours, very nice views, no shades though, so bring water and don't do it in summer unless you are really fit for it (risk of heatstroke). The first half is mostly up but not steep, so you do not have to be very fit to do it, can pace yourself. About the middle there are some stone huts, apparently some locals lived there during WWII, and if you know the right people, you can get keys to the huts and camp out there: I've seen a westerner family there on one hike, kids and all, the views are unbeatable, but it's rough, you have to bring water and everything. The second half is mostly down and steep steps so would be a problem if you have bad knees (bring walking sticks). The trail finishes at the road, where you can take a bus to Tai O: buses are not too frequent so expect to wait a bit (15 mins). Tai O is interesting: like a shabby version of Venice I guess, instead of palaces you get shabby huts on stilts and the water can get quite smelly depends on the tide. Some small local restaurants where you can get seafood, nothing spectacular but you've got to eat something right.The other must do in Lantau is the Buddha, a world-class sight. Another trail you can do is hike to the Buddha: take MTR to Tung Chung, you need to figure out how to get from MTR station to the start of the trail, it's 10-15 mins through some housing estate. The trail was built for transporting construction materials when then build the cable car (I was told they use donkeys, like in Santorini?), so the trail actually follows the path of the cable car. The best part is towards the end whether you catch glimpses of the Buddha."

You can have almost the same views without too, Visit the Big Buddha and then take a bus to Mui Wo (runs every 30 min) and come back to HK with a ferry. And stop in the meanwhile in some other sights when keen. The beaches have some big waves so Stanley is a much better option for a nice swim. And Stanley has also showers which Lantau does not provide so much. So Lantau is mainly nice to see from the cable car, visit the Buddha and come back with a ferry. Kids probably like the Disneyland too."

You will be able to take the cable car to Po Lin Monastery, view the stilt houses by boat and explore the fishing village. I took the one day tour with Grayline Tours and felt satisfied that I was able to view all that I wanted to see on the Island, which is fairly small in size and population. If you are limited on time and can't view all the attractions, the cable car is definitely a must as the view is quite spectacular. However, the line is long if you are not with a tour group."

It's a suburb of Hong Kong where lots of people live due to more affordably rental prices. So you can experience the real Hong Kong life. We even talked two really interesting business travellers (Germans) at the table next to us... Our plane left late in the evening, and we could have stayed longer..."

So on our return trip to Hong Kong we were keen to do the Cable Car from Tung Chung to Lantau Island.We booked our tickets on line before we left and were glad we did as even by 10am on a weekday there was a substantial line up for tickets and we were able to skip that queue. We also booked a Crystal Cabin which has the glass bottom and really added to the Cable Car experience. Even though when booking on line you specify a time, basically you just line up in the Crystal Cabin queue when you get there and they fill the cars as they come past.The views from the Cable Car ride are spectacular and the ride goes for around 25 minutes or so. You pass over the water and lush greenery with stunning views of the nearby airport, Tung Chung and Lantau Island.We didn't venture far once on Lantau Island having done most of the attractions there before, but we did enjoy some shopping in the small Ngong Ping village area before the return Cable Car trip. For our return trip we had a Crystal Cabin all to ourselves which made the experience even better, since we could freely move around and take photographs. Once we got back to Tung Chung we could not believe how long the queues for both tickets and for boarding the actual Cable Cars were, I'd suggest book online and go early to avoid the queues."

I had my reservations about coming here after seeing the size of the queue to the cable car, the whole time my friend was moaning about the size of it and wanted to go elsewhere. I am glad I waited, because it was probably one of the best places I have seen in Hong Kong. The cable car was amazing. We selected the glass car. We could see the water below us. I loved the chopstick gallery shop here as well as the template. What I found interesting is that if you went to the meal area and specified a vegetarian option, you where given a plate of noodles and donuts. A healthy choice to be sure.A few things to note. My friend was taking pictures of the statues, which caused offense, but they didn't make a big issue of it. There are signs posted all over about not taking pictures in certain areas, so there is no excuse for being ignorant."

I explored the monastery, the Giant Buddha, did the Wisdom Path walk which is highly thought provoking, ate a fantastic vegetarian meal, went shopping at Piong Ning and finally got my Monkey King opera mask (tick on my bucket list). The bus ride up revealed to me that there are beaches on this island that are now on my bucket list to try out, and I am hoping to return one day to do the Lantau Trail as a day hike. Got the bus back down to Mui Wo. I recommend that you eat and drink at the restaurants to the left of the ferry station, food is great and the drinks are cheaper than the western style pub on the waterfront (avoid this place. Im not naming and shaming). Enjoyed the evening ferry ride back to Hong Kong."

The fifteen minute cable car ride offers some awesome views of the airport and surrounding islands which would look even better on a clear day! Once you arrive at Ngong Ping, the village you first walk through seems quite fake and touristy with all its gift shops and restaurants but once you get to the Tian Tian Buddha statue at the centre of the island, you're instantly brought back into Asian Buddhist culture! The statue is the centre piece of the island and is very photogenic from any distance or angle. There's also the Buddhist monastery nearby the statue where entry is free and you can see some really interesting artefacts and building designs! Finally the Ngong walking trail is a fairly easy trek through forests and up some very twisty hills which offer fantastic views of the various mountains and valleys of Lantau. If you want to complete the trail however, save yourself some time beforehand because it can take up to three hours! Overall though it's a fantastic day out and a must see if you're visiting Hong Kong!"

Lantau experience for me, tells something about the rich culture of Chinese people and one of the biggest if not, the biggest religion of Chinese.

First thing to note is the incredibly hot, muggy weather during July. Traveling from Okinawa, we expected the same tropical, humid weather however HK must be reigning king of humidity. Umbrellas, sun block, and water are a must (we used camelbaks as our water source so that we wouldn't be lugging around bottles). (detailed travel below)Our travel began at about 10 a.m. from the Yau Ma Tei neighborhood in Kowloon via the MTR. Travel was easy (Tsuen Wan Line MTR: Yau Mai Tei < Lai King then transfer to Tung Chung Line MTR < Tung Chung). Follow the short distance to the cable car (signs everywhere). We decided to travel one way on a standard cabin and returned via bus to Tung Chung followed by the MTR to our hotel. The cable car ride is about 25 minutes but is worth it. My wife, who is scared of heights, also enjoyed it; no winds and amazing views!). The cable cars get filled with up to 8 people so don't think you will get your own cable car. We then arrived in Ngong Ping 360 (separate reviews) and walked to Ngong Ping Village. After doing research, we decided that we wouldn't waste our time in Ngong Ping Village due to their high prices (tourist trap). As much as we wanted to stop we stayed focused on walking through it without any stops. At the end of the village, we took our trek up the 268 stairs to get to the Big Buddha (separate review). The view were amazing with green lush everywhere. Before you ascend the stairs there is a small area where they seem to be selling tickets however don't be fooled into thinking that you have to pay to visit the buddha. What you pay for is to go inside the buddha and end up receiving a water and ice pop at the top (well worth going inside where you can cool down with cold AC after the heat).We did not walk around to the paths others recommend since we arrived later than we anticipated and instead walked back to the village where the public buses are located. We caught a bus to Tai O Village (worth it and separate review) then caught a bus all the way back to Tung Chung (about 35-40 minute drive). Once back at Tung Chung, we caught the MTR back to our place."

To stand right below the huge statue of Buddha, is a very incredible experience. During this trip to Asia I saw the reclining Buddha, the Emerald Buddha and many more, in different sizes and of different material,. They were all beautiful, but only this one will remain vivid in my memory because of his majesty and the fervor of the people that worship it. "

The tour also provided more information about everything to see at the top.At the top you will find The Big Buddha, Po Lin Monastery, Ngong Ping Piazza and the Wisdom Path that will satisfy your exploring curiosity. Make sure you go on a clear day as the Big Buddha can be coved in clouds because of the altitude.

Outside the temple there are lots of cafes from various chains too if you don't want vegetarian. The Big Buddha is very impressive, try and pick a day when it is not too cloudy to see it at its best.

And of course visit the Big Buddha and also taste vegetarian food. If you want to eat seafood or visit a bar in the evening, you can go to Lantau Pier and near the pier there are also small inns which tourists like to have short stay. You can also go to Tai O, which is a fishing village and you could spend a night there and enjoy its peaceful and beautiful environment. Besides, you can also go to Tung Chung where there is shopping outlet and after shopping, you can enjoy afternoon tea in a comfortable hotel. Of course, you can also take a bus ride to tour around the area or in Ngong Ping 360 which gives you an aerial view of Lantau. All in all, Lantau is a wonderful place you cannot miss when visiting Hong Kong."

I took the Crystal cabin to and back from the Island. The cable car itself was a 25 Min ride and it was so serene and beautiful. The day i choose to visit was slightly misty with a light drizzle, but that didnt take away anything from the mystical experience of the place. If anything it added to the whole experience. Once you reach the top, you have shops and restaurants complete with a starbucks. Keep walking and you reach the big Buddha. Do not miss having lunch at the Monastery. I think the whole experience was simply beautiful. Climb up to the buddha itself was not a challenege. I'm not sure older people and parents with toddlers/ infants can do the climb, but other wise pretty much everyone else can. And while you;re here - DO NOT MISS THE WISDOM PATH. It was a serene walk and i could understand how it got its name."

You can take a Tran ride high in the sky from Hong Kong Island to Lantau Island for about 25 mins. You will be very high up! Its a nice ride when the sunshine if up, but when the sun is going down and the winds pickup, it's pretty cold on the ride back down. Even if its 100 F outside, bring a small something to cover up if you get back in the early evening, especially if you have kids with you. It's an amazing view and you wonder how is the world did they get the cable car of this high! Or you can take a local Bus from downtown from the Bus Terminal and you get the scenic view going through neighborhoods and seaside ride with lots of turns and zig-zag roads. My brother was scare of heights so we took this method and it was just fine to see another view of the Island. We you arrive, there are some street vendors outside the park area. I liked that they were not pushy. Inside the park is a beautiful design of sculptures, huge Buddhas in Chinese pavilions on the grounds. Some shops for tourists and places to eat both local Chinese fare and western-style meals. The main attraction is this monster-side Buddha that is on top of a hill overlooking the horizon. How do you get up to there to greet it? You walk up about \"20 Flight of Stairwells\" straight up to the heavens! There are a few open crossover points along the way for those of us who 'get it' that this is a longgggggggggg flight up!!! And it's a very longggggggggg way back down! Even my athletic sister felt it the next day. : ( It's the perfect place to take beautiful pics of family & friends and the scenic sites. You will get a workout walking around. It's a very beautiful place. A nice side trip if you are lucky enough to have the top to go. The arts at it's best!"

Our plane arrived around 8, so instead of going into the city right away, we rode the S1 shuttle to the tram station, left our bags and rode the cable car to Lantau Island. If you can, get the clear bottom + regular combination! Also, buy your tickets ahead - the line to buy one of the spot was extremely long.We explored the nearby temple and climbed up the steps to the buddha. For lunch we had sticks of fried fish balls, but there are places there with more filling fare. There's even a subway, but we were full from the fish balls.The baggage storage was expensive though - more expensive than we thought. Perhaps it would be cheaper in the mall next to the station, but if you're on a schedule, it's better than having to leave your bags and then go back."

The big disappointment was that the cable car was shut down for several days for periodic maintenance. we were notified about the shutdown and the tour company offered alternatives, but we couldn't find a different one that met our interest and schedule.My guidance is to be aware whether the cable cars are running and knowledgeable about likely weather obscuring the view of the Big Buddha from below due to clouds. The Big Buddha is still worthwhile in the clouds (entry to the inside of the Buddha is permitted, but the view from below is extraordinary if you get a clear view."

I took the package but it should be noted that you can travel to the monastery and the Tai O fishing village by bus from the bus station next door to the cable car station.The views from the cable car were spectacular - you can see the airport from above as well as the foliage covered hills, the sea and some of the Nine Dragons.On arrival you enter a reproduction village which is basically shops and food outlets. Our guide met us and transferred us by bus to the Tai O village which was interesting but felt a little intrusive as these are people's actual homes! A boat trip around the village and out into the bay was included and after that there was time to explore the village with its fish market and temple. There are caf\u00e9s and restaurants if you have time.Another bus transfer to the temple and the stairway to the Buddha. The monks were holding a service and chanting which was beautiful and we visited the recently opened new temple with its Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas which was stunning - no photography allowed.There are a couple of attractions back in the initial village but I didn't bother.Overall interesting but at certain times of the year the weather could spoil the experience."

Pilgrims from all over the world pay homage to Tian Tan Buddha whose right hand is being raised to deliver a blessing to all. Visitors must climb up 268 steps in order to reach the Buddha. On top, six smaller bronze statues will be seen which is known as \"The Offering of the Six Devas\", posing offering of flowers, incense, lamp, ointment, fruit, and music to the Buddha. Overlooking the Big Buddha is the Po Lin Monastery. This is Hong Kong's largest Buddhist temple but it's not as big as Singapore's Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. But in here, I found the largest joss sticks ever! This monastery plays a major role for Hong Kong's Buddhist pilgrimage. The main temple houses three bronze statues of Buddha representing his past, present, and future lives. A row of eateries is conveniently located inside the monastery complex for hungry visitors coming down from the Big Buddha."

The trails are marked to the peak and along the way you will see flower encrusted slopes with colorful butterflies that were uncountable on my hike that began in the morning taking a ferry from Central Pier No. 5 on HK Island to the Silvermine Beach ferry dock. On reaching the summit, Lantau Peak, where cattle were grazing I had a view of the entire perimeter of Lantau Island including several beaches. Now that the New Airport and bridge to Lantau exists one can make this a road trip by car or bus as well but I would recommend the ferry trip to Silvermine Beach, lunch at one of the local restaurants and hike up to Lantau Peak. Hike farther down to the the north south Tung Chung Road and find a bus that will take you back to Hong Kong Island."

Actually my ultimate motive to visit this island was for the all transparent cable car....but of course as Buddhists we felt that it was necessary to visit the statue of Buddha to pray for some good luck and protection whilst being in a foreign land ourselves without family. It has also been more than 10 years since i last visited it, so it would be a whole new experience for myself. (: Love the air, love the look of the town, love the flora and faunas there! Climbed up the Buddha stairs to get a better view and have a nearer place to do our praying, as well as a challenge for us who hardly exercises XD Good to experience!"

When going places I do not like to come as I go and another thing to learn in Hong Kong is if going to outlying islands by ferry is always go early.Populated islands workers coming and going early and late in day means more frequency of ferries.Go after 8am 8.30am and risk waiting nours.So I recommend this trip for Lantau.Between 7am to *am take one of half hourly ferries to Lantau and get off at Silvermine Bay.Walk to waterfall through village but before check departure time off bus to Tai O fishing village on stilts.Cacth bus after walk to Tai O and check there also time of departure of bus to Ngong Pong or Giant Buddah (Bug Bud).Catch bus up and then cable car down when fiinished to Tung Chung? and its MTR.Maybe stop off at visitor centre on bridge on way back to HK but think no time.Shopping centre at Tung Chung too and close to airport.Maybe last day evening flight check in bags early at Central for plane and do this trip.A walk I have yet to do goes from Tung Chung down coast to Tai O it is in HK Tourist Board Hiking Guide.Takes 6 hrs 16km?So if going to Big Bud on Lantau try doing this route for completeness"

We usually organise things independently and were not really looking forward to being part of a large tour group. However, much to our surprise, we were the only ones who had booked Lantau that day so we had a personalised tour instead. Our tour guide was excellent. He had a huge knowledge of both the Island where he had lived for 13 years as well as a good knowledge of Hong Kong history etc. our tour van was allowed to park up the road so we didn't have to walk up the steps to the Buddah, just a few instead. The area was shrouded in mist which added to the magical feel. The visit to the temples was great as well and gave us an insight into Buddhism. The highlight was probably visiting the fishing villages where people live in these flimsy houses on stilts. By the time we returned to Kowloon via catamaran and ferry, we had had a worthwhile six hour tour and seen a lot more than if we had tried to do the trip as individuals. For those with limited time, a definite must do."

It was very walk-able with no specialist equipment and the views along the way were spectacular. Although it is relatively long and remember you have to get down again so take water with you. On the day we went up there was mist around so it was very surreal to climb up through the mist layer and survey from the top the surrounding peaks. Definitely worth the time and effort if you are feeling like some physical exercise after the Buddha."

Back in the 1990, as a resident of Discovery Bay, I trekked up the highest point in the Lantau Island and was rewarded with beautiful views of the forested areas, long sandy beaches, fishing villages and other calming features of the largest Hong Kong island. On a recent trip, made by taxi from Tung Chung metro station, I saw several changes in the landscape. Chek Lap Kok is fully operational now. There is considerable property development. The Big Buddha and Po Lin monastery have now become a popular tourist destination. Just before the Ngong Ping piazza, the square one crosses before the spiritual attractions, today there are several little touristy stops including souvenir shops, a Hong Kong movie set and a large Oscar statue. Lantau Island\u2019s other attractions include the cabble-car rides over the mountains, wooded areas and water, and of course, the Disneyland resort. A visit to Lantau is highly recommended - both for kids and adults."

Take the subway directly to Lantau - cost about 24HK. Easy ride - not too many people. This is pretty much one stop away from the Airport. Disney is one stop before - most of the families got off at Disney stop. Once you get out of the subway - walk about 5 minutes to the gondolas! There is a huge outlet mall at the subway station - typical North American outlet mall - all the designers. The line ups for the gondola was not too bad - about 15 min and we got there about 10am. The line moves fast. The trip up is about 20 mins - 5.5 KM.. on a clear day very cool with beautiful sights of the mountains and of course the airport & ocean. Once you get to the end - there is a small little touristing gathering of store - we looked at a few - prices were pretty good and you are able to bargain. Make your way past the stores to the steps of the big buddha.. long way up but amazing when you get there. If you walk a few minutes past the stair you will get to the monastery.. It was recently renovated.. Very cool.. great photos with amazing buddhas inside - especially the main area. Had a great time and just before the rush of tourist! You can also take a bus from the subway station but spend the money the gondola is pretty cool."

And if you like a better view take one of the cabins with a glass floor (at cost). You will finally arrive at the \"village\" where it is possible possible to buy just about everything one could want as souvenir. Many shops have been added over the years but the village still keeps its friendly apperance.From there, it's a short walk to the centre place where you can choose to go to Big Buddha on the right, or continue straight to the temple rich in color and so profoundly soothing.Limited food choice is available around the temple but it is vegetarian only. Food vouchers can also be bought just before climbing the steps to the Big Buddha.One of the best way to enjoy your trip to Lantau is to start early using the cable car (one way only) and take the mini bus to return stopping at the fishing village for a late meal.Either way, Lantau Island is well worth a visit. Preferably, choose a day with good weather that will give you a clear and un-interrompted view of the bay and of Hong Kong."

The island is hilly and full of trees. Every once in a while you can see the water peeking at you from behind the trees. Lantau is amazing. I was told there was a bus that would take you to a fishing village at the most western part of the island to watch the sunset. There is also a big Buddha on the island.

On my last day in Hong Kong i visited this Island.It has all one might want: restaurant's, views, hikes, the big Buddha...due to time restraints I only had time for Tai O and the Big Buddha. Things that could help you plan your visit:1. During weekends (have no idea how it is during weekdays) the line to buy tickets to the cable cars and the line to the cable themselves are HUGE. Save time by buying the ticket online in advance. Here is the link to the site where you can buy the ticket. http://www.np360.com.hk/en/booking/np360-tickets-buy.html2. Pay those additional 30-40 HK dollars and upgrade yourself to the crystal cabin with a transparent floor. It is AMAZING!!! (if you have fear of heights then this is definitely not for you. On the other hand, if you have the fear of heights you will not be taking a cable car, right?)The cable car in general is a great experience. It is very long. (takes approximately 30 minute to go each way )3. If the line to the cable car is too big, consider going there by a taxi or a bus and take the cable car on your way down. It seemed to me that the line to go back is way shorter (especially if you take the crystal care- there are two lines and the one to the crystal cable cars is much shorter)4. If you like hiking- the island has several great hikes. One lovely hike starts if you pass by the wisdom path and continue straight. It takes you up the mountain with stunning views. I stumbled upon this track by a mistake and have no idea how it is called. Near the path of wisdom you have big gates, go through them and continue straight and you will be there. 5. Tai O is a popular destination. However i recommend it only if you have spare time. In general, it is a market with shaky houses above water. I didn't find anything particularly fascinating about this place. If you do go there, take a boat ride to see the dolphins. You might not see the dolphins, but you will enjoy the ride and the view of the island. 5. If after visiting the big Buddha you want to go to Tai O ( the fishermen village) and you have a limited time (and the line to the bus is huge), consider taking a taxi from the big Buddha to Tai O ( or the other way around - depends on your itinerary). It costed me 50 HK dollars and saved the time of standing in the line waiting for the bus.The ride takes aproximately 20 minutes by texi6. If you decided to go straight to Tai O from Ngong Ping village (Instead of going first to the big Buddha) the bus ride takes approximately 50 minutes. I started my Lantau island visit by going to Tai O first. It was friday and Easter holidays. The line to the bus was extremely long and it took me 1.5 (!!!) hours to get to the bus. (The line to the cable cars that take you to the big Buddha were a bit shorter that day :) ). So check the two lines first and decide where to start your day (at Big Buddha or at Tai O). The lines from Tai O to the Big Buddha, and from the Big BUddha to Tai O are not that long so consider changing plans according to the length of the lines. 7. The cable cars close at 18:00. 8. The island is close to the airport ( took me 10 minutes by taxi) so consider taking your luggage with you and leave it in the cable care (360 ) luggage storage. It costs 80 HK dollars per suitcase. I first tried to leave my luggage in the mall near by (the outlets) but it was all occupied. If you don't have time going there and back with suitcases (which is also no fun) go for the cable car storage. The prices: In the outlets mall - for the first 5 - 20 HK dollars for each two hours for each cell. Then the price changes. In the cable car storage- 80 HK dollars for the entire day (until 18:00) for one suitcase. I wish i had more time to explore the island!Enjoy!"

There are 2 difference ticket prices - the \"standard\" gondola or the \"crystal\" gondola. The latter has as crystal floor which you can see through hence it's more expensive - screw that, it's not worth the extra cost. Take the standard one which you can see the nice and better view through the window.After arriving at the top you will go through the Ngong Pi market street that leads to the big buddha statue.

Firstly, after collection from the hotel, a ferry ride to Lantau Island, then a coach ride to a lovely local beach (and toilets), then onto a fishing village with a very short boat ride to view the houses on stilts followed by a further drive to the largest outdoor seated Buddha and lunch at the local Monastery that although vegetarian, was surprisingly good. For me the best bit came last - a ride on the nearly new 2.4km cable car from the Monastery (normal price for a single trip of \u00a311.50) over the mountain, past Hong Kong airport and over the inlet to Tung Chung on the northern side of Lantau then a crack ride back to Kowloon and our Hotel. A good day out."

Initially planned to make the most of the tour of Lantau Island, including a ride on the Crystal Cable Car, a visit to the Po Lin Monastery and Tian Tan Budda Statue, a tour of the Tai O village and, finally, a splash on one of the Lantau beaches. However- as all best laid plans are- it went wrong due to the delay at the Tung Chung Terminal, where we had to queue for almost 2 hours.Later, when we arrived on Lantau everything went absolutely perfect: we visited the Big Budda, had lunch in Ngong Ping Village, caught the last bus to the Tai O fishing village and were just in time to book the last boat ride. The main idea of the ride was an encounter with pink(or white) dolphins; although our guide told us it's too late for the dolphins to appear we were lucky to get a glimpse of them splashing quite close to the boat. There were 2 or 3 of dolphins, jumping out of the water on both sides of the boat and it was impossible to predict where they appear next ; watching them was such a pleasure, it was definitely the highlight of the Lantau Tour."

We then purchased handmade teak chopsticks as gifts and they were big hits back home. We then went to the Po Lin Monastery where we had a fantastic and very filling vegetarian lunch- one of the best in Hong Kong, we thought.

The Ngong Ping Monastery, which hosts the Big Buddha, is a hug complex which swallowed up the numbers and was well worth the visit. We chose to continue by bus to Tao O, and again there were other tourists but nothing too hectic and the village was traditional and peaceful.Unfortunately the 'skytrain' was closed for maintenance the day we were there, but we still had a full day out using the MTR and the bus system on the island."

Since the airport is pretty close by, people would actually replace their bore transit time (if they have quite a few hours (5-6 hours) to kill) in the airport and take a mini trip down to visit this renowned touristy site.The 34- metres tall bronze statue faces the North, overlooking the sprawling land of Chinese people. This majestic statue is one of Hong Kong's most famous tourist hotspot. People from land near and far, the East and the West, would come to this place and immerse in the most galvanising cultural experience of a lifetime.For a detailed article with LOADS OF PICTURES on Lantau Island, The Big Buddha, and awesome walking trails to take, visit: http://travelwhenever.com/treks-lantau-peak-hong-kong/"

From there take the cable car to Ngong Ping village. The cable car ride is absolutely breathtaking and it's worth the trip just for this ride. If you're scared of heights, you might want to look at alternatives though, but fantastic views of the airport and the harbour and just a wonderful all round ride. You won't know which way to point your camera. At the other end of the cable car you have to walk through Ngong Ping Village to get to the monastery and Big Buddha. They are very much worth looking at, even if you don't want to climb all the stairs to the Buddha. The village howver is just a commercial strip of shops and there is nothing historical about them at all. Quite tawdry in fact, but you can get drinks or a meal there. Once you've seen the monastery, catch a taxi to Tai O village. If there are a few of you a taxi is by far the cheapest option. Once at the village, its a wonderful walk through the traditional little fishing village. Once you've seen the village do the whole thing in reverse to head back into HK. This all makes a great day out."

The experience of riding this cable is unmatched. As the cable car leaves from the Tung Chung terminal, you will be transported to a different world completely. Within a few seconds, the entire HK International Airport becomes visible in a single glance. In the next few seconds, you find atleast thirty cable cars like your hanging behing you on the same rope. Soon you reach the top of the summit, only to see the next even steeper section of the cable ride ahead of you!! This part of the ride takes you deeper into the Lantao islands, and higher with each passign seconds. A stage comes, when strong lateral winds start swaying the heavy car , and this wind flows continously. As if this was not enough, the thirst section of the cable car, takes you almost to a point which is so high that is not visible at all behind the clouds , and for a moment when you see cable cars ahead of you entering and disappareing the clounds one by one , you are bound to say a prayer or two!!.Finally after 25 minutes of this fantastic journey , we reach the Ngong Ping village which houses the giant Buddha bronze statue which is a marvel in itself. The entire place is very scenic and on a sunny day it is the perfect outing. Man-sized candles being offered to the Gods can be seen.Then there is the Tai O Fishing village which can be reached by bus. Boating at Tai O is just ordinary.

I wished I would have spend more time on the island rather than Honk Kong itself. Will defiantly make a point of staying a couple of days when stopping over in Hong Kong again. Also good bus connection or you can negotiate a taxi fare if time is short. The airport is on the same island. There is als a ferry service from Central Hong Kong."

Starting point of cable car is in vicinity of metro station. But unfortunately because of Chinese new year holidays & also being a Saturday there was a loooong unending queue for cable car. But later after some time some employees of cable car were circulating some brochures about express pass to cable car. The rate was more than double the normal fair but we opt to choose it because we just didn't want to waste our time standing in queue whole day!That was really express pass..worth. so without wasting time in queue we went for cable car & the ride was worth.. spectacular views!!!Island has good options of restaurant, souvenir shops, entertainment shows & big buddha statute.So the place is good but consider the time (as the whole tour needs at least half day) & also the holidays cause of long queue!"

Used the Hong Kong metro system (very efficient, clean, spacious, easy and cheap) to get to Lantau Island where we had hoped to catch the cable car up to the Giant Buddha. Unfortunately we picked one of the two days that it was closed for maintenance checks so had to catch one of the buses. Worth the half hour ride though to visit this peaceful and spiritual place and we also got to see quite a bit of the island along the way. The climb to the top of the Buddha is not for the faint hearted. I've no idea how many steps there are but it felt like a million!! On the plus side, you get to work up an appetite for the snack or meal that's included in the cost of the ticket and which is served within the grounds of the Monastery at the foot of the steps to the Buddha. When you reach the top there are more bronze statues along with small exhibition rooms, 2 tiny souvenir kiosks and amazing views from this magnificent landmark. Enjoyed the tasty hot noodles and spring rolls whilst sitting next to giant incense sticks burning and listening to the Monks chanting their prayers - very soothing. Well worth a visit and by arranging the trip ourselves my sister and I saved over \u00a3100"

One way is US$15, if you choose the crystal floor which you feel like sitting in the air, it is US$23. Queue can be long, better don't go in Hong Kong holidays. They also close at 6pm.If you choose to go by cable car, it take you to the big Buddha and you can have vegetable lunch at the temple and take bus to go to Tai O. Do check the time table at the bus stop, the ride is 20 minutes. If you have time in Tai O, go to the Cafe at the sea front across the bridge. Once you crossed the bridge, it is the wet market, turn right and walk straight down to the street. The Cafe is next to the tofu shop. The Cafe has a balcony built on the sea and has a spectacular view of the hill and you see the wooden houses built on both sides of the shore. If you go in the morning, you can take the bus to Mui Wo, ask the driver to drop you at Lower Cheung Sha beach. As it is far away from the city, the beach is not crowded even during summer time. There are also restaurants at the beach.You can take the bus to Mui Wo to take the ferry back to Central. The ride is 25 minutes.Pick a sunny day and go."

Once you arrive at Tung Chung station it is well signed and an easy walk to the Cable Cars. By the way, you go passed an outlet centre with shops such as Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Timberland and many more. We boarded a crystal gondala but there isn't really any need especially if you are using the gondalas up and down. We thought perhaps the queues would be quicker but they weren't. For every one crystal gondala there were 2 others. The views up were quite spectacular. You could look down and see the walking tracks to the top of the mountain and then eventually you saw the big Buddah in the distance. Once at the top there is a little village full of shops and clean toilet facilities so go while you can. Everything is well signed and the 268 steps weren't that bad! We wandered down the track to the Wisdom Sticks. There are quite a few walks and treks available. We then went back to the Village and caught the local bus to the fishing village. Once again, Octopus Card is accepted on this bus. It was a pleasant trip down. On arrival at the Village there are hawkers for passengers for the boat trips. We caught one that takes you past the houses on stilts then out to sea to see the white dolphins. And you do get to see the dolphins. A worthwhile boat trip. The Village is a fishing village so many, many shops with dried fish and other dried seafood. A bit smelly of course. An interesting little place. We spent an hour there which included the 20 minute boat trip. We then caught the bus back to the top of the mountain to catch our return gondala back however you could catch the gondala up and then a bus to the Village then another bus to Tung Chung or vise versa. We packed our own food for the day but there is pizza, Subway and other food outlets at the top. It is a good day out."

The cable car gives you a great view of the airport (which I thought was pretty cool) and is just a lovely ride. The crystal cable car (glass bottomed) is not worth it. You're not looking out of the bottom anyway and everybody seemed to want to go on the crystal bottomed cars. That coupled with the fact that there are two normal cars to every crystal one meant that we had to line up for about 40 minutes while the normal car people just about walked on. But if you must take the crystal cable car take it one way and do it on the way back. A lot of people took that option but took the crystal car on the way up so the normal car line a lot longer at the other end. I got the snack voucher at the Big Buddha which allows you access into the Buddha. Not that much to see inside but the snack was worth it. More meal sized then snack sized. The meal voucher is expensive and I don't think is worth it. You can buy it up the top so I would wait until then rather than purchasing it at the base of the steps. I got it mainly for the access to the higher level viewing platforms but if that is the only reason you are getting it don't bother as people were just going up the exit stairs. There is so much more to do on Lantau Island though. Put a day aside. It's worth it"

The 1-day trip was a refreshing change in scenery from Hong Kong Island with its mountain view and cooler weather. My parents even think that the island is the highlight of our Hong Kong trip as it's naturally calmer there. Lots to explore for the spiritual and common tourists alike.Besides, you can always stop by at the Citygate Outlet Mall before/after the Ngong Ping 360 ride to Lantau Island for some discount outlets shopping. Tip: We had our Peak tram passes with us and hence, were entitled for a 10% discount on the Ngong Ping 360. We were fine in the Standard cabin although kids may appreciate the Crystal cabin more. Alternatively, if your trip to Victoria Peak is scheduled for later, you may keep your Ngong Ping 360 tickets for a 10% for your Peak tram ride. Then again, the queue for tickets was really long and I would recommend to get the tickets online instead, if it reduces queuing time. Despite so, the trip was worth it but be sure to get an early start."

Eg. they take your photographs on each side of the trolley ride and by the time you reach on the other side, they have souveniers ready with those photographs. We did buy those. There are people standing on the other side, matching your photos to the souveniers. They are little snowglobes, keychains and 3D photo-frames :) Amazing food, lots of things to do.

There were quite a number of other tourists there so we had about a 15 minute wait. The cable car ride provided lovely views of the bay and country side. The small village at the top is basically tourist orientated. Food and beverages are available and of course your usual gift shops. The walk up to the Big Buddha is via stairs. They are slightly steep but you can rest half way up. They are quite manageable. It is well worth the walk as the views are spectacular.

Highly recommend the sky train, but if you are afraid of heights you might want to reconsider!At Lantau Island there are lots of shops for buying trinkets, anything from clothing to souvenirs. Also lots of food shops, coffee and tea shops and ice cream as well. When you are ready to make the hike up the 268 stairs to see the Big Buddha just make sure you bring some water with you. Take a break part way up if you need to, the view from the top is truly inspirational. There is a pathway from the village shops to the steps to the Buddha and you might find friendly cows wandering around. They live nearby and graze close to the Buddha's base. If you do not want to take the cable cars to Lantau Island there is also a bus that drives up, or you can do the cable car one way and the bus back to Hong Kong.Enjoy!"

A widely used prepaid card which you could top up in MTR stations, 7 elevens and many stores which accepted the card. Very useful, saved us from carrying coins! Must get one if you use their public transports!Took a train from Sha Tin Station (Direction Hung Hom Station); took underground from the station to Nam Cheong Station ; from Nam Cheong Station took the Tung Chung Line (Direction Tung Chung)We booked our tickets, Crystal Cabin through the official cable car site http://www.np360.com.hk/ So Glad we chose the tix for the Crystal Cabin!!!! We still had to queue but it was a lot shorter compared to the standard tix! It wasn't even during the weekend but there was a massive queue!I absolutely loved the cable car ride and views on our way up! Quite a distance for the ride! It was fun and thrilling- see the views beneath our feet! Scary!Once we were up the peak, we visited the Ngong Ping Village and shops see photos. We had a walked around and checked out various gifts shops. Took loads of photos of the Big Buddha and also visited and had our late lunch at the restaurant. We were their last customers and they had to turn people away after us. We were starving so any food would have been a bonus even for all non vegetarians! We were instantly converted for the day! Would definitely recommend the trip if you love culture and heritage.Make sure to check for their opening time before you plan to have lunch up there. Avoid weekends or holidays.Get tix for Crystal Cabin, more fun."

Get there at opening time as you wont have to waste precious holiday time queuing! We had the perfect day. The weather was perfection and the views were spectacular! You can pay extra for a glass floor cart which we did only one way my advice. Get it as a return, sun is in a better place after u spend 3 4 hours at the island than it is at 9am. Also everyone wants a see through on the way forward so the queue for that is then longer ;). You can pay \u00a33.50 to go inside Buddah and up for a view a little higher. Not a bad price right? Also includes ice cream and a bottle of water! Why not hey!!? Have a great time just keep an eye on that weather! Download the Hong kong observatory app it really helped me shuffle my holiday in accordance to a day where i needed good wether and when i didnt!"

Instead we went to the Big Buddha by glass bottom cable car, wandered through the little village, visited the monastery and climbed 250 steps to the base of the Buddha. The hall with 10,000 Buddhas was stunning. The vegetarian meal was adequate but could have used more seasoning. The receipt got you inside the Big Buddha. Great views from up there. You can return by cable car, but we chose to take the shuttle to the fishing village and then another public bus to the town where we picked up the ferry to Hong Kong. I personally didn't find the fishing village worth the effort. I would have been just as happy to go straight to the ferry. The scenery on Lantau is quite nice and diverse from being on Hong Kong. I found it interesting to have a Starbucks and Subway at the monastery village."

There is a lot to do in the island... the most exclusive is the tour to giant bronze Buddha via a breathtaking cable car ride up a mountainside, Ngong Ping Village, the famous Po Lin Monastery, the historical fishing village of Tai O where Tanka boat people still live in stilt houses. There is so much to do so I will suggest you start early when you visit the island... TIP - take the CRYSTAL Cabin cable ride... it is a bit expensive.. but totally worth it."

Around 12.30 having missed the bus we caught a taxi to Tai Po and had lunch and a good explore, we then caught a bus to Mui Wo which took about 45 minutes and then caught the ferry back to Central and came into the harbour as the sun set and the lights came on.

Upon arrival we queued up for cable ride to the Ngong Ping village. Unfortunately everywhere you go in HK, crowdiness is unavoidable. Of course the queue would have taken hours but we decided to pay for tour package upgrade which means putting us on priority line and jumping queue. We got on the cable car immediately and landed at the village after 30 minutes ride in the cable car. Nice view from the top but can be frightening too due to lengthy period stucked in confined area. The village proves to be another mini mall with souvenier shops and restaurants scattered. As part of the tour package, we visited a historical fishing village Tai O, boat ride around the bay etc. I would have loved to stay at the fishing village a bit longer to taste the local food but unfortunately we had to board the bus to move on to our next destination. Overall quite good tour package but too rush. Money well spent for priority line catching the return cable ride back though. Otherwise would have been stucked since the last return cable ride was at 6.30pm. Long queue as usual."

I had not researched the cable car thoroughly and this took me by surprise by how long it went for and how high you actually are.

On the other hand, its kind of fascinating to see them constructing a 30km bridge.) There isn't much in the way of food or drink so you'll have to bring your own."

Upon arrival, you take a 30 minute cable cart to the Big Buddha, but the view is wonderful - you see the mountains of Hong Kong and the harbour. And that is just the beginning - the Big Buddha lives up to its name!! One of the most beautiful statues ever made with amazing 360 views around it. You can also do prayers which I would highly recommend. The only thing that I found unappealing is how commercialized the small town is before entering the Big Buddha (too many souvenir shops with items that aren't related to Buddhism)."

We took the ferry from Pier 6 towards Mui Wo at the Central Ferry Pier. The ferry took 50 minutes. Once we arrived at the island, we could see buses lined up to go to different places. We took Bus 1 to Tai O. When we arrived at Tai O, we visited the silt houses. We could see the fishermen houses on silts. The locals were also hanging salted fishes to dry. This place reminds me of Pulau Ketam. Then we decided to go to visit the Giant Buddha at Ngong Ping. It is the biggest sitting Buddha. We walked up the steps and the scenery is breath taking. This place is really different from the city, all peace and quiet. It gives you the calmness. If compare to the giant Buddha I visited Wuxi last year, it is really different. Then we walked to the Ngong Ping village which is filled with shops and fun activities. The place is pretty hyped. Then we took the cable car down. The view is pretty awesome and we could see the whole airport from our cable car. Watch out for discounts with credit cards as I had mine with HSBC. They also take photos for you when you get on the cable car and you may purchase the photo for HKD100 as a souvenir."

And you can use the MTR via Tung Chung from Jordan or TST in Kowloon very easily to get to the cable car station."

We also had a great Vegetarian Lunch that was included in the tour at the Monastery that gave the taste of the cuisine of Buddists in Ngong Ping Village.Did some shopping too.The we moved on to the Cable car that would take down the hill with breathtaking views of the Ocean, Hills and the Airport. This is so good, that you've to just experience it to feel it.We arrived down the hill and the bus was waiting for us to take back to the Airport.We reached the airport at about 3:30 and had plenty of time for the connecting flight.Overall it was a great short tour that was memorable and the arrangement from Splendid tours was just great and it couldn't be any better.The cost was about $100 USD per person and it's worth it.I'd recommend this, and would certainly take another tour from Splendid if I travel through Hong Kong again."

We took part in a full day tour with Splendid Tours (booked through Viator) to have a better look at Lantau Island (where the new airport is based). The company picks people up from their hotel and takes them first to a view point of the fantastic new bridges built to link Lantau Island with Hong Kong's mainland and then onto the Island itself. A local bus company and guide take over from there and our trip took us first to a lovely sandy beach (of course in December somewhat deserted) and to an old fishing village with many houses built on stilts right over the water. From the village we drove up to the Giant Buddha and the Temple of the Thousand Buddhas right up on the hill tops, where we had time to look at the temples, the Buddha and also took part in a vegetarian lunch in the Monastry cafe. The last stage was by cable way from the Monastery down to the sea level, i.e. the place where we swapped buses in the morning, then with a splendid tour bus back to our hotel. It was a great day out and we learned so much about life outside the busy busy Hong Kong city area, the way the Islanders used to live and the history of the monastery and the Giant Buddha. Highlights included the bridges view point, the size of the Giant Buddha and the temple of the Thousand Buddhas - you have to see it to believe it. But more than anything else, we enjoyed and valued the excellent commentary of our local guide Ben; his considered Information (not too much - but all of it highly relevant - and its delivery (passionate, insightful, positive) were the absolute highlight of the trip. One bit of advice: If the weather looks changeable take an extra layer of clothing with you. It is much colder on the hilltops than at sea level and the cabins of the cable way are extremely 'well' aired."

You can see some of them from the cable car. The airport is just off the island on another island that was leveled for the airport. I didn't notice noise from the planes - maybe because it was windy. The area at the top, near the cable car drop off, is a tourist trap. If you need a coffee, then Starbucks is there for you. The giant Buddha is another long hike up some stairs. It is worth it. Incredible views. There is a monastery and some Buddhist temples - they look fairly new and are quite large. There are some feral cows roaming around - they aren't the Texas size cows. They quite small for cows. They seem used to all the people. If you have time, walking around the trails would be nice. We only stayed until about 1pm and then left.

Here's how to do it:* Take MTR (subway) from Hong Kong Island (that's where I stayed) to Tung Chung station* Walk a couple minutes to the Ngong Ping 360 cable car station (Starbucks nearby) and enjoy a 25-minute soaring ride with spectacular views (standard car 115 HKD/$15 USD one-way) to Ngong Ping Village. Ngong Ping Village is very Disney-like (hey, they are close to Disney!) but has all the things that tourists need and appreciate - clean dining, clean free restrooms (with paper!), shopping and bus/taxis.* Walk over to see Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery - easy walk, climb the 260 steps to the Buddha. At both sights you will see many locals offering prayers and gifts (oranges, money) to the buddha and burning LOTS of incense. Both of these attractions are free.* We then took bus #21 to Tai O fishing village, about 12 minutes away. The bus runs every 20-30 minutes or so, so check the schedule. Very cheap - 6.60 HKD / <$1 USD. Nice coach bus. Tai O was my absolute fave part of this excursion because it is the real, rural China. You will feel as though you are in a completely different country than Hong Kong. This is a totally different lifestyle and people are very hard-working, simple and humble. They live in a very small community of stilt houses that teeter on wood 2x4s and it is amazing how they remain standing. There is a market of live and dried seafood products and their specialty is shrimp paste. You will see villagers making certain tasty treats so buy some, support them and enjoy!! My favorites - egg waffles (regular or chocolate)- 15 HKD/<$2 USD and a homemade donut, kind of like a beignet, hot and rolled in sugar - hot, slightly crispy and soooo delicious (8 HKD)! As we walked around, people go about their daily life - hanging laundry to dry, playing a dice game and just sitting with friends/family. Please respect these people and do not take their photo unless they approve. I wonder if (and hope that) this village and culture remains decades from now. It is something that you will rarely see!* We then went to Mui Wo to catch the ferry. Bus #1 (50 minutes, 8 or 10.70 HKD depending if the bus has a/c). We missed the bus and since there were 6 of us, we took 2 taxis instead at cost of 165 HKD per car (30 minute trip, so saves time) - very reasonable with multiple people in the car. Mui Wo looks like a cute little town with a beach so you could spend a couple hours here.* Ferry from Mui Wo to Hong Kong Central - 2 options: fast boat (30 minutes, 28 HKD/$4 USD) or slow boat (60 minutes, 14 HKD/$2 USD). Nice, scenic trip across the harbour.Awesome day! If you are a hiker, there are lots of trails on the island to enjoy and we saw many hikers. This was all very easy to navigate and plenty of people speak English if you need assistance. Enjoy!"

We then caught the no. 2 bus which took us on a very scenic ride round part of the island to Ngong Ping, We saw some fantastic scenery climbing into the mountains. At Ngong Ping there is the Po Lin monastery, and the big Buddha. Unfortunately it was raining quite heavily so we didn't spend as much time as planned walking around. The area was stunning. We then walked through the tourist village with all its shops and restaurants. We caught the cable car to Tung Chung. The cable car ride was amazing, such a shame it was raining but the scenery was fantastic, a great ride so much to see. From Tung Chung we then caught the MTR back to Kowloon. We really enjoyed the day and the island and would love to return and do the trip again. We got so much information from the brilliant website, Hong Kong extras."

I have been travelling to Hong Kong for many years now and I finally got to visit Lantau Island.Caught the ferry from Central to Lantau Island - Mui Wo . This was my first stop and I strolled around the beach area for around 30 minutes to take in scenery. From here I took the local bus which can be found in front of the ferry terminal and headed to Tai O .The bus only takes 40 - 45 mins but once you arrive at Tai O there is plenty to explore.A fascinating place to visit, take in the many sights like the the old homes which have been on stilts.Taking a water tour is a good way to see the homes . Also suggest that you walk to the Heritage Hotel ( a former police station which has been restored to a lovely hotel) . From Tai O I took a local taxi which was only a 20 minute ride to Ngong Ping ( there is also a bus service available ) , to the site of the Buddha statue.The walk up the many steps is well worth it , the view from the top is amazing. From Ngong Ping one can either get the cable car or catch a bus to head to Tung Chung - train station plus a good size shopping centre. From Tung Chung you can catch a train and head back to TST or Hong Kong Island.A good day out with plenty to see and do."

The Buddha is however only very new so it is not an ancient monument but still quite stunning in itself.Although the site is fairly well commercialised the shops are not the top designer shops you see everywhere else in Hong Kong. The site still seems to retain an air of tranquility. Like much in Hong Kong these days the vista is spoilt by the smog that comes in from China.Whilst we didn't do any of the walks we saw from the cable car many folks enjoying the rugged forested slopes that surround the site. Its quite strange one minute you are in one of the most heavily populated places on earth and 5 minutes later you can be totally isolated."

Once on the island the main attraction is the Big Buddha/Po Lin Monastery in the centre of the island at Ngong Ping accessible either by bus or using the Ngong Ping 360 cable car. At the Buddha/monastery you can get a ticket that includes a vegetarian meal at the monastery which is tasty and filling. The trip on the Ngong Ping cable car provides spectacular views but takes about 20 minutes each way so can be a little unnerving for some.Also on the island visit Tai O village if you get a chance, accessible by bus, this small fishing village still has houses built on stilts and only takes about an hour of your time.We took a day to visit the island arriving by ferry to the port at Mui Wo then taking a bus outside the ferry terminal to Tai O for a short visit then a bus to Ngong Ping to see the Big Buddha/monastery and finally taking the cable car back down the mountain and then metro back to Kowloon of Hong Kong island.

You can do some shopping at Citygate Outlet Mall. I don't recommend as it's not that cheap compared to where I come from 2) take cable car ride from station near Citygate to Ngong Ping Village. 40 minutes queue on a weekday and 25 minutes ride. Choose crystal cabin for a glass bottom cabin. 3) visit Big Buddha and adjoining temple. Vegetarian food is available in the temple for a price 4) take bus 21 from ngong ping village to Tai O, a nearby fishing village. Be sure to find out the timing for the bus as the frequency is one per hour. You can use octopus card to pay the fare. Bus ride is about 15 mins. 5) visit tai o. You take hire a boat for a chance to see pink dolphins, if not just walk around and see Hong Kong Ina village setting. Take a walk through the market and continue along the coast. Right at the end you will find a hotel which was converted from a police station. Not sure about the logic why the police station is located at the end of a road and looking out to sea. The hotel is close to public by 6pm. 6) take bus 11 from tai o to mui wo ferry terminal. The frequent is about one per half hour so no worries here. You can use octopus card as well. Ride is about 45minutes, if I did not remember wrongly. 7) from mui wo, take ferry to central pier, located near central mtr station. You can use octopus card as well. Journey is about 2 hours I think.Hope this help."

Take a Crystal Cabin to avoid the queues and get the best views through the see through floor! The cable car ride alone is worth the trip for the terrific views of this beautiful green island. The giant Buddha at the top and a tourist village gives the whole family many options to climb or shop and of course to eat in either western or asian cafes and restaurants.

As the air was murky for the entire period of my visit, I did not bother with Ngong Ping 360. It would hardly have been my first cable car (the Matterhorn is spectacular \u2013 I get the impression that Ngong Ping would have impressed me rather less even if I could have had some clear air). And big Buddhas fashioned for questionable motives (religious, or commercial? . . some writers seem to ruminate over this quandary) have also been spotted on more than one occasion. The other theme park aspects of the hilltop also seem a bit off-putting. I spend time in Buddhist countries, and go to temples for solace and meditation. Not for selfies or other photo ops, nor for adjustments to bucket lists. City Gate mall is touted as an outlet mall. If one has read the assessments of the \u201cindustry\u201d built up around outlet malls, one might wonder about what's inside (and avoid such places). I spent a bit of time there one evening. It wasn't crowded then. The place is clean. However, it didn't present itself to me as good for any shopping, with the possible exception of some foodstuffs on the ground floor. The bus & MTR interchange outside the mall is, however, handy.My wife and son visited HK Disney during its opening week a few trips ago. My wife's summary? Lots of people with bad manners. Poor crowd control compared with Disney Anaheim or even Disney Orlando.Aome of the residential sections are also pleasant looking. Some views from the Tung Chung MTR line, and maybe more so from the roadway and buses, are also nice. The Tung Chung (and thus the Airport Express) line, however, was clearly not designed to optimize views from the train. That's a pity.The countryside looks inviting. The networks of trails beckon for another time, when the air might be cleaner and cooler. If I get to enjoy any of those under favourable conditions on a future trip, I might submit a new, more positive, view."

Officially it is also referred to as Ngong Ping 360 and has a website of its own which has a lot of details. Once you reach the island, you can visit the giant statue of Buddha by climbing around 300 well-built stairs. There is a monastery near by where you can go for lunch or snacks. You can buy the tickets for these from the counters at the base of the staircase that leads to the Buddha statue. Once at the top near the statue, you can see all around the panoramic island. You can also go around the island on different buses if you arrive earlier and see the traditional fishing village etc. There are combo tickets available. You have plenty of food options once you reach the cable car terminal at the other end. If you take the cable car ride, you also get a nice view of the Hong Kong International Airport at a distance and you can see planes taking off or landing. The cable car ride is also very beautiful."

Whether you like to hike and enjoy the beautiful outdoors, sight-seeing or feeling like you stepped back in time 30 years, Lantau island has something for you. The Ngong Ping 360 (crystal cabins are the best) is a great way to start where you can get great views of the water, islands, HKIA (airport), the big buddha and more. Next, you can continue your walk to see the Big Buddha, Grand Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas (newly opened) and Po Lin Monastery. 15min walk from there is Wisdom path and many other trails or a 15min taxi or 25-30min bus ride and you are at Tai O fishing village. Whether you are on a long layover in Hong Kong or visiting for days/weeks, Lantau should be at the top of your list. Opt for a clear day if you are here for more than 1-2 days but even on cloudy days, it is still an amazing place to visit."

So the low rating is not for Lantau Island nor the Big Buddha, but more for our lack of homework on the logistics and planning. If you go on your own, I would recommend an early start."

To get to Tung Chung you have to take MRT (Tung Chung line/Disneyland Resort) from Kowloon Station, Hong Kong Station, Tsing Yi, Lai Keng and Olympic. One trip from Kowloon station to Tung Chung is HKD 18. The journey will take about 30 minutes. Once exiting walk toward the Ngong Ping cable car station. I strongly suggest that you avoid weekends and public holidays (if possible), but if you only be able to visit during weekends or public holidays I strongly suggest that you pre purchased the ticket through it's official website. The queue can take as long as an hour to purchase the ticket (if you purchase the ticket on site). The standard cabin will set you back HKD 150 (return) while the crystal cabin (the floor of the cable car made of glass) will set you back HKD 235 (return). They also offer a bundling package that will start at HKD 250 (depends on the package you want to take). The cable car journey takes about 20 minutes (roughly) from Ngong Ping lower station to Lantau Island. Once you get to the island there is a ngong ping village which consists of shops and restaurants. The main attraction in Lantau Island is the Po Lin Monastery and the sitting Buddha statue. The last cable car to leave Ngong Ping village is at 6.00 pm during weekdays (Mon-Fri), and at 6.30 pm during weekend and public holiday."

I'm not sure what stop it is on the Tai O bus but it looks like a little fishing hub/pier with a long walk way heading out to the coastline. Take that pier walkway out and walk all the way to the end and follow the walkway. Ask some people you cross where the pools are and it's only a 20-25min hike up to them. My friend and I hiked pretty far up past the main 2-3 pools and you can make it all the way to the ridge line if you like. If that's something you want to do I strongly recommend bringing something sturdier than flip flops... There is flagging that shows you the best path up until the last little chunk before the ridge line. I will say that the best pool we found was about 1/2-2/3 the way up to the very top so continue on only if you are really keen on the view point."

The cable car ride of course gives great views over the island, and takes about 20 or 30 minutes.*) We bought the ticket for the cable car, single-ride on the spot itself. Costs 105 HKD for a Standard Cabin. Pick up a map of Ngong Ping Village from the Ticket Office. Cable Car ride provides amazing views and is a must-do.*) The cable car drops you at the station on the other side, from there its a small walk to Po Lin Monastery and to the foot of Big Buddha, through the village, which is more like a road with lots of restaurants and shops etc. On the way while going you will see Public Transport Interchange on your right side, from here you can take the return bus Lantau Bus No 23 back to Tung Chung MTR instead of Cable Car. The bus drives through steep hill and takes around double the time of Cable Car approx 45 mins. Try to sit on the upper deck of the bus, gives better views.*) Toilets are available in the village road.*) There is a Subway (Shop No: 9B), Starbucks Coffee (Shop No: 10) and Seven-Eleven as well, both at the cable car station, outside MTR, as well as in the village road.*) Did not see Indian food options, but Vegetarian options are available in the Po Lin Monastery itself. While visiting the Po Lin Monastery don't miss the chance to dine on some authentic Buddhist Vegetarian food either at the dining hall or the deli/snack-shop. All foods here conform to Buddhist Vegetarian principles and contains only vegetables, bean products and oysters. Outside at the deli/snack-shop similar vegetarian delights can be bought to take away, or to eat at the outdoor tables. Focusing more on snacks size items there are daily freshly made bean curd deserts and most famously the mango filled rice dumplings. The dining hall is open from 11:30 to 4:30pm and is to the left of the main Shrine. *) Did not see Drinking water fountains, so best to bring your own water.For a detailed trip list feel free to visit http://hongkongandmacauitinerary.blogspot.in/2014/10/hong-kong-macau-itinerary.html"

First recommendation, if you plan on taking the cable car, purchase your ticket in advance so that when you get there you can get it the line for those already with tickets. When we arrived (around 10:30 am) we followed the signs from the train station and thought it looked like a short line, but it snaked around and then once you finally made it to the ticket booth, there was another snaked line hidden from view behind the ticket booth. We ended up waiting in line for over an hour. The view was really great though once we were on the car.We would recommend taking the bus up and the cable car back but we did not take the bus so that may also be a long wait.Upon arrival, it felt like the Asian version of Florida's \"Holy Land\" theme park. Lot's of opportunities to buy stuff, \"walking with Buddha\" movie, etc. The good part is that there is an actual monastery, Po Lin. It was nice and it is a good idea to be quiet and respectful as visitors worship. The steps to the Buddha are pretty steep if you are not in good shape. The Buddha itself is a little difficult to photograph (kind of like being next to the statue of liberty). For Photographic reasons, choose the time of day wisely. We ended up getting there later than we anticipated due to the long lines for the cable car. So roughly around 1:00 PM. The sun was making it so difficult to get a decent photo.Keep a close watch on the ground below and you can see the amazing hiking trail and animals. It is worth going to after you wade through the tourism zone."

We wandered around just taking in the daily life and went on a twenty minute boat ride. It was very interesting seeing the stilt houses, and we were lucky enough to see the pink dolphins. We caught another bus to Tian Tan to see the big buddha and then the cable car ride to an mtr station. Cable car takes about 30 minutes, it is a great way to see the view of Hong Kong. It was a little hazy the day we were there, but well worth it. A great day seeing the sights."

To get up to the top of the mountain to see Big Buddha you would need to pay to get on a cable car I've got height anxiety so didnt take the cable car but good news for any one with height anxiety or phobia is that there are coaches that go up to the top of the mountain as well. Take abit longer than the cable car but ticket is really cheap. When you are up at the top you would be witnessing one of the most beautiful sight that exist in this planet Big Buddha along with the stairs that lead everone to him. The temple at the bottom of Big Buddha has a restaurant which serve vegetarian food which I found delicious. This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen and would recommend anyone going to hongkong not to miss. Also at the bottom of the mountain at the coach station there is a shopping outlet with many great clothing store with decent price also restaurant like Star buck or Mac Donald it will be your great day out."

There are choices of a variety of packages available, if you want to make the most of the experience on the island. Taking a cable car is not only the most quickest way but offers great views of Hong Kong International Airport and the surrounding land and sea . There are plenty of shops in the village selling various souvenirs, so there is something suitable for everyone! There are various shows available to keep everyone entertained. A walk up the many steps to see the Buddha is tiring but well worth the effort where there are spectacular sceneries around. For those who loves a walk, there are guided trails for short walk in the countryside.If you are planning to return to Tung Chung by cable car, remember to buy a return ticket so you can be fast tracked to the front of the queue. When we were leaving the queue was do long and were glad we purchased a return ticket!"

We went on a mini bus to a beach on the south side, into the mountains, to the Tai O fishing village on stilts on the river, the short boat trip, the village market with dried fish and undiscernable other items, then to the top of Ngong Ping where sits the Big Buddha. Because we were in a mini bus we could be driven to the top. Large buses cannot fit and have to stay at the bottom. So we only had to walk down the 265 stairs, not up as well. At the bottom of the stairs, remember to stand in the centre of the circular structure and speak to hear your own echo - natural accousitcs because of the circle. Quite remarkable. The meal at the Monastery (vegan only) was fantastic ! We were unable to go by cable car that day as it was closed for regular maintenance (closed for a whole week every 2 or 3 months) so had to return by mini bus. However, as the cable car (called Ngong Ping 360) was open again a few days later, we returned independently (no tour) and discovered the themed village as well. It was all so very close to the Monastery and the Big Buddha. Well set up for tourists, clean and appealing. Easy to get the MTR train to Tung Chung station from HK. Get the cable car up to the Big Buddha, Monastery, Themed Village and back home same way. If visiting Lantau Island independently (not on a pre paid tour) you can pay at the Cable Car terminal at Tung Chung for optional extras to go to the fishing village and have the Monastery meal if you want. Allow a whole day. Very enjoyable."

A really full day, so start as early as you can manage -although bear in mind that the Ngong Ping 360 doesn't start running till 9 am on week-ends and 10 am on week days. In order to miss the queues to the gondola we decided to start the day at Tai O fishing village. We travelled by train to Tung Chung from Wan Chai (that's about 50 minutes) and stopped at the discount outlet mall for coffee and a cake at Starbucks, as well as stocking up on some Subway for our two young teens who had decided that they didn't really fancy eating exotic authentic Chinese fare at Tai O for lunch and preferred a western style picnic! The number 11 bus to Tai O runs every 15 minutes - it's busy with very orderly queues which see most buses leaving full. The trip to Tai O involves quite a lot of stops for locals and walkers -takes about 50 minutes - lots of steep inclines and twists and turns. On arrival at Tai O you will be greeted by the local sight-seeing boat offering tickets at HKD25 per person. If you pass them by and walk down the little street and to the left over the bridge you'll get the same tour for HKD20 (position counts it seems!) The boat tour involves about ten minutes seeing the stilted houses and businesses, then heading out to sea (not far) for about another ten minutes to (hopefully) spot the pink dolphins - which seems to be a matter of luck. We saw a few leaping in the distance but couldn't get any decent photos, but a friend who was there recently said there was a whole school of them swimming around their boat!The Heritage Hotel on the peninsula to the west of the village dates back to its origins in 1902 as a British police station - we cruised past on the boat but didn't have time to visit. You can get a boat ride from the bus to the hotel for HKD10 or take a leisurely stroll around the shore. It looks like a great spot for afternoon tea or a cool drink on the veranda.The Tai O Village itself is fascinating - a real working fishing village with the most amazing array of dried fish and crustaceans, as well as various shrimp pastes and other exotic ingredients. The displays at each little shop are quite lovely, but the smells are interesting to the western nose! There are numerous little restaurants selling everything from very good looking scallops and grilled prawns and fish to other more suspicious looking local delicacies. We bought several cans of icy cold beer and soft drinks from one of the restaurants and had a great picnic lunch in a square outside a temple, before heading off for the rest of the sights.The number 21 bus takes about 20 minutes to climb up to Ngong Ping Village which is pleasant, but very touristy. There are some nice shops, as well as the to-be-expected concessions, but the souvenirs are at the upper end of the scale. There are others along the walk from the Village to the giant buddha. We wandered along the avenue bordered by the twelve warriors and hence up the many steps (well over 250 I think) to the Big Buddha. Unfortunately the day was hazy but the views were nevertheless spectacular. Well worth the climb up and back.We ran out of time so didn't go to the Po Lin Monastery. The queues to get back down on the Ngong Ping 360 took about20 minutes to wind through the turn styles (this was about 4 pm). You will be much quicker if you pay about 50% more to use the \"crystal gondola\" which has a glass floor. We went on the standard one, and believe me the views are amazing over the very heavily vegetated hills, and then down onto the Hong Kong International Airport. When you go over the switching stations some of the drops are spectacular so a good head for heights is important."

Lantau is where the airport is situated but much of the island is still forested. We took a bus up to Po Lin Monastery and it went through many hills and valleys and along the coast to get there. We saw some pretty spectacular scenery including some very tall waterfalls.The island is well connected with the rest of Hong Kong through the MTR Tung Chung Station. At that station, there is a very large up-scale outlet mall with restaurants, a large grocery and a wine bar. We are going to explore the fishing villages next time."

            "review": "Lantau Island tour. We were collected promptly from our hotel in Kowloon at 08:15 and then driven to Hong Kong Island to meet our rep (Quinde) and catch the ferry to Lantau. The ferry ride took about 30 minutes where we were met by bus and driven to Cheung Sha Beach where we stopped for a comfort break and to take photos. It was okay but nothing much to see and 10 minutes was certainly enough time to spend there. We then carried on to Tai O fishing village where we walked through the Market selling dry fish (be warned not the most pleasant of smells but bearable) and then had a 20 minute boat trip around the harbour observing the old fisherman\u2019s huts on stilts.Then it was on to the main event and we were driven up to the Big Buddha. The drive was very scenic and it is certainly a lovely island with lots of greenery. There were only 7 of us on the tour which made it a nice group and we all got on very well. Our guide Quinde was informative, however her manner left a lot to be desired \u2013 eg. She had no interest in any of us and talked down to us and was very abrupt if we had any questions. She also spent a lot of time telling us about her apartment and how much it was now worth and rest of time was glued to her mobile phone even to the point of ignoring a question from one of the group altogether! We drove right up to the back of the Big Buddha and went and viewed the exhibition hall which was very interesting and then made our way down the steps at the front before going to the Po Lin Monastery for a vegetarian lunch which even though I am not a huge fan of vegetables was very nice. Even though the area was very busy with tourists it never felt crowded and there was plenty of time to walk around.We then got back on the bus for a short trip to the Ngong Ping 360 sky cable car where we had 30 minutes to look round the small shopping mall before going on the cable car. This was a good place to buy souvenirs as a good variety of shops and of a good quality too. Particularly liked the shop that only sold chop sticks. There was also a nice square to sit and a good selection of cafes and ice cream sellers.We were given the option to pay extra for a cable car with a glass bottom but as none of our group were interested in this we just had an ordinary car which you could still get great views from all the way round. Did not really see the point of a glass bottom as you wouldn\u2019t see much else but grass! The cars all seat 8 so we could all travel together and it takes about 25 minutes to descend the mountain. A couple of us were a bit apprehensive as not too keen on heights but it was a very pleasant journey and the views were great. You certainly got an idea of the size of the airport and how busy it was with planes landing and taking off every few seconds and could see all the work that was been done to reclaim more land from the sea. At the bottom we were assaulted with the dreaded obligatory photo that was taken as we boarded and politely declined and we were then transported by coach direct back to our hotels.All in all it was a very good day, Lantau Island is well worth a visit and nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a few hours. Apart from our guide we all had a great time."

Its get slightly chillier at the told of the temple, so those that are not well adverse to the cold, a wind breaker is better suited for the climb. The hike up the hundreds of steps was tempted with a nice vegetable lunch...so up we went....all hundreds of steps.

We chose the glass bottom cable car once we reached there, we walked over to the Giant Buddha. You have to climb 280 over steps up and once you reached to the top, you will be rewarded with a view. We donate a little and we get to enjoy some vegetarian meal with desserts. It's very nice meal.We then walk over to the bus terminus and wait for bus no 21 to Tai-O. A fishing village selling lots of dried seafood. We had some snacks there but was unfortunate that time was not on our side. So we did not managed to take a boat to see the dolphin.

The cable car was good to see all the small islands and the new airport with all the planes taking off. The 'village' at the other end of the cable car is poor and just full of tacky souvenir shops and we bypasses them as quick as possible.We had lunch at the monastery where you get a good value vegetarian set lunch. It's very simple but has its own rustic charm. We visited the Big Buddha which was exactly what it says on the tin!We then took the bus to Tai O traditional village which took about 15/20 min. We really liked this place as the village is in an island and there's lots of stalls selling dried fish which is quite interesting and not too smelly! We took the boat trip around the island and took some good photos of the traditional houses on stilts. The boat trip was a good length circling the island and pointing out all the main features and good value."

The ride last about 25 minutes and the wind that shakes the car was very strong so I felt i might go down at any time. Once up, the area was very touristy and it took little time to try and go down. The line to go down must have had a good 500 people in front by this time and was moving very slow. Also, those who had paid the higher dollar scenic fare were able to proceed ahead of all of us commoners. After about 1 1/2 hours I was nearing the front and they had to shut the cable cars down due to lightning. Buses were slowing coming up and getting people off the mountain. It took another 1 1/2 hours before loading on a bus and making it down a dangerous mountain road. When I left there must have been another 800-1000 people behind me.

We had an 8 hour layover between flights on the way home from Europe and decided to get out and head to Lantau Island via the Cable Cars as we did not get around to doing this when last in HK. After exiting immigration we headed downstairs to the bus area and for HKD3.50 caught the S1 bus out to the terminal where the cable car departs from. A very short bus ride and we were half an hour early which was excellent to start the queuing for the ride over. Opening at 9am it cost HKD150 per person to get over to the island. Once there we found everything still just opening really. Which we did not mind. The place is very touristy but surprisingly loved looking at the shops there, one that caught my eye was the Chopstick shop...could have easily bought a heap of these had I room in hand luggage. Saw the Big Buddha, very impressive and a reasonable climb. The temple had a lot of restoration going on so not much happening there although able to pray and light incense in the grounds. There is a vegetarian restaurant there if hungry. Basically once seen we hoped back on the cable car for the 25 minute stunning ride back to the mainland. So glad we took a stretch out of the airport after a long flight."

The Buddha himself I think very impressive, he is 110 feet tall and weighs 250 tonnes. There are a lot of gift shops and restaurants up there, all worth a look.If you are into shopping, the mall in Tung Chung has lots of designer shops, as well as a lot of other outlets including coffee bars etc and across the walkway is a Chinese market."

We were told by our hotel to arrive by 0900 for the cable car, and then found it did not open until 1000. Right next to the cable car is a large outlet mall, with great stores and good sales, so we saved it for the end of the trip. The lines started at the cable car by 0915, and it took awhile to buy the tickets. We bought the combination of all of them, and it probably was a bit more expensive than doing it per piece, but this was more convenient. The cable car was a nice ride up to the village by the Buddha. It is all nicely laid out, rather touristy, but very clean and well organized. The Buddha is visible on the way up, and well worth the 200 steps up to see up close. The movie prior to the Buddha was a bit disappointing, as we expected to hear the history and learn about the statue itself, and instead it was an animated film about the history of the worship of it, but was still worthwhile. After the Buddha and having a nice lunch (brought our own, but there is a nice veggie restaurant on site), we took a bus to Tao O fishing village. This was great, it gave an idea of how the villagers manage, and we took a boat and saw their homes, and were able to see some of the pink dolphins jumping in the water. From here you can take a ferry back to transportation to Hong Kong, but we went back on the bus to the Buddha, took another ride back on the cable car, and then shopped at the outlets. Then, took the MTR back to Hong Kong, which was about 45 minutes. It was a full and very fun day (about 12 hours total) and we did it on our own time schedule, which we preferred over an organized tour. Highly recommend visiting Lantau!"

There have already been hundreds of reviews of this island here on Trip Advisor, so I really won't be able to offer that much insight into Lantau that will differ from erstwhile postings. For certain, Lantau is worth visiting, for its hilltop-straddling Big Buddha, quaint (yet a little rough around the edges) seaside villages, and surprisingly-mountainous interior scenery are all splendid ways to pass time on a day trip from HK. However, with that said, be prepared for quite a bit of tourist traffic. On my trip there in February, a low season experience--yet on the cusp of CNY (Chinese New Year), I was startled by how many 'mainland' tourists were there, and at one point, my jaw dropped at how long the line was at one seaside village's bus stop. With more and more Chinese tourists traveling nowadays, this will, guaranteed, be the scene globally. Thus, the only suggestion I could make here is to get away from that all! Although I didn't do it myself, and though I haven't done any research into it, I'd recommend renting bicycles or scooters/motorbikes to get into the more rural areas of the island instead of tagging along on a tour group or taking one of the tourists buses from the peer (I'd taken the fast ferry from the Outlying Islands Peer in Central). I'd taken one of the latter, and I must say that the views along the mountainous roads were outstanding, but being trapped on a bus and not being able to explore more was troubling. So if you go, do some research on renting bikes or scooters so you can see more than the average tourist. If I go back, I'll surely take that option to get off the trampled path where everyone else seems to tread. You should do the same!"

This was our favourite day trip. The local tour guide was fantastic, he was very knowledgable and engaging. The afternoon began with a bus ride to Lantau from Kowloon, to the Ngong ping cable car. This had spectacular views, it takes about 25mins using the cable car to reach the big Buddha. We then also could look at the monastery. Our group then continued to tai o fishing village about 15mins by bus. Our guide once again continued with interesting commentary of the village, before taking us on another drive to the first ferry, which we caught back to Hong Kong island. The only suggestion I would make, is it would have been nice to have more time at the Buddha/monastery, rather than more time in the village. But I suppose if you did a longer day tour or went on your own that would be possible. Also, our guide was telling us about pink dolphins off tai o village, but we weren't given the opportunity to take time to view them. This might be a nice thing to add into the tour or try and find a tour that does (keeping in mind we only had a half day tour).Lantau Island itself, is very different to Hong Kong/Kowloon. Extremely scenic, much less populated. It makes a lovely change from the hustle and bustle of the city."

I was on my way at 9am and the cable car line was about 10 min. The views from the cable car are great. I took the crystal floor and in the end I'm not sure it was worth it except for the fact that the lines for the crystal bottom are always shorter (fewer people pay for it). I also took the whole package with the Walk with Buddha, the boat trip to the fishing village, etc. it was all worth it. The boat trip was nice, the hike upstairs to the the Buddha was great (not that difficult at all), and the walk with the Buddha show was ok. I'd recommend to start early to avoid the lines and the rain. But if you have a day in HK (started at 8:30 and finished about 3pm), go ahead and do this. The views from up top are great and the fishing village and boat ride are great as well."

From the cars you can see the planes taking off & landing @ the airport, see visitors actually walking the path to/from the Buddha and everything in between. There are over 200+ stairs (1 way) to the top of the Buddha so come in comfortable shoes and with plenty of water. If you are staying @ the airport Marriott, the shuttle will take you to the cable ride. The shuttle run every 20-30 mins. There is a huge outlet mall where you can find just about every store you want, eateries and a grocery store on the bottom level. This area has a lot of walking but it's a lot quieter than downtown HK."

The queue was long, if you want to jump the queue, you could take the 3 in 1 combo ticket. We didn't and was advise it may be a bit late to see everything, the last bus out of the Tai-O village was 4.30pm and last cable car was 6pm. ended up getting only the cable car ride. Enjoyed so much on the cable car for 25min. just chill and relax to see the nice surrounding. While up the hill, we check on the public bus to Tai-O and was lucky they had extra services thus we don't have to wait another 30min. Jumped on it and off to see the fishing village.Once arrived, there are lots of people to ask you to take the boat. Do check if it's low tide now, we got con to take the full boat ride and was told it's low tide and can't go into the pole houses.But we were just as happy, we saw lots of pink Dolphins, magnificent! Back to the hill, we managed to climbed the 200plus steps up to see the big Buddha. Say a little prayer for my family on the way up. Looking at the Big Buddha and surrounding, it's just breath taking. In order to avoid the rush to get to the cable car before 6pm and took another scenic ride back. Advise to go early. We took around 1 hr on cable car. 1 hr plus to Tai-O, spend another 1 hr at the Big Buddha. No time for the rest of the island.But still had a great time there!"

Yes you get to see dams and HK's main prison, such a bonus. It's not Disney it's just the real Hong Kong with real people. As for the Big Buddha, yes worth a visit, take some tablets for the long stairs up. The local Buddhist vegetarian cafe in the Po Lin monastery, take a punt and don't ask exactly what you are eating, we couldn't figure it out, tasted OK though. On the way back again use the buses with your Octopus card, cheaper than the expensive cableway down to the main town Tung Shung where you can hit the DFS shopping. All in a good day out."

The Monastery that is near the Big Buddha is also worth a look. Just remember its an active monastery and there is no meat allowed in the picnic areas surrounding it. Theres a \"village\" that you walk through to get from the cable car to the stairs up to the Buddha and its your typical Western mall experience - so if you're looking for \"normal\" food..thats your best bet. If you're willing to be more adventurous, hit up the little bbq place just past the village. The rest of the island is great for a wander. There are gardens and villages to explore. You can spend hours just working your way around the island. Its worth it."

I was actually not prepared for the length of the lines to access the cable car and if I had of known the length of the wait to access the cars I would have opted for the local bus from the start, yes it is summer and high season but the crowds were hidden away from where you buy your tickets. I upset the staff when my husband and I were placed in a car where we could not sit together and I didn't want the other occupants moved so we could sit together. The reason this upset them was because we wouldn't be together for the souvenir photo that the cable car tries to entice you to buy. The shopping village on the way to the Buddha was lovely without being hassled to buy anything. One of the highlights for me in the market stalls closer to the monastery was that I was able to replace some wooden beads that I have been trying to replace for 12 months, again there was no hard sell. We ate lunch at the monastery restaurant which I can now say was the best 3 course meal we had the whole 3 weeks were away. I highly recommend the food there. The Buddha was originally shrouded in cloud when I first saw it which only increased my desire to get there. The day we were there the Buddha bw as clouded in, in full sun and later it looked like there was a storm brewing. Each and every different look of the Buddha was beautiful. The climb up the stairs was difficult in the humidity but to get to the top was so exciting and well worth it. The free wi fi in the village was a bonus and allowed us to pick up some email messages and send some facebook photos. The bus ride down the hill and into the town was much more exciting than the cable car ride and heaps cheaper. We got to see the cattle, the beach, and meet some locals all while hurtling down the hill and then exceptionally slowly up the other side, all the time, thinking we were in the little train ghost could...I think I can, I think I can. And we did make it on the bus. I had waited since my first trip to Hong Kong in 2006 to come to Lantau Island and visit the monastery and this day did not disappoint us. We will return again in the very near future."

Be prepared for a bit of a wait for the cable car and don't get angry when over zealous (possibly mainland) Chinese tourists push in front of you for their photos etc.You get to the island by either MTR or by ferry then a bus. We decided to take the ferry to the island (a one hour voyage with good views) and then a bus from the ferry terminal to the Cable Car. On the way back we took the MTR. Having said that, make sure that when you do the cable car ride you have your own camera at the read, the views of the surrounds are rather good. I went on a particularly overcast day so visibility was not great. I was expecting something laid back and rural feeling when I got to the top of the mountain after the cable car. I was wrong, expect Subway, Starbucks as well as many clothing and food stores. Overall, though very very tourist orientated it is a good way to spend a day. Wear good walking shoes though."

Suggest going during the weekday > still there is a queue, but 15 mins which is acceptable. The staff will come round the queue line to suggest you to take their 3-hr package to avoid the queue which is triple the price, but with coach & guide. Actually, there is no need to have a guide because the place is not very big & you can take a bus to Tai-O Fishing Village at the bus stn on the right as you walk along the footpath to the Big Buddha. The bus is every 20min pass the hour & you just have to plan your time, but the staff will use this as their selling point for the package. Many restaurants & eateries up here & tea house. Citygate Mall is at Tung Chung MTR Stn where the facyory outlets are located with many restaurants, supermarkets & cafes."

The cable car ride was about 20 mins, we did not take the crystal cabin which had transparent bottoms because I had a fear of height (haha). The views were beautiful from the cable car cabin and it was magical to pass through clouds. When we were approaching the final stop Ngong Ping, we could see the Big Buddha statue in a distance. From Ngong Ping, we took a bus ride of 20 mins down the hill to visit the fishing village of Tai O. It must have been a busy place during the weekends, but we were there on a Tuesday, so it was more quiet and quaint. We spend $20HK on a 15-20 min boat ride out to see the wild dolphins, but it was too hot and probably too many boats around, so we did not see any dolphins. Still the ride was nice with the sea breeze and a quick look at the village from the sea. I guess I would recommend going early in the morning if you want to see the dolphins, but I am not sure if there really would be any. This makes a good day trip to get away from the city life of HK."

            "review": "Nice view!. First suggestion : try to go on weekdays, so there won't be a lot of people :) We took the MTR to Tung Chung where you have to continue to ride a cable car up to the big Buddha. There are two types of cable car; the standard one (normal one) or a Crystal one. The standard one costs 150 HKD for round trip and Crystal cable is 230 HKD. The crystal cabin, you can see through the glass under your feet to see the scenery, not suitable for anyone who scares of height though, so have a look which one suits you the best.The ride up to takes around 30-40 mins (if I am not mistaken) quite a while.. you can enjoy the view :) it's actually nice. People suggest us to go in the morning, but in the morning we have others things to do, so we went there in the afternoon. Turn out that it was a great decision! we went there like 2 pm and there was no line, not a lot of people. While we were going up, there's quite a bunch of people coming down the hill. So, afternoon is not a bad idea at all to pay a visit, but one thing you must consider is that it is really heat up - the sun and everything - so in the cabin it is really like a sauna! and don't forget your sunglasses! because the sun is really really strong! Once you arrived, you will be in a small village filled with shops and activities for you such as walking with Buddha (as far as i remember) it quite a lot of activities and things to do though apart from going up to a very famous big Buddha. Unfortunately, we didn't try that..so can't really comment :( To get to the big Buddha, you have to take the stairs, which is quite a few steps; 100-200? not sure. Make sure you wear a comfortable shoes, it helps :) (I saw someone walked with her high heels up to the Buddha, and it seems really hard!!) up there you will get a spectacular view :) it is really really nice and really really a hugh Buddha!!! :D worth a visit :) Take a bottle of water with you, you might need it after a walk-up or if you don't mind to pay - there is a shop up there with the water costs 8 HKD that is acceptable.Pity didn't have time to explore an island much, but for sure next time! It is a great place to visit even though for short-time visitors. You can actually spend a whole day exploring Lantau island! Amazing view!"

We eventually decide to take the MTR to Tung Chung then a cable car ride to the island as this is the best way to let our young kids experience the public transport and also enjoy a ride in the crystal cable cars. The MTR was a breeze to use and we were in Tung Chung in no time.When buying tickets for the cable car, the salesperson recommended we take the 3-in-1 land-sea-air package. This gives us access to the cable car, short bus tour and boat ride at Tai O Fish Village. But the best part was the pass enabled us to skip the crazy cable car queues in the blistering hot weather! We were so thankful!So we started by taking the crystal cable car (transparent glass bottom and sides) to the island. It was a fun experience for the kids, they enjoyed the ride which offered spectacular views of HK and its airport from above. Upon reaching the island, there is a rather commercialized retail strip with souvenir shops and eateries. Nothing spectacular. After walking around for abit, we took a short 15 min bus ride to Tai O Village. There was a guide on the bus by the name of Ricky, who was entertaining and knowledgable. He shared some short stories about the island and the village. Upon reaching the village, we boarded a small speed boat which took us on a ride along the coastal strip of the village to see the houses on stilts and its occupants. It was interesting to see and experience the lives of these fishermen and their families. Then we entered the main seas to see the famous pink dolphins. We caught several glimpses of the pink dolphins, although not a fantastic full view of them leaping out of the waters,but it was enough to satisfy the kids and the adults alike.After the boat ride, we were given 45 minutes to explore the island, which were mainly shops selling dried seafood. Also there were eateries and convenience shops. It was a truly authentic experience. The tour bus then took us back to the point where we boarded it, and we were led by the guide to visit the Big Buddha. A very large and majestic statue where you have to climb more than 200 steps to reach the top, and enjoy the views. At the bottom of the statue if you do not wish to climb, there is Po Lin Monastery. After that you can walk back to the cable car station and take a ride back to Tung Chung MTR, which was where we started. Along the way, we spotted a small eatery which had a huge banner advertising its famous \"homemade beancurd made from spring water\". We stopped for a dessert and drinks. It was delicious! Lip-smacking good!!!The entire excursion took us about 5 hours. I enjoyed the idyllic and authentic experience and would urge anyone with kids to take this tour. Something fun and away from the noise and bustle of HK!"

You then get a bus from the front of the ferry stand but make sure you have the correct money or an octopus card as drivers don't give change. There are quite a few shops across the road if you need to break notes. I would strongly suggest the octopus card which covers most public transport. Bus ride is a fantastic 40 minutes through lush countryside where it stops up near the monastery. If it's cloudy it can be difficult to see the Budda but it worth seeing the statues and the Budda itself is huge. You can pay to go inside and get a free ice cream at the foot of the massive stairway, it is a long way up. Defo worth a visit."

After being picked up from my hotel we were. taken to Central to catch the ferry to Lantau where our bus was waiting. We were told Lantau is 95% country park and 90% government-owned (or is it the other way round?). Anyway most of it being owned by government is why there are four prisons on the island. I gather the reason it isn't like Hong Kong Island and Kowloon re development is primarily historical as it and the new territories were designated a buffer zone for the Brits against China and the deal was they would not be developed.First we went to Ceung Sha beach then to Tai O fishing village where we did a short boat trip through the village on stilts and our guide took us to a little but old temple there. Apparently many of the village's residents have government-provided accommodation on land but most prefer their village on stilts. Next we had a beautiful drive up through the jungle to Ngong Ping where we visited the Giant Buddha statue. Apparently this bronze statue was made in enormous sections in Nanjing and welded together at its site on Lantau. And it is one big statue! You can go inside the base and see 4 large pieces of artwork on Buddha's life. From the viewing platform and the lower viewing platforms with the statues, you get a lovely view down to the coast on a day not too smoggy. We had a great vegetarian lunch at Po Lin Monastery and time to have a look round and a walk through Ngong Ping village to catch the cable car back down to near the airport, then bus back to hotel. The cable car ride down was spectacular. Great views and you see planes take off and land below you."

On my last visit to Hong Kong which was 2012 , we had planned to go to Lantau but somehow it did not happen , we had been here of course in one sense as it is where HK airport is situated , but this time we took the ferry which was lovely as you see all the HK skyline as you are sailing out to sea & then all the surrounding Islands of which there are so many . When we arrived we took a bus ride to the other side of the Island & that in itself was very interesting passing some lovely beaches & countryside.Our destination was to see the fishing village with the houses built on stilts, quite amazing. Then up & down the narrow little streets where most of the stalls were selling guess what.... fish , most dried but not all . Here on the Island we saw many , many cats which I thought strange as we only saw one cat in all our time in HK but then when we saw many rats beneath the stilt houses we realized the reason for the cat population.Finally after quite a lot of walking we boarded the bus back , but then instead of taking the ferry we caught the train all the way to the center of Hk again . I would recommend this trip to anyone who has the time to do it , as it is a completely different face of Hong kong away from the high rise buildings & shops & markets. A real breath of fresh air."

Buy Octopus card (in every metro station), with this one you can pay in all kinds of public transportation and it's very cheap. 2. Take the metro to the end of the yellow line (hard to miss as on every metro map you'll see an icon of cable car next to the station's name...that's how I navigate)3. Take one way trio in standard cable car to giant Buddha (you can take a crystal one but they are fewer of those so you'll end up waiting longer than standard cable car and all you see just some green under your feet...and almost price is almost twice as much than standard). Unless you are really want to take the boat tour don't take the combo ticket, you'll end up paying more.4. When done with the Buddha just take bus 21 to Tai O (fishermen's village). It'll cost around 7 HKD and you can use your octopus card.5. In Tai O you can either take the bout tour (which is still cheaper if you buy it there) or just walk around and actually feel the atmosphere. For food go to local places (nothing with wester touch in the name or you'll pay twice the normal price)6. When done take bus number 1 to Mui Wo pier to catch a ferry to Central (again can be paid with Octopus card and takes around 30 minutes)To summarize: don't be afraid of using public transportation and pay at the moment as it gives you huge flexibility of destinations and goes easy on your budget.Good luck out there!"

However, it is very important to know when to visit Lantau - ie. depending on the season as this is badly impact the visibility. The ride into Lantau Island through the cable car was interesting and luckily we got on the glass floor cable on the way up when it was still not that misty/foggy. So we manage to see the view of the island and the greenary was just fantastic. Depending on what you would like to do at Lantau, you can get the package tickets with the cable car trip.I didn't find the food any good at the main eatery area. I guess that is what you have to manage when its a touristy area. Try the hot sausages on the way in or out from the temple / Po Lin monastery. Its pretty expensive but really nice! :)"

The parks have special designated place where car owners can stop and eat out in the free. The ways to travel on the island are comfortable as shuttle buses connect the whole island to each other. Although it hosts the airport unless you are nearby, its in the north of the island, you won't be annoyed by it. Several authentic fishing villages in the west are worth visitng as the big buddha statue is and the small beaches at its south coast are. For a day in Disneyland go to the east side from Hong Kong easy accessable by the public transport MTR. To cool down have a swim in the sea in nearby discovery bay.

This was a full day trip by coach to the island. Started at 8:15 and finished back at hotel by 3:30pm. I can thoroughly recommend this tour to all age groups and types. It was informative the guides spoke good English, they were funny . The tour includes a visit to Tai O fishing village with traditional stilt homes and it's still occupied by traditional fisherman regardless of the tourist visits. On toPo Lin Monastery and the huge bronze sitting Buddha . Whilst on the mountain the mist rolled in adding a eerie and mystical feel to the surroundings the sun came out again in time for some good photo shoots. Then it was down by cable car with great views of lantau. Nothing was too rushed or too lingered and we also had a great vegetarian lunch at the monastery . Really enjoyed the scenery , is was a good relief from the concrete jungle of kowloon. Thanks again Splendid Tours."

From there you can walk to Big Buddha and walk around the many stalls in the village. A TIP - there are cable cars there which take you back to Hong Kong, they are faster than the bus obviously but very expensive when in fact you can take a bus from the village (same one you came on) and pay next to nothing and get the benefit of the nice views:-) Take your time on Lantau Island, it is pleasanf and a trip to be savoured and not rushed :-)"

If it is not misty, the cable car should be a great view, it was so misty so I did not take that down to Tung Chung.It was a hike from Pak Kung Au - I took #11 - exit b from MTR and at the opposite end of the terminus. You can also take 23, 3M. You have to tell the driver where you want to drop as it is not obvious, it was at the top of a long climb for the bus before it starts going downhill about 15min off from terminus. My driver forgot about me and I ended up walking up the slope back to the starting point. The stone sign on the ground at the start of stage 3 trail for Pak Kung Au is relatively small. There are some picnic benches behind the bus stop in the return direction, I.e. On the right when you are going there.There you start distance post L018 and you just keep going up and up and up heading west. In the mist I don't see where I am going and the wind is pretty strong, which worried me that I get lost. I was alone on a weekday. Not the best day but it was the last day possible for me on the trip.Fairly challenging, it took me 3hr to reach ngong ping as I was going slower since visibility was poor, you stick to the trail and you would not get lost. Took a lunch break at the peak. It was rather wet with the mist, I was with baselayer top and bottom which helps with the sweat, hiking boots, walking sticks, knee guard.Reached wisdom path in the mist and it was quite mystical since it was so quiet on a weekday. Only met 2 persons during the hike.The steps to the Buddha felt so easy comparatively, with the face covered in mist and occasionally dispersing to show. Got some incense at the temple on the other side for hk$20, it was a huge bunch and 3 larger pieces of joss stick, took some time to light them up. Inside the temple there is a food place, you can get a beancurb pudding and some dessert, food - inexpensive. Beancurb for hkd$10Would be great if the weather is better. Safer not to go alone else be prepared with mobile phone, whistle and other emergencies necessities."

Having travelled to HK numerous times over the past ten years, and always been tempted by the sights of Lantau Island, this time we finally took the plunge and visited. Travelling to Lantau Island is possible in a variety of ways. Indeed, lots of people say that the best was is by taking the MTR to Tung Chung, but by doing so, I feel that you will miss out on lots of other sites.I think that the best option is to take the ferry from Central over to Lantau Island. The journey takes around an hour and again offers great sites of the HK coastline. Upon arrival, take the bus which winds through the countryside up to Ngong Ping. This offers a great insight into lots of other things that Lantau Island can offer...the beaches and nature trails in particular are worth a mention.Upon arrival at Ngong Ping, take a couple of hours to marvel at the Giant Buddha statue and the sights from the peak, especially if visiting on a clear day. End the trip with the cable car trip back down to Tung Chung from where you can board the MTR back to Kowloon/HH Island."

After all the city visits and shopping, this is a perfect spot for some soothing, scenic sights and serene relaxation.Lantau Island is reachable by the 360 degree cable car - which already provides amazing sights along the way over here. It travels over mountains and waters, leaving one anticipating for more.Lantau Island is spacious, a lovely nature spot offering magnificent sights. The closeness to the skyline makes one feel tranquil and at peace, and even magical as though we could simply reach out and touch the clouds.The grand Buddha statue is lovely, and imposes a sense of halcyon in us. Many people come up here to relax, worship, take photos and simply seek solace from a stressful lifestyle.This is a lovely spot and a must-see for all tourists.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/cruising-china-shenzhen.html"

Next we took a bus to tai-o village. It had gotten pretty crowded by then n it took us 30 mins of waiting to get the bus. The lady conductor on the bus made us pay 50hkd n didnt give us a ticket or change. The tai-o boat ride for the stilt houses was strictly ok. We didnt get to see any dolphins.

When we arrived via MTR, we decided not to spend money on the cable car ride because we wouldn't have been able to see anything through the gray haze and the low clouds which covered the tops of the hills.We also decided not to tour the temple, after touring more than half a dozen Asian temples in the past couple weeks. They all start to look alike. That left a visit to Tai O and the outlet mall at Tung Chung.We did ride the bus 45 minutes to Tai O, which was disappointing after all the hype. The journey itself was pretty, riding up and down the hills of the island.We spent about an hour walking the mall, which has a lot of the same stores you find in North American malls. I almost bought some unique mint chocolate malted balls from a chocolatier and then put it back after the cashier wanted to charge us about $14 US for 3 ounces of candy. That's $90 US per pound !!!!!The mall's food court was disappointing (nothing but Asian cuisine), as were the handful of restaurants outside the mall.  If you're going to Lantau, be sure to go on a sunny day because, without the cable car ride, there isn't much else to do."

Food stalls around Giant Buddha also have some of the best \"do fu fa\" (a sweet tofu dessert) that we have ever had which is supposedly made with their \"mountain water.\" Great way to spend half a day. We took cable car only one way and then caught a bus from Ngong Ping (#21) to Tai O fishing village, Hong Kong's oldest fishing village (we joked that it was HK's version of Venice with its stilt houses), then another bus (#1) to Mui Wo, another low-key town to catch a ferry back to Central.

I was a little worried about figuring out how to visit Tai O fishing village, but the bus area is clearly marked with signs and bus times are posted at the stop. The ride to the village takes roughly 15 minutes and exploring the village takes an hour or two. We did the boat ride to see the Chinese white dolphins and the fisherman fishing.

We climbed to see the giant Buddha perched on top of one of the mountains, not on foot, (which is possible but would take many hours), but on the Ngong Ping Cable Car 360 skyrail cable car. The views are stunning all the way. At the top we not only visited the giant Buddha, but also were entranced by the Po Lin Monastery and the delicious vegetarian meal offered there. A further highlight of the day was our visit to the Tai-O Fishing Village which is built on stilts and is still a busy working village full of atmosphere. Our tour included a sampan ride out to where the fresh water and the sea meet. There we were thrilled to see the famous pink/white dolphins frolicking in the sea. They put on such a fantastic show, leaping and swimming quite close to our sampan. Then we returned to our Kowloon hotel, descending via the cable car once again.

The ferry ride is part of the fun, and the island is very different to the rest of HK, being peaceful and quiet. The absence of cars helps. You can catch the ferry to one side of the island, then walk across a well-maintained path to the other where the ferry will pick you up again. At both ends there are seafood restaurants competing for your business. Don't be put off by the powerstation - its not hte most attractive viewonthe island!"

They are in blocks of 16 so you can stop on the way for photos and catch your breath. Toilets can be found near the restaurants which are clean and western style. Plenty of places to buy lunch and a drink - well worth the trip. We paid extra and had a \"crystal\" cable car which gives you a cable car with a glass see through bottom. To be honest the views from outside the car were better than looking down but still a nice view either way. Highly recommended"

We took the ferry to Mui Wo from pier 6, you van kist check in with your octopus card, and it takes about 30 minutes. The bus ride is really an experience. Most tourists take the bus directly to Ngong Ping (where the big Buddha and the monastery are located). Once arrived at Mui Wo we took bus 3M, also check in with the octopus card, to Tung Chung. Over there we took the cable train to Ngong Ping. I would suggest booking your ticket on the internet, on a Sunday it will save you 60 minutes waiting. The cable train takes you to Ngong Ping and also offers an awesome view over the airport. When you've seen everything at Ngong Ping take the bus (21) to Tai O. An old fishing village, you can take a boat trip to see the dolphins and sail between the old houses. From Tai O take the bus back to Tung Chuck and travel back to Kowloon or Hong Kong by metro."

We took the cable cars up(and took bus back down bc it's A LOT cheaper). It is a cool place to walk around and see the more nature side of Hong Kong. We also visited Tai O fishing village as other reviews have stated. It is super easy to get there..you just have to go to where the buses are located &I get on bus 21 I think? It runs every 20-30 mins and it takes you right to the village! It was so neat to see the way people live on the water & the slower pace of life. If you do visit Lantau island I hope you make the short trip to Tai O bc it is so worth it! After we were finished at the fishing village we just took another bus back to the subway where we started the day! Some people say it was an all day event but we were there maybe 3 hours:) if you go early in the morning there isn't that long of a line for the cable cars so that helped a lot!"

Having a little extra time, I decided to drop by Lantau on the way to the airport. Tip: I checked in through the Airport Express terminals in the city (Love this service!) and went to Tsing Yi via the Airport express (hardly 15 min) and then to the Tung Chung station via the orange line. From there, Just 5 mins walk to the Ngong Ping 360 Cable car.The Crystal cable car was amazing. I have done many cable cars in the past, so wasnt looking forward to the normal (non crystal cable car). But Crystal Cabin is a good difference. We took many photos sitting on the floor of the cabin. The idea of floating in the air and seeing people, trees, water below you was very nice.After the cable car, we walked to the big buddha. It was mid february & very very cold. But the feel was very 'country-side', which was a delight after 3 days in Hong Kongs Hustle bustle. I got the feel of China (I suppose - since I havent yet been to Mainland), with mountains on 1 side and the big buddha on another, with chinese architecture and small country side shops. Even the dogs there looked like lions with all their thick fur. There are quite a few restaurants too - perfect tourist spot but not very commercialized, keeping the calm & serene feel!On our way back, we took the bus back to Tsing Yi - goes every 20 mins and takes around 40 mins to reach there. This was good too, as we could see the sunset all the way, turning left right, up & down the hill. Tip: There is an express bus to the airport - A1 - takes only 10 mins from Tsing Yi to the airport - super convenient.In brief, with the Lantau Island, I left Hong Kong with very nice memories!"

It has a transparent floor, and lets you be surrounded by the amazing views of the airport, mountains and grasslands. The ride takes around 25 minutes.Once you step foot into the place, it is so soothing and peaceful, especially compared to the noise, lights and crowds of Hong Kong. Everyone is quiet and very respectful. Before walking the steps towards the Big Buddha, purchase a ticket that allows access into private areas of the temple and it includes a meal ticket as well. The meal was very satisfying and included so much food. You can also buy incense to light as blessings to the Gods and for your loved ones. I suggest people to drop a small donation in the donation box as the temple is going through renovations. Walking down the steps, and around the area, you will see a lot of souvenir shops. We bought a wishing plate, which was similar to a wooden square, where we could write a wish, and hang it on a special tree. In return, you get to keep a small bag of crystals which symbolised keeping the wish safe and true. Overall, visiting Lantau Island was a great experience. It was the best attraction where you could get to see the cultural side of Hong Kong, and have a relaxing and valuable day. Will definitely keep coming back on future holidays!"

From here we took a taxi to Pak Kung Au. it was very cheap like all the cabs in HK From here the trail starts towards Lantau Peak. If you have no hiking experience or you hate walking \"stairs\" i advise to skip this hike.It can be hard at times and it is very important you bring enough water and a jacket for the cold air when you are walking \"in the clouds\". After 2 hours we were above the clouds and that was a spectacular view. After we reached the top we went down on the other side of the mountain towards Ngong Ping.(Big Buddha)It is a long hike down and after you reached Ngong Ping you can take the cable car back to Tung Chung.We enjoyed this walk very much."

The tour bus picked us up at the hotel and then after a couple more pick ups we were dropped off at the ferry terminal to board the catamaran ferry to Island. There we got on another coach and had a great tour of a beach, where they have a flag warning about sharks in the water! Then we went on to a fishing village built on stilts and boarded a smaller boat for a tour between the houses then back on the bus to climb the hill to the giant Buddha. We then had veggie lunch at the monastery before saying goodbye to our guide and boarding the cable car to take us back to another coach that took us back to Hong Kong Island.I would recommend a guided tour. You can get to the giant Buddha via the cable car but with a guide you get much more out of the trip. Taker advantage of all the recommended toilet stops as some of the loos can be a bit hit or miss literally. Plan for a long time at the giant Buddha and monastery to take in ambience. As usual there are too many trinket sellers there but this is to be expected I guess. Things tended to be more expensive that at the markets so take care.Be prepared to be jostled and to be photo bombed by people who cannot see any further than the end of the nose but once they realise they have ruined a good shot most will apologise. Best remedy is to offer a big smile and retake the shot.We found people only to keen to take our photograph but remember to act with decorum as this shrine means a lot to some people.Also it tends to be a cash only place unless you venture Into some of the more quality shops and then visa is okay.Finally so much can depend on the guide. Ours was witty, knowledgeable and kept the day rolling along. We used Lantau Tours Limited booked through trailfinders but most hotels have their brooches.Make friends with your fellow bus buddies and share a tail or two. In our cable car we had four Aussies, one kiwi, one German and two Brits. "

Ranging from the vintage Tai O fishing village which provides stark contrast to modern, urban Hong Kong, to the outstanding Hong Kong Airport and the Po Lin Monastery with its 34 meter Giant Buddha, Lantau has moved well beyond the huge largely undeveloped island, unconnected to primary Hong Kong except by ferry to an easily accessible and fascinating tree covered, mountainous spot with accessible and interesting sights. The cable car to the monastery is about a 25 minute journey with great views of the natural landscape, modern airport and hikers making the arduous trek across the island. The cable car is a short walk from the MTR ration. Lines can be very long on holidays but a small extra fee can give you VIP access to avoid the lines. The 360 tour is worthwhile for first time visitors as it gets you down to the fishing village and on the water as well as gives you background on the monastery and Giant Buddha. From the general monastery elevation, you can also access the Buddha statue directly via a 268 step climb. Plan a full day. The day we visited the last cable car back down the mountain departed at 6:30."

We went to the walking with the Buddha show (give it a miss - you can read all about it) - Buddha is a lot of step stairs but with rest areas easy to make the journey - buses can drop you there at the back of the Buddha. The temple was undergoing a makeover so only a small portion was available to view - this makeover will be undertaken for a while yet. We then made our way by bus to Tai O (fishing village) - and took a ride on a boat and it really shows the harsh conditions people live in. The boat ride also took as out to the bay and was not for the faint hearted. Then we travelled throughout the island on the bus networks and found some beaches which would be nice during the summer months - this also was included on our pass. We definitely saw a lot more than other people did. Recommend this as a definite."

Fast & effortless line-up for our turn to board the car (we were 5th in line). Scenic view on the way to Ngong Ping and many stairs climb up to Big Buddha, but not too tedious. Take your own time. The air was cool and chilly, making the climb quite pleasant. Not sure if there are wheelchair access though, please check. We skipped the entrance fee to \"Walking with Buddha\" and gave the vegetarian meal a miss. You can pay to see the Buddha's relic if you want. Po Lin monastery was closed for renovation, only did a 5mins quick tour around its ground outside. We bought a souvenir magnet at one of the shops and then hit the bus 21 to Tai O fishing village using our Octopus card. Total time required for Lantau: (+/-) 1 hour just to sight-see, snap some pictures, buy some souvenirs. Otherwise, not much to do here (in Lantau) and there's no need to pay for touristy gimmicks in my opinion."

We also took a bus ride down to the fishing village on stilts. They dry everything they catch from the sea and even dry egg yolks! I think it's a must see. There's also a boat ride to take you up the inlet a bit to see the stilt houses from the water and then out to see the pink dolphins but don't count on seeing them. I think it was cheaper to catch this bus using the Octopus card then buying the tickets when you buy your cable car ride."

It is literally 3-4 hour wait in line.In addition to saving money and not lining up (which I hate for anything) the Taxi ride to the top wraps itself around almost the entire island for a super cool roughly an hour tour of the island. We were really really happy we took the taxi up. However you absolutely must take the Cable car back down it is not to be missed. Attractions and views at the top were great. Loved the old temples (not so impressed with Big Buddha, built in 1993 really?? see my review of it) No line up at all for the Cable car back down and incredable views the whole way down with a glass bottom cable car. Was a great say trip. Do not miss Lantau Island on your trip."

To take this tour you can either take the direct route by MTR rapid transit line from the Olympic City stop, to the end of the line which is termed Lantau island cable car stop (this stop is also where you'd get off to visit the outlet mall for all the major high end retailers ). I'd suggest you buy your tickets in advance with the Big Bus tour company instead of at the tour site itself so as to avoid the horrific throngs of people lining up to buy tickets; getting your tickets in advance will help you bypass this craziness and speed to the front of the line ....in Asia, bypassing any line-up will make you feel like a celebrity (trust me on this).Upon getting to the tour location, you'd take the cable car to the top of the peak, where you will enter a village of sorts - this makeshift village was constructed to entice shoppers to buy trinkets etc. before you get to your tour bus. The tour bus takes you to the traditional fishing village which is very rustic, with houses built on stilts in the water. There's variety of shops selling dried sea creatures, herbal stores and bar-b-q stalls selling wares - I'd definitely suggest the Bar-b-q pork or beef which is delish!!After returning from the fishing village, you can tour the monastery right beside the second largest Buddha in Asia. ( I forgot to mention that you will see stunning views of the statue from the gondola when you are about to enter the tour destination).To get to the Buddha! you'd have to climb 260 steps which is not too bad and definitely worth the view of the surrounding hillside when you reach the summit."

We read several reviews about how to get there as well as what to eat when we arrived.How to get there:We had read that the cable car ride would take a long time if we didn't leave early. We were on vacation so we didn't want to leave at 6am. We left from Tseung Kwan O MTR around 9:15am and arrived at Tung Chung MTR about 10am. We took the MTR to Central and then took the Tung Chung Line. When we arrived, the line for the cable car was completely full to go up to the temple. It was not going to be an hour wait in line. There was a bridge completely full of people that lead all the way down and wrapped around itself 4-5 times. Then the place we were going to stand in line was on the ground and wrapped around itself 2 times. THE LINE DID NOT MOVE. We were looking for buses that would take us up to the temple but there was no where to purchase a seat for these buses. We saw about 20 buses parked around the lines but they were all empty. We nearly left to go do something else. However, we found a blue colored taxi that would drive us up to the temple. It costed us $158 HKD. It was well worth the money. The drive took us approximately 30 mins. ****Tip**** I would suggest anyone travelling up to the temple to take a blue taxi or stand in line for 2-3 hours to buy a cable car ticket. On the way back, pay for the Crystal Cable Car ride and you will be put in a short line to take the cable car down.Food/Attractions:I initially thought that this venture would lead us to an austere, reverent holy place but I could not have been more wrong. Before we could get to the temple and the Big Buddha, there were a lot of shops, restaurants, and even a Starbucks. We walked up to see the Buddha. It looked very cool. The photos we took were iconic. The views were amazing. Then we headed to the temple. We had read that the vegetarian food at the temple would be amazing. After reading several reviews, it appeared there was only one vegetarian restaurant at the temple to eat at and we would have to purchase a ticket at the entrance to eat at it. We spent about $300 HKD for admission and the preset vegetarian meal and we received a yellow ticket to show the restaurant. BIG MISTAKE. DON'T BUY THIS MEAL TICKET.The temple itself was under some construction and looks no different than any modern temple you could find around the world. When we went to eat the vegetarian lunch, we were directed to a restaurant where they gave us 4 dishes. We first got a potato soup. (2/5 stars) Then we received 4 dishes. There was a tofu dish with corn and other vegetables. It tasted just like canned corn. (1/5 stars) There was a deep fried dish that looked like big egg rolls. It tasted like the oil it was fried in and had no other taste. (1/5 stars) There was an assorted vegetable dish of baby bok choy and mushrooms. (2.5/5 stars) There was a cucumber, celery and tofu dish that was bland. Completely tasteless or if it had a taste it tasted bad. (0/5 stars) There was a Vegetarian Deli right next door to this restaurant that had amazing dishes for sale. There was an amazing assortment of vegetarian dishes to select from and you could choose what you wanted to eat. The curry tofu dish looked amazing and I would have had some but I was already full from the crap food above. ****Tip**** Don't buy the preset meal from the temple. Buy food from the Vegetarian Deli. FYI: The bathrooms are generally holes in the ground."

Go for the air conditioned VIP room to beat the heat, if you can wait. We visited during December, so this was no problem. Take at least a couple of hours for the Big Buddah and Po Lin Monastery. There was a big addition to the monastery during our visit, so this section might take more time in the future.Take a hike along Wisdom Path.

Thor Chan, the concierge at the Langham Hotel Kowloon, recommended this tour to Lantau Island to see the big Buddha.The tour included a visit to the Tsing Ma Bridge that is the longest road/rail suspension bridge in the world. From the Visitor Center, the views are fantastic and the gardens peaceful.From the stop at the bridge, we continued on to Lantau Island which is quite the contrast to Hong Kong Island and Kowloon in that it is sparsely settled and quite mountainous. Disneyland is located on this island though we did not go.Once on Lantau, our guide took us to the Tai O Fishing Village to see the stilt houses. Part of the tour included a ride on a sampan to see the houses from the water side. At this stop there is time to shop in the market and visit a temple that dates back to the 1400's and another tiny temple dating back to the 1700's that is adjacent to the older one.The tour continued on to the Po Lin Monastery where the world's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha is located. I have to say that the Buddha is quite impressive. Be sure to go inside and up to the third level where you can catch the views. We also had an included vegetarian lunch that was very good.From the monastery you can walk through a small village for shopping and instead of taking the tour bus back to Lantau town, we took the 25 minute ride through and over the mountains on the Ngong Ping cable car. The cable car takes you over the international airport.Message me if you'd like to know the name of the sightseeing company that the hotel used."

There is also a ticket for the vegetarian snacks set. But I think it is better to just go and pick whatever you like. They are famous for their soya bean curd.

Unless you have major vertigo issues, I highly recommend the 'Crystal cabin' experience. These cable cars have transparent floors, which gives you an amazing under the car view too! You feel as though you are flying! Amazing experience. (Only wish it was longer, but the experience was the best!)Once you reach the Island, you can walk around the Ngong Ping village, which has stores selling some beautiful local merchandise. The walk upto the Big Buddha could be a little difficult for people with knee problems due to some steps, but if you can try, its worth the climb. You will not be rushed, so take all the time to climb up.Once at the base of the Big Buddha statue, its a beautiful & serene view ... you see green/blue ocean, small islands, mountains/hills full of greenery, fog/mist. You will have to see the view to experience it, words cannot do justice! The whole experience was amazing, even though people & kids were screaming all over, it was still a place where one can feel peaceful from within.While returning back, try to time your return cable trip along with the sunset time, the views are unparallel!Highly recommend this trip!Note: The wait time to get a ticket & then board the cable car could be pretty long (1.5-2 hours), so ideally try to reach there early.There is no fee to visit the Big Buddha, but the cable car costs about HKD 230 for Crystal cabin."

The Tian Tan Buddha is worth a visit and the 300 steps to the top aren\u2019t really that hard. My 2 1/2 year old daughter managed to climb them both ways with no problem and I make a point of saying this because she\u2019s lazy and normally has her mum carry her everywhere!! The bus/taxi to Tai O fishing village is relatively inexpensive and it is a good opportunity to see a side of the country which hasn\u2019t been taken over by shops!!! I was a bit gutted to have made the journey to Tai O with the specific intent on visiting the Shaolin Wu Shu centre only to find it empty.

The weather was amazing up there and it was cold, so I'd suggest you carry a jacket. There are plenty of options for food like Subway, Pizza Hut and others.

A beautifully maintained area with gardens and statues at the base, indeed an attraction not to be missed. Remember though, later in the day it becomes extremely crowded."

(The wait for a standard car would have been even longer - prebooking is essential.) The views from the cabin were outstanding. We took the MTR round trip from Kowloon for roughly $25 HKD using the Octopus card rate. The round trip crystal cabin cable car was $213 HKD, so this worked out to be a very reasonably priced excursion.I must say that having very well maintained public bathrooms was also a nice feature."

So we were early birds there - and the first ones to climb up the stairs to the Big Buddha. What a treat for our camera, we took the nicest photos ! The statue itself and the monastery area is really worth a visit, the village there is nicely built but a tourist-trap. If you take the Cable car you have to pass through the village - not for us but it is built in a way that it doesn't disrupt the monastery area.We strolled the \"Wisdom Path\", a nice thing to do up there too. Being tired from the overseas flight and troubled by high temperatures and extreme humidity we didn't hike back down although it is recommended - but took the Cable car which gives you stunning views of Lantau. Definetly worth a visit !!"

The crystal cabin (glass bottom) is also a must for a unique experience. The views were fantastic throughout the whole cable car ride and we even saw runners below on the trail to Lantau. Great vantage point of planes taking off and landing at the airport. And before long the Big Buddha was also in sight.If you are there in Summer make sure you go earlier when it is not as hot as it is quite a hike up the stairs to see the Big Buddha. For those who are fans of Anita Mui, there is a memorial for her there. If you had purchased the vegetarian meal ticket at the booth at the foot of the stairs, you could get free entry into the upper level where historical relics and paintings are displayed.We made our way back down for the 6 course vegetarian lunch which was not that cheap (HKD312 for 4) but was plentiful. Alternatively, as we later found out, one could actually purchase food at a vegetarian stall there. Since, we still had time, we decided to catch the bus to the Tai-O fishing village. You can use your Octopus card for the bus and it is definitely worth a visit. Here the homes are built on stilts and nearly every stall sold dried seafood. One can take a boat out to see the pink dolphins but we did not opt for that. Another different experience and recommended."

We then decided to catch the bus to Tai O fishing village (6.60$HK each way) this took about 20 mins down the mountain. Was really interesting to see how the locals lived and plenty of opportunities to purchase dried fish should you feel the need! We also took a boat trip (20$ HK each) to see the stilt houses from the inlet and then headed out to sea a short way in search of the elusive pink dolphins. A return bus trip up the mountain before catching the cable car back to the MTR. There is an outlet mall at the station exit which was packed with Saturday shoppers looking for a bargain. All in all a very enjoyable day and although geared up for tourism you felt you were getting a feel for how the rural people live, we even saw cows wandering freely along the roads. The scenery was spectacular.Independent travel in Hong Kong is very easy, the MTR is straightforward and the buses well signed, you do need the correct money as no change given."

It truly has something for everyone. Head over to Pui O or Cheung Sha beach for frolicking in the sand while enjoying food and drink from restaurants on by the water. If it's the best beach you're after, Tong Fuk is your destination. Although there are no restaurants on this beach, the water is always clean, the beach is never crowded, and the scenery is beautiful. The Gallery, one of the best pizza and BBQ joints in Hong Kong, is a five minute walk from the beach. For those looking for a more active time, Lantau has hikes and walks to suit all abilities. You can climb the steep (and challenging) Lantau or Sunset Peaks, or walk from Pak Kung Au to Mui Wo with your kids.For shopping lovers, Tung Chung on Lantau has Hong Kong's only outlet mall. It is full of tourists on weekends so head there on a weekday if you can. If you're too lazy to do anything on Lantau, just hop on the train to Tung Chung and back for one of the most scenic subway rides anywhere.And last but not the least, Lantau also offers three of Hong Kong' s biggest attractions: the cable car, Big Buddha and Disneyland.

We climbed like 80+ stairs to reach the peak and gosh it is worth the sweat. There is also a Martial Arts presentation were children and adults was ''wow!'."

The island is peaceful and quite and can be easily reached using the MTR. There are loads of shops in the outlet mall next to the MTR station, which allow the shopaholic to enjoy the day as well. There are a few hiking trails to the Big Buddha, but they seemed a little tedious. The views from the cable car are lovely. I understand that there are a few good beaches on the island as well, but could not visit any."

I strongly advise that you buy a ticket on line for the cable car and don't get a ticket as you have to wait for 45 minutes in the line for the tickets. The crystal cabin is a bit of a rip off as the crystal cabinb cars occur only one cabins per 3 normal cabins and therefore the line is 3 times as long and the attraction to look down through the floor isn't all that great. Once you get there it it worth while the visit. There is a great Kabab place to eat and the food is not only tasty but reasonably priced for a tourist area. The tourist shops are also reasonable and the items for sale are reasonably priced. You should go up to the Budda statue and go up to the top for a small price as the views are amazing."

I recommend to get your tickets/vouchers ahead so you avoid the wait.The big Buddha to me was just what the name suggests plus a million souvenirs to empty your wallets. Do take tour time to explore different angles to get a more interesting shot.The monastery was under renovation but I enjoyed taking a few shots of people as they were lighting the sticks with a very unique smell.Tai O village was a bit more interesting and more suitable for candid shots. Do head there if you don't mind the strong fish smell.Avoid going back too late so you wont get stuck waiting for a cabin. Enjoy!"

Plus visiting the big Buddha is a must for any HK visit. Greatest disappointment was that the cable cars that take you to the NP village and big Buddha were closed for annual maintenance during my visit (they are closed from 2nd Sept for three weeks atleast). Anyone going to the island should definitely take the Cable car for scenic views (caution: if someone is afraid of heights, then better skip). A must place to go and spend a relaxing half day, away from the hustle and bustle of the city."

My suggestion is to go to Tai O village first with a bus ride. The tour also includes a boat tour in Tai O village where you can see fisherman houses, if you are lucky pink dolphins. then take another bus ( all bus tickets are included in package cost) to Big Buddha, stroll around and take the cable car(cable car ticket is also included) back to where you had bought the tour package. Take the metro to Disneyland from the nearby station, and spend rest of the day enjoying the rides.This route is time saving, cable car starts at 10 am, so you can start your trip earlier by bus to Tai O and avoid long Cable Car queue."

On the route with the locals, you will look down on FANTASTIC BEACHES and OUTSTANDING vegetation, AND along the road side you will see cattle grazing. IT'S THE BEST trip for simply the cost of transportation. Once you get to big buddha, take your time and take the set of 15 steps up to the big buddha. It will we the cleanest freshest air you breath anywhere in China and HK. It's a must!

They seat people very well and considerately. At the top, there is a little tea room that gives a tea ceremony demonstration (can't remember the cost, sorry, but worth it and not expensive). The ladies running the shop are just lovely and the tea is good. There is also a kung fu display and little shops. Great walking around."

Took some snapshots even as we were approaching the island, you can see the Buddha from your cable car already. Many souvenir shops for you to do shopping and the Octopus card can be used in the convenient stores too. Spent a whole afternoon just walking, snapping photos and relaxing.

Climb 268 steps for a closer look at the serene appearance of the Big Buddha and immerse in the spectacular view of the surrounding mountain and sea views that can simply take your breath away. Elderly who are unable to climb the steps could take the free transport provided but do check for availability from the ticketing booth at the foot of the Big Buddha. Another not to miss in Lantau Island is Kwun Yam Temple, which is reachable via bus 21 from Ngong Ping bus terminal. Upon reaching the upper hall of the temple after a short climb, you are greeted with a magnificent sight of the ceiling, which is decorated with 10,000 small Buddhas. In the centre of the hall are 5 big Buddhas seated around in a circular altar. A word of cautious though, remove your socks before you start the climb as the wooden staircase could be a little slippery. Also, shutterbugs like me can keep your cameras away as photography is strictly not allowed here.If you want to see the charm of old Hong Kong, head off to Tai O Fishing Village which is a short ride on bus 21 from Kwun Yam Temple. Over here, you will find stalls selling dried seafood and small eateries serving bean curd, osmanthus jelly, cha kwo. Vegetarian dining is not a problem on Lantau Island, as both Po Lin Monastery near the Big Buddha & Kwun Yam Temple serves equally good vegetarian dishes, though I prefer the latter which is more simple yet tasty. Do take note that Po Lin Monastey's restaurant closes at 4:30 pm while Kwun Yam Temple's dining hall closes at 2pm. Start off the day trip early, catch the earliest cable car to Ngong Ping and by evening you would have attained an eye opener experience. This was in fact, our best & most enjoyable day trip during our 5 days in Hong Kong."

Or leave Tung Cheung and follow the Olympic trail over the island to Mei Woo. We always end our trip near the ferry and a beer and snack at the legendary China Bear.

We didn't, we went by ourselves.We took the cable car to the island which I think at its highest point is 500m above sea level! The cable car journey in itself was a real highlight. I'm ok with heights but felt a little nervous as I queued up and saw cable cars in the distance. Really glad I didn't chicken out as you get to see some great views. You can even pay extra for a cable car with a glass floor if you're brave enough!When you get off the cable car you arrive at a really pretty area with some gift shops and places to eat.Then you can walk to the Tian Tan Buddha. There are many steps to climb to get to the giant Buddha but it is definitely worth it. It was a very humbling experience. There is also a small museum at the top. There is a fee, I can't remember how much but it wasn't expensive. The museum was OK we thought we may as well go seeing as we were at the top anyway but I don't think you'd be missing out on much if you chose not to go to the museum. If you are planning to go to Hong Kong then put a day aside for this."

Take the MTR Tung Chung Line to Tung Chung which itself has a shopping outlet (Citygate Outlet) where you can shop half a day. But do go straight to the 360 Cable Car. Recommend buying tickets online to avoid waiting in the on-site ticket line (which is always very very long!) For thrill of the ride, buy ticket for the crytal cabin which has a glass bottom allowing you to see thing like in a bubble helocopter. On the way up and toward end of the cable car journey, you can see Macao on a clear day. Spend some time going up the great Buddha,visit the monestary, have vegetarian lunch there before heading for Tai O -- the fishing village.Going to Tai O is a 20-minute bus ride. There you can pay for a boat ride to see the pink dophins (with some luck). Walk through the small street towards the hillside and you'll find a cafe by the water where you can have a nice afternoon tea.Check the kai-to (small ferry boat) schedule. There is a 6:00 pm ferry back to Tung Chung. Enjoy the sun-set ride before having dinner in Tung Chung and finish off you day with late evening shopping."

Wisdom Path Looked Great but was a disappointment as the wordings were in local language.Best to visit when you are near the Airport as will save time in travelling. Locker Rental Facilities are available. Book your tickets for the cable car in advance or be prepared to be waiting for 30 minutes for ticketing and then about 10-20 minutes to get into the cable car.This place had the best souvenirs shops in HK. The prices are cheaper and of better qualities then those found in Temple Street/Lady's Market"

The line to get on the cable car was also very long, so I would recommend getting there as early as possible or towards the end of the day. We got in line around 10:00am, and it was around a 2 hour wait. I wouldn't bother doing any of the other \"attractions\" they offer, because as I stated, it's all just one big tourist trap surrounding the actual reason for visiting, the Buddah."

            "review": "ISLAND GREAT BUT NIGHTMARE WAIT FOR CABLE CAR. Please read carefully if you go here. If you really want to experience the long cable car ride then do it this way. Firstly you need to go very early about one hour before opening time and even then expect to wait a while. Or better still take a number 11 bus from Tung Chung mtr station to go to the Fishing Village of Tai O. You get to tung chung via the orang line from central mtr. Journey time about 30 mins and can be quite busy.the Fishing village is quaint and well worth a visit, not touristy at all as it remains as in olden days. Locals are friendly and you can sit on one of the wooden balconies overlooking the river and enjoy a cool beer or try homemade doughnuts from the local bakery. Locals are friendly and there are plenty of good toilets. Take a boat ride of about 20 to 30 mins out to see to look for the pink dolphins and even if you do not see any it is a nice trip for 20hkd.Then take bus 21 to the top of the mountain to see the Buddah etc. buses run frequently and it is nice trip of about 25 mins. If you do the trip this way round you will be the opposite to all the tour groups and you should find it quieter and easier in the heat.At the top it is all free, some karate type demos and other things to do and lots of nice shops and places to eat not to mention the fab views. the Buddah is impressive and it is free to climb the steps to get up close. At the top there is a museum and it is only a few hkd to enter. There is also a temple but it is under huge reconstruction but still worth a free visit.When you are finished you can go down by cable car at leisure and no queues usually. A single trip is about 95hkd. return is 135. Do not bother with the crystal cabin with the extra charges as there is only forest beneath you.There are various tours offered but they cost at least double what we paid and we did all plus maybe more than the tour groups at less than half the cost and we did not have to worry about meeting times etc.if however you want to travel cable car both ways and maximise your time then DO a tour as you get on the able car much much quicker. We had to queue for 2 hours and 20mins and had almost collapsed in the heart by then time our turn came. if we had been correctly advised about the waiting time we would have definitely paid the extra. there are waiting time signs but you can ignore them as they are in no way accurate. As you reach the ticket office do not get excited as you will have at least another 80 mins to wait.It is a full day out and well worth a visit though."

We waited for an hour to get out tickets. We did not buy online because we didn't know what time we would reach the station. And it was worth the wait. We took the crystal cabin and we saw a complete 360 view. Up ,down and sides. It was pricey. Check it out on their website. Pls buy to and fro tickets. The return queue was just as long. As we went higher and higher we saw the airport, jungles, mountains and also the majestic tall buildings which HK is famous for. The ride took about 20-30 min I think. And when u see the Buddha then u know you are almost reaching the top. You will be bombarded with pictures and souvenirs of pictures they took of you earlier inside the cable car.The were air islets inside the cable car which ventilated it very well. But our journey downward was hot.Just a reminder the cable car closes at 6pm. And you can get busses from the top. The big Buddha requires 200 plus steps to reach there. Once u reach there u get a bird eye view of the mountains around. But there is a small fee to go all the way inside the statue. Which is not worth it. I don't remember what I saw.We skipped on the poh Lin monastery and tea house due to time constrain. Food shops were abundant. We are at ebeneezar and the food was good. Overall u need to walk a lot and bring along water. It's expensive there. Ps- china Summer holidays start on the 1st July. You will see the highest crowd during the holiday period."

The lift with the glass bottom was more expensive but i honestly don't think its worth it because there's not much to look at besides trees and water looking down and you can already see those as the cabin moves up. Definitely suggest going to Tai O the fishing village though. Very good experience and its very different from city life so i definitely appreciated that. Don't really need to go tour or find someone to lead the way if you've done research before hand. Everything was pretty easy to get too but of course we had the leisure of not doing any research because my boyfriend's family took us there."

Once there make your way to the cable cars. It is a pleasant trip across to Lantau Island, if you can afford it , go for the glass bottom car, as you will some beautiful sites. In addition, take up the option to go to the fishing village. It is educational if you have kids for them to see how other families live. I know my daughter was very appreciative after we left. All the people in the village and on the island are friendly. We went there on a foggy day and I believe it added to the mystical nature. Climb up to see the Buddha. It has around 270 steps, but well worth it and if my 65 year old mother can do it, so can you. My only real advice ladies is to try and not shop at the great outlets before you go to the island, as it is pain to carry your shopping. Although, for the Australians you can pick up great guess handbags for half the price we pay here."

Adult ticket is about hkd 40 and for child 20. It was quite a leisurely ride on the ferry. In less than an hour we reached Lantau island.Following that we took a bus to see the Big Buddha. Cost us about hkd67 for two adults and a child. The ride on the bus is very scenic. Get to see the way of life of people on Lantau island and the beach. But be prepared it is a pretty long ride. About 45 mins before reaching the Big Buddha. The Big Buddha is our highlight for the day. Really magnificent. You can see the Buddha from a distance. It is pretty crowded at the Big Buddha and can be a bit cooling at times. Walking up to see the Big Buddha was fun. If you wish to go into the Big Buddha to see the exhibits and the highest point in the Buddha, you can get entry by just purchasing the vegetarian lunch coupon. The vegetarian lunch cost hkd78 for the basic one and about low of hkd 100 plus for the luxury version. Personally I felt in terms of food, the basic and the luxury version did not make much difference to me as I have tried both versions before. Just that the luxury one is a little bit more exclusive. Seating is a little more comfortable.The vegetarian food is eaten in the monastery. Found quite a pleasure to walk in the monastery. Find it to be peaceful. Before leaving, we had the hand grounded soy beancurd. It is very fine and nice. You can find the shop near the entrance of the monastery.We left Lantau Island by taking the Ngong Ping 360 cable car. It is a fun ride. Pretty long ride too. About hkd400 plus if I don't remember wrongly for 2 adults and 1 child."

If you pay 30 HK Dollars more you will get a car with glass floor and you'll be able to see the fantastic view under your feet : mountains and sea .It worth the money !! After some 20 minutes you will arrive to the BIG BUDDHA that is situated in a small comercial village . From there you can take a bus to a small typical fishing village called TAI O . There you will stroll in the market and have a boat tour to the sea-between the very primitive terraces surronded by water - those terraces are part of the fishermen houses. Go back to Ngong Ping Village and after visiting the Buddha take the Cable Car down.If you are looking for OUT LET Shopping there is one just before you catch the MTR back to Honk Kong.It is a all day tour that will bring you to the old, humble and original chinese living way and to spectacular views ."

You had to climb a certain amount of stairs to reach the top but when you get there, the view is breathtaking. Although it'd be hard to take decent photos because there are many tourists. If you can explore the island with the perfect weather - not so hot not so cold no rain - it'll be a hassle-free enjoyable trip.There are cheap small food stalls where you can buy Chinese foods, water, and ice drops, in case you get hungry/thirsty while walking."

The Buddha is a lovely place to visit and you get a very cheap ticket to go inside which also includes a free bottle of water and ice-cream (or some noodles at the temple site). One can't complain about the value of that. Once we were done there, we went to Tai O on the bus. Tai O is known as Hong Kong's little Venice. It is a fishing village where the locals live in stilted houses over the water. I would have liked to have spent more time there as it is interesting and has a certain charm. We had a nice relaxing boat trip for only 20 HK dollars (though we didn't get to see the famous pink dolphins). Lots more to do on Lantau Island so it is recommended by me for a good day out or even a stay-over."

By visiting Lantau Island your trip to Hongkong becomes a little different and adventurous , exciting and unforgettable . The thrill starts with riding the cable car , the crystal cabin in particular . It allows you to see what's down under ,the sea below , the mountain ranges , thick forests , trails and fantastic view of the vast airport . As you traverse and meet other cable cars , it gives you the great feeling of flying and on top of the world , conquering its awesome beauty . As you approach Lantau Island , you will see the Great Buddha and as you get nearer , you would love to take more pictures and could not wait to disembark and climb to him to get a closer look .Climbing the steps was worth it , it was a good exercise under the scorching sun and a good form of sacrifice too . Even if you belong to a different religion , you will feel the sanctity of the place and outmost respect for the people who especially visit the place out of faith .Pls bring a cap or an umbrella , towel and lots of water to hydrate you while you explore the place. Do not forget your sun glass . Trip back was via the cable car again . This time , no more picture taking but everyone was busy looking and reviewing the great pictures taken with the Great Buddha and souvenir cable photos . If you have not seen Lantau Island , you have not seen Hongkong . Go for it !"

Other than the airport, not strictly on Lantau but Ckek Lap Kok island, we made two trips to Lantau, Disney and the fantastic Skyrail, the longest cable car in the world, to the Big Buddha.Take the MRT to Tung Chung on Lantau and make the short walk on the covered raised walkway to the Skyrail station. It seems quite expensive, but this is an engineering marvel, We queued for about 15 minutes, but judging by the queuing areas, this wait must get much, much longer at busy times. It was raining with low cloud when we took the cable car. As each car arrives, workers board the car and completely clean windows, hand rails, seats and floors before new passengers enter.The cable car soars out of the cable car station and over a narrow part of the strait between Chek Lap Kok Island and Lantau, then over a wide section of water and then rises to the largest cable car pylon in the world. The views are spectacular, even in the rain. The cable car crosses Hong Kong National park, so the fewest possible pylons were allowed during construction by the Swiss company that built the Skyrail. The journey takes about 25 minutes and after clearing the 'monster pylon' the Big Buddha becomes visible as the cable car crosses the beautiful National Park. Stunning views of the airport can also be had, as we climbed an Airbus A380 came into land.Once at the end of the journey you are just a short walk from Po Lin monastery and the Big Buddha, the biggest statue of Buddha in the world. By now the sun was shining and the skies had cleared. We had planned to take the bus and ferry back to Hong Kong, but we spent so much time at Po Lin, that my wife, a lifelong cable car hater, was forced to endure the return journey by cable car, this time in beautiful sunshine with views over the stunning coastal scenery towards the South China Sea. For Disney, just get off the MRT one stop earlier than Tung Chung at Sunny Bay and take the Disneyland Resort Line, the train is in itself worth the ride, even for those not raised as Disney Babes."

Temples and monasteries are fairly commonplace in Asia, so a visit to Lantau Island initially ranked pretty low on my \"to do\" list. Boy, was I wrong. It was fortunate that I decided to go on a \"Oh, what the heck I might as well go\" impulse otherwise, I might have missed out on seeing one of the better attractions in HK.There are various ways of getting there, but the cable car appears to offer the best views (more of that in a separate attraction review). There's certainly more to Lantau Island than just the Buddha Statue and the monastery, but just visiting both of these is pretty much fair enough for a visit.It's always a good idea to pack an umbrella (in case it rains- it also doubles as a sun parasol) and sunblock. There are lots of places to eat, and in case you run out of HK$, there's a Travelex outlet in the vicinity.Toilets can be a little on the filthy side though, and I have not observed any special facilities for the mobility impaired. There are unleashed dogs wandering about the temple grounds (not strays, as they seem quite healthy) but you may want to stay clear of them, even though I've been told by locals that they've never heard of anyone being bitten."

As a religious site, Lantau has the Big Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery, both of which are worth a visit. Having said that, everywhere you turned (even in the religious sites), you were being offered things to buy, eat, etc. This was especially true in Ngong Ping Village, which is one giant shopping center. One of the best parts of the trip, is riding the cable car, a 25 minute trip over mountains and water to (or from) Tung Chung, where you can easily catch a train into the city. If you take the cable car, make sure to get one of the \"Crystal Cabins.\" Watching the scenery from the bottom of the car is pretty awesome!"

The island is well laid out & is paved with cobble stone.

It was well worth the visit though and the site is so big that there was room for all. We opted to take a bus to the monastery as the queues for the cable car were horrendous with literally thousands of people waiting. There are plenty of food outlets and shops within the monastery grounds and amazing views of the outlying islands to be had from the Big Buddha. The rest of Lantau is quiet and rural, a complete contrast to Hong Kong. There are many good photo opportunities. Whilst we were there we also visited the old fishing village of Tai O which is still relatively unspoilt. A reasonably priced boat trip took us to see the stilt houses and out onto the bay in search of dolphin. Lantau is definitely worth a visit."

We took yellow line mtr (the line to disney) from Central up to Tung Chung, the last stop less than 1hr. As it is not a sunny day, we decided to take the standard cable car at hkd 98 per person one way and went back by bus cost hkd17 per person. Would recommend the glass bottom cable car which is much more expensive, if you came in sunny day. We enjoyed the beautiful scenery at the beginning of the climb, but it was too foggy at the top we were blinded by white fog, quite spooky i would say:) the cable ride took around 15min arriving at Ngong Ping village around 11am, many souvenir shops before we came to the giant buddha entrance. Before climbing up the stairs there is a locket where you can buy vegetarian lunch ticket. As advised by my Hongkong friend, we bought the deluxe one which is more expensive at hkd118 per person. Then we climbed up as we were not hungry yet. The Giant Buddha is impressive and we also went inside where there were shops selling souvenirs which has been \"kai guang\" or prayed by monks and also shrines for the deceased. Hongkong famous artist Anita Mui's ashes was kept in the shrine here. Then we went out to take beautiful pictures then walked down Towards the Po Lin monastery which was under renovation. We went straight for the veggie lunch, and served with delicious meals consist of mushroom soup, and 4 dishes which was plentiful for the 2 of us. The return trip by bus 23 took around 30min. The bus station located in the middle of the village where you can also take bus 11 to Tai-O fisherman village if you got time. Arriving at Tung Chung we managed to shop at the factory outlets there for branded stuff before heading back :)"

The \"TIP\" is save your meal receipt and take it to the desk at the ferry terminal and you will get a free trip back! we would have had no idea if hadn't been for our relations who live there.2nd tip buy a \"Octopus\" card for all transport inc. ferries but not taxis also can be used in cafes and kiosks for snacks etc."

We did go into cloud for a few minutes, but on the whole the journey afforded great views - and I got to see some aircraft movements at HK airport (sad, but I love it!). DO NOT buy your tickets from the touts parading up and down the lines waiting for the cable car - the official tickets are sold at the head of the queue.........however convincing they appear and annoying they become! The proper tickets are not that dear anyway - in fact, the ride is damn good value.Guys, this is a cable car, and it is bloody high - don't go if you don't enjoy heights.The initial impression upon arriving at the \"top\" is good, but sadly there are a few grotty establishments that really spoil the walk to the temple and the Buddha. Plenty of places to eat and clean toilet facilities are available. The Buddha is without doubt, very impressive and well worth the effort of going to see. The temple looked a bit sorry cloaked in scaffolding, but everything has to be maintained sometime.Look out for the wandering cows too ;-)"

You can also plan to trek the entie way. Do remember to carry a good camera and you will have lots of memories to take back home. If you take the cable car go for the one with the glass floor. Although its scary initially but then its absolutely safe and a sure shot recommendation. The view of the HK airport from the cable car is absolutely mindblowing.

The prices are better than most malls, but still be prepared to spend a good bit. We took a bus to the Mui Wo Pier to meet friends for dinner. Right near the pier is a fantastic Turkish restaurant that serves some of the best Middle-Eastern food I've found in all of Asia. I unfortunately, do not remember the name, but it is right near the Deer Horn Bar - to the right if you are facing the pier/ferry. It's a must try!

So many different ways to get to, from and around Lantau Island, that some pre-planning is essential.As we visited 2 days before the cable car was due to reopen on the 21st (having been closed for maintenance) we went over by ferry from Central, took the bus up to the Monastery and Big Buddha, bus down to Tai O, then bus from there to the MTR at Tung Chung and on to Jordan MTR as a thunderstorm had come on as we were leaving Tai O. Unfortunately we definitely chose the wrong day.As we sailed into Mui Wo on the ferry, we could see clouds and mist on the higher hills. Sure enough, the more the bus climbed up, the more clouds and mist we found ourselves in. At Ngong Ping we stepped off the bus into what was more like swirling fog. You could hardly see anything. \"Big Buddha\" was lost in the fog, and we could only see the first 40 or so steps leading to it. Decided not to bother with the climb due to the poor visibility, so only had a short look around the misty area beside the Monastery before taking a bus down to Tai O. Here, all was relatively clear and we enjoyed a short HK 20pp boat trip for views of the stilted village and out to sea hoping to spot some dolphins. We saw none. We then enjoyed a walk around the village and visited the small one room museum to learn more about life in this rural fishing community.As we were walking around, we noticed the clouds were lower and darker than they had been when we arrived and decided to return to Kowloon by MTR instead of ferry. We were no sooner on the bus heading to Tung Chow MTR than the heavens opened and a thunderstorm began. The road is twisty and steep so being driven in a thunderstorm was somewhat hair raising! As the bus stop is undercover next to the MTR we were lucky and arrived back in Kowloon still dry.Despite our disappointment with the fog at the Monastery and Big Buddha, we nonetheless enjoyed the ferry trip across, the ride from Ngong Ping to Tai O, and Tai O itself. Lantau is completely different from Hong Kong and worth a visit regardless of weather."

In short, nice gondola, nice buddah, lots of tourists, one of my best walks in life down from the area back to Tung Chen on a wonderful and beautiful walktrack in the valley! Breathtaking!Took the cableway (70HKD one way) up to the Po Lin Monastery to see the Big Buddah and the rest of the temple area. The Buddah in itself was very impressing, but almost found it greater from a little distance. Spent in total maybe 20 minutes on the Buddah and 20 minutes looking around the monastery sight. The view from the area was very nice, even though I visited on a cloudy day. DO NOT miss out on the \"not much spoken about\" Lantau trail back to Tung Chen. Had decided to ge already before going on the cablewal, so did not buy return ticket. Lady in ticket office tried to get me to change my mind, \"it will take you four five hours to walk down, very bad road\". I decided to anyway since I had a lot of time free. This ended up being the very best thing in the whole day, maybe even for a very long time. About 7k walk, took me two hours including plenty of stops for photographing the hidden away monasterys on the way down the montainside in the valley. Much more worth seeing than the Po Lin manastery, much more real. The walkway was nicely prepared and not hard to walk down, where it was steep there was always built in steps. Bring plenty of water though, and maybe some fruit. Went through rainforest, mountainside and valley, with beautiful views, smells and a sense of total calm. Hearing the monks singing when walking through the rainforest was absolutely amazing! In total I met three budist monks and one brave person walking UP the montain, this in my whole two hours of walking. To get to the Lantau trail (signs to Tung Chen and another village before), just follow the way to the Tee Garden/Hostel/Wisdom Path."

On my most recent trip, I found the once empty road built out with a small village ( if you have been to Aspen, Northstar at tahoe, Squaw Valley USA- that kind of village) complete with Starbucks. Walk through the village and then enter the original establishment - the monastery. The monks are gracious and generous to all their tourists. The scenery is beautiful. It is a working monastery, remember to be respectful. Eat at the monastery. It is the best vegetarian food you will eat and the sale benefits the monastery. Plan to spend several hours there. Your hotel room isn't ready yet anyway. The views are incredible. The museum inside the big buhdha complex holds treasures from ancient history and from recent years. The stairs- be ready for the massive amount of stairs required. There is no other way up ( at least the last time i went). It is an awesome spiritual place, even for this Catholic girl."

This gave us clear views over the sea one moment and ghostly images of cables and cars vanishing into or emerging out of grey nothingness the next. About two thirds of the way into the ride we broke through cloud level and were rewarded with spectacular views over the hills and, towards the end, of the Big Buddha itself.The Buddha site and surrounding buildings is something of a curiosity. It began from a visit of Chinese monks to India on which they were impressed by the Indian traditions and wanted to bring something of that back to Hong Kong. On the other hand the site is clearly focused on drawing in tourist revenue and attracts the usual selection of reasonable shops and cheap stands. At the top of the climb the site of the statue is magnificent. Looking out on the remnants of mist folding over the ridges leading to the nearby sunlit hills I was unavoidably (cliche alert) reminded of vistas from Peter Jackson's Tolkein films. But in a good way. Visitors included both tourists and adherents which struck me as a little odd until I thought about the crowds around, for example, Notre Dame in Paris where the faithful mingle with the casual visitors and realised it was just the same and I was experiencing the shock of the familiar. The monastery below the statue is a classic Chinese temple with the incense burners and braziers and the statues of Buddha and the Bodishatvas protected by the staties of Temple guardians. Again, there was no shortage of adherents burning incense, paying their respects and leaving snall offerings. At the time this seemed to me to sit oddly with the tourist focus of the surrounding village although I have since learned more about the ways in which Buddhism in China has both survived and enjoyed something of a resurgence since the cultural revolution.My initial thought was that the historical Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama Buddha would have been horrified by the commercialisation of it all but I later decided that the Chinese tradition probably has it right - he would have found it hilarious. Well worth a visit if you have the time and a nice way to escape the hustle and bustle of central Hong Kong."

One can hike this trail in about 3 to 4 hours over hilly terrain to reach the Ngong Village area and from there it is a 10 minute walk to the big Buddha."

If you find yourself getting tired of the semi-controlled insanity that is downtown Hong Kong, a day trip to Lantau Island may be what's called for.Populated mostly by quite fishing villages, Lantau can be reached by the MTR or by ferry boat from Central Pier. Once on the island, there are plenty of ways to spend the day, from hiking in the mountains to fishing to just relaxing in one of the villages. There are also several beaches along the southern coast of the island which make for a great day trip. Furthermore, consider a trip up to the Big Buddha along with a vegetarian lunch at the monastery there. Disneyland Hong Kong is also located on Lantau if you need to shut the kids up for a day. It can be reached by train from Sunny Bay on its own dedicated MTR line."

And because we haven't had lunch yet, we actually bought from the vendors in the area. Corn was at HK$ 10. Pricey for a quick snack but it was alright. Even tried the chicken leg. We also liked the monastery with all the incense and offerings outside. We didn't get to check out the village but we will surely come back.

Note the giant bronze buddha on the way, a mere 37m tall. When you get to Ngong Ping, have a coffee and check out the buddha before catching a bus to the other end of the island at Tai O. When a dodgy bloke comes up to you offering you a boat ride, take it. For less than \u00a32 per person, the boat takes you past the old fishing houses built on sticks, or rather twigs, before turning around and zooming out to sea. We were all flying around like T shirts in a washing machine. Great fun. When we stopped in the middle of nowhere we were delighted by 4 pink dolphins leaping out of the sea.Once safely back in Tai O bus terminus, catch the bus to Mui Wo, 50 mins. Have a nice swim on the beach before catching the ferry back to the madness of Hong Kong"

You can also hike up the mountain on trails just below the cable car. Long way. When you reach the Big Buddha it is just lovely. The sheer size is striking and the surroundings are beautiful gardens that are immaculate and full of flowers. The temple near-by is lovely and you will have a vegetarian lunch prepared by the monks in a restaurant like area. It was really good even though I am not a vegetarian. The atmosphere is quiet and serene and a nice change from the bustle of HK. There is a small shop area with food, souveniers and other items for sale. Cobbled street.

I'm not sure if it was by coincidence or by design, but just as we arrived there was a bus about to leave for Tai O village, so we jumped aboard and enjoyed a pleasant ride from one side of the island to the other. Tai O is actually a small island, separated from the main island of Lantau by a very narrow channel, which is easily crossed by a footbridge near to the bus terminus. It's a fascinating mixture of a traditional waterfront fishing village with stilt-houses and modern high-rise apartment blocks set back from the seafront. We spent some time wandering the village streets with their fascinating shops and looking at the fishing boats in the harbour before making our way back to the bus station - only to find that we'd just missed the hourly bus to Ngong Ping by about 2 minutes! However, there's a taxi rank next to the bus stop and when the first driver informed us that it would only cost $48HK to take us there, we decided that was a far better option than hanging around for another hour and risking missing the next one!The entrance to Ngong Ping consists mainly of a modern shopping street, aimed squarely at selling various souvenirs to the tourists. The most fascinating shop for us is the Chopstick Gallery, where you can choose from literally hundreds of different designs and for the second year running, we came away with a beautiful set of chopsticks packed in an equally lovely gift box! In addition to the main attraction of the Big Buddha, there are country walks around the peaks, but as a chilly mist was starting to roll in we decided to call it a day and head back down by cable car. The views from the cars are fantastic, not least being the one as you come over the last peak and get a wonderful view of the airport with planes taking off and landing far below you. At the bottom, there's a good shopping mall next to the MTR station if you're not already shopped out, then a final form of transport - the MTR - took us back to our hotel. An excellent day out all round!"

Apparently if you book online you don't have to wait in the queue. The Buddha is huge. He is sitting on top of a series of stairs and the lead up is a walkway of statues that explain each of the Chinese years ... we each had our photo with our Chinese animal! The surroundings are well kept and very interesting. There are lots of challenging walks that you can do but they would definitely take a long time. We went for about 4 hours and walked out to the Wisdom Path ... this was an amazing series of huge carved wooden poles. It was easy to access and very peaceful. There is so much that you can do on Lantau Island that a day trip would be very full. It really is a place with something for everyone."

The other bonus of going with a tour is that you don't queue for the cable car, and it doesn't matter if you go on the weekend or during the week there is always a long queue, so if you go on your own be prepared to wait in line. I had lunch at the monestary which is vegetarian and very tasty, the village itself has great shopping and of course the Big Buddha touches your soul. If you do nothing else whilst you are in Hong Kong this is an absolute must do."

The Cable car ride is amazing - and seems to follow the old priests path to the Budda. If its a cool day take a coat as the cable car has open mesh panels and the wind whistles in. Go through the village (just a few tourist shops really and expensive) and climb up to the Budda. Don't be tempted by the offer of a snack or meal ticket to the second levels - they are only another 10 feet higher and it doesn't give you any better views. Also there is a vegetarian deli cafe behind the monks dining hall which serves exactly the same food as you would get in the monks dining hall but cheaper - and the portions are huge. The temple was being restored when we went last week - so we only saw the first two outer courtyards. Next we took the bus down to Tai O to see the stilt houses - very interesting - the tide was out. Then we took the bus back to Tung Chung and saw all the beautiful beaches and new apartments going up. A very nice day out"

It is just that - built for tourists. Enjoy the ride, but don't expect a wonderful cultural experience! A few tips:1. Adjust your expectations that this is a fun ride and the town on top of the hill is a tourist destination - with Starbucks, Subway etc..2. Go on a clear day. The view is the biggest drawcard.3. Get there early. We went early and headed back a little before 1pm, the line was looooonnngg - having now visited I am sure those at the end wouldn't have felt the wait was worth it.4. If the line is long, pay the additional 200HKD (about $20) for the full tour and you go straight to the front of the line.

On my recent travel there, I was surprised on how much commercialized it got, complete with a Starbucks, Subway and Ebeneezer's ( nice kababs ). Where else can you spot a buddhist monk grabbing a latte? Seriously, I did see that. The Ngong Ping cable car is a nice addition and enjoyed the trip. My suggestion is book in advance and take the standard cable car there and the clear bottom back. I went on a saturday around 12pm and had at least 45-60 min wait. The clear bottom was nothing to brag about, but will cut the trip back significantly because of the wait for the standard car. The Big Buddha is a beautiful site. I was lucky to visit on a clear day and received sensational views of the surrounding island. The Po Lin Monastery was interesting to visit. You will get a mix of people actually coming to pray and foreigners pointing at things. I enjoyed the vegetarian meal and would skip the fare in the faux-village.

Please buy your tickets early as the queue was about an hour +. The experience is nice and the place is quiet compared to downtown Hong Kong. Walking towards the Buddha can be fun but not recommended for people with health problems mainly heart problems. It is a 200+ steps before you will reach the buddha statue.Still a great view from below!"

On the bus, it was interesting to see the older properties and things like the great dam and reservoir, the 'nuts and bolts' of living on an island, and the extraordinary engineering feats that keep the hillsides stable. It felt like one was seeing Hong Kong as it might have been sixty years ago. On the whole, it was - okay."

Take an easy metro ride to Tung Chung station, walk over to the cable car and treat yourself to a glass bottomed cable car ride to Po Lin monastery. The cable car ride takes about 25 minutes and gives some amazing views during the trip. The small village at the top is fairly touristy, but walk through it to the Giant Buddha and the monastery. When we visited the monastery was undergoing some repairs/extensions so a lot of it was undercover but the restaurant and outdoor bakery were open and well visited. Our cable car ticket included a bus ride down to Tai O, a fishing village, and a boat ride around the village houses which were all on stilts and above the water. It was eye-opening as to how they live. We caught the bus ride back to the monastery and the cable car back down the mountain. I didn't feel 100% comfortable at Tai O, can't put my finger on exactly why. As far as the cable car and a visit to the Buddha, it's highly recommended."

The journey above sea, mountains and jungle is amazing and can be enjoyed more from a crystal cabin (the car with glass bottom). Superb view of Hong Kong Airport (which also lies on same island) and building can be see thru rope way trolley.After reaching on the top one can visit statue of Giant Buddha, temple and monastery. Very soothing and peaceful place. A visit to see fishing Village of Tai-O can be done from here to see the Pink Dolphins. Don\u2019t take full package of NGong Ping and choose selectively instead because all is not worth. Show of short movies etc can be easily skipped from the tour.Overall Lantau island is a one of the must place to visit in Hong Kong. Depends on preference, one can choose destination to travel here."

Some may classify this place as a tourist trap, but the views up here are absolutely stunning, and seeing the Big Buddha in person is mighty impressive. There's also many neat monuments along the way for picture opportunities. I came here in early September 2012, so needless to say, it was scorching hot when I was here. If you do visit around this time, make sure you have sun block or at least wear a hat and sun glasses. The entire path leading up to the Big Buddha is out in the open, so you will have little to no shade. From the path of the cable car exit to the top of the Big Buddha, the walk can be quite exhausting if you're not in shape. Keep in mind that there is a lot of walking, specifically going up a lot of stairs. But nonetheless, if you feel like walking up all those stairs is too much, you don't necessarily have to go up. There's plenty of sight seeing, picture taking, eating and shopping you can do as well. There's little gift shops along the way, as well as local street food and restaurants. There was this one tented place where they served steamed milk and steamed egg. It was cheap and delicious! Great spot to hang out a bit before heading back to the exit. Getting here, I basically took the metro all the way to Lantau Island / DIsneyland. Once arriving, its pretty self explanatory which way to go. We ended up getting in the long line for the cable car. The cable ride was definitely a great way to get to the \"Big Buddha\" location. You'll get a scenic view along the entire ride. If you opt for a glass floor on the cable car, you'll have to pay a little more. Other neat things were along the cable ride, if you look down beneath you, you'll see people hiking all the way up to the same area. And on the way back down, you'll see planes taking off from the HK Airport. Plan a day trip if you do come. For the time vs money spent here, its quite a nice value. I highly recommend it."

I suggest you should be there before 10AM. we were there at 9:30 but they already allowed us to take the ride since it is a Saturday so the queu is quite long. If you're there before 10 AM, u can leave Lantau early and proceed to your next activity. At lantau, there is Po Lin Monastery and the Buddha. make sure to go to the Buddha first (admission HK $28) but includes free meal. noodles and 2 kinds of pastry with a drink(coffee or juice). You can avail the meal at the Po lin monastery. Afterwards you can enjoy ocean park =)"

We took the journey starting from Wan Chai area in Causeway bay. First we took a boat trip crossing from Wan Chai to Mui Wo harbor in Lantau island. The boat harbor was adjacent to bus station so you just step in to the bus route to Ngong Ping (the Big Buddha). Along the trip was an uphill journey, you can see houses and how people of Lantau live and also see scenery of the bay from the height. Arriving in Ngong Ping, you can climb the stairs to the Big Buddha.After climbing the Big Buddha we took the cable car going down. As it was n December, it was full of mist and brought big sensation going down as you couldnt see the end of the cable. Our kids were thrilling and screaming but we enjoyed it. At the end of the cable station we took taxi to Disneyland. It is recommended to go to Disneyland in late afternoon as so can stay there until closing at 8 pm and you can see the great fireworks at the end of the day. The day was fully adventurous for us and very memorable. I highly recommend this route to everyone :)"

Check out the monastery, while I was there a ceremony was going on, which was interesting enough, not over the top impressive but still interesting to watch. Burning incense and offerings are made and its great to get involved.

First up the cable car ride across to the island is pretty spectacular, you have the option of getting a 'crystal cabin' which has clear floor so you can see directly beneath you. Be warned though, lines can be massive (not sure if we went on a particularly busy day) but we waited in line for well over an hour to get on a cable car. The only other alternative way of getting there that I know of is by bus, which takes about an hour.My tip would be to buy your tickets online prior to getting there. There is a separate queue for online tickets which was not busy at all and I wish we had done that. Or take up a package when you get there, I'm fairly sure they fast-track you to the ticket counter instead of lining up. Otherwise come later in the afternoon when there is hardly anyone going across to the island. The Lantau Village which is where the cable car takes you is a replica village at the base of the big Buddha and is a bit of a tourist trap in reality, but a good spot to get something to eat/drink when you get there. The big Buddha itself is incredibly impressive and quite a site especially from the base/coming in from the cable car."

At first, about how to get there: you are to take the Tung Chung (orange) metro line and take off on the Tung Chung station (it's the last station of the line - you won't miss it). Then, according to the signs find the \"Cable Car\". The prices are: Standard cabin ticket: 140$/95$ (adult/child), Crystal cabin ticket: 180$/140$ . Strongly advise you not to waist your money if it's cloudy up there - you won't see anything. Much better to take the bus (it's only 35$ for the Lantau day pass for unlimited rides on all regular routes of New Lantao buses).About the trip: it's really great place to go, you need a plenty of time to explore it - and a good weather to help you. Giant Buddha is the one Buddha facing the East - the other monuments face The West. So, it doesn't have a lot in itself - let's speak about the scenery. It's very beautiful up there if there is no wind blowing your face and trying to drop you down - and the rain making all your clothes wet and cold :) such a great challenge for your health. Have a walk to the Wisdom Path - it's magically picturesque there. Don't hesitate and go to the Lantau island. And a tip for non-vegetarian people - don't even try you stomach to eat this vegetarian dinner or lunch, sorry - it's a waist of money.it's much better to eat in the village - there is even Starbacks - don't worry you won't be hungry."

Visiting the town, for me it is not worth it, it is completely focused for tourists and you can even find an Starbucks. The Buddha is amazing and I would definitely recommend to go upstairs as it is only 10 minutes walking. To go down and back to the airport we took the telespheric. Not the glass floor which is a little bit more expensive, but the normal one. The journey was about 25 minutes and then we took a taxi which costed about 3\u20ac to go back home."

There are two types of ferries one is the slow one (1 hour) and the fast one (30 mins). The price is the same. I enjoyed the ferry ride a lot. On Lantau Island as we got out of the ferry, the bus station was right there. We took the bus up to the Monastery and the Big Buddha. The bus ride was also something like an hour. The Island is beautiful, it is so green and peaceful cows are all around. Finally we arrived there (it is the last stop so you do not really have to worry about getting off). We first went to the Monastery and had lunch there. They had a very nice vegetarian menu with tea, soup, rice, tofu, vegetables and spring rolls (for HKD 70 per person). If you save your receipt, you get later a free entry to the museum up at the Buddha. The monastery was under renovation in November 2012 so we did not spend much time there, we rather climbed up on the stairs to see the Buddha. It is a tough walk up, but not extremely hard, I expected something much worse (as I had a knee problem). There are also many stairheads between the staircases where you can rest if you have to. There is also a massive handrail on all the way up and down so the whole thing is very safe. The Buddha is breathtaking. As we climbed up, we found ourselves in the middle of a cloud, which was also fantastic. After visiting the Big Buddha, we took the cable car. Honestly, I had some hidden thoughts about taking the cable car before, but it was just great. Cabins were safe and clean, the view was amazing. The cable car landed at a metro station, so it was very easy to get to home after this adventure. I do recommend visiting Lantau Island, the Buddha and the Monastery."

So we left our SkyCity Marriott for Tung Chung via the provided shuttle bus. After breakfast there, we took service 3M heading for Mui Wo. We had planned to stop at Nam Shan to walk a small bit of the South Lantau Country Trail. Without fail, we missed the bus stop and ended up at the Mui Wo Ferry Pier. It was a mistake we did not regret. Mui Wo is rather scenic even though the day was dreary and threatened to rain and it did.We have come prepared and all of us have our rain jackets. This apparently became useless because Lantau has higher humidity and the jackets made us overheat badly. Good thing we have umbrellas!We then walked back on the South Lantau Road (uphill!) back to Nam Shan. It was tiring but we made it. The mists covered the hilltops of Lantau lending it the same \"sea of clouds\" phenomenon we see in Taiwan's Nantou region, in particular the Cingjing area. Nam Shan campsite has toilets and even vending machines which accepted Octopus cards. A welcome for the exhausted children who are energized and motivated with the sweet drinks. We then trekked up to the helipad of the South Lantau Country Trail and that is as far as we went.We then returned to Mui Wo via the Old Village Path (fortunately downhill). The path was made of stone blocks and due to the rain, became slippery. We were careful and made it to Luk Tei Tong Tsuen. It is the first time we saw a real Hong Kong village. It is rather modern with brick and mortar buildings. Tiled on the outside too! There are lots of cattle in this area and we threaded carefully to avoid the cow poo. Surprisingly the poo were also on the Old Village Path which made you wonder if the cattle walked used the path as well.We boarded 3M again and headed back to Tung Chung. It was quite an adventure for our young children and they would gladly do it again."

We bought tickets in as \"crystal cabin\" gondola (glass bottom) for the ride to the top. Weather was rather cloudy and windy but we had a nice view going up.Once we got there it was a huge dissapointment. They take pictures of you when you get on the gondola and try to sell them to you at the top like some cheap amusement ride. Ngong Ping village is a travesty. Subway and lots of other chain restaurants line the walkway to the Big Buddha and the Monestary. Horribly touristy with all sorts of cheap attractions. Then we hiked up to the Buddha, which was beautiful and grand. That;s when I found the construction pictures inside... the whole thing was built around 1986! I really thought this was an ancient statue, but that's on me for not doing my research.Overall the whole experience was rather comical as we laughed our butts off after realiizing how new this statue was. The Monestary was nice. HOWEVER... this is NOT worth goign to see. Absolute waste of time as you can see many nice small monestaries in HK. Don't waste a day, unless you like outlet malls, tacky souveniers, etc... blah."

The Monkey Tale show is not worth it, if you are just paying for the ticket. It is a cartoon. In terms of cost, we got the package for 140 HKD/pp which included a one-way cable car ride, a snack in the village, the monkey tale show, bus pass and short boat tour in Tai O.

Walked to the Ngong Ping 360 Cable car station (2 min walk). Cable costs HK$125 each, for a round trip. Caution as a man was trying to sell cable car tickets for HK$100 each, just as you exit the train. His tix looked nothing like the tix we bought at the cable car station. So not sure if it was genuine or a scam. Buying a tix for the cable car took a while as at each counter they were trying to convince people to buy a package deal. (Cable car, boat trip & fishing village). We chose to go on a normal cable car (crystal cabin costs a bit more), but no thanks. Normal car was enough excitement for us. Impressed as no clunk clunk as you go over the towers. So smooth. Its a lovely scenic ride on the cable car. You can see the airport from above. Lots of natural bush land below you. Then you get your 1st site of the Big Buddha. When you reach the end, you walk through a souvenir shop and they have made up the photo they took of you as you got onto the cable car. We opted for the photo of us on a keyring. Other options available. You don\u2019t have to buy, if you don\u2019t want, but they do hassle you a bit to buy. Lots of souvenir shops line the path to the Big Buddha, and a few restaurants. They even had a subway food outlet there. Opted not to walk the 200+ plus steps up to the Buddha. The view was great from the bottom. Walked around to the monestary. Back to the cable car for the trip back to Ngong Ping village. Wanted to go to the City Gate brand outlets mall which is near the Cable Car Station. This place is shoppers heaven for brand named goods at cheap cheap prices."

We visited the Grand Buddha and the monastery which I find worth a visit, but we lost hours in queues for the cable car, even while it was a Monday.Tips to limit your queueing time:Book your tickets in advance via the internet: there is a separate line for pre booked tickets and while we were queueing, there was absolutely no queue for the pre booked tickets: people with pre booked tickets were able to walk through.If you haven't pre booked your tickets, go early (between 9 and 10 am)If you can afford it, buy Crystal bottom tickets: on the way back everyone already has a ticket and is treated equally, but the queue for Crystal tickets is about a fifth of the normal queue. The glass bottom does not really add much to the experience - I only recommend it to cut back waiting times.We had the deluxe vegetarian meal in the monastery (HKD 120), which was excellent. We had five different dishes and ate outside in the shade. The larger your company, the more different dishes you will be served.There is also a standard meal that will be served in the indoors restaurant (HKD 70)The village that you will have to walk through to go to the monastery and Buddha is horrible: blaring music and all kinds of show activities that do not really with the religious character of the site."

Whilst this used to be the fun and easy way it is now a nightmare with 1 1/2 to 2 hour queues at the cable car. The best way to do this, a little longer, but certainly more enjoyable is to do the trip from the other end as it were. Simply take a ferry to Mui Wo on Lantau from Central, the number 6 ferry. Easy as jumping on a train, though you might want to check the timetable all on the web. Waiting for you at the arrival plaza is a bus to Nong Ping where the big Buddha is. The bus terminal is the furthest to the left. You will need cash or an Octopus card - around HK$18. It is a 30 mins journey through spectacular countryside. After doing the Buddha just jump on the cable car (near where the bus dropped you!) in the reverse direction, go to Tung Chung and MTR back to your hotel. The real pleasure is seeing the huge queues at the Tung Chung end trying to get on that cable car and knowing you just walked on at the other end. Make sure you only buy a one way ticket!! BTW the factory outlets at Tung Chung are a con job. Don't waste your time."

Of all the incredible history, culture and personalities that inhabit this part of the world, Lantau's Big Buddha and said 'town' offer none of it, but an easy way to separate novice travelers from their money."

Travelling up with the cable car is a great adventure, surely for the kids, but also for the parents when it is somewhat windy. Consider taking the extra cost for the Crystal floor, the view is great and the queue is a lot shorter. When you get to the top, the \"traditional village\" is nothing more than a commercial centre. The shows are OK, but if you are limited in time, they should be the first you should skip. Walking to the monastery is worth the trip and when you really have got the courage climb to the giant Budha. The statue is even more impressive from close by and the view is great. Jump on the bus and experience the thrills when the driver races down the mountain, just know they do that all the time and hope the brakes are in good shape. Tai O fishing village is a mix of traditional and touristic, but in fact it is one of the single ways to make a living for those people. We did not see the dolphins, but the boat trip was also firn without them. Have a good meal in one of the local restaurants and return by bus to the ferry terminal or the MTR station. Particularly around closing time of the cable car this is a good idea as the queues at the top station are very long at that time. The Sea-Air-Land day pass offers an interesting program and is easy to use, but we had the feeling it was more expensive then when you would buy all elements separately (but then you must be a bit more organised yourselves)"

As we weren't staying at a hotel on the pick up list, got up early to get to a hotel for 8am pickup. Ended up transferring to another bus after pick and circling around for and hour and a half before we ended up at the pier, just a short bus trip from our hotel. So if you are staying on Hong Kong Island, meet at Central Pier. The tour was too fast and not enough time to spend at the Giant Buddha and lunch with the monks (only saw one!) Lunch was rushed so we could get to the cable car in time to leave. The Cable Car ride was amazing and if you are okay with heights pay the extra for the glass floor one. Visit to a local fishing village included and this was an eye opener. Local guide was terrific. Extra hour at the Giant Buddha would have been appreciated."

After you get off the mtr you should follow the signs to the cable car. \u00c4\u00b0t is very easy to find. Cable car is really amazing. Get a crystal cabin. The view is great since the bottom is glass also. Though in the begining you feel like falling down but the you get used to it. There was a veeery long que on the cable car. \u00c4\u00b0 didnt want to wait that long. So i took a bus (no11) and went to Tai O first which is a small village. \u00c4\u00b0t smells like fish bait because there are lots of dried fishes. There you should take a boat ride to see the stilt houses which is interesting. The ride is 20Hkd for 20 minutes. 1 hour is enough for the village. Then i took bus no 21 to Ngong Ping village. Big budda and the po lin monastry is very nice and impressive. \u00c4\u00b0 can not say same things for the Ngong Ping village. \u00c4\u00b0t is very artificial and veeeryy touristic. So i passed the village quickly. And reached the cable car. There i understood that i did the right thing not to take the cable car in the morning because there was no one at the que. \u00c4\u00b0 bought my ticket and get on the cable car within 5 minutes max. After the cable car i went to Citygate Outlet and did some shopping. Outlet was also nice. Then went back to central by mtr again. Conclusion: Cable car, po lin monastry and big budda you must see definetelyCitygate outlet and tai o village you should see. Ngong ping sucks. You fell like you arrived Disneyland but no Mickey and no fun at all"

The ferry takes the traveller from Pier3 Central to the newly refurbished ferry station in Discovery Bay. From here walk across to the Plaza- there are good shops, bars and restaurants here. Colouful plants and flowers line the way. Everywhere is pristine and attractive. For a bigger shopping experience buses run through the tunnel to Teung Cheung. From here it is easy to catch the cable car up to the Big Buddha but do go early as the queues for the cable car are long to say the least. Climb the steps to the platform below the feet of Buddha. The view is well worth the steep climb! The temple close by is impressive as well. We ate our picnic in a peaceful area shaded by trees. Allow a full day for this as there are also some interesting tourist shops on the way back to the cable car.There are plenty of footpaths on Lantau to attract walkers and a Disneyland which lights the sky with fireworks each evening. A vast contrast to Hong Kong island."

Amazing view on the hills and airport! What you need to see is not only the impressive statue of Tian Tan Buddha but also Po Lin Monastery located nerby (at the moment being renowated). If you have more time, go to the bus station (a few minutes walk down from the statue) and take the bus to Tai O (fishing town). Its stilt houses give an impression as if the time has stopped there many years ago. From Tai O you can take a bus directly to the subway station.

Something that I particularly enjoyed about the island was visiting Tai Po (fishing village) and one of the beaches. This really gave me a sense of the daily life in Lantau, which I always like to witness. Sure the base of the Buddha is laden with various shops and vendors, but you can take something beautiful away from your visit if you take time out to walk around a bit and appreciate the natural beauty of the island..And of course, the glass bottom cable car ride back down the mountain is quite the experience!

We took the ferry from Central over to Lantau - it's a really pleasant 50 minute journey over and you can take some fantastic photos from the boat of Hong Kong Island. If you have an Octopus card you can use that on the ferry rather than paying for a separate ticket.When we got to the island we got the number 1 bus to Tai-O. Most people tend to head straight for the Big Buddha so we found going to Tai-O meant that there were less queues. The bus ride takes about 35 minutes.Tai-O is a traditional market town and well worth a visit. You only need to spend a couple of hours here though. Most of the houses are on stilts and make great pictures. The market is known for its fish (dry and live) and there are a few stalls that sell really nice looking street food. There are a couple of temples that you can walk to but they're not spectacular so you wouldn't be missing anything too much.It's worth taking a walk along the water and seeing the metal houses - they're quite strange and most of the time the doors are open so you can have a quick peek inside.Near the start of the market are a series of little waterside bars - after you've done your sightseeing and are waiting for your bus it's worth having a beer or a tea in one. It's a nice way to spend half an hour.We then took the number 21 bus over to the Big Buddha which is great. The photo opportunities are fabulous. You only need to buy the $28 dollar snack package (rather than the full VIP food package).The museum is next to pointless unless you can read Mandarin but there are some nice little gift shops.The Monestary is very impressive and worth spending some time in there.The food you get with the $28 dollar package is surprisingly good - a decent sized and tasty portion of noodels and your choice of accompaniment such as spring rolls.From the Big Buddha we took the cable car over to Tung Chung MTR. It's a fantastic ride, although very high so if you suffer from vertigo you might want to avoid it. The views are fantastic, remember to look back and take a picture of the Buddha. You go really high and get great views of the airport - even planes taking off and landing.The ride lasts about 20 minutes. The train takes you all the way back to Kowloon or Central so you have a great round trip."

It was a little crowded the day we went but it was okay because there was plenty to see so the lines werent terrible. The views from the tram are unbelievable. The only downside, is the tram is known to have mechanical issues so it occasionally closes to repairs. If you are planning on riding the tram, make sure it is running before you head out on your trip."

There's also a deluxe meal for about 100 or 110 HK dollars but the basic meal is huge & tasty.These places can get really crowded so try to get there early. If you want to escape the crowds the Nei Lak Shan country trail is a short (5.7km) circular walk that starts near the Tea Garden.

We were driven from Kowloon city centre area past the cargo shipping terminal with the guide pointing out all the points of interest and statistics of the area, he was well informed and past his knowledge on to us, narrating all the time with interesting infmormation of the country side we were travelling through, we crossed over to the island on a bridge.We were taken to the Nkong Ping cable car terminal and one has the option of travelling in a standard cabin or for $100 HK dollars extra ( aprox $12AU extra you can travel in a crystal cabin which has a clear glass floor) which we did the extra being well worth it. You travel for 5.7km and offers visitors a spectacular 360degree panoramic views, including in the scenery, Hong Kong International Airport, Lantau National Park and the Giant Budda, we were on the cable car for aprox just over half an hour. From the terminal the other end we then went to Po Lin Monastery \"Budist Kingdom of the South\"this site is a pilgrimage visited by Buddist from all over the world.From there we were driven up the hill in the bus,\"one can take the 100 odd steps up to the Budda \" but we opted for the bus we were travelling on, here it parks in the car park and one only has to negotiate aprox 15 steps. There are 3 floors beneath the Budda The Hall of Universe, The Hall of Benevolent Merit and the Hall of remembrance.inside is a relic of Saykyamuni,consiting of some of his alledged cremated remains. Then from there we went on to Tai O fishing village, also known as the venice of the east,seeing the village's stilt houses on the water front,showing the striking contrast with the modern city, while at this village we walked through the dried fish market, which had very strong smells as one can imagine, but very interesting.During the whole tour there plenty of bathroom facilities and option to buy drinks and food.. From there we were taken back to our Hotel which took aprox an hour due to peak traffic in Hong Kong, a great day enjoyed"

The rail car is worth the money fantastic view of the area and the airport. Not that keen on the tourist trap shops you have to pass through to get to it. If you can use someone other than Grayline, their drivers are the pits."

On arriving, it was a short walk from the station where there are shops and a good post office (will understand English request for stamps!) to the queue for Ngong Ping 360 cable car.As mentioned in other reviews, there are two queues - one for those who have bought tickets and one for those with tickets. There are also another two queues though, one for the clear bottom cars and one for the normal bottom cars. The clear bottom (Crystal cars) queue ran much quicker so it was well worth the extra price. You get your photo taken when entering the car so be ready! We got ours done on the way down and it was luckily very soft focus so purchased it in the form of a snow globe. You can get keyrings and various trinkets with your photo on at the shop at the bottom and the top.There is a good variety of souvenir shops and a Starbucks in the shopping complex near the Buddha. I found very good quality gifts here and at much more reasonable prices than in the town. There is also a lovely tea shop selling traditional tea sets at very reasonable prices. I bought a dragon set at a fraction of the price I had seen similar sets on the main Island. Hubby walked up and around the Buddha whilst I went shopping and recovered from the cable car trip (I'm not great with heights and the car goes very very very high!).It's great to watch the planes take off at the airport below from the cable car. There's so much to see here so allow an afternoon or morning for your trip and if you don't fancy the cable car, you can get a tour bus / bus up on the land side"

Getting tickets was a confusing process as there were 2 queue, 1 that seemed to be for people with tickets and the other for people who did not seem to have tickets yet. We joined the queue at the ticket office but were then offered tickets by a staff member. The cable car offers magnificent views over Hong Kong and surrounds. The Buddha is majestic, looking out over the highest point. For visitors who have not been to a temple, the Buddhist monastery offers a chance to go and look, although this one does not have the beautiful gardens one often sees at temples."

Mui Wo is well worth a wander around and there are many walks out from the town into rural Lantau where the scenery is beautiful and you can see fields being farmed and buffalos. A stroll along the promenade by the beach is lovely and if you carry on to the pagoda there are splendid views.If you wish to go to Po Lin monastry where the Buddha is then get the bus from opposite the ferry terminal. There is a regular bus and an air conditioned bus, i suggest the former as the driver has to turn the air con off to get up the hills anyway. There are many walks over this side of the island so do check them out, i remember there were some good ones from Pui O which the bus passes through. Certainly a day on the island is worth while."

We took the subway from downtown Hong Kong (Kowloon) and it wasn't difficult. I think just one change of subways. Inexpensive, too. The view from the cable car was spectacular. At the top there was an area where there were periodic demonstrations - the day we were there it was of martial arts. Lots of shopping and food stores. Then you pass an outdoor 'market' on your way to the Buddha. He is impressive. You can walk up the steps (lots of them!) and go around the platform he's seated on. You can't really see him from the platform though. We didn't go inside the building at the top, but apparently would have learned some interesting information if we had.

Had a few spare hours on the last day of a business trip and decided to do something I had not done before and took a ferry to Lantau Island to go and see the Big Buddha.Advice from hotel was to catch the train to Tung Chungon Lantau but I wanted the ferry experience one way. Advice was to catch train to central and walk to Star Ferry Pier. I forgot to ask which exit so that was first delay. Got there in the end but as I was time challenged a taxi would have been a better option for me.The ferry trip was great and it was good to get out of the city and the hustle and bustle and get a different perspective of Hong Kong. There were some birds that joined the trip and flew along behind the ferry diving for fish. Once I got to Lantau Island another flaw in my lack of information was that I did not know I had to catch a bus to Tung Chung to get to the cable car and there was no information at the terminal to give you this advice. I walked to the Silvermine Resort which was pleasant but wasted more precious time only to be told about the buses. Back I walked.There was a taxi waiting at the taxi stand back at the pier so for $135HK I got the driver to take me to the Big Budhha. The taxi driver was very nice and gave me some information on the drive that I enjoyed.The island has a very relaxed feel and there is still evidence of a traditional life. The Big Buddha was great and very pleased I made the effort to go. Caught the cable car back to Tung Chung and then the train with just enough time to pack and get back to Lantau by other means to fly home.A recommended trip if you have a few days in HK and more time than me to enjoy the experience at your leisure"

Next we took the cable car up to the Big Buddha and Po Lin Monasteries. When we were finished there, we could have taken the #21 bus to Tai O fishing village but the wait would have been 45 minutes. Instead our family of 8 took 2 cab rides down that took about 15 minutes. Upon arrival in Tai O, follow signs to take you away from the transportation area and into Tai O proper. When you're done sightseeing and buying items from the vendors, take the #1 bus to the ferry terminal in Mui Wo. There are two kinds of ferries from the Mui Wo terminal to Hong Kong Central. One takes 30 minutes and the other an hour - the slower one is slightly better for sight-seeing but both are efficient and take the Octopus card.

We got the MTR to Tung Chung and then got the Crystal cabin cable car to the top - the wait was only about 25 mins which was less than I expected - we got the Sky pass which included the cable car, a all day bus pass, dolphin boat ride and the Monkey Tale entrance. The kids loved the crystal cable car and although it was hazy going up it was impressive to see the Buddha in the distance. Once at the top the Ngong Ping village was full of shops - my 15 year old was happy with that and bought a few bits - can recommend the 'Ding Ding candy' from the food shop - wish we had bought more!We decided to walk up to the Buddha first which was great - take it slow, there are lots of steps although beautiful views on the way up so an excuse to catch your breath and take photos. We walked back down and went to the Monkey Tale show - it is really a moral story told by three monkeys - it was nice to sit down in air con but would not have done it if my kids had not wanted to see it. The Kung Fu exhibition is well worth seeing - lots of oohhs and aahhs - very impressive and would be happy to watch it again. We got the bus then to Tai O and got the boat out to see the pink dolphins. If you get this as part of your ticket you need to walk through Tai O a little bit to get the right excursion - the first few boat excursion sellers are quite rude and were a little taken back when I spoke back to them in Chinese.  The boat trip is worth it - we saw a few dolphins which really made the trip. I was last in Tai O about 20 years ago and it has changed a little since then but well worth visiting. All in all a great day - tiring - where comfortable shoes and take plenty of water - would really recommend!"

After an easy commute by bus from Lantao Airport (the number 13) to the monastery (it was definitely better than hanging around there for hours for my flight), I was struck by how an atmosphere of tranquility manages to pervade, despite the crowds. Climbing up to the Big Buddha is of course a must, even with vapour clouds obscuring him. A wander round the monastery itself afterwards was also rewarding and there is a good tea room with a selection of dishes. Definitely recommended."

U can also take the bus up. Ferry can get u to lantau as well then a bus to big buddha at Ngong Ping. Ngong ping is where you can spend about 2-3 hrs or more if u do the walking trails, climb up to see the big buddha close up, catch a show or two. There is shopping of course as well a variety of foods from lamb kebabs to garlic bread..vegetarian meal available up the 280+ steps. Buy meal tickets at the bottom of the steps. If u are taking the cable car back down, u must b back in the terminus by 6pm, so plan out your time well. Note that lines are huge to buy tickets but a separate line for online ticket pickup..no line, no waiting (note online booking must be done at least one day in advance..this is advisable as u can save yourself a couple of hours waiting in line). There is bus to tai o (rural fishing village), also to mei wu (? for ferry) from ngong ping. I found tai o an interesting place (lags behind the rest of hong kong) and u can go out to open sea in a boat excursion n if u r lucky u can see the pink dolphins. Of course, there is disneyland which was low on our priority."

The cable car ride is about 20-25 minutes each way and there is a lot to see on the way up. There were so few people, we got a cable car to ourselves on the way up (without paying the private car surcharge) and shared it with another family of 4 on the way back down. Good clean bathrooms too at both the bottom and the top. We enjoyed the views of the ocean and the mountain and were glad we took this side trip."

Take a cable car from the terminal near Tung Chung MTR station. Queue for the general cabins is very long. So, if you are not cash strapped, ask the assistant manning the line for Crystal Cabin, and immediately you get VIP treatment. They help you buy the ticket, and take you to the boarding area without having to wait long. The best part of the Crystal Cabin is that it has a glass bottom through which you can see the world passing by. You feel like god. It is an amazing experience in itself.The journey to the island offers some spectacular views all along. The view of the giant sitting Budhha from the cable car is beautiful. Once you reach the island, the themed village welcomes you with a plethora of attractions. You can buy t-shirts, gift items, various kinds of food, souvenirs, etc from many shops that dot the village. If you buy the package tour to Tai O fishing village, there is a bus which takes the tourists to the village. Tai O is a very old fishing village with stilt houses around Tung Chung Bay. You can take a stroll through the village market, visit the old temple and take a speed boat ride for half an hour which takes you around the village. It is worth visiting. Especially for people who are interested in photography. But, please remember to get back to your bus on time,as it quite a distance from Ngong Ping.Once back, there is Po Lin monastery and the giant Budhha sitting on top of a hillock. The Budhha is best photographed during the first half of day, as the sun sets behind it, and you might not get a good shot in that light. While returning, please remember that there is a time limit for the cable car, and you must reach the terminal at least 30 minutes before the last departure. For a day trip, it is worth the money you spend."

Once at the top there are several chambers below the Buddha giving useful information for visitors. The Buddha is very impressive, from afar then during the climb to the statue. If you have time in Hong Kong, don't fail to visit."

This was my 2nd visit to Hong Kong in 15 years, and I probably wouldn't have thought of visiting Lantau Island if not for the TripAdvisor reviews... and I'm glad that I did. You can take either a bus or MTR, which would take you at least 45min from Kowloon/Hong Kong to Tung Chung where you will arrive at the cable car station (Ngong Ping 360). With the bus, you will get to go through the world's 7th longest suspension bridge - Tsing Ma bridge. Once you arrived at Tung Chung there is a big shopping mall next to the cable car station, but there are also ample restaurants and street stalls on top of the hill.Try the crystal cabin cable car with the glass-bottom, though it is a little pricey in my opinion. With seemingly no solid footing under your feet, you will get weak knees and have uncontrollable urge to hang on to something in the beginning, but it is fun and the view is spectacular. You get to see a bay on the island as well as the mountains as the cable car climbs. You will also see the Chek Lap Kok airport, and with good weather you can also see Hong Kong island.Once you reach the hill, you will go through some sort of a mock village pathway that tries to emulate a rustic Chinese feel with shops lined up on both sides but fails miserably the moment you see the Subway sandwich sign. Still, you can't fault the effort of the people running the place in trying to monetize the attraction, at least the place is well-maintained. Take the steps up to the big Buddha statue, it is really not that difficult if you consider yourself relatively fit. The magnitude of the statue can only be appreciated once you are right next to it.After you have exerted yourself physically, take a rest at one of the street stalls before you take your ride back. There are various local snacks and the tau foo fah (dessert made from soy bean water) allegedly made with mountain water is a must-try.It was an enjoyable day trip with the family, and I should think you won't regret it if you visit Lantau Island."

The feeling was great as well & the cable car ride was worth the try, as we were able to clearly see the trails on top of the hills not to mention the cool air as we opened the cabin windows. Upon seeing Big Buddha from the cable on the last uphill ride, all of us were really excited. We explored the Ngong Ping Village, after which we headed to climb all 280+ steps. Reaching the top, peace & serenity reigned all over, a good place to medidate & enjoy the nice scenery as well as the cool/foggy weather, Overall, it was really worth the visit."

Went to the giant budha by public transport as well and it took over an hour but was everything l expected, climbed all the stairs to go to the top and the views were fantastic, had lunch at the monastary which was vegetarian and very good, you are given tea with your meal but you have to buy water. We came back by the cable car and it was scary, such steep descents and it was very windy, you can have a glass bottomed cable car or the standard, l suggest the standard if you are scared of heights and if heights absolutely terrify you this would not be a ride to take. Over all a busy tourist trap but well worth a visit."

You can buy a ticket in the booth at the base of the buddha, and eat after you climb the stairs to the top.In the restaurant, you go in and they just bring you veggie dishes, with rice.

We traveled by MRT to Tung Chung station then transferred to the Bus leading to Ngong Ping Village. We didn't take the cable car as we felt it was risky given some reported incidents in the past. The bus ride was like an adventure, as it traveled through zig zag roads. Excellent driving skills - I've taken this trip 3 times already and am always amazed at how good they drive the buses.Main highlight is the Big Buddha, where you have to take about 250 steps up. It has been well kept. There is no entrance fee to go up to the Big Buddha. But there are some counters at the food of the steps which sell you meal tickets. The meal tickets allows you to go inside the Buddha when you get up top, but to me, it's nicer to enjoy the Big Buddha from the outside, you get to go 360 degrees around the Big Buddha anyway without having to pay the meal ticket.You can then visit the temple. Nothing special, but if you haven't seen a temple, it would be good to go in and see.Don't miss the vegetarian food at the temple, cooked Chinese style. Again, if you haven't tried this, it's a learning experience. You can either have a sit down meal or just buy from the snack bar. We didn't get a meal ticket at the entrance, but instead just went to the snack bar to get some food, at least we get to choose what we wanted to eat.If you have some energy to take a walk, just go past the Big Buddha and there is a trail to Wisdom Path, where you can get to see a circle giant wooden posts with Buddhist texts on them. It also offers a great view of the mountains and water. We hiked up one of the highest hills offering magnificent views. Few people know about this area."

When you arrive at Ngong Ping, you will see the usual touristy shops and staff selling you your photo that they took when you board the cable car. If you need to get some souvenirs, skip the expensive touristy shops and you can get some cheaper alternatives as you walk down towards the Big Buddha. You can consider getting some pendants or crystals which were blessed by the monks at the foot and top of the Big Buddha statue.You have to climb up to the Big Buddha if you are here.

The Frommer travel guide states that the ferry and bus times are coordinated so that when you arrive by the ferry you are able to take the bus right away. That was not correct and we had to wait an hour for the bus. During that time we amused ourselves by having breakfast at McDonalds! The bus itself is an air conditioned coach, so quite comfortable. The road to the Buddha offers some great views along the coast. Ngong Ping Village is very commercial with many different shops. We weren't expecting this, but when we browsed in the shops, we found them to have some interesting and good quality merchandise. The Chopstick House was one of particular interest, as was the Peking Opera store. The bathrooms in Ngong Ping Village seem to be the most modern and the cleanest. The ones on the way to the Wisdom Path should be avoided. The giant Buddha is just that - giant. We walked up the many, many stairs in the heat. It was worthwhile - there are some fabulous views from the top. We purchased a meal ticket to eat in the Po Lin Monastery which gave us access to the museum inside the Buddha. If you are limited for time, forego the museum, as it is not very interesting. We walked the 15 minutes to the Wisdom Path. Once again, some gorgeous views. We ate at the Monastery - the budget lunch. We had vegetable soup which was not very tasty, rice and 3 different vegetable dishes. While the food was plentiful and edible, you don't eat there for the food; more for the experience. We did see a monk when we were dining. We took the cable car back to Tung Chung, which was faster than the bus and offered excellent views. There were 4 of us in the cable car - so not crowded in (maximum occupancy is 17). The cable car terminal station is in - you guessed it - a mall! In this case, according to Frommer's, the only real outlet mall in HK. We did not find the prices to be that much less expensive than either at home or in HK proper, but the mall was very busy with shoppers. We took the MTR back to Kowloon, which was efficient and since Tung Chung is the start of the line, we were able to have seats all the way back. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong, visit Lantau Island. While it is still commercial, there is lots of green space, great views, and offers a different perspective on HK."

It was very nice having the entire car to just my daughter and myself. We got a lot of great photos on the ride over to the giant Buddha. There are a LOT of stairs leading up to Buddha, but don't be discouraged. The view from the top is breath-taking (behind Buddha). Mountains roll on as far as the eye can see. I was not expecting such a picturesque scene at the top. Most definitely worth the trek up the many, many stairs. The Wisdom Path is neat, but quite far from everything else. Still, a nice walk through the woods. Don't be surprised if you encounter a large bull on the path. It certainly startled me and was unnerving since it was just my toddler and myself at the time when we ran into it. I asked around about it and was told it lives over in that area. Apparently those bulls are not terribly uncommon on Lantau. It didn't bother us; we just moved out of its way so it could pass. Buddhist vegetarian lunch was quite good and very filling. Enhanced the entire experience. Wonderful day trip. The bathrooms were horrifying. Try to go before you get on the cable car."

If you do a bus tour they take you to the top by bus so you get up close and personal with the Buddha"

Was an enjoyable day overall. The Giant Budda and surrounds are beautiful but it detracted a bit when we found out the statue was built by the government about 12 years ago for the tourist industry rather than being an authentic site. The other thing which detracted a bit was the lack of clean sit down toliets."

If you have half a day of leisure time to spare while in Hong Kong, you may enjoy taking the aerial tram from the MTR station at Tung Chung up the mountain to near the top of Lantau Island at Ngong Ping, where you can see the Tian Tan (\"Giant\") Buddha; the largest, seated, outdoor, bronze Buddha in the world. I enjoyed this outing and found plenty of places to eat and to rest both before and after the aerial tram ride. In addition to the Giant Buddha, spend a little time exploring the grounds of the Po Lin Monastery. I thought it was beautiful up there.The day I was there (a Friday afternoon), the line to buy tickets for the tram was 45-minutes long. People who already had their tickets went right to the front. You might as well opt to buy the tickets for the tram cars with the glass bottom (\"Crystal Cabin\"), because they are not that much more expensive, and it is fun to look directly below you as you proceed up and down this long tram ride; it takes thirty minutes each way. The view from the tram cars is, indeed, quite impressive. Children will love it. Take your camera."

When we arrived at the cable car we were informed that there would be a 45 minute wait. That would have been bad enough but it turned out to be just over two hours! The biggest frustration was the lack of information from the cable car \"organisers\" who told you absolutely nothing apart from a mantra of \"45 minutes\" which after an hour was patently absurd. Book your tickets in advance and you bypass the queue.The journey on the cable car takes almost 30 minutes and provides tremendous views. It was fairly windy on the day we visited and the car does get blown around a bit, but nothing too frightening. Nearing the top we plunged into hill fog and this stayed with us to the end of the journey, To get to the steps leading to the Buddha you pass through a cluster of shops and cafe/restaurants and a variety of statues which line the path. There are several hundred steps leading up to the Buddha and for many it's a tough climb. Unfortunately when I reached the top of the steps, the whole area was enveloped in fog and only the outline of the Big Buddha was visible. Very disappointing but not unexpected.In spite of the long queue and the poor weather I enjoyed the experience and would recommend it to anyone with a reasonable head for heights."

We bought the glass cable car up and decided to take the bus to Tai O fishing village on the way down. Part of your ticket price are these vouchers worth x number of dollars at the shops at the top, so fyi use them if you are going to get a coffee or a trinket.  The glass bottom cable car - a total must! It is a bit of a scary marvel - but still pretty awesome. The day we went was pretty foggy but still at one point when we were floating in a cloud my husband and I had the same 'kids on Christmas morning' look on our faces.  Arriving at Lantau Island is a little weird because there is a Subway and a Starbucks which I get it's a tourist spot but still. There are many tourist shops that sell goods of varying quality.  We did not go to the Tale of the Monkey or the other movie on Buddha but I heard from others that this was a skip.  Big Buddha - the steps are plentiful to get to the top but totally worth it. The Big Buddha makes me smile even now writing this but to others it was a holy experience. It was a powerful experience to see others so overcome with emotion and made me realize how small our world view can be as Westerns.  We left the Buddha and went to the temple for lunch. Now it is with great shame that in one keyboard strike I tell you Westerns should have more of a world view and in the next I write about the lunch. That food was unforgettable and not in a good way. I think if you can maybe you should skip the lunch at the temple and just donate some money. We wanted to be culturally sensitive and not turn our noses up at the food served so we ate as much as we could to check the box.  Seeing the Big Buddha was a highlight of our trip the lunch will go down in the history books. You can see the whole experience on the face of my husband in the attached photo. One note for dog lovers - there are several feral dogs, I saw many puppies on Lantau Island. They must live off the the scraps that people give them as they will follow you if you have food. They are not aggressive or hostile in fact they are quite timid. I saw several people kicking at these animals and it made me sad so just an fyi."

And hidden away over the far side is Tai O island ,step back in time,catch the number 21 bus from golden buddha, this is where until the Hong Kong exchange, was the English navys- weather station !!!!!(we know different).Tai O is conected to Lantau by a small bridge ,before that it was a small boat.It has a very low key history section hidden between the shops,but worth a look to see what it was like.Take a walk through the market and off towards the old police station,and pass rows of silver painted squatters houses,with an official notice saying they will be removing them (shame) later see houses that must have been navel ,but now are homes to the locals.The old police station has been transformed into a hotel,but behind it a the steps to the ex weather station (big sign saying military keep out)Walk along the stone pier and catch a ferry back to Tia O town for $10hk each about \u00a31, first he takes you out to sea to try to spot pink dolphines,then back through the harbour under the bridge you first walked over,up the river to see the houses on stilts,where everybody lives and back to the bridge to get off.All for \u00a31 quite a bargin, so give a tip to the driver not the fare taker on the steps.The town at the end of the Mtr which is where you get off for the Ngon Ping 360 cable car ,has a shopping center full of designer shops ,but these are factory outlet stores,so a bargin may be had ,if your into label wear."

The monkey tale is only for kids (if you do not have them with you, skip it)! Be aware of the fact that the cable care service is VERY UNSTABLE. Not that they are not doing their job, but if there is a thunderstorm warning (remember it is Hong Kong, so every other day...) the will stop the service and you might stuck up there. (They done this to me twice.) Make sure that you do not have to run anywhere after this program."

Lantau Island is one of the biggest islands in Hong Kong and is rich in nature and wilflife, and we recommend this islandas a must see for a family on holiday or even locals if you haven't already been.Lantau Island is packed with great views of the lush green forest and also has a fair share of man made attractions and offers so much to tourists : Great views, calm atmosphere and education/enlightenment.You can take the Ngon Ping 360 cable car transport system and have an option to use the crystal cabin cable car all around the island and you can get to see a beautiful bird's eye-view of the island's forest, which contains a well made hiking trail, if you like long and peaceful walks between or inside a forest.Upon exiting the cable car you are met with a small village which brings souvenir shops, restaurants and small market stands.Souvenir shops are well worth entering themselves as they can make a trip last a lifetime and the restaurants that serve delicious food to keep you full and satisfiedThe island also brings a hint of wildlife; tamed animals that gives the island brings you even more closer to nature and while walking ahead there are buildings and theatres that englighten you on Buddhism, how it started and their religious views.Down the end of the village path leads you to the main attraction: One of the world's largest buddha statues.There is about 200 flights of stairs leading up to the giant buddha statue and it leads to one of the highest points in Hong Kong.Lantau island is definitely one of the must see attractions and is truly a great experience."

It was nice to get out of the city. We went on a misty day and it was still great, with the Buddha appearing out of the mist and clouds.

From the MTR station we did a bit of shopping at the CityGate Outlets, then we caught the #23 bus from CityGate to Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery. Buying the Day pass for HK$35 each worked out cheaper than 2 or three single bus rides - CityGate to Big Buddha, Big Buddha to Tai O, Tai O to the ferry etc).The cable car was not working (maintenance?) and they hadn\u2019t put on any extra buses - the buses come every 25 minutes but there was a queue about 3 busloads long so we ended up waiting about an hour to get on the bus. This was THE worst transport experience in Hong Kong because every other mode of transport in Hong Kong is so good with trains and ferries etc every 5-10 minutes etc. The road journey was interesting with a winding narrow road taking you up into the hills to the Buddha. Where the bus stops is a bit \u201ctouristy\u201d with naff souvenirs etc. Despite the hard sell on the vegetarian lunch for $65 we luckily avoided this as it looked like crap (fried spring rolls, mushrooms and rice). Others have reported it to be the worst meal they had in Hong Kong.It is however worth buying a ticket into the Big Buddha (plus an ice-cream) for $25HKD. The carved/painted panels are worth a look and the ice-cream is your reward for trekking up all those steps!We went to check out Tai O fishing village by bus but it was another 35 minute wait for the next bus and we couldn\u2019t be bothered waiting so we jumped on the bus to Mui Wo, a pretty little fishing village with a couple of nice restaurants perched on the hillside. We had a late lunch there (about 3.30pm) of chicken cashew nuts, sliced beef and vegetables, fried rice, pork and vegetables etc for $280 HKD for three of us (much nicer than the lunch at Po Lin Monastery). We took the fast ferry back from MuiWo to Central getting off at the International Finance Centre (IFC) \u2013 tallest building in Hong Kong \u2013 where we did a bit of browsing around the shops. What a great day!!!"

Although a bit expensive side, this is an experience that is well worth a few hours of your time. Just a few couple minutes walk from Tung Chung MTR station lies the Ngong Ping cable car station. The cable car ride itself is about 25 mins across hills & there are spectacular views of the mountainside trails. You can also see the entire Hong Kong International Airport along the way, with the planes landing, taxiing to the runway and taking off. If you have no fear of heights, take the \u201ccrystal cabins\u201d \u2013 cable cars with a see-through glass floor. Not only is it slightly different & interesting, the queues for these cabins are slightly shorter although there are more of the standard cars hanging on the cables. The crystal cabins are more expensive though, so ask for the promotions prices at the counter before you pay.There will be folks at the base of the station asking you to take package tours or even selling tickets for a bus one way and a cable car the other way back, but I\u2019d highly recommend taking the cable car both ways \u2013 you can always take a bus up a windy mountain road anytime. At the other end of the cable car line lies the somewhat artificial Ngong Ping village. Made to look like old China villages, this place is just the venue of the cable car station and a collection of souvenir shops & restaurants. You will walk past all of this on a well-defined 15min pleasant route to the highlight of the trip \u2013 the big Buddha statue at the top of the hill. From here, there are also public buses to Tai-O, a nearby fishing village. Depending on the weather, I guess it can get pretty cold, hot or wet as there isn\u2019t a lot of shade. I\u2019d also recommend that you check out the opening hours of the cable car ride (I think it changes according to the seasons & also closes for maintenance) then go as early as is practical for your own schedule. The queues can get horrendously long just to get tickets & board the cable cars, as long as an hour or two. And once the queue snakes out of the shaded station area, it can get pretty uncomfortable with the heat & sun, especially if you have kids in tow. Pros:- Unique experience & superb views - Try out the crystal cabins (see-through glass floors)- Very nice way to spend a few hours out of the city Cons: - Not cheap- Queues for the tickets can get extremely long from the late morning onwards"

On Lantau Island also you will find the Sky City Marriott Hotel, one of my favourite hotels, and it is just next to the airport so getting your flight is an absolute breeze! In the Marriott is the Man Ho restaurant. Man Ho is the home of the famous and exquisite KIng Lobster Dumpling which makes gourmets swoon in ecstacy! It made me, The Travelling Gourmet swoon..."

With the cable car out of action on our trip, we had to queue 20 minutes or so for the 30-40 minute bus trip up to the Budha. Due to the queue we knew it would be pretty busy once we up there, we were quite surprised though by the numbers there and the Disney Land feel to the placeThe Budha itself was relatively impressive I suppose but the sheer number of tourists there took a lot away from the attraction in our eyes (seem to be the case everywhere these days)The trip got a lot better once we decided to walk back down to Tung Chung. The walk, which is pretty easy, takes you down the hillside on a concrete path, through some great scenery and past a couple of monasteries, far more authentic than that at the Disneyland like bus drop off!We got a bit lost once at the bottom of the path, where the signing seems to end but we just carried on walking in the same direction, slowly heading towards where the cable cars heading back into Tung Chung and got back to the MTR a bit short of 2 hours after leaving the Budha site.We'd certainly recommend this if you like a bit a walk and fancy getting away from the crowds, bar 4-5 monks, we only encountered another 5 or 6 people on our walk down"

There are nice shops on the walk up to the stairway which many opt to walk up to get to the very top. Some of our party walked up, but some of us took pictures from below and went to the nearby Monastery and had just as much fun. It is an easy metro ride to the cable car.

Hong Kong welcomes you, whether you want to shop, experience its history or to wonder at it\u2019s many tourist attractions.Lantau Island is a trip you can travel to yourself or do as I did, take a guided tour. I recommend this as the driving may well be a bit of a challenge to get to Lantau Island but once there it seemed to be easier.Lantau Island is well known for its Po Lin Monastery and its Giant Buddha. I\u2019d heard about it and thought of it as being a rather large edifice \u2013 Wow it is gigantic, towering over the thousands of visitors who come to see and be in awe of it every day.Seeing it is a bit of a challenge if you go on a slightly inclement day as we did. As we stood and took in its massive frame, fog quickly came and covered it up \u2013 but seconds later, there it was again.On our Lantau Island tour this was our last attraction, on the way to Lantau island we\u2019d also stopped to view the two suspension bridges, one is the largest suspension bridge in the world. After arriving on the island we swapped tour buses and went to a beach then on to the historic and rather quaint Tai O fishing village- this mostly built on stilts and as the name suggests fishing is dominant when you walk through the ancient market streets and go out on the water in a specially built tourist boat.From here we headed to the main attraction: Po Lin monastery and the Giant Buddha.Nothing can prepare you for how large this massive Buddha is.... he is surrounded by beautiful statue ladies as he sits on his lotus leaves. His vital statistics include weighing 250 tonnes and he is 34m tall. You can go inside him and visit ancient Chinese writing and wall art, over two floors.Our tour guide said he was cast in Japan but I have since read it was in China but wherever it was, he now sits huge on the hill in the Ngong Ping Plateau. He has his right hand raised in welcome and it is this welcome you need as you walk up the 200 steps to enjoy him, his maidens and the view around.Don\u2019t worry, you can drive up if you wish.The Monastery he looks down on was once a small place built by three monks, but over the years it has grown to a large and most attractive place for modern monks but also for thousands of Buddhists and general visitors from all over the world. A new hall is being built at the back and when it is finished the monastery will look even more impressive as you walk up to it.Inside the Pin Lo monastery is magic. The three gold statues preside over dozens and dozens of full-in-bloom orchids of all colours. I love orchids so I was in raptures. A monk came in and kneeled to pray \u2013 how personal was that for us to see? I loved being inside this monastery, I quietly stood and looked outside, up the hill to the Giant Buddha, he dominates where-ever you are when at the monastery.We had lunch in the vegetarian restaurant, a seven-course banquet served on the revolving table and the food was, surprisingly, truly delicious.Other attractions we did not visit, so i cannot review them, but I add them so you will know the value of spending time on Lantau Island: Hong Kong Disneyland, nearby the monastery is the Wisdom Path which leads to the Heart Sutra, an outdoor prayer place.There was a huge swimming pool, lots of shopping opportunities and generally the daily life of Lantau Island is easy to see and for you to take memorable photos, as I did... far too many I think!!I know there are plenty of options to get to Lantau Island but as we took the luxury of going on a tour I cannot list the transport arrangements here: the massive cableway was not working and is due to open midway through 2012."

A nice long climb up to the Big Buddha. We even visited Anita Mui's niche. I'm quite a fan of hers so it was a nice. We also went to the Wisdom Path. Unfortunately, the words were in traditional mandarin so I didn't quite understand what were written on the large sticks. But the view was really great.After that, we took another bus to Tai-O. That was a really worthwhile trip. We took the boat out to see the dolphin but didn't see a single one, unfortunately. My young son was very disappointed. But the walk around the fishing village was a really great one, seeing the house on stilts, live seafood and tasting the yummy street food."

We were kind of afraid to stand on the glass floor though. Before reaching the steps to the Giant Buddha, you will come across some shops, restaurants, and photo-op attractions like old cable cars. The climb was pretty tiring but it was worth it! The Giant Buddha looks remarkable and so is the view from the top! Make sure to wear comfortable shoes as you will be doing a lot of roaming!"

The Big Buddha is great to see - and there is a beautiful monastery at the foot of the Buddha where you can get some lovely food. It's a very nice day out."

To a trip to the old stilted fishing village of tai o or just enjoy cheung sha beach where you can get some good food a sun tan and well chilled out. An alternative is the walk from mui wo over to discovery bay or vice versa. Both spots have regular ferries back to central."

South Lantau is a National Park and there are the most wonderful walks and hikes.

The man stopped playing when I picked up my camera and disappeared but returned quickly with another string instrument whose name I don't know but it seemed of the place. He proudly let me take his picture. That was a special moment. The seated Buddha was impressively big, but the village shops and Starbucks gave the whole Buddha area a very commercial tone. The vegetarian meal at the Po Lin monastery was the deluxe and I liked it but I've had much better in my home town. The drive took us past several beautiful beaches which in warmer times might be inviting."

The Buddha statue sits at the top of a large staircase and provides a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The swastika on Buddha\u2019s chest may seem a little disconcerting, but keep in mind the symbol was used in Chinese culture long before the Nazis hijacked it. If you don\u2019t mind a walk, the Path of Wisdom is just fifteen minutes from the main area. Large, carved planks of wood are set upright in the ground along the path and stretch more than thirty feet into the air. Arranged in a figure eight pattern to represent infinity, they are quite an impressive sight set against the backdrop of mountains.Read more and see photos at:www.thetattooedtraveler.com"

The airport is here, but the \"big\" draw here is the Big Buddha at the Po Lin Monastery. You can take a bus up there if you like to avoid the crowds or don't like heights - otherwise take the cable car which affords wonderful views of the South China sea below. I didn't like the theme-park like restaurants and shops that they have since built at the entrance to the Monastery but get past the fast-food joints and wonder at the feat of engineering that put the biggest bronze statue of the Buddha in the world at the summit of some hundreds of steps. And the view from the top is stunning. The termples at the monastery are beautiful and work is currently underway to build a bigger one (this spoils the view a little, but the price of progress i guess). The meal at the vegetarian restaurant was excellent value too and makes a nice stop for lunch.If you have the time, take a stroll along the Wisdom path which leads away from the Monastery and the crowds. It is clearly signposted and affords beautiful views of the island's mountains and surrounding countryside."

You can easily reach this site by metro and the cable car station is just near the metro station. I would advise you to go up by the cable car and down by local charter bus because it is significantly cheaper and more fun (at time of visit the price of round trip on the cable car was 140HKD and the one-day pass on any local bus route with included coupon to one free cable car trip cost was 104HKD). There is no admission fee to visit monastery itself.At the time I've been there the weather was very misty, nevertheless the view from the cable car cabin was great! The cable road is long, makes some twists over the mountains so you will have a good chance to see the most part of Lantau from the cabin.As to the monastery itself sure you'll fill a touch of the good aura of this place. I saw quite a number of shrines, but, man, this is a special one! I can add no more words - just try to get there and see it yourself if you are in Hong Kong."

There are 2 museums there , one about a monkey and one on Buddha story. Honestly you can skip this.  We did the big vegetarian lunch at the monastery. It was good but no meat! It was tasty, I didnt see a bunch of other restaurants there so not sure if there are better options.Take the bus from the top to Tai O. The narrow streets and stilt homes of this small fishing village must be seen. As must do is the market area. It is quite a site and reminds one of rural China. Lots of open air stalls, seeling fresh fish and slated ones, veggies etc.. There is also a small temple that was worth a stop into,..I saw numerous tiny dolphin excursion boats. i am not surre I would truat goimg out on these rinky dink boats but you can decide for yourself.. After this take the bus to Cheung Sha Beach for a swim. Or go directly to Mui Wo, possibly for dinner.

Po Lin Monastery is at the same place and is worth visiting - you will see the robed monks going about their daily business and can purchase a vegetarian meal if you wish. A small Disneyland has recently been built on Lantau Island and this can be accessed by the MTR. We didn't go into the theme park but visited the Disneyland hotel which was beautiful. A marble and glass creation, very tastefully done with a choice of restaurants, lovely views and a souvenir shop. On the far side of Lantau is a small fishing village called Tai O which is worth a visit - some residents still live in houses on stilts in the river.

The only outlet shopping mall is here in Tung Chung, but more than that, there's the Big Buddha and the hills of Lantau Island to explore. If you have plenty of time, you can even hike up to Big Buddha, but for those on a schedule, there's the Ngong Ping cable car that can do the legwork. Yes, the area around Bing Buddha it is a pretty crowded place, though it is nothing compared to crowds of HK island, and it's a totally different side of HK that you just don't get to see in Central or in Kowloon. Despite the crowds, it feels quite serene and spiritual, perhaps because the Buddha is sharing that hill with Po Lin monastery and temple. There are plenty of people praying and the smell of incense and birdsong fill the air. Here and there monks go about their daily wanderings. It's a pretty nice place to just be and watch the life go by, and if you're up there between 12 and 4pm you can partake in the vegetarian lunch prepared by the monks. The only thing is that the line ups for Ngong Ping cable car can get pretty long. The day we were there, the line up to get back down was 3 hours long. Something we found out accidentally - if you buy a Crystal Car ticket for the cable car on the way up, then you get to go into a separate, much shorter line! We did, and our line up on the way back was only 1 hour instead of 3!Some photos of our trip to Big Buddha here: http://lenamitranic.smugmug.com/Travel/Hong-Kong/20951232_6P2GNm"

When finally made it on the second try, we were impressed with the cable car ride (pay for the one with the see-through bottom on the way up) that took us across many passes. However, it was a tremendous disappointment to arrive in what they will call a \"culturally themed\" (read: commercialized) master planned \"buddhist village\" consisting of chain establishments (i.e., Starbucks), restaurants, shops and - because it was Christmas - vendors booths that schpeeled fake snow and sold and Christmas related junk like snowmen, elves, and miscellaneous ornaments. All this occurs at the base of the Giant Buddha - how inconsistent with the meditative and spiritual nature of Buddhism! A fascinating tourist attraction (if for no other reason than to see the odd contradictions of Buddhist spirituality and western commercialization) - but don't come and expect a pure Buddhist spiritual experience."

It seemed a bit strange, as Lantau Island is still larger than Hong Kong Island, and there's an awful lot of it that hasn't had an airport built on top of it. Yes, it's not 100% unspoilt by the 21st century (there's a Disneyland, and there are buildings, and roads, yes...) but there's still plenty of space to go for a hike and forget that you're in one of the most densely populated parts of the world.Much of Lantau is still as sleepy as it was before - don't let more regular ferries and an MTR connection at Tung Chung put you off - you can still get a very rural experience in Lantau. I would recommend (if you're in the mood for a strenuous hike) that you try Sunset Peak from Mui Wo. If you just want a more relaxing day, then the beach at Pui O is usually very nice. Other attractions like the Big Buddha and the Ngong Ping 360 are worthy of their own reviews...If you're visiting Hong Kong solely because it's a big, exciting city, then Lantau is probably not for you. If you're here for a little longer and fancy a break from the hectic downtown rush, certainly worth getting out here."

It has a Giant Buddha for culture vultures, and excellent restaurants they speak little English but are very friendly. The restaurants may look a little scruffy but the food is exquisite."

It was fairly easy to get to. I read the reviews here and was good to go. I had intended to go on a weekday, taking the advice of some contributors here to avoid crowds and save money. BUt i had a free sunday and decided to go on a sunday instead.I took the MTR to Central and took the ferry over.I took the fast ferry b/c i missed the slow one. But i was relieved while on the ferry to take the 'fast ferry' (which is 30 min vs 1 hour). the water does get rather choppy and rough at times. (fast ferry cost around double the price of the slow one).i arrived at about 11am so it wasn't too crowded. I then took a bus up to the BB. There were a few tour buses there but not bad. The stairs going up to BB wasn't bad at all. I expected more climbing but it was quite do-able (and I have exercise induced asthma). I explored for about an hour. If i had more company maybe we could have hiked more. I had some lunch at one of their 'dai pai dongs' and had a tofu dessert. They seem to have advertise that alot. I also went to Tai O, which i really didn't see much. Many vendors selling dried goods/seafood. Go early, enjoy the scenery and fresh air. There are vendors selling souvenirs as well. When i got back to the pier, Mui o (?) i had some clams with rice. I was very disappointed. There were a bunch of restaurants concentrated there. THe lady gave me a chinese menu and i ordered from that. I ordered clams but they came out super super small and at least 1/2 didn't even hav e meat in them. i think overseas they would not allow one to net clams that small. Anyway, when the bill came i noticed she shortchanged me. Then i asked her wasn't the price xxx and she pretended she didn't know the price on the chiniese menu and pointed to a banner w/ the english menu. She comes back and the change still isn't right. I decided not to hassle and deal with her and just left. But a bit disappointed nto to have some good seafood choices."

THere are two types of cable car, standard and glass bottom. You are so high up, that the glass bottom cable car is not more scary, it just gives you a better view. Its very safe, steady and fast moving. THe whole 7km journey takes about 25 minutes. Take the 400 or so steps up to the Buddha and take in the glorious views. Althouhg i havent tried it, the vegeterian meals availalbe are worth a try. Alternatively for the more fit, there is a hiking trail which goes along the same route as the cable car, taking about 6 hours or so.. not light walking.2. Enjoy many outlet stores here such as Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Bally etc for some great discounts. Be prepared for some long ques at checkout with Chinese tourists buying goods enough to fill multiple suit cases.. this is no joke!3. This is a very popular spot for ex-pats. Considered an environmentally green zone with no car access. Access is by ferry from Central HK Island, or buy bus from Tung Chung. THere is a nice shopping mall and numerous restaurants/bars such as an Irish pub etc.. Commuting is by foot or golf buggy! A must see on your list of things to do in Hong KOng4.

They are not comfortable with English though, so don't bother asking, most nationalities have a visa on entry so just walk out of the Airport and hop on to the bus to Lantau Island. I think it is the S1 that takes you to Tung Chung metro station from where you can easily walk to the Ngong Ping cable car terminal. The most famous attraction of Lantau is the Bronze buddha statue at the top of the mountain and the journey to the top is part of the fun. You can drive, take the bus or use the cable car. The latter is the recommended option, see my revies for Ngong ping cable car for detailsOnce on top you can visit the village, pay your respects to lord buddha at the temple. The bronze buddha is in need of maintenance and polishing. The trip from the Airport and back including the visit to the buddha would take approx 6 hours ( time I took ) if you use the cable car and 10 hours if you use bus service. All in all : a very good way to kill some time and experience some local culture, cuisine and do some sightseeingthe trip including the cable car set me back only by ~ HK$ 250 (including 1 meal)you can also shop for souvenirs, Shops are reasonably priced."

The views are little short of spectacular though check the weather first for a clear day (you will see more) and for the wind (it can get pretty windy up there as they are steep ridges). Easy to get there and back - take the ferry to Mui Wo from Central pier (about 30 mins) where you can stock up on food/water/supplies from the supermarket. From Mui Wo walk up South Lantau road for about 3km until you get to Nam Shan (a little campsite area with toilet etc). Then take the Lantau trail and stay on it for the next 12-15km over Sunset and Lantau peak, then down to the big buddah. From the big buddah you can take the bus back to Mui Wo. Absolutely awesome!"

The scenery is fabulous and the Big Buddha very impressive, though the whole experience is very kitsch; in the tourist-themed Chinese village we had to endure awful jazzed up Christmas carol music all the time.But! I have advice: There are two ways to avoid the queues. I would recommend you just get the bus up to the village and the cable car down. Problem is, nobody tells you about the bus. I think it is no 23 and it goes from the MTR station on Lantau and is very cheap (about $17). I discovered it by accident because we had to come back by bus after the cable car broke down! I suspect if you took the bus up to the village in the morning, you'd have very little queuing for the cable car ride back.Alternatively, most of the queuing is to buy the ticket - if you have bought a ticket online in advance, you can bypass much of it, though you still have to queue to get on the cable car. We queued for around 2 hr; I think it would have been more like 30 min if we'd had an online ticket.I was surprised at the lack of Tourist INformation at Hong Kong MTR or on arrival at Lantau: we'd originally thought we'd like to go back by ferry, but it was difficult to find out how to do that . I noticed there was a bus from the Buddha place to a ferry so that might be another option."

The cable car journey is enjoyable, however weather dependent. On arriving at the top station, there\u2019s a very touristy shopping precinct (including Subway and 7-Eleven) \u2013 the Buddha is about 10 minutes walk, followed up a ~250-step climb to reach the Buddha itself. Included in the return cable car ticket is the \u2018Walking with Buddha\u2019 experience, accessible from the shopping precinct near the top station. It\u2019s a short but informative story on Siddhartha Gautama\u2019s path to enlightenment as Buddha.Tip, the nearby Po Lin Monestary is worth a visit. It also provides a more genuine lunch experience than the main shopping precinct \u2013 although noting their all-vegetarian menu may not be to everyone\u2019s taste. Tip, it\u2019s worth noting that on a foggy day you have difficulty seeing the Buddha when you\u2019re standing right below it \u2013 although there\u2019s a degree of charm with fog, I\u2019d highly recommend you check the Lantau Island weather before setting off."

We managed to get a small window where the buddha wasn't completely shrouded in clouds, but that didn't last long. It started to clear a bit on the way down but that is the risk you have if you go up when its not clear. The lines are crazy. The crystal car is a bit more expensive, but it might be worth it if you can skip the line. I bought a metro day pass and it had a 10% off coupon in it, i'm not sure if it is valid for the crystal car or not as i forgot to actually use it and i opted for the cheaper car. We didn't take the ferry - we arrived and the ferry had gone and it was 40mins to wait for the next so we took the subway, think is was 22HKG$ out (hence buying the day pass for $55).After you get to the top of the cable car you end up in this tourist trap, walk through it to get to the bottom of the buddha. If you want to eat or see the buddha museum you can buy a dinner ticket for $60, the museum is under the buddha statue rather small, mostly in chinese), the dinner is at the veggie restaurant (follow the signs). Lunch was veggie soup, silken tofu and veggies, firm tofu and veggies, bok choi and deep fried spring rollsThere is also massive mall at the exit of the subway, apparently it is an outlet mall but i checked the prices and if you live in north america there was nothing that I saw worth buying (perhaps super high end stuff is a decent price but i was checked standard shops that would be in malls at home)"

            "review": "One day picnic. We were told that the travel to Lantau takes a long time - almost 2 hours from HK island and were always deferring the trip there due to the travel time. However, come October (better climate in HK), we decided to visit Lantau. Reaching Lantau is not easy. One has multiple options with combination of MTR ( till tung chung), bus or cable car; or ferry from central and then bus. Be prepared for long queues if you are travelling on weekend. Once you reach Lantau (base of big buddha) you realise that the travel time was worth it. The approach to statue has road side shops for food and nice gates for photos. The climb to big buddha is almost 250 stairs. So be prepared. But once you are on top, the climb is worth it. The view is fabulous. For once you will not find a concrete structure in HK, its all nice and green. Take pictures of buddha, view the gallery and just enjoy the greenery. After coming down, do not miss the monastary. Its a nice old temple of buddha and certainly a visit. Full veg food served here as well. Overall, an excellent day spent. Although bulk of time is spent in travelling, its convenient and worth it. The kids enjoyed the open space and would like to go back again soon."

I then took the cable car ride back down the mountain to the subway system, MTR. I took the subway back to Hong Kong Central. The site is fantastic,but has all the elements of a tourist location. Lots of little shops trying to sell you trinkets,etc. I went to the cable car site first and worked my way back to the Buddha. You walk up an incredible set of stairs,like a stairmaster. The Buddha is enormous and very inspiring and sits atop a temple. Next to this, is the monastery. Like all Buddhist monasteries, light joss sticks is important and mystical. I must have spent at least 3 hours walking around and sensing a confectioner to the energies of life. It's a little weird. Coming was a bit jarring"

We opted to go on the 360 tour with the crystal cabin please remember to utlise the 10 % discount voucher which you received with your travel ticket.Cabel car ride was fantastic and by us choosing the crystal cabin this has a glass floor which allows you to see more. We dont want to say too much as it will spoil the experience but it is a must!!!Another experience included in the tour was the fishing village. A wonderful opportunity to meet the real locals which keeps the fishing village alive. Remember these locals have gone through real hardship but still have a warm heart and a smile on their faces. There are places to eat there and the food is fantastic but please remember this is a local village and every penny you spend helps them survive and maintain their way of life which is a dying art. The little stalls are run by the older generations who support their families and are trying to continue the tradition ... So spend spend spend :) and help this community to continue with the additional income which, us as tourists, which is their main lifeline.We would recommend if you don't do the 360 tour to actually arrange to visit the fishing village independantly and spend sometime with the real people.The Big Budha is a sight to be hold however the 200 plus steps can prove to be a challange especially in the hot humidity but at least you can get a cool refreshing icecream or drink."

Lantau island is a good place for a half day sightseeing in hong kong apart from the ocean park, victoria peak, victoria harbour, ladies market, disney land etc etc.There are 2 ways of reaching the iland 1 by the Ngong Ping 360 cable car & the 2nd one by bus. We choose to travel by the cable car. We started at 8.00 am in the morning and came back by 6.00 pm so it was almost a full day. The cable car ride to the top is just awesome having some excellent views of the city, airport, sorroundings etc etc. The ride is about 20 mins approx (dont remember clearly though). On top there is a buddha statue & A Buddha Temple. There are a couple of eateries on top which also serve indian food and theres also a subway on top so indian/vegan travellers neednt worry about the food. On top after you aling from the cable car you will enter the nong ping village where the statue, temple, shops & the eateries are there. The Place is very neat, clean and maintained very nicely. During winter this place gets very chilly so its important that you carry good wollens with you. I would conclude by recommending everyone of those who love cable cars, Buddhist Monestries to going to this place."

The trip lasts 20 min each way. We just visited the Big Buddha and the wisdow path. On that day it was too hot with over 90% humidity so we didnt have the courage to continue to the Thai O fishing village, which I suppose was worth a visit. So make sure not to go on a very hot day to enjoy it to the maximum. Glad that on the return way we didnt have to wait more than 5 min for the cable car.

The Giant Buddha is a very impressive and well worth climbing the 200 or so steps to access some great views over the South China Sea.It was really hot and humid in July so bring comfortable shoes for lots of walking and a hat or brolly for the strong sun.Upon our return to Citygate we done some shopping in the outlet centre(lots of shops) and then got on the E11 double decker public bus for another scenic trip back to central.Loved the whole experience and would highly recommend it for a full day out of the city.Bring your camera!!"

We started with a viewing of the Tsing=Ma bridge - world's longest suspension bridge and a very impressive engineering feat. Great views of the Hong Kong landscape. Then we changed buses for the trip to Lantau Island. Kim the guide was knowledgeable and entertaining, taking us to Hong Kong's longest beach (okay, not long by Australian standards) then on to the Tai-O Fishing village. We were guided through the village market past traditional stilt houses and into a Taoist temple where we were informed about the differences between Taoism and Buddhism and some of the practices there - notably the protector of fishermen. The cable car was down for it's annual safety overhaul, so the bus took us up to the Po-Lin monastery and the giant seated Buddha at the top of the mountain. We viewed the Buddha museum and then the Buddha statue. It is an impressive sculpture, noted as the world's largest outdoor seated bronze Buddha. This was followed by a visit to the Po-Lin (precious lotus) Monastery - a working buddhist monastery. Lunch at the monastery was included in the price and it was a wonderful vegetarian banquet. The location was perfect, nestled among cloud-tipped peaks with waves of distant hills off to the horizon. All up it was a great way to spend a day and such a contrast with the bustle of the shopping districts."

I was happy with that decision as it allowed me to enjoy the scenic ride out there, plus my hotel is in Central so it made it an easier decision. Went and saw the Big Buddha, ate the vegetarian Monestary lunch (did not splurge for the upgraded lunch). The lunch was good, if a bit bland. Rice, potato soup, with a couple sides of sauteed veggies. The Buddha was worth the trip and it's a very pretty, scenic change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the city. I took the air tram back down the mountain, it's a more direct way back and the views shouldn't be missed. Followed by a long and expensive taxi ride back to Central. I'd take this to and from route again as I think it served the purpose of leisure going and expedited coming back perfectly. The only change I would consider is possibly taking public transportation for that last leg if I was spending my own $$. On the way back, we saw hikers out walking the very well maintained trails. If I went back I would add that to my journey, but it would add quite a bit of extra time and walking to an already full half day affair. Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely."

We certainly enjoyed our afternoon out to 'The Big Bhudda' - but here are a few tips that some might find useful (and that we would follow if we were to do the trip again!):1. Book on-line. This approach might get you a discount (depending on which tour or ticket you choose), but more importantly will allow you to avoid the queue to buy tickets (it took us an hour of lining up to get the tickets). Go to [--]2. Book a day ahead - the book on line feature doesn't let you book a same day ticket (we discovered - which is why we ended up having to line up)3. Book the crystal cabin if you have the spare cash - Firstly it's totally cool (and not as scary as I thought it would be) to be able to see through the floor. But secondly, when you are coming down from the Bhudda the line for the crystal cabin are a lot shorter.4. If you don't want to spend quite as much on the cablecar ride, consider buying the 'one way crystal ride, other way regular car ride' option- and then ask if you can have the crystal ride coming down rather than up (see note 3)5. If you book on line - when you get to the cable car terminal - DO NOT join the huge line - follow signs for prebooked tickets and tours (or ask the attendant where to go) - and you get to avoid the first line6. Take an umbrella!So we didn't follow any of our tips. We took the MTR to Tung Chung station, and then followed the signs out of the station to get to the Cable Car Terminal. The train ride was about thirty minutes from Central.We waited in the heat for more than an hour just to get to the ticket booth. And just when we thought we were done with lining up, we then had to line up for another half hour (after purchasing the tickets) to actually get onto the cable car. (See photos of queues).The cable cars carry a maximum of 10 - with most actually carrying between 7 and 10.It was spitting with rain when we arrived at the top. It was still hot though. The 'village' was a little bit 'Disneyfied', and very touristy (there was a Starbucks and a Subway up there for example), but plenty of things to do (and plenty of things to buy!)Walking up the steps to the Buddha was certainly a work out - but worth it for the view!"

Lantau Island isn't an actual attraction itself, it is one of the main islands in Hong Kong which hosts several main attractions as well as our international airport (HKIA). You can make one of several great day trips to Lantau island, here are some, not in particular order of preference. 1.) Disneyland (1 day trip or combine with Ngong Ping 360). Have a day at Disney, can't go wrong if you've kids. Alternatively, go to Disneyland early so you can finish in 3-4 hours, then head to CityGate for lunch and spend the afternoon at the Ngong Ping 360 attraction, seeing the Giant Buddha. 2.) Ngong Ping 360 (1/2 - 3/4 day trip or combine with Tai O fishing village to make 3/4 to full day trip). If you have the energy and stamina you can go for Disney first than Ngong Ping 360 as mentioned above. Alternatively, visit Ngong Ping 360, the Giant Buddha and Po Lin Monastery more casually. If you have time and interest, you can add the Tai O fishing village with is nearby. 3.) Lantau Island Hiking - there are some great trails for hiking in Lantau island, you can even hike all the way to the Giant Buddha. This is a popular activity for hiking enthusiasts in Hong Kong. This can be a good way to avoid the chaos from the city. We recommend at least 1 day in Lantau for visitors to Hong Kong and 2 if you want to have separate visits to Disney and Ngong Ping360"

At the cable car station, we purchased a package that included round-trip on the cable, and a tour of the fishing village and the area below the Buddha. We were escorted to the ticket booth and aided in buying our tickets. The cable car ride was lovely, and the sight of the Giant Buddha as we came over the hill was fabuous. We met Peter, our guide, in the village at the top of the cable car. We boarded a bus to the Tai O fishing village, where Peter escorted us through the market place, pointing out the various delicacies. We also visited a Taoist Temple and learned about the rituals used there. We boarded the bus again and were taken to the area below the Giant Buddha. Peter pointed out various points of interest and then left us at the Po Lin Monastery, the end of the tour. We decided to have lunch at the monastery, as others at this site had recommentded it. This was a big mistake. The food was the worst we had on our entire trip. The spring rolls tasted as though they had been fried in oil that was going rancid. The rest of the food was so oily, it was inedible. I would not recommend that anyone eat at the monastery! After lunch, we walked out to the Wisdom Path, definitely worth the walk. We decided that our knees could not handle the stairs to the Buddha, but enjoyed the view from below. Overall, we would recommend doing this day trip. We felt that signing up for the tour was a good idea, and having Peter as a guide added to the overall experience and allowed us to relax and enjoy ourselves without the worry of how we would get from one place to another. We would recommend this tour for those who, like us, are less adventurous."

Found the village kitschy and not particularly interesting, but VERY much enjoyed strolling around the monastery/temple grounds (felt more like PRC than HK) where we had a satisfying and inexpensive lunch. (NB: the \"deluxe\" lunch for two is worth the extra few dollars for the nicer seating; the \"regular\" lunch venue looks a bit like a school cafeteria).We spent about 5.5 hours total, including subway ride from our Kowloon hotel. Frommers recommends taking the ferry to Lantau island and the cable-car back, which we probably would have done if we had gotten an earlier start."

It's easy to get there by MTR (Tung Chung), then the fun starts at the cable car. As I had to cue for an hour I guess it makes sense to buy tickets online in advance, but even though I had to wait so long the breathtaking ride in the glass-bottom gondola over the bay and through the lush green mountains to Ngong Ping 360\u00b0 was definitely worth it.The artificial Ngong Ping village at the end of the cable car ride was not a highlight in partiular, but the giant Buddha statue and the Po-Lin Monastery were amazing. Really beautiful and impressive! Even though there were many tourists I found some quiet spots to sit down and marvel at the view from the Buddha platform and in the shady courtyards of the monastery. As a vegetarian I appreciated the vegatarian lunch at the monastery very much and I was lucky enough to hear a chanting ceremony after lunch.In the afternoon I took the bus to the fishing village Tai-O, which was also a nice change to hectic Hong Kong, and from there the bus back to the MTR station, which took a bit over 45 minutes. So if you don't want to rush through all the sights, but have some time to enjoy the scenery and serenity, better plan a relaxed daytrip to Lantau Island."

The fishing village was very interesting, the community live in houses built on stilts over the water and then the market was filled with every type of dried and fresh fish you can imagine, as well as some you can't! The buddha was great, the views were fabulous from the top although the stairs aren't for the faint of heart. The cable car was also good, although I wasn't too impressed with all the stopping it did. Having said that our guide said it almost never happened and I don't particularly like heights. No-one else on our car seemed that bothered.It's definitely worth visiting the island, although I think to get around all the sights you would need to go with a tour group. It's good to see another side of Hong Kong."

The vegeterian foods served in Pa lin Monastery is very good with vareity of chinese vegeterian dishes served which is good for a healthy diet. The atmosphere in the monastery is full of prayer chants and the smell of incense. Also the visit to the local fishing community hamlets and their market will give as insight to the old hongkong fisherman culture. The end of the trip was a visit to Tea Making Shop which makes fantastic tea. I was suprised to see to tea blossiming in to flower when dipped in hot water and the green tea they prepared was of great refreshing taste."

I found it to be a great way to see the island, the small villages that are along the bus route down from the top of the island. Enjoyed a \"deluxe\" vegetarian meal (100HKD includes entry to visit the Buddha and a museum) at the monestary as well as some relaxing moments under the trees listening the to birds chirping, a welcomed change from the noise pollution of HK! The big Buddha is pretty impressive, but the museum inside I could have skipped.Renovations are landscaping being done at the base entrance to the monestery so you'll ned to watch your step."

The only sign on most of the island that you are still in Hong Kong is the Ngong Ping 360 cable car taking tourists up to the Giant Buddha, and a walking path you can take to hike up there yourself if you are a masochist and don't mind suffering in the heat and humidity. If you do, you are rewarded with fantastic views on a less-smoggy day (preferably in the morning hours to get better views before it heats up and the smog settles in).Lantau is an easy Metro ride from Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Takes about 25 minutes from Mongkok, probably 15 from Hong Kong Central. There is also a ferry you can take there, but if you want to visit the Giant Buddha, the metro is the way to go."

It is a beautiful, clean, friendly place with lots of attractions to go to. We went to Disneyland for one and a half days and it was just awesome. We also visited Ngong Ping and Tian Tan. The place is average but a different scenery. We also booked through Asiatravel a room in Silvermine Beach Hotel, also in Lantau Island. We were very pleased with the service of Asiatravel. Our check in was a breeze. The hotel however is also average, nothing to get so excited about. The staff are friendly though. Tung Chung mtr station is also nearby. From there we were able to visit Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. There is also a ferry terminal in Lantau Isaland, that is in Mui Wo. The fast craft is really fast and steady. The Citygate Mall near Tung Chung mtr is a treasure spot because it has outlet stores of branded items like Nike, Roxy, Adidas, Columbia, Esprit, Giordano etc. We really got big discounts as big as 60% off. The buses in Lantau really do follow the time schedule, very disciplined. One advantage of being in Lantau Island is that it is near the International Airport. One could reach the airport from Tung Chung terminal at about 10 minutes for only 3.50 HKD via S1 Bus. I love Lantau Island, quiet and pleasant."

The place or path consists of 38 wood columns with calligraphic inscription of the \u201cHeart Sutra\u201d position along the hill.Many might not understand the Chinese words or even understand the \u201cHeart Sutra\u201d but this walking trail or the large open space might be nice for people who enjoyed the nature.Personally walked here in the winter season and it was very cooling and nice weather.

We took the subway MTR to Tung Chung (I guess it is not a subway when it goes above the ground), and then the cable car to the top. Do take the cable car. It's better than walking and then have more time and energy for everything else. Of course visit the Giant Buddha and the Monastery. I too would skip the 2 museums there about the monkey and the Buddha story. We did the big vegetarian lunch at the monastery. It was good but there may be better options. Take the bus from the top to Tai O. The narrow streets and stilt homes of this small fishing village must be seen. As must the market area. It is quite a site and reminds one of rural China.We did not take any of the numerous tiny dolphin excursion boats. To my eyes, the seaworthiness of these crafts were questionable, but that's jsut me. After this take the bus to Cheung Sha Beach for a swim. Or go directly to Mui Wo, possibly for dinner. From there, take the ferry (every hour) back to Central. Then we took the Star Ferry back to Kowloon and watched the light show. It was a great day. Enjoy!"

The massive bronze Buddha and the views from the Buddha platform are just absolutely beautiful and what a huge contrast from the views on Victoria Peak! You forget to realise that only a small percentage of the Hong Kong islands are occupied and there are still quite a lot of undeveloped islands.When we went there last year (Sept. 2007) the cable car that takes you from Tung Chung town centre to Ngong Ping was shut down (due to an accident where an empty cable car fell off the cable and crashed but I believe it reopened earlier this year.) It was probably a good thing for me as I am absolutely terrified of heights and would have just died. We took the MTR to Tung Chung station and took the Tung Chung - Ngong Ping bus No. 23 (you can swipe your Octopus card here) Tip: try to come here between Monday to Saturday as these are their \"off peak\" days and Sundays are their \"peak days\" where the bus fares are more expensive (one-way $25 compared to $16) and there are a lot more tourists around.The bus ride takes around 1 hour to get there but it's quite scenic and quite relaxing. You will drive past small pockets of villages that dot these hills and a few seaside towns.Our first impression of the seated Buddha atop a mountain was just spectacular! What a sight to behold! It was pictures galore from here on! We climbed the 256 steps to get to the platform (16 sets of 16 stairs - I am not sure what this signifies) and stopped several times as this had been my first exercise in years! It was also a good way of getting a ton of pictures from these steps. When you get to the top, you will be greeted by 8 smaller bronze statues (beautiful as well). Access to the Buddha is free but if you want to go to the exhibition halls below the Buddha it will cost around HK$60 (a vegetarian meal is included as well). There are also a number of little stalls selling Buddha related souvenirs such as necklackes, statues, incense, etc.We spent about half an hour wandering around and taking lots of gorgeous photos of the Buddha and the lush green scenery below. We then headed to the Po Lin Monastery where the main temple houses 3 bronze statues of the Buddha representing his past, present and future lives as well as many Buddhist scriptures. Again, there was a lot of photo opportunities in this wonderful and interesting monastery.After about an hours and a half we caught the bus back to Tung Chung where we discovered the new Citygate mall. It's not a huge mall compared to the malls in the mainland but still quite good value as this is mostly a factory outlet selling well known brands - Nike, Adidas, Shanghai Tang, Ralph Lauren etc. It was the end of the summer shopping festival when we got here and we stumbled upon the entire Ralph Lauren store for 50% off! Not a bad mall at all!Tip: If you're on a limited time in Hong Kong, definitely do the Buddha and Po Lin Monastery in the morning. It should only take you 2 hours return by bus transport and another 1 hour to admire the area then you're done and have the whole day free for another activity!"

I would highly recommend the walk, but don't forget sun screen and water. The path is easy to follow, not too rough or steep but you would need reasonable footwear. It was very quiet, we only passed a few other people, and it gave us a chance to appreciate the wild life and views at a leisurely pace. The only difficulty was once we got back to Tung Chung- we took a wrong turning, but follow the main road round and there are maps on lamp posts to help you. This was one of our favorite days, the busyness of the statue were nicely counterbalanced by the solitude of the relaxing walk down the hillside."

We took the MTR from Hong Kong station to Tung Chung station (the last stop on the Tung Chung line). The fare was about HK$20.10 per person one way using the Octopus card.From Tung Chung, we took bus no 23 from the bus terminus in Tung Chung town and enjoyed a 1 hour journey through the hills and seaside beaches towards the town of Ngong Ping where the sitting Buddha and the Po Lin monastery are located. The first glimpse of the sitting Buddha is truly awe inspiring and to climb the 259 steps up to the statue is really an unforgettable experience. On the way up, you can view the spectacular rural scenery and green verdant hills surrounding the area. In the distance, we could see the cable cars of the yet to be opened Ngong Ping 360 being put through their trial runs.We spent about an hour taking photos and admiring the scenery before making our way down again to catch bus no 23 back to Tung Chung.At Tung Chung, we also took the opportunity to do a bit of shopping at the newly opened Citygate mall. There are various factory outlets of well known brands like Adidas, Nike and Samsonite, selling goods at very good bargains. I got a Samsonite back pack for about HK$180 which I believe is an absolute steal! All in, it was a very enjoyable trip to Lantau island. It was a good opportunity for us to get away from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong and just to enjoy a quiet half a day in the countryside, recharging our batteries. I highly recommend a trip to Lantau island for the overall experience."

We just spent a week in HK and our trip to Lantau was a definite highlight.We started our day with an excellent dim sum brunch at the moderately-priced 3rd floor Maxim restaurant in City Hall (5 Edinburgh Place) with its bustling atmosphere and great view of the HK waterfront. Don't confuse it with the more formal dining room on the second floor.Then we walked over to the Outlying Islands Ferry Pier No. 6 (to the west of the Star Ferry) and took the 50-minute trip to Mui Wo on Lantau Island. From Mui Wo we took Bus 2 on a scenic, winding climb up to Ngong Ping where the Giant Buddha and Po Lin Monastery are located. It's a wonderful, serene atmosphere. After climbing the 259 steps (our daughter counted them) up to the world's tallest, seated, outdoor, bronze Buddha, we took in the monastery and enjoyed a vegetarian snack which is included in price of admission (HK$24).There's an excellent sounding hike down from the Ngong Ping described in the indispensible Hong Kong Tourist Board publication \"Hong Kong Walks\". But on the day of our visit the weather was sketchy and we opted instead to take bus 21 to the fishing village of Tai O. This turned out to be an inspired choice.Visiting Tai O is like looking in on old rural China -- at least it seemed that way to me. The village houses are rudimentary, built on stilts and made of tin. We walked from the busstop to the iron bridge and crossed to the main part of town, walking past tiny shops, simple restaurants and lots of stilt houses to Hau Wong Temple.Many of the doors were open and we glimpsed the modest homes of the villagers.Tai O is only a couple of hours from Hong Kong but it's a big step back in time. I would have loved to have eaten a meal in one of the restaurants on the main street, but we weren't sure of the bus and ferry schedules and didn't want to miss our connections.We took bus 1 back to Mui Wo and then the ferry back to HK, but you could also choose bus 11 to Tung Chung where the airport MTR can whisk you back to the city.All the transportation info you need is clearly posted in English as well as Chinese. Using the Octopus card to pay our ferry and bus fares saved a lot of hassle as buses don't give change.If you're looking for a day away from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong, Lantau Island is a perfect choice."
