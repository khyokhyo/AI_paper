Lots of local handicrafts, but also markets and stalls with lots of crystal and ceramic tiles and glass soda siphons. It looks like an amazing clear out of Art Deco houses.Go, really great fun, even in the rain as happened to us!"

The San Telmo Feria takes place on Sundays, and is a very nice walk from San Telmo, from the south, all the way to the Plaza de Mayo, with a stop at the Mafalda statue on Calle Chile in between. It has some interesting gift offerings and nice art, but don't expect anything too fancy or really worth spending too much in. Great for a Sunday morning visit."

While walking on the main pedestrian thoroughfare, wander around in parallel streets and blocks to see art murals on the walls and shops. Be careful with your belongings while walking in crowded areas. Can easily spend 4 to 6 hours in a day depending on your interest. Or just 2 hours for a quick jaunt. Be sure to visit Pasaje de la Defensa- the historic shopping area"

Loved going to the market in the morning to get fresh croissants and baguettes. Every thing you need is a short walk away. Sunday market is amazing. In my opinion the best place to stay when visiting BA."

            "review": "How to 'Do' San Telmo. San Telmo market is a must see. It runs every sunday from about 11am until about 5ish, 6ish 7 ish, depending on the stall holders!First of all, wear good shoes and have tons of cash with you. You can buy everything on this market. If you dont buy anything, then you need cash to pay all of the street entertainersI suggest that you don't go on a very hot day, the market covers 'one' street, and goes on for about 3km. Start at Plaza Dorrengo and just keep walikng !!If you are looking for a quick danse, look out for the 'old man with a hat.....' we found him, he is fantastic ;) near the PlazaI decided not to take children as i had heard about how busy it is. Yes its true, the streets are narrow with stall holders on both sides. Leave the kids behind and have fun on your own!!As the market packs away, head to Chacabuco block 900, -(possibly 942, 3 blocks away from the market) for a Tango lesson in a lovely old cultural centre with 2 great teachers. The lessons start about 17h30, and stay for a practise at this lovely early Milonga- costs 80 pesos per person. coffee and biscuits included :)At about 7pm head back to Plaza Dorrego for the public Milonga, grab some food and a beer and relax in the atmosphere of San Telmo. At 8pm grab your dancing shoes (or just a seat) and join in with the Milonga in the plaza.Stay as late as you like (hence the no kids advise!!)Didn't see any 'dodgey' characters all day/night, and had a fantastic day outThe only downside was our choice of carpark in the afternoon....it was 4 blocks off the main plaza and down a bit of a badly lit quiet side street---not a great idea walking back at midnight. SO i advise you to move your car at about 7pm into the side streets/ car park off the plaza, as they are well lit and LOTS of people around.Felt safe all day, except the dodgey 5 mins at midnight DO it... enjoy it....go back next Sunday.....;)"

Sunday is a big craft, music and market day and we were excited to go back. Many talented people offered everything from paintings and leather crafts to music and foods. There was also a huge antique area in a very interesting old building. It was a very interesting area to stroll in."

Some streets were filthy and I only saw a couple of nice buildings, with 'colonial architecture'. I was in BA during the week so I can't comment on the antiques market/fair. Also the weather wasn't great, for 75% of my trip, so that's probably coloured my view. I popped into some antique shops...the doors are locked so you have to knock be let in, and a couple of shop assistants seemed miffed that I didn't buy anything. I went to the Museum of Contemporary Art (MACBA) which I felt was a rip off at 60 pesos. The best part of San Telmo was by far Caf\u00e9 San Juan (on Avenida San Juan) which had delicious food. I wouldn't stay in San Telmo again- I think Palermo or Recoleta are much better areas."

The sunday fair is just ok, I actually prefer to visit the neighborhood on saturdays to avoid the crowd.

We got there around closing time so, unfortunately, weren't able to try food from any food vendors. It is a nice place to walk around and there are many stores and restaurants to check out.

Everything from antiques to food to clothes to souvenirs and jewelry etc. I actually found a few items worth bargaining for. And once I reached the end (at Av San Juan), there was no subway nearby, so I turned around and came back and realzied I had missed a lot on my first round through \u2013 likely due to the overwhelming selection and large crowds.Do not go souvenir shopping until you go to the market!

San Telmo is known for its antique shops and the dark wood caf\u00e9 s. The Plaza also has 5 bars which each have very good live entertainment each night. Keep in mind that in Argentina dinner is eaten about 9:30 and entertainment starts about 11pm. I would go to bed at 5 pm and get up at 8pm to go out. One night there was jazz, next night a live salsa band and the next night flamenco. Really, really good bands as well. One thing to mention, the people in Argentina love graffiti, they consider it to be a high art form, even tagging, so whn you head into San Telmo, you will see a lot of graffiti. I still am not walking alone at night in the neighborhood outside the plaza, I take a cab, but this is a very tourist friendly, warm and wonderful part of Buenos Aires."

Some of it looks like gang tags, but a lot of buildings are covered in beautiful art! My suggestion to the local homes and businesses, if you don't want a \"tag\" on your building, paint a mural. There seems to be a \"gentlemen's code\" among graffiti artists to avoid defacing another's work. The antique shops were plentiful. Cute restaurants and cafes scattered about and art galleries everywhere. Walking distance to the water, the Plaza Mayor, Florida Street and more. We will definitely stay in the neighborhood again and hope to be there for the weekend as there is tango on the streets and a huge market day on Sundays."

There is no problem with finding a place to eat dinner at midnight, or even 2am for that matter, and you'll find that not only are you not alone in this endeavor but that tables will be filled with young and old passionately conversing and consuming wine. Check out Moretti Bar for good beer, good people and good music. It's neighbour, Refuerzo has a big wine selection and good food. If you can find the market on Carlos Calvo, there is a coffee town that served the best coffee I had in Argentina.It's a good spot to stay in BA and although I've never been to New York, I feel it has a rival for the title of 'The City That Never Sleeps'."

Attention, on Sunday market, is very crowded and is people everywhere traying to cut your bag or small kids around trying to get your purse ,DONT BE NAIVE even kids are professionals, so go only with cash as the stores only accept cash most of them , and use a belt under your clothes as you will not feel the hands of kids when they are trying to get your purse. enjoy the place is great, and they normally use the tango shows on the streets of San Telmo to hit the targets,"

It has indeed some few charming streets, with cobblestones, antique shops and nice places to eat, aside from being very centric, however I found that this neighborhood may have seen better times. I was staying at a AirBnb in Peru avenue, and though it was generally quiet, it felt a bit unsafe at night as it was pretty solitary and the building were kind of old, vandalized and dirty. As well, streets tend to be covered on dog poop and thrash in some places.I recommend visiting the San Telmo market, which has interesting antiques and book shops, but aside of it I would rather stay at another neighborhood if I visit Buenos Aires in the future."

What makes that experience worth the visit is not the shopping (although some interesting souvenirs may also be found) but numerous live performances of local musicians, dancers and other street artists. The guitar player that performed on one of the corners was so great, that I purchased his CD and was listening to that music for weeks after coming back from Argentina. The tango dancers on one of the squares were as good (if not better) as those we saw in the famous Cafe Tortoni. We also had a chance to sit down over a beer and wine in one of the numerous open-air cafes, with a traditional jazz band playing live and a charleston dance school showing their skills and inviting audience to join them for dancing.What an atmoshpere!!"

If you are lucky enough to be in Buenos Aires on a Sunday - you must spend at least part of your day at the Feria de San Telmo (San Telmo Flea Market). Every Sunday, thousands of locals and tourists descend on the San Telmo area to walk street after street viewing the wares being offered by hundreds of vendors. There is a square where there are regular booths which sell strictly antiques, but as you walk the surrounding streets you will find crafts, souvenirs, clothing, food stands and more. Guide books tell you there are 270 stands - I think this refers to the actual market - but there are hundreds more on the surrounding streets.Besides for the many vendors selling from their street booths, there are brick-and-mortar galleries, antique shops and restaurants. Many of the buildings in this older area are themselves worthy of more than a casual glance for their wonderful turn-of-the-century architecture. Along the way you will pass musicians, singers and dancers performing in the street. One of the highlights for us was a wonderful tango performance. We arrived early (about 10:00 in the morning) and walked the entire length of the market area from Parque Lezama all the way down Defensa (street) to Plaza de Mayo (where you will find the Casa Rosada and the main cathedral).We were there for about five hours but you can either do it faster than we did or not cover as much ground and still get a feel for this unique and fun Sunday market.Between the antiques and crafts, the food and music - the Sunday San Telmo street market should definitely be on your \u201cdo not miss\u201d list for a visit to Buenos Aires.Note: Our concierge and our taxi driver both warned us to beware of pickpockets. Given how very crowded it can get - it seemed good advice."

I figured that an old Italian sector would certainly have great fruit and veg markets...... I was correct. What was unexpected was that my favourite Tango Venues were also to be discovered in this old and fascinating place.........Wonderful 10 piece orchestras and remarkable floor shows were easy to find and attend, not to mentioned the Tango generous and non judgemental well mannered local men. I extended my trip to three months and I'm planning another at the end of this year. The architecture was enchanting and not ever did I feel unsafe stepping out at night to Tango.On the weekends there is such a lovely friendly market at either side of Dorego Plaza and so many exquisite antique shops and at the end of all of it TANGO under the stars....I can't wait to be there again"

The barrio is a magnet for tourists largely because it touts itself as the birthplace of tango. This is only partially true, but it's good for business. Tourists come for the Saturday and Sunday markets in and around plaza Dorrego. In good weather or bad, it's mobbed. There's plenty of junk to browse at the stalls and you can find bargains. You have to haggle, and the dealers will never go as low as they can if you are obviously a tourist. I was born in Buenos Aires so I help out friends who come. Even so, I can't get the best prices if I am with visitors -- only when I am alone and can chat up the vendor. Sundays there's also a fair bit of music and some classic tango. I don't go too often because I don't like the hordes of tourists. The cafes around the plaza are all good, but not cheap. If you're not a local I wouldn't venture too far from the plaza on Sundays. It's a safer neighborhood than some, but you need to know what you are doing if you wander off the beaten path. Better to go on a weekday if you want to wander around. The shops are all open on weekdays but the market is not there, so there's people going about their daily business all around.. San Telmo is also legendary for its murals which are everywhere and constantly changing. The covered market is brilliant. You can get anything you want there from fresh meat and veg to antique clothing. There's also a ton of cheap eateries serving local specialties. You'll get home cooked dishes here which you won't recognize if you don't know about Argentine cooking. Wherever you are in san Telmo keep a tight grip on your bag or wallet. There are thieves everywhere."

I would recommend taking a seat round the edge of the square for a drink whilst the market packs up, then moving to the restaurant seating as it sets up in the square itself next to the tango dancing area. Anyone is welcome to join in the dancing and it attracts quite a crowd.Even when it isn't a market day there are indoor markets selling a wide range of bric a brac and souvenirs. The area feels safe too!"

We purchased old leather bags at the market at ridiculous low prices. We bought silver from the local vendors that were also dirt cheap. The artsy vendors, local craftsmen and warm people made this a memorable visit. Also, loved the craft beer from the local pub. Highly recommend a Sunday visit, (only day the fair is open.)"

Sunday- including Easter Sunday- Defensa, off of the Plaza de Mayo, a narrow cobblestone street lined on both sides with stalls selling decent leather belts with nice metal buckles ( bought 2 for under $30), but also the cute and colorful metal painted signs, drawings, socks, matte cups, and plastic junk, etc. The streets are packed from morning until almost 9 at night! We stopped at the San Telmo market (The Coffeehouse) for a lunch of a a variety of very good empanadas. Then we went on the Free Walks tour of the historic center, which I highly recommend. It starts at the Congress and ends at the Plaza de Mayo and the Casa Rosada, the Presidenial offices.In the evening, we went back into San Telmo and stopped for a \"picada,\" an assortment of cheese, olives, salami, ham, turkey, bread, and then later tried a \"submarino,\" which the Free Walks guide had suggested. This is a variety of hot chocolate: hot milk in which you dip a small chocolate bar, which melts into the milk. You can add extra sugar if you like this extra sweet. In some places, they also serve it with a churro ( think a 6 inch skinny long donut that's covered with sugar), which wasn't served where we stopped. Then we went to the milonga at the square, which begins around 8 every Sunday night. The milonga is a spot where the tango is danced by every day people. It was great, with many older couples truly fantastic. We left around 10, dancing out of San Telmo with a drum line group."

The San Telmo market and La Defensa handicrafts market are well worth your Sunday. The primary ST/Dorrego square area primarily has many, many antique dealers, but we also found some artisans and tango musicians and dancers in the mix. So much to look at and all about the cultural history of Argentina (clothes, phones, plates and cutlery, magazines, everything). For us, this was a nice atmosphere and certainly a great central point for where we chose our hotel, etc., but we really went nuts for the 3-kilometer-long handicrafts market that occupies La Defensa (street) adjacent to the square. Not only are there crafts on both sides of the pedestrian-only zone, but there are people selling homemade empanadas, churros, and sandwiches everywhere. The area smells like grilled meat since all the restaurants on the street are open, and women are literally walking by calling \u201cempanada\u201d with their small basket of homemade pastries. There is music and stuff to look at for miles. We worked very hard to walk the majority of the area before buying anything. What we discerned by walking the length was that some people were selling items that appeared mass produced but many were selling truly unique, handmade items that were well worth the money. We were able to get wallets that were just made by the seller, art pieces signed by the artist on the spot, hand printed goods, and all sorts of souvenirs that are great reminders of our trip to Argentina."

Found a great boutique jeweler that sells handcrafted gems with a wonderful Vinoteca across the street possessing an excellent selection of Argentine wines in a charming building. (Both are near the Antiguo Mercado.) I could have done without the huge \"antique\" market that felt more like one huge yard sale / swap meet but it's worth wending your way through the stalls to find the stage just to watch the Milonga dancers. If you're a legit antique lover, there are storefronts with antique dealers on Calle Defensa. I didn't explore any as I'm not a fan but per hearsay and the window displays, these stores are for the luxury shopper. We stopped at Mercadito Latino for a very good lunch where they served a variety of South American cuisine. We also explored the Pasaje de la Defensa which was a very attractive/atmospheric complex full of little boutiques. Don't forget to look-up as you stroll to admire the gorgeous historic buildings with it's character-filled details like sculptured dragons, wreaths, faces, and a few stained-glass windows. The neighborhood is on the \"gritty\" side, so keep an eye on your belongings and enjoy some of the few dilapidated areas as part of the neighborhoods charm.

We stayed for a full week in a lovely apartment on Peru, so I know of which I speak. The barrio was the first established in Buenos Aires and after spending just a little time there, you will see that it was once a center of wealth in BA's earliest days until it was quickly abandoned with the onset of a yellow fever outbreak. I will agree that San Telmo can seem a little sketchy, at first, but spend a little time walking the streets, having lunch, dinner, or a drink or coffee in the many cafes, and the faded charm of San Telmo will quickly come shining through. In fact, I highly recommend walking the neighborhood at night when it really shines. We did several times, after midnight, and never felt uncomfortable. Note that most tourist maps do not orientate to North. The interesting parts of San Telmo are the Streets Peru, Bolivar, Defensa, and Balcarse, which run North/South, and their cross streets between Defensa and Ave. San Juan (east/west). I don't recommend going west of Peru as there's really nothing there and that area is pretty run-down. And yes, the Market is a must if you are fortunate enough to be in town on a Sunday. All of Defensa is closed to cars for the market, but the best of it runs between Independencia and Plaza Dorrego. North of Independencia is good, too, just more congested. There is also the San Telmo market, open daily, which is an enclosed, full square block building with vendors of all types, inside, including some of the best coffee we had in BA at Coffee Town. While in BA, you MUST see a tango show and the one I recommend is in San Telmo called Taconeando (see T.A. reviews). It's an intimate venue with an excellent show that's not crazy-expensive like some of the tourist oriented tango shows. In fact, on the night we went, more than half the audience were locals and we were the only Americans there. Loved it! If we return to BA, San Telmo will again be our base."

But what you really want to explore are the antique shops, cafes and bars overflowing with locals and musicians. There's even dancing in the street! The main square is fabulous and you can sit under the huge trees sipping coffee or something a little stronger and savour the whole atmosphere"

There are no subways near this well known antique fair held only on Sundays. So we used a map and guide that suggested walking south from the Plaza Mayor and Pink House on Defensa Calle. . Immediately as we exited the plaza Mayor and the pink House we saw stalls on both sides of the streets for all sorts of crafts. No antiques. Our feet quickly noted the cobblestones and wore at our feet as we headed towards the San Telmo neighborhood. During the week this is an upscale convenient neighborhood On Sunday it is chaotic with crowds of locals and international tourists. leathergoods, wooden carving and other argentinine crafts croded beside tourist scarves, t-shorts and water vendors. Some restaurants have their own tango bands and people dance the tango. others have recordings and dance the tango seeking donations. as we approached the center of San Telmos we found the antiques and better quality goods and less tourist goods from China. leather jackets and boots abounded. WE felt the heat and sought water vendors. We grieved the abandoned church on our way. WE finally reached the park and sat to rest before finding our way back to the Pyramid . This is a memorable feria. it is not used goods or flea market it does have some nice restaurants in the middle of the activity."

During the night, it's supposedly a bit less safe, and basically everyone advised us to take a taxi. So we did.The only difficulty we encountered was walking with a child in a stroller. That was due to the very narrow sidewalks that were made of cobblestone, which made it very slow and difficult to push the stroller. But if you don't have a stroller, it shouldn't be an issue."

It was very interesting, and much safer than La Boca, for example, while having its own traditional charms. It also was not \"touristy\" at all in my opinion.There are some excellent shoe shops - not bargain shoe shops, but incredibly well made by hand, very good quality shoes in styles not easily found in North America. This is the place to splurge on leather good of any sort.As anywhere in Buenos Aires, you have to take reasonable precautions as robberies and pickpocketing are not unusual. Do not walk around wearing expensive clothing, accessories, jewelry, and displaying expensive tech like iPhones. Be discreet with your money, and leave most of it in your hotel safe except what you need for the day. Be familiar with the currency and what counterfeits look like otherwise you could be taken advantage of. I would not recommend walking here alone after dark at all, but I was fine alone during the day sticking to the main streets.It was one of the most charming neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires and a genuine pleasure to explore on foot."

This is where you will find fading architecture from the turn of the C19, arts, crafts, university students and the city's bohemian residents. Central is the glorious Mercado San Telmo - a fruit, vegetable, meat and antique market of enormous proportions. Visit the bario on a Sunday to catch the mile-long street market in Defensa. Stay for lunch at one of the plethora of street caf\u00e9s - try El Federal in Carlos Calvo; and take a cold beer with the tango dancers in Plaza Dorrego. If you are not in a rush, stay for supper at El Desnivel in Defensa, and indulge with the late night milonga at Maldita, Peru 571, to watch the live orchestra El Afronte."

The streets are well lit at night and women walk around safely on their own. Taxis are frequent in all streets.There is a police station with police coming and going all the time. There are offices, hotels, numerous restaurants, bistros, bars, wine bars, antique shops, bookshops, offices and many small supermarkets and food shops. There are major supermarkets on the major roads, a few short blocks away.In Plaza Dorada you can watch Tango dancers in the open air as you dine. On Sundays the Plaza hosts a large open-air market, where artists, among others, sell their wares.All in all an entertaining and varied part of Buenos Aires. I shall be back."

I love the old rundown palatial houses which have been modified into antique and craft shops, I love the old bars with the mix of locals and tourists. I think the area is colourful and vibrant but you do have to watch out for the usual scams. The squares will often get the tango buskers come along and hassle you with a hat for change and I also spotted a few unsavoury pick pockets around. It is one of those areas which has character but also its fair share of characters and so just be on your guard and wander around and soak up the atmosphere.

The residential buildings that line the streets are wonderful and each one has a character and a beauty of its own.There is music on street corners and a multitude of antique shops. You can also find a branch of Coffee Town (the best coffee and cheesecake in B.A.!!! inside the closed market). On Sundays there is a 'street market' and several blocks of artesian tables line the street with orange juice, empenada and choripan to keep you going. Also at the end of the market tango dancers do a show every half hour. These are all fun and worth a visit but these are not the best reasons to visit st telmo!! The Artesians and their wares are also available in many neighbourhoods and they are just as good, say, in the Recoleta park near the famous cemetry on Sundays. As for street tango everyday on the corner of the Recoleta park a group of tango dancers do a show for tips and Nadia and her partners can even arrange tango lessons by the hour!!!. So why go to St Telmo?? What makes St Telmo special is the flea market which is best seen on a week day! If looking through flea market stalls is your thing then find the hidden door to the St Telmo mercadona and walk into the Old Buenos Aires! There is all kind of stuff from old broaches and clip on earrings to silk nightgowns and dresses, I even found a pair of tango shoes (comfortable as someone has already worn it into shape and cheaper than anything you can find in the shops!)...The stall owners are friendly and approachable and we have had some wonderful conversations and purchases on every visit!"

The suburbs of the microcentro, La City and Puerto Madero are all within walking distance while Recolecta and Palmero are just a short metro ride away. It's has a plethora of cheap accommodation options although some sections are safer than others.One attraction not to be missed here is the Sunday markets which set up for around 1km along defensa street. Classically these Sunday markets are associated with the Plaza Dorrego but in modern times it seems that they have extended significantly down defensa street - a street that also features a number of antique stores. It's a great place to purchase souvenirs that are unique and not mass produced rubbish."

Indeed, it is an historic area that has many small shops of all descriptions and and interest.(also a great ice-cream store on a corner) The San Telmo market which had been suggested as a place of interest ran a little shy of its reputation. From our point of view if you have visited the market in Valencia Spain, then this one is pale by comparison. We had some very good coffee at Coffee Town located in the middle of the market and then left. We made our way back to Dorrego Plaza, located just minutes away and enjoyed a lovely breakfast sitting outside on the plaza. All small restaurants around the square have their outside seating areas under umbrellas. The sun can get very warm during their summer! The highlight for us was when 3 tango couples arrived and set up their music and 'floor' and started dancing the tango. It was so unusual for us to see this 'spontaneous' tango breakout. We were enthralled to say the least! We landed up spending the entire afternoon enjoying the ambience. From time to time we ordered a cold drink at our 'ringside seats'. Of course, after the end of several dances a hat was passed around by the dancers. A fifty peso bill (approx $4 ) was most appreciated. We repeated that 3 times that afternoon and took away unforgettable memories!!"

On the junction of Defensa and humbler to Primo (to the right) is an open area where you can see professional tango dancer in progress. This was a treat for me as one of the reason I wanted to come here was to see Argentine Tango. You can order a glass of beer and enjoy the dance. On the day I visited, an English girl named Karen was dancing (beautifully I must add) after the dance she came round for tips and we chatted for a bit. She told me if I really want appreciate tango, it's best to go to a milonga. Best advice I received in BA.She gave me the address of a milonga (humberto primo 1400) that was happening that night.She said the top tango dancing couple were performing that night and also one of the best orchestra was going to perform too. Best to get a cab to and fro. Of course, I went. This turned out to be the highlight of my trip to BA.The dancing couples - Young and old. Simply wonderful.The orchestra, just fabulous and the pros. Perfection.This show was a one off , but I think the venue is used for weekly milongas. It is a far better experience than the tango dance and dinner venues dotted around BA.it only cost 100 pesos to get in. WARNING ALERT: have a fan with you as it can get really hot in the milonga.If you read this and see Karen dancing, please encourage her and tip generously.I love SAN Telmo, it is a wonderful place. As I said, it best to walk round and just take it. Highly recommended."

Ok it's touristy but part of the objective was to dance tango in local Milongas and buy new tango shoes and it's a good centre. The first thing we noticed was how much the infrastructure had deteriorated since last time. 5 years ago it was possible to walk along the pavement in high heels. Not now. You'd break your ankle. You have to take your shoes with you and change there. Get ever so slightly off the beaten tourist trail and there are a lot more people sleeping on the streets - even walking along the main road opposite Puerto Madero. Having said that there was a great deal more city police on the street so as long as you stick to the main streets it's probably OK but you do have to know where you're going and be wary. The other thing to note is that new year is not the best time for a visit. Pretty much everything is closed. All the tango shops (except VB on Independencia) and even many of the restaurants. We had real difficulty finding somewhere to eat on New Year's Day. IF there's a next time I will probably stay somewhere else"

But replacing the passports, drivers license, car keys, etc etc. is now your problem. You won't find the discarded bag. Don't bother looking. Report it to the police. The number of reports might generate additional resources to the problem, but realistically, your stuff is absolutely gone. Take note of this... security cameras capture most of these \"petty crimes\", but the police do not own the cameras and due to bureaucracy, rarely get access to the footage. So u are on your own. If your hand or eyes are not on your bag, even if it is right next to you, it will be gone. People had their things stolen from between their legs, under the chair, between their chairs. You must consider that any and every street vendor is in on the rouse as well. Enjoy yourself, but be smart. According to my informal assessment at the police station, every 5-10 minutes, during the Sunday flea market, a bag is stolen. Do not let it be yours!"

There are awesome bars to stop off on for much needed refreshments; the Bar Britanico, La Poesia are particularly recommended. There is an engaging Latino atmosphere throbbing through these streets.

A lot of fun, but bring your negotiating skills as there a very few prices posted and I got the impression that bargaining was the order of the day. Along Defensa was a good place for picking up some souvenirs. Plaza Dorrega had some really good music when we first got there, and then it changed into a number of couples sequentially showing off their tango skills, though I'm not sure anyone was crowned a winner. All in all a great place to spend a few hours on a Sunday afternoon."

But since 1897, Santelmo has been home to the oldest flea market in Argentina, Mercado Santelmo. When we first went there in 2005 it resembled a square block of national attic--selling everything from old espresso machines to 1950s movie posters to anvils and blacksmith tools to wonderfully crafted facons, the traditional sheath knives of the gauchos. When we last visited in 2013 we found that many of the spaces have now been taken over by contemporary clothing and souvenir shops (GENUINE Argentine crafts made in China), but there are still enough of the traditional tiendas del Mercado to make it a worthwhile visit."

There is a lot to see, and I do recommend it. Live music is always happening, and a street tango show happens right in the middle of the plaza. Beautiful to see. If you love antiques, this is a treasure of a place. I just like different and unique jewelry and pieces of art, and I found both kinds to bring back home. You can also find inexperience nice souvenirs. If you can, try to find Fulco, a beautiful stand in the middle of the plaza \u2013 his stand was very close to the tango area when we visited. Mr. Fulco's art literally stands out through the box-like frame barely containing each piece. Parts of the scenery and characters jump forward in a combination of shadow box and diorama techniques. The vibrant colors of each scene and palpable personality bestowed upon each figure within not only contribute to the depth. They draw each viewer into the colorful details including Fulco's signature \"kioscos\" or newsstands, which appear in many of his works."

I felt safe staying there for the four days of our stay and we absolutely LOVED walking around, all the wonderful restaurants, coffee houses and bars. The people were fantastic and the Sunday market was incredible, even in the rain, especially with the music, unique vendors, and the conversion of a parking lot into Parilla for choripan sandwiches. DELICIOUS and CHEAP! Highly recommend the neighborhood.

On Sundays, this otherwise ordinary 2-mile long avenue that stretches from Plaza de Mayo right into the heart of San Telmo becomes one of the loveliest street markets you can imagine, both because of the bohemian atmosphere of San Telmo and because of the \"different\" stuff sold along the alley. Stands of souvenirs, antiques, crafts and clothes alternate each other in a lively environment, interrupted quite frecuent\u00f2ly by live music and tango exhibitions. The best example is an 80-year-old couple who perform the world famous dance while some younger guy plays the live music. The borough is packed with restaurants, pubs, bars, souvenir and atique stores at every corner; and if you plan to stay here for just a day or two then you'll really have a hard time to pick the restaurant where you wanna have lunch or dinner."

The market itself had a wide array of items - some cool and creative, others a bit weird (and dare I say it, ugly!), but it was huge fun to walk around and discover the stalls, see the people and to eventually end up at the market square Plaza Dorrego where there are live 'tango' performances (as part of a marketing exercise from the the tango schools and clubs). Sit at one of the many cafes around the square and have a cold beer while watching the hustle and bustle of the market and the people that come there.It's a great area to hang around or to stay.

We bought several pieces of art and a handmade knife. Some local incense, leather belts. There was street music, and entertainers, and local food. Vendors were informative, helpful and patient. It was a wonderful enchanting way to spend a Sunday. Most markets are not so original but this one is. Walk thru the original Selmo Market, it is full of antiques and great food.

In peak season you will navigate the pedestrian-only blocks moving shoulder to shoulder nearly the entire time. Pick-pockets are a known risk so plan accordingly. Also be aware that pricing may be variable. If something isn't marked with pricing, there's a good chance that the price will depend on how much of a tourist you seem to be (higher prices).

You can start by having a continental breakfast in one of the old and traditional coffee shops around San Telmo Square. Then go for a walk around the neighborhood where you'll see very old buildings, some of them almost 200 years old, churches and of course cobble stone streets. You can have lunch in a traditional restaurant and then watch people in the square and corners dancing tango, singing tango, painters working in the street. A lovely atmosphere. The shows are for free. You'll love San Telmo, a must in Buenos Aires."

The streets are closed from Plaza Dorrego to Plaza de Mayo down 10 blocks of Defensa street with temporary booths lining the streets (plus Plaza Dorrego is full of booths). We started at Plaza de Mayo, but you could start anywhere along the route (and I kind of wish we had started at Plaza Dorrego). There were lots of Argentinian crafts, art, handiwork, food...as well as antiques which is what I was looking for. They also had street performers and a couple performing the Tango. There is also a good weekend market in Recoleta - it's smaller but has more arts and crafts (we did that one the following Saturday). We had 3 people in our group...so felt safe walking to the Galerias Pacifico (only place to convert cash on a Sunday), then to the Plaza de Mayo and Plaza Dorrego...and back to the Hilton in Puerto Madero. This was a great walk...but long (probably 7-8 miles total). You could also take taxi's. Either way, be sure to wear comfortable shoes!"

In 2008 we DID come down here on a Sunday........and perhaps once again in 2012.We actually took the bus to San Telmo yesterday to go to the BA Museum of Contemporary Art on San Juan Avenue. Due to the elections, the museum was closed.SO......starting at San Juan and Defensa at around 4:30 PM.....we did the \"Defensa Walk\". The streets were more than congested: LOTS of people.........the middle of the street was an accident waiting to happen: SO MUCH cracking, you really had to watch your step or break an ankle.........and don't forget the fresh dog poop!........and except for a few stands with quality leather purses....the handcraft was underwhelming.And yes....there were lots of \"antique\" stands......for locals? tourists?There were some musicians on the street......THE best group being Negra Candela at San Juan and Defensa. By the time we reached Defensa and Belgrano we had enough......walked down the hill....and picked up a #130 on Paseo Colon back to our ap't.In retrospect......if you are a tourist with little time.......go to Recoleta on a Saturday or Sunday. IMHO a much better experience. The BEST of all: FERIA MATADEROS: much more authentic. Actually, wandering Defensa and surrounding streets is much more satisfying on a Thursday,Friday or Saturday.But I do remember that: Different strokes for different folks........so have fun wherever you go."

This is a funky - but fun - neighborhood with lots of places to look at for free like the antiques fair on the weekends, the open air markets, the sunday night tango dance in the plaza. there's lots of little stores to buy groceries at/practice your Spanish. It is close to the subway and bus routes, and , if you are a good walker, many other parts of town. At night it gets real wild, with the happenin bars, and can be dangerous, so you have to stay alert. - the sidewalks are disgusting, so stay alert when walking around or you could fall on something horrible."

Chile street has a bunch of good places and a shady venue. Street musicians, mimes, and an antique section in the small park at Defensa and Humberto. In the rear of it, watch the tango dancers in the evening. First a show then the locals dance. Try if you dare. Go back another day to stroll through the stores that you can't see during the fair. And if you're interested in BA history, take the tour at El Zanjon--a renovated home with exposed underground tunnels. Great history lesson of San Telmo and BA."

San Telmo for it's own is a nice old place to visit, especially on Sunday, where a Feria is held.Tango in the streets and many stalls selling used items and antiques.Although it is also a place where tourists are a target for scams.BEWARE: My husband was targeted TWICE in 3hrs. time by the Bird Poop Scam.Being always aware of our surroundings, fortunately,we were able to save our belongings.The first time, my husband was sprayed with the so called bird poop, a man approached us with a kleenex wanting to help clean up.My husband did put down his back pack on the floor but I snatched it up and held it tight. We were at the corner of Libertador and Independencia.At this point the man shouted to us that there was a McDonald near the gas station, where we could clean up in the bathroom upstairs.Here, back home a McDonald has always been a safe place where we bring our kids, so we thought nothing of it and went. The bathroom was upstairs, very few table and very dirty. My husband put down his back pack on one of the tables and went in the bathroom to clean up. I was standing right next to the table, had my hat in my hands and was thinking if I should put my hat down on the dirty table. At the corner of my eye I saw a movement, immediately I looked at my husbands back pack and in it's place was a different one!! I turned around to see a man running down the stairs holding OURS. I grabbed his, through it at him and grabbed ours away from him, yelling, \" This is yours and this is mine!!\" I yelled so loud he ran away , my husband came running out of the washroom and another gentleman who was reading a newspaper, shook his head saying that these people were not Argentinians but Colombians. Anyway I was glad to have been quick enough to have saved our back pack which contained 2 cameras, condo keys,a watch etc. These two were working together and the second man was waiting for us in the McDonald.The second time, my husband was sprayed at the corner of Independencia Av. and Balcarce St. very near also to the same MacDonald. This time, he yelled at the man telling him he was not going to the McDonald to wash up where his friend was waiting for us.So, be very careful when you go to San Telmo, enjoy the day there but BEWARE of the Bird Poop Scam."

I had heard about this famous antiques and craft market before, but I thought it was limited to the small Plaza Durango that I had previously visited. Oh how wrong I was. This enormous affair stretches for several blocks down Calle Defensa in San Telmo and is covered with an amazing variety of things for sale. Souvenirs, antiques, hippie handicrafts. You name it, they have it. Many are locally made too. I got a wallet made from old food packaging with collaged images of ancient Egyptian mummification on the front. Very unique. Although immediately after I saw a vintage street sign I really wanted. Only bring as much cash as you want to spend, because it's likely you will spend it all. Be sure to watch out for the blind guy who bumped into my sister and reached for her purse. Not everybody there is making money honestly.On other days, San Telmo still has a few stalls in Plaza Durango, but it's better known for it's cobblestone streets, chic restaurants and turn-of-the-century architecture. A great place to go explore, shop, eat and soak in the atmosphere of this historic neighborhood in Buenos Aires. To get here, take the metro (Subte) to San Juan and walk over to Calle Defensa. Alternatively, you can go to Plaza de Mayo and walk down Defensa from there."

Excluding of course Palermo and Recoleta.In general I think Buenos Aires is a fairly dirty city and one must be ever mindful of the ever present dog droppings on the sidewalks but perhaps as a result of the general bohemian attitude the streets in San Telmo are dirty and the smell of urine and dog feces was even more noticeable than in other parts of Buenos Aires.The Sunday arts fair on Calle Defensa in San Telmo is a must see but one visit was enough for me and watching the amateur Tango dancers each evening and weekends at the Plaza was a good way relax."

One vendor actually got mad when we questioned her \"ivory\" frame, as we had seen the exact thing in many other stalls. A reputable dealer downtown told us they were Bakelite (one of the first plastics). If you duck into some of the old homes where the courtyard space is rented out, you can find special goodies - Maria Mateos is one such place.

I would not want to come here at night, unless on a guided tour. The multi-coloured houses are iconic, and the many bars/bistros are very much targeted at the tourists. Many have a demonstration of the Tango, to which you are encouraged to 'contribute', particularly if you are sitting at the tables. Walking through the area will lead onto Puerto Madero, which is similarly geared up to the tourists. Bars/bistros abound."

Atmosphere great bargains, food/drinks and music...don't buy from the first stall! Plaza Dorrego after 5pm turns into a Tango lovers paradise, not bad. San Telmo is also great on other days when the market isn't on with less people. Like any part of BA be vigilant with your belongings, we didn't have any issues but we were robbed that next day at the Retiro bus station. Argentina is still on my 'must revisit' lists. It is an amazing place! Best Tango teacher is located in San Telmo - Alejandro Puerta, professional, knowledgable and talented."

With the small cobbled streets, the old mansions and merchants' houses, some derelict and other refurbished, graffiti, street music and the Sunday feria, it has an artistic and historic atmosphere combining a quite european-looking environment with the latin vibe. Must see if you are in Buenos Aires and a convenient place to stay during your visit, as it is not far from the centre, the metro is 10-15mins walking distance and has some cafes, restaurants and bars. Do some research on where exactly to stay as some streets are more deserted late at night (e.g. on Calle Defensa and close to Plaza Dorrego is a very good location)"

Besides, at the end the free tango-milonga on the square Dorrego. In the mean time go to Defensa and San Juan, just around the corner of the square, to listen to a ska and reggae group. Another great music event: the tango groups playing in the Pasaje San Lorenzo and the one on Humberto Primo. Drink Colombian coffee of the guy walking and selling delicious Colombian coffee. Or eat a empanada or vegetarian cake of the many sellers on street. Negotiate price if you want to buy something on the market. Dont's: the sellers of \"souveniers\". Most of them horrendous in shape and form. And very expensive. Got better to buy souveniers to the Feria de Mataderos. And the sellers of antiquary on the Plaza Dorrego itself: crap being sold very expensive. Skip also any of the coffee places around the Plaza Dorrego: all places to get ripped off as a tourist."

There was an incredible energy, the streets came alive with art, pop up markets, live music and tango. Slightly more rustic and less fancy pants than Palermo but full of character. If you're a food lover you will love San Telmo, every street is filled with cafes, restaurants, bakery's and bars and all extremely reasonably priced. If you haven't already, research the 'Blue Dollar' before going, it could save you money. The antique markets on Sunday are a must see!"

It seems like different places become one in a single city. I say: YOU\u00b4RE RIGHT! The first Buenos Aires has many satellite towns united by rail, and with the passing of time these villages became part of the city.The original Buenos Aires includes San Telmo, a neighbourhood located very near the Government House and it has centuries-old buildings. During the week it doesn\u00b4t seem a great attraction, but on weekends San Telmo literally explodes with local craft, music and street dancing shows, people offering typical dishes and its main attraction: the sale of antiques.Many celebrities like Madonna o Michael Jackson bought one or many of this ancient stuff during their stay in this country. This stores has a wide palette of prices. San Telmo also offer good and affordable gastronomy, and a great diversity of shows, like Tango at the VIEJO ALMACEN restaurant, or modern music at LA TRASTIENDA theater.It is good to give the pleasure of letting ourselves be carried away to the galleries of ancient houses of immigrants (named conventillos) and enjoy rare objects that can be found in little stores or street sellers. This place is tourist friendly, so you can walk safetly for the streets.I recomended to visit San Pedro Telmo church, in front of the first Buenos Aires Medical school (now an elementary school), The Russian Orthodox Church and the Lezama Park. Near to San Telmo you may visit Madero harbour (Puerto Madero), a beauiful and quoted sector of Buenos Aires. Every places has public access, so you don\u00b4t have to pay to stay, except private spectacles. Enjoy!!!"

San Telmo also has antique shops, bars, a permanent market and a weekend street market on every Sunday, which stretches far down the street. However, the large number of tourists in the area on Sundays attracts thieves. During the day we were molested on three (!!!) different occasions by thieves whose trick involves spraying you from behind with a foul smelling concoction meant to resemble bird poo. They then helpfully draw your attention to it and pretend to help wipe you down with the newspaper or paper towels that, very conveniently, they happen to be carrying. Since we'd read about this scam, they didn't steal anything, but by third attempt to spray us we were rather annoyed.The rest of our stay there was uneventful, however. We went out to dinner each night without any concerns for our safety, taking no more than the precautions usual in any city."

For some reason, our transfer guide had advised us not to stay there past 5-6pm, stating that some of the nearby side roads can be a bit dangerous. We took her advice as it was our first time in Argentina but in hindsight, I think we probably missed out by doing this as I think this is when more of the locals come out, more of the street dancing etc happens - it certainly didn't feel dangerous or threatening in any way when we were there but perhaps there is more that I'm not aware of.The market itself was fabulous - so buzzing, lively, crowded but not in an unpleasant way - there is something for everyone with a good mix of antiques, food, jewellery, handicrafts. There are places to sit down and eat and drink eg. we stopped for some traditional street food in a makeshift cafe with some live music. It has a real feel-good sense about it. We had read a lot of reviews about watching out for pickpockets.We therefore took precaution with this - my husband padlocked his rucksack and we saw many men carrying their rucksacks on their fronts. I held onto my bag at all times and just took general common-sense precautions and we were fine. The roads are all quite pedestrianised with cobblestones - this is fine but choose your footwear accordingly - I went in just flip flops and found them a bit uncomfortable on the stones.Don't expect everyone to speak English (not that they should, I just wish my Spanish was a bit better!) but we saw a few tourists really struggling to order food in English from street vendors - if you're going to come to a lovely local market like this, it'll help to be equipped with a few basic phrases.What's nice as well is that people don't really hassle you too much if you do just want to browse, which is something that can be a real problem in other parts of the world so I found that quite refreshing here.I'm so glad we did this on a Sunday in Buenos Aires - it's great fun and a wonderful place to buy gifts or souvenirs of traditionally made items."

Everything from antiques, to leather goods, to street performers, to a myriad of local handcrafted goods and jewelry and that's just in the market that goes on for blocks and blocks and blocks! Then there are the shops on the streets that start opening up around noon and the side streets that lead to other established markets with everything from meat to produce, pastries and cheeses. Plenty of restaurant options all around...great people watching as the locals seem to enjoy the social aspect the market as much as the tourists do the spectacle of it all!

Also interesting old colonial architecture. However, in spite of what we thought was a perfect place to hide our phone....it was pickpocketed at the far end (away from the square) of the flea market. Looking back, there was a group of young women blocking the center of the street, who didn't seem to want to move, forcing people to squeeze by...and that's likely where the dastardly deed occurred. Getting robbed can happen anywhere (although first time for us while travelling), but one thing that troubles us was the total lack of police presence in an area known for theft from tourists. We saw police everywhere during our 2 1/2 weeks in Argentina - in the smallest of towns, in safer areas like Recoleta or smaller cities including Salta or Mendoza...having a few officers on foot patrols would at least demonstrate that Buenos Aires takes crime seriously. We're rating this a \"3\" as the market is quite fun and interesting, but watch your stuff."

If you don't mind crowds, go on the weekend and catch the street markets. You might even catch live tango music on the street, ( Fernandez Fiero are not your average tango orchestra, they look more like a rock band) and the odd dance performance too. A word of caution about safety though, crime is on the rise, where it used to be harmless pick-pocketing, it is getting increasingly violent. ( no doubt to the economic situation). You will see armed police on some street corners again, (like it was 10 - 15 years ago), especially in areas frequented by tourists and the wealthy Portenos."

We absolutely loved going into the many different antique stores and exploring. If you are an antiquer, like us, you will be in heaven and we found many, many things we only wished we could take back to home with us. After a stroll and a stop at the penitentiary museum, we stopped for lunch at the plaza, which was excellent. Overall, the area didn't offer much beyond the two streets and definitely be careful of pickpockets. However, the area had life and was a great experience. After our first visit to San Telmo, we will definitely be going to the Sunday market on our next stay in Buenos Aires."

On one particular Saturday, there was a community BBQ with great live music; that really lifted my spirits as I was particular homesick and little bit lonely on that day :) Had some amazing pasta at a restaurant I can\u2019t remember and was served by the kindest old man at some quite corner side cafe. I also picked up some great vintage clothes at one of the many second hand stores, and some out of print English books on art, communism and Picasso. I would go back to BA, just to spend time in this fantastic place! Of course you need to be vigilant since pick pockets and petty theives abound, but that is what makes San Telmo a part of the real BA, with all its grandeur and troubles."

Around 8pm the locals relax from the weekend crowds and tango in the Plaza Dorego. Young and old mix to share in the joy of a well danced tango under the stars. This isn't an event staged for tourists, rather it is a local and very personal evocation of what tango means to Argentinians. The joy and beauty of these dancers speak volumes about the beauty of the Argentinian soul. On other corners of the Plaza informal groups of drummers beat out rhythms that combine African and South American themes and dance in the streets. The scene is eclectic and entirely real...it reminds me of similar scenes I witnessed in Havana. Pure joy, pure emotion, pure enjoyment for us."

In about half an hour you reach the main shopping street.On Sundays the flea market seems to stretch from Florida in the city centre all the way to San Telmo and out the otherside. A relaxed stroll can take a few hours, especially if taking in all the stallls, shopping and antique arcades en route.Refreshments are available from the many restaurants, bars and cafes along the way, as well as from the mobile street vendors plying their wares amongst the crowds.Definitely a must for a relaxed, but interesting shopping expedition on a Buenos Aires Sunday."

I was told to be careful because it was filled with thieves, pick pockets and all sorts, fortunately, my visit to san telmo (with a bunch of African friends) was devoid of such nasty experiences.

San Telmo is part of the first Buenos Aires, where inmigrants choosed to stay when they went down from the ships they were arriving due to the proximity with the harbour. Te place stayed similar to what it was in 1920\u00b4s, and now is full of nice bars and tipical grills, but the main atraction of this neighborhood is Defensa Street where you will be able to find marvelous antiques and take a look to Buenos Aires past. It\u00b4s a really nice place to walk during morning (not to early) or afternoon."

But after the yellow fever explosion of 1871, that group started moving to the Northern parts of the city, leaving this region to immigrants and middle-class people. It was then when it took it\u00b4s present day characteristics. Lacking conservation from private owners and from the town government, this quarter retains interest anyway, and you can here, in some places, imagine the Buenos Aires of the first half of the XX century. A lot of antiques shops are concentrated here, some of them very interesting, though expensive. And an extremely attractive antiques fair is held on Sundays. Be very careful with your bags and pockets, try to look as local as possible and avoid public concentrations (for example, where street performers are acting). Do not show money in the streets, specially dollars or euros!"

The weekend market was also interesting and I enjoyed spending an hour or so there looking at all the stalls. I have heard/read about San Telmo being dangerous. I have only been there during the day so I can't speak for what happens at night but this wasn't my experience of San Telmo at all. Normal travelling precautions such as wearing your backpack on your front at the markets (as most people do all over Buenos Aires anyway) and keeping your bag/pack in your lap rather than putting it on the floor under a table should mean you avoid any petty theft incidences. Certainly don't let the horror stories about travellers belongings getting pinched stop you from spending an afternoon here."

Its bohemian charm makes it an ideal place for thinkers and artists, leaving each day to be discovered for inspiration. Placed in the oldest part of the city, hosts many decadent buildings and preserves the magic of a city that lives of its nostalgia. Day and night it\u2019s lively and on Sundays delights the visitors as well as the ciudadanos with the famous San Telmo feria: a market where live music, street artists, flea market stalls and artisanal ones join together for a big party that lasts all day. The downside, but also a reality check, is that the barrio is not as well looked after as some other richer neighbourhoods of the city: it is normal to see people living in the streets and smell every sort of smells on the way. Still, this also makes it ideal to live Buenos Aires in its full, as it doesn\u2019t leave much space for hypocrisy. I was happy to live there and I miss it dearly."

The Plaza Dorrego antiques market on Sunday is crazy, heaving and liveley, with a raffish atmosphere. My friend nearly lost the contents of her bag to a pleasant looking middle aged couple, who were also pickpockets. There's tango music and buskers everywhere. One old couple have been busking there for years and must be in their eighties. Young bands of musicians play with gusto.On weekdays, Plaza Dorrego is completely different and much quieter. There are lots of fabulous antique shops and a permanent antique fair there. The area is full of bars, boutiques, cafes, shoe shops and milongas (tango dance events), tango houses, hotels and hostels. Many people say that it's the \"real\" Buenos Aires, whatever that means. I enjoyed my two weeks here.Is there a down side? Definitely. It has a seedy atmosphere, which worsens at night. Groups of boys and young men sit in doorways, or lean against the big rubbish bins in the street. I was never menaced, but often felt uncomfortable walking back to my hotel late at night, sometimes leaving events earlier than I would have liked, rather than walk back alone at a later hour. My hotel was locked, day and night and I had to be buzzed in. Other hotels do the same. Buildings are grimy, covered in graffiti and in a shocking state of repair, but there are some attempts to fix things up. Generally though, I was always surprised to see any evidence of repairs anywhere.The sidewalks and streets are quite dangerous. Gaping holes and piles of rubble appear without warning. Lots of loose paving and cobbles in bad condition can make walking a trial. My friend fell in the street due to the bad state of repair and was lucky not to have been hurt badly. As I have commented before, I'm not convinced that a place needs to be grimy, dilapidated and menacing to be \"real.\" After two weeks, I was over San Telmo and decided that for me, it was a place which should be visited several times, but that there are nicer places to stay, even if they are a bit raffish too. My last week was spent in Recoleta, which was a huge relief. The contrast was like going from the ridiculous to the sublime."

A mixture of late 19th century and early 20th century architecture give this area an eclectic mix. There are now major renovations being done and the area is improving dramatically.There are many nice restaurants in the area with outside terraces to enjoy a meal with a cold beer or a wonderful bottle of wine.Come to the area on Sunday's when there is a market on Defensa and an antique fair on the square where there is also ample opportunity to watch tango being danced if you're not into going to a tango dinner show.Visit the Mercado de San Telmo with a mix of produce and meat and antiques being sold."

Be sure to head to Plaza Dorrego, which seems to be the \"heart\" of the market, and it's nicest area. You can sit outside at one of the funky restos lining the square. And in the square there is usually tango dancing."

I used to let it to tourists and it was obvious that they liked the area. Porte\u00f1os are divided about San Telmo; it is a bit drab if you fancy ultra modern skyscrapers rather than beautiful colonial houses and cobbled streets. San Telmo has a community of artist and bohemian people that appeals to yonger and more adventurous types. On Sundays there is a flea market in Dorrego Sq. that now extends throughout neighbouring streets. It is chock o'block with tourists and it's definitely the best time to go as through traffic stops until 8pm so you can wander the different stalls to your heart's content. Some local eccentric characters are always there, living statues, musicians etc. The atmosphere is informal to say the least. There are also many antique shops that are seriously eager to accept your credit cards, cash or whatever you want. If you have time wander inside the market, it was built in 1907 and the shops there ell knick- knacks, good meat and fruit and veg that are fresh and taste real, unlike the veg you buy from a supermarket. Have a coffee in a small stall in the centre, it would blend coffees from various countries if you ask them nicely. Not many tourists go in as it's perhaps not well advertised but it nearly occupies a block so there are various entrances. That's my top tip for tis, if you fancy a tango there are people dancing in the square in the afternoon, don't be shy as nobody would bat an eyelid if you can't dance."

I recommend starting your Sunday by touring Casa Rosada first and then from Plaza de Mayo head up Defensa all the way to Plaza Dorrego. The Sunday market stalls start on Defensa right off the plaza and it's nice to start this far north because it's not nearly as crowded as it gets southbound closer to the square.

In the evening, the crowds shift to where the shopping, eating areas are, and as the hours get later, the streets empty of people except for the litter left behind.The Sunday flea market is a big weekly event if you're in the area. I found it tiresome after walking for a while, it seems to go on and on and it's very crowded, slow moving and not so easy walking on their uneven streets. There are some interesting things to browse at, the food the vendors at the flea market provide simple, tasty, inexpensive foods.Watch your valuables, as in crowded areas and distractions like watching entertainers could be the distraction pickpockets need. See those who carry their backpacks on the front, they're probably victims of pickpockets.A few places will entice customers with a Tango dance, but will tease you to stay till they think they have a large crowd before the performers will dance, and afterwards go around asking for tips. One restaurant in the area near the museums have dummies outside have a good Tango show but their food isn't all that good and is on the pricey side.I didn't think of it at the time, we were leaving for the airport that day, should have stocked up with food snacks from that vendor, as the food prices at the airport are way more expensive.It's worthy of a visit. Lots to see, lots to do, can be expensive, the money meter can run fast here. Restaurants are plentiful, but few are exceptional to the palate at any price."

However stretching out from the main square is Defensa street and the artisan goods along this street were varied and interesting. There are great boutiques along the street as well. If you are peckish, don't hesitate to buy an empanada from the vendors selling near the intersections - quite tasty. Or, enjoy a refreshment at the pub that is located kitty-corner from the main square. We purchased a Yerba Mate cup that was hand decorated and some funky jewelry - or which both, there were many to choose from. Wear comfortable shoes because if you meander along, it takes a long time to travel along the few blocks. Also, be mindful of pickpockets - they are always around. If you have time for only one market, we enjoyed the Recoleta market better, but the outlying businesses and restaurants are extremely overpriced."

I'm not an antiques person but if you are, San Telmo is a slice of Argnetinian heaven. They definitely have some cool stuff in the stores lining the outdoor market.

San Telmo is the smallest neighbourhood in Buenos Aires.Originally it was inhabited by people working at the port. Later on, the Jesuits founded the Our Lady of the Rosario Church. After that, rich families occupied the place, but the 1871 yellow fever epidemic made them leave the neighbourhood. It was then when the old beautiful houses began to be rented to the arriving European immigrants. These people used to live in what is known as conventillos (big houses whose bedrooms where hired separately to different families who shared some common areas, such as the kitchen, the bathroom, the yard, etc) (Similar to the idea of a Hutong in China).A long time passed and by 1970 Plaza Dorrego was created with its characteristic Antique Fair (Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.). There are many places to visit when in San Telmo: Buildings from the XIX and XX century around the main square, Casa M\u00ednima, built by freedmen following the 1813 abolition of slavery in Argentina, Defensa Street, Humberto I Street \u2013 The Jesuit Church of Betlem., Mafalda Statue (on the corner of Chile and Defensa), Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Bel\u00e9n Church, The Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, San Pedro Church, The Prison Museum (Museo Penitenciario), San Telmo Market, Pasaje La Defensa (ex Casa de los Ezeizas on 1179 Defensa Street), a typical criolla house built in 1880, and one of the best kept examples of a house of those times with two floors and bedrooms around a lovely garden). Make sure you visit one of the old houses (of which Pasaje La Defensa is an example), now turned in Art Galleries, antique shops or commercial galleries. Luckily, you will be able to see street performers and Tango dancers on the cobblestone streets of this lovely neighbourhood.Restaurants and bars in San Telmo are not that expensive so it would be a good opportunity to have something there and relax, while you feel the nostalgic atmosphere of Buenos Aires\u2019 bygone days!A good website to take into account: http://www.feriadesantelmo.com/menu.htm"

If you come here just as a tourist passing through, San Telmo can seem like nothing more than a typical tourist spot with old churches, old buildings and tons of antique stores. Now I've lived in San Telmo with my girlfriend for two months, and we both really love it here. There are so many great bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s surrounding the place, and really get that \"Buenos Aires feeling\" when you spend your day walking though the old streets, enjoying some of that terrible beverage that passes for coffee here at a nice caf\u00e9, or having some drinks or a couple of beers in one of the many unique and original bars found around here.There are also a lot of cool clothing shops around here, with unique clothing.What I love about San Telmo is that you are not too shielded from what is the reality for many people in this country. You see young students, old people, poor people, wealthier people and tourists together. The sunday fair in Defensa is really nice, but very crowded. Here you can buy everything from chili paste, clothes, shoes, leather belts and art to tacky articles and gifts. What is a real treat though is the indoor Mercado (market). Here you find a lot of the things you find in the sunday feria, slightly cheaper and without the extreme crowd. And most of the antique shops with tons of different things are mostly open every day. If you hit the indoor mercado, be sure to have a cup of coffee at Coffee Town, the small \"pavilion\" in the center. They are one of the few places in Buenos Aires with good coffee.San Telmo is also a place where you can cacth some decent tango shows while having a glass of wine or a meal.The atmosphere in this barrio is something you really should experience while in Buenos Aires, and try to give it a couple of days to walk around here and try some different caf\u00e9s, restaurants and bars. It's as great as Palermo, slightly cheaper and with a more neo-bohemian crowd than the rich kid hipster crowd."

One thing I noticed is that the stores close to the main square have a lot of beautiful leather goods, but the prices are 1/3 higher than the exact same items I saw in shops on Callao in Recoleta."

It is very busy street market that sells everything from tacky imports through to fine antiques oh and fruit & veg if you need something to go with your dinner. In amongst all of this are magicians, tango dancers, music bands, mime artists and just about every conceivable type of life imaginable. A very long street which got very crowded but at all times it felt safe & fun. Lots of street food or restaurants to eat in - or just sit & watch the world go past. Look out for the antique jewelry shops - sheer amount of stock is glitteringly impressive. By chance we happened on Museo Penitenciario - 378 Humberto Primero - museopenitenciario.spf.gov.ar which couldn't find in Tripadvisor listings. Free and worth a look to see what was a working prison dating back to the 18th century looks like."

Be prepared for crowds, it can get a bit congested in certain areas. I have to put in a BIG recommendation for the most incredible empanadas being sold there by a darling couple, Anna Marie and Martin! They are in the same location every Sunday selling their empanadas. The empanadas are large, stuffed end to end with a wonderful ground beef filling. Their empanadas are fried (but not greasy) rather than baked as you will find everywhere else. I think this is Tucuman style. Don't miss out on these!"

If you're into antiques, it's great -- otherwise, kind of boring after a few minutes. However, if you go on Sunday, and get out of the flea market, there are stalls as far as the eye can see. We ended up buying some decorative pieces from here at reasonable prices. Definitely something to see on Sunday, outside in the streets. We actually walked all the way to Casa Rosada without realizing it. Watch your stuff as it's a narrow street, and probably an ideal place for pick pocketers. There is so much going on that you almost miss the building facades and can be sensory overload. Overall, worth the visit, but you don't have to walk the whole thing to get the gist of it. Interesting but very touristy."

After walking all morning through Recoleta Cemetary and the parks, we were tired so took a taxi to the San Telmo area and walked toward the plaza. Saw lots of vendors selling antiques and souvenirs. When we got to the plaza there was a group in one corner and sure enough a couple was dancing tango. They looked great and we watched for awhile. Glad to throw some coins into the hat they passed at the end. Far cheaper than the tango clubs! And still gave us a flavor of the dance."

The feria on Sundays is the biggest in Buenos Aires, and a good place to people watch and buy gifts for your family. The only reason why I can't give it 5 stars, is that it seems a bit dangerous at night, as there are a lot of drunks, homeless people, and somewhat scary looking people walking around. There are also places where it is quite dirty, with trashed piled up on the street corners."

There is an Antiques Fair here, but for us the highlight was just walking through the streets and visiting the market stalls in the street or in the square. There is a huge variety of quite unique shops (there's a great chocolate shop with innovative and really novel packaging) and the best selection of leather goods - apart from Calle Gurruchaga, 861 Palermo, an area of outlet shops with quality goods at reasonable prices.San Telmo is a great place to go on a Sunday to soak up the atmosphere and visit really different types of shops - a really worthwhile experience."

Hopefully you have a Saturday and Sunday in Buenos Aires to explore all the awesome artesenal markets in the city- they are excellent!This is a huge long street of markets for about 30 blocks! awesome!San Telmo in itself is such an antique place with a good lot of history. The buildings are fantastic and has some good little hidden restaurants and bars. I have heard there are some good backpackers places to stay in San Telmo also. A great place for people who want to use public transport like the subway and buses!have you camera ready- San Telmo is vibey and fun!"

Explored the market for an entire day looking at the crafts; saw tango on the street, bought art, and marvelled at the beautiful architechture... it had so much character.Tourists beware. Neighborhood exploration here puts you at risk for theft. Gaurd your posessions. Although my wife and I were spared, I'm sure there are many pickpocketers.We decided it was best to stay in Palermo, even though San Telmo was our favorite spot in BA to visit."

World-class antiques are everywhere with street entertainers putting a smile on faces from young to old. Truly not to be missed!"

Busied up as it got later. The antiques are amazing (wish we had similar in Scotland) and lentiful. The atmosphere was very Buenos Airian, with live tango, loud tango music and street performers.Veering off from the main square are the antique shops with some of the most extravagant wares I have ever seen, ranging from toys and jewellery to furniture and lighting. Old churches, side streets, bars and eateries all contribute to the experience.Be wary of bar prices though, I noticed a 400% mark up on the price of a Quilmes in a bar on the square. Still though, it's probably what I expected.Go and see for yourself, there's no words can really explain the great atmosphere."

I really think there is something here for everyone.Flea markets/antique stores: Just a walk down Defensa Street to Mercado de San Telmo sets the vibe for these. If you can't find something the suits your fancy then the Sunday antique/artisan fair at Plaza Dorrego will fill the void.Restaurants: Too numerous to mention. I visited Bar el Federal (see separate review) but there is a cuisine to fit anyone's taste.Mafalda: The famous Argentine cartoon character is found on the corner of Chile and Defensa. She's cute!Museums: El Zanyon (see separate review) sets the standard here. Other options include the Modern Art museum and Museo del Cine. There is plenty of history here, you just have to peel back the layers a bit.Atmosphere: Well, this is what brings it down from five to four stars, largely because I visited during the winter (end of July). Needless to say there was a shortage of street performers and entertainers here at the time so I didn't really appreciate the atmosphere that much; I will defer on that to other reviewers."

Arriving at San Juan station on the C Line, we were warned by a local to take care whilst in the area. However, we saw little sign of any trouble en route to Plaza Dorrego or in the square itself. As you walk further south down Calle Defensa, the area becomes decidedly edgier. But we still felt fairly safe. Be aware of your possessions and the people around you, and you will have a good and safe time.The antiques market itself was quite interesting. I particularly enjoyed the soda siphon stores.I\u2019d definitely recommend paying the area a visit on a Sunday and would have liked to have stayed for longer."

These places have very special unpretentious vibe created by timeless surroundings. Besides others already mentioned in previous reviews Krakow Cafe Bar on Venezuela 474 right of Defensa comes to mind. You think of an old tavern or pub when you enter the place filled with friendly crowd and then you spot the Nintendo Wii and hear the latest music.Trust me, the experience is unforgettable, so plan to spend an evening in San Telmo."

I am an American woman traveling alone in BA (very saavy world traveler), and yesterday afternoon/evening in Plaza Dorrego I was robbed not once, but TWICE --different occasions. The first time I bought something from a seemingly nice young street vendor who subsequently sat down with me to talk afterwards at the outside table of the Cafe Dorrego. Well, long story short, he tried to run off with my very expensive, professional Nikon that was sitting on the table directly in front of me. I had some other people around me and we stopped him. Very upsetting. Again, I did not walk away from my camera, it was just sitting directly in front of me, and the man seemed so nice.The second time a waiter from a restaurant I had never been to called me over to tell me he had my passport. I said no you dont! He said YES I DO! ??????? My passport was zipped into the inside of my purse in a very secure pocket. Not anymore! Apparantly he retrieved it for me when he saw some men with it. Very bizarre. Again, I am not a careless woman, and it wasn\u00b4t that late in the evening.Also, beware of the cute little kids everywhere in BA. They also tried to run off with my stuff while their mother watched."

LODGING:We stayed at the Hotel Internacional on the main drag, may be a 1/4 mile from the obelisk (sp?). Good hotel, rooms were clean, staff was accommodating. They were redoing some of the marble in the lobby. From what we saw during our stay, it's gonna look great when it's done. There's a place right next door that makes a mean empenada de pollo. A few of those and a great big Quilmes, and I was loving life! Head out the front door and hang a left, they're right there. FOOD/DRINKS/NIGHTLIFEIf you like wine and beef, you will think you've died and gone to heaven. There was the greatest little resto bar in the San Telmo section of the city called Todo Mundo! Address is Anselmo Aieta 1095 tel is 4362-2354. I wish I could boast that my memory is just THAT good, but I snagged a napkin with their info on it before we left. I keep it in my wallet as a reminder of our trip. Their house red is some sort of malbec and it was so good, we brought a few bottles home with us. Live music every night we were there, and a tango show upstairs in the the balcony. There was a little old lady selling roses, which was cute the 1st night. not so much the 2nd, 3rd or 4th night.This is a prime wine growing region, so treat this like a trip to napa valley. Try as many wines as you can. Don't stick with the \"safe\" choices. With a 3:1 exchange rate in favor of the American dollar, you really can't go wrong. If you like Beef, this is gonna be your town. There are awesome restaurantes everywhere, but there's a place called La Estancia. It's on one of the foot-traffic malls. Can't remember the name of the mall now, but some of the taxi drivers know the restaurante by name. I had one of the best meals of my life there. Don't let the cafeteria look of the place run you off. They bring out your food on a huge platter with hot coals in another pan underneath it to keep it piping hot. Just remembering the smell is enough to get my mouth watering again. SHOPPINGSince this city serves up so much beef, they have to do something wih all of that leather. Oddly enough, the leather prices rivaled those in America, but after you take the exchange rate into account, you make out on the deal. There are leather shops literally everywhere.SAFETYJust remember where you're from. If you're an American, bear in mind you might not be very popular with some people there. Fortunately, the police presence in this city was pretty strong. Could have had something to do with the protests that were going on that week. If you stick to the touristy areas you should be fine."

Just when I think I know San Telmo I turn a corner and something else (new or old) is there.

After living in Buenos Aires for 3 months, this was my favourite place. The Antiques Market definitely lives up to its reputation. Busy, exciting, entertaining, different - this place is unmissable. Aside from the antiques shops and market, there are various crafts fairs along the side streets, tango dancers and musicians giving free (fantastic) performances, great eateries and other street performers like puppeteers and statue men. Great for kids aswell as adults. You feel like you've been transported back in time with the cobbled streets and the ancient looking shop fa\u00e7ades. However, don't go on any other day than Sunday - its really quiet and you'll be sorely disappointed."
